Life The von der Deckens are an old noble family in Lower Saxony which produced several officers for the forces of the Electorate of Hanover. In 1784 Johann Friedrich joined the army, fighting in the French Revolutionary Wars from 1793 to 1795. He headed a military journal with his friend Gerhard von Scharnhorst, the Prussian military reformer for many years. In 1803 he joined the diplomatic service on Napoleon's occupation of Hanover and left for the United Kingdom. On 28 July 1803 he began together with Sir Colin Halkett recruiting expatriate Hanoverian soldiers to fight for the United Kingdom in the War of the Third Coalition and subsequent Napoleonic conflicts, with his recruits forming the King's German Legion, with which he fought from 1805 to 1807.North Ludlow Beamish: History of the King's German Legion, 2 vols. London, 1834-7, Vol. 1 p. 80 Vol. 2 In 1808 he was sent to Spain and Portugal during the Peninsular War as a diplomat and military advisor and to recruit troops to fight against France, before returning to England, where in 1815 he organised another Hanoverian regiment to fight against the French during the Hundred Days. After the war he refused military decorations from the Netherlands and Prussia. In 1817 he bought the former Benedictine monastery in Ringelheim and rebuilt it as his country house, the Schloss und Park Ringelheim, spending his retirement there from 1833, the year in which he was made a count (Graf).

H√∏vringen is the main entrance to Rondane National Park, the first national park in Norway. History Originally, H√∏vringen was a community of summer mountain pastures () used by farmers from the villages further down. The first tourists came to H√∏vringen as early as the 1880s, and even though it has now developed into a modern tourist resort, the animal life is still rich and high standards and good service are combined with preservation of the culture and tradition of the old seter farms. Tourism The culture and traditions of the old mountain pasture community are still well preserved, and today H√∏vringen has about 1000 guest beds including everything from simple self-catering cabins and a mountain school camp to several mountain lodges and hotels. In addition, over 200 privately owned cottages have been built in the area. H√∏vringen and its surrounding area has 120 km of prepared cross-country tracks and 50 km of marked tracks within Rondane National Park. The marked summer hiking trails expands for more than 150 km both within and outside Rondane National Park. Culture H√∏vringen and Rondane have left their mark in Norwegian cultural history. On his journey through the Gudbrand Valley, Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen, well known for his compilations of old Norwegian legends and fairy-tales, stayed in H√∏vringen in 1842. His stay formed the basis for the story of a local legend, Peer Gynt, who came upon trolls and terrifying monsters in Rondane. Asbj√∏rnsen's fairy-tale Reindeer hunt at Rondane 20 years later created the basis for Henrik Ibsen's drama Peer Gynt. In The Bridal Wreath, the first part of Sigrid Undset's trilogy Kristin Lavransdatter, the young protagonist, Kristin, is allowed to accompany her father up into the mountains. Here, H√∏vringen is depicted with an atmosphere of great legend and superstition. It is no exaggeration to say that Kristin was very impressed by her first sight of H√∏vringen and the Rondane mountain range: \\"Kristin gazed with great eyes- never before had she dreamed that the world was so big and wide. Forest-shagged ranges lay below her on all sides; the valley was but a cleft betwixt the huge fells, and the side-glens still lesser clefts; there were many such, yet was there little of dale and much of fell. All around grey peaks, flaming with golden lichen, rose above the sea of forest, and far off, on the very brink of heaven, stood blue crests flashing here and there with snow, and melting, before their eyes, into the grey-blue and pure white summer clouds. But north-eastwards, nearer by- just beyond the s√¶ter woods- lay a cluster of mighty slate-coloured domes with streaks of new-fallen snow down their slopes.\\" Writer Aasmund Olavsson Vinje gave Rondane a central position in his poetic travelogue Ferdaminne. His poem Ved Rondane was later set to music by Edvard Grieg, who also wrote music for Ibsen's play. Painters Erik Werenskiold, Hans Gude and not least Harald Solberg have all found motives in Rondane for their works. Solberg's A winter's night in Rondane has been voted the national painting of Norway.

Life  Bashinjaghian was born on 16 September 1857 in a small town of Sighnaghi in eastern Georgian province of Kakheti, part of the Russian Empire at the time. His father, Zakar, died in 1872 during a trip to Persia, when he was 15. After finishing the local school, he was admitted to the Arts School. In 1878, Bashinjaghian moved to the Russian capital St. Petersburg, where he became a student at the Imperial Academy of Arts a year later. Mikhail Clodt was one of his teachers. He graduated from the Academy in 1883, also winning a silver medal for his Birch Grove. He returned to his hometown Sighnaghi the same year and soon started to travel throughout the Caucasus: Lake Sevan, Yerevan, Ashtarak and the holy capital of the Armenian Church - Ejmiatsin, Georgia and the Northern Caucasus, which caused the artist to make a row of canvas of the local landscapes. During the next year, Bashinjaghian visited Italy and Switzerland, where he learnt about the classic European art and also saw the Alps. He later wrote that \\"the Alps are beautiful, but they cannot win your heart if you have seen the Caucasus.\\" He returned to Russia and settled in Tiflis, the largest city of the Caucasus and the cultural center of Armenians of Russia. In 1890s Bashinjaghian had exhibitions in Moscow, Odessa, St. Petersburg and Novocherkassk. In 1897, he created a series of oil painting of Ani, the medieval Armenian capital of thousand churches. From 1899 to 1901, Bashinjaghian lived in Paris with his wife Ashkhen Katanian and their three children. In France, he made a trip throughout the country and produced over 30 paintings. In 1923 Bashinjaghian became a member of the Armenian Artists' Society. Bashinjaghian died on 4 October 1925 in Tiflis and was buried at the side of Sayat-Nova's tomb in the backyard of Saint George Cathedral. Exhibitions of Bashinjaghian's works were held in Yerevan, Moscow St. Petersburg and Riga, many of them in 1957-1958, in memory of the 100th anniversary of his birth. A street in Yerevan is named after him. Works Bashinjaghian's best known works include Birch Grove (1883), Alazani Valley (1902), Ararat (1912). All are in the National Gallery of Armenia in Yerevan.

Saint-Gabriel is a town in the Lanaudi√®re region of Quebec, Canada, part of the D'Autray Regional County Municipality. It is located on the shores of Lake Maskinong√©, in the shadows of the Laurentian Mountains. History The first settlers were Loyalists, Irish, and Scottish, arriving around 1825 to the shores of Lake Maskinong√©, where they formed a community that was known as Lake Maskinong√© Settlement by 1827, and later as the Mission of Lac-Maskinong√©. In 1837, the name Saint-Gabriel-du-Lac-Maskinong√© came in use but was changed to Saint-Gabriel-de-Brandon in 1840. This name refers to the angel Gabriel and the geographic township of Brandon that was proclaimed in 1827 and in which it is located. In 1851, the Parish of Saint-Gabriel-de- Brandon was founded and the post office opened that same year. In 1855, the Saint-Gabriel-de-Brandon Parish Municipality was established and the town of Saint-Gabriel remained part of this parish municipality until 1892, when it separated and became the Village Municipality of Saint-Gabriel-de-Brandon. In 1967, it changed its status and name to Ville de Saint-Gabriel by then Mayor Yvan Comeau.

Often compared to cheese fondue, it is a party dish; it is popular at cookouts and in restaurants as an appetizer. Almost unique in Mexican cuisine, in the cuisine of the United States this dish has been widely adapted and is considered a native dish in El Paso. In Mexico, it occurs in restaurants more often in the north. Typical main ingredients are melted cheese and a characteristic meat sauce of loose fresh chorizo, tomato, onion, chile and spices. It is served in a small, shallow casserole or other ceramic or metal heat-proof baking dish. The cheese and sauce are prepared separately, and combined just before serving. This may be done at the table, especially if finished with a flamb√©: high alcohol liquor is poured on the cheese and ignited, and as it burns the server folds in the sauce. If not flamb√©ed, the mixture may be quickly broiled. Either way, the finished dish is presented while it is still bubbling hot, and it is spooned onto small soft tortillas for individual servings. Queso flameado is said to originate in the borderlands of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, as a campfire dish. In Tex-Mex restaurants, this dish is sometimes confused or conflated with chili con queso, a cheese sauce served with tortilla chips for dipping. The term queso fundido also refers to processed cheese and is defined as such in the Spanish version of Codex Alimentarius. Variations Both the cheese and the meat sauce are prepared just before serving, and are served hot. Oaxaca cheese and Chihuahua cheese are popular, but other melting cheeses (cheeses such as whole milk mozzarella, that remain stringy when melted) may be used. Some consider stringy cheese to be an essential part of this dish, but if this quality is not desired then a fresh farmer's cheese or goat cheese is a good alternative. If fresh chorizo is not available, pieces of dry chorizo or another sausage may be used. Common additions are strips of roasted chiles and saut√©ed mushrooms. For the flamb√©, popular liquors include rum, brandy, and tequila. Either type of tortilla, corn or wheat, may be used. In Puerto Vallarta, flour tortillas usually are served only with certain dishes including queso flameado, corn tortillas otherwise being the norm.

Maggs. Dictionary of Oriental Rugs. London: AD. Donker LTD, 1977. Eiland, Murray L. Oriental Rugs.Boston: New York Graphic Society, 1976. Konya carpets are named for the region in which they were made. Renamed from the Greek ‚ÄúIconium‚Äù when the Seljuk Sultans of Rum made it their capital, Konya is one of the largest, oldest and continuously occupied cities in Asia Minor. When Polo wrote of the Konyas, he had probably seen them in manufactories that were attached to the Seljuk courts. In the early 20th century, large carpets were found in the Alaadin Mosque in Konya; they are now housed in the Museum of Turkish and Islamic Arts in Istanbul. Scholars and collectors alike, primarily for their bold tribal designs and magnificent color combinations not to mention their rarity, covet Konya rugs. Classification Konya rugs being made today include those coming from surrounding regions: Kecimuhsine, Karapinar, Obruk and Taspinar. All of these regions are included in \\"Greater Konya\\", although distinctions can be made between types. Nomadic rugs falling under the Konya region are also known as Y√∂r√ºks. In a sense Konyas are the Turkish counterparts to Caucasian Kazakhs, though they are generally older and far rarer, and are no less sought after by collectors. Wool Konya rugs are prized for their luxurious wool, which comes from the rural areas surrounding the city. The wool from these regions is known to be some of the richest worldwide. Colors Older pieces are characterized by the restraint towards color combinations and their use of earth tones (most notably: soft yellow, terracotta and browns). The wefts of the Konya rugs are always red, distinguishing them from other Persian carpets. The Nomadic pieces within this genre usually have a foundation of dark wool or goat hair. Design and structure Incorporated within Konya carpets are hexagonal and basic figures. These patterns are tribal motifs. Geometries are either arranged in neat rows or staggered throughout the field. A common geometric motif is the \\"Memling gul\\", a geometric medallion patterned throughout the carpet. These rugs also feature a fairly loose knotting technique.

The Knitting Guild Association (TKGA) is a 501c3 non-profit organization dedicated to providing education and resources to knitters to advance their mastery of the craft of knitting. TKGA supports serious knitters in their efforts to perpetuate traditional techniques and keep the artisan aspects and high quality standards of the craft alive. It has over 5,000 members in the United States and abroad, and is dedicated to promoting knitting and knitting education. It was founded in 1984. TKGA publishes Cast On magazine quarterly. According to the TKGA, Cast On is \\"the Educational Journal for Knitters\\" and is filled with valuable lessons and patterns for all levels of knitting. Members can take TKGA correspondence courses by mail. Members also have access to articles and free patterns in a members-only area of the TKGA website. TKGA Certification programs are the gold standard in knitting. These programs are not classes, but research programs where you study techniques, history and design. Then you knit swatches and projects that demonstrate your expertise as well as submit written work that demonstrates your understanding. Volunteers review your work and provide detailed feedback to enable you to improve. The certification programs include: Master Hand Knitting Certification: Members can enroll in the Master Hand Knitting Program, an extensive three-level program.Masters Program, undated, Access date: 22 October 2012 Each level includes over 18 to 20 swatches to be knit, questions to answer, patterns to write, book and magazine reviews On Your Way to the Masters - The \\"Write\\" Stuff by Sharon Levering February - April 2014, Access Date 21 February 2020, and papers to research and write.Suitable for Framing, \\"TKGA's Master Hand Knitting Program (3 Levels)\\", 2004, Access date: 22 October 2012 The culminating tasks are the design and knitting of a hat and a sweater, of which one has to be in the Fair Isle style and the other Aran.

Professional Knitter Certification, undated, Access date: 21 February 2020 Unlike the Master Hand Knitting Program, the Professional Knitter Certification does not require that the candidate design garments, write patterns, or research and write reports. The focus of this certification is the actual knitted work. The swatches and projects will demonstrate the candidate‚Äôs ability to interpret instructions and patterns as well as identify potential pattern errors. Each module does include questions but they will require no research, just observation. Work for each module must be submitted within one year of the module‚Äôs purchase. If the deadline is missed, the course must be repurchased. The next module must be ordered within 6 month of completing the previous module. An important part of this program is time management. Certification for Knitting Judges: Knitting competitions are great settings for knitters to gather and share their craft. Along with encouraging creativity, they promote high standards. They impart a sense of pride in presenting quality work and they are fun for both participants and observers. This course is intended to prepare you to judge knitting competitions. The Knitting Judges Certification Course is TKGA‚Äôs original certification course and now includes information for internet judging and competitions that are new to the fiber community. Certification for Knitting Judges, undated, Access date: 21 February 2020 Certification for Technical Editors: All designers, knitting magazine editors, yarn companies, and writers of knitting books need Technical Editors. They depend on their tech editors to help them produce error-free patterns and articles that knitters can enjoy knitting and reading. In this course, the goal is to help knitters learn the skills needed to become a knowledgeable and astute technical editor for knitting. Master Knitters have already demonstrated a mastery of advanced knitting skills, and technical editing is one way of applying those skills. Certification will mean that knitters have acquired these necessary skills and can market themselves as a Technical Editor. Certification for Technical Editors, undated, Access date: 21 February 2020 Certification for Knitting Instructors: The goal of this course is to prepare knitters to instruct knitting.

The school has held several campuses but is now located in Riverview, Michigan. History The antecedent school, the Goldsmith Business College, was founded by W. D. Cochrane and located at the corner of Larned and Woodward Avenue about four blocks north of the Detroit River. In 1857 Cochrane sold the school to Bryant and Stratton, who moved it to the Merrill Block where J. H. Goldsmith managed the institution as a branch of Bryant & Stratton College. When the Detroit Business University was formed Goldsmith was its first president. In 1874 the institution moved to the corner of Griswold Street and Lafayette Avenue. Spencerian Business College was a successor of the Mayhew Business College that had operated in Albion, Michigan beginning in 1859 The Detroit Business University was founded in 1887 by the merger of Spencerian Business College (founded in 1883) and Goldsmith Business College (founded in 1850). One of its early presidents was William F. Jewell, while Platt R. Spencer, who had headed the Spencerian Business College, was the head of the school's penmanship department.

In the 1930s the institution was still known as the Detroit Business University, but apparently by the 1950s it had changed its name to the Detroit Business Institute. In the 1960s it began a collegiate institute in Dearborn, Michigan. In 1964 this became the Detroit College of Business and it later split off and became part of Davenport University.

A. Ezra Pound: Poet. Oxford University Press, 2007, p. xiii. Origins William's exact origins have challenged descendants and researchers over the centuries. Recent researchers have postulated that the William Wadsworth, who is born 1594 in Long Buckby, Northamptonshire, England and baptized on 26 February 1594, the son of William and Elizabeth Wadsworth, is one and the same as the subject of this article. This is not proven, though his age, place and onomastics point strongly to this connection. New England William Wadsworth's name appears on the top of a list of those who have taken the \\"Oath of Allegiance\\" and desired to be \\"transported to New England\\", dated 22 June 1632. William Wadsworth is found, again, at the top, on the list of 123 passengers on the ship Lion, who arrived in Boston Harbor, Massachusetts Colony on Sunday, September 16, 1632. He states his wife and three children are with him. Soon after his arrival to Boston he moved to \\"Newtowne\\" now Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was made a Freeman of this town on 2 November 1632. He built his home on the west side of Holyoke Street near Harvard Square. He was chosen to be on the Board of Selectmen for Newtowne, and held this position from 1634 to 1635. To Hartford William Wadsworth was one of the original Founders of Hartford, Connecticut. In 1635 Rev. Thomas Hooker and his followers from Chelmsford, England had arrived to Newtowne and soon, after dissenting with Puritan leaders in Massachusetts, made up their minds, in council, to move westward. In June 1636, William moved with his family and others of the congregation to a settlement they named Hartford. He was an original proprietor of the town. His home-lot, in 1639, was on the west side of the map from Seth Grant's to Sentinel Hill, extending along what is now the south side of Asylum St., from Trumbull St. to Ford St. At Hartford, William was active in the community and held prominent public office positions throughout his life. William was chosen \\"Townsman\\" of Hartford in 1642, 1655, 1661, and again in 1673; he was also chosen Constable in 1651; he was the town's List and Rate Maker in 1668; he was elected Deputy Constable nearly every session between October 1656 and May 1675 [probably due to age and failing health]. William died in 1675. His will was dated 16 June 1675 and it was inventoried on 18 October 1675 at a value of ¬£1677. 13. 9. (approx. $300,000 US).

Construction The building was originally constructed as an office by E.L. Van Gilder of Kellogg, Idaho, who decided to invest in the Alaska Territory. Van Gilder purchased the property adjacent to the Seward bank for $4,000 in February 1916. He obtained supplies in Idaho, and then returned to Seward via the steamer Evans with his wife and daughter. Construction for the two-story structure with an excavated basement began in May 1916. In addition to offices, the building would have meeting halls for local organizations. During construction, Van Gilder decided to add a third story to the building. Extra construction costs and a poor economy forced Van Gilder to sell the building shortly after it was completed. The new building was purchased by Charles Brown, a partner in the Brown & Hawkins Store in Seward. The Van Gilders planned to return to the states and travelled to Ketchikan, Alaska via boat. While in the town waiting for the boat to leave, Van Gilder and his wife Sarah were both offered jobs. They stayed for a year and earned money to invest in business in St. Helens, Oregon. Rooms and Guests Upon completion, the first and second floors contained 27 rooms, while the basement had seven. The third floor held a Masonic and Odd Fellows lodge rooms, as well as meeting space for the Christian Scientists and the Seward Women's Club. Tenants on the lower floor included the law firm Morford & Finnigan, a doctor, and the Alaska Importing Company. The basement held offices for the Gateway Newspaper. The newspaper was the second in Alaska to join the Associated Press and had been called the second-largest paper in Alaska in 1915. In early 1921 the building was converted to apartments. Joe Badger, who came to Alaska from Chelsea, Massachusetts during the gold rush in Nome, served as manager. Badger took over ownership in September, and had the building converted again, this time to serve as a hotel. Early guests to the hotel included salesman, railroad, and government officials including Austin E. Lathrop, a prominent Alaskan industrialist. In 1923 when Warren G. Harding became the first U.S. president to visit the territory, many of the executives stayed in the Van Gilder. In 1924, Seward and the Van Gilder were a stop for the Army Air Service team that made the first aerial circumnavigation of the globe. The four pilots and their crews landed their Douglas World Cruiser aircraft‚Äîthe Boston, Chicago, New Orleans, and Seattle‚Äîin Resurrection Bay. The event was the first time many of the 1,000 residents saw an airplane. Varied Owners Ownership passed hands several more times, and the hotel was known as \\"Hotel Renwald\\" during parts of the 1950s and 1960s. For a time the building was leased to the state and served as a dormitory for the Seward Skills Center. When the state's lease expired in 1978 the building was refurbished and has served as a hotel since. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

She was unofficially known as \\"Kronprinsesse Caroline\\" (English: Crown Princess Caroline) prior to her marriage, and later as \\"Arveprinsesse Caroline\\" (English: Hereditary Princess Caroline). She married her father's first cousin, Hereditary Prince Ferdinand, who was heir presumptive to the throne from 1848 to 1863.Kongeriget Danmark--Personalregister til Trap - Volume 1 - Page 144 Early life Princess Caroline, c. 1820s Princess Caroline was born at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen on 28 October 1751. Her parents were Crown Prince Frederick (the future King Frederick VI of Denmark) and his spouse and first cousin, Princess Marie of Hesse-Kassel. Her paternal grandfather King Christian VII being mentally unstable, her father had acted as regent since 1784. Her birth was much welcomed by the public, as her siblings had died soon after their birth. Four months after her birth, on 26 February 1794, Christiansborg Palace was destroyed by fire. Subsequently, Princess Caroline moved with her parents to Amalienborg Palace where she grew up, spending the summers at Frederiksberg Palace. At the death of her grandfather Christian VII of Denmark in 1808, her father ascended as king. Marriage Princess Caroline and her husband Prince Ferdinand as Hereditary Prince, c. 1863 She had a very close relationship with her father. She was given a broad, but not very thorough or deep, education. Caroline was not described as either talented or beautiful. She met Hans Christian Andersen in 1822 and was very interested in his writing and adventure. Her father had no surviving sons and Caroline and her sister Vilhelmine Marie (1808-1891), were excluded from succession to the throne as a result of Salic Law. Despite of this fact, however, she was still commonly called and referred to as Crown Princess prior to her marriage, as the eldest child of her father, though she did not have the formal title. Several possible marriages were planned for her but without result. After her father's accession, Napoleon suggested, in 1810, a marriage with the heir to the Swedish throne, Prince Christian August of Augustenborg; her father disapproved but began negotiations, which were interrupted by the death of Christian August shortly afterward. Among the grooms suggested was also the British Prince William, Duke of Clarence. In 1812, she was engaged to her uncle Prince Christian of Hesse, but he died in 1814. Finally, on 1 August 1829 at Frederiksberg Palace she married her father's first cousin, Prince Ferdinand of Denmark (1792-1863) who was third in line to the throne. The marriage was arranged for political reasons and was childless. After her marriage, she was no longer called crown princess until her spouse became hereditary prince. In 1830, Caroline suffered terrible burn injuries in a fire, which disfigured her face; her hair ornament caught fire while she was reading in her bed, and she was severely burnt in the face and hair. The damage upon her looks was permanent, and she was later to remark, when she caught a glimpse of herself in a mirror, that she was sincerely grateful that she managed to acquire any friends who could stand to look at her face. She suffered a similar burn injury in 1858 when she burned her arm and shoulder so badly, that she had great pains for the rest of her life. Between 1831 and 1839, she presided regularly at the supervision of the Aarhus troops. When her spouse was appointed General Commandant for N√∏rrejylland in 1839, she followed him on his inspection tour through the county's villages, and was celebrated by the public; she was a skillful rider, and when she followed her spouse on his inspections of the troops in Sj√¶lland, she paraded herself on horse before the troops. She founded an asylum in Aarhus (1836) and became the protector of Vall√∏ Stift in 1852. Hereditary Princess Sculpted bust of Hereditary Princess Caroline, by Bertel Thorvaldsen Bernstorff After the death of her brother-in-law King Christian VIII in 1848, her husband became heir presumptive to the throne of Denmark and received the title of Hereditary Prince. Caroline now became hereditary princess again, but in contrast to the case before her marriage, she now received the title formally. She never became queen however, as Hereditary Prince Ferdinand died in 1863, shortly before his nephew King Frederick VII, and the throne passed to King Christian IX. The spouses lived in Bernstorff Palace (Det Bernstorffske Pal√¶) in Bredgade which had been renovated for them by King Frederick VI, but did not play any active role at the royal court. Caroline eventually came to live quite harmoniously with her spouse. She tolerated his adultery and money problems. After her father's death in 1839, she became distanced from court. Her spouse was given the task of escorting royal mistress Countess Danner (1815‚Äì1874) while she was estranged from the royal couple. She was described as loyal, content and punctual She was especially loyal toward Copenhagen. She and her husband were the only members of the royal family during the cholera epidemic of 1853 out of loyalty to the city. As a widow, she lived an isolated life, occupying herself by paying her husband's debts. During her final years, she became deaf. Hereditary Princess Caroline died in her residence in Copenhagen on 31 March 1881.

Vol S. 315 ff which ended with the words:  After Waterloo  The King's German Legion was dissolved after Waterloo and Baring joined the newly formed army of the Kingdom of Hanover, in which he became oberst in the Garde-Grenadier-Regiment (26 December 1828) and from 1830 as Fl√ºgel-Adjutant in the general staff. In 1831, the year in which his Erz√§hlung der Teilnahme des 2. Leichten Bataillons der Kgl. Deutschen Legion an der Schlacht von Waterloo (History of the Participation of the 2nd Light Infantry Battalion of the King's German Legion at the Battle of Waterloo) was published in a Hanoverian military journal, he held the rank of Brigade-Kommandeur. On 18 June 1832, the seventeenth anniversary of Waterloo, he and his descendants were made Freiherrs by William IV (then still king of Hanover) in recognition of his war service and made Hanover's city commander. In 1834 he rose to Generalmajor then in 1846 to Generalleutnant. Memorials A street in Hanover city-centre is named after him and a small memorial stone is dedicated in front of the Hauptstaatsarchiv Hannover near the present-day regional parliament and the former royal palace.

He grew up in Boxmoor, Hertfordshire, and studied at Rugby School, New College, Oxford and Mansfield College, serving as President of the Oxford Union. Career In 1914, he was ordained as a Congregationalist minister, serving at Highbury Chapel, then briefly in Wythenshawe, from which he was removed due to his opposition to the First World War. Micklem then worked for the YMCA in Dieppe before becoming the chaplain of Mansfield College. In 1921, he began teaching the Old Testament at Selly Oak Colleges and also started writing on the topic. He moved to Kingston, Ontario in 1927, to teach the New Testament at the Queen's Theological College, who made him an honorary Doctor of Divinity. He returned to Mansfield College in 1932, serving for a year as vice-principal, then until 1953 as principal of the college. While at the college, Micklem wrote extensively on the need for Congregationalists to adopt \\"orthodox\\" Christianity, seeing reason as founded in faith, rather than the other way around. In the late 1930s, he visited Germany twice, bringing back literature from the German Confessing Church. He published National Socialism and the Roman Catholic Church in 1939, and broadcast a weekly radio show during the war focussing on Christianity in Europe. In contrast to the First World War, Micklem strongly supported the Second World War. He is the author of The Labyrinth, a \\"philosophical poem\\" consisting of 100 Spenserian stanzas, published by Oxford Uiversity Press in 1945. Micklem served as chairman of the Congregational Union in 1944. He was part of the joint Anglican and non- conformist committee which wrote Church Relations in England in 1950, and championed the merger with Presbyterians which produced the United Reformed Church.

The term periagua overlaps, but is not synonymous with, pirogue, derived through the French language from piragua. The original periaguas or piraguas were the dugout canoes encountered by the Spanish in the Caribbean. Small craft of greater capacity were created by splitting a dugout and inserting a plank bottom, while the freeboard was increased for sea voyages by adding planks on the sides. By the 18th century the term periagua was being applied to flat-bottomed boats, which could be 30 feet (10 m) or more long and carry up to 30 men, with one or two masts, which could also be rowed. Later in the 18th century periagua became the name for a specific type of sailing rig, with gaff rigged sails on two masts that could be easily struck, commonly with the foremast raked forward and the main mast raked back. The \\"periagua rig\\" was used on U. S. Navy gunboats on Chesapeake Bay in the early 19th century.

A lunchtime tradition for years, the program features the reading of works of fiction, history and biography virtually in their entirety, by a professional radio performer in half-hour increments. History The beginning of Chapter a Day remains unclear, but a popular legend is told by Jim Fleming, a Chapter a Day performer for the last twenty years and a Wisconsin Public Radio employee since the 1970s. Jim tells the story that sometime in the late 1920s Harold McCarty, the man who was most responsible for the creation of what has become Wisconsin Public Radio, was in the studio waiting for a guest who didn't show up. McCarty was left with the prospect of dead air - something no broadcaster can countenance. He pulled the book he was currently reading out of his briefcase, opened it up and began to read out loud into the microphone. McCarty's reading was so popular, and drew so many responses of \\"what came next?\\" that it has been on the air ever since. Fleming says this story is true in spirit if not provable in fact. After all, Chapter a Day is all about storytelling, and this is a really good story.Fleming, Jim. Personal interview. 21 October 2009. Actual records show that in the late 1920s there were sometimes Friday broadcasts that featured readings from classical literature by both University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison professors and students. The earliest documentation of the Chapter a Day title referring to the narration of an entire book is found for July 25, 1932 and lists the name of Marianne Smith, a member of the University of Wisconsin class of 1932, leading to the assumption that she was the reader. It is thought that she read the book David's Day by Denis Mackail.Davidson, Randall. 9XM Talking. Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press, 2006. p. 292. Chapter a Day appeared on the WHA (call letters for Wisconsin Public Radio) schedule intermittently from 1932 to 1939, often as part of the summer programming schedule, but became a year-round permanent feature of the radio station on April 3, 1939.Davidson, Randall. 9XM Talking. Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press, 2006. p. 301. A list of books read on the program dating back to 1939 does exist, meaning that Chapter a Day may well qualify as the longest running regularly scheduled radio program in the history of radio in the United States. Until the 1970s, books read on Chapter a Day were read live on the air by the narrators. The standard reading of a book was ten episodes so that each book aired for two weeks. Chapter a Day originally aired at 3 pm, but has been broadcast primarily at midday for most of its long lifetime for the convenience and enjoyment of lunchtime listeners.Davidson, Randall. 9XM Talking. Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press, 2006. p. 293. Performer history Although not the earliest reader on Chapter a Day, Karl Schmidt was recruited by Harold McCarty and began reading for the program in 1941, when he was a student at the University of Wisconsin.Penn, Michael. \\"Tuning Into A Legacy.\\" On Wisconsin Fall 1998: p. 38. Karl continued to read for the program until his death in 2016 at the age of 93, making him the longest serving reader of the program. Other readers over the years include Helen Darrah, Juanita Bauer, Marvin Bauer, Catherine Brand, Esther Hotton, Gerald Bartell, Sherwin \\"Sherry\\" Abrams, Ray Stanley, Tom Detienne, Myron Curry, Ken Ohst, radio actress Jay Meredith Fitts, Fannie Frazier Hicklin, Sybil Robinson, Ed Burrows, Kerry Frumkin, Jim Fleming, Judith Strasser, Norman Gilliland, Carol Cowan, Susan Sweeney, Michele Good, Michael Hanson, and Cliff Roberts.Davidson, Randall. 9XM Talking. Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press, 2006. p. 295. Current status Chapter a Day is aired Monday through Friday at 12:30 pm CT and repeated at 11 pm CT on the Ideas Network stations of Wisconsin Public Radio and through the network's webstream. Several weeks of content are available for on-demand listening or download on the program's website. Currently books are read by Michele Good, Jim Fleming, Norman Gilliland, Susan Sweeney and others. Performance preparation Narrators for Chapter a Day must possess certain skills and even training to perform this job effectively because while reading on the radio one can't use gestures to help tell the story. The characters of each book must be defined by means of tempo, pace, pitch and accents, using only the reader's voice. To prepare for a book reading on Chapter a Day a performer reads the book at least three times. The first time is to make sure it is conducive to being read on the air. The second time is to cut the book into half-hour increments and the third time is for broadcast. Often the performers will read the book a fourth time just before taping for broadcast, making sure that all the words and characters are understood. Book selections Book selections for Chapter a Day are made primarily by the radio station narrators and are typically approved by the Executive Producer, who rarely turns one down. Since 1977 permission must be granted for the public broadcast of a book by whoever owns the rights to the book. This means that not every book selected to be read actually goes on the air. Some works are edited for content and profanity with the author's permission to meet FCC decency guidelines. Since it is only possible to read eleven or twelve pages in a half hour time period, many books are simply too long, and others are edited so that they can be read in three or four weeks. There is a special effort to include books written by local Wisconsin authors. Another consideration in selecting books for the program is the number of characters involved in the story. Because many listeners don't listen every day they can become lost if the cast of characters is too large. But the primary consideration in book selection is that the story has a compelling narrative that will entertain the listener. Popularity Numerous area libraries and book stores report that when a book is read on Chapter a Day requests for that book increase. Many libraries and stores now request prior knowledge of a book's reading in order to have a greater number of copies available. The popularity of Chapter a Day is consistently high and there have been many years when Chapter a Day has been the most listened to program on the Ideas Network. As Fleming said, \\"There is something very basic and comforting about being read to that brings back an element of childhood and sitting on your grandfather's lap.\\" References External links *Chapter a Day official website on WPR.org Wisconsin Public Radio American public radio programs ","title":"Chapter a Day"},{"id":"25148723","text":"Nathaniel Micklem may refer to: * Nathaniel Micklem (politician) (1853‚Äì1954), British Liberal Member of Parliament * Nathaniel Micklem (theologian) (1888‚Äì1976), British theologian, political activist and college principal ","title":"Nathaniel Micklem"},{"id":"25148740","text":"Govedartsi () is a village located in Samokov Municipality, Sofia Province and a ski resort in the Rila Mountains of Bulgaria.

They were used for events such as gladiator combats, venationes (animal slayings) and executions. About 230 Roman amphitheatres have been found across the area of the Roman Empire. Early amphitheatres date from the Republican period, though they became more monumental during the Imperial era.Bomgardner, 61. Amphitheatres are distinguished from circuses and hippodromes, which were usually rectangular and built mainly for racing events, and stadia, built for athletics, but several of these terms have at times been used for one and the same venue. The word amphitheatrum means \\"theatre all around\\". Thus, an amphitheatre is distinguished from the traditional semicircular Roman theatres by being circular or oval in shape.Bomgardner, 37.  Components  Vomitorium of the Amphitheatre of El Jem, Tunisia The Roman amphitheatre consists of three main parts: the cavea, the arena, and the vomitorium. The seating area is called the cavea (Latin for \\"enclosure\\"). The cavea is formed of concentric rows of stands which are either supported by arches built into the framework of the building, or simply dug out of the hillside or built up using excavated material extracted during the excavation of the fighting area (the arena). The cavea is traditionally organised in three horizontal sections, corresponding to the social class of the spectators:Roman Architecture * The ima cavea is the lowest part of the cavea and the one directly surrounding the arena. It was usually reserved for the upper echelons of society. * The media cavea directly follows the ima cavea and was open to the general public, though mostly reserved for men. * The summa cavea is the highest section and was usually open to women and children. Similarly, the front row was called the prima cavea and the last row was called the cavea ultima. The cavea was further divided vertically into cunei. A cuneus (Latin for \\"wedge\\"; plural, cunei) was a wedge-shaped division separated by the scalae or stairways. The arched entrances both at the arena level and within the cavea are called the vomitoria (Latin \\"to spew forth\\"; singular, vomitorium) and were designed to allow rapid dispersal of large crowds. History Early amphitheatres The Amphitheatre of Pompeii in the 1800s, one of the earliest known Roman amphitheatres It is uncertain when and where the first amphitheatres were built. There are records attesting to temporary wooden amphitheatres built in the Forum Romanum for gladiatorial games from the second century BC onwards, and these may be the origin of the architectural form later expressed in stone. In his Historia Naturalis, Pliny the Elder claims that the amphitheatre was invented during the spectacles of Gaius Scribonius Curio in 53 BC, where two wooden semicircular theatres were rotated towards each other to form one circular amphitheatre, while spectators were still seated in the two halves. But while this may be the origin of the architectural term amphitheatrum, it cannot be the origin of the architectural concept, since earlier stone amphitheatres, known as spectacula or amphitheatera, have been found. According to Jean-Claude Golvin, the earliest known stone amphitheatres are found in Campania, at Capua, Cumae and Liternum, where such venues were built towards the end of the second century BC.Bomgardner, 59. The next-oldest amphitheatre known, as well as one of the best-researched, is the amphitheatre of Pompeii, securely dated to be built shortly after 70 BC.Bomgardner, 39. There are relatively few other known early amphitheatres: those at Abella, Teanum and Cales date to the Sullan era (until 78 BC), those at Puteoli and Telesia from the Augustan (27 BC‚Äì14 AD). The amphitheatres at Sutrium, Carmo and Ucubi were built around 40‚Äì30 BC, those at Antioch and Phaestum (Phase I) in the mid-first century BC. Imperial era In the Imperial era, amphitheatres became an integral part of the Roman urban landscape. As cities vied with each other for preeminence in civic buildings, amphitheatres became ever more monumental in scale and ornamentation. Imperial amphitheatres comfortably accommodated 40,000‚Äì60,000 spectators, or up to 100,000 in the largest venues, and were only outdone by the hippodromes in seating capacity. They featured multi-storeyed, arcaded fa√ßades and were elaborately decorated with marble and stucco cladding, statues and reliefs, or even partially made of marble.Bomgardner, 62. As the Empire grew, most of its amphitheatres remained concentrated in the Latin-speaking Western half, while in the East spectacles were mostly staged in other venues such as theatres or stadia.Bomgardner, 192. In the West, amphitheatres were built as part of Romanization efforts by providing a focus for the Imperial cult, by private benefactors, or by the local government of colonies or provincial capitals as an attribute of Roman municipal status. A large number of modest arenas were built in Roman North Africa, where most of the architectural expertise was provided by the Roman military.Bomgardner, 195. The late Empire and the decline of the amphitheatre tradition The Arles Amphitheatre as a fortified settlement, 18th-century engraving Several factors caused the eventual extinction of the tradition of amphitheatre construction. Gladiatorial munera began to disappear from public life during the 3rd century, due to economic pressure, philosophical disapproval and opposition by the increasingly predominant new religion of Christianity, whose adherents considered such games an abomination and a waste of money.Bomgardner, 201‚Äì202. Spectacles involving animals, venationes, survived until the sixth century, but became costlier and rarer. The spread of Christianity also changed the patterns of public beneficence: where a pagan Roman would often have seen himself as a homo civicus, who gave benefits to the public in exchange for status and honor, a Christian would more often be a new type of citizen, a homo interior, who sought to attain a divine reward in heaven and directed his beneficence to alms and charity rather than public works and games.Bomgardner, 207. These changes meant that there were ever fewer uses for amphitheatres, and ever fewer funds to build and maintain them. The last construction of an amphitheatre is recorded in 523 in Pavia under Theoderic.Bomgardner, 221. After the end of venationes, the only remaining purpose of amphitheatres was to be the place of public executions and punishments. After even this purpose dwindled away, many amphitheatres fell into disrepair and were gradually dismantled for building material, razed to make way for newer buildings, or vandalized.Bomgardner, 223. Others were transformed into fortifications or fortified settlements, such as at Leptis Magna, Sabratha, Arles and Pola, and in the 12th century the Frangipani fortified even the Colosseum to help them in Roman power struggles.Bomgardner, 222. Yet others were repurposed as Christian churches, including the arenas at Arles, N√Æmes, Tarragona and Salona; the Colosseum became a Christian shrine in the 18th century. Of the surviving amphitheatres, many are now protected as historic monuments; several are tourist attractions. Important Roman amphitheatres The Colosseum The Flavian Amphitheatre in Rome, more generally known as the Colosseum, is the archetypal and the largest amphitheatre. Built from 72 to 80 AD, it remains as an icon of ancient Rome. Its building and arena dimensions are 188 √ó 156 and 86 √ó 54 meters respectively. It was commissioned by the Emperor Vespasian for the capital city of the ancient Roman Empire from 70‚Äì80 AD but was not completed and opened until 80 AD by his son Titus, as a gift for the people of Rome. Amphitheatre of Pompeii Cavea of the Amphitheatre of Pompeii The Amphitheatre of Pompeii is the oldest surviving Roman amphitheatre. It is located in the Roman city of Pompeii, and was buried by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD, that also buried Pompeii itself and the neighboring town of Herculaneum. It is also the oldest surviving Roman amphitheatre built with stone.  Faleria  The second-largest Roman amphitheatre was the Faleria, built 43 A.D. It was located in Picenum (now Falerone), Italy. Its building dimensions were 178.8 √ó 106.2 meters, and it had an arena shaped like an ellipse. It had twelve entrances, four of which led to the arena and had eight rows of seats divided into three sections. Only the outside wall of the amphitheatre remains and the arena is covered in grass all the way to the podium.  Capua  The third-largest Roman amphitheatre was the Amphitheatre of Capua, with building dimensions of 169.9 √ó 139.6 meters. It was located in the city of Capua (modern Santa Maria Capua Vetere), Italy. It was erected by Augustus in the first century B.C. and could hold up to 60,000 spectators. It is known as the arena that Spartacus fought in in 73 B.C. The theatre was eventually destroyed by the Vandals in their invasion of Rome in 456 AD.  Julia Caesarea  The fourth-largest Roman amphitheatre, the Julia Caesarea, was erected after the time of Julius Caesar. It was built in Mauretania between the times of 25 BC and 23 AD by the Roman-appointed ruler Juba II and his son Ptolemy, which is now considered to be modern day Cherchell, Algeria. Although it has not endured, its building dimensions are known to have been 168 √ó 88 meters with an arena dimension of 72.1 √ó 45.8 meters. The Roman amphitheatre of Italica  Italica  The fifth-largest Roman amphitheatre is found in the province of Sevilla, Spain. Its building dimensions are 156.5 √ó 134 meters and its arena dimensions are 71. 2 √ó 46.2 meters.

For Jordan curves in the plane it is often referred to as the Jordan‚ÄìSchoenflies theorem. Original formulation The original formulation of the Schoenflies problem states that not only does every simple closed curve in the plane separate the plane into two regions, one (the \\"inside\\") bounded and the other (the \\"outside\\") unbounded; but also that these two regions are homeomorphic to the inside and outside of a standard circle in the plane. An alternative statement is that if C \\\\subset \\\\mathbb R^2 is a simple closed curve, then there is a homeomorphism f : \\\\mathbb R^2 \\\\to \\\\mathbb R^2 such that f(C) is the unit circle in the plane. Elementary proofs can be found in , , and . The result can first be proved for polygons when the homeomorphism can be taken to be piecewise linear and the identity map off some compact set; the case of a continuous curve is then deduced by approximating by polygons. The theorem is also an immediate consequence of Carath√©odory's extension theorem for conformal mappings, as discussed in . If the curve is smooth then the homeomorphism can be chosen to be a diffeomorphism. Proofs in this case rely on techniques from differential topology. Although direct proofs are possible (starting for example from the polygonal case), existence of the diffeomorphism can also be deduced by using the smooth Riemann mapping theorem for the interior and exterior of the curve in combination with the Alexander trick for diffeomorphisms of the circle and a result on smooth isotopy from differential topology.See:  Such a theorem is valid only in two dimensions. In three dimensions there are counterexamples such as Alexander's horned sphere. Although they separate space into two regions, those regions are so twisted and knotted that they are not homeomorphic to the inside and outside of a normal sphere. Proofs of the Jordan‚ÄìSchoenflies theorem For smooth or polygonal curves, the Jordan curve theorem can be proved in a straightforward way. Indeed the curve has a tubular neighbourhood, defined in the smooth case by the field of unit normal vectors to the curve or in the polygonal case by points at a distance of less than Œµ from the curve. In a neighbourhood of a differentiable point on the curve, there is a coordinate change in which the curve becomes the diameter of an open disk. Taking a point not on the curve, a straight line aimed at the curve starting at the point will eventually meet the tubular neighborhood; the path can be continued next to the curve until it meets the disk. It will meet it on one side or the other. This proves that the complement of the curve has at most two connected components. On the other hand using the Cauchy integral formula for the winding number, it can be seen that the winding number is constant on connected components of the complement of the curve, is zero near infinity and increases by 1 when crossing the curve. Hence the curve has exactly two components, its interior and the unbounded component. The same argument works for a piecewise differentiable Jordan curve. Polygonal curve Given a simple closed polygonal curve in the plane, the piecewise linear Jordan‚ÄìSchoenflies theorem states that there is a piecewise linear homeomorphism of the plane, with compact support, carrying the polygon onto a triangle and taking the interior and exterior of one onto the interior and exterior of the other.See: The interior of the polygon can be triangulated by small triangles, so that the edges of the polygon form edges of some of the small triangles. Piecewise linear homeomorphisms can be made up from special homeomorphisms obtained by removing a diamond from the plane and taking a piecewise affine map, fixing the edges of the diamond, but moving one diagonal into a V shape. Compositions of homeomorphisms of this kind give rise to piecewise linear homeomorphisms of compact support; they fix the outside of a polygon and act in an affine way on a triangulation of the interior. A simple inductive argument shows that it is always possible to remove a free triangle‚Äîone for which the intersection with the boundary is a connected set made up of one or two edges‚Äîleaving a simple closed Jordan polygon. The special homeomorphisms described above or their inverses provide piecewise linear homeomorphisms which carry the interior of the larger polygon onto the polygon with the free triangle removed. Iterating this process it follows that there is a piecewise linear homeomorphism of compact support carrying the original polygon onto a triangle. Because the homeomorphism is obtained by composing finite many homeomorphisms of the plane of compact support, it follows that the piecewise linear homeomorphism in the statement of the piecewise linear Jordan-Schoenflies theorem has compact support. As a corollary, it follows that any homeomorphism between simple closed polygonal curves extends to a homeomorphism between their interiors. For each polygon there is a homeomorphism of a given triangle onto the closure of their interior. The three homeomorphisms yield a single homeomorphism of the boundary of the triangle. By the Alexander trick this homeomorphism can be extended to a homeomorphism of closure of interior of the triangle. Reversing this process this homeomorphism yields a homeomorphism between the closures of the interiors of the polygonal curves. Continuous curve The Jordan- Schoenflies theorem for continuous curves can be proved using Carath√©odory's theorem on conformal mapping. It states that the Riemann mapping between the interior of a simple Jordan curve and the open unit disk extends continuously to a homeomorphism between their closures, mapping the Jordan curve homeomorphically onto the unit circle.See: To prove the theorem, Carath√©odory's theorem can be applied to the two regions on the Riemann sphere defined by the Jordan curve. This will result in homeomorphisms between their closures and the closed disks z ‚â§ 1 and z ‚â• 1. The homeomorphisms from the Jordan curve to the circle will differ by a homeomorphism of the circle which can be extended to the unit disk (or its complement) by the Alexander trick. Composition with this homeomorphism will yield a pair of homeomorphisms which match on the Jordan curve and therefore define a homeomorphism of the Riemann sphere carrying the Jordan curve onto the unit circle. The continuous case can also be deduced from the polygonal case by approximating the continuous curve by a polygon.See: The Jordan curve theorem is first deduced by this method. The Jordan curve is given by a continuous function on the unit circle. It and the inverse function from its image back to the unit circle are uniformly continuous. So dividing the circle up into small enough intervals, there are points on the curve such that the line segments joining adjacent points lie close to the curve, say by Œµ. Together these line segments form a polygonal curve. If it has self-intersections, these must also create polygonal loops. Erasing these loops, results in a polygonal curve without self-intersections which still lies close to the curve; some its vertices might not lie on the curve, but they all lie within a neighbourhood of the curve. The polygonal curve divides the plane into two regions, one bounded region U and one unbounded region V. Both U and V ‚à™ ‚àû are continuous images of the closed unit disk. Since the original curve is contained within a small neighbourhood of the polygonal curve, the union of the images of slightly smaller concentric open disks entirely misses the original curve only excludes a small neighbourhood of it. One is a bounded open set consisting of points around which the curve has winding number one; the other is an unbounded open set consisting of points of winding number zero. Repeating for a sequence of values of Œµ tending to 0, leads to a union of open path-connected bounded sets of points of winding number one and a union of open path-connected unbounded sets of winding number zero. By construction these two disjoint open path- connected sets fill out the complement of the curve in the plane.See: , Lecture 36 Hexagonal tessellation of the plane: if 2 hexagons meet they must have a common edge A standard brickwork tiling of the plane Given the Jordan curve theorem, the Jordan-Schoenflies theorem can be proved as follows. *The first step is to show that a dense set of points on the curve are accessible from the inside of the curve, i.e. they are at the end of a line segment lying entirely in the interior of the curve. In fact, a given point on the curve is arbitrarily close to some point in the interior and there is a smallest closed disk about that point which intersects the curve only on its boundary; those boundary points are close to the original point on the curve and by construction are accessible. *The second step is to prove that given finitely many accessible points Ai on the curve connected to line segments AiBi in its interior, there are disjoint polygonal curves in the interior with vertices on each of the line segments such that their distance to the original curve is arbitrarily small. This requires tessellations of the plane by uniformly small tiles such that if two tiles meet they have they have a side or a segment of a side in common: examples are the standard hexagonal tessellation; or the standard brickwork tiling by rectangles or squares with common or stretch bonds. It suffices to construct a polygonal path so that its distance to the Jordan curve is arbitrarily small. Orient the tessellation such no side of a tiles is parallel to any AiBi. The size of the tiles can be taken arbitrarily small. Take the union of all the closed tiles containing at least one point of the Jordan curve. Its boundary is made up of disjoint polygonal curves. If the size of the tiles is sufficiently small, the endpoints Bi will lie in the interior of exactly one of the polygonal boundary curves. Its distance to the Jordan curve is less than twice the diameter of the tiles, so is arbitrarily small. *The third step is to prove that any homeomorphism f between the curve and a given triangle can be extended to a homeomorphism between the closures of their interiors. In fact take a sequence Œµ1, Œµ2, Œµ3, ... decreasing to zero. Choose finitely many points Ai on the Jordan curve Œì with successive points less than Œµ1 apart. Make the construction of the second step with tiles of diameter less than Œµ1 and take Ci to be the points on the polygonal curve Œì1 intersecting AiBi. Take the points f(Ai) on the triangle. Fix an origin in the triangle Œî and scale the triangle to get a smaller one Œî1 at a distance less than Œµ1 from the original triangle. Let Di be the points at the intersection of the radius through f(Ai) and the smaller triangle. There is a piecewise linear homeomorphism F1 of the polygonal curve onto the smaller triangle carrying Ci onto Di. By the Jordan-Schoenflies theorem it extends to a homeomorphism F1 between the closure of their interiors. Now carry out the same process for Œµ2 with a new set of points on the Jordan curve. This will produce a second polygonal path Œì2 between Œì1 and Œì. There is likewise a second triangle Œî2 between Œî1 and Œî. The line segments for the accessible points on Œì divide the polygonal region between Œì2 and Œì1 into a union of polygonal regions; similarly for radii for the corresponding points on Œî divides the region between Œî2 and Œî1 into a union of polygonal regions. The homeomorphism F1 can be extended to homeomorphisms between the different polygons, agreeing on common edges (closed intervals on line segments or radii). By the polygonal Jordan-Schoenflies theorem, each of these homeomorphisms extends to the interior of the polygon. Together they yield a homeomorphism F2 of the closure of the interior of Œì2 onto the closure of the interior of Œî2; F2 extends F1. Continuing in this way produces polygonal curves Œìn and triangles Œîn with a homomeomorphism Fn between the closures of their interiors; Fn extends Fn ‚Äì 1. The regions inside the Œìn increase to the region inside Œì; and the triangles Œîn increase to Œî. The homeomorphisms Fn patch together to give a homeomorphism F from the interior of Œì onto the interior of Œî. By construction it has limit f on the boundary curves Œì and Œî. Hence F is the required homeomorphism. *The fourth step is to prove that any homeomorphism between Jordan curves can be extended to a homeomorphism between the closures of their interiors. By the result of the third step, it is sufficient to show that any homeomorphism of the boundary of a triangle extends to a homeomorphism of the closure of its interior. This is a consequence of the Alexander trick. (The Alexander trick also establishes a homeomorphism between the solid triangle and the closed disk: the homeomorphism is just the natural radial extension of the projection of the triangle onto its circumcircle with respect to its circumcentre.) *The final step is to prove that given two Jordan curves there is a homeomorphism of the plane of compact support carrying one curve onto the other. In fact each Jordan curve lies inside the same large circle and in the interior of each large circle there are radii joining two diagonally opposite points to the curve. Each configuration divide the plane into the exterior of the large circle, the interior of the Jordan curve and the region between the two into two bounded regions bounded by Jordan curves (formed of two radii, a semicircle, and one of the halves of the Jordan curve). Take the identity homeomorphism of the large circle; piecewise linear homeomorphisms between the two pairs of radii; and a homeomorphism between the two pairs of halves of the Jordan curves given by a linear reparametrization. The 4 homeomorphisms patch together on the boundary arcs to yield a homeomorphism of the plane given by the identity off the large circle and carrying one Jordan curve onto the other. Smooth curve Proofs in the smooth case depend on finding a diffeomorphism between the interior/exterior of the curve and the closed unit disk (or its complement in the extended plane). This can be solved for example by using the smooth Riemann mapping theorem, for which a number of direct methods are available, for example through the Dirichlet problem on the curve or Bergman kernels.See:  * (Such diffeomorphisms will be holomorphic on the interior and exterior of the curve; more general diffeomorphisms can be constructed more easily using vector fields and flows.) Regarding the smooth curve as lying inside the extended plane or 2-sphere, these analytic methods produce smooth maps up to the boundary between the closure of the interior/exterior of the smooth curve and those of the unit circle. The two identifications of the smooth curve and the unit circle will differ by a diffeomorphism of the unit circle. On the other hand a diffeomorphism of the unit circle can be extended to a diffeomorphism of the unit disk by the Alexander extension: :\\\\displaystyle{F(r e^{i\\\\theta})= r \\\\exp [i\\\\psi(r)g(\\\\theta) + i(1-\\\\psi(r))\\\\theta],} where is a smooth function with values in [0,1], equal to 0 near 0 and 1 near 1, and , with . Composing one of the diffeomorphisms with the Alexander extension allows the two diffeomorphisms to be patched together to give a homeomorphism of the 2-sphere which restricts to a diffeomorphism on the closed unit disk and the closures of its complement which it carries onto the interior and exterior of the original smooth curve. By the isotopy theorem in differential topology,See: *, Theorem 1.9 *, Theorem 6.4.3 the homeomorphism can be adjusted to a diffeomorphism on the whole 2-sphere without changing it on the unit circle. This diffeomorphism then provides the smooth solution to the Schoenflies problem. The Jordan-Schoenflies theorem can be deduced using differential topology. In fact it is an immediate consequence of the classification up to diffeomorphism of smooth oriented 2-manifolds with boundary, as described in . Indeed the smooth curve divides the 2-sphere into two parts. By the classification each is diffeomorphic to the unit disk and‚Äîtaking into account the isotopy theorem‚Äîthey are glued together by a diffeomorphism of the boundary. By the Alexander trick, such a diffeomorphism extends to the disk itself. Thus there is a diffeomorphism of the 2-sphere carrying the smooth curve onto the unit circle. On the other hand the diffeomorphism can also be constructed directly using the Jordan-Schoenflies theorem for polygons and elementary methods from differential topology, namely flows defined by vector fields.See:  When the Jordan curve is smooth (parametrized by arc length) the unit normal vectors give a non-vanishing vector field X0 in a tubular neighbourhood U0 of the curve. Take a polygonal curve in the interior of the curve close to the boundary and transverse to the curve (at the vertices the vector field should be strictly within the angle formed by the edges). By the piecewise linear Jordan‚ÄìSchoenflies theorem, there is a piecewise linear homeomorphism, affine on an appropriate triangulation of the interior of the polygon, taking the polygon onto a triangle. Take an interior point P in one of the small triangles of the triangulation. It corresponds to a point Q in the image triangle. There is a radial vector field on the image triangle, formed of straight lines pointing towards Q. This gives a series of lines in the small triangles making up the polygon. Each defines a vector field Xi on a neighbourhood Ui of the closure of the triangle. Each vector field is transverse to the sides, provided that Q is chosen in \\"general position\\" so that it is not collinear with any of the finitely many edges in the triangulation. Translating if necessary, it can be assumed that P and Q are at the origin 0. On the triangle containing P the vector field can be taken to be the standard radial vector field. Similarly the same procedure can be applied to the outside of the smooth curve, after applying M√∂bius transformation to map it into the finite part of the plane and ‚àû to 0. In this case the neighbourhoods Ui of the triangles have negative indices. Take the vector fields Xi with a negative sign, pointing away from the point at infinity. Together U0 and the Ui's with i ‚â† 0 form an open cover of the 2-sphere. Take a smooth partition of unity œài subordinate to the cover Ui and set :\\\\displaystyle{X=\\\\sum \\\\psi_i\\\\cdot X_i.} X is a smooth vector field on the two sphere vanishing only at 0 and ‚àû. It has index 1 at 0 and -1 at ‚àû. Near 0 the vector field equals the radial vector field pointing towards 0. If Œ±t is the smooth flow defined by X, the point 0 is an attracting point and ‚àû a repelling point. As t tends to +‚àû, the flow send points to 0; while as t tends to ‚Äì‚àû points are sent to ‚àû. Replacing X by f‚ãÖX with f a smooth positive function, changes the parametrization of the integral curves of X, but not the integral curves themselves. For an appropriate choice of f equal to 1 outside a small annulus near 0, the integral curves starting at points of the smooth curve will all reach smaller circle bounding the annulus at the same time s. The diffeomorphism Œ±s therefore carries the smooth curve onto this small circle. A scaling transformation, fixing 0 and ‚àû, then carries the small circle onto the unit circle. Composing these diffeomorphisms gives a diffeomorphism carrying the smooth curve onto the unit circle. Generalizations There does exist a higher-dimensional generalization due to and independently with , which is also called the generalized Schoenflies theorem. It states that, if an (n ‚àí 1)-dimensional sphere S is embedded into the n-dimensional sphere Sn in a locally flat way (that is, the embedding extends to that of a thickened sphere), then the pair (Sn, S) is homeomorphic to the pair (Sn, Sn‚àí1), where Sn‚àí1 is the equator of the n-sphere. Brown and Mazur received the Veblen Prize for their contributions. The Schoenflies problem can be posed in categories other than the topologically locally flat category, i.e. does a smoothly (piecewise-linearly) embedded (n ‚àí 1)-sphere in the n-sphere bound a smooth (piecewise-linear) n-ball? For n = 4, the problem is still open for both categories. See Mazur manifold. For n ‚â• 5 the question has an affirmative answer, and follows from the h-cobordism theorem.

Media development plays a role in democracy and effective democratic discourse through supporting free and independent media. Support for Media Development International donors and other organizations often include support for media development as part of their overall support to international economic and democratic development. Typical efforts to develop independent media development include: journalist training and education; support for and advice on improving the legal and business environment for media; efforts to improve the sustainability of existing outlets; media literacy training; digital media training and integration; infrastructure development; and monitoring and evaluation efforts. Indicators for Media Development UNESCO Media Development Indicators UNESCO developed Media Development Indicators in 2008 as a framework for international media development. Indicators are within five categories: *A system of regulation conducive to freedom of expression, pluralism and diversity of the media *Plurality and diversity of media, a level economic playing field and transparency of ownership *Media as a platform for democratic discourse *Professional capacity building and supporting institutions that underpins freedom of expression, pluralism and diversity *Infrastructural capacity is sufficient to support independent and pluralistic media The indicators were used for a pilot international survey in 2011 in which 28 countries participated, focused on regulation and supply.

The focus of LEGS technology is its M1 Knee, a polycentric knee joint that meets international standards and can be manufactured locally for as little as $15 USD.LeTourneau stakes claim on prosthetic invention, Isaac, Jimmy, November 14, 2009 History Founded in 2004, LEGS is a multidisciplinary technology development program operated by LeTourneau University (LETU) in Longview, Texas. The program builds on synergies between the undergraduate educational programs of the university and faculty research interests to create a focused program of product development. Resident engineering expertise in biomechanics, materials, manufacturing and mechanical systems is combined with established prosthetics theory and practice. As a result, LEGS‚Äô engineers design and produce new and innovative prosthetic component systems, which are highly functional and durable at minimum expense. The genesis of the LEGS Program can be traced back to when its executive director, LeTourneau University biomedical engineering professor Dr. Roger Gonzalez, was a young boy living in El Paso, Texas. During a family trip across the border to poverty-stricken Juarez, Mexico, he saw helpless, crippled children and adult amputees, unable to walk or work, begging for money along the roadsides. He remembers his father saying, ‚ÄúThere, but for the grace of God, go you and I.‚Äù That experience had a profound impact on his young heart. In 2004, Dr. Gonzalez launched a senior biomedical engineering design project known as LeTourneau Engineering Global Solutions (LEGS). The challenge was to design and build a low-cost above-the-knee (AK) prosthetic that was durable, maintenance-free and could be easily manufactured in developing countries. ‚ÄúOur goal was to take advanced, first world technology and reverse-engineer the expense out of it, to produce a low-cost prosthetic that would work well in the rough, uneven terrain of developing nations.\\" By combining in-house engineering expertise with modern assessment tools, the LEGS teams developed initial prototypes for both a prosthetic knee and foot. These prototypes were extensively tested in LETU‚Äôs labs to verify their basic performance. The teams then worked with local amputees to assess how the prototype designs would work on an actual prosthetic limb. Gait analysis sessions were undertaken using a sophisticated motion camera systems. The students assessed the patient‚Äôs stride length, cadence and energy consumption. The results of these tests were extremely positive and indicated that the team was ready for the next important step‚Äì‚Äìvalidating their design in the harsh conditions of the developing world. In the summer of 2005, the first LEGS prosthetic prototypes were manufactured and tested at CURE International‚Äôs Bethany Crippled Children‚Äôs Center in Kijabe, Kenya. Dr. Gonzalez and four senior engineering students spent three weeks providing about a dozen disabled Kenyans, mostly children, with prosthetic legs. They also provided the raw materials to produce additional legs.LeTourneau University Engineering Students Aid Disabled Kenyans, The Medical News, May 23, 2005 In many poor developing countries, the standard lower limb prosthetic is a ‚Äúpeg leg‚Äù that requires the amputee to swing the leg around from the hip, causing abnormal gait and strained muscular development that leads to long term orthopedic problems and pain. ‚ÄúOur prosthetic knee design leg is far more functional because it simulates natural movement, rotating freely during the leg swing and then automatically locking when they put weight on it,‚Äù says Dr. Gonzalez. ‚ÄúThe knee is also designed to meet international performance standards as set forth by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).‚Äù Overview of international work Currently, LEGS technology is present in Bangladesh, Kenya, Senegal, and Sierra Leone in over a dozen local clinics within these countries. Each of these countries has international NGO partners who host LEGS when they are on the ground. Currently, LEGS does not fit patients; rather it teaches local clinicians how to manufacture the LEGS M1 knee using locally obtainable materials. LEGS evaluates sites that can best benefit from its technology, and then holds Demonstration Clinics and Technology Transfer Workshops to teach the manufacturing and technology of the LEGS knee most effectively. Kenya In the African Great Lakes, the LEGS team has had a relationship with AIC-Cure International in Kijabe, Kenya for five years.http://www.helpcurenow.org/site/pp.aspx?c=nvI1IeNYJyE&b;=3474797/ AIC- Cure International Children‚Äôs Hospital fits both children and adults in need of above-knee prosthetic devices, and has done so since 1998. The LEGS team has fitted dozens of patients at AIC-Cure with the LEGS knee, and has begun to teach local clinicians how to manufacture the LEGS knee as the technology has improved. During the time spent in Kenya this past summer, the team held a Technology Demonstration. This is different from a workshop in that the team only presented the LEGS technology package, as the local clinics did not have a chance to produce their own knees. This approach was due in part to the limited amount of time the team had available to spend in Kenya, as well as the large number of people attending the demonstration. 15 different people from seven different entities related to prosthetics attended the demonstration. The attendees were from other parts of Kenya, as well as other countries in the African Great Lakes. Many were interested in implementing LEGS technology in their clinics, and the LEGS team hopes to visit other clinics on return visits to Kenya. Bangladesh A Technology Transfer Workshop was held in Savar, Bangladesh in the summer of 2009. The LEGS team performed the workshop at the Center for the Rehabilitation of the Paralyzed (CRP) and was hosted by the Memorial Christian Hospital of Bangladesh (MCH).http://www.aobbangladesh.org/node/12/ The LEGS team has had a relationship with MCH for four years. MCH personnel have worked towards improving the lives of amputees in rural Bangladesh for decades. The CRP hosted the workshops for several days in July 2009, and there were 15 different individuals from four different entities related to prosthetics. Besides demonstrating the manufacturing of a LEGS knee for local participants, the LEGS team did minor repairs and outcomes testing on ten individuals who had been previously fitted with the LEGS Knee. Most of the repairs were minimal which serves as a testament to the durability of the knee, since many of these patients have been wearing the LEGS knee for several years. In addition, the patients continued to express great satisfaction with their prostheses. Senegal The LEGS team conducted its first Technology Transfer Workshop (TTW) in Senegal in the summer of 2009. The goal of this workshop was to introduce the LEGS knee as another prosthetic option, and to teach local clinicians in the manufacturing of the LEGS knee, which would be used as part of a complete prosthetic limb for amputees. The LEGS team was hosted in Senegal by Dr. Amadou Koura Ndao, Director of the Centre National d‚ÄôAppareillage Orthopedie in Senegal. The center has operated for many years and has been committed to providing the highest possible service to the disabled of Senegal. The TTW was attended by officials from four different organizations related to prosthetics. Some were from other parts of Senegal, and some were from different countries in West Africa, all of whom were very impressed by the LEGS technology. In fact, the Senegalese Ministry of Health was so impressed with the Workshop put on by the LEGS team that officials have offered to collaborate with clinics in Senegal to provide them with the Delrin plastic necessary for producing the LEGS knee, lowering the costs of production even further. The LEGS team plans to return to Senegal next summer to follow up with the patients that it fitted this past summer, and to expand its available technology around the region.Group hopes prosthetics foster independence in Sierra Leone , Landers, Jim, July 6, 2008 Sierra Leone The LEGS team was active in Sierra Leone from 2007-2008. Their first trip in January 2007 was to evaluate the potential for having Sierra Leone as a hub. During this time, [Mercy Ships-New Steps] became LEGS‚Äô host during their trips to Sierra Leone. This was followed by a trip in 2008 where LEGS held a TTW in the National Center for Rehabilitation in Freeown. The TTW was attended by NGO‚Äôs such as Handicap International (HI) and the Prosthetic Outreach Foundation (POF). After Mercy Ships-New Steps pulled out of Sierra Leone, the LEGS team lost its host, and was unable to return. However, local professionals working for POF are still manufacturing the LEGS M1 Knee, proving that LEGS technology is a viable option for a locally obtainable prosthetic solution. Materials validation Prosthetic components developed through LEGS will adhere to the same rigorous testing standards as their first-world counterparts, and be tested in accordance with the requirements of ISO 10328, which includes both static and fatigue loading. Additional materials testing will be undertaken to fully characterize materials in accordance with relevant ISO and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. Work will include the development of permissible material property limits and dimensional adaptation guidelines, which would facilitate substitutions of specified materials not accessible in a given country. A new type of custom foot tester is also currently under development by LEGS. It has been created to improve the ability of the prosthetics community to assess long-term foot performance under realistic service conditions in the laboratory. No tester like this currently exists, even in the developed world. The new prototype tester was constructed in 2007 and currently awaits programming and validation. Once this tester is operational it will be used extensively in the development of a new foot design. Laboratory-based patient outcomes evaluation The LEGS Outcomes and Rehabilitation Research team is responsible for evaluating outcomes for patients using LEGS prosthetic technology and for developing guidelines for prosthetists and therapists to use in the rehabilitation of patients using the technology. This includes the development of programs for both laboratory evaluations here in the U.S. as well as field evaluations at LEGS overseas sites. Laboratory evaluations of patient outcomes are conducted in two ways: * Quantitative assessments using motion-capture camera systems, a multi-sensor walking mat and respirometry- based physiological assessments. * Qualitative evaluations focusing on patient feedback and established evaluation questionnaires. All of the laboratory evaluations involve volunteer amputees who are fitted with a LEGS prosthesis and a comparative U.S. commercial prosthesis by their personal prosthetist. All U.S. laboratory assessments are conducted on the campus of LeTourneau University. International patient outcomes have confirmed that the LEGS knee meets international standards, and maintains its functionality, even after several years of use in the field.

In 1985, after retiring from Michigan, he moved to Cambridge, where he was an Affiliated Lecturer in the Faculty of Classics. He served as Keeper of Coins and Medals at the Fitzwilliam Museum from 1988 to 1991 and from 2008 until his death held the post of Honorary Keeper of Ancient Coins. Contributions outside numismatics Buttrey was the founder and publisher of Pevensey Press, a specialty book company principally devoted to publishing lavishly photographed books of English university towns and countryside. His company employed a photographer and several writers. More than 20 titles were produced between 1980 and 1995.ISBNDB.com listing of Pevensey Press titles Buttrey worked with the University of Michigan Television Center from 1966 to 1980. He wrote and recorded TV shows on the Iliad (10 half-hour shows) and the Odyssey (15 half- hour shows), Herodotus, Suetonius and the Twelve Caesars, among others and in areas as diverse as race relations and on the art of drawing. These shows were carried on over 75 TV stations at their peak. Numismatic work Coins of Ancient Greece and Rome Buttrey spent many years active in research on coins of the ancient Mediterranean. He and his collaborators documented the coinage of Sardis, in modern-day Turkey (and formerly under the control of the Persian and Roman Empires), and, as part of a long-term Princeton University project, he also investigated the coinage at Morgantina, in modern-day Sicily. He was involved in the publication of the numismatic finds from numerous excavations in Britain, Italy (Cosa, Rome Palatine, Rome Forum), Libya (Apollonia, Cyrene, Euesperides), and Israel. Coins of Mexico It was as a child at the Peacock Military Academy in San Antonio, Texas that Buttrey first encountered, and became interested in, the coins of Mexico. Although as an adult his primary professional pursuits as a scholar were elsewhere, he continued his interest in Mexican coins into adulthood as well. His \\"Guidebook of Mexican Coins, 1822 to Date\\" (1969), together with subsequent editions (up to the 6th Edition in 1992, this one with first author Clyde Hubbard) is considered the seminal work on the subject. Fake Mexican and Western American gold bars Although the bulk of Buttrey's academic output concerned coins of antiquity, Buttrey was directly involved in a controversy regarding Western American gold bars that he described as counterfeit. This followed earlier, apparently uncontroversial, work in which he was able to identify certain Mexican gold bars as counterfeit, primarily by cataloguing anachronistic assayer markings. That earlier work was capped by Buttrey's 1973 talk, \\"False Mexican Colonial Gold Bars\\" at the International Numismatic Congress. In 1984, the American Numismatic Society passed a resolution supporting Buttrey's assertions. \\"Gold Bars, Glamorous Stories And a Battle Over Authenticity,\\" Dinitia Smith, New York Times, March 3, 2001 The dispute regarding the Western American bars was quite possibly the only time a dispute among academic numismatists reached the pages of major newspapers, including The New York Times. Buttrey's claims about the authenticity of the western bars were first detailed in a 1996 talk at the ANS. They were based in part on mint and assay markings that he said were incongruous or inconsistent. He also noted that many of the bars in question had no provenance at all, never appearing in catalogues or other materials from the time that the bars were allegedly produced through the 1950s. Buttrey named as perpetrators of the fraud the coin dealer John J. Ford Jr., who marketed many of his creations through Stack's LLC, a New York coin dealer. Ford and Stack's maintained that all the bars in question were genuine; Ford described Buttrey as a \\"crackpot.\\" There is no question that Ford and Stack's sold a number of the disputed gold bars to collector and philanthropist Josiah K. Lilly, Jr.. Lilly's extensive collection of gold and coins, including the disputed bars, was donated to the Smithsonian Institution after his death in 1966 in exchange for a multimillion-dollar tax break for his estate. In 1999, Michael Hodder, a consultant for Stack's, attempted to rebut the claims that Buttrey laid out in his 1996 ANS lecture. In August of that year, Buttrey and Hodder spoke jointly during an American Numismatic Association convention in Chicago, in an encounter referred to by numismatists as \\"The Great Debate\\". Coin World magazine wrote later that it \\"was one of the most heavily attended numismatic events at an ANA convention\\". In April 2000, Ford, together with Harvey Stack of Stack's, sued Buttrey in a $5 million action for defamation in the U.S. Federal District Court in New York. That suit was eventually dismissed. Buttrey provided evidence of what he called fraud to the office of the Attorney General of New York State, but no criminal charges were ever filed against Ford or Stack's. Although elements of the Lilly Collection continue to be on display at the Smithsonian, the gold bars in question have been removed.

He previously played in MLB for the Texas Rangers and Minnesota Twins. Listed at and , P√©rez throws and bats left-handed. Professional career Texas Rangers P√©rez with Texas in 2012 The Texas Rangers signed P√©rez in 2007 for $580,000 as an undrafted free agent. While only making 15 short starts in 62 innings at Rookie-level Spokane, P√©rez went 1-2 with a 3.65 earned run average (ERA). Baseball America ranked P√©rez as the #17 baseball prospect in their top 100 for 2010. On June 26, 2012, P√©rez was called up by the Rangers. The next day he made his first major league appearance against the Detroit Tigers. He gave up 2 hits and 4 runs while striking out one over two-thirds of an inning. On June 30, P√©rez made his first major league start, pitching 5 and a third innings and striking out five while only giving up two runs in a 7‚Äì2 win over the Oakland A's. On August 1, P√©rez was optioned to Triple-A Round Rock to make room for pitcher Ryan Dempster. P√©rez went into 2013 spring training competing for the fifth spot in the Rangers rotation (which eventually went to Nick Tepesch), but on March 3 in a start against the Mariners, he broke his pitching forearm when it was hit by a line drive by Brad Miller. After making 4 rehab starts (2 with Frisco, 2 with Round Rock), P√©rez was recalled to make a start on May 27 in a doubleheader against the Diamondbacks. In his season debut, he went 5.1 innings, giving up 4 runs (3 earned) on 9 hits with 2 strikeouts. After the game, he was optioned to Round Rock. After 4 starts at Round Rock, he was recalled on June 22 to replace Josh Lindblom in the rotation. P√©rez threw his first complete game on August 11 against the Astros. In 20 starts with the Rangers, P√©rez went 10‚Äì6 with a 3.62 ERA, striking out 84 in innings. On November 7, 2013, P√©rez signed a four-year, $12.5 million contract with the Rangers that holds three club options, keeping him under team control through 2020. He received a $1 million signing bonus, and was to earn $750,000 in 2014, $1 million in 2015, $2.9 million in 2016, and $4.4 million in 2017. The 2018 option was worth $6 million and had a $2.45 million buyout. The 2019 option was worth $7.5 million and had a $750,000 buyout. The 2020 option is worth $9 million and has a $750,000 buyout. On April 23, 2014, P√©rez threw nine shutout innings against the Oakland A's to secure his second consecutive (and career) complete game shutout. After several ineffective starts following the shutouts, P√©rez was placed on the disabled list due to inflammation in his pitching elbow. On May 19, 2014, P√©rez underwent Tommy John surgery to repair a partially torn UCL in the aforementioned elbow, which kept him out of action for the remainder of 2014. P√©rez began the 2015 season on the 60-day disabled list to continue recovery from Tommy John surgery. P√©rez had his first major league hit on July 15, 2016, against Chicago Cubs' pitcher Kyle Hendricks. He hit a single to Kris Bryant. He had been hitless his first nine at bats. In 2016 he was 10‚Äì11 and had the fewest strikeouts per 9 innings in the major leagues (4.67). He had more batters reach base against him on errors, 16, than any other pitcher in the major leagues. In 2017, P√©rez was 13‚Äì12 with a 4.32 ERA, and had the highest WHIP among major league pitchers (1.48). He also had the highest line drive percentage allowed (24.8%) of all major league pitchers. On April 30, 2018, P√©rez was placed on the disabled list with discomfort in his right elbow. He was activated on July 14, replacing Alex Claudio, who was placed on the disabled list. In 2018, he was 2‚Äì7 with a 6.22 ERA. Minnesota Twins On January 30, 2019, P√©rez signed a one-year contract with the Minnesota Twins. He was expected to compete for the fifth spot in the starting rotation. During the 2019 season, he made 32 appearances with 29 starts, with a WHIP of 1.52, the highest in the major leagues. He compiled a 10‚Äì7 record in innings pitched. After the season, he became a free agent. Boston Red Sox On December 19, 2019, P√©rez signed a one-year contract with the Boston Red Sox; the contract also included a team option for the 2021 season. Overall with the 2020 Red Sox, P√©rez appeared in 12 games (all starts), compiling a 3‚Äì5 record with 4.50 ERA and 46 strikeouts in 62 innings pitched. He led the AL in walks per nine innings pitched, with 4.1, and in lowest strikeout/walk ratio, at 1.64. Pitching style P√©rez features a four-seam fastball that is regularly clocked at , a sharp breaking curveball, and a change-up. His velocity is not that of a power pitcher, but his pitches have good movement. In 2007, when he was first signed by the Rangers, he was likened to be a cross between Johan Santana and Greg Maddux.

Dated to the 11th century, the temple was dedicated to Xuan Wu, or Tr·∫•n V≈© in Vietnamese, one of the principal deities in Taoism. As one of the Four Sacred Temples of the capital, Quan Th√°nh Temple is located near West Lake in a ward of the same name: Qu√°n Th√°nh Ward; and is one of the leading tourist attractions in Hanoi. The temple's name means Place (alternatively shop/restaurant) of the Gods. The name of the long street running by the temple is also called 'Qu√°n Th√°nh' street. History Tr·∫•n V≈© bronze statue in main shrine of the temple. Legend has it that Qu√°n Th√°nh Temple was established during the reign of Emperor L√Ω Th√°i T·ªï (reigned 1010‚Äì1028) and was dedicated to Tr·∫•n V≈©, Deity of the North in Taoism, whose symbols of power are the serpent and turtle (see section on Animal Symbolism below). It is one of the Four Sacred Temples that were built in four directions to protect the capital from malevolent spirits. Qu√°n Th√°nh protects from the North, while the other three temples protect from the other directions: B·∫°ch M√£ from the East, Kim Li√™m from the South, and Th·∫ßn Linh Lang from the West. In Hanoi, there is also a second Tr·∫•n V≈© Temple in the Gia L√¢m District. Though smaller than Qu√°n Th√°nh Temple, this smaller temple is also dedicated to Tr·∫•n V≈© with a 9-tonne statue of the deity. Nowadays, after many geographical changes to the city layout, Qu√°n Th√°nh Temple is located on the corner of Qu√°n Th√°nh Street and Thanh Nien Street, facing West Lake. It is a short walk from Tr√∫c B·∫°ch Lake where pilot (and future United States senator) John McCain was shot down in October 1967. Architecture During its long history, Qu√°n Th√°nh Temple has been renovated several times, most recently in 1893 when the principal gate and the shrine were redone, so the architecture is a mixture of the many different styles of the imperial era. The main features of Qu√°n Th√°nh Temple are a large yard shaded by a giant banyan tree and a shrine that contains the famous bronze statue of Tr·∫•n V≈©. In 1677 during the reign of King L√™ Huy T√¥ng, artisans from the nearby village of Ng≈© X√£ offered Qu√°n Th√°nh Temple a very large statue of Tr·∫•n V≈© in black bronze, which remains today. This statue is measured in height, weighs around and depicts Tr·∫•n V≈© as a deity with his two symbolic animals, the serpent and the turtle. Considered a masterpiece of Vietnamese bronze casting and sculpture, it is the second biggest bronze statue in Vietnam. This artwork is evidence of the advanced technical standard of bronze casting and sculpture of Vietnamese artisans in the 17th century. Cast at the same time as Tr·∫•n V≈©'s statue was a bronze bell. Those were creations of a master craftsman named Tr√πm Tr·ªçng, who had his own statue in Quan Thanh Temple placed alongside the Tr·∫•n V≈© statue. Beside the statues of Tran Vu and Trum Trong, the main shrine also has a valuable collection of ancient texts such as poems or duilians which date from the 17th and 18th century. After each restoration, a stele was often kept in the temple for the record; the oldest one dated from 1677 while the latest was made by viceroy Ho√†ng Cao Kh·∫£i in 1894 during the reign of Th√†nh Th√°i Emperor during the French colonial era. The temple currently has writing in ancient Chinese, due to Chinese rule over Vietnam for around a thousand years. During the 17th century, French missionaries began to write the Vietnamese language using Latin symbols. In the early 20th century, Vietnam officially adopted the Latin alphabet for their writing. Nowadays only a few Vietnamese can read and understand the ancient Chinese symbols. Animal Symbolism In most Vietnamese temples, there is a great deal of animal symbolism, and Qu√°n Th√°nh is no exception. The most famous example of animal symbolism is the image of the serpent and the turtle. The serpent represents wealth and the turtle represents protection. In a traditional Vietnamese fairy tale, the turtle had a powerful sword that made its way to L√™ Th√°i T·ªï and allowed the Vietnamese win the war against the Chinese. Another important animal is the crane, which is included in a famous Vietnamese story with the turtle. The story says that there once was a drought and the turtle needed water to stay alive. The crane saw he was in trouble, and flew him to the nearest water source. Later there was a flood and the crane had no place to land, so the turtle let the crane stand on his back until the flood was over. This story shows symbiosis, or friendship. This is shown by how the two animals helped each other when they were in trouble. Activities In the courtyard there is a brick oven where people burn fake money. The money is typically burned during T·∫øt (Lunar New Year). This is because it is believed that the money and other items will be sent to their ancestors. According to a guide of the temple, the origin of this tradition is still unknown. By tradition, Hanoians often come to Qu√°n Th√°nh Temple on the occasion of T·∫øt or the first and fifteenth of each lunar month (new and full moon respectively) to worship and pray for health, luck and happiness. Taoism has been mixed with other Vietnamese religions since this temple was built, so the people that come to pray are not fully Taoist. Currently two monks live at the temple.

Designed as a basic trainer, the F.K.56 had two seats in tandem for the instructor and pupil under a fully enclosed canopy. The first prototype flew on 30 June 1938 and had fixed conventional landing gear and an inverted gull wing. The second prototype had retractable landing gear while a third prototype was fitted with a straight wing and dual controls. Ten aircraft were ordered by the Netherlands Army based on the design of the third prototype. These ten, including the re-worked first and third prototypes, were all delivered before the German invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940. Earlier in February 1940 the Belgians had ordered twenty F.K.56 basic trainers and seven had been delivered before the rest were destroyed in an air raid on the Waalhaven factory.

He previously played for the Chicago Cubs, New York Yankees and Miami Marlins. Castro is a four-time MLB All-Star and holds the record for most runs batted in in an MLB debut. In 2011, he led the National League in hits, becoming the youngest player to do so. Professional career Minor leagues In 2009, Castro was named to the Florida State League All-Star team, and won MVP honors, going 4-for-4 with an inside-the-park home run in the game. He was also named All-Star Futures Game for the World Team. After the season, Castro was named the best prospect in Chicago's organization by Baseball America. Chicago Cubs in 2010 Chicago Cubs =2010= Castro was called up to the majors on May 7, 2010, from the Tennessee Smokies, the Cubs Double-A affiliate. He became the first major league player born in the 1990s. In his first major league at-bat, he hit a home run off of Homer Bailey of the Cincinnati Reds. He became the sixth player in Cubs history and 106th player overall to do so. Later in the game he hit a triple with the bases loaded, setting the record for most runs batted in (RBIs) in a major league debut with six. He finished the game two for five in the Cubs' 14 to 7 win. Castro finished the season with a .300/.347/.408 line with three home runs and 41 RBIs in 463 at-bats over 125 games. Despite his significant offensive contribution, Castro led the team and was second in the National League in errors with 27. On October 19, 2010, Castro was named the shortstop on Baseball America's 2010 All-Rookie Team. He was also named the shortstop on the 2010 Topps Major League Rookie All-Star Team. He finished tied for fifth in Rookie of the Year voting. =2011: All-Star season= 2011 was Castro's first full season as an MLB player, and also marked his first All-Star Game selection, as he was one of three shortstops selected to the National League All-Star team. Castro was the youngest Chicago Cub player to make an All-Star team. Castro stole two bases in the All-Star Game despite having only one plate appearance, tying him for the most stolen bases in a single All-Star Game. The same day, Castro received Edward Jones Player of the Month Award honors. Castro was the National League Player of the Week twice during the 2011 season. On September 23, 2011, Castro got his 200th base hit of the season, at Busch Stadium against the rival St. Louis Cardinals, and was the youngest member of the Cubs to ever do so. Castro was the youngest player to ever lead the National League in hits, achieving the feat with his 207th hit of the season on September 28, 2011. Castro's game jersey was sent to the Hall of Fame, in a similar manner to his MLB debut's game jersey. His line for the 2011 season was .307/.341/.432, and it was the first season in which he hit double digit home runs (10). Overall, Castro finished the 2011 season with a .307 batting average, 10 home runs and 66 RBI. His 207 base hits and 674 at- bats both led the National League. On defense, he led all major league shortstops in errors, with 29. He also had the lowest fielding percentage (.961). =2012: All-Star season= Castro was selected to the National League All-Star team along with teammate Bryan LaHair.

He hit 10 home runs and had 44 RBIs, nine steals, and 2 triples while playing in 161 games. =2014: All-Star season= Chicago Cubs in 2014 After a disappointing 2013, Castro was selected to appear in his third All-Star game along with teammate Anthony Rizzo in 2014. Unfortunately, Castro's All-Star year came to an early end when he was injured on September 2 when he awkwardly slid into home plate in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers. He did not return for the balance of the year and finished with a strong batting average of .292 with 14 home runs, 65 RBI's, 4 stolen bases, 33 doubles and 1 triple in 528 at bats. Castro was the top hitting shortstop (for average) in the National League ahead of the Dodgers' Hanley Ram√≠rez. On defense, he had only 15 errors and a fielding percentage of .973. =2015= During a game on April 20, 2015 against the Pirates in Pittsburgh, Castro hit a ball that went foul behind home plate and struck a fan in her head. The game was delayed for 23 minutes until the fan was escorted on a stretcher and hospitalized due to a concussion. Come the trade deadline, there was much speculation of a trade involving Castro. Potential deals might have involved him going to the Phillies or the Padres. Amid the speculation, Castro was told by manager Joe Maddon that he would not be traded. In August, Castro was benched by Cubs manager Joe Maddon due to poor performance, including a career low .236 batting average. With rookie Addison Russell taking over as the everyday shortstop, Castro made the switch to second base on August 12. On September 18, in an important game against the division leading Cardinals, Castro hit two home runs and matched his career high with six RBIs to lead the Cubs to an 8-3 win. New York Yankees Starlin Castro with the New York Yankees on September 5, 2017 On December 8, 2015, Castro was traded to the New York Yankees in exchange for pitcher Adam Warren and a player to be named later.

Miami Marlins Castro with the Marlins in 2018 On December 11, 2017, Castro was traded to the Miami Marlins (along with Jorge Guzm√°n and Jos√© Devers) in exchange for outfielder Giancarlo Stanton and cash considerations. He finished his first season with the Marlins with a .278 batting average and 12 home runs and 54 RBI. Castro entered 2019 as a prominent trade candidate for the Marlins, but he struggled offensively throughout the first half of the season and did not attract much interest prior to the July 31 trade deadline. He transitioned from second base to third base in early August when the team promoted prospect Isan D√≠az from the minor leagues. Castro's performance improved late in the season and he finished with a .270 batting average and set new career highs with 22 home runs and 86 RBI. He was one of only five MLB players in 2019 to play the full 162-game schedule. On October 31, 2019, the Marlins declined their 2020 option on him and made him a free agent.https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2019/10/marlins-to- decline-club-option-on-starlin-castro.html Washington Nationals The Washington Nationals signed Castro to a two-year contract reportedly valued at $12 million on January 7, 2020.https://www.mlb.com/nationals/news/nationals- deal-with-starlin-castro On July 23, 2020, Castro was the starting second baseman, making his Nationals debut on Opening Day against the New York Yankees.

He played a notable role in the Caucasian theatre of the Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì29) in which he failed to recapture Akhaltsikhe for the Ottomans, but checked Russian attempts to invade Adjara. Subsequently, Ahmed abandoned his earlier clandestine diplomacy with the Russians and served loyally to the Ottoman government as a commander in Kars and Erzurum. He died fighting the Kurdish insurgents in 1836.  Early career  Ahmed Bey was a son of Selim Bey of Adjara, a derebey (\\"the lord of the valleys\\") of Upper Adjara, who was put to death, in 1815, for having opposed the Ottoman control of the Muslim Georgian fiefdoms. After this, Ahmed Bey and his brother Abdi Bey fled to their in-laws in the neighboring Georgian principality of Guria, a subject of the Russian Empire. In 1818, once the Ottoman punitive force left Adjara, Ahmed returned to his native village of Nigazeuli, expanded his family's powerbase in Adjara and established himself at Khulo, where he built a castle on the ruins of an old Christian monastery. He also attempted to extend his influence to Guria, where he supported anti-Russian opposition and threatened Russian loyalists. On 9 April 1819, Ahmed Bey made a surprise raid into Guria, burned down the village of Askana, and carried off many prisoners. On his way back, already in Adjara, the Gurians overtook him and defeated in a pitched battle, freeing their countrymen. At least 34 Adjarians, including an agha, were killed; Ahmed's cousin, two Turkish officials, 12 standard-bearers, and 79 others were taken captive. An incident induced the Russian troops to more energetically engage in the frontier districts, leading to a series of reprisal raids into the Muslim settlements.  Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì29)  The Khimshiashvili family's rule in Adjara was largely autonomous of the central Ottoman government, which, facing a new war with Russia in 1828, was in urgent need of local irregulars to reinforce its own weak forces in the southwest Caucasus and had to rely on the services of local beys. On the other hand, the Russian commander-in-chief Count Paskevich tried, through General Bebutov, to buy Ahmed's loyalty by the promise of security of his estates, the rank of a Russian general, an Imperial order, and a state pension. Eventually, Ahmed was won over by the Ottomans by granting him the right to rule Akhaltsikh as a pasha if he would recapture that city from the Russians. In February 1829, Ahmed, at the head of some 20,000 Adjarian and Turkish troops, made a swift advance towards Akhaltsikhe, took control of the city and besieged its citadel defended by General Bebutov. The garrison held out and Ahmed's brother Avdi Bey was unable to prevent the Russian reinforcements from arriving though the Borjomi Gorge. On 4 March 1829, Ahmed retreated into Adjara. He launched another offensive against Akhaltsikh in April, but was defeated by General Burtsev at Tsurtskabi on 30 April. After these defeats, Ahmed and Bebutov renewed clandestine negotiations, which failed completely after the latter was succeeded by General Osten-Sacken as a commander in Akhaltsikh. In August 1829, Osten-Sacken took advantage of Ahmed's absence in the area of Batum and invaded Upper Adjara with a force of 3,000. He occupied and sacked Khulo, but found himself under siege in a difficult mountainous terrain and had to fight his way, with heavy casualties inflicted by disease and Adjarian guerrillas, back to Akhaltsikh. The second attempt by the Russians to invade Adjara, this time by General Hesse from Guria, was dashed at Tsikhisdziri in September 1829. The road to Guria now lay open for the Adjarians, but the news of a peace treaty arrived and all operations in the area were halted.  Later career  The 1829 Treaty of Adrianople left Akhaltsikh in the Russian hands and Ahmed, finally, opted for the loyal service to the Ottomans. He became a beylerbey of √áƒ±ldƒ±r and Kars and of Erzurum in 1836. He had a rank of serasker and was awarded a number of Ottoman orders. He died while fighting the Kurdish rebels in northern Anatolia in October 1836. Ahmed was succeeded as a bey in Upper Adjara by his brother, Kor Hussein Bey, as his son, ≈ûerif, was still in his minority.

Work for the women's wrestling in India Ram's struggle to introduce women's wrestling in India begun in 1997, which was the year of its inclusion in the Olympics. To start with, he persuaded both of his daughters ‚Äì Sonika Kaliraman and Deepika Kaliraman ‚Äì to join wrestling. His wrestling training center, which is commonly known as the Chandgi Ram Akhara, became India's first training center for women's wrestling. He also started to persuade coaches and wrestlers around the country to introduce women's exhibition matches in the traditional wrestling tournaments. All these efforts resulted in severe opposition both from the outsiders and the insiders of his training center. At one of the instances, when Ram's two daughters went to the wrestling pit during a village tournament of Haryana, they, along with Ram, were stoned and chased by the villagers. But, in spite of all the opposition, he kept on his efforts. Sonika went on to win country's highest wrestling title ‚Äì Bharat Kesri ‚Äì along with becoming Asian Junior Wrestling Champion. Ram also influenced future women's wrestling coaches. One of his wards, Mahavir Singh Phogat ‚Äì who trained at Ram's center since the age of 16 ‚Äì was persuaded by Ram to introduce his daughters to wrestling. Phogat went on to train his daughters Geeta and Babita, along with their cousin Vinesh, all of whom became international wrestlers.

Lithograph by Hector Dumas. The Colonne Orchestra is a French symphony orchestra, founded in 1873 by the violinist and conductor √âdouard Colonne. History While leader of the Op√©ra de Paris orchestra, √âdouard Colonne was engaged by the publisher Georges Hartmann to lead a series of popular concerts which he founded under the title of ‚ÄòConcert National‚Äô in March 1873.Cinquante Ans de Musique Fran√ßaise de 1874 √† 1925. Les √âditions Musicales de la Librairie de France, Paris, 1925. While at first a great success, the financial burden forced Hartmann to withdraw from the enterprise. However, Colonne then decided to form his own orchestra, ‚Äòl‚ÄôAssociation artistique des Concerts Colonne‚Äô based at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet in November 1873. The Concerts Colonne placed particular emphasis on contemporary music of the time (Saint-Sa√´ns, Massenet, Charpentier, Faur√©, d'Indy, Debussy, Ravel, Widor, Enescu, Dukas and Chabrier). Alongside these were programmed Wagner and Richard Strauss, and Colonne revived the music of Hector Berlioz such as La Damnation de Faust, which was performed 172 times up to the First World War. Gustav Mahler, Peter Tchaikovsky, Claude Debussy, Edvard Grieg, Richard Strauss, Maurice Ravel, Gabriel Pierne, and Prokofiev conducted their music with the orchestra over the years. Even after the departure of its founder the orchestra championed new music, with 22 premieres in the 1923‚Äì24 season.Nichols R. The Harlequin Years; Music in Paris 1917‚Äì1929.

Rich owns a production company, Clarkson Creative, that specializes in photography, video production, design, and book publishing among other things. In addition, his company has organized the top-tier photography educational workshops, Summit Series of Photography Workshops, for over 30 years. The small group also handles all championship photography for the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) and Colorado Rockies baseball club. Biography Early life Born in Oklahoma City, Clarkson moved to Lawrence, Kansas at age 3 where he would grow up above one of the town's greatest restaurants, The Colonial Tea Room. His grandmother, Fannie Murphy, owned the restaurant with his mother, Mary, working as a hostess and greeting guests in the dining room. The restaurant drew Kansas professors, local politicians, and businessmen, exposing the young Clarkson to those intellects daily. Meeting the inventor of basketball In 1939 at age 7, Clarkson and his friends snuck through the University of Kansas heating system to find their way into Robinson Gymnasium where the Kansas basketball team practiced. One day, the boys found the team in the middle of a workout, so they took a seat along the wall and watched coach Phog Allen instruct his team. When the coach spotted the boys during a water break, he introduced them to another guest at his practice. \\"Boys, why don't you meet the other gentleman who's watching the game?\\" Clarkson recalls Allen saying to them. Then he introduced them to Allen's old coach, the man who created the game: James Naismith. College years Clarkson continued his photography through his adolescence to the Journalism school at his local college, University of Kansas. Through his college career, he was able to follow coach Phog Allen and his team on many road trips for games. In addition, the late North Carolina coach Dean Smith was a player on that same basketball team. The team enjoyed having Rich there to document their story and Rich would often room with the 12th player on the team, Dean Smith. Rich later documented The University of Kansas toward their 1952 National Championship where Kansas defeated St. John's 80-63 for the title. In 1956, Clarkson graduated from the School of Journalism at KU. When Wilt Chamberlain arrived in Lawrence to begin his collegiate basketball career, Rich had just graduated from the University of Kansas and was putting together the start of his photojournalistic career. It was at this time the most prestigious of sports publications had just arrived on the scene: Sports Illustrated. He took the occasion when preseason picture day arrived to photograph the 7-foot Wilt from every angle‚Äîjumping, dunking, rebounding and just standing under the basket. This was to be his first introduction to SI. But as he was finishing photographing Wilt, it seemed that nothing Clarkson was doing made him look as tall and imposing as he was in real life. His last-minute idea was to pose him seated, tying his shoes. Wilt's waist was unusually high and his legs very long. When he sat in the folding chair Rich brought onto the court, he finally made him look tall in a picture. He then packaged up a set of prints and dropped them into the mail to Sports Illustrated. As luck would have it, his package arrived on the desk of picture editor Jerry Astor on the very morning that managing editor Andre Laguerre had decided to do a Chamberlain story. Instead of sending a photographer from New York to Lawrence, they used his picture. Three months later, Astor called to give Rich his first big-time magazine assignment to photograph the Kansas-Iowa State game in Lawrence for Sports Illustrated. Days at The Topeka Capital-Journal After graduation, he served as an information services officer in the Air Force for two years before becoming director of photography of the Topeka Capital-Journal, a position he held for 21 years during which time the newspaper became a recognized national leader in use of photography. Eleven members of that newspaper staff were then or eventually honored as Newspaper of Magazine Photographers of the Year for the nation. And through all this, Clarkson remained a contract photographer for Sports Illustrated magazine covering regional and national games. Just a few of the most notable photographers he mentored during his time at Topeka are the following: * Chris Johns, chief content officer for National Geographic Society * Brian Lanker, Pulitzer Prize winner and Life photographer * David Alan Harvey, Magnum Photos member and National Geographic photographer * Jim Richardson, National Geographic photographer * Susan Biddle, White House photographer and staff photographer at The Washington Post * Susan Ford, American author and daughter of former U.S. President Gerald Ford Publishing He has been a contributor to numerous publications on photojournalism and sports and has co-authored six books including ‚ÄúThe Jim Ryun Story‚Äù with Cordner Nelson in 1967, ‚ÄúSooner‚Äù with Bill Bruns in 1972, ‚ÄúKnight With the Hoosiers‚Äù with Bob Hammel in 1975, ‚ÄúMontreal ‚Äò76‚Äù with Bill Bruns in 1976, ‚ÄúThe Final Four‚Äù with Billy Reed in 1988 and ‚ÄúSilver Knight‚Äù with Bob Hammel in 1996. He produced an entirely new version of the book, The Final Four‚Äù with the 60th anniversary of the tournament in 2001. He was the compiling editor of ‚ÄúThe Kansas Century: 100 Years of Jayhawk Basketball‚Äù in 1997 and ‚ÄúWorld Champion Broncos‚Äù in 1998. He was director of photography for the book, ‚ÄúA Day in the Life of America‚Äù in 1986 and was a photographer on four other ‚ÄúDay in the Life‚Äù books. He produced the 25th anniversary commemorative book for the Castle Pines Golf Club in Colorado in 2005 In 1989, he was producer-coordinator for the Brian Lanker project, ‚Äú I Dream A World: Portraits of Black Women who Changed America,‚Äù which included both a book, now in its 15th printing, and two traveling exhibitions. It became the second best-selling picture book ever in America. Portfolios of pictures were reprinted in the National Geographic, U. S. News & World Report and LIFE magazines in addition to major display in many American newspapers. Clarkson Creative have produced 23 other hardback books ranging in subject from ‚ÄúNotre Dame Football Today‚Äù to ‚ÄúSmall Town America.‚Äù Clarkson was a principal designer and curator for the NCAA Hall of Champions, a 12,000-square foot museum of college sports memorabilia and pictures in the NCAA headquarters building formerly in suburban Kansas City.

The original building built in the late 1920s is noted for its Art Deco style. The jail was designated an Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument on November 30, 1993.  History  Lincoln Heights Jail was originally built in 1927 at a cost of $5 million and opened in 1931. The initial five-story building was constructed to accommodate 625 prisoners. The jail was expanded in the early 1950s to accommodate 2,800 prisoners. Notable detainees included Al Capone and individuals arrested during the Zoot Suit Riots and the Watts riots. In 1951, the unprovoked beating of seven prisoners occurred in the prison on what came to be known as \\"Bloody Christmas\\". The jail was decommissioned in 1965, after the Los Angeles City Council and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors agreed to consolidate inmates in a nearby county jail as a cost-efficiency measure. From 1979 until 2014, the building was the home of the Bilingual Foundation of the Arts.\\"DOWNTOWN : Bilingual Arts Group Gets $250,000 Grant\\", Los Angeles Times, December 18, 1994.Randal C. Archibold, \\"Old Country and New in a Tale of Tamales\\", The New York Times, December 14, 2008.  Redevelopment  In 2016, the City of Los Angeles issued a Request for Interest to garner development ideas to revitalize the sprawling jail complex. In 2017, Lincoln Property Company and Fifteen Group were selected to redevelop the Lincoln Heights Jail complex into the Lincoln Heights Makers District, which will feature a commercial and manufacturing spaces, a public market, creative office space, live-work housing, an amphitheater with green space, recreation areas and a communal rooftop deck. As of March 2020, the project has been delayed due to environmental issues with the site.  In popular culture  The novel L.A. Confidential and subsequent film, part of which was filmed there, was inspired by the incident. The 1984 horror movie Nightmare on Elm Street filmed the boiler room scenes here. Some prison scenes in American History X were shot on the roof. The television series Cagney & Lacey used it as a filming location. The scene in Iron Man 2 where main antagonist Ivan Vanko breaks out of prison was also filmed at this location. It was used to film part of the music video \\"Feeling This\\" by Blink-182. The site was also used for filming sections of Lady Gaga's hit single \\"Telephone\\" and 5 Seconds of Summer's single \\"Good Girls\\".

The home was built between 1837 and 1842 by Charles Alexandre Grevemberg, who operated a successful sugar plantation on the surrounding . The home is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. After Charles Alexandre Grevemberg's death at Albania in 1851, his wife, Euphemie Fuselier (d. 1886), managed the plantation. Records of the sugar crops made in Louisiana 1859‚Äì1860 shows Mrs. Charles Grevemberg producing 475 hogsheads of sugar on the Bayou Teche. Samuel and Isaac Delgado acquired the property in 1885. Isaac Delgado bequeathed it to the City of New Orleans which operated the sugar plantation through the Delgado-Albania Plantation Commission. In 1957 the City of New Orleans sold the plantation house and surrounding acreage at public auction. It was acquired by Emily Cyr Bridges, who restored Albania Mansion and opened it to the public showcasing her well-known collection. Miss Emily was an enthusiastic antiquarian who traveled the countryside knocking on doors to add to her collection of Southern plantation furniture and Acadian artifacts, at a time before such objects were highly prized. Miss Emily was the daughter of Paul N. Cyr, Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1931, under Governor Huey Long. In one of the more colorful Long-era incidents, Cyr had himself sworn in as governor in October 1931, stating that Long had vacated the office when he was elected U.S. Senator. Long called out the National Guard and the State Police to bar Cyr from the Governor's Mansion. Miss Emily shared her father's disdain for Huey Long, and banned his name from being spoken at Albania. Never a conventional woman, Miss Emily was a pioneer aviator who flew patrol missions over the Louisiana coast as a member of the Civil Air Patrol during World War II. In Miss Emily's heyday at Albania she loved to entertain on the galleries; her coterie included artist-in-residence Lucius Lacour. In her later years Miss Emily became reclusive, rarely receiving guests and never leaving her beloved Albania. The home is currently owned by Hunt Slonem, the celebrated New York artist. Slonem bought the house for about $625,000 in 2005.

Marcel Delannoy. In: The New Grove Dictionary of Opera. Macmillan, London and New York, 1997. He wrote operas, ballets, orchestral works, vocal and chamber works, and film scores. Life and career Marcel Delannoy was born at La Fert√©-Alais, Essonne, France. He initially studied painting and architecture and entered the √âcole des Beaux- Arts, but at age 20 he took up music. Having been mobilised during the First World War, he then worked as an artist. However, he was initially self-taught and never attended a conservatory, but he did receive some encouragement from Arthur Honegger (whose biography he wrote in 1953) and some lessons from Alexis Roland-Manuel and Andr√© Gedalge. He made his name with the opera Le Poirier de mis√®re (1927), which attracted favourable commentary from Maurice Ravel, among others. That same year, he was one of ten composers who collaborated on a children's ballet, L'√©ventail de Jeanne (contributing the 'Bourr√©e'). In 1932, Delannoy was one of five composers approached by the producers of the film Don Quichotte for a series of songs to be sung by its star, the Russian bass Feodor Chaliapin. The other composers invited were Ravel, Jacques Ibert, Manuel de Falla and Darius Milhaud. Ibert's setting was chosen for the film.Classical Archives He wrote criticism for Les Nouveaux temps, where he reviewed the first Paris performance of Olivier Messiaen's Quartet for the End of Time on 24 June 1941, in which he strongly objected to the written commentary accompanying the work.Rebecca Rischin: For the end of time ‚Äì The story of the Messiaen quartetMessiaen Studies The Association de Musique Contemporaine (AMC), of which Delannoy was a committee member, included his works in its early concerts of 1940-41.

Alice Swanson Esty commissioned and premiered his song cycle La Voix du Silence (1958).New World Records The baroque oboist and recorder player Michel Piguet (19322004) studied with Delannoy.Project Muse Delannoy married the pianist Lisette Claveau.

Wood was one of the last players cut from the Reds' roster in Spring Training, and was one of many competing for the Reds' fifth starter spot. In a crowded race featuring veterans Mike Lincoln and Justin Lehr, young arms Micah Owings and Matt Maloney, and prospects Sam LeCure, Aroldis Chapman, and Mike Leake, Wood came down to the last two but was cut in favor of Leake.

Regardless, Wood actually could not have finished the perfect game in the ninth inning, because Phillies ace Roy Halladay, who himself had thrown a perfect game earlier in the 2010 season, also was pitching a shutout through nine innings. Wood exited after nine innings of one-hit ball, and the Reds would later lose the game 1‚Äì0 in 11 innings, with Ruiz scoring the winning run.

Today, the 1st, 3rd and 5th Groups of CACW are still operating in Taiwan, reorganized as 443rd, 427th and 401st Tactical Fighter Wings of the Republic of China Air Force.  Operational history  Aircraft assigned to the CACW included late-series P-40 Warhawks (with the Nationalist Chinese Air Force blue sky with 12-pointed white sun national insignia, rudder markings and squadron/aircraft numbering) and B-25 \\"Mitchell\\" medium bombers. The Mitchells included the B-25D & later B-25J series level bombers, the B-25H series attack/ gunship versions equipped with a 75-millimeter cannon in the nose. The Mitchell markings were like the CACW's fighters, wearing the Nationalist Chinese star insignia on the wings and fuselage. In late 1944, USAAF-marked P-51 Mustangs of the B and C series began to be assigned to CACW pilots. Then, in early 1945, \\"D\\" and \\"K\\" series arrived. Those series differed in details such as the propeller but shared many external characteristics including the bubble canopy. All U.S. pilots assigned to the CACW were listed as rated pilots in Chinese Air Force, and were authorized to wearing both pilot's wings of both nations. During its year and a half of operations, the Chinese and American airmen of the CACW could claim the destruction of 190 Japanese aircraft in air-to-air combat, and 301 more on the ground. The fighters and bombers of the CACW had destroyed at least 1500 Japanese vehicles and sunk several hundred thousand tons of Japanese merchant and naval shipping, in addition they had taken a heavy toll on Japanese ground troops, facilities, railroads and bridges. In that same time, they had lost 35 fighters and 8 bombers to enemy ground fire, and 20 fighters to Japanese aircraft. However, not a single CACW bomber had been lost to enemy fighters, a tribute to the abilities of the Wing's B-25 aircrews, and the quality of the escort protection provided by the Wing's fighter pilots. The most successful fighter pilot of the CACW was Lt. Colonel William N. Reed, who had first fought in China as a member of the AVG. As a \\"Flying Tiger,\\" Reed had destroyed 3 Japanese aircraft in aerial combat and 8 more on the ground. Then returning to China to command the CACW's 7th Fighter Squadron and eventually its 3d Fighter Group, he would destroy an additional 6 Japanese aircraft in aerial combat. According to the book \\"China Bombers\\" by Ken Daniels, Reed was killed while parachuting from a disabled P-40 on December 19, 1944. Another known CACW member, Ho Weng Toh, is reportedly the last surviving member of the Flying Tigers (the Fourteenth Air Force adopted the AVG's nickname) in Singapore and Asia. In 1944, Ho flew the B-25 Mitchell in China with the CACW after receiving training in the United States Army Air Forces (predecessor of United States Air Force). Becoming a commercial pilot after World War 2, Captain Ho retired in 1980 as Chief Pilot of Singapore Airlines, being one of the airline's pioneering pilots.  Stations  Most CACW bases existed near the boundary of Japanese-Occupied China, and one \\"Valley Field\\" existed in an area within Japanese-held territory. Specific field locations include Hanchung, Ankang, Hsian, Laohokow, Enshih, Liangshan, Peishyi, Chihkiang, Hengyang, Kweilin, Liuchow, Chanyi, Suichwan, and Lingling.

Biography He was born on November 29, 1888. In the autumn of 1907, Private First Class Vernon Burge was assigned to Fort Myer, Virginia, to join the newly formed Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps under Captain Charles deForest Chandler.Tillman, 2006, pp. 20‚Äì21.

No. 1.Tillman, 2006, p. 82. Along with Glenn Madole and a civilian mechanic in August 1910, Burge contrived a way to fasten three wheels to the aircraft so that its skids would not be damaged as much upon landing. Crude as it was, this was the first tricycle landing gear on an aircraft. Foulois' initial reaction was negative: \\"One of the unpleasant features of landing on wheels is the difficulty experienced in stopping the machine.\\"Coffman, 2004, p. 165. However, the wheels saved the aircraft from more frequent repair, and subsequent aircraft models incorporated wheels.

Afterwards, she went on to a long West End theatre career, appearing in both musical theatre and plays. Early life and career Grey was born in London‚Äôs Conduit Street West, the second daughter of Henry Taylor, a linen draper, and his Exeter-born wife Susannah.G√§nzl, Kurt. \\"The third little maid\\", Kurt G√§nzl's blog, 25 April 2018 Grey began her stage career with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1880 as a member of the chorus and understudy during the first London production of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Pirates of Penzance at the Opera Comique, appearing in the small role of Kate for a short period in July 1880. In the company's next opera, Patience, also at the Opera Comique, Grey was in the chorus but may also have understudied the role of Lady Saphir. After Patience moved to the new Savoy Theatre in November 1881, Grey also played the non-singing role of Jane in the curtain raiser Mock Turtles by Frank Desprez and Eaton Faning.Stone, David.

Grey created the non-singing role of Fleta, while continuing as Jane in Mock Turtles. When Mock Turtles was replaced by A Private Wire in March 1883, Grey played Mary, the maid. Later that year, she was given the singing role of Leila in Iolanthe. She continued as both Mary and Leila until January 1884, when both operas closed. In the next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, Princess Ida, she created the role of Sacharissa. When that opera closed, she was in the chorus of the revival of The Sorcerer and played the minor role of First Bridesmaid in the accompanying Trial by Jury. Grey created the role of Peep- Bo, one of the three Little Maids, in the original production of The Mikado, with Jessie Bond (Pitti-Sing) and Leonora Braham (Yum-Yum), for the show's entire run from 1885 to 1887. In an 1885 interview with the New York Daily Tribune, author W. S.

Later years After leaving D'Oyly Carte, Grey enjoyed a long West End theatre career. She began with Drury Lane pantomimes, including playing one of the Merry Men in Babes in the Wood in 1888 with Harry Payne, Dan Leno as the Dame, and Harriet Vernon as Robin Hood. She and Rosina Brandram appeared in a musical version of Newport (The Song of the Looking Glass) in a vanity production at Devonshire House.

To meet this challenge, WWAP coordinates the work of 31 UN-Water members and international partners under the umbrella mechanism of UN-Water, in the production of the World Water Development Report (WWDR). The WWDR is the UN flagship report on water issues; it is a comprehensive review, released every year with a different focus on different strategic water issues, that gives an overall picture of the state, use and management of the world‚Äôs freshwater resources and aims to provide decision-makers with tools to formulate and implement sustainable water policies. Background The growing global water crisis threatens the security, stability and environmental sustainability of developing but also developed nations. Millions die each year from water-borne diseases, while water pollution and ecosystem destruction aggravate, particularly in the developing world. Over the past few decades there has been an increasing acceptance that the management of water resources must be undertaken with an integrated approach, that assessment of the resource is of fundamental importance as the basis for decision-making and that national capacities to undertake necessary assessments must be fully supported. Management decisions to alleviate poverty, to allow economic development, to ensure food security and the health of human populations as well as preserve vital ecosystems, must be based on our best possible understanding of all relevant systems. In 1998, the Sixth Session of the Commission on Sustainable Development stated that there was a need for regular, global assessments on the status of freshwater resources. In response to this the World Water Assessment Programme was founded in 2000 to coordinate the production of the UN World Water Development Report (WWDR), and to report on the status of global freshwater resources. Initially the periodicity and coverage of the Report was triennial and comprehensive, but in 2012, UN-Water changed it to have an annual and theme oriented Report. Recent and future key themes addressed by the WWDRs are: * Water and Energy (WWDR 2014); * Water for a sustainable world (WWDR 2015); * Water and jobs(WWDR 2016); * Wastewater, The Untapped Resource (WWDR 2017); * Nature-based solutions for water (WWDR 2018); * Leaving no one behind (WWDR 2019); and * Water and climate change (WWDR 2020). Mission and Objectives This UNESCO programme aims to equip water managers and policy- and decision-makers with knowledge, tools and skills necessary to formulate and implement sustainable water policies. The Programme's objectives are to: ‚Ä¢ Monitor, assess and report on the world's freshwater resources and ecosystems, water use and management, and identify critical issues and problems; ‚Ä¢ Help countries develop their own assessment capacity; ‚Ä¢ Raise awareness on current and imminent/future water related challenges to influence the global water agenda; ‚Ä¢ Learn and respond to the needs of decision-makers and water resource managers; ‚Ä¢ Promote gender equality; ‚Ä¢ Measure progress towards achieving sustainable use of water resources through robust indicators; and ‚Ä¢ Support anticipatory decision- making on the global water system including the identification of alternative futures. Activities The United Nations World Water Development Report The United Nations World Water Development Report (WWDR), is the UN-Water flagship report on water. It is a comprehensive review that gives an overall picture of the state, use and management of the world‚Äôs freshwater resources and aims to provide decision-makers with tools to formulate and implement sustainable water policies. From 2003 till 2012, the WWDR was produced and released every three years following a comprehensive approach. As a result of a Global Stakeholder Survey in 2012, UN-Water decided to change the periodicity of the WWDR into an annual production with a thematic focus on different strategic water issues. The content produced for the WWDR serves as basis for the celebrations of World Water Day (22 March) and related discussions throughout the year. Through a series of assessments, the Reports provide a mechanism for monitoring changes in the resource and its management and tracking progress towards achieving targets, particularly those of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Reports also offer best practices as well as in- depth theoretical analyses to help stimulate ideas and actions for better stewardship in the water sector. This authoritative publication is the result of a highly concerted process among partners and members comprising UN-Water under the coordination of WWAP. WWAP Case Studies One of the key objectives of WWAP is to help countries improve their self-assessment capability by building on existing strengths and experiences. WWAP fulfils this mission by assisting in the preparation of case studies in countries around the world in order to highlight the state of water resources where different physical, climatic and socio-economic conditions prevail. In this regard, case studies show the diversity of circumstances and different human needs. The second purpose of the case studies is to highlight the challenges that need to be addressed in the water resources sector. In the process, the skills and experience of both local water professionals and policy-makers are engaged and enhanced. WWAP is both global and local in scale, for it must check the accuracy of the big picture on the basis of snapshots of water in the field. In the global strategy to improve the overall quality of water resources, local actions often present the starting point the most fruitful efforts. The WWAP case studies aim to provide a snapshot of those efforts while showing the significance of the decisions taken at local, sub-national and national levels. The lessons learned, from both successes and failures, may be shared with other countries interested in addressing such issues. SDG 6 ‚Äì Synthesis Report The SDG 6 Synthesis Report aims to provide an overview of the status of SDG 6 implementation at the global and regional levels, as well as some comprehensive information about how SDG 6 is interlinked to other SDG targets and indicators of the Agenda 2030 and the overall sustainability challenges that nations around the world are faced with. By summarizing the progress towards the achievement of SDG 6, this report will provide Member States with the ‚Äòbig picture‚Äô on water and sanitation issues, outlining ways to accelerate progress towards this goal. Lessons learned and win-win solutions by which more than one SDG is benefited from SDG 6-related actions, as well as trade- offs and the potential implication of policies adopted by countries will be highlighted. This will enable countries to develop a roadmap towards a more sustainable development, for which water is critical in many regards. The World Water Assessment Programme coordinates a Task Force to produce the SDG 6 Synthesis Report 2018, composed by some UN-Water members, such as CEO Water Mandate, FAO, ILO, UN-Habitat, UN-Water Technical Advisory Unit (TAU), UNDP, UNECE, UNEP, UNESCO, UNICEF, UNU, WHO, WMO and World Bank. Capacity Development WWAP strengthens the policy-science interface and supports decision-making on water through targeted capacity reinforcement and knowledge sharing initiatives. The capacity building activities are tailored around 3 key themes: UN World Water Development Report ‚Ä¢ Water and Sustainable Development: The training facilitates peer to peer exchange, development of country case studies and follow-up at country level. The workshop provides policy makers with tools for assessing water data, managing water resources and competing users, dealing with extreme events and with the challenge of growing urban environments. ‚Ä¢ Wastewater The Untapped Resource: The training equips participants with the understanding of innovative approaches through concrete examples of successful applications of water use efficiency, water reuse, and bridging the policy-science interface. Achieving the 2030 Agenda: Inspired by the UN-Water SDG 6 Synthesis Report 2018 on Water and Sanitation, this training program aims at supporting the Member States in the realization of the 2030 Agenda, with a particular focus on the implementation of the targets of SDG 6 ‚Äúensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all‚Äù, and the interlinkages with other SDGs. Water and Gender: ‚Ä¢ Trainings at country level on sex-disaggregated water data collection and gender analysis. ‚Ä¢ Trainings on integrating gender equality, woman empowerment & social inclusion in IWRM initiatives & water policies. Water and Gender In 2014 WWAP has started a ground-breaking project on gender-sensitive water assessment, monitoring and reporting, with a goal to demonstrate how water is a gendered issue. Although women play a key role in the provision, management and safeguarding on water, gender inequality persist on the globe. The Advisor Group on Gender Equality founded in 2010, developed a series of indicators for the collection of sex-disaggregated water data, which are contained/included in the ‚ÄúToolkits‚Äù, with the aim of addressing the considerable data gap on gender and water issues at the global level. The project developed a methodology using the indicators with the aim of advocating for the implementation of gender-sensitive water monitoring in the post-2015 agenda and, in particular, in the monitoring framework of the SDGs.

The type species is C. newmanorum, described by Roger Benson and Jonathan Radley in 2010. Discovery Hip and leg bones Scapular bones The remains of the holotype were discovered in the early 1960s in the Cross Hands Quarry, near Little Compton, in Warwickshire in England. These fossils came from the Chipping Norton Limestone Formation, which is dated to the lower Bathonian stage of the Middle Jurassic, about 167 mya (million years ago). The fossils were stored in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery until 2008 when they were transferred to the Warwickshire Museum Service; the transfer prompted closer study of the neglected fossils. Unrecognized fossils of dinosaurs, many of them theropods, had been discovered in England at least as early as 1677. The larger theropod fossils had been attributed (without critical examination) to Megalosaurus, while the smaller ones were assigned to Iliosuchus. The 2010 paper recognized differences between the Cross Hands Quarry discovery and those attributed to Megalosaurus. These differences include lower and broader spines along the animal's back, and differences in leg and hip bones. The authors renamed the Cross Hands Quarry specimens Cruxicheiros newmanorum; the generic name Cruxicheiros comes from a mixture of Latin and Greek, Latin crux meaning \\"cross\\" and Greek cheir meaning \\"hand,\\" in reference to the Cross Hands Quarry locality where the fossils were discovered. The specific name newmanorum honors the Newman family, who own the quarry. Description Cruxicheiros was a large theropod, but the known material is very limited. The holotype, cataloged as WARMS G15770, is a partial right femur. Additional material from the site probably comes from the same individual as the holotype, based on examination of the matrix of sandy limestone and calcite which make up all the fossils. The additional material consists of \\"an anterior dorsal or posterior cervical vertebra; a dorsal neural arch; a partial dorsal vertebra; the anterior half of a middle-distal caudal vertebra; a partial right scapulocoracoid; a partial left ilium; the proximal end of a left pubis; [and] numerous rib and bone fragments\\". In 2012 Thomas Holtz estimated its length at 9 meters (29.5 feet). Phylogeny and classification Cruxicheiros was a tetanuran, a member of the dinosaur group Tetanurae which also includes theropods such as Tyrannosaurus and Spinosaurus. The describers did not place Cruxicheiros in any family. They performed a cladistic analysis which rendered three equally probable positions for Cruxicheiros: as the most basal neotetanuran (the line which gave rise to dinosaurs like Allosaurus and birds), as the most basal megalosauroid (the line which led to Megalosaurus and Spinosaurus), or as the most basal member of the Tetanurae, whose earliest members must have predated the split between these theropod groups. In view of the uncertainties they classified Cruxicheiros as Tetanurae incertae sedis.

He previously played for the New York Yankees, Minnesota Twins, San Francisco Giants and Boston Red Sox. Although shortstop is his primary position, N√∫√±ez serves as a utility infielder, and played in the outfield for the Yankees as well. The Yankees signed N√∫√±ez as an international free agent in 2004. He played minor league baseball in their organization from 2005 through 2010, until he made his MLB debut with the Yankees on August 19, 2010. Due to struggles and inconsistency, N√∫√±ez was designated for assignment by the Yankees at the start of the 2014 season. He was traded to the Twins, and enjoyed a breakout season in 2016, when he was named to appear in the MLB All- Star Game. He was traded to the Giants in 2016, and to the Red Sox in 2017. In July 2019, N√∫√±ez was designated for assignment and then released by the Red Sox. He signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets in 2020. Professional career Minor leagues The New York Yankees signed N√∫√±ez as an international free agent in February 2004. The organization introduced him to Derek Jeter, his childhood idol, at a press conference, where they told Jeter that N√∫√±ez was to be their eventual replacement for Jeter as the Yankees' starting shortstop. N√∫√±ez made his professional debut in minor league baseball with the Staten Island Yankees of the Class A Short Season New York‚ÄìPennsylvania League in the 2005 season. Nunez represented the Yankees in the league's All-Star Game. That season, the Yankees won their third consecutive league championship, and Nunez was rated as the fourth-best prospect in the New York‚ÄìPenn League. Going into the 2006 season, Baseball America ranked N√∫√±ez the sixth-best prospect in the Yankees organization, and the prospect with the best throwing arm. The Yankees started N√∫√±ez with the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League in 2006; he struggled with Tampa, and the Yankees demoted him to the Charleston RiverDogs of the Class A South Atlantic League (SAL) on May 17. Overall, N√∫√±ez had a .214 batting average for Tampa and Charleston. In 2007, N√∫√±ez started the season with Charleston, and was named the starting shortstop for the Southern Division in the SAL All-Star Game. He was promoted to Tampa on July 28. He played for Tampa in 2008, batting .271 with six home runs and 42 runs batted in (RBI) in 94 games. He was promoted to the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League for the 2009 season. With Trenton, he had a .322 batting average in 123 games and appeared in the Eastern League All-Star Game, in which he got two hits. The Yankees promoted N√∫√±ez to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the Class AAA International League for the 2009 playoffs. Following the 2009 season, the Yankees added N√∫√±ez to their 40-man roster to protect him from being selected by another franchise in the Rule 5 draft. In 2010, the Yankees assigned N√∫√±ez to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. There, he batted .289 in 118 games, with 55 runs scored, 25 doubles, three triples, four home runs, 50 RBI, and 23 stolen bases. He was named to the International League All-Star team, the postseason All-Star team, and the Topps Triple-A All-Star Team. N√∫√±ez won the Kevin Lawn Award as the Yankees' minor league player of the year for 2010. New York Yankees N√∫√±ez was called up to the majors for the first time on August 19, 2010 after Lance Berkman was placed on the 15-day disabled list. N√∫√±ez debuted on the same day, replacing Jeter in the seventh inning and fouling out in his only plate appearance. N√∫√±ez received playing time as a fill-in for Jeter and the then-injured Alex Rodriguez. On August 21, N√∫√±ez recorded his first major league hit, a go-ahead RBI single into right field. N√∫√±ez hit his first career home run against the Chicago White Sox on August 28, 2010. He also stole his first career base the same day. In 30 games for the Yankees, N√∫√±ez hit .280, with one home run, seven RBIs, and scored 12 runs. When Mark Teixeira suffered an injury during the 2010 American League Championship Series, the Yankees replaced him on their postseason roster with N√∫√±ez. After the season, Baseball America rated him as the eighth-best prospect in the Yankees organization, while also naming him the \\"Best Defensive Infielder\\" and the \\"Best Infield Arm\\" in the Yankees organization. New York Yankees in 2011 N√∫√±ez beat out Ramiro Pe√±a for the role as the utility infielder to start the 2011 season. With the Yankees, N√∫√±ez played approximately two games a week, allowing Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez to rest more often. N√∫√±ez batted .339 while filling in for the Yankees as their starting shortstop for three weeks while Jeter was injured; he later became the team's starting third baseman when Rodriguez required arthroscopic knee surgery. In addition to playing various infield positions, manager Joe Girardi also used N√∫√±ez as an outfielder when Nick Swisher experienced tendinitis in his elbow. N√∫√±ez played in 112 games for the Yankees, and led the team in errors with 20, despite only playing part-time. Despite his defensive struggles, the Yankees viewed N√∫√±ez as likely to make their 25-man roster out of spring training in 2012 as a utility infielder. With Brett Gardner, the Yankees' starting left fielder, injuring his elbow, N√∫√±ez received playing time in left field, as well as the infield. In his first twenty games of the 2012 New York Yankees season, N√∫√±ez hit .294, but committed four errors in 58 chances. The day after he committed two errors in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays, N√∫√±ez was demoted to the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre team. The team decided to abandon their approach of using N√∫√±ez as a utility player so that he can receive daily playing time at shortstop and second base, as the organization still views him as an everyday shortstop. On September 1, 2012, the Yankees promoted N√∫√±ez from Triple-A and manager Joe Girardi placed him into the starting lineup against the Baltimore Orioles for that day. He finished the regular season with a .292 batting average in 82 at-bats. Though he was left off of the Yankees' postseason roster for the 2012 American League Championship Series, he was added to the roster when Jeter suffered a fractured ankle. In Game 3 of the 2012 ALCS, N√∫√±ez hit his first career postseason home run off of Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander. The Yankees lost the series to the Tigers in a 4-game sweep. Heading into the 2013 season, Yankees' General Manager Brian Cashman said that if N√∫√±ez were to make the team, he would do so as a utility infielder, reversing the team's position. However, N√∫√±ez only played shortstop during spring training. Jeter began the season on the disabled list, and N√∫√±ez started at shortstop for the Yankees on Opening Day. N√∫√±ez was placed on the 15-day disabled list on May 12 after missing the previous week due to soreness in his left rib cage. He was then transferred to the 60-day disabled list due to a strained left oblique. He was activated from the disabled list on July 6 after missing 2 months. He ended the season with a .260 batting average and 28 RBIs in 90 games played. In spring training in 2014, N√∫√±ez competed with Zelous Wheeler, Yangervis Solarte, Dean Anna, and Scott Sizemore for a reserve infielder role with the Yankees. With reserve infielder Brendan Ryan starting the season on the disabled list, the Yankees chose Anna and Solarte over N√∫√±ez. To add Solarte to the roster, the Yankees designated N√∫√±ez for assignment. Minnesota Twins With the hope of improving their offense, the Minnesota Twins acquired N√∫√±ez from the Yankees on April 7, 2014, in exchange for minor league pitcher Miguel Sulbaran. The Twins optioned him to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. After batting 7-for-22 (.318) for Rochester, he was promoted to the Twins as the 26th man on their roster for a doubleheader on April 17, and was optioned back the next day. He finished the season with a .250 batting average in 72 games played with the Twins. N√∫√±ez and the Twins agreed to a $1.025 million salary for the 2015 season, avoiding salary arbitration. In 72 games in 2015, N√∫√±ez hit .282/.327/.431 with 4 HR and 20 RBI across 4 positions for the Twins. 2016 All-Star Game Avoiding arbitration with the Twins at $1.475 million for the 2016 season, N√∫√±ez entered the season expecting to compete for a reserve role.Twins' Eduardo Nunez: Avoids arbitration with Twins On the Twins Opening Day roster in 2016, N√∫√±ez impressed in April, hitting .373 in 18 games in a reserve role. However, following an injury to shortstop Eduardo Escobar, N√∫√±ez began earning more playing time as the team's starting shortstop. With an injury to third baseman Trevor Plouffe, N√∫√±ez remained in the lineup following Escobar's return. He became the Twins' leadoff hitter. On July 5, N√∫√±ez was named to his first All- Star Game. In 91 games with the Twins to begin 2016, N√∫√±ez batted .296 with 27 stolen bases, 12 home runs, and 47 RBI. San Francisco Giants On July 28, 2016, the Twins traded N√∫√±ez to the San Francisco Giants for left-handed minor league pitcher Adalberto Mej√≠a. In 50 games with the Giants to finish 2016, N√∫√±ez batted .269 with 13 stolen bases, 4 home runs, and 20 RBI. Overall in 2016, combined with both teams, N√∫√±ez played 141 total games with a .288 batting average, 40 stolen bases, 16 home runs, and 67 RBI. To begin 2017, N√∫√±ez played 76 games with the Giants, batting .308 with 18 stolen bases, 4 home runs, and 31 RBI. Boston Red Sox ;2017 On July 25, 2017, the Giants traded N√∫√±ez to the Boston Red Sox for minor league pitchers Shaun Anderson and Gregory Santos. On September 9, N√∫√±ez injured his right knee, later diagnosed as a sprained posterior cruciate ligament. He returned to the Red Sox lineup on September 25, but left the game after aggravating the injury. In finishing the 2017 regular season with the Red Sox, N√∫√±ez played 38 games with a .321 batting average and eight home runs. For both teams combined in 2017, N√∫√±ez played 114 regular season games with a .313 batting average, 12 home runs, and 58 RBIs. The Red Sox included N√∫√±ez on their roster for the ALDS against the Houston Astros. He started in Game 1, but collapsed while trying to run out a ground ball in his first at bat, and needed to be carried off the field. The Red Sox removed him from their postseason roster due to the injury. ;2018 On February 18, 2018, the Red Sox signed N√∫√±ez to a one-year contract worth $4 million with a player option worth $4 million for the 2019 season. On Opening Day against the Tampa Bay Rays, he hit an inside-the-park home run. During the regular season, N√∫√±ez appeared in 127 games‚Äîincluding 70 starts at second base primarily due to Dustin Pedroia being on the disabled list‚Äîbatting .265/.289/.388 with 10 home runs and 44 RBIs. N√∫√±ez was included on Boston's postseason roster, appearing in three games of the ALDS and two games of the ALCS. In Game 1 of the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, he hit a pinch-hit three-run home run in his first World Series at bat off of Alex Wood in the seventh inning to put the Red Sox up 8‚Äì4, which would be the final score. It was the first pinch-hit homer of N√∫√±ez's career, as well as the first pinch-hit home run in the World Series since 2009. N√∫√±ez became the 36th player to hit a home run in his first at bat in a World Series, following Matt Kemp who became the 35th player to do so, earlier in the same game. Boston won the World Series in five games, giving N√∫√±ez his first career championship title. ;2019 N√∫√±ez was the Opening Day starting second baseman for the 2019 Red Sox, as Dustin Pedroia began the season on the injured list. On April 5, N√∫√±ez made his major league pitching debut, allowing one run in an inning of relief during a 15‚Äì8 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks. He was placed on the injured list, effective April 18, due to a mid-back strain. On April 29, N√∫√±ez was sent on a rehabilitation assignment with the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox, and he was activated on May 4. N√∫√±ez was designated for assignment on July 15, and released on July 20. With the Red Sox in 2019, N√∫√±ez appeared in 60 games, batting .228 with two home runs and 20 RBIs. New York Mets On January 25, 2020, N√∫√±ez signed a minor league deal with the New York Mets. N√∫√±ez made the Opening Day roster for the Mets. In a late July game, N√∫√±ez suffered a left knee contusion and was placed on the injured list on July 30. Scouting profile The Yankees viewed N√∫√±ez as a possible replacement at shortstop for Jeter. Though they were willing to trade Jes√∫s Montero, their top hitting prospect, the Yankees considered N√∫√±ez untouchable in trade negotiations. Scouts consider N√∫√±ez's throwing arm to be strong, and complement his ability to hit for average, hit for power, and baserunning ability. However, scouts feel he can get \\"lackadaisical in the field\\" and swings at too many pitches outside of the strike zone.

Despite repeated warnings of the importance of Egypt to links with British India, his advice was ignored and thus when Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt in 1798 the British were ill- placed to respond directly. In 1801 he assisted the British counter-invasion of Egypt and later returned to Britain with his wife Jane Maltass, a famous society beauty. Although a highly successful merchant and diplomat, Baldwin found himself a subject of ridicule on his return to Britain for his belief in the healing power of magnets, then widely considered a pseudoscience. He retired to Earl's Court in London and died there in 1826. Early life George Baldwin was born in May 1744 (although some sources give 1743), the son of hop merchant William Baldwin of Borough, London. Aged 16 he was sent to join his brother in Cyprus, where he was consul-general and three years later was sent to Acre. Career During his trading operations in the Eastern Mediterranean, Baldwin became increasingly aware of the political and commercial structures of the Middle East, and in 1768, he traveled to Britain to seek permission to investigate the possibilities of trade running from British India across Egypt via the Red Sea. Although this route was nominally blocked off to non-Muslims, developing trade would be possible if it brought profit to the rulers of Egypt. On his brother's death, Baldwin returned to the Mediterranean and took up his post on Cyprus. In 1773, Mehmed Bey summoned him to Cairo and encouraged British shipping to use Suez, declaring that he would cut a canal from Suez to the Nile for ships to pass directly from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. He was also well received in Constantinople. East India Company In 1774, Baldwin returned to Cairo and then back to England, where he learned that the East India Company had successfully begun a trade route between India and Suez. Offering his services to the Company, Baldwin was accepted and returned again to Egypt, where he was the only British merchant. With his knowledge of Arabic he was able to monopolise British trade caravans passing from Suez to the Nile, and ensured a fast, safe and efficient service. At some point between 1776 and 1778 he was reported to have climbed the Great Pyramid at Giza and drunk a mixture of waters from the Nile, Ganges and Thames, symbolically linking the trade routes he managed. By 1779, his trade was so successful that it began to impinge on that of the Ottoman Sultan and of the Cape of Good Hope, prompting protests and restrictions on his activities. In May, one of his caravans was attacked and looted, with some merchants taken hostage. Baldwin exchanged himself for the merchants and later escaped, reaching Izmir. An attempt to set up in India ended in failure when Baldwin was assaulted and robbed en route, and he and his wife returned to Britain, pausing in Vienna. Return to England While living in England, Baldwin wrote memoranda for the India Board of merchants, emphasising the importance of influence in Egypt to trade with India and the Middle East and the risk to British interests if France was allowed to dominate Egyptian trade. His advice was not taken up and no resources were deployed to the region until 1786, when a license was issued that allowed French merchants to make use of the Red Sea. In response, Baldwin was sent to negotiate similar licenses for British merchants and observe French activities. While there he deepened his interest in magnetic therapy, holding sessions with an Italian poet to investigate the effects of magnetism on the unconscious. When the French Revolutionary Wars broke out between Britain and France in 1793, Baldwin was able to forward the message to the British government in India, which could then take action against French territories there. In 1796, he investigated unsuccessful French efforts to persuade the Egyptian rulers to allow French armies safe passage through their territory on their way to India. Despite his efforts, the British government terminated his post in 1793, although the message did not reach him until 1796. Frustrated, Baldwin left Cairo and thus was not present during the Mediterranean campaign of 1798, when a British force under Sir Horatio Nelson was unable to gain audience with the Egyptian government to warn of the impending attack, as they had no ambassador. When the French invaded Egypt, Baldwin left the country and traveled to Europe before taking up residence in Florence. After the Battle of Marengo, he moved to Naples and from there assisted with the planning of the British counter-invasion of Egypt and travelled with the army as a logistical officer, witnessing the successful campaign and securing local sources of supplies from his contacts in the country. In May 1801, Baldwin returned to London and settled there, continuing his studies in magnetic theory, which by this time had been dismissed as pseudoscience. As a result, Baldwin was ridiculed and although he published a number of works on the subject in 1801 and 1802, he did not write again until 1811, when his research was privately printed. Personal life Portrait of his wife, Jane Maltass Baldwin by the workshop of Sir Joshua Reynolds, ca. 1782, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Shortly after one of his caravans in the Ottoman was attached in 1779 and he escaped to Izmir, he married Jane Maltass (1763‚Äì1839), the daughter of his agent and a famous society beauty. Although they had a daughter, the marriage was an unhappy one, punctuated by frequent arguments. While pausing in Vienna on their way to Britain, Jane was celebrated in society: a bust of her was made for Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor by Cerroschi and Count Wenzel Anton Kaunitz-Rietberg commissioned a full-length portrait. In London, she was painted by Joshua Reynolds, William Pyne and Richard Cosway. Baldwin became popular in society and became an acquaintance of William Blake, who mentions him in one of his poems. It was his friendship with Cosway that led to his introduction into the field of magnetic therapy, the theory that magnetic force had healing powers. He died in 1826 in Earl's Court and his art collection was sold at Christie's in 1828.

In 1893 Reynolds was at the centre of a drama that led to the passing of the Women's suffrage bill into law. Premier Seddon had expected to stop the bill in the upper house, but found that one more vote was needed. Thomas Kelly, a new Liberal Party councillor had left himself paired in favour of the measure, but Seddon obtained his consent by wire to change his vote. Seddon's manipulation so incensed two opposition councillors, Reynolds and Edward Cephas John Stevens that they changed sides and voted for the bill, allowing it to pass by 20 votes to 18 and so gave the vote to women.Women's Suffrage in New Zealand by Patricia Grimshaw, p 92.

EnBW deal  The public prosecutor's office in Stuttgart opened an investigation on 11 July 2012 against prime minister Stefan Mappus, several other ministers and Dirk Notheis, former head of Morgan Stanley Germany, in connection with the state's controversial purchase of a stake in utility Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg.Morgan Stanley executive investigated in Germany, KRGV.com, 12 July 2012 Morgan Stanley's German operations, headed by Notheis, in 2010 advised Baden- W√ºrttemberg on the purchase of a roughly 45% stake in EnBW from French state- controlled utility √âlectricit√© de France for nearly 4.7 billion euros (about $5.77 billion) valuing the asset at a multiple of 6x operating profits.

The transaction was signed four weeks after a decision by the German federal parliament to extend the maturities of existing nuclear power plants for another ten years on top of their existing license. Four months after the transaction, on 15 March 2011, the accident in a nuclear power plant in Fukushima/Japan happened, resulting in the decision by the Federal government to phase out nuclear generation, which adversely affected EnBW and its value. In addition to several fairness opinions as to the valuation of EnBW provided to the stakeholders at the time of the transaction, in total seven reviews over the EnBW share valuation were conducted over the process of the investigation. The dominating majority of reviews came to the conclusion that the price paid for the EnBW shares was fair.

Pussycat Theaters had 30 locations in California and were known for their cat-girl logo. To date, only one exists. History David F. Friedman and Dan Sonney founded Pussycat Theaters. Dan Sonney invented the name, based on Woody Allen film What's New Pussycat. Friedman has also cited the Pink Pussycat burlesque club on Santa Monica Boulevard as having previously established the word \\"pussycat\\" in relation to \\"pink\\" porn, since the early 1960s. The first Pussycat Theater opened in March 1966 on 444 South Hill Street, Los Angeles. Within two years, there were almost a dozen locations, from San Diego to San Francisco. In 1968, Vince Miranda bought a 50% share of the company. Miranda was unable to prevent those outside California from using the Pussycat name. Miranda spent $1 million to improve the decor of the theaters. They were known for being cleaner and fancier than other such places. The interiors featured red and gold carpeting, velveteen fixtures, beveled glass, mirror walls, chandeliers, oil paintings, murals, and merchandise bearing the Pussycat logo. Some Pussycat theaters sold popcorn from the box office to pedestrians on the sidewalk, with no obligation to buy a ticket. Vince Miranda and George Tate (who were lovers) shared ownership of Walnut Properties, the company that owned the Pussycat Theaters. Miranda may have had exclusive California license to show Deep Throat, a hugely lucrative film. His main competitors were the Mitchell brothers in San Francisco. Residents who lived near the theaters complained to the city governments that children could see the images of women on posters, ads, and cardboard stand- ups. Community members wanted the theaters to close. The citizens groups and government sued Walnut Properties under a variety of laws, including obscenity, public nuisance, rezoning, eminent domain, The Red Light Abatement Act, and the US Supreme Court's \\"preponderance\\" redefinition of porn theaters. Walnut Properties was served with over 100 civil lawsuits filed between 1973 and 2005. Between 1977 and 1994, at the Pussycat Theater in Santa Monica, \\"the Los Angeles Police Department made 2000 arrests for lewd conduct on the premises.\\" In 1981, an ordinance was passed banning adult movie theaters in Santa Monica. In 1983, pornographic videotape sales began to compete with adult theaters, reducing theater attendance. At the age of 52, Vince Miranda died of complications related to cancer in 1985. George Tate and his new paramour Jonathan Cota inherited Walnut and the Pussycat Theaters. The IRS imposed a federal tax lien of $6,047,760 on Miranda's estate. The theaters were losing money fast. Many theaters are given to debtors in lieu of money, and/or converted to general admission theaters. By 1990, fewer than 20 California Pussycats remained, and by 1992, only a dozen were still open. In 1994, Walnut Properties filed for bankruptcy, claiming liabilities of $17.7 million. George Tate spent all the money and died the same year. Jonathan Cota inherited Walnut and its debts. By 2003, all the theaters were lost except one at 7734 Santa Monica Boulevard. Filmmaker Roger Corman saved the last Pussycat Theater by brokering a deal with an unnamed buyer. In 2004, Cota threatened to file a lawsuit against the Pussycat Dolls, for trademark infringement on the Pussycat name. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office declared the Pussycat trademark to be \\"abandoned\\" and the case was dismissed. Today, Cota runs the last Pussycat Theater, which now shows homosexual pornography. The name was changed to the Tomkat, then to Studs.

A single prototype and five pre- production aircraft were built, but two crashed and the program was cancelled in favor of the Petlyakov Pe-2. Development The SPB (D) closely resembled the Polikarpov VIT-2, which had been recommended for production as a dive bomber, but the former actually was an entirely new design. It was smaller than the VIT-2 and had a monocoque fuselage. The main gears of the conventional undercarriage retracted aft into the rear of the engine nacelles and the tail wheel retracted into the rear fuselage. Two liquid-cooled Klimov M-105 V12 engines were slung underneath the wings.Gunston, p. 306 It retained its predecessor's prominent canopy and nose glazing, but reduced the armament to a single ShKAS machine gun for the bombardier/navigator while the rear gunner had a retractable Berezin UB dorsal gun and a ventral ShKAS to protect the aircraft's underside. The bomb bay could carry up to 800 kg (1,764 lbs) internally and an additional 700 kg (1,543 lbs) of bombs could be carried underneath the wings.Gordon, pp. 282‚Äì83 In addition to the SPB (D) prototype, five pre-production machines were ordered even before the prototype made its first flight. This flight, piloted by Boris Kudrin,Shavrov, chapter on Polikarpov's multi-role aircraft occurred safely on 18 February 1940, but on 27 April 1940 the first prototype crashed for unknown causes, killing test pilot Pavel Golovin. On 2 June 1940 test pilot Mikhail Lipkin barely survived when, landing with engines out, his SPB (D) clipped a parked Tupolev SB. On 30 June the second SPB (D) disintegrated in flight. Lipkin and flight engineer Bulychov, instructed to test wing flutter at an extreme 600-km/h (373-mph) diving speed, were killed in the crash; the aircraft actually disintegrated in horizontal flight. Investigators initially blamed the accident on Polikarpov's deputy Zhemchuzhin, who allegedly failed to fit the balance weights into the leading edges of the ailerons, causing wild flutter. Later they also blamed Lipkin, already dead, for the alleged reckless increase of speed. TsAGI engineers and airfield staff voiced suspicion that other factors could have been involved, but these were not examined at all. The third prototype, piloted by Kudrin, lost horizontal trim tab in flight; the pilot managed to land the plane but refused to fly on SPB (D) prototypes anymore. On 29 July 1940 the project was cancelled; tests required for proper crash examination were not completed. The government preferred to build twin-engined dive bombers on a simplified Petlyakov VI-100 platform, ‚Äì the conversion, named Petlyakov Pe-2, took over the roles originally intended for the SPB (D).Gordon, p. 283 Specifications  References Notes Bibliography * Gordon, Yefim.

Most members of staff stayed in Wales to help re-establish Siriol as an independent production company. The deal included all rights to current productions and a few older titles, but the rights to most of the older series are now held by Entertainment Rights. The company eventually employed over 40 people and was a developer of talent in the Welsh animation industry for more than 30 years. Calon continued working on animation production, but expanded into live-action content for both the UK and international markets, and to co-produce with major networks outside the UK.

Siriol Productions Siriol Productions (\\"Siriol\\" means 'cheerful' in Welsh language) was founded in 1982 by Mike Young, his wife Liz, animator Dave Edwards and producer Robin Lyons and based in Cardiff. The company was originally created when the three men approached the newly formed Welsh TV channel S4C and secured a commission to produce an animated series of SuperTed (which Mike Young created). With support from S4C, the partners set up an animation studio, Siriol Animation. SuperTed was a highly successful with the company winning a prestigious BAFTA award in 1987. The show first aired in 1982 and started airing on S4C in Wales and on the BBC elsewhere in the UK. It also ran for one season and 37 episodes. Following its success with SuperTed, the company was commissioned by S4C to produce another series called Wil Cwac Cwac which was based on a series of children's books that were first published in Wales in the early 1930s about a little duckling who is always naughty and lives in a farm village with his family and friends. This, in turn was followed by further commissions from S4C for half-hour specials created for the animated series Fox Tales. Lyons and Young have also been involved in working on a children's stop motion animated series, Fireman Sam in 1987, except it was produced by Prism Art and Design Ltd and Bumper Films. In its early years, the studio worked exclusively for S4C, and Robin Lyons (Managing Director) decided to broaden its customer base and to move into co-productions to form Siriol Productions in 1988. In 1989, Mike Young left the company and moved to the United States to set up his own company, Mike Young Productions. Young also teamed up with Hanna-Barbera to develop a cartoon called Fantastic Max (which was originally called Space Baby) and to create a sequel series to SuperTed entitled The Further Adventures of SuperTed. Moving into co-productions has proved successful for Siriol, resulting in productions such as The Princess and the Goblin an 80-minute film co-produced by Hungary's Pannonia Film Studio and Under Milk Wood, a 50-minute TV special using the 1950s voice recording by Richard Burton. These productions have enabled Robin Lyons to develop extensive contacts throughout the animation industry, both with broadcasters such as the BBC and ITV, and with other leading animation studios. In 1989, Siriol, together with three other animation studios in France, Germany and Belgium formed its own distribution company, EVA Entertainment, headed up by Steve Walsh, the former head of co-productions at Goldcrest Films. Its co- productions were grouped under the EC's CARTOON programme as part of its MEDIA initiative. EVA was the first grouping company established under this initiative. The group set up co-productions with major European broadcasters, typically with the BBC in the UK, FR3 and Canal+ in France and ZDF and WDR in Germany. It also made co-productions with other European partners as well as with US and Canadian co-producers. In 1995, EVA received a substantial private investment and attracted two top executives from BBC Children's International, Mikael Shields and Tony Stern. EVA Entertainment has made many series and specials, (the group's major productions were controlled creatively by Siriol) which were sold to over fifty different countries on five continents, including Robert Creep, Tales of the Tooth Fairies, Billy the Cat (the group's largest project) and Romuald the Reindeer. The later two programmes were produced by Robin Lyons. When EVA was sold to Pearson PLC, Siriol formed other alliances with Scottish Television and SKD Media Plc. In 1998, Siriol was brought over by Sleepy Kids (renamed Entertainment Rights in 2000), with Lyons expanding his role within the new company. In 2005, a management buyout led by Lyons took place for Siriol Productions, and was renamed Calon. Siriol set up two subdivisions. The first was Blunt Pictures, which produced animation aimed at older audiences. Blunt Pictures has produced a short film for Channel 4, Dee‚Äôs Dish Of The Day and developed the series, Stonehouse Reunion for Channel 4 and Days Of Deliverance for S4C. Blunt has also developed a low budget feature, 360, which has attracted funding from the Film Panel of the Welsh Lottery, and several web-based animation projects including Once Upon A Morgue and Deadenders. The second subdivision was a web design subdivision called Piczled, which has designed the official Basil Brush website and theme park attractions for Chessington World of Adventures in Surrey and Alton Towers in Staffordshire. Piczled has also worked on other websites such as those for Siriol and Entertainment Rights.

In Harlem, Manhattan, it begins at Riverside Drive on its western side and crosses Broadway, Amsterdam Avenue, and ends at Convent Avenue, before resuming on the eastern side, crossing Seventh Avenue, and ending at Lenox Avenue. In Port Morris in the Bronx, it runs from Bruckner Boulevard/St. Ann's Place to Locust Avenue. The block between Seventh Avenue and Lenox Avenues was once a thriving night spot, known as \\"Swing Street\\", with numerous cabarets, jazz clubs, and speakeasies. The street is described in modern times as \\"a quiet stretch of brownstones and tenement-style apartment houses, the kind of block that typifies this section of central Harlem\\".  History The street has historical significance during the Prohibition era when there were many speakeasies operating on the street and it was known as \\"Swing Street\\". The street also gained a reputation as \\"Jungle Alley\\" because of \\"inter-racial mingling\\" on the street. Harlem Riot of 1964 incident at the corner of 133rd Street and Seventh Avenue During the Jazz Age there were at least 20 jazz clubs on the street, mainly concentrated between Lenox Avenue (Malcolm X Boulevard) and Seventh Avenue, and a young Billie Holiday performed here and was discovered here at the age of 17. Holiday has cited 133rd Street as the original Swing Street, playing a major role in the development of African- American entertainment in Harlem and jazz. The Nest Club opened in 1923 when Melville Frazier and John Carey leased the building at 169 West 133rd Street and established the Barbecue Club on the main floor and The Nest on the downstairs floor, which opened on October 18, 1923. Jazz historian Frank Driggs described the club as having a \\"Chicago gangland atmosphere\\". Nightclubs of note include Tillie's Chicken Shack, known for torch singer Elmira, Bank's Club, Harry Hansberry's Clam House at 146 W. 133rd St., one of New York City's most notorious LGBT speakeasies established in 1928, featuring Gladys Bentley in a tuxedo singing \\"her own risque lyrics to popular songs\\", and Catagonia Club, better known as Pod's and Jerry's, which featured jazz pianist and composer Willie \\"The Lion\\" Smith. The street began to lose its attraction following the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, and the Harlem Riot of 1935 effectively killed the reputation of the street as a racial safe haven and most of the interracial clubs were forced to close. One of the last clubs to stay open was Pod's and Jerry's, which was renamed \\"The Log Cabin\\" in 1933, and stayed open until about 1948-9, long after 52nd Street had replaced 133rd Street as the \\"Swing street\\". Further racial violence broke out at 133rd Street and Seventh Avenue during the Harlem Riot of 1964. Landmarks New York Post printing building Numerous mills sprang up along the street on the eastern side but many of the former derelict buildings have been razed to the ground and new buildings erected. The New York Post has a printing centre here. On the western side is the Terence D. Tolbert Educational Complex and Roberto Clemente School, KIPP Infinity Charter School and the Manhattanville Bus Depot. The New York Structural Biology Center is situated in the Park Building at 89 Convent Avenue opposite the street. On the eastern side is Bethlehem Moriah Baptist Church and Bill's Place, a jazz club established in 2006 by tenor saxophonist Bill Saxton in a building which was the former speakeasy Tillie's Chicken Shack. Bishop R.C. Lawson once had a Bible book store on 133rd Street.

Diverging from the original snooker, rules for American snooker date back to at least 1925, and have been promulgated by the Billiard Congress of America (BCA) since the mid-20th century. The game is in decline, as the standardized international rules have largely supplanted it. American snooker has a simplified rule set compared to the international game, and is usually played on smaller tables. Depending upon equipment availability, the balls and may be larger than those for standard snooker, up to the size of pool balls and pockets. The United States Snooker Association is not connected with the game of American snooker, being the IBSF-recognized US governing body of standard-rules snooker. History American snooker made its first known in-print appearance in the 1925 edition of Brunswick‚ÄìBalke‚ÄìCollender Co.'s Rules Governing the Royal Game of Billiards, a rulebook given away by the company (with illustrations of their tables) as a promotional item. The previous edition, published in 1914, included snooker, but it was a summary of the original British version, as defined then by the Billiard Association of Great Britain and Ireland, whom the Brunswick booklet credited. The 1925 American version had a longer ruleset, opposite the situation today. Since at least as early as 1946, the Billiard Association of America (BAA), later the Billiard Congress of America (BCA), has published rules for American snooker in every edition of its near- annual rule book. The BCA describes the game as \\"a cousin of snooker as it is played broadly around the world, the regulations giving it a distinctive direction toward the configuration of many American pocket billiard games\\". Various rules are more in tune with pool-player expectations, such as no requirement to shoot away from an that is to the . No organized championship has been held in decades, and the game is principally of historical interest. The rules are sometimes used with American snooker balls on American pool tables as a loose approximation of snooker. Equipment American snooker often uses 54 mm ( inch) balls,Archived example from a retailer, January 18, 2005. but may use standard 52.5 mm (approx. in) balls. It is typically played on a table (and in private homes, often on even smaller tables), as full-size regulation British-style tables are rare in the United States, although they are legal for American snooker. Most serious players obtain proper snooker cues, though novices may settle for a thick-tipped pool cue. The game can easily be adapted informally to standard, large-pocketed pool tables, with snooker ball sets the same size as regular American pool balls (to compensate for the larger pool ); Saluc, for example, manufactures such a 57 mm ( inch) set, under their Aramith brand name.Archived copy of an example dating to May 13, 2008. American snooker sets often come with that are numbered with their values. Rules While American snooker shares many similarities to that of the modern international game of snooker, it has some differences. Foul shots are always awarded as a 7-point foul, as opposed to 4‚Äì7 depending on circumstances in the traditional game. Fouling can also occur if the cue makes contact with the table cloth, causing a 14-point foul. Colored balls must be pocketed cleanly, meaning that once the cue ball has struck them, they cannot make contact with any other ball before being pocketed, or it is a foul. As is more traditional with pool games, a is used in place of a coin flip at the beginning of the match, and also in the case of a black.

Oleg Sergeevich Prokofiev (; 14 December 1928, Paris ‚Äì 20 August 1998, Alderney) was an artist, sculptor and poet. Artistic life His career as an artist began at sixteen, attending the Moscow School of Art from 1944 to 1949. On completing his studies, Prokofiev worked in the studio of the painter Robert Falk, leaving in 1952 to work for the Institute of Art History in Moscow. There he studied and published his writing, specialising in the ancient arts of India and South- East Asia. As the second son of Sergei Prokofiev, he wrote that his father's music inspired in him ‚Äòa wave of some wonderful energy‚Ä¶a poetic or artistic impulse‚Äô.Taranova, Julia \\"Prokofiev's Russian and English Periods, Together\\", Moscow Times, 23 June 2010 . Retrieved 2 September 2014 During Prokofiev's lifetime he exhibited worldwide, including the UK, (Germany), Russia, France, and the US. As an artist, he was both excited about the future of Art as well as being remarkably informed about its history. During a visit to New York City in 1977, Prokofiev experienced the works of Rothko, Still, Motherwell, Barnett Newman, and Helen Frankenthaler, and these continued to influence his own work throughout the 1980s. He began creating organic constructivist sculptures, and over a short period of time his paintings also began to change. His brightly saturated line paintings and skyline sculptures of the 1980s demonstrate a definite departure from the greys, browns, and masking white works of the 1960s and early 70s. Oleg's late paintings are also strikingly atmospheric. They astonish both in their freedom of expression and their symbolic intensity whilst maintaining a strong sense of continuity within the artistic tradition of the 20th century. Since his death, his popular abstract compositions have been exhibited in the collection of the renowned Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. His work is also in the collections of the Lehmbruck Museum of Modern Sculpture, (Germany); the Zimmerli Art Museum, US; the Leeds City Art Gallery, UK; and the MART Museum, Italy. Personal life Born on 14 December 1928, from Sergei Prokofiev's first wife, Lina Llubera (the stage name of Carolina Codina). They lived in Paris until moving to Moscow, in 1935, at the age of seven. Oleg was first married to Sofia Koravina with whom he had a son, Sergei (1954‚Äì2014), who lived from 1985 in Germany and Switzerland with his wife Astrid and who, writing sub nom Sergei O. Prokofieff, wrote profound works in the field of Anthroposophy and, in general, Christian occultism. In Moscow he met a young English art historian, Camilla Gray. The publication of her ground breaking study of Russian avant- garde ‚ÄòGreat Experiment: Russian Art, 1863‚Äì1922‚Äô infuriated Soviet officials and Camilla and Oleg were not allowed to see each other for six years. Tragically, two years after they were eventually allowed to marry, Camilla died. From his second wife Oleg had a daughter, Anastasia.. Retrieved 1 September 2014 Oleg decided to move to the West, and from 1971 until his death in 1998 he lived in London. Oleg married Frances who gave him five children, one of whom, Quentin, died at an early age. Prokofiev lived with his family at Blackheath, South London.

It is served by the Digital Media City Station on Seoul Subway Line 6, AREX and Gyeongui Line. Residents of the Digital Media City are nicknamed Denizens (Digital Citizen) for their constant enthusiasm and interaction with high-tech digital technologies. The original advisors on the development include Dennis Frenchman and Michael Joroff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who also advised on the development of MediaCityUK in Salford, Greater Manchester, England, and Digital Mile in Zaragoza, Spain.https://www.realcomm.com/advisory/133/1/world-visionaries-attend-mits- new-century-cities-symposium History From 1978 to 1993, the currently developed area of the Digital Media City was in fact a massive landfill for Seoul's garbage on an island (at the time called Nanjido, now annexed into the mainland) in the Han River, before transforming into a high-tech modern city in the 21st century.A City of Tomorrow - Digital Media City , retrieved 2009-11-26 This dramatic turn-around is considered to be the result of the Miracle on the Han River, a term coined to describe Seoul's highly accelerated and successful development since the early 1960s. Used charcoal briquettes and other industrial waste materials produced during the city's rapid development in this period led to pile ups of trash. By the 1990s, these pile ups grew to mountains at a height of 95 meters and length of 2 kilometers, even after being compressed into a rectangular shape that weighed over 120 million tons. This was in comparison to the Namsan mountain in Seoul, which is 262 meters. Nanjido's accumulation of garbage increased to 3,000 truck loads of waste per day, essentially creating a pyramid 34 times larger than The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. In 1996, Seoul began to launch stabilization projects to withhold further industrial developments and build facilities to prevent the environmental contamination caused by the landfill zone. The stabilization projects included reinforcing the inclines of the landfill that were on the verge of collapsing, minimizing the sludge from the trash and collecting harmful gases. The gas accumulated in the process was utilized as the heat energy necessary for heating nearby facilities of the Seoul World Cup Stadium and the Sangam housing development area. The re-engineered region was first designated a housing development zone in March 1997. A \\"New Seoul Town Development\\" project was announced when Goh Kun became the mayor of Seoul in July 1998. In August of the same year, the general planning for New Seoul Town project began to take form. Based on this, a master plan was established for the Millennium City (Sangam New Millennium Town). Along with drawing up a city plan to turn the Sangam region into a secondary center of Seoul, a subsequent plan was drafted to build a gateway town that embodies both information and ecology. The plan has since been carried out in concrete, and encompasses separate projects such as the World Cup Park, an environmentally friendly housing complex and the Digital Media City. The Digital Media City is part of the larger Millennium City project in the Sangam-dong district of Seoul, 4 miles (7 km) from the central business district. Millennium City, conceived as a new town center, also encompasses the World Cup Soccer Park, a major transportation hub, and the restored Nanji-do landfill. The project's initial funding from the Seoul Metropolitan Government is being used to leverage the involvement of private technology partners and developers. The project was planned by the metropolitan government with the assistance of the Seoul Development Institute (SDI), a public think tank established by the City of Seoul, and is being implemented by the development arm of the City government. The Seoul Metropolitan Government provided the IT broadband and wireless networks that serve the area, constructed the infrastructure, and provided tax incentives and favorably-priced land for the most desirable tenants. These \\"magnet\\" tenants will attract other firms to the area, because of their business relationships or because their presence brands the area as a prestige location.

He is notable as the leader of the troops Napoleon sent to abduct Pius VII. Life Radet was born at Stenay in 1762. He joined the R√©giment de La Sarre as a soldier on 4 April 1780. He was promoted to corporal on 20 March 1781, and sergeant on 26 April 1782. Dismissed on 12 October 1786, he became a constabulary's rider on 30 November of the same year. He was appointed as a general of brigade in 1800 by Napoleon Bonaparte, who gave him the chief command of all the Gendarmerie (armed police.) In 1809 he was ordered to Rome. In July of that year he arrested the Pope Pius VII in his palace and conducted him to Florence. He received the title of baron (1809), and became a general of division in 1813. In June 1815 he was appointed Grand Provost of the Gendarmerie (i.e. military police) accompanying the French army in Belgium during the Waterloo Campaign.https://www.frenchempire.net/biographies/radet/ He was present at Ligny and at the Battle of Waterloo itself, where in the evening of 18 June he was wounded.Radet, M√©moires du g√©n√©ral Radet, 339.

Green (born December 10, 1959) is an American genomics researcher who had significant, start-to-finish involvement in the Human Genome Project. He is the director of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a position he has held since 2009. Green is an ardent St. Louis Cardinals fan. Early life and education Born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, Green comes from a scientific family. His father, Maurice Green, Ph.D., was a virologist at St. Louis University School of Medicine, where he directed the Institute for Molecular Virology for over five decades. His brother, Michael Green, M.D., Ph.D., is a molecular biologist at the University of Massachusetts-Worcester, where he chairs the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Cancer Biology and is an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Green received his B.S. degree in bacteriology from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1981 and his M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from Washington University in 1987. During residency training in clinical pathology (laboratory medicine), he worked in the laboratory of Dr. Maynard Olson, where he launched his career in genomics research. Career In 1992, he was appointed Assistant Professor of Pathology and Genetics as well as a co-investigator in the Human Genome Center at Washington University. In 1994, he joined the newly established Intramural Research Program of the National Center for Human Genome Research, later renamed the National Human Genome Research Institute. Green has served as chief of the NHGRI Genome Technology Branch (1996-2009), director of the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (1997-2009), and NHGRI Scientific Director (2002-2009). He was appointed by Francis Collins to be NHGRI Director in 2009. Genomics research While directing an independent research program for almost two decades, Green worked to map, sequence and understand eukaryotic genomes. His work included significant involvement in the Human Genome Project. These efforts eventually blossomed into a program in comparative genomics that provided insights about genome structure, function and evolution. His laboratory also identified and characterized several human disease genes, including those implicated in certain forms of hereditary deafness, vascular disease and inherited peripheral neuropathy. NHGRI Director As NHGRI director, Dr. Green leads the Institute's research programs and other initiatives. Under his guidance, the Institute has completed two major cycles of strategic planning. The first effort yielded the highly cited 2011 NHGRI strategic plan, ‚ÄúCharting a course for genomic medicine from base pairs to bedside‚Äù the second will yield a new strategic plan in October 2020. These two strategic planning processes have guided an expansion of NHGRI‚Äôs research portfolio, highlights of which include the design and launch of major new programs to accelerate the application of genomics to medical care, to catalyze the growth of genomic data science, to continue efforts to unravel the functional complexities of the human genome, and to enhance the building of the genomics workforce of the future. Dr. Green has played a leadership role in developing many high-profile efforts relevant to genomics. These efforts include multiple NIH Common Fund Programs ‚Äì such as the Undiagnosed Diseases Network, Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa), and the Human Microbiome Project ‚Äì the Smithsonian-NHGRI exhibition Genome: Unlocking Life's Code, several trans-NIH data science initiatives, the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy, and the U.S. Precision Medicine Initiative and NIH All of Us Research Program. Honors Honors given to Green include a Helen Hay Whitney Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (1989-1990), a Lucille P. Markey Scholar Award in Biomedical Science (1990-1994), induction into the American Society for Clinical Investigation (2002), an Alumni Achievement Award from Washington University School of Medicine (2005), induction into the Association of American Physicians (2007), a Distinguished Alumni Award from Washington University (2010), the Cotlove Lectureship Award from the Academy of Clinical Laboratory Physicians and Scientists (2011), a Ladue Horton Watkins High School Distinguished Alumni Award (2012), and the Wallace H.

It is a cortical-like nucleus of the amygdaloid complex. Though considered a nucleus, the periamygdalar area is more commonly associated with cortex due to its layered structure and location on the outer surface of the brain. The periamygdaloid cortex is located on the dorsal surface of the brain bordered by the piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex, periamygdalar claustrum, and anterior amygdaloid area. Its ventromedial and dorsolateral borders are defined by the first myelin bundle of the external capsule, while its remaining borders show no myelinated fiber projections or inputs as well as a higher density of acetylcholinesterase and cholinergic synapses than the neighboring anterior amygdaloid area. The periamygdaloid cortex plays a role in olfaction, and recent studies have shown that it may be involved in many more processes including opiate addiction, assessment of negative emotions, and depression. Additionally, it has been suggested that the left periamygdalar region may play a role in yawning.  Olfactory System  The periamygdaloid cortex is part of the primary olfactory cortex which receives input from the olfactory bulbs via the lateral olfactory tract.Zelano, C. M. (2007). The role of human primary olfactory cortex in olfactory processing. University of California, Berkeley. Along with the amygdala, the periamygdaloid cortex conducts cognitive evaluation of the olfactory input it receives and projects it back to the olfactory bulbs.  Addiction and Depression  A study of prodynorphin in the periamygdaloid cortex of humans with heroin addiction found that prodynorphin levels were significantly reduced. Further tests were run to determine the link of heroin metabolites to the prodynorphin to rule out ambiguity, but these tests led researchers to confirm that these decreases in prodynorphin were due to chronic heroin use and not a secondary factor. The mRNA-prodynorphin expression of rats undergoing heroin self-administration showed similar results which, paired with tests of affect, indicate that prodynorphin expression in the periamygdaloid cortex of rats correlates with negative affect. With the rat model results in mind, the study's results suggest that human opiate addicts have a lessened ability to manage negative affect due to the effects of heroin on the periamygdaloid cortex. Similar to its proposed mechanism of action in heroin addiction, prodynorphin in the periamygdaloid cortex has been shown to be significantly decreased in Major Depressive Disorder sufferers. This further implicates prodynorphin in the control of negative affect in humans and thus suggests that the periamygdaloid cortex is partially responsible for affect in humans.  Negative Emotion Assessment  The activity of various brain regions were assessed during exposure-recognition tasks of static and dynamic facial expressions of anger and happiness. Both the left and right periamygdaloid cortex voxels studied showed differential activation when the subject was tasked with recognizing dynamic expressions of anger compared to neutral, control expressions. This was not observed in static expressions of anger or in any expressions of happiness. These results suggest that the periamygdaloid cortex may be partially responsible for interpreting facial expressions and body language that indicate anger. This demonstrated involvement of the periamygdaloid cortex in dynamic anger assessment adds to the discoveries in more recent research linking the periamygdaloid cortex with prodynorphin expression.

Later, General Felix Murga, chief of police forces in Peru, had to take leave from his job when Peruvian ministries reported that the whole story was a hoax. The hoax was apparently passed on to prevent further investigations on extrajudicial killings by police forces. Details of the hoax According to the police, the first suspected gang member, Serapio Marcos, was arrested on November 3, 2009. Three others, Elmer Segundo Castillejos Aguero, Enedina Estela Claudio and ring leader Hilario Cudena Simon, were arrested on November 20. The gang was given the name for the mythological figure, the Pishtaco. The police claimed that the suspects told them that they sold the fat at a price of $15,000 per liter, but medical experts cast doubt on that, saying that so much body fat is extracted in routine medical procedures such as liposuction, that there should not be such a high demand for it. The story was that the gang members severed victims' heads, arms and legs, removed organs and suspend torsos from hooks above candles, which warmed the flesh as the fat dripped into tubs below. Peruvian police also claimed that they were searching for six additional members of the gang.

It ranges in age from Bathonian to Callovian, the uppermost part of the Middle Jurassic. Dinosaur remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation, although none have yet been referred to a specific genus.Weishampel, et al. (2004). \\"Dinosaur distribution.\\" Pp. 517-607. The name Cornbrash is an old English agricultural name applied in Wiltshire to a variety of loose rubble or brash which, in that part of the country, forms a good soil for growing corn. The name was adopted by William Smith for a thin band of shelly limestone which, in the south of England, breaks up in the manner indicated. Although only a thin group of rocks (10-25 feet c. 3-7 m), it is remarkably persistent; it may be traced from Weymouth to the Yorkshire coast, but in north Lincolnshire it is very thin, and probably dies out in the neighborhood of the Humber. It appears again, however, as a thin bed in Gristhorpe Bay, Cayton Bay, Wheatcroft, Newton Dale and Langdale. In the inland exposures in Yorkshire it is difficult to follow on account of its thinness, and the fact that it passes up into dark shales in many places the so-called clays of the Cornbrash, with Avicula echinata. The Cornbrash is of little value for building or road-making, although it is used locally; in the south of England it is not oolitic, but in Yorkshire it is a rubbly, marly, frequently ironshot oolitic limestone. In Bedfordshire it has been termed the Bedford limestone. Fossils The Cornbrash is a very fossiliferous formation; the fauna indicates a transition from the Lower to the Middle Oolites, though it is probably more nearly related to that of the beds above than to those below. Good localities for fossils are Radipole near Weymouth, Closworth, Wincanton, Trowbridge, Cirencester, Witney, Peterborough and Sudbrook Park near Lincoln. A few of the important fossils are: Waldheimia lagenalis, Pecten levis, Avicula echinata, Ostrea fiabelloides, Mycicites decurtatus, Echinobrissus clunicularis. Macrocephalites macrocephalus is abundant in the midland counties but rarer in the south; belemnites are not known. Indeterminate stegosaurian dinosaur material (sometimes known under the nomen nudum \\"Eoplophysis\\") have been discovered in this formation.

The Monster Men is a 1913 science fiction novel by American author Edgar Rice Burroughs, written under the working title \\"Number Thirteen\\". It first appeared in print under the title of \\"A Man Without a Soul\\" in the November, 1913 issue of All-Story Magazine, and was first published in book form in hardcover by A. C. McClurg in March, 1929 under the present title. It has been reissued a number of times since by various publishers. The first paperback edition was issued by Ace Books in February 1963. Plot summary Cornell University professor Arthur Maxon, who has been experimenting in the creation of artificial life, travels with his daughter Virginia to one of the remote Pamarung Islands in the East Indies to pursue his project. Their departure is noted with interest by a young man, Townsend J. Harper, Jr., who is quite taken with Virginia and determines to find out where they are going. In Singapore, Maxon commissions Dr. Carl von Horn to take them the remainder of the way to their destination in his yacht the Ithaca, and then to assist him in his experiments. On the island the group fights off a pirate attack and builds a fort. Maxon and von Horn begin their experiments, growing several living creatures in chemical vats, humanoid but mindless and ugly. Maxon hopes Experiment Number Thirteen will result in a perfect human being, and in his fanatic obsession plans to wed Virginia to this ultimate creation. Von Horn retains a more realistic viewpoint and hopes to marry her himself, leading to friction. Meanwhile, locals including Budadreen, one of von Horn's crewmen, and Muda Saffir, leader of the pirates, conspire against the scientists, who they believe are hiding treasure. They are watched closely by Chinese cook Sing Lee, who recognizes the pirate. Experiment Number Thirteen indeed appears to result in a physically perfect man, but as soon as the scientists discover this an emergency distracts them. Experiment Number One has escaped and abducted Virginia. Maxon, von Horn and Sing Lee pursue the monster, only to find it dead at the hands of Number Thirteen, also escaped from the lab in the wake of the scientists‚Äô departure. Thinking Virginia still in danger, von Horn attacks the creature and is nearly killed himself, but is spared by Thirteen when Virginia pleads for his life. Ignorant of the handsome stranger's origin, the girl finds herself attracted to him. Maxon and von Horn return Thirteen to the lab and begin educating him. Von Horn privately discloses to Virginia Maxon's plan to wed her to one of his creatures, while concealing it is her rescuer to whom she is to be wed. Separately, he informs Thirteen of his artificial origin. Both recipients of his confidences are horrified. Thirteen, or Jack, as he is now called, is convinced that he is a soulless monster and that Maxon must be stopped. Von Horn absconds with Virginia while Jack goes to confront Maxon, while Budadreen and six crewmen steal a chest they believe holds Maxon's wealth. Muda Saffir's pirates attack the compound and appropriate the chest. Jack, reconsidering his rage, defends Maxon and Sing Lee against the pirates. Virginia rebuff's von Horn's advances and falls in with Budadreen, who takes her captive and sails off in von Horn's yacht. Von Horn, since his effort to turn Jack against Maxon has failed, releases the other eleven monsters against them. Jack overawes the creatures and gains control of them, but Maxon, apparently regaining his sanity, turns on him and drives him away. The Ithaca is wrecked in a gale, and Budadreen and his men swept overboard; later the drifting hulk is boarded by headhunters. Jack and the eleven monsters search for Virginia and find the yacht in the harbor, when it is boarded by Muda Saffir's pirates, the monsters attack them. Saffir takes Virginia and flees the battle in his prahu; the monsters, capturing another prahu, pursue them. Having witnessed these events from hiding, von Horn returns to Maxon, who offers him his fortune and Virginia if he can save her. Jack and his monsters overtake and fight the pirates in Borneo, resulting in six monsters and many of the pirates killed, but Saffir, still holding Virginia, escapes up river in his boat. The monsters join with Barunda and a crew of captive Dayaks and resume pursuit. Meanwhile, Saffir has bungled a rape attempt against Virginia and been shoved overboard by her; his lieutenant Ninaka assumes command. He stops at a native village, hides the chest and Virginia, and when Jack arrives conspires with Barunda to have the natives lead him astray. He then recovers his contraband and continues up river; Virginia ultimately escapes by diving off the boat. Meanwhile, Von Horn, Maxon and Sing Lee sail to Borneo, encounter the Ithaca, and enlist the Dayaks to take them to Muda Saffir. The latter, having survived his dip in the drink, flags them down. He and von Horn make a secret deal and continue up river without Maxon, who is stricken with fever. Jack's band, lost, encounters an orangutan band after fighting off more Dayaks. Finding one of them has captured Virginia, they fight the apes. Von Horn, Muda Saffir and a group of native warriors happen on the battle and spirit off the unconscious Virginia; Sing Lee, following, sees all. Von Horn's group and Sing Lee go back to Maxon, who is recovering. Von Horn presses his suit with Virginia. Ninaka and Barunda fall out; Barunda is murdered, but this drives Ninaka ashore. Ninaka buries the chest lest it encumber his escape. Von Horn and a couple of Dayaks, returned from delivering Virginia to her father, witness this. Afterwards von Horn kills his companions to keep the secret of the treasure to himself and flees back down river, narrowly missing Muda Saffir heading the other way with two war prahus; Saffir has again abducted Virginia. She escapes again and falls in with Jack and his surviving monsters; spotted by the pirates, they flee, one of the monsters dying to cover the retreat while Jack carries Virginia to safety. Making his stand in a small canyon, he casts boulders down on their pursuers until they retreat. He promises the girl he will take her back to her father, but soon after is stricken with a fever. She tends him in his delirium. Maxon, von Horn, and Sing Lee search for Virginia, and come across the two just as Jack's fever breaks. Von Horn shoots Jack, but Sing Lee disarms him, stopping him from finishing him off. Von Horn finally reveals to Virginia that Jack is Number Thirteen, but she decides she loves Jack regardless. Then Sing Lee declares Jack is not a monster after all, but an amnesiac he had found drifting in a lifeboat and substituted for Maxon's failed experiment. He then exposes the crimes of von Horn, who flees into the jungle. An American naval vessel arrives; it turns out to be seeking von Horn, a deserter, to arrest him. The pursuit finally ends at the site of the buried \\"treasure\\", which von Horn has dug up; his headless body is found next to the opened chest. It had contained books, not treasure, and von Horn's native accomplices were evidently upset. The Maxons and Jack leave Borneo on the navy ship, and Jack's memory returns. He is conveniently revealed as Townsend Harper, the wealthy (and single) young man who took an interest in Virginia at the beginning of the book. Wedding bells are plainly not far off. Critical reception Galaxy columnist Floyd C. Gale, discussing the 1963 reprints, said that \\"although this book suffers from some of Burroughs's worst writing, there is still a lot of excitement in his tale\\".

It was established in 1974 as the Youth Research Unit (Unit Penyelidikan Belia) under the Youth Ministry, but was renamed and transferred in 1981. BTN's stated objective is to nurture the spirit of patriotism and commitment to excellence among Malaysians, and train leaders and future leaders to support the nation's development efforts. BTN's programmes are controversial, and many accuse them of explicitly promoting ketuanan Melayu and the former governing coalition Barisan Nasional (BN). On 25 November 2009, the Selangor state government issued a ban prohibiting state civil servants, employees of state subsidiaries, and students at state-owned institutions from attending BTN courses. On 2 December 2009, the Penang state government followed suit and banned all state civil servants from attending the controversial courses. On 13 August 2018, Youth and Sports Minister Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman from the new federal government under Pakatan Harapan (PH) announced that the BTN and National Service Training Programme (PLKN) were abolished.Syed Saddiq: BTN and National Service are abolishedSyed Saddiq: BTN, National Service abolished Allegations of racism Although BTN has been the subject of various allegations over the years, in late 2009, it became the subject of greater controversy, when many allegations of racism and political propaganda appeared in quick succession. One BTN alumnus claimed that he was \\"taught a song with lyrics like 'the land that you walk upon is owned by others'. Lecturers told us the Malays were forced to depend on the Chinese for support after 1998 because some Malays had betrayed their own race,\\" in reference to Malays voting against the Barisan Nasional in 1999 general election. Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad, another alumnus and assemblyman for Seri Setia in the State Legislative Assembly of Selangor, claimed that the BTN camp he attended was \\"racial and political in nature,\\" with trainers telling attendees that Malays require affirmative action and criticising the opposition Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) as \\"deviationist\\". Amirudin Shari, assemblyman for Batu Caves, claimed that \\"participants are indoctrinated with propaganda about 'Ketuanan Melayu' and external threats\\". Another alumnus claims he was taught that the Chinese were \\"the Jews of Asia,\\" and part of a conspiracy to topple the government. Another alumnus alleged she was \\"told that the Malays were the most supreme race in the world, we were God's chosen few, that the others were insignificant. We were warned about certain elements in our society and abroad, determined to undermine Malay excellence.\\" On 21 November 2009, Nik Nazmi, Amirudin and five other Pakatan Rakyat state assemblymen asked the Selangor government to stop requiring students at its universities and colleges to attend BTN courses. After the Selangor government issued a ban prohibiting state employees and students at state institutions from attending BTN programmes, the State Executive Councillor for Education, Dr. Halimah Ali, described the courses as \\"indoctrination by the Barisan Nasional government\\" and said, \\"the courses promote racism and my own children who have attended BTN have been given booklets that encourage hate towards the opposition.\\" In September 2010, BTN deputy director Hamim Husin was reported for referring Chinese as Si mata pepet (the slant-eyed) and Indians as Si botol (the drinkers) during a closed-door function of Puteri UMNO (Women youth wing of United Malays National Organisation) delegates. In November 2010, Minister in Prime Minister's department Nazri Aziz reported that the deputy director has been suspended from duty since October 2010 and a warning letter has been issued. However, the duration of suspension was not disclosed. Response by the Malaysian government The Malaysian Insider reported in November 2009 that in response to brewing controversy, the Cabinet had discussed the need to revamp BTN. Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Idris Jala arranged a briefing for the Cabinet on the effects of BTN programmes, and the meeting concluded with the Prime Minister reportedly saying, \\"This must end.\\" In an editorial, the publication said: \\"The Malaysian Insider understands that there are moves within the administration to dilute the syllabus of BTN courses, as a compromise. But such half-measures are not likely to be enough if Najib is serious about reversing what many Malaysians see as institutionalised racism.\\" Former Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin defended BTN, saying its programmes inculcate nationalism and unity among Malaysians in line with the Prime Minister's 1Malaysia concept. Subsequently, Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Ahmad Maslan said \\"knowledge and information ... presented at these courses are based on historical facts and data ... collected from various agencies and ... experts\\" and are consistent with 1Malaysia. Ahmad, who is also head of the BTN, denied allegations that it was systemically racist: \\"Out of the 1,000 lectures given, maybe only one minute the lecturer had a slip-up so it is unfair that you portray BTN as racist just for that.\\" Describing typical course contents, he said participants \\"are taught about the Federal Constitution, the social contract, the position of the Malays in this country and 60 per cent of the population are the bumiputras.\\" Although Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Nazri Aziz previously told the press that the Cabinet had ordered a revamp of BTN courses to eliminate elements inconsistent with 1Malaysia, Ahmad denied this, saying that Cabinet merely wanted an \\"upgrade\\" as opposed to a \\"revamp\\". Responding, Nazri insisted that \\"Whatever word you use, upgrade or revamp ... to me, it is a change of module. Datuk Ahmad Masalan is a member of the Cabinet, he can‚Äôt dispute my statement.\\" Nazri also criticised the denial of allegations against BTN, saying that opposition members who had previously been in government like Leader of the Opposition Anwar Ibrahim \\"know, so what is there to deny?\\" and said that BTN had been used to promote certain political leaders. Mahathir's involvement in BTN Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad defended BTN as meant to inculcate the values of discipline and hard work in public servants and scholars: \\"What we tried to teach them is that they should have new values, new culture...because the culture and the value-system they have is not conducive to success. If they want to serve the government well, they must accept and practice a certain value system.\\" The ruling party-owned Utusan Malaysia newspaper criticised the decision to change the BTN curriculum, claiming Nazri was acting on his own and urging the government not to \\"bow down\\" to the opposition. In response, Nazri branded Mahathir's statement \\"bloody racist,\\" criticising both him and Utusan Malaysia for denying the allegations against BTN: Nazri denied that criticism from Pakatan Rakyat or the Selangor government decision were reasons for the Cabinet decision, saying: \\"...courses run by BTN using public funds must be used properly and it amounts to millions so if you want to talk about patriotism, patriotism for all, not just the Malays, for all Malaysians. It's not because of the Selangor state government that we changed the syllabus so it's long before that.\\" In response, Mahathir accused Nazri of hypocrisy, saying \\"I must be a racist if Nazri says I am racist. Don't ever say that I am not. He knows everything. He belongs to a party which is racist... which is Umno. ... Umno is a party perkauman [racism] and is meant only for Malays and nobody [else] can join. So he (Nazri) is in a racist party but says he is against racism. So he should resign from the party.\\" Mahathir is a former President of Umno, and was still a member of it and the time of making the statement. Koh Tsu Koon, another Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, defended Nazri, saying perhaps Mahathir was unaware of the nature of BTN's curriculum: \\"[R]ecent feedback from participants since last year showed that the BTN course has diverted from its earlier version. Participants, including JPA [Public Services Department] scholars, felt very upset and disheartened.\\" Former BTN director and Member of Parliament for Sungai Petani, Johari Abdul then alleged that Mahathir was responsible for changes in the BTN programme, saying that under Mahathir, BTN courses emphasised propaganda supportive of the ruling party, making claims such as \\"If the Umno-BN government falls, then ... the Malays would be enslaved in their own country.\\" Other Members of Parliament, such as deputy chair of the Barisan Nasional Backbenchers Club and MP for Kinabatangan, Bung Mokhtar Radin, argued that BTN still served a useful purpose: \\"I don't see it as racist. It is one of the government agencies that have taught society the characteristics of a great nation and understand the real Malaysia. BTN has also played a role since independence towards strengthening racial harmony in this country. So I really regret the actions by Pakatan state governments to prohibit the activities by BTN because BTN has never had the intention to weaken any party members but it is a platform for the public to gain knowledge.\\" Leaked presentation slides  From 11 March 2015 until 15 June 2015, BTN had published a series of presentation slides which was available on its official website. One of the presentation slides had claimed Malay independent publishers to be \\"anti-establishment\\", in which their \\"movement without supervision from the authorities\\" will \\"bring a negative effect on the government\\" and giving birth to \\"new icons of the young generation that spread extreme and free ideas\\". The slide had also recommended that government officials ban any books having \\"explicit and free\\" content produced by them. This has raised ire from the publishers, who had collectively made a media statement demanding a public apology from the agency. Following the incident, BTN decided to take down all the controversial slides from its website while maintaining that the content of the slides were meant for \\"academic discussion\\" only. Other slides published by the agency included a slide that examined the performance of the Barisan Nasional (BN) ruling coalition from 1959 to 2014 with racial breakdown of popular votes towards BN and Pakatan Rakyat (PR) seats and also percentages of Muslim and non-Muslim member of parliament (MPs) in Parliament of Malaysia. Another slide had accused Chinese newspapers of being \\"fine needles that penetrate the government whilst promoting opposition movements.\\" The national opposition party Democratic Action Party (DAP) is accused of using several Malay leaders to purportedly \\"destroy the Malay community\\". DAP was also accused in the slide of controlling the minds of people from Sabah and Sarawak by invoking the issue of the use of the name \\"Allah\\" in the context of local Christian presses, and inciting separation of both states from Malaysia. The slide also claimed that a change in the current government will cause \\"political instability\\" in the country, bringing up comparisons with the Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge regime. Another slide presents a breakdown of a list of the 10 richest men in Malaysia, where most of them are Chinese, and also the situation of Christians \\"being allowed to build large churches despite only accounting for 9.1% of the total population in Malaysia\\". It also argued that \\"racism can unite a nation or race\\", whereas the racial minorities in Malaysia \\"already have their needs fulfilled as entitled under international human rights laws\\".  Abolishment  In August 2018, Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman, the Youth and Sports Minister of Malaysia announced that the National Civics Bureau will be abolished with immediate effect. The decision to scrap the BTN programme was made during two successive Cabinet meetings, because evidence shown that the programme was misused to spread misguided indoctrination. The staff and resources under the National Civics Bureau programme will be reassigned to work in other ministries of the Malaysian government.

African Americans have served the U.S. military in every war the U.S has fought. Formalized discrimination against black people who have served in the U.S. military lasted from its creation during the Revolutionary War to the end of segregation by President Harry S. Truman's Executive Order 9981 in 1948. Although desegregation within the U.S. military was legally established with President Truman's executive order, full integration of African-American servicemen was not established until 1950 for the U.S Navy and U.S. Air Force and not until 1953 for the U.S Army.  Revolutionary War  African-Americans served on both sides of the war in the capacity of both fighting men and slaves. While the northern states had opened up their state militias to freed slaves, it was forbidden in the south to arm slaves as the southern planters feared the worst from their former slaves. The Royal Governor of Virginia, John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, issued an emancipation proclamation in November 1775, promising freedom to runaway slaves who fought for the British. Sir Henry Clinton, Commander in Chief of British forces, issued a similar edict in New York in 1779. Over 100,000 slaves escaped to the British lines; with several units such as the Ethiopian Regiment consisting entirely of black men. The former slaves were promised freedom, and eventually evacuated to Upper Canada after the conclusion of the war. In response, George Washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776. All-black units were formed in Rhode Island and Massachusetts and many of those enrolled were slaves promised freedom for serving. At least 5,000 African-American soldiers fought as revolutionaries, while at least 20,000 served with the British.  War of 1812  While the Army remained primarily white, a substantial minority of the sailors in the U.S. Navy were black. In fact, during the Battle of Lake Erie African-Americans made up about one- quarter of the personnel in the American naval squadrons. While they served faithfully in the Navy, they were not allowed to serve in the Army. However naval service was often unpopular and to get sufficient seamen on occasion various shipyard commandants employed slaves as seamen. In his 12 July 1809 letter to the Secretary of the Navy, Commodore Thomas Tingey confirms this practice. Tingey had requested permission to employ up to 20 good slaves in the ordinary. His deputy John Cassin further elaborated, \\"Sometime past we are so much reduced as not able to man a boat or even to wash the decks of one of the ships. As seaman are not to obtained at the present wages, I therefore suggest to you the propriety of employing a few slaves‚Ä¶ as I think they will ‚Ä¶answer for many of our purposes as Seaman.\\"John G. Sharp The Washington Navy Yard Strike and \\"Snow Riot\\" of 1835 2019 http://www.usgwarchives.net/va/portsmouth/shipyard/washingtonsy.html Numerous enslaved African Americans were listed naval shipyard as \\"Landsman\\" or \\"Ordinary\\" Seaman. On 6 December 1845 Commodore Jesse Wilkinson Commandant of the Gosport Navy Yard confirmed this long standing practice to the Secretary of the Navy, George Bancroft \\"that a majority of them [blacks] are negro slaves, and that a large portion of those employed in the Ordinary for many years, have been of that description, but by what authority I am unable to say as nothing can be found in the records of my office on the subject ‚Äì These men have been examined by the Surgeon of the Yard and regularly Shipped [enlisted] for twelve months\\"Wilkinson to Bancroft 6 December 1845 NARA M125 \\"Captains Letters\\" Letter Received from Captains 1805 -1885, 1 Nov 1845 ‚Äì 31 Dec 1845, dated 6 Dec 1845, letter number 84, 1-2John G.M. Sharp List of Gosport Navy Yard Employees Military and Civilian, 1846 http://www.usgwarchives.net/va/portsmouth/shipyard/nnysharp13.html This subterfuge continued until the Civil War. The law of 1792, which generally prohibited enlistment of blacks in the Army, became the United States Army's official policy until 1862. Due to its chronic shortage of personnel, the Navy never bothered with any restrictions on the enlistment of African-Americans.  Civil War  The Civil War was no doubt the pivotal moment in deciding the fate of African-Americans. A Union victory would mean a swift end to the institution of slavery. A victory for the Confederacy would continue the institution. From the beginning the war was motivated in the South to secede into a separate nation to preserve slavery, which was legal in and crucial to the economies of every Confederate state; in the North, the war was primarily to preserve the union of the United States of America which the Confederate States aimed to abandon, while also abolishing slavery everywhere in the union and preventing slavery's spread to new states and territories in the West. The enlistment of blacks on either side was unheard of outside of state militias until 17 July 1862; Congress passed two acts allowing the enlistment of African-Americans. However, official enrollment occurred only after September 1862. From the moment they donned the uniforms of the Union, African-Americans proved themselves to be invaluable troops; they exceeded all expectations. At first, however, they were not employed on the battlefield; instead, they were used as labor. Initially, many, though not all, white soldiers and officers believed that black men lacked the ability to fight well. Union Gen. John C. Fr√©mont in Missouri and Union Gen. David Hunter of South Carolina, both white, issued proclamations that emancipated slaves in their regions be permitted to enlist at the start of the war, but these orders were immediately rescinded by their superiors. In the North, black freedmen who rushed to join the Union Army were refused due to a 1792 law barring African-Americans from enlisting. These laws were rescinded in the North by the Militia Act of 1862, and ultimately by Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/blacks-civil-war African-American soldiers of the 1st Kansas Colored Volunteers silenced their critics by repulsing attacking Confederate guerrillas at the skirmish at Island Mound, Missouri in October 1862. Although black soldiers proved themselves as reputable soldiers, discrimination in pay and other areas remained widespread. According to the Militia Act of 1862, soldiers of African descent were to receive $10.00 a month, with an optional deduction for clothing at $3.00. In contrast, white privates received $13.00 per month plus a clothing allowance of $3.50. In early June 1864, Private Sylvester Ray of the 2nd U.S. Colored Cavalry was recommended for trial because he refused to accept pay inferior to that of white soldiers. First Lieutenant Edwin Hughes of the 2nd U.S. Colored Cavalry, recorded Private Ray as stating, \\". . . none of us will sign again for seven dollars a month. . . .\\" Later that month, Congress granted equal pay to the U.S. Colored troops and made the action retroactive. Following the Civil War, an effort was made to allow blacks to attend the United States Naval Academy. John H. Conyers of South Carolina was nominated by South Carolina congressman Robert Elliota and became a midshipman on 21 September 1872. During his first year at the academy, Conyers was subject to severe, ongoing hazing, including verbal torment, shunning, and beatings. His classmates even attempted to drown him, among other abuses. Conyers finally yielded to the chronic academic, physical, and mental haranguing and resigned in October 1873. Philippine-American War After the Treaty of Paris, the islands of the Philippines became a colony of the United States. When the U.S. Military started to send soldiers into the islands, most of the native population who had already been fighting their former Spanish rulers, opposed U.S. colonization and retaliated, causing an insurrection. In what would be known as the Philippine-American War, the U.S. Military also sent colored regiments and units to stop the insurrection. However, due to the discrimination of African-American soldiers, many of them defected to the Philippine Army. One of those who defected was David Fagen, who was given the rank of Captain in the Philippine Army. Fagen served in the 24th Regiment of the U.S. Army, but on 17 November 1899, he defected to the Filipino army.Rudy Rimando, \\"Interview with Historical Novelist William Schroder: Before Iraq, There Was the Philippines\\", 28 November 2004, History news Network. He became a successful guerrilla leader and his capture became an obsession to the U.S. military and American public. His defection was likely the result of differential treatment by American occupational forces toward black soldiers, as well as common American forces derogatory treatment and views of the Filipino occupational resistance, who were frequently referred to as \\"niggers\\" and \\"gugus\\". After two other black deserters were captured and executed, President Theodore Roosevelt announced he would stop executing captured deserters. As the war ended, the US gave amnesties to most of their opponents. A substantial reward was offered for Fagen, who was considered a traitor. There are two conflicting versions of his fate: one is that his was the partially decomposed head for which the reward was claimed, the other is that he took a local wife and lived peacefully in the mountains.The Saga of David Fagen Interwar period \\"The Navy's racial segregation policies limited African Americans' participation in World War I and, after the war, barred black enlistments altogether from 1919 to 1932. The only black sailors in uniform during that period were the ones aboard in 1919 who were allowed to stay to retire.\\" In 1932 Blacks were allowed to serve on US Navy ships as stewards and mess attendants.  World War II  During World War II, African- American enlistment was at an all-time high, with more than 1 million serving in the armed forces. However, the U.S. military was still entirely segregated. The marines had no black people enlisted in combat infantry. There were black people in the Navy Seabees and the United States Army Air Corps all-white policy gave birth to the segregated all-black unit of the(Tuskegee Airmen), who trained and lived on a separate airfield and base but endured this in order to prove that African-Americans had what it took to fly military aircraft. http://tuskegeeairmen.org/ The army had only five African-American officers. In addition, no African-American would receive the Medal of Honor during the war, and their tasks in the war were largely reserved to noncombat units. Black soldiers had to sometimes give up their seats in trains to the Nazi prisoners of war. One example of African Americans receiving different treatment was the 17th Special Naval Construction Battalion and the 16th Marine Field Depot on the island of Peleliu, 15‚Äì18 September 1944. On D-Day the 7th Marines were in a situation where they did not have enough men to man the lines and get the wounded to safety. Coming to their aid were the 2 companies of the 16th Marine Field Depot(segregated) and the 17th Special Seabee(segregated). That night the Japanese mounted a counter-attack at 0200 hours. The Field Depot Marines are recorded as again having humped ammunition, to the front lines on the stretchers they brought the wounded back on and picked up rifles to become infantrymen. By the time it was over nearly the entire 17th CB had volunteered alongside them. The Seabee record states that besides hummping ammo and helping wounded they volunteered to man the line where the wounded had been, man 37mm that had lost their crews and volunteered for anything dangerous.

The youngest of five boys, his brothers were Marion, Earle, Jr., Keith, and Leland. His father owned a drug store where Richey worked. After serving in the Army Air Corps during World War II, he received his undergraduate degree from Washburn University in 1949 and a law degree from Washburn Law in 1951. In 1989, the school awarded him an honorary doctorate of commerce.

Linda is married to former Kansas Governor Bill Graves. The couple had six grandchildren.\\"Ronald K. Richey\\", Colorado Springs Gazette, viewed August 28, 2010. Available at http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/gazette/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&pid;=144962898 Career After graduating from Washburn in 1951, Richey served as an attorney with the Kansas Insurance Department and later as legislative manager for the American Mutual Insurance Alliance of Chicago, Illinois. In 1964, he joined Globe Life And Accident Insurance Company in Oklahoma City as vice president and general counsel. He was eventually elected chairman and chief executive officer and maintained that position until 1980. Globe Life was purchased by Torchmark Corporation (hereafter referred to as \\"Torchmark\\" or \\"The Company\\"), and in 1982 Richey was elected president of the Birmingham, Alabama-based Torchmark Corporation. On January 1, 1985, Richey was named president and chief executive officer of Torchmark Corporation. Under Richey‚Äôs leadership, Torchmark successfully integrated several of the companies it had spent more than half a billion dollars to acquire during a buying spree in the late 1970s and early 1980s. These acquisitions included Globe Life And Accident Insurance Company, Continental Investment Corporation, and United American Insurance Company. Continental owned Waddell & Reed and United Investors Life Insurance Company. While many other insurance providers were lured into the high-return, high-risk junk bond, and commercial real estate markets of the 1980s, Torchmark maintained three-fourths of its invested assets in reliable, government-guaranteed securities and short-term investments. When the bottom fell out of the junk bond and real estate markets in the late 1980s, Torchmark emerged unscathed. Torchmark's conservative investment strategies earned its primary subsidiaries the industry's highest ratings. The national scandals, however, did affect The Company, in the form of increased contributions to the federal guaranty fund to bail out insolvent insurers. The 1990s began promisingly for Torchmark, as 1992 marked The Company's forty-first consecutive year of growth. By then, its stock price had shot up an astronomical 1,675% from its 1980 levels. In 1994, however, The Company experienced some setbacks. In large part as a result of some poorly performing investments and the fallout from several different legal disputes in Alabama stemming from alleged misconduct by Agents at Liberty National Life Insurance Company, The Company's growth streak was snapped. Revenues declined to $1.9 billion from 1993's $2.2 billion and net income dropped $31 million from 1993's results, to $269 million. 1994 also saw some alterations in The Company's business balance as Torchmark made the strategic decision to focus more heavily on its life insurance operations at the expense of its health insurance ones (life insurance products tended to have higher operating margins, build better assets, and be under less year-to-year growth pressure). Buoyed by the acquisition of American Family Life Insurance Company for $552 million in November of that year, Torchmark's life insurance revenues jumped 16% from 1993's levels, while the health insurance sector contracted by 31.2% over the same period. The restructuring of 1994 helped stanch the decline in Torchmark's revenues, as 1995 sales climbed to $2.1 billion, recouping nearly all of the 1993-94 drop. Net income, however, declined nearly 47% from 1994 ($143 million) as a result of poor growth in the Medicare supplemental insurance sector along with The Company's litigation exposure, heavy debt burden from the American Family Life acquisition, and underperforming oil and gas investments. (The Medicare business had been slumping ever since federal legislation enacted in 1992 capped the commissions that vendors of such policies could charge.) To remedy this situation as best it could, Torchmark opted to divest itself of its holdings in the energy industry to streamline its operations and dedicate itself more effectively to its core insurance, mutual fund, and asset management businesses. In 1995, Torchmark liquidated its investments in Torch Energy Advisors, Inc., the Black Warrior coal mine, and its holdings in Nuevo Energy Co.fundinguniverse.com Company data and history adapted from history of Torchmark Corp. at Richey retired as CEO in March 1998 and chairman in 2002. Other activities and interests Richey was active in a number of industry and charitable activities. He was a former president of the Association of Oklahoma Life Insurance Companies, a former director of the American Council of Life and Health Insurance and board member for the National Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center. From 1982 to 1999 he was a trustee of the Washburn Endowment Association and later a trustee emeritus. He was also a former member of the Washburn Law board of governors. Richey and his wife were the benefactors of the Richey Scholars Program at Washburn, making them one of the university's most generous donors in its history. Around the time of his graduation from law school, Richey joined together with eight other Phi Delta Theta fraternity brothers to form the \\"Free Society of GNIP-GNOP.\\" For more than fifty years, this group has sponsored prizes for best note and comment at Washburn Law.

Born in Cavan, he won his fifth Men's Singles title in a row at the 2015 at Calgary, Canada. He defeated Killian Carroll from Cork in the final as the Irish dominated the singles with the four semi final berths taken by Irish players. His rivalry with Luis Moreno has been likened to the Federer‚ÄìNadal rivalry in tennis. Brady will likely attempt to achieve the record of 12 US National singles titles, which will take him to 2018 and just weeks short of his 39th birthday. Brady has stated he won't compete for his 6th World Handball Championship in 2018. Underage handball career Brady was introduced to the sport as a 12-year-old by Fr John Gilhooly, a teacher in St Patrick's College, Cavan. While he showed an early aptitude and won an All Ireland Feile title in 1993, Brady didn't win his first \\"full\\" All Ireland title until the age of 16, partnering Pauric Kiernan to the U16 doubles crown in 1995. In 1997, he defeated Meath's Carl Browne in an all-Irish 17 and Under final at the World Championships in Winnipeg, Canada. The win was a mild shock at the time, and marked Brady out as an outstanding prospect. The following year, Brady landed the prestigious Minor Singles title, defeating Dublin's Eoin Kennedy for the first time in a marathon final in Roscommon. Senior handball career Having won the minor title, the flesh title, Brady began to travel regularly to the US for tournaments. In June 1998, he won the US Nationals 19 and Under Singles in Los Angeles, won the Junior Nationals in the same age group the following December in Chicago, Illinois and won the title again the next June, this time in Baltimore, Maryland. At home, he advanced to intermediate ranks and won the All Ireland title at the first time of asking, defeating Eoin Kennedy in the semi-final and Kerry's Dominick Lynch in the final in Ballaghedereen, Co Roscommon. The following February, Brady again defeated Brad Alesi, this time in the final of the USHA Collegiates in Minneapolis, a tournament which draws the best college handballers in Ireland and North America and has come to be seen as a stepping stone to the professional ranks. That autumn, Brady made it to the last four of the World Championship Open Singles in Chicago, losing a heartbreaking 11-8 tiebreaker to top American John Bike. The stage seemed set for a major impact at senior level back at home but it took the Cavanman some time to adjust. A crop of dominant senior players, including Ducksy Walsh, Walter O'Connor and Tom Sheridan were coming to the end of their senior 40x20 careers at this time and with the emergence of young stars such as Brady, Kennedy, Carlow's Kenneth Kane and, most of all, Cork's Tony Healy, the senior scene was extremely competitive at this time. Brady would suffer a number of heartbreaking defeats ‚Äì games which he has often cited as being crucial to his later success ‚Äì before he finally made a senior breakthrough. He lost the All Ireland senior final, in a tiebreaker to Healy, the Irish Nationals final, the senior doubles final and the singles and doubles trials for the World Championships in 2000 and 2001. Healy, just a year older than Brady, became senior champion as soon as he graduated from intermediate and would win the title three times before he lost a senior championship match. He and Brady became close friends, as well as on-court rivals, and in 2001 the pair began to travel to the US in an attempt to break on to the USHA Pro Tour. At the time, no Irish player had ever qualified for the tour but Healy and Brady bucked the trend, reaching the final of a qualifying tournament in Atlanta in late 2001. Their first tournament on the circuit was in Peoira, Illinois and the pair would travel to Sacramento, Dallas, Juarez, South Bend, Modesto and Las Vegas up to June 2002, by which point Brady was beginning to assert himself as the top Irish player and a coming force on the world scene. In December 2002, two months after his 22nd birthday, he defeated top Californian Vince Munoz in the final of a pro stop in Milwaukee to become the first Irishman to win such an event, which was a massive milestone in the history of the sport and a turning point in Brady's career. He followed up with a first All Ireland senior title in March 2003, defeating Healy 21-6, 21-18 at O'Loughlin's, Kilkenny in the final, and added the doubles title with Michael Finnegan against Meath. In October of the year, he won the first of four World Open Singles titles, again defeating Healy in an epic match which is often referred to as the greatest game ever played. Suffering from cramp, Brady looked as if he may be forced to withdraw from the match but in a sporting gesture, Healy called several time-outs in succession and Brady was able to play on. He ultimately defeated Healy, effectively on one leg, in a tiebreaker, and added the doubles title, again with Finnegan, the following morning. In 2004, Brady began the season with a career-best win over David Chapman, who is commonly regarded as the second-greatest player of all time and who at that point was the world number one, in the final of the Ultimate Handball Showdown in Seattle. Brady comfortably defeated the Californian to win the first prize of $50,000, still the richest purse in the sport's history. He followed up by claiming second, and another $10,000 cheque, to Chapman the following week in Alaska, but it would be 12 months before Brady finally became the first Irishman to win the US Nationals, the most prestigious tournament in American with a century of history behind it. At the 2005 renewal in Houston, Texas, Brady saw off Healy 21-12, 21-5 in the semi-final before defeating Danny Bell (Canada) - who had shocked American Naty Alvarado Jr in the semi-final, on the same scoreline in the final. The following June, Brady retained his US Nationals title, defeating Alvarado 21-2, 21-18 on the Californian's home court at Los Cabaleros in LA. He also added the US Nationals Open Doubles title with Finnegan, seeing off top Americans Vince Munoz and Marcos Chavez in an 11-10 tiebreaker in the semi- final. In August, he followed up with his second world title, this time in Edmonton, Canada, again defeating Healy in straight games in the final. All the while, Brady was continuing his unbeaten run in the Irish senior championships, defeating Healy and Eoin Kennedy in a succession of finals. In 2009, Brady retained his US Nationals title in June and that October, in Portland, Oregon, he overcame a serious quad injury to come through a tough field in the World Championships, eventually beating Texan Allan Garner in an 11-7 tiebreaker in the final to claim his third world title. He followed this up with two more All Ireland senior titles, seeing off first-time finalist Charly Shanks of Armagh in 2010 and again in 2011, overcoming a career- threatening finger injury in the latter year, an injury which saw him miss the US Nationals, in which he had been unbeaten since 2005. 2012 was an annus mirabilis for the Cavanman. Back from injury, he trounced new rival Robbie McCarthy 21-6, 21-1 in the All Ireland senior final and followed up by reclaming his US Nationals title with a final win over Shanks. In October, he announced plans to retire from Irish singles play in 2013 before winning his fourth World Open Singles crown, defeating American Luis Moreno 21-19, 21-10 in a magnificent final watched by 4,000 fans in CityWest, Dublin. Brady in action during the 2012 World Championships in CityWest, Dublin. Two weeks later, he defeated Charly Shanks in the final of the Simple Green US Open in Los Angeles, his fourth time to win the event. Gaelic football career Brady was first called into the Cavan senior panel by Mattie Kerrigan in the winter of 2002. He played for Cavan for nine years, generally at wing-back but also in the half-forward line, and was regarded as one of the most consistent players in the county. He earned a call-up to the Ulster squad for the inter- provincial series and has two county U21 medals, three Cavan SFC medals (1998, 2006 and 2012) and one Senior League medal (2012) with Mullahoran Dreadnoughts. He was Man of the Match in the 2012 county final win over Kingscourt Stars. Brady's uncle was the great Phil 'The Gunner' Brady who played for Cavan for many years, winning three All-Ireland medals.

State - 39% Science in Motion Wyomissing Area Junior Senior High School does not took advantage of a state program called Science in Motion which brought college professors and sophisticated science equipment to the school to raise science awareness and to provide inquiry-based experiences for the students. The Science in Motion program was funded by a state appropriation and cost the school nothing to participate.The Pennsylvania Basic Education/Higher Education Science and Technology Partnership, Science in Motion annual report, 2012 Elizabethtown College provides the science enrichment experiences to schools in the region. =College Remediation Rate= According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 40% of the Wyomissing Area Junior Senior High School graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics, IPEDS Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, 2008 Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. Dual Enrollment The Wyomissing Area Junior Senior High School does not offer the Pennsylvania Dual Enrollment program which permits students to earn deeply discounted college credits while still enrolled in high school. The program is offered through over 400 school districts. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. Under state rules, other students that reside in the district, who attend a private school, a charter school or are homeschooled are eligible to participate in this program. In 2010, Governor Edward Rendell eliminated the grants to students, from the Commonwealth, due to a state budget crisis. =Graduation requirements= Among Pennsylvania's 500 public school districts, graduation requirements widely vary. The Wyomissing Area School Board has determined that a pupil must earn 26.5 credits to graduate, including: math - 3 credits, English - 4 credits, social studies - 4 credits, science - 3 credits, Applied computers - 0.5 credits, Physical Education - 2 credits, Health - 0.25 credits, Family and Consumer science - 0.25 credits and electives 9.5 credits. By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students were required to complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2017, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the Keystone Exams. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams replace the PSSAs for 11th grade. Students have several opportunities to pass the exam, with those who do not able to perform a project in order to graduate. For the class of 2019, a Composition exam will be added. For the class of 2020, passing a civics and government exam will be added to the graduation requirements.Pennsylvania Department of Education, State Board of Education Finalizes Adoption of Pennsylvania Common Core State Academic Standards and High School Graduation Requirements, March 14, 2013 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their IEP. AP Courses The AP¬Æ participation rate at Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School is 66 percent. Wyomissing students who enroll in AP courses must pay for and take the exam. Students may take any AP exam without taking the AP course. Taking an AP test, however, cannot be substituted for course credit towards graduation. =SAT scores= In 2012, 135 Wyomissing Area School District students took the SAT exams. The district's Verbal Average Score was 533. The Math average score was 534. The Writing average score was 526. The statewide Verbal SAT exams results were: Verbal 491, Math 501, Writing 480. In the US, 1.65 million students took the exams achieving scores: Verbal 496, Math 514, Writing 488.

In December 2009, the district administration reported that 291 pupils or 15.6% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 44.7% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2006, the district administration reported that 267 pupils or 13.9% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 57.7% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010‚Äì11 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, Wyomissing Area School District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the district's Special Education Department. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per-pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Wyomissing Area School District received a $742,988 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013‚Äì14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010‚Äì11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district must apply for this added funding. Gifted education Wyomissing Area School District Administration reported that 73 or 3.93% of its students were gifted in 2009. In 2014 that percentage grew, having the acceptable IQ be 130 or more. The average IQ of a gifted Wyomissing student was 133. Among Berks County school districts Oley Valley School District reported the highest gifted population percentage - 7.07%, while Schuylkill Valley School District reported the lowest gifted rate 1.55% of student population. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Wellness policy Wyomissing Area School Board established a district wellness policy in May 2006. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Wyomissing Area School District offers a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of the lunch. Wyomissing Area School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. Highmark Healthy High 5 grant In 2011, Wyomissing Area School District received funding through a Highmark Healthy High 5 grant. Wyomissing Area Junior Senior High School received $7,440 which was used to purchase equipment to enhance the cardio and strength training curriculum.Highmark Foundation, 2011 School Challenge Grants, 2011 Beginning in 2006, Highmark Foundation engaged in a 5-year, $100 million program to promote lifelong healthy behaviors in children and adolescents through local nonprofits and schools. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2011, the average teacher salary in Wyomissing Area School District was $58,955 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers received was $19,044 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $77,999. The district employed 169 teachers with an average salary of $59,500 and a top salary of $171,000. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers‚Äô total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In February 2013, the Wyomissing Area School Board and Wyomissing Area School Teachers Union agreed to a retroactive three-year contract which ends in 2013‚Äì14. Both parties agree to accept a Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board fact-finder's report and recommendations. In 2009, Wyomissing Area School District reported employing 176 teachers and administrators with a median salary of $56,381 and a top salary of $127,296 to an assistant superintendent. The teacher's work day is 7 hours 30 minutes with 180 student days in the contract year. In addition to salary, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance (district pays 100% of the costs), dental insurance, vision insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, professional development reimbursement, 2 paid personal days which accumulate, 10 paid sick days which infinitely accumulate, 3 paid bereavement days and other benefits. Departing employees receive a severance payment of $150 per year to $300 per year depending on longevity. In 2012, Reading Hospital and the Wyomissing Area School District were involved in a contentious tax battle. The resolution was the hospital providing $408,500 worth of health services to the district for four years in lieu of paying property taxes. Per-pupil spending Wyomissing Area School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $1,404.50 per pupil. The district ranked 10th in the state for administration spending. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil.Fenton, Jacob., Pennsylvania School District Data: Will School Consolidation Save Money?, The Morning Call, February 2009 The Pennsylvania School Boards Association collects and maintains statistics on salaries of public school district employees in Pennsylvania. According to the association's report, the average salary for a superintendent, for the 2007‚Äì08 school year, was $122,165. Superintendents and administrators receive a benefit package commensurate with that offered to the district's teachers' union. According to PSBA, the median Superintendent salary rose to over $130,000 in 2011. Wyomissing hired David P Krem as superintendent on July 1, 2010. He had served as the superintendent of the Pottstown School District. Krem's starting $164,000 salary made him the highest-paid superintendent in Berks County. Krem retired in June 2012 with a salary of $174,000. The board appointed then assistant superintendent of elementary and secondary education, Julia R.

In 2010, the district's per-pupil spending had increased to $15,400.53. In 2011, Pennsylvania's per-pupil spending was $13,467, ranking 6th in the United States.US Census Bureau, States Ranked According to Per Pupil Public Elementary-Secondary School System Finance Amounts: Fiscal Year 2011, May 2013 In 2007, the Pennsylvania per-pupil total expenditures was reported as $12,759. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that Pennsylvania spent $8,191 per pupil in school year 2000‚Äì01. In 2007, the Pennsylvania per-pupil total expenditures was reported as $12,759. Among the fifty states, Pennsylvania's total per-pupil revenue (including all sources) ranked 11th at $15,023 per student, in 2008‚Äì09.

Reserves In 2008, Wyomissing Area School District reported a balance of $2,602,654.00, in its unreserved- undesignated fund. The unreserved-designated fund balance was reported as zero. In 2011, Wyomissing Area School District Administration reported an increase to $5,504,615 in the reserve fund balance. Pennsylvania public school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 By 2013, reserves held by Pennsylvania public school districts, as a whole, had increased to over $3.8 billion. Audit In June 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the Wyomissing Area School District. Multiple significant findings were reported to the School Board and the district's administration. Tuition Students who live in the Wyomissing Area School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Wyomissing Area School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the Wyomissing Area School District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are elementary school - $9,742.64, high school - $11,707.99. In 2007, based on a state mandate the Wyomissing Area School Board conducted a voter referendum asking about raising the local earned income tax to 1.5% with a lowering of local property taxes to keep the district's revenue the same. The referendum was rejected 1,311 No, 630 Yes. Among the public school districts in Berks County, the tax shift was approved in Reading School District and rejected in all other local districts. Wyomissing Area School District is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax 0.5%, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. Interest earnings on accounts also provide nontax income to the district. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth. The average Pennsylvania public school teacher pension in 2011 exceeds $60,000 a year plus they receive federal Social Security benefits: both are free of Pennsylvania state income tax and local income tax which funds local public schools. State basic education funding For the 2013‚Äì14 school year, Wyomissing Area School District received a 6.3% increase or $1,260,225 in Pennsylvania Basic Education Funding.

The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some public school districts at a far greater rate than others.

This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, All Day Kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010‚Äì11, the district applied for and received $81,031 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district uses the funding to provide Full Day kindergarten.

Rendell. =Other grants= Wyomissing Area School District did not participate in: Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education annual grants, Education Assistance Grants, 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, nor the federal 21st Century Learning grants. Federal Stimulus grant Wyomissing Area School District received an extra $497,200 in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010‚Äì2011 school years.

Real estate taxes Property tax rates in 2013‚Äì14 were set by the Wyomissing Area School Board at 29.0529 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2012‚Äì13 - 28.5673 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2012‚Äì13, 2012 *2011‚Äì12 - 28.2845 mills *2010‚Äì11 - 27.8940 mills *2009‚Äì10 - 27.1080 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports, 2010 *2008‚Äì09 - 26.4125 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports 2008‚Äì09 Real Estate Mills, 2009 *2007‚Äì08 - 25.1700 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006‚Äì07 - 23.8400 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005‚Äì06 - 22.3500 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Berks County residents amounts to about 4.66% of their yearly income.

According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. =Act 1 Adjusted Index= The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above their annual Act 1 Index unless they either: allow Districts voters to approve the increase through a vote by referendum or they receive an exception from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The base index for the school year is published by the PDE in the fall of each year. Each individual school district's Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as local property values and the personal income of district residents. Originally, Act 1 of 2006 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation eliminating six of the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The legislature also froze the payroll amount public school districts use to calculate the pension-plan exception at the 2012 payroll levels. Further increases in payroll cannot be used to raise the district's exception for pension payments. A specific timeline for Act I Index decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.

Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. The amount of property tax relief each Pennsylvania public school district receives is announced by the Pennsylvania Department of Education in May of each year. The amount of tax relief is dependent on the total tax revenue collected on the casino slots in the previous year. Thirty five percent of the slots tax revenues are used for property tax relief. In Berks County, the highest tax relief went to Reading School District which was set at $371.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Tax Relief per Homestead, May 1, 2009 The highest property tax relief provided, among Pennsylvania school districts, went to the homesteads of Chester Upland School District in Delaware County which received $632 per approved homestead in 2010.

There were also 18 incidents involving the local police. These included an aggravated assault on student, 15 cases of open lewdness, 7 thefts and two incidents of sexual harassment. Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center which publishes the reports online. The Wyomissing Area School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online.Wyomissing Area School Board, Bullying/ Cyberbullying Policy 249, October 27, 2008 All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti- bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Enrollment According to Pennsylvania Department of Education enrollment reports, there were 1,887 students enrolled in K-12 in 2007‚Äì08 school year at Wyomissing Area School District. There were 158 students in the Class of 2009. The district's class of 2010 had 140 students. The Class of 2013 has134 pupils. Enrollment is projected to decline to 1,6885 students by 2020.< In 2008, the district administrative costs were $1,404.50 per pupil. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil.Fenton, Jacob., Pennsylvania School District Data: Will School Consolidation Save Money?, The Morning Call, February 2009 A study of Pennsylvania public school spending, conducted by Standard and Poor's, examined the consolidation of small public school districts. The study found that school districts with less than 3000 pupils overspend on administrative services and that consolidation of the administration with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial administrative cost savings which varied by district. According to a 2009 school district administration consolidation proposal by Governor Edward Rendell, the excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improve lagging academic achievement, to enrich the academic programs or to reduce property taxes. Consolidation of two central administrations into one would not require the closing of any schools. The Governor's proposal called for the savings to be redirected to improving lagging reading and science achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing residents' property taxes. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants released a report finding that the state would save hundreds of millions of tax dollars, by cutting the number of school administrations in half through consolidation, with no impact on programs offered to students. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity.2009‚Äì10 Executive Budget Fast Facts. Pennsylvania Office of the Governor In a survey of superintendents of small districts, 42% of the respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools. Extracurriculars Wyomissing Area School District offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, costly sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletics Association (PIAA).

The eight scenes of \\"The World Is Moving Forward\\"The musical is commercially available today on both CD and video, as well as online with English subtitles. The film is also known as The East Is Red: A Song and Dance Epic. Pre-life of the inspiration In 1960, the Senior General of the People‚Äôs Liberation Army General Staff Department (GSD) Luo Peiqing visited North Korea, along with air force commander Liu Yalou. During their visit to DPRK, the Korean side performed a large-scaled song and dance called Three Thousand Miles of Mountains and Rivers, which the content of the performance was largely adapted from songs and dances during the war period. On their way back to China, Shenyang military area command also held a party and performed four revolutionary songs. After coming back to China, an idea of making a revolution-related artistic work by using the popular revolutionary songs among the public emerged in Liu Yalou‚Äôs mind. Which he thought it could encourage the public during the difficult three-year period. By the end of 1960,the Air Political and Cultural Troupe sent songwriters including Zhang Shixie, Zhu Jianyuan, Yao Xuecheng, Chen Jie, etc. to collect and integrate the revolutionary songs. After the intense creation, the script named The Glorious History was made and given to Liu Yaluo. Later, suggested by Niu Chang, they renamed it as ‚ÄúRevolutionary History Songs Singing‚Äù and started to show it to the audiences. After Zhou Enlai saw Revolutionary History Songs Singing and Growing Under the Banner of Mao in 1964, he made proposals to other Chinese Communist Party leaders about making a song-and-dance epic for the 15th anniversary of National Day. The proposal was approved, and the stage song-and-dance epic was originally called Under the Banner, but the party leaders thought the name was too long and they renamed it to The East Is Red. There were at least 3,000 people involved with the production, including a chorus of a thousand singers. The stage version of The East Is Red premiered on October 1, 1964, and audiences were amazed. Mao himself also attended the performance, but he took all of the credit of creating the play in the press, despite it being created by Zhou.http://dangshi.people.com.cn/n/2015/1003/c85037-27658812.html Plot summary The musical depicts the history of the Communist Party of China under Mao Zedong from its founding in July 1921 to the establishment of \\"New China\\" in 1949. Detailed in the musical are several key events in CPC history such as the Northern Expedition (taken up by the Kuomintang (KMT) National Revolutionary Army with Chinese Communist and Soviet support), the KMT-led Shanghai massacre of 1927, the Nanchang Uprising and formation of the People's Liberation Army, the Long March, guerrilla warfare of the PLA during the Second United Front (during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression), the subsequent overthrow of the National Government of the Republic of China on Mainland China by the PLA in the decisive phase of the Chinese Civil War, and the founding of the People's Republic on October 1, 1949. Singers in the film include Wang Kun, Tseten Dolma, Hu Song Hua and Guo Lanying. Historical background It was during the Great Chinese Famine when Liu Yalou decided to make this work. During 1959 to 1961, at least 15 million of the Chinese population died due to the starvation contributed by policies of the Great Leap Forward and People‚Äôs commune, as well as natural disasters. The East is Red was previously a peasant love song, and soon became a call to arms in the Anti-Japanese War. This song was also a paean extolling Mao. It was written in the early 1930s as a folk song that was popular among the farmers of Shanxi, a village near the communist base of Yan'an. It originally went: \\"Sesame oil, cabbage hearts, Wanna eat string beans, break off the tips, Get really lovesick if I don't see you for 3 days Hu-er-hai-yo, Oh dear, Third Brother mine.\\" In 1938, the song was reworded in order to provoke people in the fight against the Japanese invaders. \\"Riding a white horse, carrying a rifle, Third brother is with the Eighth Route Army. Wanna go home to see my girl, Hu-er-hai-yo, But fighting the Japs I don't have the time.\\" After the rise of Mao as the leader of the Communist Party in the early 1940s, the song was reworked again by a teacher and became a key feature of Yan'an life. \\"The East is red, the sun has risen. Mao Zedong has appeared in China. He is devoted to the peoples welfare, Hu-er-hai-yo, He is the people's great savior.\\" [See \\"Songs of the Cultural Revolution,\\" by He Shu, China News Digest, Vol. 235, Oct. 18, 2000.] From stage performance to film Not long after its premiere, Zhou had the idea of turning the stage performance into a film adaptation. During his meeting with Jiang Qing and the vice minister of culture, Jiang disagreed with the film because the adaptation was made on political grounds. Despite this, he proceeded and three movie companies came together to film it. Wang Ping, co-director Li Enjie, and August First Film Studio. Principal cinematography finished on September 18, 1965, and at this moment he had not slept for 24 hours. The movie was released on National Day of 1965. The movie version of The East is Red is a film adaptation of the stage performance, which they were not entirely similar. The six story‚Äôs main sections which depicted the history of the Communist Party remained while some of the scenes were cut. The film version was launched on October 2, 1965.https://supchina.com/2019/05/24/zhou-enlais-historical-musical-the-east- is-red/http://history.people.com.cn/GB/199250/241996/17609674.html  Soundtrack  * Orchestra, ensemble and choirs - Overture: \\"The East is Red\\" (with dance) * Orchestra, ensemble and choirs - \\"Northern October Winds\\" * Orchestra, ensemble and choirs - \\"Over The Snowy Meadows\\" * Orchestra, ensemble and choirs - \\"Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, Unite!\\" * Orchestra, ensemble, choirs and lady duettists - \\"(For the Red Army) Wooden Hunan Shoes\\" * Orchestra, ensemble, and male choir - \\"Three Rules and Eight Notices\\" (Adaptation of the military anthem of China) * Orchestra, ensemble and choirs - \\"Looking at the North Star\\" * Orchestra, ensemble and choirs - \\"Crossing the Dadu River\\" (with dance) * Orchestra, ensemble and lady soloist - \\"Song of the Yi People\\" * Orchestra, ensemble and male choir - \\"The Armies Have Reunited (Long Live the Red Army)\\" * Orchestra, ensemble, choirs and male soloist - \\"The Long March\\" * Orchestra, ensemble and soloists - \\"Along the Sungari River\\" (Ballad of the Northeasters) * Orchestra and ensemble- \\"March of the Volunteers\\" (1st performance) * Orchestra, ensemble and choir - \\"Song of the Military and Political University of Resistance Against Japan\\" * Orchestra, ensemble and choir - \\"Song of Guerrillas\\" * Orchestra, ensemble, ladies choir and soloist - \\"Nanniwan\\" * Orchestra, ensemble and choirs - \\"Defend the Yellow River\\" from the Yellow River Cantata * Orchestra, ensemble and choirs - \\"Unity is Strength\\" * Orchestra, ensemble and male choir - Military Anthem of the People's Liberation Army * Orchestra, ensemble, choirs and duettists- \\"The People's Liberation Army Captures Nanking City\\" (One of Chairman Mao's poems) * Orchestra and ensemble - \\"March of the Volunteers\\" (2nd performance) (National Anthem of the People's Republic of China, played at the beginning of Act 6, in the Tiananmen Square scene) * Orchestra, ensemble and choirs - \\"Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China\\" * Orchestra, ensemble, and male soloist - Paean * Orchestra, ensemble, ladies choir and soloists - \\"Song of Liberated Tibetan Serfs\\" * Orchestra, ensemble and choirs - Finale: \\"Ode to the Motherland\\" * Orchestra, ensemble and choirs - \\"The Internationale\\" (Words by Eug√®ne Pottier, music by Pierre Degeyter, Chinese translation by Qu Qiubai) Only the first verse is sung at the finale scene. In the film, these songs are accompanied and punctuated by exaggerated acing and dancing, resembling that of the displays of silent era films. Such acting incorporates acts of violence such as the whipping of laborers by suit wearing, blonde haired, Western capitalists and their Chinese friends. It is interesting that many scenes involve dancing girls pointing AK-47's. The songs and dances incorporated within the film convey raw revolutionary passion behind each song within the soundtrack. Another important aspect of the sound in The East is Red is the voice over narration. Between each scene the narration describes the Chinese People's difficulties during each scene's time period, which helps uneducated spectators understand the film more easily. Composition analysis The East is Red, performed by little egret folk dance troupe, Department of Chinese folk dance, Beijing Dance Academy, is a representative work of group dance. In the beginning, the actors connect points and points, points and lines, and points and surfaces, which increases the level sense of dance in space. From 42 seconds part of the dance began to transform into a triangle, the neat dance and background music perfectly combined to create a tense atmosphere. The part of 1:04 duet is to use the relationship between \\"point\\" and \\"face\\", to highlight the main body by arranging the position of the main body reasonably. From the perspective of plane space, the composition is a variety of figures formed by dancers. In order to reveal the theme and express abstract art, different \\"forms\\" have different functions. In 2 minutes and 40 seconds, different points (high, low, front, and back) are designed to form a line. The connection between the weak area and the strong area creates a new image that is emphasized. It presents a magnificent historical scene in the plane space so that the audience can enjoy different characters, which is unforgettable.https://wenku.baidu.com/view/be4150a9a5e9856a57126009.html Image of ethnic minorities The East is red is the first time for ethnic minorities and Han people to dance together on the same platform. It has formed a vivid, emotional and specific national image in the hearts of the people of all ethnic groups, and achieved the integration of marginal culture and central culture. In this musical and dance epic, we can see the emotional expression of many ethnic minorities and Han people, such as the meeting between Caidan Zhuoma, one of the leaders of ethnic minorities, and Zhou Enlai. In the whole music and dance epic, the image of ethnic minorities is: singing and dancing, full of joy and optimism. For more than 40 years since then, the image expression of ethnic minorities has basically been defined in this expression, without much change. The expression of the image of China's ethnic minorities is closely linked with the expression of the image of the country. Although the number of ethnic minorities is small, they are an important part of the Chinese nation. The unity and harmony of all ethnic groups become a basic point of the image of the country. https://wenku.baidu.com/view/e8986521777f5acfa1c7aa00b52acfc789eb9faf.html Integration of national culture \\"Oriental red\\" has applied more than 30 songs in just over two hours, and many songs have been adapted for folk songs, which reflects the unity of all ethnic groups, but it is not a simple retro. For example, \\"deep feelings\\" is adapted from the folk tune of the Yi nationality, the song of the Yueqin. After being adapted into \\"deep love\\", there are not only the singing styles of folk songs but also the lyrics and revolutionary history. The integration of ethnic minority culture, Han culture, and revolutionary red culture awaken people's expectation and yearning for a better life enriches people's spiritual life and makes up for the lack of material life. For example, the lyrics of \\"millions of serfs stand up\\" can reflect the ethnic minority's abhorrence of the backward and miserable days and yearning for a new life. In the prelude \\"sunflower to the sun\\" of \\"Oriental red\\", the sunflower is the people of all ethnic groups, and the sun is Mao Zedong. This overall tone has specific political implications. Almost all the lyrics and recitation words have the keywords of red and black, new and old, light and dark, forming a sharp contrast. Brief explanation of the six stages The first \\"dawn of the East\\" starts with the long dance segment of \\"years of suffering\\". Through realism, it shows all kinds of sufferings experienced by the Chinese people since modern times. The actors have distinct personalities. They not only have the characters with distinctive personalities such as dockers, white-haired old people, and foreign invaders but also borrow the folk \\"river and river\\" on the soundtrack The tunes of the Chinese people are used to make up the atmosphere and fully express the miserable life of the Chinese people. The second scene \\"a single fire starts a prairie fire\\" includes four parts. The first part is the performance of \\"the righteous song\\". Through the tragic and vigorous tone of the Western orchestral music and the leading vocals of the tenor, it has a stronger shock against the background of the chorus. It has become a prominent righteous song in the history of music. The music and dance techniques adopted have also become a paradigm. \\"Autumn Harvest Uprising\\" is the main part of the show. By increasing the number of torches on the stage, it symbolizes the continuous development of the revolutionary team. ‚ÄúJinggangshan meeting‚Äù is a performance field composed of three songs, in which the duet of female voice \\"two pairs of straw sandals for the Red Army\\" adopts the technique of double voice polyphony to make the front section have the characteristics of Jiangxi folk songs, and the second half reflects the good atmosphere of military and civilian unity in the base area. \\"Fighting against the local tyrants and dividing the land\\" describes the people's dissatisfaction and complaints against their enemies. The third performance of \\"thousands of rivers and mountains\\" shows that the Chinese Red Army of workers and peasants has passed the difficult journey of the long march through singing and dancing. The songs used in the song and dance programs, such as \\"Long March\\", \\"over snow mountain and grass\\", make the audience more impressed with the classic historical stories. The singing was carried out in a way that the tenor and the chorus matched each other, highlighting Chairman Mao's wisdom and the courage of the Red Army. The fourth \\"the war of resistance against Japan\\" shows the heroic feat of the Chinese people's tenacious resistance to foreign aggression since the September 18th Incident, which consists of five parts. ‚Äúon the Song Hua River‚Äù takes the fall of the northeast as the background of the whole scene, which indicates the opening of the Anti-Japanese War; guerrilla song uses rhythmic drums to run through the whole song, giving people a sense of tension. \\"Mass production\\" is a performance, which uses songs \\"Nanniwan\\", \\"coming in February\\" and \\"ten songs in the border area\\" created during the Yan'an mass production movement to show the gains brought by mass production to the army and the people. The fifth \\"burying the Jiang family dynasty\\" is composed of four sections. It mainly talks about that after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chiang Kai Shek launched a civil war with the support of American imperialism, which brought heavy disaster to the Chinese people. The Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang fought fiercely. Among them, the songs \\"unity is power\\" and \\"not afraid to go to jail\\" show that the Communist Party of China has vowed to defend the people at the bottom of China. \\"March dance\\" and \\"a million heroes crossing the river\\" express the CPC's quick victory over the Kuomintang through dance. ‚ÄúThe occupation of Nanjing by the Chinese people's Liberation Army‚Äù put a successful end to the fifth performance. The sixth \\"the Chinese people stand up\\" is the last play and the sublimation of the whole scene. Through the singing of \\"ode\\" and \\"Chairman Mao, I wish you a long life\\" by Hu Songhua, a minority singer, and Caidan Zhuoma, who show the enthusiasm and love of the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life for the great leader. After that, the \\"motherland in progress\\" and \\"the world in progress\\" fully affirmed the achievements of victory. The Chinese people, together with the oppressed people of the world, resisted the fascist colonial rule and the imperialist aggression and colonial activities. https://www.docin.com/p-756276520.html Related artworks inspired by the film Photographer Zhao Shela made a project named The East was Red, which she got her inspiration from the film ‚ÄúThe East is Red‚Äù and examined the power and prevalence of political messaging in photography from that time.

Koersvast: vijf eeuwen navigatie op zee, Zaltbommel, The Netherlands. ; pp. 46-59 (Dutch)) was a Dutch cartographer and explorer. He served for both the Noordsche Compagnie and the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (Dutch East India Company). Career Carolus apparently was a native of Enkhuizen. After he lost a leg at the Siege of Ostend (1601‚Äì04) he turned to the art of navigation and became a pilot (Stierman). In 1614 he was pilot of the Enkhuizen ship den Orangienboom (‚ÄúOrange Tree‚Äù), under Jacob de Gouwenaer, one of the two ships sent by the whaling company Noordsche Compagnie on a voyage of discovery. Carolus claimed to have reached 83¬∞ N, but this would have been impossible given the ice conditions described by Robert Fotherby, who was also on a voyage of discovery in the ship Thomasine, sent by the rival Muscovy Company of England. According to Fotherby‚Äîwho saw the Dutch ships riding off Amsterdam Island on July 6/16, \\"ready for the first opportunity to discover\\", and on August 9/19 \\"two ships of the Hollanders, that were appointed for northern discovery, were seene thwart of Faire Haven, sayling to the southwards\\"‚Äî the ice was packed along the northern coast of Spitsbergen. Even in shallops the English were only able to go as far north as Castlins Point (modern Gr√•huken, at 79¬∞ 48‚ÄôN). On the same voyage Carolus came upon the island of Jan Mayen, which may have been discovered earlier the same year by the Dutchman Fopp Gerritsz., sailing in a whaleship sent by the Englishman John Clarke, of Dunkirk.Hart, S. De eerste Nederlandse tochten ter walvisvaart (1957), p. 50. Hart says it occurred in 1613. Carolus named it after himself: Mr. Joris eylandt. He also named a bay Gowenaers bay (which name was moved to Gouwenaerb√•en) after the master of his ship, and a cape Jan Meys hoeck. This latter name, in honor of Jan Jacobsz. May, master of the other ship sent on discovery, de goude Cath (‚ÄúThe Golden Cat‚Äù) of Amsterdam, was later (1620) applied to the island as a whole, giving it the name it retains to this day. Following his 1614 expedition to Spitsbergen Carolus charted a map of the islands. The map labels various features, including Generaels hoeck (South Cape), Bell sound (Bellsund), Greene harbergh (Gr√∏nfjorden), Mari mag. bay (Magdalenefjorden), Hollandsche bay or Feer-haven (Fairhaven), and de Reus (\\"The Giant\\", Cloven Cliff), among other things. The map also shows what may be Edge Island‚Äôs south coast. Carolus showed the coastline split into two parts: Onbekende Cust (‚ÄúUnknown Coast‚Äù) in the west, and Morfyn (a corruption of Matsyn, part of Novaya Zemlya) in the east. Islands are shown offshore of Morfyn. Martin Conway argued in 1901 that Carolus‚Äô chart indicated that he had discovered Edge Island; but, as Wielder points out, Conway was ignorant of a map (engraved in 1612) by the Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius, which illustrated a coastline to the east of Spitsbergen. The coastline, indented, with islands offshore, was labelled Gerrits Eylant. Wielder believed this to the first record of Edge Island‚Äôs south coast, when in fact this coastline as well was only copied from an earlier chart which merely showed a vague mass that was supposed to represent Spitsbergen. Edward Heawood, writing in response to Conway‚Äôs claim of Carolus being the first discoverer of Edge Island, wrote a \\"Correspondence\\" refuting his claim. Carolus, who never made any claim of having discovered the said island (which is counter to his usual boastfull claims of discovery), shows Morfyn (or Marfyn, which Conway said represented Edge Island) some 18¬∞ too far east (relative to the mainland), while Onbekende Cust, which is supposed to represent Kvalpynten (which Heawood questioned as to why Carolus should refer to a land he allegedly discovered as ‚Äúunknown‚Äù?), extends the longitude of the island to 30¬∞, instead of its actual 4¬∞ of longitude. Heawood asserts that Carolus may have only copied both coastlines from earlier maps‚Äîin particular, Onbekende Cust may correspond to the land (without name) placed between Spitsbergen and Matsyn on a Dutch map of 1611. The following year, 1615, Carolus was sent by the Noordsche Compagnie on a voyage to the Davis Strait region. Passing through the strait he allegedly reached the impossible latitude of 80¬∞ N. The results of this voyage were presented in a (now lost) chart to the States General, and mentioned in a resolution of November 26, 1615. Carolus later (see below) described Baffin Bay in a book he published, saying it extended to 79¬∞ N and was enclosed by land. In 1617, Carolus was again sent on a voyage of discovery by the Delft, Hoorn, and Enkhuizen chambers of the Noordsche Compagnie. He claimed to have discovered two islands: New Holland, between 60¬∞ and 63¬∞ N, and Opdams island, at 66¬∞ N and twenty Dutch miles east of Iceland. Both islands were depicted on a map Carolus supplied to the Noordsche Compagnie, which applied to the States General for a monopoly on whaling rights at the islands (which was granted on October 28, 1617). \\"When at length his years and growing feebleness prevented him from voyaging, he settled down at Amsterdam as teacher of navigation, and published a book of charts and sailing directions, now very rare, entitled Het nieuw vermeerde Licht, ghenaemt de Sleutel van‚Äôt Tresoor, Spiegel, Gesicht, ende vierighe Colon des Grooten Zeevaerts.

The one shown above is a post-2007 issued passport. A passport is commonly used as an identity document and as proof of citizenship. Citizenship of the United States is a status that entails specific rights, duties and benefits in the United States. It serves as a foundation of fundamental rights derived from and protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States, such as freedom of expression, due process, the rights to vote, to live and work in the United States, and to receive federal assistance. The implementation of citizenship requires attitudes including allegiance to the republic, participation, and an impulse to promote communities. Certain rights are so fundamental that they are guaranteed to all persons, not just citizens. Not all citizens have the right to vote in federal elections, for example, those living in Puerto Rico. There are two primary sources of citizenship: birthright citizenship, in which a person is presumed to be a citizen if he or she was born within the territorial limits of the United States, or‚Äîproviding certain other requirements are met‚Äîborn abroad to a United States citizen parent, (\\"Nationals and citizens of United States at birth\\"); Note: A person is presumed to be a full citizen in the sense of having a duty to pay some types of taxes and serve on juries, upon reaching the age of majority. At present the age of majority is 18 years. and naturalization, a process in which an eligible legal immigrant applies for citizenship and is accepted. (\\"The term 'naturalization' means the conferring of nationality of a state upon a person after birth, by any means whatsoever\\".) (emphasis added). These two pathways to citizenship are specified in the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution which reads: National citizenship signifies membership in the country as a whole; state citizenship, in contrast, signifies a relation between a person and a particular state and has application generally limited to domestic matters. State citizenship may affect (1) tax decisions, (2) eligibility for some state-provided benefits such as higher education, and (3) eligibility for state political posts such as United States senator. In Article One of the Constitution, the power to establish a \\"uniform rule of naturalization\\" is granted explicitly to Congress. United States law permits multiple citizenship. Citizens of other countries who are naturalized as United States citizens may retain their previous citizenship, although they must renounce allegiance to the other country. A United States citizen retains United States citizenship when becoming the citizen of another country, should that country's laws allow it. United States citizenship can be renounced by Americans who also hold another citizenship via a formal procedure at a United States embassy.  Rights, duties, and benefits   Rights  all-volunteer force since the end of the Vietnam War, but male United States citizens and non-citizens are still required to register for the military draft within 30 days of their 18th birthday. * Freedom to reside and work. United States citizens have the right to reside and work in the United States. Certain non-citizens, such as lawful permanent residents, have similar rights; however, non-citizens, unlike citizens, may have the right taken away. For example, they may be deported if convicted of a serious crime.United States Citizenship and Immigration Services: Citizenship Through Naturalization: A Guide to Naturalization, page 28 of 58 in PDF, page 25 in hard copy * Freedom to enter and leave the United States. United States citizens have the right to enter and leave the United States freely. Certain non-citizens, such as permanent residents, have similar rights. Unlike permanent residents, United States citizens do not have an obligation to maintain residence in the United States ‚Äì they can leave for any length of time and return freely at any time. * Voting for federal office in all fifty states and the District of Columbia is restricted to citizens only. States are not required to extend the franchise to all citizens: for example, several states bar citizen felons from voting, even after they have completed any custodial sentence. The United States Constitution bars states from restricting citizens from voting on grounds of race, color, previous condition of servitude, sex, failure to pay any tax, or age (for citizens who are at least eighteen years old). Historically, many states and local jurisdictions have allowed non-citizens to vote; however, today this is limited to local elections in very few places. Citizens are not compelled to vote. * Freedom to stand for public office. The United States Constitution requires that all members of the United States House of Representatives have been citizens for seven years, and that all senators have been citizens for nine years, before taking office. Most states have similar requirements: for example California requires that legislators have been citizens for three years, and the Governor has been a citizen for five years, upon taking office. The United States Constitution requires that one be \\"a natural born Citizen\\" and a United States resident for fourteen years in order to be president of the United States or vice president of the United States. The Constitution also stipulates that otherwise eligible citizens must meet certain age requirements for these offices. * Right to apply for federal employment. Many federal government jobs require applicants to have United States citizenship. United States citizens can apply for federal employment within a government agency or department.  Duties  serve on a jury. Citizens are required to file United States taxes even if they do not live in the United States. * Jury duty is only imposed upon citizens. Jury duty may be considered the \\"sole differential obligation\\" between non-citizens and citizens; the federal and state courts \\"uniformly exclude non-citizens from jury pools today, and with the exception of a few states in the past, this has always been the case\\". * Military participation is not currently required in the United States, but a policy of conscription of men has been in place at various times (both in war and in peace) in American history, most recently during the Vietnam War. Currently, the United States Armed Forces are a professional all-volunteer force, although both male United States citizens and male non-citizen permanent residents are required to register with the Selective Service System and may be called up in the event of a future draft. Johns Hopkins University political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg writes, \\"The professional military has limited the need for citizen soldiers\\". * Taxes. In the United States today, everyone except those whose income is derived from tax-exempt revenue (Subchapter N, Section 861 of the U.S. Tax Code) is required to file a federal income tax return. American citizens are subject to federal income tax on worldwide income regardless of their country of residence. * Census. A response to the decennial census is mandated by Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution and by Title 13 of the United States Code of all residents. A response to the American Community Survey is also mandated by Title 13, U.S. Code, Sections 141, 193, and 221, as changed by Title 18.  Benefits  * Consular protection outside the United States. While traveling abroad, if a person is arrested or detained by foreign authorities, the person can request to speak to somebody from the United States Embassy or Consulate. Consular officials can provide resources for Americans incarcerated abroad, such as a list of local attorneys who speak English. The United States government may even intervene on the person's behalf. Non-citizen United States nationals also have this benefit. * Increased ability to sponsor relatives living abroad. Several types of immigrant visas require that the person requesting the visa be directly related to a United States citizen. Having United States citizenship facilitates the granting of IR and F visas to family members. * Ability to invest in United States real property without triggering FIRPTA. Perhaps the only quantifiable economic benefit of United States citizenship, citizens are not subject to additional withholding tax on income and capital gains derived from United States real estate under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (FIRPTA). * Transmission of United States citizenship to children born abroad. Generally, children born to two United States citizen parents abroad are automatically United States citizens at birth. When the parents are one United States citizen and one non-United States citizen, certain conditions about the United States citizen's parent's length of time spent in the United States need to be met. and (d). See United States nationality law for more details. Non-citizen United States nationals also have a similar benefit (transmission of non-citizen United States nationality to children born abroad). * Protection from deportation. Naturalized United States citizens are no longer considered aliens and cannot be placed into deportation proceedings. * Other benefits. The USCIS sometimes honors the achievements of naturalized United States citizens. The Outstanding American by Choice Award was created by the USCIS to recognize the outstanding achievements of naturalized United States citizens, and past recipients include author Elie Wiesel who won the Nobel Peace Prize; Indra K. Nooyi who was CEO of PepsiCo; John Shalikashvili who was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and others. Further, citizenship status can affect which country an athlete can compete as a member of in competitions such as the Olympics.  Civic participation  Civic participation is not required in the United States. There is no requirement to attend town meetings, belong to a political party, or vote in elections. However, a benefit of naturalization is the ability to \\"participate fully in the civic life of the country\\". Moreover, to be a citizen means to be vitally important to politics and not ignored. There is disagreement about whether popular lack of involvement in politics is helpful or harmful. Vanderbilt professor Dana D. Nelson suggests that most Americans merely vote for president every four years, and sees this pattern as undemocratic. In her book Bad for Democracy, Nelson argues that declining citizen participation in politics is unhealthy for long term prospects for democracy. However, writers such as Robert D. Kaplan in The Atlantic see benefits to non-involvement; he wrote \\"the very indifference of most people allows for a calm and healthy political climate\\". Kaplan elaborated: \\"Apathy, after all, often means that the political situation is healthy enough to be ignored. The last thing America needs is more voters‚Äîparticularly badly educated and alienated ones ‚Äî with a passion for politics\\". He argued that civic participation, in itself, is not always a sufficient condition to bring good outcomes, and pointed to authoritarian societies such as Singapore which prospered because it had \\"relative safety from corruption, from breach of contract, from property expropriation, and from bureaucratic inefficiency\\".  Dual citizenship  Dual citizenship means persons can travel with two passports. Both the United States and Nicaragua permit dual citizenship. A person who is considered a citizen by more than one nation has dual citizenship. It is possible for a United States citizen to have dual citizenship; this can be achieved in various ways, such as by birth in the United States to a parent who is a citizen of a foreign country (or in certain circumstances the foreign nationality may be transmitted even by a grandparent) by birth in another country to a parent(s) who is/are a United States citizen/s, or by having parents who are citizens of different countries. Anyone who becomes a naturalized United States citizen is required to renounce any prior \\"allegiance\\" to other countries during the naturalization ceremony; however, this renunciation of allegiance renunciation of citizenship to those countries.U.S. State Department \\"US State Department Services Dual Nationality\\" . The United States Department of State confirms on their website that a United States citizen can hold dual nationality: \\"A United States citizen may naturalize in a foreign state without any risk to his or her United States citizenship\\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal- considerations/Advice-about-Possible-Loss-of-US-Nationality-Dual- Nationality/Dual-Nationality.html The earliest recorded instances of dual citizenship began before the French Revolution when the British captured American ships and forced them back to Europe. The British Crown considered subjects from the United States as British by birth and forced them to fight in the Napoleonic wars. Under certain circumstances there are relevant distinctions between dual citizens who hold a \\"substantial contact\\" with a country, for example by holding a passport or by residing in the country for a certain period of time, and those who do not. For example, under the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax (HEART) Act of 2008, United States citizens in general are subject to an expatriation tax if they give up United States citizenship, but there are exceptions (specifically ) for those who are either under age 18¬Ω upon giving up United States citizenship and have lived in the United States for less than ten years in their lives, or who are dual citizens by birth residing in their other country of citizenship at the time of giving up United States citizenship and have lived in the United States for less than ten out of the past fifteen years. Similarly, the United States considers holders of a foreign passport to have a substantial contact with the country that issued the passport, which may preclude security clearance. United States citizens are required by federal law to identify themselves with a United States passport, not with any other foreign passport, when entering or leaving the United States.US State Department Services Dual Nationality The Supreme Court case of Afroyim v. Rusk, declared that a United States citizen did not lose his citizenship by voting in an election in a foreign country, or by acquiring foreign citizenship, if they did not intend to lose United States citizenship. United States citizens who have dual citizenship do not lose their United States citizenship unless they renounce it officially.  History of citizenship in the United States  A Welcome to United States Citizenship ‚Äì Pub. M-76 (rev. 09/1970) Citizenship began in colonial times as an active relation between men working cooperatively to solve municipal problems and participating actively in democratic decision-making, such as in New England town hall meetings. Men met regularly to discuss local affairs and make decisions. These town meetings were described as the \\"earliest form of American democracy\\" which was vital since citizen participation in public affairs helped keep democracy \\"sturdy\\", according to Alexis de Tocqueville in 1835. A variety of forces changed this relation during the nation's history. Citizenship became less defined by participation in politics and more defined as a legal relation with accompanying rights and privileges. While the realm of civic participation in the public sphere has shrunk, the citizenship franchise has been expanded to include not just propertied white adult men but black menNote: after the Emancipation Proclamation during the American Civil War, blacks became technically enfranchised as citizens although segregation and discrimination did not begin to break down until the twentieth century and adult women.Note: women achieved the right to vote in 1919 after a constitutional amendment. The Supreme Court affirmed in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, , that per the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause an ethnic Chinese person born in the United States becomes a citizen. This is distinct from naturalized citizenship; in 1922 the Court held in Ozawa v. United States, , that a Japanese person, born in Japan but resident in the United States for twenty years, could not be naturalized under the law of the time and in 1923 in United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, , that an Indian person could not be naturalized. In the Ozawa decision it was noted that \\"In all of the naturalization acts from 1790 to 1906 the privilege of naturalization was confined to white persons (with the addition in 1870 of those of African nativity and descent)\\", 1906 being the most recent legislation in question at the time. The Equal Nationality Act of 1934 allowed a foreign-born child of a US citizen mother and an alien father, who had entered US territory before age 18 and lived in the United States for five years, to apply for United States citizenship for the first time. It also made the naturalization process quicker for American women's alien husbands. This law equalized expatriation, immigration, naturalization, and repatriation rules between women and men. However, it was not applied retroactively, and was modified by later laws, such as the Nationality Act of 1940.  Birthright citizenship  United States citizenship is usually acquired by birth when a child is born within the territory of the United States. In addition to the 50 U.S. states, this includes the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands and the United States Virgin Islands.See 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1101(a)(36) and 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1101(a)(38) Providing the term \\"State\\" and \\"United States\\" definitions on the United States Federal Code, Immigration and Nationality Act. , , , , , , , , , , Citizenship, however, was not specified in the original Constitution. In 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment specifically defined persons who were either born or naturalized in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction as citizens. All babies born in the United States ‚Äî except those born to enemy aliens in wartime or the children of foreign diplomats‚Äîenjoy United States citizenship under the Supreme Court's long- standing interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The amendment states: \\"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\\" There remains dispute as to who is \\"subject to the jurisdiction\\" of the United States at birth.See Birthright citizenship in the United States#Current controversy. By acts of Congress, every person born in Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands is a United States citizen by birth.8 U.S.C. secs. 1402 (Puerto Rico), 1406 (Virgin Islands), and 1407 (Guam); 48 U.S.C. sec. 1801, US-NMI Covenant sec. 303 (Northern Mariana Islands). Also, every person born in the former Panama Canal Zone whose father or mother (or both) are or were a citizen is a United States citizen by birth.8 U.S.C. sec. 1403. Regardless of where they are born, children of United States citizens are United States citizens in most cases. Children born outside the United States with at least one United States citizen parent usually have birthright citizenship by parentage. A child of unknown parentage found in the United States while under the age of 5 is considered a US citizen until proven, before reaching the age of 22, to have not been born in the US. While persons born in the United States are considered to be citizens and can have passports, children under age eighteen are legally considered to be minors and cannot vote or hold office. Upon the event of their eighteenth birthday, they are considered full citizens but there is no ceremony acknowledging this relation or any correspondence between the new citizen and the government to this effect. Citizenship is assumed to exist, and the relation is assumed to remain viable until death or until it is renounced or dissolved by some other legal process. Secondary schools ideally teach the basics of citizenship and create \\"informed and responsible citizens\\" who are \\"skilled in the arts of effective deliberation and action.\\" Americans who live in foreign countries and become members of other governments have, in some instances, been stripped of citizenship, although there have been court cases where decisions regarding citizenship have been reversed.  Naturalized citizenship  Acts of Congress provide for acquisition of citizenship by persons born abroad.  Agency in charge  Albert Einstein received his certificate of American citizenship from Judge Phillip Forman. The agency in charge of admitting new citizens is the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, commonly abbreviated as USCIS. It is a bureau of the Department of Homeland Security. It offers web-based services. The agency depends on application fees for revenue; in 2009, with a struggling economy, applications were down sharply, and consequently there was much less revenue to upgrade and streamline services. There was speculation that if the administration of president Barack Obama passed immigration reform measures, then the agency could face a \\"welcome but overwhelming surge of Americans-in- waiting\\" and longer processing times for citizenship applications. The USCIS has made efforts to digitize records. A USCIS website says the \\"United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is committed to offering the best possible service to you, our customer\\" and which says \\"With our focus on customer service, we offer you a variety of services both before and after you file your case\\". The website allowed applicants to estimate the length of time required to process specific types of cases, to check application status, and to access a customer guide. The USCIS processes cases in the order they're received.  Pathways to citizenship  U.S. Navy sailor receives his certificate of United States citizenship from the commander of the . People applying to become citizens must satisfy certain requirements. For example, there have been requirements that applicants have been permanent residents for five years (three if married to a United States citizen), be of \\"good moral character\\" (meaning no felony convictions), be of \\"sound mind\\" in the judgment of immigration officials, have knowledge of the Constitution, and be able to speak and understand English unless they are elderly or disabled. Applicants must also pass a simple citizenship test. Until recently, a test published by the Immigration and Naturalization Service asked questions such as \\"How many stars are there in our flag?\\" and \\"What is the Constitution?\\" and \\"Who is the president of the United States today?\\" At one point, the Government Printing Office sold flashcards for US$8.50 to help test takers prepare for the test. In 2006, the government replaced the former trivia test with a ten-question oral test designed to \\"shun simple historical facts about America that can be recounted in a few words, for more explanation about the principles of American democracy, such as freedom\\". One reviewer described the new citizenship test as \\"thoughtful\\". While some have criticized the new version of the test, officials counter that the new test is a \\"teachable moment\\" without making it conceptually more difficult, since the list of possible questions and answers, as before, will be publicly available. Six correct answers constitutes a passing grade. The new test probes for signs that immigrants \\"understand and share American values\\". A unique way to become a permanent resident is to apply to the US government Diversity Visa (DV) lottery. This program is a drawing for foreigners to apply for a drawing to become a permanent resident. * Military participation is often a way for immigrant residents to become citizens. Since many people seek citizenship for its financial and social benefits, the promise of citizenship can be seen as a means of motivating persons to participate in dangerous activities such as fight in wars. For example, a 2009 article in The New York Times said that the United States Military was recruiting \\"skilled immigrants who are living in this country with temporary visas\\" by promising an opportunity to become citizens \\"in as little as six months\\" in exchange for service in Afghanistan and Iraq where United States forces are \\"stretched thin\\". The option was not open to illegal immigrants. One estimate was that in 2009 the US military had 29,000 foreign-born people currently serving who were not American citizens. Spouses of citizens or non-citizens who served in the military also have less difficulty becoming citizens. One analyst noted that \\"many immigrants, not yet citizens, have volunteered to serve in the United States military forces ... Some have been killed and others wounded ... Perhaps this can be seen as a cynical attempt to qualify more easily for United States citizenship ... But I think that service in the United States military has to be taken as a pretty serious commitment to the United States\\". Immigrant soldiers who fight for the United States often have an easier and faster path to citizenship. In 2002, President Bush signed an executive order to eliminate the three-year waiting period and made service personnel immediately eligible for citizenship. In 2003, Congress voted to \\"cut the waiting period to become a citizen from three years down to one year\\" for immigrants who had served in the armed forces. In 2003, of 1.4 million service members, 37,000 active-duty members were not citizens, and of these, 20% had applied for citizenship. By June 2003, 12 non- citizens had died fighting for the United States in the Iraqi war. The military has had a tradition of \\"filling out its ranks\\" with aliens living in the United States Non-citizens fought in World War II. The military has struggled to \\"fill its depleted ranks\\" by recruiting more non-United States citizens. * Grandparent rule. Section 322 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA), added in 1994, enabled children of a United States citizen who did not get citizenship at birth, to use the physical presence period in the United States of a grandparent who was a citizen to qualify for United States citizenship. Under the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, Section 322 was amended to extend also to children who generally reside outside the United States with a United States citizen parent, whether biological or adopted. The child must be in the legal and physical custody of the United States citizen parent, the child and parent must be lawfully present in the United States for the interview, and the child must take the oath of allegiance before the age of 18 years (for those 14 years or older). The application (Form N-600K) may only be submitted by the United States citizen parent, or by the grandparent or legal guardian within 5 years of the parent's death. In 2006, there were 4,000 applications of citizenship using the physical presence of grandparents. Israel is comprise 90% of those taking advantage of the clause.  Strong demand  According to a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, \\"citizenship is a very, very valuable commodity\\". However, one study suggested legal residents eligible for citizenship, but who don't apply, tend to have low incomes (41%), do not speak English well (60%), or have low levels of education (25%). There is strong demand for citizenship based on the number of applications filed. From 1920 to 1940, the number of immigrants to the United States who became citizens numbered about 200,000 each year; there was a spike after World War II, and then the level reduced to about 150,000 per year until resuming to the 200,000 level beginning about 1980. In the mid-1990s to 2009, the levels rose to about 500,000 per year with considerable variation. In 1996, more than one million people became citizens through naturalization. In 1997, there were 1.41 million applications filed; in 2006, 1.38 million. The number of naturalized citizens in the United States rose from 6.5 million in the mid-1990s to 11 million in 2002. By 2003, the pool of immigrants eligible to become naturalized citizens was 8 million, and of these, 2.7 million lived in California. In 2003, the number of new citizens from naturalization was 463,204. In 2007, the number was 702,589. In 2007, 1.38 million people applied for citizenship creating a backlog. In 2008, applications decreased to 525,786. Naturalization fees were US$60 in 1989; US$90 in 1991; US$95 in 1994; US$225 in 1999; US$260 in 2002; US$320 in 2003; US$330 in 2005. In 2007 application fees were increased from US$330 to US$595 and an additional US$80 computerized fingerprinting fee was added. The biometrics fee was increased to US$85 in 2010. On December 23, 2014, the application fees were increased again from US$595 to US$640. The high fees have been criticized as putting up one more wall to citizenship. Increases in fees for citizenship have drawn criticism. Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute and former Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner, doubted that fee increases deter citizenship-seekers. In 2009, the number of immigrants applying for citizenship plunged 62%; reasons cited were the slowing economy and the cost of naturalization.  Citizenship ceremonies  December 21, 1973 Congress Hall Program and Welcome Letter from Pres. Richard Nixon The citizenship process has been described as a ritual that is meaningful for many immigrants. Many new citizens are sworn in during Independence Day ceremonies. Most citizenship ceremonies take place at offices of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. However, one swearing-in ceremony was held at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia in 2008. The judge who chose this venue explained: \\"I did it to honor our country's warriors and to give the new citizens a sense for what makes this country great\\". According to federal law, citizenship applicants who are also changing their names must appear before a federal judge.  Honorary citizenship  Polish Count Kazimierz Pulaski was awarded with the honorary distinction of citizen 230 years after he fought and died in the Revolutionary War. The title of \\"Honorary Citizen of the United States\\" has been granted eight times by an act of Congress or by a proclamation issued by the president pursuant to authorization granted by Congress. The eight individuals are Sir Winston Churchill, Raoul Wallenberg, William Penn, Hannah Callowhill Penn, Mother Teresa, the Marquis de Lafayette, Casimir Pulaski, and Bernardo de G√°lvez y Madrid, Viscount of Galveston and Count of G√°lvez. Sometimes, the government awarded non-citizen immigrants who died fighting for American forces with the posthumous title of United States citizen, but this is not considered honorary citizenship. In June 2003, Congress approved legislation to help families of fallen non-citizen soldiers.  Corporate citizenship  There is a sense in which corporations can be considered \\"citizens\\". Since corporations are considered persons in the eyes of the law, it is possible to think of corporations as being like citizens. For example, the airline Virgin America asked the United States Department of Transportation to be treated as an American air carrier. The advantage of \\"citizenship\\" is having the protection and support of the United States government when jockeying with foreign governments for access to air routes and overseas airports. Alaska Airlines, a competitor of Virgin America, asked for a review of the situation; according to United States law, \\"foreign ownership in a United States air carrier is limited to 25% of the voting interest in the carrier\\", but executives at Virgin America insisted the airline met this requirement. For the purposes of diversity jurisdiction in the United States civil procedure, corporate citizenship is determined by the principal place of business of the corporation. There is some degree of disagreement among legal authorities as to how exactly this may be determined. Another sense of \\"corporate citizenship\\" is a way to show support for causes such as social issues and the environment and, indirectly, gain a kind of \\"reputational advantage\\".  Distinction between citizenship and nationality  The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA) made a minor distinction between United States citizenship and United States nationality. (\\"The term 'national of the United States' means (A) a citizen of the United States, or (B) a person who, though not a citizen of the United States, owes permanent allegiance to the United States.\\"); Miller v. Albright, 523 U.S. 420, 423-24 (1998) (\\"Persons not born in the United States acquire [United States citizenship or American nationality] by birth only as provided by Acts of Congress\\".); Jaen v.

It is well-established that all United States citizens are United States nationals but not all United States nationals are United States citizens. The Naturalization Act of 1790 () provided the first rules to be followed by the United States in the granting of national citizenship after the ratification of the Constitution. A number of other Acts and statutes followed the Act of 1790 that expanded or addressed specific situations but it was not until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (), codified under Title 8 of the United States Code (), that the variety of statutes governing citizenship law were organized within one single body of text. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 set forth the legal requirements for the acquisition of American nationality. The Fourteenth Amendment (1868) addressed citizenship rights. The United States nationality law, despite its \\"nationality\\" title, comprises the statutes that embody the law regarding both American citizenship and American nationality. The United States government takes the position that unincorporated territories of the United States are not \\"in the United States\\" for purposes of the Citizenship Clause, and thus individuals born in those territories are only United States citizens at birth if Congress has passed a citizenship statute in regards to that territory. Thus, people born in Puerto Rico, Guam, and the United States Virgin Islands have United States citizenship at birth, while people born in the Northern Mariana Islands have United States citizenship at birth but may elect to give up United States citizenship while retaining United States nationality at the age of 18.8 FAM 308.3 Non-Citizen U.S. Nationality in The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

Controversies  The issue of citizenship naturalization is a highly contentious matter in United States politics, particularly regarding illegal immigrants. Candidates in the 2008 presidential election, such as Rudolph Giuliani, tried to \\"carve out a middle ground\\" on the issue of illegal immigration, but rivals such as John McCain advocated legislation requiring illegal immigrants to first leave the country before being eligible to apply as citizens. Some measures to require proof of citizenship upon registering to vote have met with controversy. Controversy can arise when citizenship affects political issues. Whether to include questions about current citizenship status in the United States Census questions has been debated in the Senate. Census data affects state electoral clout; it also affects budgetary allocations. Including non-citizens in Census counts also shifts political power to states that have large numbers of non- citizens due to the fact that reapportionment of congressional seats is based on Census data, and including non-citizens in the census is mandated by the United States Constitution.Census Nonsense, Los Angeles Times, May 29, 2010; see also, Steve Camarota, Remaking the Political Landscape: The Impact of Illegal and Legal Immigration on Congressional Apportionment Center for Immigration Studies, October 2003. There have been controversies based on speculation about which way newly naturalized citizens are likely to vote. Since immigrants from many countries have been presumed to vote Democratic if naturalized, there have been efforts by Democratic administrations to streamline citizenship applications before elections to increase turnout; Republicans, in contrast, have exerted pressure to slow down the process. In 1997, there were efforts to strip the citizenship of 5,000 newly approved immigrants who, it was thought, had been \\"wrongly naturalized\\"; a legal effort to do this presented enormous challenges. An examination by the Immigration and Naturalization Service of 1.1 million people who were granted citizenship from September 1995 to September 1996 found 4,946 cases in which a criminal arrest should have disqualified an applicant or in which an applicant lied about his or her criminal history. Before the 2008 election, there was controversy about the speed of the USCIS in processing applications; one report suggested that the agency would complete 930,000 applications in time for the newly processed citizens to vote in the November 2008 election. Foreign-born naturalized citizens tend to vote at the same rates as natives. For example, in the state of New Jersey in the 2008 election, the foreign born represented 20.1% of the state's population of 8,754,560; of these, 636,000 were eighteen or older and hence eligible to vote; of eligible voters, 396,000 actually voted, which was about 62%. So foreign-born citizens vote in roughly the same proportion (62%) as native citizens (67%). Note: click on \\"New Jersey\\" MPI election profiles for all 50 states and the District of Columbia, examining voter registration by nativity, providing breakdowns for foreign- born citizens as a share of total state population, and detailing their turnout in the 2004 general election, and by ethnicity. There has been controversy about the agency in charge of citizenship. The USCIS has been criticized as being a \\"notoriously surly, inattentive bureaucracy\\" with long backlogs in which \\"would-be citizens spent years waiting for paperwork\\". Rules made by Congress and the federal government regarding citizenship are highly technical and often confusing, and the agency is forced to cope with enforcement within a complex regulatory milieu. There have been instances in which applicants for citizenship have been deported on technicalities. One Pennsylvania doctor and his wife, both from the Philippines, who applied for citizenship, and one Mr. Darnell from Canada who was married to an American with two children from this marriage, ran afoul of legal technicalities and faced deportation. The New York Times reported that \\"Mr. Darnell discovered that a 10-year-old conviction for domestic violence involving a former girlfriend, even though it had been reduced to a misdemeanor and erased from his public record, made him ineligible to become a citizen ‚Äî or even to continue living in the United States\\". Overworked federal examiners under pressure to make \\"quick decisions\\" as well as \\"weed out security risks\\" have been described as preferring \\"to err on the side of rejection\\". In 2000, 399,670 applications were denied (about of all applications); in 2007, 89,683 applications for naturalization were denied, about 12% of those presented. Generally, eligibility for citizenship is denied for the millions of people living in the United States illegally, although from time to time, there have been amnesties. In 2006, there were mass protests numbering hundreds of thousands of people throughout the United States demanding United States citizenship for illegal immigrants. Many carried banners which read \\"We Have A Dream Too\\". One estimate is that there were 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States in 2006. Many American high school students have citizenship issues. In 2008, it was estimated that there were 65,000 illegal immigrant students. The number was less clear for post-secondary education. A 1982 Supreme Court decision, Plyler v. Doe , entitled illegal immigrants to free education from kindergarten through high school. Undocumented immigrants who get arrested face difficulties in the courtroom as they have no constitutional right to challenge the outcome of their deportation hearings. In 2009, writer Tom Barry of the Boston Review criticized the crackdown against illegal immigrants since it \\"flooded the federal courts with nonviolent offenders, besieged poor communities, and dramatically increased the United States prison population, while doing little to solve the problem itself\\". Barry criticized the United States' high incarceration rate as being \\"fives times greater than the average rate in the rest of the world\\". Virginia senator Jim Webb agreed that \\"we are doing something dramatically wrong in our criminal justice system\\".  Relinquishment of citizenship  Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the United States, issued by the United States Embassy in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay. According to the document, the subject had acquired no other nationality at the time of issuance; hence leaving him stateless. United States citizens can relinquish their citizenship, which involves abandoning the right to reside in the United States and all the other rights and responsibilities of citizenship. \\"Relinquishment\\" is the legal term covering all seven different potentially-expatriating acts (ways of giving up citizenship) under . \\"Renunciation\\" refers to two of those acts: swearing an oath of renunciation before a United States diplomatic or consular officer abroad, or before an official designated by the attorney general within the United States during a state of war. Out of an estimated three to six million United States citizens residing abroad, between five and six thousand relinquished citizenship each year in 2015 and 2016. United States nationality law treats people who performs potentially-expatriating acts with intent to give up United States citizenship as ceasing to be United States citizens from the moment of the act, but United States tax law since 2004 treats such individuals as though they remain United States citizens until they notify the State Department and apply for a Certificate of Loss of Nationality (CLN). Renunciation requires an oath to be sworn before a State Department officer and thus involves in-person attendance at an embassy or consulate, but applicants for CLNs on the basis of other potentially-expatriating acts must attend an in-person interview as well. During the interview, a State Department official assesses whether the person acted voluntarily, intended to abandon all rights of United States citizenship, and understands the consequences of their actions. The State Department strongly recommends that Americans intending to relinquish citizenship have another citizenship, but will permit Americans to make themselves stateless if they understand the consequences. There is a US$2,350 administrative fee for the process. In addition, an expatriation tax is imposed on some individuals relinquishing citizenship, but payment of the tax is not a legal prerequisite for relinquishing citizenship; rather, the tax and its associated forms are due on the normal tax due date of the year following relinquishment of citizenship. State Department officials do not seek to obtain any tax information from the interviewee, and instruct the interviewee to contact the IRS directly with any questions about taxes.  Revocation of citizenship  Citizenship can be revoked under certain circumstances.https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim- title8-section1451#=0&edition;=prelim For instance, if held that a naturalized person has concealed material evidence, wilfully misrepresented themselves, not disclosed being a member of certain political parties like the Communist Party of America or the Nazi party, etc., then they may have their naturalization revoked. A citizen may also lose United States citizenship when they perform such expatriating acts like seeking office in a foreign state.https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal- considerations/Advice-about-Possible-Loss-of-US-Nationality-Dual- Nationality/Loss-US-Nationality-Foreign-State.html Generally, the higher office and more important role a citizen holds in a foreign government, the more at risk the United States citizenship will be: \\"Serving as a foreign head of state/government or foreign minister may affect the level of immunity from United States jurisdiction that a dual national may be afforded. All such cases should be referred to the Office of the Assistant Legal Adviser for Consular Affairs\\". From September 22, 1922 to the passage of Nationality Act of 1940, a woman holding United States citizenship could lose it simply by marriage to an alien or certain aliens ineligible for citizenship.http://library.uwb.edu/Static/USimmigration/54%20stat%201137.pdfhttps://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC- prelim-title8-section1435#=0&edition;=prelim  See also  * Accidental American * Anchor baby * Birth tourism * Birthright citizenship in the United States of America * Birthright generation * Citizenship (general discussion for all nations) * Citizenship education * DREAM Act * History of citizenship * Jus soli * Natural born citizen of the United States * Undocumented students in the United States * Undocumented youth in the United States * United States nationality law  References   Footnotes   External links  * Citizenship and the American Empire, Noted on the Legislative History of the Unites States Citizenship of Puerto Ricans Citizenship United States federal immigration and nationality legislation United States nationality law Citizenship ","title":"Citizenship of the United States"},{"id":"25151579","text":"Heaven & Earth is a computer game developed by Software Resources International and published by Buena Vista Software in 1992.

Antebellum period Henry Marshall was born in Darlington District, South Carolina on December 28, 1805. He was a cousin of future Confederate general Maxcy Gregg and attended Union College at Schenectady, New York. While a student there, Marshall walked from Philadelphia to his home in Society Hill, leaving a diary of the journey. He moved to Louisiana in the mid-1830s to seek cheap land in the west, and settled in DeSoto Parish. There, Marshall became a planter, owning 8,000 acres of land and 201 slaves with property valued at over $200,000 by 1860, making him extremely wealthy by contemporary standards. He also served as a member of the Louisiana State Senate.  American Civil War  In January 1861, Marshall signed the state secession ordinance. He soon defeated Benjamin Lewis Hodge for election as a delegate to the Montgomery Constitutional Convention that became the Provisional Congress by eight votes. In November he narrowly won a contest for reelection to the 1st Confederate Congress. During this period he funded a South Carolina regiment organized by Gregg. In the Confederate Congress, Marshall served as chairman of the Committee on Public Lands. An extreme advocate of states' rights, he refused to moderate his views despite the conditions of the war, unlike other Louisiana congressmen, and in contrast to the latter was reluctant to grant President Jefferson Davis new powers. Marshall opposed direct taxation and federal control over commerce and transport and desired to man the army through state levies rather than central government conscription and give states control of the appointment of officers and service exemptions. Possibly because his views were not in accord with the war situation, Marshall declined to run for reelection in 1863 and retired to his plantation, Land's End, where he died on July 13, 1864. He was buried in Trinity Cemetery near Gloster, Louisiana.

He owned cotton plantations in Mississippi and Arkansas, and he served as a judge in the Mississippi legislature from 1856 to 1858. An advocate of the Confederate States of America, he served in the First Confederate Congress from 1862 to 1864. During the American Civil War, he was in charge of Confederate cotton in Mississippi as well as sections of Alabama and Louisiana. After the war, he moved to Memphis, Tennessee, and he served in the Mississippi State Senate from 1878 to 1880. Early life Jeremiah Watkins Clapp was born on September 24, 1814 in Abingdon, Virginia. His father, Dr Earl B. Clapp, was a surgeon from Virginia. His mother, Elizabeth Craig, was the daughter of Captain Robert Craig; she was of Scotch-Irish descent. Clapp was educated at the Abingdon Academy. He graduated from Hampden‚ÄìSydney College in 1835. After clerking for J. W. C. Watson in Abingdon, he was admitted to the bar in 1839. Career Clapp practised the Law in Abingdon, Virginia, from 1839 to 1841. He moved his practise to Holly Springs, Mississippi in 1841. He was also the owner of large Southern plantations with African slaves in Mississippi and Arkansas. Clapp was a Whig until 1850, when he joined the States' Rights Party. From 1856 to 1858, he served as a judge in the Mississippi House of Representatives, representing Marshall County, Mississippi. During the 1860 presidential campaign, he was an elector for John C. Breckinridge's campaign. At the outset of the Civil War, Clapp attended the Mississippi Secession Convention in favor of the Confederate States of America. He represented the state of Mississippi in the First Confederate Congress from 1862 to 1864. To assist the Confederate States Army, Clapp was asked by Christopher Memminger, the Confederate Secretary of the Treasury, to oversee cotton production in Mississippi as well as parts of Alabama and Louisiana. Clapp would ensure that cotton be turned into Confederate uniforms and sent to Richmond, Virginia, where General Richard Taylor distributed them. Clapp served in this capacity until Union General Edward Canby forced him to hand over the cotton in New Orleans, Louisiana. Meanwhile, Clapp turned down Canby's offer to serve in the same capacity for the Union Army. Clapp moved his legal practise to Memphis, Tennessee in 1866. During the 1876 presidential election, he was an elector for Samuel J. Tilden. From 1878 to 1880, he served in the Mississippi State Senate. Personal life Oakleigh in Holly Springs, Mississippi. Clapp married Evelina D. Lucas, the daughter of Colonel P. W. Lucas, in May 1843. They resided at Oakleigh, a mansion built for them in Holly Springs, Mississippi in 1858, and later in Memphis. They had eight children, including W. L. Clapp, who served as the Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives from 1887 to 1891, and as the Mayor of Memphis, Tennessee from 1895 to 1898. Clapp became a Master Mason in Abingdon, Virginia in 1836. He attended the Presbyterian church in Holly Springs, and the Second Presbyterian Church in Memphis.

After thirty-four years of service, she was sold to the Mexican Navy, where she was still in service as of 2009. World War II Cocopa was named after an Arizona Indian tribe. She began her naval career with the Atlantic fleet during the waning months of World War II, making two passages across the Atlantic with barges in tow, followed by a third passage to Trinidad. Her second convoy was attacked by a German U-boat, with Cocopa barely escaping destruction. Cocopa was next ordered to the Pacific theater, witnessing the final days of the war between July and August of that year. V-J day found the ship in Leyte, Philippines. Interwar service Following World War II, Cocopa shuttled between the Philippines, Shanghai, Okinawa and Hong Kong on occupation duty, before returning to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in January 1947 for an overhaul. From 1948‚Äì49 she plied Alaskan waters. In June 1951, having returned to the Far East, Cocopa accepted what many writers have termed the last Japanese surrender from World War II. Lieutenant Commander James B. Johnson accepted the capitulation of nineteen Japanese soldiers who had been living on the island of Anatahan, in the Northern Mariana Islands. The ship repatriated these men and their personal effects to Guam, from whence they were ultimately returned to Japan. However, other Japanese holdouts continued to surrender over the next few decades, though in much smaller numbers. Korean War Cocopa saw action in the Korean War during the summer of 1953. During this period she served off both Korean coasts; in one operation, she towed , a Royal Canadian Navy destroyer that had run aground on the island of Pang Yang-Do, just off the North Korean coast well north of enemy-held Wonsan harbor. At the time of the armistice, she went to Wonsan to aid in the removal of a Marine garrison occupying a small islet at the harbor's mouth. During the Korean War, USS Cocopa received one battle star for her service. After the war, Cocopa conducted numerous Pacific Ocean and Alaskan cruises. Her home port was changed from Pearl Harbor to San Diego in 1961. Operation Castle In March 1954, Cocopa was one of the ships tasked to support Operation Castle, a series of high-energy (high-yield) nuclear tests by Joint Task Force SEVEN (JTF-7) at Bikini Atoll. Official reports indicated that crewmembers suffered the highest doses (2.2 rem) of radiation endured by any of the navy ships present at this operation. Vietnam War USS Cocopa in Vietnamese waters in 1967. During the Vietnam War, Cocopa saw service in five campaigns: Advisory (1963), Vietnam Defense (1965), Counteroffensive Phase II (1967), Summer-Fall 1969, and Ceasefire (1972). In 1965, Cocopa hosted Detachment Charlie of Beach Jumpers Unit One, Team Twelve, operating as the \\"Yankee Station Special Surveillance Unit\\". This outfit consisted of one officer and five enlisted men, whose mission was to jam Soviet electronic intelligence trawlers monitoring U.S. operations in the Gulf of Tonkin. Team members utilized random wave jamming with noises (including bagpipe recordings) to counteract Russian SIGINT activities. Cocopa also assisted in towing, recovery and similar operations throughout her tours in Vietnam.

It is a clone of Sega's Columns. Jewelbox was originally published as shareware, in 1992, and was developed by Rodney and Brenda Jacks, with music by Jim Holt. After its initial release, Jewelbox was published as a commercial game by Varcon Systems. The commercial version added many new features including support for different display sizes and more powerups including the ability to collect and play wildcard jewels whenever you wanted. Varcon sold the game individually and as part of a three-game package of arcade challenges. Gameplay Colored gems fall from the top of the screen, and the player must manipulate them to form patterns that erase themselves. When the playing area fills up with gems, the round is over. Special gems cause different things to happen. The player must manipulate the jewels to form lines of three or more horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Jewels are affected by gravity, allowing the player to set up chain reactions which multiply the value of the gems matched. When the playing area is filled, it is cleared and the player loses one life - unlike Tetris, the player is given three lives in each game, and the opportunity to earn additional lives by reaching points milestones. Gems are worth different numbers of points, with black onyx-like stones being the most valuable. The game includes an easter egg where matching three black jewels on the bottom row of the play area resulted in a huge points bonus. Reception The game was reviewed in 1994 in Dragon #211 by Jay & Dee in the \\"Eye of the Monitor\\" column. Jay did not rate the game, but Dee gave the game 3¬Ω out of 5 stars. Dee noted that the gameplay is vaguely similar to that of Tetris, but that \\"Jewelbox is not just a clone‚Äîit has intriguing rules all its own, including special gems that cause amazing things to happen, and beautiful sound and graphics\\". Laurel Clyde, in the book Managing Infotech in School Library Media Centers mentions Jewelbox as one of the games \\"that pay homage to Tetris while extending the concept in new directions\\". Larry Hanson, in his book Everything You Wanted to Know About the Mac, said that Jewelbox \\"deserves special praise, not only for its nice graphics and music, but also for its packaging. Instead of the shelf-hogging cardboard boxes most games come packed in, Jewelbox (like Varcon's other games) comes in a re-useable suede bag.\\" Legacy Update as of 9/18/2011: Jewelbox for iOS and Android is currently under development and will be published by Hot Rod Games (Rodney Jacks).

He is currently the Virginia Hobbs Carpenter Research Fellow in Journalism at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, and a contributing editor at POLITICO Europe. Early life and education Tunku Varadarajan was born in Delhi, India. His earliest years were spent in New York, where he attended The Town School. He later attended Mayo College in Ajmer, Rajasthan, India with his brother Siddharth Varadarajan, as well as Dulwich College, London. After high school, he attended Trinity College, Oxford University from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in law in 1984. Career After six years as a lecturer in law, Tunku Varadarajan left Oxford in 1993 to join The Times as a leader (editorial) writer under the editor, Peter Stothard. He specialized in international affairs, law, society, and culture. In 1996, he moved to Spain as the newspaper's Madrid bureau chief. In 1997, he was named the newspaper's New York City bureau chief. In 2000, Varadarajan joined the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, under its editor, Robert L. Bartley. He worked there as a senior editorial writer, deputy editorial features editor, chief television and media critics, and, for five years, as the paper's editorial features (\\"op-ed\\") editor (a post to which he was appointed by the paper's editorial page editor, Paul A. Gigot.) In 2007, he served briefly as assistant managing editor of the Wall Street Journal, before joining New York University's Stern School of Business as a clinical professor. He was, concurrently, executive editor for opinions at Forbes Magazine, where he radically revamped the opinion section of Forbes.com. In 2009, Varadarajan left Forbes for The Daily Beast, where he was appointed writer-at-large, tasked with writing opinion columns on politics, foreign affairs, and American culture. When Newsweek merged with The Daily Beast in December 2010, Varadarajan was named editor of Newsweek International by editor-in-chief Tina Brown. In December 2012, he became the first editor of Newsweek Global, the all-digital publication that took the place of the magazine's print edition. He resigned from that job in late April 2013. Varadarajan has been associated with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University for several years, most recently as the Virginia Hobbs Carpenter Research Fellow in Journalism. He is the editor of Defining Ideas, a Hoover Institution publication. He has also been an adjunct professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism; the City University of New York's Graduate School of Journalism; and the Department of Journalism at New York University, where he is currently a Distinguished Visiting Scholar. Controversies In November 2009, subsequent to the Fort Hood shooting, Forbes.com published an article by Varadarajan titled \\"Going Muslim\\", a play on the colloquial American phrase \\"Going Postal\\". The opinion essay prompted some controversy, including political objections from some students at New York University, where he was a clinical professor, as well as in the media. NYU President John Sexton condemned the remarks as offensive. In the article \\"Is Your Professor an Islamophobe?\\", Columbia University epidemiologist and HuffPost contributor, Abdul El-Sayed, quoted Varadarajan's article, among others, when he discussed phenomenon of \\"a growing number of academics using (their) intellectual identity to promote intolerance and xenophobia against Islam and Muslims\\". Personal life A British citizen, Varadarajan lives in Brooklyn, New York, United States with his wife Amy Finnerty and their three children. He is a member of the Century Association in New York, and is on the Media Advisory Committee of AmeriCares.

Although comics and graphic novels have been generally dismissed as less relevant pop culture texts, scholars in fields such as semiotics, aesthetics, sociology, composition studies and cultural studies are now re-considering comics and graphic novels as complex texts deserving of serious scholarly study. Not to be confused with the technical aspects of comics creation, comics studies exists only with the creation of comics theory‚Äîwhich approaches comics critically as an art‚Äîand the writing of comics historiography (the study of the history of comics).Beno√Æt Crucifix, \\"Redrawing Comics into the Graphic Novel: Comics Historiography, Canonization, and Authors' Histories of the Medium\\", \\"Whither comics studies?\\" panel, International conference of the French Association for American Studies, Toulouse (France), May 24‚Äì27, 2016.

Comics studies is also interrelated with comics criticism, the analysis and evaluation of comics and the comics medium.Bramlett, Frank, Roy Cook and Aaron Meskin (eds.), The Routledge Companion to Comics, Routledge, 2016, p. 330. Theorizing comics Although there has been the occasional investigation of comics as a valid art form, specifically in Gilbert Seldes' The 7 Lively Arts (1924), Martin Sheridan's Comics and Their Creators (1942), and David Kunzle's The Early Comic Strip: Narrative Strips and Picture Stories in the European Broadsheet from c. 1450 to 1825 (1973), contemporary Anglophone comics studies in North America can be said to have burst onto the academic scene with both Will Eisner's Comics and Sequential Art in 1985 and Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics in 1993. Continental comics studies can trace its roots back to the pioneering work of semioticians such as Roland Barthes (particularly his 1964 essay \\"Rhetoric of the Image\\", published in English in the anthology Image‚ÄîMusic‚ÄîText)Roland Barthes, \\"Rh√©torique de l'image\\", Communications 4(1), 1964, pp. 40‚Äì51, translated as \\"Rhetoric of the Image\\", in: Roland Barthes, Image‚ÄìMusic‚ÄìText, essays selected and translated by Stephen Heath, New York 1977, pp. 32‚Äì51. and Umberto Eco (particularly his 1964 book Apocalittici e integrati).Umberto Eco, Apocalittici e integrati: comunicazioni di massa e teorie della cultura di massa, Bompiani, 1964. Cf. also: Umberto Eco (1972). \\"Epilogue\\", in: Walter Herdeg and David Pascal (eds.): The Art of the Comic Strip, Zurich: The Graphis Press. These works were the first attempts at a general system of comics semiotics.Jochen Ecke, Gideon Haberkorn (eds.), Comics as a Nexus of Cultures: Essays on the Interplay of Media, McFarland, 2010, p. 238. More recently, analysis of comics have begun to be undertaken by cognitive scientists, the most prominent being Neil Cohn, who has used tools from linguistics to detail the theoretical structure of comics' underlying \\"visual language\\", and has also used psychological experimentation from cognitive neuroscience to test these theories in actual comprehension. This work has suggested similarities between the way that the brain processes language and the way it processes sequential images.Neil Cohn, The Visual Language of Comics: Introduction to the Structure and Cognition of Sequential Images, London: Bloomsbury, 2013, p. 1ff. Cohn's theories are not universally accepted, with other scholars like Thierry Groensteen, Hannah Miodrag, and Barbara Postema offering alternative understandings. Defining comics Cartoonist and comics theorist Scott McCloud Similar to the problems of defining literature and film, no consensus has been reached on a definition of the comics medium, and attempted definitions and descriptions have fallen prey to numerous exceptions. Theorists such as T√∂pffer, R. C. Harvey, Will Eisner, David Carrier, Alain Rey, and Lawrence Grove emphasize the combination of text and images, though there are prominent examples of pantomime comics throughout its history. Other critics, such as Thierry Groensteen and Scott McCloud, have emphasized the primacy of sequences of images. Towards the close of the 20th century, different cultures' discoveries of each other's comics traditions, the rediscovery of forgotten early comics forms, and the rise of new forms made defining comics a more complicated task. Composition studies In the field of composition studies, an interest in comics and graphic novels is growing, partially due to the work of comics theorists but also due to composition studies' growing focus on multimodality and visual rhetoric. Composition studies theorists are looking at comics as sophisticated texts, and sites of complex literacy. Gunther Kress defines multimodality as \\"the use of several semiotic modes in the design of a semiotic product or event, together with the particular way in which these mode are combined\\" or, more simply as \\"any text whose meanings are realized through more than one semiotic code\\". Kristie S. Fleckenstein sees the relationship between image and text as \\"mutually constitutive, mutually infused\\"‚Äîa relationship she names \\"imageword\\". Fleckenstein sees \\"imageword\\" as offering \\"a double vision of writing-reading based on [the] fusion of image and word, a double vision of literacy\\". Dale Jacobs sees the reading of comics as a form of \\"multimodal literacy or multiliteracy, rather than as a debased form of print literacy\\". According to Jacobs, comics can help educators to move \\"toward attending to multimodal literacies\\" that \\"shift our focus from print only to multiple modalities\\". He encourages educators to embrace a pedagogy that will give students skills to effectively negotiate these multiple modalities. Comics historiography Comics historiography (the study of the history of comics) studies the historical process through which comics became an autonomous art mediumWilliams, Paul and James Lyons (eds.), The Rise of the American Comics Artist: Creators and Contexts, University Press of Mississippi, 2010, p. 106. and an integral part of culture.Waugh, Coulton, The Comics, University Press of Mississippi, 1991, p. xiii. An area of study is premodern sequential art; some scholars such as Scott McCloud consider Egyptian paintings and pre- Columbian American picture manuscripts to be the very first form of comics and sequential art.Scott McCloud, Understanding Comics, Harper Perennial, 1993, pp. 10‚Äì15. Another area of study is the 20th-century emergence of the subculture of comics readers and comicphilia,Alexandre Linck Vargas, A inven√ß√£o dos quadrinhos: teoria e cr√≠tica da sarjeta (The Invention of Comics: Theory and Criticism of Gutters), Ph.D. thesis, Federal University of Santa Catarina, 2015, Abstract: \\"we stumble upon the inventions of a comics artistry, from the [1960s] on, through conflicts with the art world (Pop Art, Lowbrow Art and exhibitions), through the emergence of an authorial disposal and of an institutionalized comicphilia...\\" the passionate interest in comic books. (A person with a passionate interest in comics is informally called a comicphile or comics buff.)Rhoades, Shirrel, A Complete History of American Comic Books, Peter Lang, 2008, p. 66. The first attempts at comics historiography began in the United States in the 1940s with the work of Thomas Craven, Martin Sheridan, and Coulton Waugh. It was not until the mid-1960s, with the publication of Jules Feiffer's The Great Comic Book Heroes, that the field began to take root. Historiography became an accepted practice in the 1970s with the work of Maurice Horn, Jim Steranko, Ron Goulart, Bill Blackbeard, and Martin Williams. The late 1990s saw a wave of books celebrating American comics' centennial. Other notable writers on these topics include Will Jacobs, Gerard Jones, Rick Marschall, and R. C. Harvey. Educational institutions Comics studies is becoming increasingly more common at academic institutions across the world. Some notable examples include: University of Florida, University of Toronto at Mississauga,Visual Culture Studies - University of Toronto Mississauga. and University of California Santa Cruz,Spiegelman, Art. \\"Comix 101.\\" Lecture. Porter College, University of California, Santa Cruz, April 1992. among others. West Liberty University is currently the only university offering a four-year undergraduate literature degree in comics studies.Graphic Narrative Major In Britain, growing interest in comics has led to the establishment of a center for comics studies, the Scottish Centre for Comics Studies (SCCS) at the University of Dundee in Scotland. Beside formal programs and degrees, it is common to see individual courses dedicated to comics and graphic novels in many educational institutions. Sol M. Davidson's New York University thesis, Culture and the Comic Strips, earned him the first PhD in comics in 1959,Sol M. Davidson. Culture and the Comic Strips. Ph.D. diss., New York University, 1959.Sol & Penny Davison Collection - George A. Smathers Libraries. while in France, Jean-Christophe Menu was awarded a Doctorate in Art and Art Sciences in 2011 from Universit√© Paris 1 Panth√©on-Sorbonne after defending his thesis The Comics and its Double: Language and Frontiers of Comics: Practical, Theoretical and Editorial Prospects.Article about Jean-Christophe Menu presenting his thesis at the Sorbonne.Theses.fr: La bande dessin√©e et son double : langage et marges de la bande dessin√©e : perspectives pratiques, th√©oriques et √©ditoriales. Teesside University began offering a BA in Comics and Graphic Novels in 2014, as well as an MA in Comics from 2018. They have since appointed a team of renowned comics practitioners including Fionnuala Doran, Julian Lawrence, Con Chrisoulis, Nigel Kitching and Tara McInerney. The University of Lancaster started offering a PhD degree in comics studies in 2015. The same year French comics studies scholar Beno√Æt Peeters (a student of Roland Barthes) was appointed as the UK's first ever comics professor at Lancaster University. Scholarly publications Since 2000 many new scholarly journals have appeared dedicated to comics studies. Three of the most important peer refereed journals in English are: Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics, Studies in Comics, and European Comic Art. Other notable journals include: ImageTexT (a peer reviewed, open access journal that began in the spring of 2004 and is based at the University of Florida), Image and Narrative (stylized as Image [&] Narrative, a peer-reviewed e-journal on visual narratology), SANE: Sequential Art Narrative in Education (based at the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln), Inks: The Journal of the Comics Studies Society (published by the Ohio State University Press), The Comics Grid: Journal of Comics Scholarship, and the International Journal of Comic Art. Conferences Although presentations dedicated to comics are commonplace at conferences in many fields, entire conferences dedicated to this subject are becoming more common. There have been conferences at SAIC (International Comic Arts Forum, 2009), MMU (The International Bande Dessin√©e Society Conference), UTS (Sequential Art Studies Conference), Georgetown, Ohio State (Festival of Cartoon Art),\\"Regularly Held Conferences\\". and Bowling Green (Comics in Popular Culture conference),Robert G. Weiner (ed.), Graphic Novels and Comics in Libraries and Archives: Essays on Readers, Research, History and Cataloging, McFarland, 2010, p. 264. and there is a yearly conference at University of Florida (Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels). Additionally, there is an annual Michigan State University Comics Forum, which brings together academics and professionals working in the industry. Notable regularly held movable conferences include the Comic Art and Comics Area of the Popular Culture Association of America and the conference of the International Society for Humor Studies. The International Comic Arts Forum (ICAF), begun in 1995 at Georgetown University, has been described as one of the earliest academic initiatives for the study of comics. The German Gesellschaft f√ºr Comicforschung (ComFor, Society for Comics Studies) has organized yearly academic conferences since 2006. The Comics Arts Conference has met regularly since 1992 in conjunction with San Diego Comic-Con International and WonderCon.The Comics Arts Conference and Public Humanities. Another important conference is the annual International Graphic Novels and Comics Conference held since 2010 organized by British academics. This conference has been held in conjunction with the longer running International Bande Dessin√©e Society conference. Comics Forum, a UK-based community of international comics scholars, also holds an annual conference at Leeds Central Library; the first was held in 2009.

The site was once the center of a long running controversy involving the developer Capital Vision Equities, the Los Angeles City Redevelopment Agency, and the former tenants of Marlton Square. It is bordered by Martin Luther King Jr Blvd on the north, Marlton Ave on the east, Santa Rosalia Dr on the south, Angeles Vista Blvd on the southeast, Thrive Dr. on the southwest and Buckingham Road on the west. Across from the medical facility is the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, a shopping mall owned by the Cari Capital Partners Firm. Its anchor store is Macy's. History Marlton Square was created and built in the early 1950s as a retail strip mall. It was then known as Santa Barbera Plaza due do the fact it was on Santa Barbara Avenue before it was changed to Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. Redevelopment In 2003, local developers broke ground in the first phase of the Marlton Square redevelopment project. This phase involved constructing the Buckingham Place Senior Retirement Community project, a 180-unit apartment complex, that is adjacent to the Baldwin Villa Plaza senior housing complex and shopping mall. The project was scheduled to be completed in spring of 2004. Several million dollars of public and private funding have been awarded to the project. Although the redevelopment project began with concerns of political favoritism, it was billed as \\"the catalytic project for the Baldwin Hills, Crenshaw communities\\", and a lynchpin development project for the entire area. While initially promising, financial difficulties and other problems quickly beset the project. Capital Vision Equities' first check to the city bounced in 2001 and the testimony of whistle-blowers lead to an audit by the Ethics Commission early on in the project. Ultimately these problems overwhelmed the developer, and amid complaints of mismanagement the redevelopment of Marlton Square has stalled in bankruptcy. Several other agencies have been involved with the development project, including Keyshawn Capital Development, which is owned and operated by former NFL Pro Bowl wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. The old retail stores were demolished in May 2011 to make way for future development. Buckingham Place Much of the retail space in Marlton Square has been empty for several years and has fallen into disrepair. In 2008 there were no visible signs of redevelopment for that project of the retail space. By the end of 2009 Buckingham Place was largely finished but had remained unopened due to bankruptcy. However, in early 2012 Buckingham Place housing complex officially opened. Kaiser Permanente Medical It is the home to a state-of-the art 100,000 sq ft Kaiser Permanente medical facility office building. The facility has a two-mile walking path and outdoor plaza. The facility officially opened on September 7, 2017. A new shopping center complex along with new restaurants and retail stores are also being planned to be built by private developers.

The wilderness was established by Congress in 1990, as part of the Tongass Timber Reform Act. The Karta River flows from the Klawock Mountains down through Salmon and Karta Lakes to the sea. Rich and full of salmon, this artery carries the lifeblood of the Karta Valley. Attracted by its bounty, the Kaigani Haida of Kasaan fished this river and hunted the forest it supports. Later non-natives came, drawn by the same desires to hunt and fish and they built cabins, roads and mines. Today only a few cabins remain on the shores of the lakes and river so that visitors may stay for a short time and continue to seek out the heartbeat of the wilderness.

From Chesnee, South Carolina to Independence, Virginia, it connects the cities of Rutherfordton, Marion, Boone and Jefferson between the two out-of-state destinations. Its most memorable section, known as the Little Parkway Scenic Byway between Linville and Blowing Rock, offers area visitors a curvier alternative to the Blue Ridge Parkway and access to Grandfather Mountain. Route description US 221 enters from South Carolina as a rural highway, with mostly farms, wooded areas, or homes dotting the road. After it connects with US 74, where US 74 Business begins its overlap towards Rutherfordton (signs of US 74 Business are scarce throughout). At Rutherfordton, the first major intersection is Charlotte Street, where US 74 Business and US 221A go east. After Rutherfordton, the road reverts to a rural highway, and continues on to Marion. Before entering Marion city limits, I-40 intersects with US 221\\\\. US 221 then joins with NC 226, going west around the city on the Marion Bypass. After the expressway passes the shopping centers along US 70, it continues as a four-lane highway with a turning median all the way to North Cove. Along the way, several business can be seen including shrubbery farms, stone/rock cutters, and a chemical plant. NC 226 splits early at Woodlawn, for travelers that want to go to Spruce Pine. The climb to Linville Falls is somewhat curvy. It is a route heavily traveled by trucks, and a runaway truck ramp is located along this section. Also located in this section is Linville Caverns, a small tourist destination. At Linville Falls, nearby sites include Linville Gorge Wilderness, Linville Falls, (via NC 183) and the Blue Ridge Parkway. Between Linville Falls and Linville, the highway goes through large tracts of fraser fir farms, from the mountain tops to the valleys. At Linville, motorists are recommended to follow NC 105/US 221 Truck to Boone and Blowing Rock, which is faster and flatter. Those that continue on what is known as the Little Parkway Scenic Byway come upon an segment of numerous curves and elevation changes. The entrance to Grandfather Mountain is located near Linville; also nearby is the Linn Cove Viaduct, via the Blue Ridge Parkway. Those that continue along the scenic route can take a short break at the state rest area. Near Blowing Rock, visitors may also visit the Julian Price Memorial Park and Moses H. Cone Memorial Park, via Blue Ridge Parkway. Blowing Rock and Boone are popular year-round tourist destinations; as such the highway between the two towns offers an array of activities include skiing, shopping, amusement rides, and golf. In Boone, US 221 turns early along NC 105 to King Street, avoiding Appalachian State University and the downtown area; once on King Street (with US 421/NC 194 concurrency), it heads east out of town on a four-lane expressway. At Deep Gap, US 221 goes north again on a slightly curvy two-lane road to Jefferson. As the road nears West Jefferson, the road appears to open up, allowing for more views of the surrounding areas. At West Jefferson and Jefferson, the road serves as a bypass, as well as the last commercialized area along US 221 until Galax, Virginia. The next of US 221 is very curvy, similar to the stretch between Linville and Blowing Rock (minus the continuous elevation changes). Between the southern terminus of NC 93 and US 21 in Twin Oaks, US 221 is concurrent with North Carolina Bicycle Route 4. US 221 and US 21 form a concurrency north from Twin Oaks to the Virginia state line. Dedicated and memorial names Dr. Mary Martin Sloop Highway US 221 in North Carolina features a few dedicated or memorialized stretches of highway. * Dr. Mary Martin Sloop Highway - official North Carolina name of US 221 between Crossnore and Linville. It is named in honor of Dr. Mary Martin Sloop, the founder of the Crossnore School in 1913. * Robert C. Hunter Expressway - official North Carolina name of the Marion Bypass in McDowell County. It is named in honor of Robert C. Hunter, who was a judge in the North Carolina Court of Appeals (approved on November 3, 1989). * Robert G.

It is named in honor of State Trooper Robert L. (Pete) Peterson (approved on January 5, 2001). History US 321 Bus. in Blowing Rock US 221 was established in 1930, from US 19E/NC 69, in Ingalls to US 21/NC 26, in Twin Oaks; it was in complete concurrency with NC 691. In 1931, US 221 was extended north, in concurrency with US 21, into Virginia. In 1932, US 221 was removed from Ingalls/Three Mile area, which remained NC 691, and was placed on new routing south through Woodlawn, Marion, Rutherfordton, Spindale, Forest City and Cliffside, before entering South Carolina. In late 1934, the following concurrences were removed from US 221: NC 19, NC 28 and NC 207. In 1941, US 221 was rerouted south of Rutherfordton on a more direct route to Chesnee; its former alignment through Spindale-Cliffside became US 221A. Around 1953, US 221 was rerouted between Boone and Baldwin, by linking with US 421 to Deep Gap then north on new construction; the old alignment through Todd became an extension of NC 194. In 1972, US 221 was rerouted with concurrency with NC 105 to King Street in Boone, ending the US 221/US 321/US 421 intersection at Kings Street and Blowing Rock Road. In 1981, US 221 was placed on new construction between Baldwin and Jefferson, which was two-lane that can be expanded later into a divided four-lane; the old alignment, that went through downtown West Jefferson and Jefferson, became US 221 Business. In 1991, US 221 was placed on new bypass west of Marion; the old alignment became US 221 Business. The same year, US 221/NC 181 was placed on a new bypass west of Linville; the former alignment became a secondary road. In 1997, US 221/US 421 was placed on new construction between NC 194 to the South Fork New River, in Boone. In 2005, US 221/US 421 was placed on new four-lane expressway between the South Fork New River and Deep Gap; its old alignment, which partially paralleled the Blue Ridge Parkway, was downgraded to secondary roads. North Carolina Highway 19 North Carolina Highway 19 (NC 19) was an original state highway that traversed from the South Carolina state line, near Tryon, through Columbus, Rutherfordton, Marion and Spruce Pine, to Bakersville. In 1929, NC 19 was extended to the Tennessee state line, via Ramseytown, replacing part of NC 692. In 1934, NC 19 was decommissioned: South Carolina state line-Tryon to US 176, Tryon-Rutherfordton to NC 181, Rutherford-Woodlawn to US 221, Woodlawn-Ramseytown to NC 26 and Ramseytown- Tennessee state line to US 19W/US 23. North Carolina Highway 741 North Carolina Highway 741 (NC 741) existed twice in the state. Its first appeared by 1930 as a new primary routing between NC 151, north of Midland, through Mount Pleasant, to US 601/NC 80, in Gold Hill. In 1933, the highway south of Mount Pleasant was downgraded to secondary roads, while north was partially replaced by NC 62 and secondary roads. The second NC 741 was established in 1935 as a new primary routing between the South Carolina state line, through Harris, to US 74/US 221/NC 181, in Rutherfordton. In 1941, NC 741 was decommissioned and replaced mostly by US 221, with Jack McKinney Road, between the state line to Harris, as secondary road.

Route description Upon crossing the state line from Georgia, US 23/US 441 enter the Nantahala National Forest. The concurrent routes head north through a pair of small communities before intersecting US 64 in Franklin. US 23/US 441 turn east, briefly overlapping US 64 southeast of Franklin before separating from the route and continuing to the northeast through the Cowee Mountains. After passing Dillsboro, US 23/US 441 intersect US 74 (Great Smoky Mountains Expressway); US 23 splits east towards Waynesville, while US 441 joins US 74 westbound towards Bryson City. After traversing along the northern banks of the Tuckasegee River, US 441 splits from US 74 and continues north into the Qualla Boundary. In Cherokee, US 441 shares a short concurrency with US 19, then continues north along the west bank of the Oconaluftee River. After entering the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, US 441 connects to the southern terminus of the Blue Ridge Parkway. Known officially in the park as Newfound Gap Road, US 441 traverses northwesterly through park until it reaches Newfound Gap at the Tennessee state line. US 441 within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is maintained by the National Park Service and no commercial traffic is allowed. During the winter season, the road in the high elevation may be temporary closed due to inclement weather; signs after the park entrance and/or at the Oconaluftee Visitor Center will notify travelers/visitors on any closings or condition changes. US 441 also makes up part of Corridor A and Corridor K in the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). Corridor A connects Interstate 285 (I-285) in Sandy Springs, Georgia to I-40 near Clyde, North Carolina; it overlaps of US 441\\\\. Corridor K connects I-75 in Cleveland, Tennessee with US 23 in Dillsboro; it overlaps of US 441\\\\. ADHS provides additional funds, as authorized by the United States Congress, which have enabled US 441 to benefit from the successive improvements along its routing in both corridors. The white-on-blue banner \\"Appalachian Highway\\" is used to mark the ADHS corridor. History Established in 1951, US 441 was placed on existing highways through the region: a concurrency with US 23 from the Georgia state line through Franklin to Dillsboro; and a concurrency with NC 107 from Dillsboro through the Qualla Boundary and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to the Tennessee state line. In 1956, NC 107 was removed from the route. In 1970, the National Park Service requested, and subsequently approved, that US 441 shields be discontinued through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. In 1974, US 23/US 441 was placed on new bypass east of Franklin; its old alignment through Franklin became US 441 Business (US 441 Bus.). In Dillsboro, US 441 was placed on new alignment continuing north from Haywood Road onto new interchange with US 19A/US 23; its old alignment along Haywood Road was downgraded to secondary road. No major changes have been made since the mid-1970s, however modernizing improvements have been made including the construction of additional lanes and full interchanges at major intersections along its route.

The campaign is made to address the issue of gender discrimination around the world.\\"Discrimination against girls 'still deeply entrenched'\\", The Independent, 15 May 2007, p. 1 The goal of the campaign is to promote the rights of girls and bring millions of girls out of poverty around the world.Because I Am a Girl campaign at Plan International It is part of the organization's broader international development work. The campaign focuses on lack of equality faced by girls in developing countries and promotes projects to improve opportunities for girls in education, medical care, family planning, legal rights, and other areas. Campaign goals Plan International states that the campaign has several current goals, which in 2012 included: *Girls' education to be prioritised by world leaders *Girls' completion of a quality secondary education to be a major focus of international action *Funding for girls' education to be increased *An end to child marriage *An end to gender-based violence in and around schools Plan has targeted 4 million girls through direct programs and projects, and has the goal of reaching 40 million girls and boys indirectly through gender programs. Plan has a further goal of positively impacting 400 million girls through lobbying for governmental policy changes. Origins The campaign began shortly after Plan International published its first annual report on the state of the world's girls in May 2007, titled \\"Because I am a Girl\\". The widely cited report, principally written by Nikki Van der Gaag, compiled and analyzed research into the extent of discrimination against girls worldwide and in the developing world in particular. Violence against girls, forced child marriage, endemic poverty, and many other topics were examined. Plan International developed the Because I am a Girl campaign as an ongoing initiative to launch projects aimed at remedying the challenges faced by girls. Annual reports Each year, a Because I Am a Girl report is released by Plan as an update on the state of the world's girls. The report has been produced annually since 2007. Researchers for the report visit girls throughout the world and summarize their findings in the report. Reports released since 2007: * 2007: The State of World's Girls * 2008: In the Shadows of War * 2009: Girls in the Global Economy: Adding It All Up * 2010: Digital and Urban Frontiers * 2011: Because I am a Girl: So What About the Boys? * 2012: Because I am a Girl: Learning for Life * 2013: In Double Jeopardy: Adolescent Girls and Disasters * 2014: Pathways to Power: Creating Sustainable Change for Adolescent Girls * 2015: The Unfinished Business of Girls' Rights International activity Plan International has raised awareness of its campaign through innovative marketing, including a highly visible bus stop poster campaign. Plan International also initiated the International Day of the Girl Child, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly as an annual observance day. The inaugural International Day of the Girl Child was October 11, 2012. Plan International reached 1.1 million kids in the late '90s and as of 2018 it has reached greatly increased to 56.5 million children in more than 50 countries. Plan International's goal is to sponsor kids in impoverished countries so that they have a better chance in life. Plan International USA seeks to make sure that women and girls can manage their menstruation. There is a lot of stigma and one of the main goals is to provide more knowledge about menstruation to both females and males. Plan also works towards providing more access to sanitary products. #GirlsTakeover is a call for action on International Day of the Girl. In the U.S executive directors of UNICEF, UNWomen, and UNFPA were a part of the takeover and advocated for the equality of girls. More than a thousand takeovers were held in 60 different countries all over the world. Canada Plan Canada's Because I Am a Girl initiative created a petition to the Canadian government for a National Day of the Girl. This petition was designed to lobby the United Nations for an International Day of the Girl, initially to be observed on September 22.

Although designed as a ship of war, she spent most of her active career serving as a training ship (buque escuela). She represented Mexico at the quadricentennial celebrations of Columbus' first voyage, and circumnavigated the world in 1894‚Äì97. She saw action in various Mexican insurrections. She was decommissioned in 1926 and sunk. Construction Zaragoza was ordered by the Mexican government, and built in 1891 by the French Soci√©t√© Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la M√©diterran√©e shipyard at Le Havre. She was a steel-hulled vessel, with sails and a steam engine, armed with six Schneider-Canet cannon and two Hotchkiss guns. Service history Maiden voyage The corvette was commissioned in France by Commodore √Ångel Ortiz Monasterio, who sailed her across the Atlantic on her maiden voyage, arriving at Veracruz on 13February 1892. Columbian quadricentennial Under the command of Captain Reginald Carey Brenton, an officer of the British Royal Navy on a five-year assignment to the Mexican Navy as an instructor, she sailed back to Europe in October 1892. At the Spanish port of Palos de la Frontera, from where the Pinta, Ni√±a, and Santa Mar√≠a sailed in 1492, she attended the commemorations of the fourth centenary of the discovery of the Americas. Zaragoza acted as guard to the Spanish Royal Yacht and was visited by Queen Maria Christina of Austria. Global circumnavigation On returning to Mexico Zaragoza made two further voyages, to New Orleans and to France, before becoming the first Mexican Navy ship to circumnavigate the world. She sailed from Tampico on 5April 1894, still under Captain Brenton's command, south along the coast of South America and through the Strait of Magellan, and then back north to Acapulco. On 23April 1896, now again under the command of Commodore Ortiz, she sailed from Guaymas. After visiting San Francisco she sailed west across the Pacific, calling at Hawaii, Japan and Hong Kong, before stopping at Singapore, India and Egypt. She sailed through the Suez Canal entered the Mediterranean Sea, and headed for France. After minor repairs she crossed the Atlantic and arrived at Veracruz on 3July 1897. An account of the voyage was published by Zaragozas medical officer Dr. Carlos Glass. War in Yucat√°n Between 1898 and 1905 Zaragoza took part in operations against the Maya rebels of Yucat√°n, transporting troops, supplies, and ammunition to ports along the coast. In 1905 Zaragoza was part of the squadron that accompanied President Porfirio D√≠az in his visit to Yucat√°n. Mexican Revolution During the Mexican Revolution Zaragoza served under the constitutional government of President Francisco I. Madero and assisted in suppressing the revolt led by F√©lix D√≠az. In April 1914, Zaragoza was at Tampico when United States troops landed in nearby Veracruz, but took no offensive action. In August 1914, after the Constitutionalist revolution led by Venustiano Carranza, Zaragoza was sent to the port of Coatzacoalcos. From there, later in the year, she sailed to Yucat√°n to take part in the suppression of the rebellion led by Benjamin Argumedo. In 1923-24, Zaragoza took part in Adolfo de la Huerta's failed uprising against the government of √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n. Cortege In October 1919 she escorted the Uruguayan cruiser Uruguay, as she returned the remains of the poet Amado Nervo, who died while serving as Mexico's ambassador to Uruguay. Decommissioning After 34 years service, and in poor condition, the Zaragoza was finally decommissioned on 6March 1926 in a ceremony led by the Secretary of War Joaqu√≠n Amaro. The ship was subsequently stripped, and the hulk towed to sea to be sunk by gunfire.

The university fielded its first official varsity football team in the fall of 1906, and has fielded a team every season since then, with the exception of 1943 during World War II. The University of Florida did not adopt the \\"Florida Gators\\" nickname for its sports teams until 1911, and the early Florida football teams were known simply as \\"Florida\\" or the \\"Orange and Blue.\\" The football team played most of their home games at on-campus Fleming Field until 1930, when Florida Field was constructed. During the early 1900s, the Florida football team competed in the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS), but was not affiliated with an athletic conference. Later, Florida was a member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association and the Southern Conference, before joining with a dozen other schools to establish the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in 1932. Since 1992, the Gators have competed in the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS, formerly known as \\"Division I-A\\"), and the Eastern Division of the SEC.

The Key to Rondo The Key to Rondo is the first book of the Rondo trilogy.Author's website Plot After Leo's Great Aunt Bethany dies, Leo receives a family heirloom - an elaborate music box. There are four rules to the box: 1\\\\. Never wind the box while the music plays. 2\\\\. Never turn the key more than three times. 3\\\\. Never move the box while the music plays. 4\\\\. Never close the lid before the music has stopped. Leo, being the predictable, responsible boy he is, never even considers breaking the rules. And if he hadn't, perhaps for the rest of his life, the music box would have remained just that - a music box. He never expected his cousin Mimi Langlander to enter the equation. Mimi is sour, sarcastic and short-tempered; therefore it comes as no surprise to Leo that she is friendless. Even her own family can‚Äôt stand her. Things are exacerbated when Mimi, disregarding the rules, makes Leo turn the box five times. Out steps the evil Blue Queen, who introduces the kingdom of Rondo, the world inside the music box, to the Langlander cousins.The Key to Rondo at Goodreads The Blue Queen informs the cousins that for generations, Langlanders have traveled to Rondo using the Key of Rondo, which allows them entry to both worlds. The Blue Queen attempts to lure the Langlanders into Rondo, and when they refuse, she steals Mimi's dog Mutt back into Rondo, leaving the 'Key', a ring, behind. Heartbroken and distressed by the loss of her dog, Mimi takes the 'Key‚Äô and - despite Leo's warnings - enters Rondo. What Mimi doesn‚Äôt count on is Leo being dragged along into Rondo with her. As Mimi refuses to return to her world without Mutt, Leo reluctantly agrees to join Mimi in her quest to retrieve her dog. In the process, they expose several ancient secrets, defeat the Blue Queen, recover Mutt the dog, and discover the real Key; a pendant Mimi inherited from her Great Aunt Bethany.

Martin Murphy had brought his family to California with the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy Party in 1844. Martin Murphy purchased Rancho Ojo del Agua de la Coche to the north of Rancho San Francisco de las Llagas in 1846. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.

History Pipsqueak ZhuZhu Hamster ZhuZhu Pets were created by Russ Hornsby for his St. Louis company, Cepia LLC. The name comes from Mandarin zh≈´zh≈´ (), meaning \\"little pig.\\" In late 2009 Cepia employed only 16 people in the U.S. and 30 in China. The original ZhuZhu Pets are nine different characters, with names including Chunk, PipSqueak, Mr. Squiggles, and Num Nums. There are various accessories for creating customized hamster habitats. ZhuZhu Pets can be put in either of two play modes: \\"nurturing mode,\\" in which they coo and purr, or \\"adventure mode,\\" in which they explore their habitat and respond to various stimuli. ZhuZhu Pets were a craze during the 2009 holidays. They originally retailed for $9 USD, but for a time they sold for over $100 because of shortages. In December 2009, testing done by the consumer organisation GoodGuide was initially thought to have found more than the allowed level of the toxic, silvery metalloid antimony in the Mr. Squiggles toy. After a review, regulators from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said that the toy was within the \\"very protective\\" standard. GoodGuide subsequently issued an apology saying that their testing methods (which checked for surface toxins) were different from the federal standards (which check for soluble toxins.) Cepia encourages collecting of ZhuZhu Pets. Exclusive pets have been released in collaboration with Hallmark, Build-A-Bear Workshop, and Toys \\"R\\" Us. In early 2010 a set of new characters was released, including the Rockstar pets (Roxie, Ryder, Pax, and Kingston), inspired by the children of celebrities such as Angelina Jolie and Gwen Stefani. In mid-2010 the Kung Zhu line of battling hamsters was released, aimed at boys age 8‚Äì12. In December 2010 the ZhuZhu Princess series was released, as was a line of sixteen Burger King toys. Also released in 2010 were the first edition of ZhuZhu Babies, which are not electronic or plush, but plastic toys articulated with a small ball under their belly. The second 2011 edition of ZhuZhu Babies included motors. A clone of Zhu Zhu Pets emerged during 2010 called Furry Frenzies, which featured other animals. This inspired Zhu Zhu Pets to release non-hamster spinoff lines starting in 2011 when several dog breeds of Zhu Zhu Puppies were introduced. They are plush robotic puppies that move around and bark. In 2012, a safari line called Zhufari, a line of ponies called Zhu Zhu Ponies, and four Happy meal toys were released that were based on Quest for Zhu that were only sold in some countries excluding The U.S. The franchise was quietly discontinued sometime in 2013. Zhu Zhu Pets was rebooted when an animated series, now known as The ZhuZhus, debuted as \\"Polly and the ZhuZhu Pets\\" on September 12, 2016 on the Disney Channel in the United States. Starting February 2017, Spin Master showcased the ZhuZhu Pets franchise in a toy fair with new toy designs, based more on the TV series. Video games In 2010 the first ZhuZhu Pets video game was released for Nintendo DS, iPhone, and PC. The sequel, ZhuZhu Pets 2: Featuring The Wild Bunch, was also released for Nintendo DS and Wii, as well as ZhuZhu Pets: Kung Zhu for Nintendo DS. In 2011 ZhuZhu Princess: Carriages & Castles and ZhuZhu Puppies were released for Nintendo DS. Zhu Zhu Pets: Pets to the Rescue was planned for release on the Nintendo 3DS in 2013 but cancelled for unknown reasons. Film On September 27, 2011, the franchise's first full-length feature film Quest for Zhu was released straight-to-DVD.

Biblical sandals (, sandalim tanakhim), also called Tanakhi sandals and Khugistic sandals (, sandalim ·∏•ugistim), are sandals consisting of a sole with two leather ligaments that pass across the foot, and one around the heel. The leather is usually brown or black. The Biblical sandals are the classic model of leading sandals manufacturers in Israel. History The source of Biblical sandals is ancient. They appear in wall paintings found in archaeological digs dating the Old Testament in the Levant and were not very different from those used in Rome and Egypt. Reminders of such sandals were found at Masada and the Cave of Letters. In ancient times those sandals were made of non-processed leather and dry grass, and had strings or ropes made of simple, cheap materials. Though, sometimes golden or silver beads and even gems were added. In modern times, Biblical sandals are a symbol of Zionism. Israeli pioneer settlers and Israeli born Jews used them to show the return to the clothing worn by the ancestors and fit the climate. The harsh economic situation of the Zionists before the establishment of Israel, and of the Israelis in the 1940s to the 1960s, including the Austerity in Israel period, made those low-cost sandals a part of the proud-poor country-side or kibbutz fashion. The style contrasted with the more ostentatious attire of the city inhabitants who were European-influenced. Later, the city inhabitants started wearing these sandals too, especially after their popularization by Nimrod in Tel Aviv. Modern manufacturers known for making Biblical sandals include Nimrod, Shoresh, and Teva Naot. The sandals are also sometimes worn by members of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, while the Knesset is in session. An exhibit on Biblical sandals and Israeli culture was opened at the Eretz Israel Museum in July 2018.

West Coast Entertainment Corporation, 174 F.3d 1036 (9th Cir. 1999), heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, established that trademark infringement could occur through the use of trademarked terms in the HTML metatags of web pages when initial interest confusion was likely to result. Background In 1993 Brookfield Communications started selling software that provided customers with a searchable database of entertainment-related information such as listings of actors, directors, upcoming movies, and other related news. The software was sold under the mark \\"MovieBuff\\". In 1996 Brookfield began selling their MovieBuff product and providing online access to their searchable database from their website. The domain moviebuff.com had already been registered to West Coast Entertainment so Brookfield registered and used other domains. In 1997 Brookfield applied for federal registration of \\"MovieBuff\\" as both a good and a service trademark. It received the registrations in 1998. In 1998 Brookfield learned that West Coast intended to launch a website at moviebuff.com which would contain, among other things, a searchable database of entertainment-related news. Brookfield issued a cease-and-desist letter to West Coast stating the website would infringe on Brookfield's trademark, MovieBuff. West Coast went ahead with their website plans; Brookfield subsequently filed a complaint alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition in violation of the Lanham Act. Procedural history In November 1998 Brookfield filed a complaint against West Coast with the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition under sections 32 and 43(a) of the Lanham Act, ,. Brookfield then applied for a temporary restraining order that would prevent West Coast from using \\"MovieBuff\\" or \\"moviebuff.com\\" as its domain name, the name of its online service or in any \\"buried code or metatags\\" on their web site. The district court denied the motion for a temporary restraining order whereupon Brookfield filed for an appeal as well as an injunction against West Coast pending the appeal; the district court again denied the injunction. Finally, Brookfield filed an emergency motion for injunction pending appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which was granted. The Ninth Circuit then heard the appeal from the original denial of a temporary restraining order. Complaint In their complaint, Brookfield alleged that West Coast's plan to offer an online searchable database of entertainment-related news at the site moviebuff.com would constitute trademark infringement and unfair competition under sections 32 and 43(a) of the Lanham Act, , , infringing on Brookfield's trademark \\"MovieBuff\\". Opposition brief Soon after Brookfield filed their complaint, West Coast filed an opposition brief in which they argued for their right to use moviebuff.com as planned. West Coast gave two reasons: 1) West Coast was the senior user of the mark; and 2) their intended use of moviebuff.com would not cause a likelihood of confusion so there could be no violation under the Lanham Act. West Coast put forth two arguments to support its claim as the senior user of the mark: 1) West Coast had used \\"The Movie Buff's Movie Store\\" in promotions and advertising since 1986 and it had a federally registered trademark on that logo; or 2) West Coast had established its right to the mark by using \\"moviebuff.com\\" before Brookfield began offering its online searchable database service. Court's finding In considering whether to grant the preliminary injunction against West Coast, the Court of Appeals considered separately West Coast's use of the domain name moviebuff.com, and West Coast's use of any \\"buried code or metatags\\" containing \\"MovieBuff\\" or any terms likely to cause confusion with Brookfield's trademark. Use of domain name Brookfield had to first establish that it had a valid protectable trademark in \\"MovieBuff\\". The court found that it did, rejecting West Coast's contention that their use of \\"The Movie Buff's Movie Store\\" since 1986 established their prior use. The court based its finding on the fact that West Coast's trademark was not \\"essentially the same\\" as \\"MovieBuff\\". The court also rejected West Coast's second argument, that it was the senior user of moviebuff.com because it started using that domain name when it registered it in February 1996 while Brookfield only started offering the searchable database online under the name MovieBuff in August 1997. The court found that West Coast's use of moviebuff.com did not begin until it publicly announced its launch of that website in 1998 and so Brookfield's use of \\"MovieBuff\\" in connection with its online searchable database predates West Coast's use of moviebuff.com and therefore Brookfield is the senior user. Once the court established that Brookfield was the senior user of its mark, it then looked to whether there was a likelihood of confusion that would cause consumers to attribute West Coast's site at moviebuff.com to Brookfield. The court considered the eight factors known commonly as the Sleekcraft factors in determining whether there was a likelihood of confusion: \\"similarity of the conflicting designations; relatedness or proximity of the two companies' products or services; strength of Brookfield's mark; marketing channels used; degree of care likely to be exercised by purchasers in selecting goods; West Coast's intent in selecting its mark; evidence of actual confusion; and likelihood of expansion in product lines.\\" After weighing each of these factors, the court found that a likelihood of confusion did exist and that Brookfield did establish a \\"likelihood of success on its claim that West Coast's use of moviebuff.com violates the Lanham Act\\" and so a preliminary injunction against West Coast use of that domain name was warranted. Use of metatags The court considered separately the question of whether West Coast could use \\"MovieBuff\\" in any of its HTML code. The court found that while doing so might cause a search engine to include West Coast's site in the results returned for the search term \\"MovieBuff\\", it is unlikely to cause confusion as the searcher will see West Coast's site listed by the domain name (e.g., westcoastvideo.com) and will not be confused as to the source of that site. However, the court found that such use of the mark could result in initial interest confusion. To explain initial interest confusion, the court gave as an analogy the case where one of West Coast's competitors, e.g., Blockbuster, posts a sign on the highway proclaiming \\"West Coast Video, exit 7\\" when in fact West Coast Video is at exit 8 and Blockbuster Video is at exit 7. The court explained how customers who take exit 7 looking for West Coast Video are likely to end up renting from Blockbuster once they realize they can not find West Coast Video and they see that Blockbuster is right there. Even customers who would prefer West Coast Video to Blockbuster might decide it is not worth the trouble to get back on the highway to continue searching for a West Coast Video. Although those customers have no confusion, they know they are renting from Blockbuster, Blockbuster has created initial interest confusion and is profiting unfairly from the good will established by the West Coast Video mark. The court explained that the false road sign posted by Blockbuster to attract West Coast Video customers is analogous to West Coast's inclusion of \\"MovieBuff\\" in its HTML code. West Coast argued that its use of \\"MovieBuff\\" in its metatags was an appropriate descriptive term and so was a fair use. The court found however, that while the use of the descriptive term \\"Movie Buff\\" was perfectly legal, the use of \\"MovieBuff\\" was not. The former is a descriptive term associated with the West Coast products, the latter is not even a word in the English language. The court found a likelihood of Brookfield succeeding on its claim of trademark infringement and so reversed the district court's decision and remanded back to the district court for a granting of the preliminary injunction. Subsequent criticism Judge Berzon of the Ninth Circuit, in a concurring opinion in Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corp., asked whether the court wanted to ‚Äúto continue to apply an insupportable rule‚Äù, referring to Initial Interest Confusion as discussed in Brookfield.

The band is composed of primary songwriter/ guitarist Matt Ragland, singer Reid Umstattd, keyboardist/saxophonist Brian Donohoe, guitarist Matt Muehling, and drummer David Sierra. History Nelo was officially formed in 2005, but Ragland, Hill, Long, and Goodson started playing casually together years before in Dallas, Texas, where they attended the same high school. During these years, Ragland began writing songs and found an unsuspected singer in Umstattd, a long time friend at a summer camp in Burnet, Texas. Ragland and Umstattd became college roommates and started playing around Austin as an acoustic duo. After graduating college, Ragland brought the entire group together, with the addition of Mike St. Clair on bass. Upon the formation of the band in September 2005, Nelo immediately moved to Athens, Georgia and began playing at DT's Down Under, an underground bar that Ragland would later manage. The band moved on to regularly play other local venues including the 40 Watt Club and the Georgia Theatre. In the spring of 2007, the group moved back to Texas to begin work on what would become their self-titled debut album in Austin. Recorded at Willie Nelson‚Äôs Pedernales Studios and released on Justice Records, Nelo was composed of songs written largely by Ragland and road tested over the previous years in Texas, Athens and across the Southeast. In April 2008 the record debuted at No. 21 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers Chart. The band spent the year touring to support the album. The band returned to Pedernales Studios in December 2008 to record Two Years Ago, an EP. produced by Doug Lancio. The band and original member David Long parted ways at the end of 2008. Nelo began touring in January 2009 in support of Two Years Ago, which was released by Justice Records one song at a time on iTunes beginning in March and ending as a completed E.P. on July 14. The E.P. was made available exclusively online and at live shows. In March 2009, Nelo played the SXSW Music Conference in Austin for the second time and added saxophonist Brian Donohoe to the band. Nelo performed at Austin City Limits Music Festival on October 2, 2009. Soon after, the band and former members Chris Hill, Mike St.Clair and Stephen Goodson went their separate ways. The band released their second record, \\"Ordinary Scene\\", in October 2010 and supported it with shows across Texas and the southeast. \\"Ordinary Scene\\" was produced by Matt Ragland and mixed by C.J. Eiriksson (U2, Steve Lillywhite). \\"Ordinary Scene\\" debuted at No. 6 on the iTunes Rock Charts. In March 2011, Nelo again played the SXSW music festival at Lustre Pearl in Austin. In late 2011, Nelo recorded an impromptu live session at Willie Nelson's Pedernales Studio just outside Austin. The band filmed the project and released the videos in anticipation of \\"Old Friends... (Live at Pedernales Studio\\", released on February 28, 2012. In the spring of 2012, Nelo started work on a new record with all new songs written by Ragland over the previous year. Working with multiple mixing engineers on the project caused the release date to be pushed back numerous times. In the end Ragland co-mixed the album himself. On February 4, 2014 the new self-titled album debuted at No. 18 on the iTunes Rock Charts. In mid 2017, Nelo released their first live acoustic album entitled \\"Roots (Live)\\", featuring two recorded shows performed by Matt and Reid as a duo. The first night was taped at the Listening Room in Austin, TX and the second night was taped as part of a songwriter's showcase in a church on campus at the University of Texas.

He was known as Hon. Henry Seymour-Conway until 1793, when his father was created a marquess; he then became Lord Henry Seymour-Conway, but dropped the surname of Conway after his father's death in 1794. Norris Castle Seymour-Conway was educated at Eton and Hertford College, Oxford, and took his MA from Merton College in 1767. He was first elected to the House of Commons in 1766 as Member for Coventry. He generally, though not always, voted with his uncle and namesake Henry Seymour Conway. After the 1768 election, when he and Andrew Archer defeated a challenge by Walter Waring, he was a consistent supporter of the Grafton and then the North governments. Due to a falling-out between his father, the Earl of Hertford, and the Corporation of Coventry, Seymour-Conway did not stand as a candidate there at the 1774 election. He was instead returned by the North administration at Midhurst, which was a Treasury borough that year. In 1776, he was also returned to the Parliament of Ireland for Antrim County, which he represented until 1783. As his re-election in Midhurst did not appear to be sustainable in the 1780 election, he stood successfully at Downton. In the 1784 election, Seymour-Conway and Robert Shafto faced off against Hon. Edward Bouverie and William Scott, and, a double return being made, the case came before the House of Commons. Seymour-Conway chose not to stand in the ensuing by-election; his brother William took his place and won the by-election. During this period, he was for some time a captain in the Warwickshire Militia, and befriended the poet George Crabbe while quartered at Aldeburgh. On 11 February 1793, he was promoted major. The election of 1784 marked Henry's retirement from politics. In 1790, he and his brother Robert were jointly granted, for life, the sinecures of joint prothonotary, clerk of the crown, filazer, and keeper of the declarations of the King's Bench in Ireland. By 1816, these offices brought an income of more than ¬£10,000 a year (equivalent to ¬£ as of ) . He was also craner and wharfinger of the Port of Dublin, a sinecure abolished in 1830. He spent the rest of his life in the improvement of his estate at Norris Castle, in the Isle of Wight, where he experimented with the use of seaweed as a fertiliser. He had a reputation for both eccentricity and benevolence when he died, unmarried, in 1830. There is a memorial to him in St. Mildred's Church, Whippingham. He left Norris Castle to his youngest brother Lord George Seymour, who sold it to newspaperman Robert Bell in 1839.

She was the daughter of Cunimund, king of the Gepids, and wife of Alboin, king of the Lombards. Life Rosamund was born into a kingdom in crisis, as the Gepid people had been fighting a losing battle against the Lombards since 546, firstly within the context of a Lombardic-East Roman alliance, and later against the Lombards and the Avar nomads. These wars had taken the lives of not only her grandfather king Thurisind, but also her uncle, Thurismund, both of which served to establish a long-standing hatred of the Lombards in her father, Cunimund, which he passed down to her. This hatred was what spawned the final war of the Gepids, as Cunimund attempted to win back lost lands against the Lombards. The war, however, quickly turned, and in 567, the Gepid Kingdom would be completely subdued by a mixture of Lombard and Avar forces, her father was decapitated and she, along with many other Gepids, was taken as a prisoner of the Lombards (see Lombard‚ÄìGepid War (567)). However, in an attempt to secure a male heir and following the death of his first wife Clotsuinda of Frankia, Alboin took her as his wife. Alboin was noted for his cruelty towards her; his most famous act of cruelty was reported by Paulus Diaconus, who states that at a royal banquet in Verona, Alboin forced her to drink from the skull of her dead father (which he carried around his belt), inviting her \\"to drink merrily with her father\\".Diaconus, Paulus, Foulke, William Dudley (2004), Historia gentis Langobardorum, Adamant Media Corporation, Boston, p. 81 Rosamund forced to drink from the skull of her father by Pietro della Vecchia After this, she began plotting to have her husband assassinated. Thus, Rosamund met with the king's arms bearer and her lover, Helmichis, who suggested using Peredeo, \\"a very strong man\\", to accomplish the assassination. Peredeo refused to help, and that night mistakenly had intercourse with Rosamund, who was disguised as a servant. After learning that he had committed adultery with his king's wife, Peredeo agreed to take part in an assassination attempt in fear of the king's retribution. After the great feast, Alboin went to bed inebriated, at which point Rosamund ordered the king's sword bound to his bedpost, so that should he wake in the middle of the assassination attempt, he would be defenseless. Alboin did wake, only to find himself unarmed. He fended off his attackers temporarily with a footstool, but was killed. Due in part to the work of Paulus Diaconus, there seems to be some confusion about who actually killed Alboin, with both Helmichis and Peredeo assigned as sole murderer.Hodgkin, Thomas (1895), Italy and Her Invaders, volume V, Oxford-Clarendon Press, Clarendon, p. 170 Immediately afterwards, Helmichis planned to marry Rosamund and usurp the throne by claiming kingship. However, this plan gained little support from the various duchies of the Lombard kingdom, so Rosamund, Helmichis, and Albsuinda, Alboin's daughter by his first wife, fled together to the East Roman stronghold of Ravenna with a large proportion of Alboin's private treasures. Rosamund and Helmichis married in Ravenna, but were soon divided when Rosamund, in an attempt to curry favour, took as a lover Longinus, the exarch, who had helped them plan the murder of Alboin.Herwig, Wolfram (1997), The Roman Empire and its Germanic Peoples, University of California Press, California, p. 291 At the urging of Longinus, who promised to marry her, she attempted to murder her former lover Helmichis by poisoning, handing him the drink after he had washed; however, she was instead murdered by Helmichis, who forced her to drink the poison before committing suicide by the same means. Rosamund in later culture :See also Alboin ¬ß Cultural references Rosamund would inspire many later tragedies, based on her life, particularly in Italy, where the folk song \\"Donna Lumbarda\\" was passed down orally through the generations, inspiring later renditions of the tale. Medieval folk tales and legends developed.Guerber, Helene Adeline (1896), Myths and Legends Series: Middle Ages, George C. Harrap & Co., pp. 102-105 The first true tragedy, Giovanni Rucellai's Rosmunda, was first performed in 1525 and would serve as the basis for many later tellings of the story in the Italian language, such as Vittorio Alfieri's 1783 work of the same name and a Sam Benelli play of 1911. The conspiracy to murder Alboin also inspired the 1961/2 film Rosmunda e Alboino, aka Sword of the Conqueror etc., by Carlo Campogalliani. In 1665 Urban Hj√§rne wrote a comedy in Swedish on the same matter, Rosimunda. It is the first original play in that language known to have actually been staged, as entertainment for the young Charles XI while he studied at Uppsala university. In the English language, the story would also be considered a tragedy, albeit more often neglected than in the Italian tradition, but it was the subject of Robert Burton Rodney's mid 19th C. poem Alboin and Rosamond, and would be treated by the pre-Raphaelite poet Algernon Charles Swinburne in his 1899 work Rosamund, Queen of the Lombards. In Meg Cabot's young adult novel series The Princess Diaries published from 2000 on, Rosimunda is renamed 'Rosagunde'. While the story of her marriage to Alboin is the same, in Cabot's re-telling she is granted Genovia by the king of Italy as a reward for killing Alboin, making her the first princess of Genovia and an ancestor to the series' protagonist Mia Thermopolis.

Nash played as a slow left-arm orthodox bowler for Lancashire, and later in Minor Counties cricket for his native Buckinghamshire. Life and career Nash began playing cricket at club level for Oving. At the club he started as an underarm bowler, but as was common at the time, he developed to the newer overarm style of bowling. He played cricket as a professional, moving around clubs, and playing for a time for Lancashire in first-class cricket. During his first-class career, he claimed 232 wickets at an average of 12.36. He took eight wickets in an innings on three occasions; against Surrey and the United South of England Eleven in 1880, and against Somerset in 1882. Along with many other spin bowlers of his time, his bowling action was questioned, and he eventually left first-class cricket as a result: his final match for Lancashire was in 1885, though he played rarely after 1883. He returned to club cricket, and played for Darlington for ten years, and was awarded a benefit match upon his departure. He played out his career at Buckinghamshire, playing Minor Counties cricket, until his death in 1903. He was twice selected to play in representative sides: in 1880 for the North against the United South of England Eleven, and in 1883 for \\"The Rest\\" against Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. Very much a bowler, Nash's highest score batting in first-class cricket was 30. Bill Roe said that in a game against Cambridge University, Nash was dropped off every ball of an over bowled by Robert Ramsay, before Roe himself caught the professional off the first ball of the following over.

The battle, fought between Otavi mountain and Otavifontein, was a delaying action led by the German Major Hermann Ritter. Ritter's forces intended to buy the main German force at Tsombe several days so as they could harden their positions there. In the end, Botha's forces were able to rout Ritter's troops, leading to an overall breakdown in the German lines that brought the campaign to an end. Background By mid 1915 the South African advance in German Southwest Africa had gained considerable ground and efforts at negotiating a ceasefire had failed. Rather than seek a decisive battle, the German commander Victor Franke had decided to resort to keeping his army as intact as possible so as to maintain a German claim to the territory after the end of the war. Rather than resort to guerrilla warfare or attempt to break out of German Southwest Africa, Franke decided to retreat along the railway and build up defenses around Tsombe.Keith, 116. With the South African army under Louis Botha rapidly approaching, Franke decided to leave a delaying force under his second in command Major Hermann Ritter at Otavifontein. The delaying force was tasked with holding up Botha for as long as possible so that the main force at Tsombe could concentrate its forces and solidify its defenses there.Strachan, 266. Botha began his advance on June 18, learning from intercepted communications that the Germans were retreating up the railway but would not retreat farther than Namutoni. Botha split his 13,000 troops into four columns with one on each flank and two under his personal command driving up along the railway.Keith, 116. With a swift advance, the South Africans began to surround the German positions and Botha's central columns managed to reach Otavi by July 1. The Germans thought that Botha's advance would be hampered by a lack of water and rough terrain, and were ill-prepared for the looming South African attack. At his disposal Botha had 3,500 cavalry compared to Ritter's 1,000 infantry and ten machine guns. Although heavily outnumbered, Ritter's forces did have the advantage of the high ground, as the territory they defended was quite mountainous. Despite this advantage, Ritter feared that his force would become surrounded and spread his forces out to lengthen his line of defense.Strachan, 267. Battle Because Ritter's line of defense was so long, his flanks were unable to support each other. That, combined with his lack of forces to man such a wide perimeter adequately, caused his left flank to falter when the South African forces advanced upon it. Fearful his lines would break, Ritter pulled back to the hills of Otavifontein and to Otavi mountain. Despite the fact that these new positions held the high ground, the Germans had not prepared any fortifications there. With no artillery and no solid defensive positions, the German force easily broke into a general retreat when pressed by Botha's troops. By 1pm the battle had ended, with Ritter pulling back to positions near Gaub and leaving Botha with a clear path to the main German body at Tsombe.Strachan, 267. Eugen Mansfeld, who was present at the battle as a Reserve Leutnant in the German forces, laid the blame for German defeat squarely on Franke. Mansfeld stated that Major Ritter had occupied an excellent defensive position at Otavifontein, but that on the morning of 28 June 1915 Franke arrived with his staff officer and ordered a redisposition of Ritter's forces south of the original position, separating Ritter's three artillery batteries and leaving the companies of troops widely dispersed in no logical order. Mansfeld suggested that if the Germans had kept to Ritter's original plan, the South African forces‚Äîwho were unable to transport water by railway‚Äîwould have been forced to retreat to the nearest water station, with severe losses to their horses as a result.Mansfeld, 138-9. Aftermath Botha's victory was swift, with the South African advance being delayed only a day and suffering only four dead and seven wounded. The Germans had fled without putting up any committed defense, and Ritter's force fled largely intact with only three dead, eight wounded, and twenty captured.Wittal, 147. Although a delay of just two days by Ritter would have sufficed, Ritter's early withdrawal allowed Franke's unprepared forces to become nearly encircled. The German forces retreated to the farm of Khorab, where on 5 July 1915 they set up a defensive position around the farmhouse and reservoir.Mansfeld, 141. With no means of escaping further up the rail line and a general lack of will to pursue any other course of action, Franke had little choice but to surrender his forces to Botha on 9 July 1915, effectively ending all major German resistance in Southwest-Africa.Strachan, 167.

Moy was born in a small town outside of Canton, China; he emigrated to the United States at the age of 10 in 1931, and joined other members of his family who had settled in St. Paul, Minnesota. During this time, Moy attended school during the day, and trained in his uncle's restaurant as an assistant chef when not in school. In 1934, Moy was introduced to art classes at the WPA Federal Art Project School through a friend. For the next few years, Moy studied art first at the Federal Art Project, and later at the St. Paul School of Art under Cameron Booth, and the WPA Graphic Workshop at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, MN. Advisors recognized his talent and permitted him to take more classes while maintaining a job. In 1941 he moved to New York City where he was awarded a scholarship to study at the Art Students League of New York and the Hoffman School of Art. This lasted until the fall of 1942, when he enlisted with the United States Army Air Forces, serving in the China-India-Burma Theater as an aerial reconnaissance photographer with the 14th Air Force, the \\"Flying Tigers\\". After the war Moy married and brought his wife Sui Yung to New York. He returned to the Art Students League on the G.I. Bill and re-established his relationship with Cameron Booth, who was now teaching in New York. Moy experimented with printmaking at the Atelier 17 in New York. In the 1950s, Moy became a professor, teaching almost forty years at colleges, universities, and institutions: * Cooper Union * Pratt Graphic Arts Center * Columbia University * New York University * Smith College * Vassar College * Provincetown, Massachusetts In 1955 Moy won a Guggenheim Fellowship. His woodcuts from this time are notable in their use of subject matter from Chinese classics, combined with the formal techniques of Abstract Expressionism. For example, his woodcut Inscription of T'Chao Pae #II (1952) explores the potential of archaic Chinese calligraphy, illustrating the artist's aim, in his own words, to \\"recreate in the abstract idiom of contemporary time some of the ideas of ancient Chinese art forms.\\"Mayching Kao, \\"Chinese Artists in the United States\\", in Gordon Chang, ed.Asian American Art: A History, 1850-1950, pp.204‚Äì205. He returned to China at the age of 85, in 2008, with his wife, daughters and grandchildren to the rural villages where he and his wife were born in the 1920s. He had a great effect on his family and many who knew him in his life. Moy died in New York on June 9, 2013. He was survived by his wife of sixty six years, Sui Yung, his daughters, Jacqueline and Adrienne, and two grandchildren, Eamon and Fiona. His work can be found in the permanent collections of a number of museums in the United States, including the Brooklyn Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum.  Fellowships  In 1941: Moy attended to the Art Students League in New York by earning a scholarship. He studied painting and printmaking under Vaclav Vytlacil and Will Barnet. He also won another scholarship to the Hans Hofmann School of Art. In 1948: He was awarded a fellowship to study printmaking at Stanley William Hayter's legendary Atelier 17 graphic arts studio which is in New York. Although it was the ideal environment for Moy, he needed a studio for printmaking. Moy described Atelier 17 as > ‚Äúan exchange of points of view, exchange of ideas, what one is trying to do > and searching for some newness in technical innovations to fit in with a > situation.‚Äù In 1950: Moy received a Whitney Fellowship, the biggest award of his career. Consequently, he was suggested to visit artist position at the University of Minnesota, which is the place that he began to teach. Moy went on to teach at the University of Indiana, Smith, Vassar, and Columbia. In 1955: Moy won a Guggenheim Fellowship. His woodcuts from this time are notable in their use of subject matter from Chinese classics, combined with the formal techniques of Abstract Expressionism.

BOMs (byte order marks) can also be omitted, if desired, from file writing. Codepages installed on the user's system can be used for reading or writing files; text can also be re-coded into other codepages. AkelPad implements an auto-detection algorithm for detection of some common codepages used (optional). AkelPad can also detect non-text (i.e. binary) files and will issue a message. Binary files can, however, be loaded and edited (e.g. internal text) if desired. Plugins The program's architecture is structured to allow external plugins (DLLs) for extension of AkelPad's capabilities. At present, 31 plugins are implemented and available on AkelPad's homepage. Some of the more noteworthy plugins are: *Coder - code folding support, autocomplete support, syntax highlighting and color themes. *ContextMenu - user can customize main menu, some context menus. *ToolBar - implements one or more user configurable toolbars. ToolBar buttons can access external programs, if desired. *Explorer - embeds Windows Explorer into a separate pane in the user interface. *Scripts - scripts can access more than 40 internal AkelPad routines (for example, Zen Coding) and can, of course, be user written. *Hotkeys - user can assign functions to specific keys or key combinations. Functions may be internal to AkelPad, external (i.e. run external applications) or plugin related. *SpecialChar - toggles (on/off) display of normally invisible special characters, i.e. space, tabs, newline, vertical tabulation, formfeeds and null characters.

With nearly 30 plugins available (to date), keeping plugins current may be a chore. The program's author has created an update utility - AkelUpdater  to make this task easy. AkelUpdater * queries an online file (i.e. database) to determine the most current versions of the plugin DLLs and AkelPad executable * queries the user's AkelPad configuration, i.e. which plugins are in use, available and their versions then provides a list of possible updates. The user can adjust this list as necessary, choosing to not update plugins, or to update plugins not currently in use. The utility then * downloads the file PlugsPack.zip, an up-to-date collection of all available plugins, from the plugins download site, and * installs the necessary updates, as selected.

Retrieved 22 May 2016. It is to be distinguished from paranormal magic which are effects claimed to be created through supernatural means. It is one of the oldest performing arts in the world. Modern entertainment magic, as pioneered by 19th-century magician Jean Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin, has become a popular theatrical art form. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, magicians such as Maskelyne and Devant, Howard Thurston, Harry Kellar, and Harry Houdini achieved widespread commercial success during what has become known as \\"the Golden Age of Magic\\". During this period, performance magic became a staple of Broadway theatre, vaudeville, and music halls. Magic retained its popularity in the television age, with magicians such as Paul Daniels, David Copperfield, Doug Henning, Penn & Teller, David Blaine, and Derren Brown modernizing the art form. History The term \\"magic\\" etymologically derives from the Greek word mageia (ŒºŒ±Œ≥ŒµŒØŒ±). In ancient times, Greeks and Persians had been at war for centuries, and the Persian priests, called magosh in Persian, came to be known as magoi in Greek. Ritual acts of Persian priests came to be known as mageia, and then magika ‚Äî which eventually came to mean any foreign, unorthodox, or illegitimate ritual practice. To the general public, successful acts of illusion could be perceived as if it were similar to a feat of magic supposed to have been able to be performed by the ancient magoi. The performance of tricks of illusion, or magical illusion, and the apparent workings and effects of such acts have often been referred to as \\"magic\\" and particularly as magic tricks. The earliest known book to explain magic secrets, The Discoverie of Witchcraft, was published in 1584. It was created by Reginald Scot to stop people from being killed for witchcraft. During the 17th century, many books were published that described magic tricks. Until the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at fairs. A founding figure of modern entertainment magic was Jean Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin, who had a magic theatre in Paris in 1845. John Henry Anderson was pioneering the same transition in London in the 1840s. Towards the end of the 19th century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm. As a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television magic specials. Performances that modern observers would recognize as conjuring have been practiced throughout history. For example, a trick with three cups and balls has been performed since 3 B.C. and is still performed today on stage and in street magic shows. For many recorded centuries, magicians were associated with the devil and the occult. During the 19th and 20th centuries, many stage magicians even capitalized on this notion in their advertisements. The same level of ingenuity that was used to produce famous ancient deceptions such as the Trojan Horse would also have been used for entertainment, or at least for cheating in money games. They were also used by the practitioners of various religions and cults from ancient times onwards to frighten uneducated people into obedience or turn them into adherents. However, the profession of the illusionist gained strength only in the 18th century, and has enjoyed several popular vogues since. Magic tricks Opinions vary among magicians on how to categorize a given effect, but a number of categories have been developed. Magicians may pull a rabbit from an empty hat, make something seem to disappear, or transform a red silk handkerchief into a green silk handkerchief. Magicians may also destroy something, like cutting a head off, and then \\"restore\\" it, make something appear to move from one place to another, or they may escape from a restraining device. Other illusions include making something appear to defy gravity, making a solid object appear to pass through another object, or appearing to predict the choice of a spectator. Many magic routines use combinations of effects. An illustration from Reginald Scot's The Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584), one of the earliest books on magic tricks, explaining how the \\"Decollation of John Baptist\\" decapitation illusion may be performed One of the earliest books on the subject is Gantziony's work of 1489, Natural and Unnatural Magic, which describes and explains old-time tricks. In 1584, Englishman Reginald Scot published The Discoverie of Witchcraft, part of which was devoted to debunking the claims that magicians used supernatural methods, and showing how their \\"magic tricks\\" were in reality accomplished. Among the tricks discussed were sleight-of-hand manipulations with rope, paper and coins. At the time, fear and belief in witchcraft was widespread and the book tried to demonstrate that these fears were misplaced. Popular belief held that all obtainable copies were burned on the accession of James I in 1603. During the 17th century, many similar books were published that described in detail the methods of a number of magic tricks, including The Art of Conjuring (1614) and The Anatomy of Legerdemain: The Art of Juggling (c. 1675). Advertisement for Isaac Fawkes' show from 1724 in which he boasts of the success of his performances for the King and Prince George Until the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at fairs, where itinerant performers would entertain the public with magic tricks, as well as the more traditional spectacles of sword swallowing, juggling and fire breathing. In the early 18th century, as belief in witchcraft was waning, the art became increasingly respectable and shows would be put on for rich private patrons. A notable figure in this transition was the English showman, Isaac Fawkes, who began to promote his act in advertisements from the 1720s‚Äîhe even claimed to have performed for King George II. One of Fawkes' advertisements described his routine in some detail: From 1756 to 1781, Jacob Philadelphia performed feats of magic, sometimes under the guise of scientific exhibitions, throughout Europe and in Russia. Modern stage magic Jean Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin, pioneer of modern magic entertainment A founding figure of modern entertainment magic was Jean Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin, originally a clockmaker, who opened a magic theatre in Paris in 1845. He transformed his art from one performed at fairs to a performance that the public paid to see at the theatre. His speciality was constructing mechanical automata that appeared to move and act as if alive. Many of Robert-Houdin's mechanisms for illusion were pirated by his assistant and ended up in the performances of his rivals, John Henry Anderson and Alexander Herrmann. John Henry Anderson was pioneering the same transition in London. In 1840 he opened the New Strand Theatre, where he performed as The Great Wizard of the North. His success came from advertising his shows and captivating his audience with expert showmanship. He became one of the earliest magicians to attain a high level of world renown. He opened a second theatre in Glasgow in 1845. John Nevil Maskelyne, a famous magician and illusionist of the late 19th century. Towards the end of the century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm. The British performer J N Maskelyne and his partner Cooke were established at the Egyptian Hall in London's Piccadilly in 1873 by their manager William Morton, and continued there for 31 years. The show incorporated stage illusions and reinvented traditional tricks with exotic (often Oriental) imagery. The potential of the stage was exploited for hidden mechanisms and assistants, and the control it offers over the audience's point of view. Maskelyne and Cooke invented many of the illusions still performed today‚Äîone of his best-known being levitation. The model for the look of a 'typical' magician‚Äîa man with wavy hair, a top hat, a goatee, and a tailcoat‚Äîwas Alexander Herrmann (1844‚Äì1896), also known as Herrmann the Great. Herrmann was a French magician and was part of the Herrmann family name that is the \\"first-family of magic\\". The escapologist and magician Harry Houdini (1874-1926) took his stage name from Robert-Houdin and developed a range of stage magic tricks, many of them based on what became known after his death as escapology. Houdini was genuinely skilled in techniques such as lockpicking and escaping straitjackets, but also made full use of the range of conjuring techniques, including fake equipment and collusion with individuals in the audience. Houdini's show-business savvy was as great as his performance skill. There is a Houdini Museum dedicated to him in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The Magic Circle was formed in London in 1905 to promote and advance the art of stage magic. As a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television specials, which opened up new opportunities for deceptions, and brought stage magic to huge audiences. Famous magicians of the 20th century included Okito, David Devant, Harry Blackstone Sr., Harry Blackstone Jr., Howard Thurston, Theodore Annemann, Cardini, Joseph Dunninger, Dai Vernon, Fred Culpitt, Tommy Wonder, Siegfried & Roy, and Doug Henning. Popular 20th- and 21st-century magicians include David Copperfield, Lance Burton, James Randi, Penn and Teller, David Blaine, Criss Angel, Hans Klok, Derren Brown and Dynamo. Well-known women magicians include Dell O'Dell and Dorothy Dietrich. Most television magicians perform before a live audience, who provide the remote viewer with a reassurance that the illusions are not obtained with post-production visual effects. Many of the principles of stage magic are old. There is an expression, \\"it's all done with smoke and mirrors\\", used to explain something baffling, but effects seldom use mirrors today, due to the amount of installation work and transport difficulties. For example, the famous Pepper's Ghost, a stage illusion first used in 19th-century London, required a specially built theatre. Modern performers have vanished objects as large as the Taj Mahal, the Statue of Liberty, and a space shuttle, using other kinds of optical deceptions. Types of magic performance Magic is often described according to various specialties or genres. A mentalist on stage in a mind-reading performance, 1900 Amateur magician performing \\"children's magic\\" for a birthday party audience Stage illusions Stage illusions are performed for large audiences, typically within a theatre or auditorium. This type of magic is distinguished by large-scale props, the use of assistants and often exotic animals such as elephants and tigers. Famous stage illusionists, past and present, include Harry Blackstone, Sr., Howard Thurston, Chung Ling Soo, David Copperfield, Lance Burton, Silvan, Siegfried & Roy, and Harry Blackstone, Jr. Parlor magic Parlor magic is done for larger audiences than close-up magic (which is for a few people or even one person) and for smaller audiences than stage magic. In parlor magic, the performer is usually standing and on the same level as the audience, which may be seated on chairs or even on the floor. According to the Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians by T.A. Waters, \\"The phrase [parlor magic] is often used as a pejorative to imply that an effect under discussion is not suitable for professional performance.\\" Also, many magicians consider the term \\"parlor\\" old fashioned and limiting, since this type of magic is often done in rooms much larger than the traditional parlor, or even outdoors. A better term for this branch of magic may be \\"platform\\", \\"club\\" or \\"cabaret\\". Examples of such magicians include Jeff McBride, David Abbott, Channing Pollock, Black Herman, and Fred Kaps. Close-up magic Close-up magic (or table magic) is performed with the audience close to the magician, sometimes even one-on-one. It usually makes use of everyday items as props, such as cards (see Card manipulation), coins (see Coin magic), and seemingly 'impromptu' effects. This may be called \\"table magic\\", particularly when performed as dinner entertainment. Ricky Jay, Mahdi Moudini, and Lee Asher, following in the traditions of Dai Vernon, Slydini, and Max Malini, are considered among the foremost practitioners of close-up magic. Escapology Escapology is the branch of magic that deals with escapes from confinement or restraints. Harry Houdini is a well-known example of an escape artist or escapologist. Pickpocket magic Pickpocket magicians use magic to misdirect members of the audience while removing wallets, belts, ties and other personal effects. It can be presented on a stage, in a cabaret setting, before small close-up groups, or even for one spectator. Well-known pickpockets include James Freedman, David Avadon, Bob Arno, and Apollo Robbins. Mentalism Mentalism creates the impression in the minds of the audience that the performer possesses special powers to read thoughts, predict events, control other minds, and similar feats. It can be presented on a stage, in a cabaret setting, before small close-up groups, or even for one spectator. Well-known mentalists of the past and present include Alexander, The Zancigs, Axel Hellstrom, Dunninger, Kreskin, Derren Brown, Rich Ferguson, Guy Bavli, Banachek, and Alain Nu. S√©ances Theatrical s√©ances simulate spiritualistic or mediumistic phenomena for theatrical effect. This genre of stage magic has been misused at times by charlatans pretending to actually be in contact with spirits. Children's magic Children's magic is performed for an audience primarily composed of children. It is typically performed at birthday parties, preschools, elementary schools, Sunday schools or libraries. This type of magic is usually comedic in nature and involves audience interaction as well as volunteer assistants. Online magic Online magic tricks were designed to function on a computer screen. The computer essentially replaces the magician. Some online magic tricks recreate traditional card tricks and require user participation, while others, like Plato's Cursed Triangle, are based on mathematical, geometrical and/or optical illusions. One such online magic trick, called Esmeralda's Crystal Ball, became a viral phenomenon that fooled so many computer users into believing that their computer had supernatural powers, that Snopes dedicated a page to debunking the trick. Mathemagic Mathemagic is a genre of stage magic that combines magic and mathematics. It is commonly used by children's magicians and mentalists. Corporate magic Corporate magic or trade show magic uses magic as a communication and sales tool, as opposed to just straightforward entertainment. Corporate magicians may come from a business background and typically present at meetings, conferences and product launches. They run workshops and can sometimes be found at trade shows, where their patter and illusions enhance an entertaining presentation of the products offered by their corporate sponsors. Pioneer performers in this arena include Eddie TullockBill Herz with Paul Harris. Secrets of the Astonishing Executive (New York: Avon Books, 1991). and Guy Bavli.Master of the Mind ‚Äì Guy Bavoi Gospel magic Gospel magic uses magic to catechize and evangelize. Gospel magic was first used by St. John Bosco to interest children in 19th-century Turin, Italy to come back to school, to accept assistance and to attend church. Street magic Street magic is a form of street performing or busking that employs a hybrid of stage magic, platform and close-up magic, usually performed 'in the round' or surrounded by the audience. Notable modern street magic performers include Jeff Sheridan and Gazzo. Since the first David Blaine TV special Street Magic aired in 1997, the term \\"street magic\\" has also come to describe a style of 'guerilla' performance in which magicians approach and perform for unsuspecting members of the public on the street. Unlike traditional street magic, this style is almost purely designed for TV and gains its impact from the wild reactions of the public. Magicians of this type include David Blaine and Cyril Takayama. Bizarre magic Bizarre magic uses mystical, horror, fantasy, and other similar themes in performance. Bizarre magic is typically performed in a close-up venue, although some performers have effectively presented it in a stage setting. Charles Cameron has generally been credited as the \\"godfather of bizarre magic\\". Others such as Tony Andruzzi have contributed significantly to its development. Shock magic Shock magic is a genre of magic that shocks the audience. Sometimes referred to as \\"geek magic\\", it takes its roots from circus sideshows, in which 'freakish' performances were shown to audiences. Common shock magic or geek magic effects include eating razor blades, needle-through-arm, string through neck and pen-through-tongue., Comedy magic Comedy magic is the use of magic in which is combined with stand-up comedy. Famous comedy magicians include The Amazing Johnathan, Mac King, and Penn & Teller. Quick change magic Quick change magic is the use of magic which is combined with the very quick changing of costumes. Famous quick change artists include Sos & Victoria Petrosyan. Camera magic Camera magic (or \\"video magic\\") is magic that is aimed at viewers watching broadcasts or recordings. It includes tricks based on the restricted viewing angles of cameras and clever editing. Camera magic often features paid extras posing as spectators who may even be assisting in the performance. Camera magic can be done live, such as Derren Brown's lottery prediction. Famous examples of camera magic include David Copperfield's Floating Over the Grand Canyon and many of Criss Angel's illusions. Classical magic Classical Magic is a style of magic that conveys feelings of elegance and skill akin to prominent magicians of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Notable classical magicians today include Yu Ho-Jin and Ryan Lally. Mechanical magic Ambigram Magic / Dream with a handheld pattern giving a reversed shadow by mirror symmetry. \\"It's all done with smoke and mirrors\\", as we say to explain something baffling. Mechanical magic is a form of stage magic in which the magician uses a variety of mechanical devices to perform acts which appear to be physically impossible. Examples include such things as a false-bottomed mortar in which the magician places an audience member's watch only to later produce several feet away inside a wooden frame. Mechanical magic requires a certain degree of sleight of hand and carefully functioning mechanisms and devices to be performed convincingly. This form of magic was popular around the turn of the 19th century‚Äî today, many of the original mechanisms used for this magic have become antique collector's pieces and may require significant and careful restoration to function. Categories of effects Magicians describe the type of tricks they perform in various ways. Opinions vary as to how to categorize a given effect, and disagreement as to what categories actually exist. For instance, some magicians consider \\"penetrations\\" a separate category, while others consider penetrations a form of restoration or teleportation. Some magicians today, such as Guy HollingworthHollingworth, Guy. \\"Waiting For Inspiration.\\" Genii Magazine. January 2008 ‚Äì December 2008. and Tom StoneStone, Tom. \\"Lodestones.\\" Genii Magazine. February 2009 have begun to challenge the notion that all magic effects fit into a limited number of categories. Among magicians who believe in a limited number of categories (such as Dariel Fitzkee, Harlan Tarbell, S.H. Sharpe), there has been disagreement as to how many different types of effects there are. Some of these are listed below. *Production: The magician produces something from nothing‚Äîa rabbit from an empty hat, a fan of cards from thin air, a shower of coins from an empty bucket, a dove from a pan, or the magician himself or herself, appearing in a puff of smoke on an empty stage‚Äîall of these effects are productions. *Vanish: The magician makes something disappear‚Äîa coin, a cage of doves, milk from a newspaper, an assistant from a cabinet, or even the Statue of Liberty. A vanish, being the reverse of a production, may use a similar technique in reverse. *Transformation: The magician transforms something from one state into another‚Äîa silk handkerchief changes color, a lady turns into a tiger, an indifferent card changes to the spectator's chosen card. Transformation: Change of color *Restoration: The magician destroys an object‚Äîa rope is cut, a newspaper is torn, a woman is cut in half, a borrowed watch is smashed to pieces‚Äîthen restores it to its original state. *Transposition: A transposition involves two or more objects. The magician will cause these objects to change places, as many times as he pleases, and in some cases, ends with a kicker by transforming the objects into something else. *Teleportation: The magician causes something to move from one place to another‚Äîa borrowed ring is found inside a ball of wool, a canary inside a light bulb, an assistant from a cabinet to the back of the theatre, or a coin from one hand to the other. When two objects exchange places, it is called a transposition: a simultaneous, double transportation. A transportation can be seen as a combination of a vanish and a production. When performed by a mentalist it might be called teleportation. *Escape: The magician (or less often, an assistant) is placed in a restraining device (i.e., handcuffs or a straitjacket) or a death trap, and escapes to safety. Examples include being put in a straitjacket and into an overflowing tank of water, and being tied up and placed in a car being sent through a car crusher. *Levitation: The magician defies gravity, either by making something float in the air, or with the aid of another object (suspension)‚Äîa silver ball floats around a cloth, an assistant floats in mid- air, another is suspended from a broom, a scarf dances in a sealed bottle, the magician levitates his own body in midair. There are many popular ways to create this illusion, including Asrah levitation, Balducci levitation, invisible thread, and King levitation. The flying illusion has often been performed by David Copperfield. Harry Blackstone floated a light bulb over the heads of the public. *Penetration: The magician makes a solid object pass through another‚Äîa set of steel rings link and unlink, a candle penetrates an arm, swords pass through an assistant in a basket, a salt shaker penetrates a tabletop, or a man walks through a mirror. Sometimes referred to as \\"solid- through-solid\\". *Prediction: The magician accurately predicts the choice of a spectator or the outcome of an event‚Äîa newspaper headline, the total amount of loose change in the spectator's pocket, a picture drawn on a slate‚Äîunder seemingly impossible circumstances. Many magic routines use combinations of effects. For example, in \\"cups and balls\\" a magician may use vanishes, productions, penetrations, teleportation and transformations as part of the one presentation. The methodology behind magic is often referred to as a science (often a branch of physics) while the performance aspect is more of an art form. Learning magic A stage magician using a top hat as a prop Dedication to magic can teach confidence and creativity, as well as the work ethic associated with regular practice and the responsibility that comes with devotion to an art. The teaching of performance magic was once a secretive practice. Professional magicians were unwilling to share knowledge with anyone outside the profession to prevent the laity from learning their secrets. This often made it difficult for an interested apprentice to learn anything but the basics of magic. Some had strict rules against members discussing magic secrets with anyone but established magicians. From the 1584 publication of Reginald Scot's Discoverie of Witchcraft until the end of the 19th century, only a few books were available for magicians to learn the craft, whereas today mass-market books offer a myriad titles. Videos and DVDs are a newer medium of tuition, but many of the methods found in this format are readily found in previously published books. However, they can serve as a visual demonstration. Persons interested in learning to perform magic can join magic clubs. Here magicians, both seasoned and novitiate, can work together and help one another for mutual improvement, to learn new techniques, to discuss all aspects of magic, to perform for each other‚Äîsharing advice, encouragement, and criticism. Before a magician can join one of these clubs, they usually have to audition. The purpose is to show to the membership they are a magician and not just someone off the street wanting to discover magic secrets. The world's largest magic organization is the International Brotherhood of Magicians; it publishes a monthly journal, The Linking Ring. The oldest organization is the Society of American Magicians, which publishes the monthly magazine M-U-M and of which Houdini was a member and president for several years. In London, England, there is The Magic Circle, which houses the largest magic library in Europe. Also PSYCRETS‚ÄîThe British Society of Mystery Entertainers‚Äîcaters specifically to mentalists, bizarrists, storytellers, readers, spiritualist performers, and other mystery entertainers. Davenport's Magic in London's The Strand was the world's oldest family-run magic shop. It is now closed. The Magic Castle in Hollywood, California, is home to the Academy of Magical Arts. Traditionally, magicians refuse to reveal the methods behind their tricks to the audience. Membership in professional magicians' organizations often requires a commitment never to reveal the secrets of magic to non-magicians. Magic performances tend to fall into a few specialties or genres. Stage illusions use large-scale props and even large animals. Platform magic is performed for a medium to large audience. Close-up magic is performed with the audience close to the magician. Escapology involves escapes from confinement or restraints. Pickpocket magicians take audience members' wallets, belts, and ties. Mentalism creates the illusion that the magician can read minds. Comedy magic is the use of magic combined with stand-up comedy, an example being Penn & Teller. Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Others argue that they can claim that the effects are due to magic. These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. Another issue is the use of deceptive practices for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance. Examples include fraudulent mediums, con men and grifters who use deception for cheating at card games. Misuse of magic Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Most of these performers therefore eschew the term \\"magician\\" (which they view as making a claim to supernatural power) in favor of \\"illusionist\\" and similar descriptions; for example, the performer Jamy Ian Swiss makes these points by billing himself as an \\"honest liar\\". Alternatively, many performers say that magical acts, as a form of theatre, need no more of a disclaimer than any play or film; this policy is advocated by the magician and mentalist Joseph Dunninger, who states \\"For those who believe, no explanation is necessary; for those who do not believe, no explanation will suffice.\\" These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. For example, more than thirty years after the illusionist Uri Geller made his first appearances on television in the 1970s to exhibit his self-proclaimed psychic ability to bend spoons, his actions still provoke controversy among some magic performers, because he claimed he was not using conjuring techniques. On the other hand, because Geller bent‚Äîand continues to bend‚Äîspoons within a performance context and has lectured at several magic conventions, the Dunninger quote may be said to apply. Less fraught with controversy, however, may be the use of deceptive practices by those who employ conjuring techniques for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance. Fraudulent mediums have long capitalized on the popular belief in paranormal phenomena to prey on the bereaved for financial gain. From the 1840s to the 1920s, during the greatest popularity of the Spiritualism religious movement as well as public interest in s√©ances, a number of fraudulent mediums used conjuring methods to perform illusions such as table-knocking, slate-writing, and telekinetic effects, which they attributed to the actions of ghosts or other spirits. The great escapologist and illusionist Harry Houdini devoted much of his time to exposing such fraudulent operators.Harry Houdini. A Magician Among the Spirits (New York: Harper and Bros., 1924) Magician James Randi, magic duo Penn & Teller, and the mentalist Derren Brown have also devoted much time to investigating and debunking paranormal, occult, and supernatural claims.One-Million-Dollar Challenge from MIT Media Lab: Affective Computing Group Fraudulent faith healers have also been shown to employ sleight of hand to give the appearance of removing chicken-giblet \\"tumors\\" from patients' abdomens. Con men and grifters too may use techniques of conjuring for fraudulent goals. Cheating at card games is an obvious example, and not a surprising one: one of the most respected textbooks of card techniques for magicians, The Expert at the Card Table by Erdnase, was primarily written as an instruction manual for card sharps. The card trick known as \\"Find the Lady\\" or \\"Three-card Monte\\" is an old favourite of street hustlers, who lure the victim into betting on what seems like a simple proposition: to identify, after a seemingly easy-to-track mixing sequence, which one of three face-down cards is the Queen. Another example is the shell game, in which a pea is hidden under one of three walnut shells, then shuffled around the table (or sidewalk) so slowly as to make the pea's position seemingly obvious. Although these are well known as frauds, people still lose money on them; a shell-game ring was broken up in Los Angeles as recently as December 2009.Andrew Blankenstein. \\"8 Arrested in Downtown Shell-Game Operation,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 10, 2009. Researching magic Because of the secretive nature of magic, research can be a challenge. Many magic resources are privately held and most libraries only have small populist collections of magicana. However, organizations exist to band together independent collectors, writers, and researchers of magic history, including the Magic Collectors' Association, which publishes a quarterly magazine and hosts an annual convention; and the Conjuring Arts Research Center, which publishes a monthly newsletter and biannual magazine, and offers its members use of a searchable database of rare books and periodicals. Performance magic is particularly notable as a key area of popular culture from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries. Many performances and performers can be followed through newspapers of the time. Many books have been written about magic tricks; so many are written every year that at least one magic authorBart King, The Pocket Guide to Magic, Gibbs Smith, 2009 has suggested that more books are written about magic than any other performing art. Although the bulk of these books are not seen on the shelves of libraries or public bookstores, the serious student can find many titles through specialized stores catering to the needs of magic performers. Several notable public research collections on magic are the WG Alma Conjuring Collection at the State Library of Victoria; the R. B. Robbins Collection of Stage Magic and Conjuring at the State Library of NSW; the H. Adrian Smith Collection of Conjuring and Magicana at Brown University; and the Carl W. Jones Magic Collection, 1870s‚Äì1948 at Princeton University.

Although there exist a theory of consciousness bearing the same name (illusionism), it is important to note that the two theories are concerned with different subjects. Illusionism as discussed here, holds that people have illusory beliefs about free will. Furthermore, it holds that it is both of key importance and morally right that people not be disabused of these beliefs, because the illusion has benefits both to individuals and to society. Belief in hard incompatibilism, argues Smilansky, removes an individual's basis for a sense of self-worth in his or her own achievements. It is \\"extremely damaging to our view of ourselves, to our sense of achievement, worth, and self-respect\\". Neither compatibilism nor hard determinism are the whole story, according to Smilansky, and there exists an ultimate perspective in which some parts of compatibilism are valid and some parts of hard determinism are valid. However, Smilansky asserts, the nature of what he terms the fundamental dualism between hard determinism and compatibilism is a morally undesirable one, in that both beliefs, in their absolute forms, have adverse consequences. The distinctions between choice and luck made by compatibilism are important, but wholly undermined by hard determinism. But, conversely, hard determinism undermines the morally important notions of justice and respect, leaving them nothing more than \\"shallow\\" notions. Smilansky's thesis is considered a radical one, and other philosophers disagree with it. Professor Derk Pereboom of Cornell University, for example, disagrees that hard incompatibilism necessarily does away with self-worth, because to a large extent that sense of self-worth isn't related to will at all, let alone to free will. Aspects of worthiness such as natural beauty, native physical ability, and intelligence are not voluntary. James Lenman takes a similar line, arguing that Smilansky's expression of the problems is overstated. The problems that he presents are less fundamentally metaphysical than simply practical in nature. References  Reference bibliography    Further reading   *Garifullin R.R.

His younger brothers (Edachena Komappan Nair, Edachena Othenan Nair and Edachena Ammu) joined him as generals. Kunkan was a popular leader in Wayanad, gathering support from people of many classes for Raja's war against the East India Company. Commander Under Kunkan's leadership, Pazhassi's troops fought against Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan as far as the outskirts of Mysore. This enlarged the Raja's sphere of influence, and he claimed territories as far as Nanjangud. During Hyder's siege of Thalasseri, with help from Chirakkal and Kadathanad [1779‚Äì1782], Raja sent 1,000 troops commanded by Kunkan (who repulsed all assaults by the Mysore army). The siege was later broken by a joint British-Pazhassi attack in 1782. Capture of Panamaram Fort The British increased taxes on farmers and demanded half the rice crop, to the dissatisfaction of the Wyanad people. When a member of the British Raj demanded a paddy field, Kunkan killed him and 150 Kurichiyans under Thalakkal Chandu then joined him. With these troops and his brothers' support, Kunkan attacked the fort at Panamaram. It was guarded by 70 soldiers from the 1st Battalion of the 4th Bombay Infantry under Captain Dickenson and Lieutenant Maxwell; both commanders and 25 soldiers were killed on 11 October 1802. After massacring the detachment, Kunkan acquired 112 muskets and six boxes of ammunition, with a value of ‚Çπ6,000. The buildings were razed, igniting a widespread revolt in Wayanad against British rule. Guerilla warfare Shortly afterwards, Kunkan went to the Pulpally Pagoda and appealed to all Wayandians to join the rebel ranks; three thousand men volunteered. From then until early 1804, Pazhassi rebels launched guerrilla attacks on British positions throughout North Malabar, reaching the coastal towns of Kannur, Thalassery and Kozhikode. Kunkan confronted the British twice: in 1802 at Wayanad, where he tried to block British troops en route to Mananthavadi and in 1803 when he tried to besiege an outpost at Pazhassi. Both failed, leading him to concentrate on guerrilla warfare. The British announced a reward of 1,000 pagodas for Kunkan's arrest. By November 1805, the rebels were on the run and after Raja's death, Kunkan (\\"that determined and incorrigible rebel\\") was killed by British troops at Panniyil (now Pannichal) in Edavaka. Memorial The people of Kerala have asked the government to build a memorial at Panamaram to Kunkan and Thalakkal Chanthu, since the Pazhassi rebellion is considered one of the most important uprisings against the British in South India. In popular culture In the 2009 Hariharan directed film Pazhassi Raja, Mammootty played the title role while Edachena Kungan was portrayed, by Sarath Kumar.

The chorale cantata is based on Martin Luther's Advent hymn \\"Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland\\". It is part of his chorale cantata cycle.  History and words  Bach wrote the cantata in 1724, his second year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, for the First Sunday of Advent. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Romans, night is advanced, day will come (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the Entry into Jerusalem (). The cantata is based on Martin Luther's Advent hymn in eight stanzas \\"\\", the number one hymn to begin the Liturgical year in all Lutheran hymnals. The unknown poet retained the first and last stanza, paraphrased stanzas 2 and 3 to an aria, stanzas 4 and 5 to a recitative, the remaining stanzas to an aria and a duet recitative. Bach first performed the cantata on 3 December 1724, and he performed it again in 1736, adding a part for violone in all movements, after the had bought an instrument at an auction in 1735. Bach's successor Johann Friedrich Doles performed the cantata after Bach's death.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in six movements is scored for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of horn only to support the chorale melody, two oboes, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. # Chorale: # Aria (tenor): # Recitative (bass): # Aria (bass): # Recitative (soprano, alto): # Chorale:  Music  The old hymn tune is in four lines, the last one equal to the first. The instrumental ritornello of the opening chorus already quotes this line, first in the continuo, then slightly different in meter in the oboes. Other than these quotes, the orchestra plays a free concerto with the oboes introducing a theme, the first violin playing figuration. The ritornello appears shortened three times to separate the lines of the text and in full at the end. The soprano sings the in long notes, while the lower voices prepare each entry in imitation. Alfred D√ºrr suggests that Bach was inspired to the festive setting in 6/4 time by the entry into Jerusalem. Christoph Wolff stresses that the instrumentation is simple because Advent was a \\"season of abstinence\\". Church music was allowed in Leipzig only on the first Sunday of Advent. John Eliot Gardiner observes about all three extant cantatas for this occasion, also , and , which all deal with Luther's hymn, that they \\"display a sense of excitement at the onset of the Advent season. This can be traced back both to qualities inherent in the chorale tune itself, and to the central place Bach gives to Luther's words.\\" The first aria deals with the mystery of \\"the Supreme Ruler appears to the world, ‚Ä¶ the purity will be entirely unblemished.\\" in siciliano rhythm and string accompaniment, doubled in tutti- sections by the oboes. In great contrast the second aria stresses fight, \\"Struggle, conquer, powerful hero!\\", in a continuo line. In a later version it is doubled by the upper strings. Gardiner regards its \\"pompous, combative character\\" as a sketch for the aria \\"\\" (#8) from Part I of Bach's Christmas Oratorio. The duet recitative expresses thanks, \\"We honor this glory\\", intimately accompanied by the strings. The closing stanza is a four-part setting.

Career Chhabria started his career by joining his family business of running a shop named Raja Radio, trading radio assemblies and electronic components (mainly of Philips India) on Lamington Road in Mumbai. He moved to Dubai in 1973, to run Jumbo Electronics, a sales agency owned by his family trading in the same products as in Mumbai. Dubai was at that time an obscure backwater, and in 1974, Chhabria was able to bag a contract with Sony, the Japanese electronics manufacturer, for Jumbo Electronics to become the sole distributors of Sony in the UAE. To his great good fortune, the oil boom began after the Oil Crisis of 1973 and swampy, backward Dubai became flush with oil money. Chhabria's business as exclusive dealer of Sony's products flourished at a scale he could never have dreamt possible, there were no taxes of any sort in Dubai, and Chhabria was soon a man of immense wealth. In India, during his bonhomie with Sony, he started a Sony branded Color/BW TV/Portable Audio system manufacturing/assembly unit in 80's in Mumabai in the name of Orson Electronics Ltd, that was one of the pioneers in India in that industry. Orson came much before Onida or Videocon and others in modern Electronics field in India and was the number one. In audio field, it was beating Philips. But unfortunately, due to mismanaged operations and mainly due to pumping out hard cash from the profits to Chhabria in Dubai, soon that empire collapsed. Orson was one of the first to revolutionize Production/Inventory/Sales in Electronics Industry through in-house computer system and applications. By 1991, Orson was a dead unit. Chhabria leveraged this money and his contacts through the Sindhi community to which he belonged, to make some spectacular takeovers of undervalued or ailing but fundamentally sound corporates in India. A series of widely publicized corporate takeovers made Chhabria notorious in India as a \\"corporate raider\\" without precedent in the staid and old-world environment of India. His significant takeovers included Shaw Wallace, the liquor giant; and Dunlop, the ailing rubber tires giant, which he took over jointly in 1984 with R. P. Goenka's RPG Group (he later became the single largest shareholder when he bought out RPG's stake).Manu Chhabria and Hinduja Takeovers Corporate takeovers in India, by Vijay Kumar Kaushal. Sarup & Sons, 1995. , p. 103-111. It is noteworthy that Chhabria's takeovers and acquisitions were not informed by any considerations of business synergies or complementarities. They were targeted by him for takeover based on market undervaluation and weaknesses in the share-holding pattern, and it was speculated in the press at that time that his intention was not to run any of the companies but to strip them of their assets and then abandon them. His major acquisitions were the following six companies: Shaw Wallace (liquor manufacturer), Dunlop India and Falcon Tyres (both rubber tire manufacturers), Hindustan Dorr Oliver (water treatment and pollution control projects), Mather & Platt (pump-set manufacturers) and Gordon Woodroffe (freight carrier). The total asset value of these companies ran to about $600 million Downturn Chhabria was unable to sustain his acquisitions, not only because of the utter absence of synergy in his companies, but also because nothing in his education or business background prepared him for running a corporate of any size, least of all corporates that were undervalued since they were facing problems of various types for internal or external reasons. Unfortunately, Chhabria's way of dealing with situations was mainly to shout abuse at his senior employees, often in front of line workers, and threaten them with the sack. Much of the talent that he had inherited from previous managements was lost due to these shenanigans. He also took to \\"head-hunting,\\" which involved offering fantastic salaries to good performers in competitor companies to come work for him. He would then expect them to produce results in a matter of weeks, with no other facilitation or investment. He ran his companies on fear often taking legal action against former employees who left his employment voluntarily. This approach proved equally disastrous. Recognizing the fundamental deficiency in his own profile, Chhabria spent a few weeks attending a short-term course at Harvard Business School, but no miracle emerged from this initiative either. What did emerge was the fact that Chhabria had been more creative than prudent in his accounting and fund-raising practises. His takeover tactics had left him with numerous powerful enemies in industry and a trust deficit in government and the money markets. A slew of legal cases were filed against him in both his personal and official capacities, for crimes ranging from fraud (numerous cases) to bribery to tax evasion to illegal share dealings to non- payment of employee provident fund obligations. The courts in India issued non-bailable warrants against him and he was to be arrested as soon as he set foot on Indian soil. He was therefore unable to visit India, where all his companies were based, for more than a decade before his death. He came precariously close to being proclaimed a fugitive by the government of India. Cases were also filed against him in Hong Kong courts. One of the long running legal actions related to his take over of the Shaw Wallace distilling and brewing group where it was alleged that had done so in partnership with Vijay Mallya of the Kingfisher brewing group, who was prohibited from taking over of Shaw Wallace for regulatory reasons. This takeover also spawned litigation between Chhabria and his brother Kishore who he had sent to back to India to run the business and who it was alleged had many of the Shaw Wallace brands transferred to his own interests. In less than a decade after the heady days of 1984, Chhabria found that not one of his acquisitions were doing well; all were embroiled in serious litigation; and his name and credit were reviled universally. His flagship, Shaw Wallace, faced 110 winding-up petitions filed by 178 creditors. Falcon Tyres and Dunlop Tyres came under BIFR (bankruptcy proceedings) and were later sold to the Ruia group. At Mather & Platt, the workers' union petitioned the Company Law Board (CLB) to remove Chhabria from the driving seat and this was done. Orson Ltd simply folded up and was liquidated. Death Chhabria died in Mumbai April 6, 2002, following a heart attack, at the age of 56. He was survived by his wife Vidhya Manohar Chhabria and by three daughters, Komal, Bhavika and Kiran. Komal Rajiv Wazir now runs Chhabria's most famous takeover, Shaw Wallace; Bhavika Godhwani runs Hindustan Dorr Oliver, another takeover, while Kiran Chhabria runs Jumbo, the original Chhabria venture, in Dubai.

The Venetians managed to regroup and subdued the Croats. There followed a famous interaction between the two groups before the Venetians executed the Croats.

The species is cultivated for use in gardens and as a street tree. Description A tree, small and stout in form, with beautiful flowers. It reaches between in height in its native habitat which has a spreading habit. It produces clusters of orange barrel-shaped buds with horned caps, which are followed by prolific red or pink flowers between August and December. The bark is rough and is persistent on the trunk and branches. The bark is fibrous-flaky box type grey-black, grey or black colour bark with whitish patches. The leaves are greyish green in colour, the blade has a lanceolate shape and is in length and wide. The leaves are basally tapered, the petioles are quadrangular or narrowly flattened or channelled. The conflorescences have a diameter that are with flowers that are normally coral- pink in colour but white, cream and red flowered plants are known.

The fruits that form later have a cylindrical shape with a depressed disc and enclosed valves. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Johann George Luehmann in 1897 in Victorian Naturalist. The type specimen was collected by W.A. Macpherson from near Coolgardie. The species name torquata is taken from the latin word torquatus meaning having a twisted ring or collar. This refers to the corrugated structure found at the base of the buds and fruit. Amongst the common names of the species is the use of Christmas tree, given for flowers that appear in December, and Goldfields red flowering gum for the region's mining operations.

It is a Jama Masjid (Congregational Mosque). The Juma Masjid, Palayam Mosque is the most important mosque in Thiruvananthapuram. In Palayam, the mosque has a temple and a Christian church as its neighbours, establishing the communal harmony of Keralites. Palayam Juma Mosque and St.Josephs Cathedral as seen from Chandrashekharan Nair Stadium History The history of the Palayam Mosque at Trivandrum dates back to 1813 AD, when the British Indian Second Regiment was stationed here. It was then constructed as a small mosque (Pattalappalli), with an open place for Eid prayers. In 1824 when the sixth regiment was posted here its officers bought up the land appointed a Qazi the Labba family which ended with Sheikh Mansoor Labba and entrusted the Muezzin the documents of the mosque. In 1848, when the sixteenth regiment came here its Jamadars and Havildars did considerable improvements to the mosque including the construction of a gate and arrangements for the maintenance and upkeep of the mosque building. When other regiments were stationed here, its officers brought about further changes and improvements. Thus the mosque is nearly 200 years old. Later, in the 1960s, many philanthropic businessmen and government officials of Trivandrum took up its renovation and constructed the present-day Palayam Juma Masjid under the leadership of the Qazi and Imam Moulavi Sheikh Abul Hassan Ali Al-Noori. The Juma Masjid was inaugurated by the President of India Dr. Zakir Hussain in 1967. Sheikh Abul Hassan Ali Al- Noori (1921-2011), a freedom fighter, multilingual scholar and the first Imam of Palayam Juma Masjid who served here for close to two decades (1959-1979), helped elevate to its present-day status from a ‚Äòpattalappalli‚Äô, during his tenure as Imam. First Imam Palayalam Juma Masjid and Martyr's Column Sheikh Abul Hassan Ali Al-Noori, the first elected Imam, was born in 1921 in Thenkassi. He was elected to serve after Sheikh Mansoor Labba who served as the Hanafi Imam for over 46 years. He had his schooling at Rajapalayam and graduation at Tanjavur. Left for Burma for post graduate studies and became a teacher in Rangoon. He was proficient in nine languages including Arabic, Urdu, Persian, Malay and Burmese. In 1942, he became active in the Quit India Movement in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. He became an Imam in Thenkasi in 1952. From 1959 onwards, close to two decades, he was the Imam and Qazi at the Palayam Juma Masjid. The author of several books, a noted orator, social reformer and teacher, he entertained a progressive outlook, championing women's education, criticising the dowry system and promoting interest-free banking. 'Darul amaana' -- an interest-free microfinance system in 1970 -- launched under his guidance.

Formerly known as Elegy, the band had to change its name in November 2009, when the underground success of their debut album attracted the attention of Universal Records. They then became known as Riddare av Koden, and currently perform and release under that name.  Musical characteristics  Riddare av Koden is influenced by a range of bands and artists over many different genres. Their music has often been described as hard-hitting, guitar-driven Melodic Death Metal, heavily incorporating full-bodied classical elements reminiscent of powerful film scores.  Band history   Elegy era (October 2006 ‚Äì November 2009)  Elegy was formed in October 2006, by brothers Nathan and Daniel Wilson, who were 17 and 23 at the time. The two brothers asked Shay Kallie to assume lead guitar duties, having been childhood friends and sharing a passion in Heavy Metal. The trio then began writing songs and looking for a vocalist and bassist. Travis Seager then joined the band as vocalist. Kevin Webber was asked to join the band temporarily to complete the line-up for their first show in Secunda, Mpumalanga. Kevin Webber became a permanent member in the band, and strong friendships began forming between the members of Elegy. After their first show, the band began working on an LP to gain entry into the South African Metal scene. During this period, Travis Seager left to pursue his career as an artist. Shay then assumed lead vocal duties and Elegy went into studio to record their debut LP - \\"A Voice Will Call\\", which landed them a distribution deal with Electromode Records - South Africa's biggest distribution label. In November 2009 the label received a letter from Universal Records, stating that they were illegally using the Elegy name, which is registered to the Dutch Power Metal band of the same name.  Riddare av Koden era (November 2009 ‚Äì present)  Elegy began searching for new names, opening up the debate to fans worldwide. Within a week of receiving the change notice they announced that their new name was to be \\"Riddare av Koden\\". The name change caused much controversy between fans and the public, and was announced officially on 16 November 2009. In May 2010, Riddare av Koden began working with Multi-instrumentalist and Composer Steven de Pina and, in September 2010 he was officially welcomed into the band as Keyboardist and Folk instrumentalist. Riddare av Koden was named the official support act for the Ensiferum South African tour of October 2010. In April 2011, Daniel Wilson (one of the two founding members) announced his departure from the band. Riddare av Koden took a break from constant live performance in 2011 and only played exclusive shows and festivals throughout the year with Cameron Zuccarelli on drums and their very first International performance in Gaborone, Botswana. They released \\"A Voice Will Call\\" for free download worldwide, and grew to 40,000 Fans on Facebook. 2012 didn't see performance activity from the band as the members of Riddare av Koden were on a Sabbatical/Hiatus. Later that year, Nathan Wilson and Kevin Webber also announced their departure. = Heimdall av Koden = Shay av Koden began composing new music and looking for musicians to test the suites in a Live environment. He adopted the stage name \\"Heimdall av Koden\\". Thomas Hughes was asked to play drums for Riddare. Thomas had come from a technical death metal background, as well as being the drummer for Ska Punk Legends - Fuzigish. Thomas then suggested that they ask Pepi Petkov to assume second guitar/vocal duties. Pepi had come from Autumn Sun, a Melodic Death Metal band, having toured with the likes of Kreator, Cradle of Filth and other big names. = Dynasty (EP) = On 23 May 2013, Riddare av Koden debuted \\"Mjolnir\\", \\"The √Üsir\\", and \\"The Battle Ov Bifrost Bridge\\", live in Johannesburg, South Africa with William Bishop on bass. = Dynasty (LP) = During this time, the concept & artwork for \\"Dynasty\\" was created by Jason Enslin & Heimdall av Koden.

It is the third entry in the Arcana Heart series, following the events of Arcana Heart 2. The game went through location tests in Japan starting in late 2011, and was officially released on September 20, 2011. An official PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 version was later released on February 6, 2013. An American (PlayStation Network only) version was released on August 20, 2013 by Aksys Games and in Europe on October 2, 2013 by Zen United. An update for the game, called , with rebalanced gameplay and new game modes was released in Japan on May 8, 2013 for Arcades, and later released for PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows. This was followed by , which was released in arcades on December 4, 2014, and later released on Microsoft Windows on December 13, 2017. The latest update version known as was announced on April 24, 2019, adding three more characters who were originally meant to be DLC characters in original Love Max Six Stars update, despite Team Arcana no longer with Examu, after the team's former parent company dismissed from video game business as of the end of February 2020.https://www.twitter.com/examu_PR/status/1120947560154161152 Gameplay Arcana Heart 3 continues the series' usage of Arcana or celestial beings based on the characters from the Tarot. In addition to the 23 playable characters, the 23 Arcana each have their own unique powers, to augment the abilities of the girls. The game adds a Force Gauge to the fighting system. When completely filled, the Force Gauge allows the player to perform an Extend Force, a maneuver similar to the Arcana Burst from earlier games. The game also adds a \\"Simple Mode\\" which simplifies the control layout into a single button for each major function: one button for normal attacks, one button for special moves, one button for moves involving Arcana, and one button for the game's Homing Dash ability. The console versions have a fully voiced story mode and HD anime graphics for super moves. They also include a training mode, score attack, and online play. Plot The game's setting takes place in a fictional, somewhat futuristic Japan combined with fantasy elements. In the previous game, Arcana Heart 2, a dimensional distortion occurred in the country's Kanto region, caused by the primordial being known as Angelia Avallone. This event came to be known as the \\"Great Kanto Incident\\". The international Holy Spirit Institutions suffered harshly after the \\"Great Kanto Incident\\", but restoration has begun and about two months have elapsed. In this time, a family that had received technical assistance during the war in Europe created \\"The Drexler Institution\\" to resume its activities around the world. The Drexler Institution was hiding in Japan. Western Europe was devastated by the Office of the Holy Spirit led by Mildred who had since defected. The West Branch of the Holy Spirit Rosenberg Agency had to be completely reconstituted. Shortly thereafter, a large number of dimensional distortions were observed throughout Japan. \\"Drexler\\" was a little unusual and unnatural with its authority behind the scenes too. Japan embarked on a convergence of the Holy Office to gain control of the situation. They were looking closely into part of an area in Japan that educates several \\"Maidens\\". This newcomer given the ability of a \\"Maiden\\" had begun her activities from the branch in Rosenberg. With the authority acquired from Drexler, a major order had been given to sink the entirety of Japan after six days. Characters Arcana Heart 3 released with a cast of 23 playable characters, with twenty returning from previous games in the series and three new playable characters (and corresponding Arcana). The Love Max Six Stars!!!!!! update introduced the fourth character on release. As part of a stretch goal of the Kickstarter campaign for the Steam release of Love Max Six Stars!!!!!!, a fifth new character was added for Love Max Six Stars Xtend!!!!!! alongside the other two yet to be announced character. Introduced in Arcana Heart 3 * : is the last and newest of the three main protagonists of the game, alongside Heart Aino and Petra Johanna Lagerkvist. She is a girl working in a secret company named \\"Valkyria\\", a branch of the Drexler Institute. She is sent to investigate the cause of the catastrophe that is happening around and to stand on one's own. Little is known about her. Her Arcana is Gottfried, the Arcana of Sword, an artificial Arcana called a Geist which takes its name from Gottfried Feder. Drexler has developed an armored Holy Spirit inspired by the Norse war god Tyr. * : , the secondary antagonist of the game, is another one of the young girls trained by the Drexler Institute, much like Wei√ü. However, Scharlachrot stands against her in an extremely obsessive manner bordering on dependence. After the organization was taken down by Petra, Scharlachrot went missing. However, she reappears in order to oppose Wei√ü and the rest of the cast. She is the mid-boss character of the game. Her Arcana is Baldur, the Arcana of Fang who is also a Geist. It shares its name with Baldur von Schirach. The Drexler Institute-based Baldur on Fenrir, the massive wolf from Norse mythology. * : (Eko) (Kazu) is a girl who has the unique ability to move energy into something so that it can move on its own, which she mainly focuses on drawings. She shares a mutually dependent relationship with her \\"brother,\\" , which resembles a large child's drawing. Since Petra had destroyed some of these \\"protection organizations\\", not much was known of Eko after that. She does seem to want to find Petra so that they can draw and play together. Eko's Arcana is Saligrama, the Arcana of Luck, which resembles a spirit with a die inside. * is the main antagonist and final boss of the game.

Only women can create and own them. The two terms are regional variants: both are used in eastern Iceland, 'tilberi' in the north and 'snakkur' in the south and west. There are no written mentions of the creatures before the 17th century, although one 17th- century writer mentions a witch being punished for having one in 1500. To create a tilberi, the woman steals a rib from a recently buried body early on Whitsunday, twists around it grey wool which she must steal for the purpose (it is sometimes specified that the wool must be plucked from between the shoulders of a widow's sheep soon after its wool has been plucked) and keeps it between her breasts. The next three Sundays at communion she spits the sanctified wine on the bundle, which will come more alive each time.Simpson, pp. 170-71.. She then lets it suckle on the inside of her thigh, which creates a tell-tale wartlike growth.Simpson, p. 171. The woman can now send the tilberi to suck milk from others' cows and ewes. It will return to the window of her dairy and call out \\"Full belly, Mummy!\\" or \\"Churn lid off, Mummy!\\" and vomit the stolen milk into her butter churn. To suck the milk from the animal's udder, it jumps on her back and lengthens itself to reach down; in some versions it is said to be able to reach down on both sides to suck from two teats at once. Inflammatory hardening of the udder was traditionally ascribed to the tilberi, and as late as the 19th century, animals were protected by making the sign of the cross under the udder and over the rump and laying a Psalter on the spine.Simpson, p. 172. Butter churned from milk stolen by a tilberi will clump together as if curdled, or even melt away into foam, if the sign of the cross is made over it or the smj√∂rhn√∫tur (butterknot) magical sign drawn in it. The tilberi also occasionally steals wool which has been put out to dry after shearing and washing; it rolls it around itself to form a giant moving ball.Simpson, p. 173. If the woman has a child and the tilberi manages to reach her own milk-filled breast, she is at risk of being sucked to death. The traditional method of ridding oneself of a tilberi is to send it up the mountain to the common pasturage with orders to collect all the lambs' droppings; either all those in three pastures, or making three piles. The tilberi will then either work itself to death or die because as an evil creature it cannot tolerate the number three. Only the human bone will be left lying in the pasture. A tilberi is very fast, but when chased it was believed to run home to its mother and hide under her skirts; her petticoat could then be tied or sewn closed under it and mother and creature either burnt or drowned together.

A bottle of 14 year old Clynelish The original Clynelish distillery was built in 1819, adjacent to the present operational Clynelish distillery which was built in 1967. When Clynelish first started distilling, in the years 1820-1822 they were producing around 12,000 gallons (around 54,000 litres) Over the years the distillery passed from owner to owner until the distillery expanded around 1896 and was upped to around 580,000 litres.Dr Patrick Brossard : BRORA ; A Legendary Distillery (1819-1983) and Whisky This was when they added in extra warehouses on site. However, in the 1960s, more and more of Clynelish's spirit was going into the blends, and in the 1960s there was a boom and people were buying more luxury items such as cars and whisky. So they needed to up their production levels. So in 1967 they built the current distillery they produce in today. The two distilleries ran side- by-side as Clynelish A and Clynelish B for a while as they wanted to make sure they had perfected the taste in the new space, then closed the older distillery the following year. However, in the following years, Caol Ila distillery faced a drought and closed for a year and did refurbishments. Johnnie Walker was missing this peated whisky in their blends and needed something to go in its place. So Clynelish reopened the original distillery in May 1969, under the name Brora Distillery, and started making Brora whisky. Brora's PPM levels (Phenol Parts per Million) ‚Äì which is what is used to talk about the level of peat used in the whisky - started at around 30-35 PPM, which is on level with Caol Ila (30-35 PPM) and Lagavulin (35-40 PPM). Brora went into the blends for one year whilst Caol Ila was closed and then continued to make the whisky as a single malt and ran until July 1983. Following closure in 1983, Brora whisky has become one of the most rare and desired whiskies in the world, costing around one and a half thousand pounds a bottle. Brora's latest, and last release of the original spirit is in their bi-centenary bottling, to celebrate the 200 years of the distillery being in production. This bottling is a 40 year old Brora selected to celebrate this, making 1819 bottles to represent the first year the distillery first started producing. Clynelish has had a strong connection with Johnnie Walker blended whisky for many years. Around 95% of the spirit is used in Johnnie Walker, Most commonly found in the Gold Label Reserve.

They can also be known as Pinnoctopus cordiformis, is found in the waters around New Zealand and southern Australia. M. maorum is one of the largest and most aggressive octopus species living in the New Zealand and Australian waters. They feed mainly on crustaceans and fish. Although they have a short life span, the females lay thousands of eggs and are very protective of them. Identification Macroctopus maorum is a large octopus and it is regularly described as a ‚Äòrobust‚Äô species, it is a member of the Octopus macropus species complex. The morphological traits characteristic of this complex are a high number of gill lamellae, a robust conical copulatory organ and arms of varying length with long unequal dorsal arms generally four to six times longer than the mantle. Although being unequal, their arms are said to be long and evenly tapering and Macroctopus maorum are even known to regrow arms when one has been lost. Being the largest member of its complex arm span is said to exceed . They have four to six suckers on the first and second arm pairs which are usually about in size. Suckers are arranged in two rows down the arm length. There is thought to be no correlation between sexes and size of suckers; however, there was an increase in sucker size with body mass increase. Coloration of this species can vary Macroctopus maorum can be distinguished from other species by the colour, they will be either orange-brown or dark purple-grey. The octopus has numerous small iridescent white spots on the web, arms and dorsal arm crown but there are no spots present on the mantle. Macroctopus maorum has 12‚Äì14 gill lamella per demibranch, the mantle is described as broadly ovoid and exhibits a skin pattern of longitudinal ridges. Along the dorsum there are five rows of unbranched papillae and two more papillae appear individually above the eyes. Octopus papillae are camouflage specialised with the ability to change shape, such as by extending in and out from the body. Male M. maorum have a small ligula, the ligula is a specialised arm tip on the hectocotylized arm which grips to allow the transfer of spermatophores. Within the complex O. macropus, Macroctopus maorum is thought to be the largest member. In a study estimating M. maorum size based on a sample of 90 beaks, the largest individual found had a body length of and body mass of 12 kg. Macroctopus maorum has an upper beak and lower beak, the upper beak can be used to differentiate Macroctopus maorum and Enteroctpus zealandicus as it has a lack of overlap in the ratio of upper hood length and upper chest length. Macroctopus maorum hatchlings are usually about 5.06 mm in size, they have 7‚Äì8 suckers per arm and each dorsal arm will have 6‚Äì11 chromatophores. Life cycle/Phenology Sexual maturity =Female= assigned 5 maturity stages for the egg development of Macroctopus maorum: # Newly formed primary oogonia which has a small, distinct nucleus is visible and Follucular cells attach to the ovum and forming follicular epithelium. # Follicular epithelium has completely filled the ova and nucleus is no longer visible. There are no yolk present and cuboidal follicular cells become distinct and closely packed. # First granular yolk appears in the ova. Epithelial convolution still occupying much of the interval volume. # Only periphery of the ova found and been forced out by the expanding yolk. Nuclei of epithelium has now become indistinct. # Mature ova which have thin walls and are replete with yolk. Follicular epithelium produced the chorion and degenerated. Ova is free in the ovary, oviduct or oviducal glands. Female that undergoes stage 4 oocytes were caught throughout the month of April to October, while those females that undergo stage 3 were caught only in April and July. However, females with stage 5 oocytes were caught every month except May and August. =Male= In the male, the position of testis from juvenile to adult is different. The position of testis moved backward until it reached the final position at the hinder end of the body during the adult stage. Fully mature male octopus consist of fully- formed spermatophores in the Needham‚Äôs sac. They usually had up to 13 spermatophores in the Needham‚Äôs sac. Furthermore, their reproductive organ will increase in size over the lifetime. Mating During mating, the male Macroctopus maorum will be on top pinning down the female and usually overpowering the female physically or pouncing on them. The male will inserts a sperm packet by passing it along the arms to the oviduct of the female. When it get near to the oviduct, the end of the spermatophore burst open and released the sperm.. Mather, J. A., Anderson, R. C. & Wood, J.B. (2010) Octopus: The Ocean‚Äôs Intelligent Invertebrate. Timber Press Male octopus will then become senescent and die after mating. Female \\"Macroctopus maorum mature and mate during March and October. Eggs laying, brooding and hatching Macroctopus maorum construct the posterior mantle to push out the eggs during egg laying. The female usually will stop eating for 2 weeks during the laying eggs period and continue to look after the eggs until they hatched. \\"Macroctopus maorum\\" usually lay approximate 7000 eggs. Their eggs are usually clusters of 3-12 eggs and cemented directly to the substratum. \\"Octopus maorum swept across the eggs sheet with one or more tentacles to keep the eggs well oxygenated, clean and safe from predators. During brooding period female Macroctopus maorum will stop feeding so that it produce less wastes and ensure the water quality is good for the eggs. When the eggs are about to hatch Macroctopus maorum will frequently squirt water on the eggs using siphon until the eggs hatched. After the eggs hatch, the female Macroctopus maorum will swim away and might die as she has been weakened from guarding the eggs. The hatchlings are planktonic and have 7 to 8 suckers per arm. If the hatchling manages to survive, the life cycle will be repeated.  Global distribution and habitat   Global distribution  M. maorum is commonly found in the waters of New Zealand and South Australia. preferring temperate to subarctic waters. In New Zealand they are found off the coasts of both the North and South islands. M. maorum is also common in the waters of the islands surrounding New Zealand including Campbell, Chatham and Auckland islands. In Southeast Tasmania, at Eaglehawk Bay the site of a commercial fishery is the only known inshore location where the M. maorum have been known to gather in large numbers year round.  Habitat  M. maorum lives in the benthic zone in soft-sediment and rubble habitats with depths of 0-549m and will sometimes forage in nearby hard-reef habitats and are less common at the fringes between reefal and soft sediment habitats. Rather than settling in a specific location, M. maorum uses temporary shelters. In Tasmania, young M. maorum have been observed settling in intertidal rock pools. Similar sightings of M. maorum in intertidal rock pools have been reported during the summer months in Kaikoura and Banks Peninsula. Diet/Prey/Predators Diet and Foraging A study of M. maorum off the coast of southeastern Tasmania found evidence of 12 different species in the stomachs of sampled octopuses with the dominant prey being the crab P. gaimardii and other M. maorum.Grubert, Mark A., Wadley, Vicki A., White, Robert W. G. (1999) Diet and feeding strategy of Octopus maorum in southeast Tasmania, Bulletin of Marine Science, 65(2), 441-451. University of Miami - Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science This is a low number of prey species compared to other species of octopus and it is assumed that the diet of M. maorum in Southeastern Tasmania is more diverse than results indicated in the study. M. Maorum will eat bivalves, crustaceans and fish but are selective and show preference to lobster, crabs and scallops. As is the case with other octopus species, M. maorum injects prey with a toxin that slowly liquefies flesh so that it can be more easily digested. Cannibalism is a common behavior for many species of octopus in the order of large eating small, however small M. maorum are known to attack larger octopus particularly Octopus tetricus where habitats overlap. M. maorum feeds mainly at night unless food is scarce in which case it must forage during the day. M. maorum is an extremely evolved hunter with a range of hunting methods including stalking, ambush, jet-propulsion and digging.Pack, Y. (1982) Masking behaviour and related biology of Notomithrax ursus (Oxyrhyncha: Majidae) (Doctoral Thesis, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand). Retrieved from http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/5947 When executing different hunting methods colour and texture are adjusted, often by darkening and erection of papillae. Prey such as crabs are pounced on using the speed of jet propulsion and prey is trapped under the octopus‚Äôs web in what is appropriately called the parachute position. Alternatively, in a situation where prey is nearby the octopus will simply snatch it with one of its tentacles. In the case of prey escaping and hiding M. maorum will persistently dig to uncover prey by pushing material into its web and dumping the removed material by the entrance to its home. Predators and parasites Macroctopus maorum is preyed upon by fur seals, sea lions, pilot whales, other octopus and the northern royal albatross. Penguins such as yellow-eyed, fiordland crested and little blue penguin might prey on Macroctopus maorum as well. M. maorum hosts dicyemid mesozoans and digenetic trematodes as parasites.Stranks, T. N. (1998). Systematics of the family Octopodidae (Mollusca:Cephalopoda) of South-Eastern Australia. (Masters Research thesis, Dept. of Zoology, The University of Melbourne) A more recent study of the species adds wobbegongs, school and gummy sharks, mulloway, queen snapper and dolphins to the list of predators.Shepard, S., & Edgar, G. (2013). Maori octopus Macroctopum maorum and pale octopus Octopus pallidus. In Ecology of Australian Temperate Reefs: The Unique South (pp. 138‚Äì130). Collingwood Australia: Csiro Publishing Sea slugs will often feed on M. maorum eggs. =Other information= While research was being carried out the behavior of M. maorum was monitored and results showed that while being in the aquarium they showed a variety of behaviors such as fighting, flamboyant postures and defensive up-turning of arms, withdrawing and cleaning. Small M. maorum would often take on larger octopuses such as O. tetricus such as a 300 g M. maorum fought and started to eat a 1 kg O. tetricus. M. maorum will generally reach a weight of up to 12 kg when fully grown. They live solitarily in a den for up to 3 months at a time. They would gather prey remains to form a midden (piles of shells, bones and rocks) the midden is used to conceal the entrance to their den. Sometimes mature M. maorum have been located in Eaglehawk Bay in Tasmania nobody knows why they aggregate here or where they come from. M. maorum has a significant economic effect on rock lobster fisheries in New Zealand and Southern Australia. M. maorum will prey on trapped southern rock lobster killing many and leaving some lobster missing limbs making them unsellable. This also means that M. maorum is being caught as bycatch. The South Australian rock lobster fisheries report that since 1983 octopus bycatch has ranged from 38,000 to 119,000 octopus a year. M. maorum are fished commercially in Eaglehawk Bay Tasmania where they congregate throughout the year in large numbers (as many as 70 octopuses). Eaglehawk Bay is the sole location where such a large inshore congregation is known to occur. M. maorum had been used as a model to determine the age of merobenthic, by using stylet increment analysis. SIA is a method which was developed recently to determine the age of an octopus, age is important for estimating the growth rate, population age structure, mortality rate, productivity and processes. Due to this understanding, it can be used to make important decisions surrounding fisheries and conservation management. Stylets are highly reduced internal shells that consist of a small rod- like structures, the result of SIA of showed that a stylet of M. maorum can be hard to prepare and age. However, SIA can only provide the relative age of the species, due to lack of knowledge surrounding the formation of the first stylet increment. Therefore, alternative methods of age determination of the octopus may need to be explored.

Through them, Otto Joachim was a grandfather of Carl L√∏venskiold and Harald L√∏venskiold, and a great-grandfather of Carl Axel L√∏venskiold and Carl Otto L√∏venskiold, Jr. Career L√∏venskiold took his secondary education in Skien, together with Anton Martin Schweigaard and Peter Andreas Munch. He finished school in 1828, then enrolled in higher education and took the cand.jur. degree in 1834. He worked as a junior solicitor, as secretary in the Supreme Court of Norway and as an audit in the Artillery Brigade. He was appointed as deputy under-secretary of state in the Ministry of Finance in 1847, and in 1854 he became an Assessor in the Supreme Court. He started his political career as Mayor of Kristiania, a position he held from 1869 to 1876. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway in 1871, representing the constituency of Kristiania, H√∏nefos og Kongsvinger. He was re-elected in 1874 and 1877. He stood for the election 1880, but failed as he did not receive enough votes in a primary election in 1879. L√∏venskiold's exit from national politics came as a hard blow to his career. He had rejected an offer to become Minister of Justice in the 1870s, citing his wish to conduct parliamentary work instead, and in 1877 he had rejected an offer to become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Norway for the same reason. In 1879 he received the dr.juris degree at the University of Copenhagen. In 1881 he became the praeses of the Royal Norwegian Society of Development. He was also chairman of the Norwegian Association of Hunters and Anglers, and a board member of Den norske H√•ndverks- og Industriforening and a member of Det skandinaviske Selskab. He died in August 1882 in Kristiania.

The contest was played by the National Football League (NFL)'s Miami Dolphins and New York JetsMiami Dolphins 28 at New York Jets 24 from Pro Football Reference that featured one of the most famous comeback plays in league history. Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino ran a trick play, pretending to stop the game clock but instead threw a pass that scored the game-winning touchdown, ultimately giving Miami the 28‚Äì24 victory. Summary The game itself pitted the 7‚Äì4 Dolphins against the 6‚Äì5 Jets; entering this game the Dolphins and Jets led the AFC East, but all five teams in the division were within two games of the division lead; the Bills had fallen to 6‚Äì6 following a Thanksgiving Day loss in Detroit while the Patriots had begun a late-season surge following victories over the Vikings and San Diego and were 5‚Äì6 facing the 5‚Äì6 Colts that same Sunday. The Jets were coming off a victory at Minnesota while the Dolphins had suffered back-to-back losses to Chicago and Pittsburgh. The Jets raced to a 17‚Äì0 lead before the Dolphins got on the board on Dan Marino's touchdown to Mark Ingram Sr., but misfired on a two-point conversion. The Jets scored again on Johnny Mitchell's touchdown catch before Marino found Ingram again, and this time, connected on another two-point conversion try, this one going to Irving Fryar. In the fourth, Boomer Esiason was intercepted for the first time; this set up a third Marino-to-Ingram score. The Dolphins blitzed Esiason and Tim Bowens forced a fumble recovered by the Jets; this forced a Jets punt, but O. J. McDuffie fumbled the punt to the Jets. The Jets drove to the Miami 38 with six minutes left but Esiason was intercepted again. The Jets forced another Miami punt, but with 2:34 left, J. B. Brown picked off Esiason again. Trailing 24‚Äì21 with 38 seconds left, the Dolphins had the ball at the Jets' 8-yard line with only one timeout. Running to the line of scrimmage, Marino nodded to Ingram and yelled \\"Clock! Clock! Clock!\\" and motioned that he was going to spike the ball to stop the clock. The Jets defense, anticipating a spike, relaxed. Marino took the snap; instead of spiking the ball, he dropped back to pass, while Ingram ran to the corner of the end zone with rookie Jets cornerback Aaron Glenn biting on the fake. With the Jets caught off-guard, Marino threw the pass to an open Ingram in the front-right corner of the end zone. The play was brought to Miami earlier in the year by backup quarterback Bernie Kosar, and Dolphins coach Don Shula decided it was the right time to use the trick play. The 28‚Äì24 victory moved the Dolphins to 8‚Äì4 and despite subsequent losses to Buffalo and Indianapolis the 10‚Äì6 Dolphins edged the 10‚Äì6 Patriots, who had won their last seven games, for the division title (winning on a season sweep of New England), the twelfth in the team's history. The Dolphins defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card Game 27-17, but lost in the Divisional Round to the San Diego Chargers, 22‚Äì21. The comeback was Marino's 29th in his career, and fifth against the Jets.\\"Dan Marino's Career 4th quarter comebacks and game-winning drives\\" Pro-Football-Reference.com Aftermath The Jets, meanwhile, went into a tailspin. Coach Pete Carroll called the loss \\"staggering.\\" It proved to be more than that. The loss set off the Jets' second straight December collapse; they would not win another game for the rest of the season. Carroll was fired after the season, but the Jets' slump continued under his successor, Rich Kotite; they would win only four games during Kotite's two seasons, including a franchise worst 1‚Äì15 record in 1996.

An innovative poet and well-known mystic, charismatic political leader and untiring reformist; Balkhi is undoubtedly the figurehead of modern Hazara history.bashgah.net  Life   Early life  Sayed Ismael Balkhi was born in 1918 into a Sayed family of sadat people in Balkhab district of Sar-e Pol province in Northern Afghanistan. He received early education in Afghanistan after which he traveled to Iraq for further studies in Islamic theology and jurisprudence. At the time when Balkhi left the country, the Afghan government did not provide enough opportunities to the Hazara people in order to get appropriate education in the country. Balkhi was a Shia by religion and thus associated with the greater Hazara community. Balkhi was introduced to reformist movements popular at that time in the Middle East. He imported these intellectual enhancements to this motherland and started preaching it with a zeal unmatched in a country haunted by social ignorance and political isolation.  Career  A religious activist, Bakhi was concerned during the liberal late 1940s period of Afghanistan, eventually becoming a political radical. In 1949, Balkhi plotted with at least five associates a coup d'etat against King Mohammad Zahir Shah (or, more specifically, an assassination attempt on Prime Minister Shah Mahmud Khan). The plan was foiled, and Balkhi spent some years in prison under the charges of conspiring to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic. The dynamism of Balkhi's personality is that he got his education in an environment (i.e. Iraq) where clerics were either turned into radical revolutionaries like Khomeini and Khamenei or into self-absorbed mystics or study oriented scholars. He was an exception among all such individuals. Ismael Balkhi was a mystic; he was heavily influenced by Mawlana Jalaluddin Balkhi but in the meantime, he was not unaware of his society. Similarly, Balkhi believed in political change but he never embraced any terrorist ideology or even internationalist approach. His patriotism and love for his country are evident in a number of poems he generated whilst in prison. Balkhi gave the Afghans a message of freedom and democracy. He preached individual liberty among fellow Hazaras. He taught his kinsmen the absolute necessity on obtaining as much knowledge as possible and approach free of Shia-oriented Syed racism that somewhat existed in Afghanistan. He might have had personality flaws like all other individuals of history but he surely is one of the flag-bearers of liberty, peace and unity in Afghanistan.

A building constructed in this way is required to meet certain measurable or predictable performance requirements, such as energy efficiency or seismic load, without a specific prescribed method by which to attain those requirements. This is in contrast to traditional prescribed building codes, which mandate specific construction practises, such as stud size and distance between studs in wooden frame construction. Such an approach provides the freedom to develop tools and methods to evaluate the entire life cycle of the building process, from the business dealings, to procurement, through construction and the evaluation of results. Background One of the first implementations of performance-based building design requirements was in Hammurabi's Code (c. 1795 to 1750 BC), where is stated that ‚Äúa house should not collapse and kill anybody‚Äù. This concept is also described in Vitruvius‚Äôs ‚ÄúDe architectura libri decem‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Ten Books of Architecture‚Äù) in first century BC.In modern times, the first definition of performance-based building design was introduced in 1965 in France by Blach√®re with the Agr√©ment system http://www.cstb.fr/CSTB Despite this, the building process remained relatively conventional for the next 50 years, based solely on experience and codes, regulations prescribed by law which stifled innovations and change. The prescription approach is a technical procedure based on past experience which consists of comparing the proposed design with standardized codes, so no simulation or verification tools are needed for the design and building process. A new approach began to emerge during the second half of the 20th century, when many local building markets began to show that they needed greater flexibility in the procurement procedures to facilitate the exchange of building goods between countries and to improve the speed of procedures and innovations in the building process. This innovative approach to the procurement, design, contracting, management and maintenance of buildings was performance-based building design (PBBD). Most recently the clearest definition of performance based building approach was explained in 1982 by the CIB W60 Commission in the report n.64, where Gibson stated that ‚Äúfirst and foremost, the performance approach is [...] the practice of thinking and working in terms of ends rather than means.[ ‚Ä¶] It is concerned with what a building or building product is required to do, and not with prescribing how it is to be constructed‚Äù.http://www.cibworld.nl Many research establishments have studied the implementation of PBBD during the last fifty years.Foster 1972ASTM/CIB/RILEM 1982CSTB 1988Davis and Ventre 1990Becker and Paciuk 1996CIB 2001Huovila 2005 A majority of areas of building design remain open to innovation. During 1998-2001, the CIB Board and Programme Committee initiated the Proactive Programme on Performance-Based BuildingFoliente et al. 1998Foliente 1998 in order to practically implement technical developments of performance-based building. This programme was followed by the establishment of the Performance-Based Building http://www.pebbu.nl (PeBBu), running from October 2001 to October 2005, thanks to funds from the European Commission (EC) Fifth Framework Programme. The PeBBu Network had a broad and varied programme, a set of activities and produced many papers to aid in the implementation of such vision. PeBBu Thematic Network PeBBu Thematic Network was managed by the CIB General Secretariat (International Council for Research and Innovation in Building Construction), particularly by the CIB Development Foundation (CIBdf). The PeBBu Network started working in 2001 and completed in 2005. In the PeBBu Network 73 organisations, included CIBdf (coordinating contractor), BBRI (Belgium), VTT (Finland), CSTB (France), EGM (Netherlands), TNO (Netherlands), BRE (UK), cooperated to this project bringing people together to share their work, their information and knowledge. The objectives of the Network was to stimulate and facilitate international dissemination and implementation of Performance Based Building in building and construction sector, maximising the contribution to this by the international Research and Development community. The PeBBu Thematic Network result is described and explained in 26 final reports which included three reports with an overall PBB scope, a multitude of research reports from the PeBBu Domains, User Platforms and Regional Platforms, a Final Management report and four practice reports for providing practical support to the actual application of PBB concept in building and construction sector. PBB: Conceptual framework A conceptual framework for implementing a PBB market was identified while reviewing various viewpoints during the compilation of the 2nd International State of the Art Report for the PeBBu Thematic Network (Becker and Foliente 2005). The building facility is a multi-component system with a generally very long life cycle. The system's design agenda as a whole, and the more specific design objectives of its parts, originate from relevant user requirements. These requirements evolve into a comprehensive set of Performance Requirements that should be established by a large number of stakeholders (the users, entrepreneur/owner, regulatory framework, design team, and manufacturers). The main steps in a Performance Based Building Design process are *# identifying and formulating the relevant User Requirements, *# transforming the User Requirements identified into Performance Requirements and quantitative performance criteria, *# using reliable design and evaluation tools to assess whether proposed solutions meet the stated criteria at a satisfactory level. Performance concept In a Performance-based approach, the focus of all decisions, is on the required performance-in-use and on the evaluations and testing of building asset. Performance Based Building (PBB) is focused on performance required in use for the business processes and the needs of the users, and then on the evaluations and verification of building assets result. The Performance approach can be used whether the process is about an existing or new assets. It is applicable to the procurement of constructed assets and to any phase of the whole life cycle Building Process, such as strategic planning, asset management, briefing/programming, design and construction, operation and maintenance, management and use, renovations and alterations, codes, regulations and standards. It includes many topics and criteria, which can be categorized as physical, functional, environmental, financial, economical, psychological, social, facilities, and other more. These criteria are related to singular project, according to the context and the situation. Two key characteristics of performance concept Performance concept is based on two key characteristics : * the use of two languages, one for the clients/users requirements and the other for the supply of the performance; * the need for validation and verification of results against performance targets. =Two languages= The Performance concept requires two languages: the language of demand requirements and the language of the required performance which should have a capability to fulfill the demand. It is important to recognize that these languages are different. Szigeti and Davis (Performance Based Building: Conceptual Framework, 2005) explain that ‚Äúthe dialog between client and supplier can be described as two halves of a ‚Äúhamburger bun‚Äù, with the statement of the requirement in functional or performance language (FC - functional concept) matched to a solution (SC - solution concept) in more technical language, and the matching, verification / validation that needs to occur in between‚Äù. In a recent paper Ang, Groosman, and Scholten (2005) explain that the functional concept represents the set of unquantified objectives and scopes to be satisfied by the supply solutions, related to performance requirements. The solution concept represents technical realization that satisfies at least the required performance. Design decision is a development of a solution concept. =Assessing result ‚Äì match and compare= Building performance evaluation is the process of systematically comparing and matching the performance in use of building assets with explicitly documented or implicitly criteria for their expected performance. In the PBB approach is essential matching and comparing demand and supply. It can be done by using a validation method, by measurement, calculation, or testing. Tools and methods are used to permit some form of measurement of testing of the requirements, and the relating measurement of the capability of assets to perform. There are many types of in-depth specialized technical evaluations and audits. These validations generally require time, a major effort by the customer group, and a high level of funding. Normally, the most valuable methods and tools are comprehensive scans which are performance based and include metrics that can easily be measured without lab-type instruments. Evaluations and reviews, are integral part of asset and portfolio management, design, construction, commissioning. Evaluations can be used for different purposes, depending on the requirements being considered, for example they could be used in support of funding decisions, they could include a condition assessment to ensure that the level of degradation or the obsolescence is known, they could include an assessment of the utilization or an assessment of the capability of the product result to perform functional expected requirements. Such evaluations can be used at any time during the life cycle of the asset. PBB evaluations should be done in a routine manner, really the evaluations are often done only as part of Commissioning or shortly thereafter, or when there is a problem. There are two different kinds of performance verifications. Performance evaluations rate the physical asset according to a set of existing criteria and indicators of capability, and match the results against the required levels of performance. The Occupant Satisfaction Surveys record the perceptions of the users, usually through a scale of satisfaction measurements. Both types of evaluations complement each other. * Tools Innovative decision-support methodologies are taking place in building sector. There are some tools explicitly based on the demand and supply concepts and other ones which employ standardized performance metrics that for the first time link facility condition to the functional requirements of organizations and their customers. Projects can be planned, prioritize, and budgeted using a multi-criteria approach, that is transparent, comprehensive and auditable. One of the methodologies that can be used is a gap analysis based on calibrated scales that measure both the levels of requirements and the capability of the asset that is either already used, or being designed, or offer to be bought, or leased. Such methodology is an ASTM and American National (ANSI) standard and is currently being considered as an ISO standard. It is particularly useful when the information about the ‚Äúgap‚Äù, if any, can be presented in support of funding decisions and actions. There are a large number of verification methodologies, (e.g. POEs, CRE-FM), and all of these need to refer back to explicit statements of requirements to be able to compare with expected performance. To evaluate the result of a building asset against the expected performance requirements it is necessary to fix some tools used during the process. These tools are the reference of whole life cycle building process, so organizations use ‚Äòkey performance indicators (KPI)‚Äô to prove that they are meeting the targets that have been set by senior management. At the same time performance measurement (PM) becomes central to managing organizations, their operations and logistic support. These methodologies include the feedback loop that links a facility in use to the requirements and capabilities that are compared and matched whenever decisions are needed. Performance approach and prescriptive approach A prescriptive approach describes the way a building asset must be constructed, rather than the end result of the building process, and is related to the type and quality of materials used, the method of construction, and the workmanship, etc. This type of approach is strictly mandated by a combination of law, codes, standards, and regulations, etc., and is based on past experience and consolidated know-how. The content of prescriptive codes and standards is usually a consequence of an accident causing injury or death which requires a remedy to avoid a repeat, as a consequence of some hazardous situation, or as a consequence of some recognized social need. In many countries, in both the public and private sector, research is taking place into a different set of codes, methods and tools based on performance criteria to complement the traditional prescriptive codes. In the 1970s, this search produced the ‚ÄúNordic Model‚Äù (NKB 1978), which constituted the reference model of next performance-based codes. This model links easily to one of the key characteristics of the Performance approach, the dialog between the WHY, the WHAT and the HOW. Using a Performance Based approach does not preclude the use of prescriptive specifications. Although the benefits of the adopting of a PBBD approach are significant, it is recognized that employing a performance- based approach at any stage in the building process is more complex and expensive than using the simpler prescriptive route. So, the application of this approach should not be regarded as an end in itself. When simple building are concerned or well proven technologies are used, the use of prescriptive codes results more effective, efficient, faster, or less costly, so prescriptive specifications will continue to be useful in many situations. At the same time for the complex projects use of the performance based route at every stage is indispensable, in particular during design and evaluation phases. It is not likely that a facility will be planned, procured, delivered, maintained, used and renovated using solely Performance Based documents at each step of the way, down the supply chain, to the procurement of products and materials, because there is not yet enough experience with the Performance Based Building approach. At the same time the prescriptive approach can bring to stifle changes and innovations, so best way to set building process is blending both different approaches. Statements of Requirements (SoR) The Statements of Requirements represents a reference for the whole life cycle management of facilities, they are the core of the conceptual framework came up from the PeBBu Thematic Network. They constitute the key to implementation of the PBB in the construction sector. The SoRs is a document prepared by clients, or in the verbal statements communicated to supplies, it is based on the user functional needs. These user requirements are converted into performance requirements, which can be explicit or implicit. Such document should include information about what is essential to the client. SoRs will take different forms depending on the kind of client and what is being procured, at what phase of the Life Cycle or where in the supply chain a document is being used. The SoRs should be, dynamic, not static, and should include more and more details as projects proceed. This document should be prepared at different levels of granularity, how detailed the documentation is at each stage depends on the complexity of the project and on the procurement route chosen for the project. The SoRs represent a very important part of a continuous process of communication between clients (demand) and their project team (supply), they will be updated and managed using computerized tools and will contain all requirements throughout the life of the facility. This process is called ‚Äúbriefing‚Äù in UK and Commonwealth English, and ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù in American English. An SoR is normally prepared for any project, whether it is a PBB project or not. Assembling such a document usually leads to a more appropriate match between the needs of clients and users and the constructed assets. Statements of Requirements have to be very carefully stated so that it is easy to verify that a proposed solution can meet those requirements. High level statement of requirements need to be paired with indicators of capability so design solutions can be evaluated before they are built in order to avoid mistakes. In the SoRs it is important to take into account some design aspect like flexibility indicators because constructed assets need for change during their life cycle, uses and activities can change very rapidly, so it is essential to test different solutions way that the spaces might be used according to anticipate changes. SoRs, as understood in ISO 9000, include not only what the client requires and is prepared to pay for, but also the process and indicators that will provide the means to verify, and validate, that the product or service delivered meets those stated requirements. As part of the worldwide movement to implement a PBB approach and to develop tools that will make it easier to shift to PBB, the International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI) set up projects to map the processes that are part of Whole Life Cycle Management as Portfolio and Asset Management: Performance (PAMPeR) and Early Design‚Äù (ED). The IAI efforts are complemented by many other efforts to create standards for the information to be captured and analyzed to verify performance-in-use. Performance requirements (PR) Performance requirements translate user requirements in more precise quantitative measurable and technical terms, usually for a specific purpose. Supply team prepares a document that includes, objectives and goals, performance requirements and criteria. It is important to include ‚Äúindicators of performance‚Äù in the way that it can be measured the results against explicit requirements, whether qualitative or quantitative. Performance indicators need to be easily understood by the users and the evaluators. To validate the indicators and verify that required performance-in-use has been achieved it is necessary using appropriate methods and tools. Levels of performance requirements can be stated as part of the preparation of SoRs, as part of project programs, or as part of requests for proposals and procurement contracts. It is preferable adopting a flexible approach to the expression and comparison of performance levels, so required and achieved performance can be expressed not as single values but as bands between upper and lower limits. In consequence, in performance terms the criteria can be expressed as graduated scales, divided into broad bands. Performance based codes In the building and construction industry, until 25‚Äì30 years old, prescriptive codes, regulations and standards made innovation and change difficult and costly to implement, and created technical restrictions to trade. These concerns have been the major drivers towards the use of a Performance Based approach to codes, regulations and standards. Performance-based building regulations have been implemented or are being developed in many countries but they have not yet reached their full potential. In part, this can be attributed to the fact that the overall regulatory system has not yet been fully addressed, and gaps exist in several key areas. Bringing the regulatory and non-regulatory models together is probably the best way to work. This is shown in the ‚ÄúTotal Performance System Models‚Äù diagram (Meacham, et al. 2002), that maps the flow of decision making from society and business objectives to construction solutions. The difference between the regulatory and non-regulatory parts of the Total Performance System Models is that the first one is mandated by codes and regulations based on the law, while those other functional requirements, included in Statements of Requirements, are an integral part of what the client requires and is willing to pay for. * Consequences relating to procedure For procurements in the public sector and for publicly traded corporations, it's important that the decisions and choices are transparent and explicit, regardless of the specific procurement route. All procurement processes can be either Prescriptive or Performance Based. Design-Build, Public Private Partnerships (PPP), private finance initiative (PFI) and similar procurement procedures are particularly suited to the use of a strong Performance Based Building application. If the expected performance are not stated explicitly and verifiably then these procurement methods will likely be more subject to disappointments and legal problems. To get the benefits from these procurement approaches, it is essential to organize the services of the supply chain in order to get innovative, less costly, or better solutions by shifting decisions about ‚Äúhow‚Äù to the integrated team. Future scenarios Although the effort of a large number of research establishments in order to implement and diffuse the PBBD approach, it is difficult to innovate the practice of working and thinking in building sector. The positive trend is that more and more interest in this approach is happening around the world. Many countries tried to reform the way that building and construction is regulated and managed. The core of implementation of PBB approach is that the clients, the users really know and understand why and what they require and that they can state easily and clearly their SoRs document. It is also important that the client is active, involved, informed and able to understand and choose best way for its interest, whether he's a private or a public client, a big or a little structure, whether the asset is for its own use or for use by others. Procurement will be the key to improve performance approach when clients learn to be more explicit in their demands and to participate more aggressively in the management and delivery process of their most significant investment and resource.

After more than a decade of roles with the Covent Garden Opera Company, with other companies and on the concert stage, Shacklock performed for six years in The Sound of Music in London as the Mother Abbess. She taught singing at the Royal Academy of Music from 1968 to 1978. Life and career Shacklock was born in Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, and trained at the Royal Academy of Music. Her career took off after she was recruited in 1946 to the new Covent Garden Opera Company. Her first Covent Garden appearance was in Purcell's masque The Fairy- Queen. She remained with the company for a decade, beginning with small roles such as Mercedes in Carmen and moving up to leading parts including Carmen, Octavian (Der Rosenkavalier), Marina (Boris Godunov), Magdalene (Die Meistersinger), and Mrs Sedley (Peter Grimes). In 1948 she was cast as Brangane in Tristan and Isolde alongside the celebrated Norwegian soprano, Kirsten Flagstad. In 1953 she shared the title role of Britten's Gloriana with Joan Cross. Away from Covent Garden, Shacklock appeared in opera in Berlin with Erich Kleiber, and sang in oratorio, notably as the angel in The Dream of Gerontius with Sir John Barbirolli. She was also a regular at Last Night of the Proms with Sir Malcolm Sargent, celebrated for her singing of \\"Rule, Britannia!\\"The Times, 21 September 1953, p. 10; 20 September 1954, p. 9; 17 September 1956, p. 3; 16 September 1957, p. 3; and 19 September 1960, p. 4 She also performed in Argentina as Octavian in Der Rosenkavalier, with Birgit Nilsson as the Marschallin. In 1961, Shacklock left the operatic stage and joined the cast of The Sound of Music for an unexpected six-year run as the Mother Abbess at the Palace Theatre, London.The show closed in January 1967: see The Times, 5 January 1967, p. 4 She retired from performing, and taught singing at the Royal Academy of Music from 1968 to 1978. Notable students included the British opera singers Kathryn Harries and Victoria Burmester. Shacklock was awarded the OBE in 1971 and became president of the Association of Teachers of Singing in 1995. While teaching at the Royal Academy of Music she became close friends with a young mezzo-soprano from Birmingham called Jean Tredaway, whom she subsequently adopted. Jean Tredaway, who died in 2006, was born in 1935, the youngest of eight children of Robert H. Tredaway and May Trueman. Shacklock married organist Eric George Mitchell in 1947 (died 1965). She died in London in 1999. A vast archive of personal documents once belonging to her was discovered in a Midlands property and was auctioned on 18 August 2010 in Lichfield. The eponymous Constance Close in Kingston Vale, Surrey, was created on the site of her residence in her memory.

The common usage of the word denotes the cell that holds the primary mirror (M1), however technically it could also be used to denote the support assembly (usually called a spider or strut) for the secondary mirror (M2) or other mirrors. Overview Basic cells A basic mirror cell can be built using minimal calculation and simple materials. Only slightly more complex are the wooden, plastic or metal cells which are often glued and which are either not user adjustable or which have only limited adjustment and which are used in lower end commercial telescopes and smaller amateur-built telescopes. Cells for more sophisticated \\"small\\" telescopes Telescope makers seeking to build larger \\"small\\" telescopes with thinner mirrors find simple designs inadequate so they must resort to more complex design methods which include possible use of multiaxis adjustment potential and floating whiffletree Grubb 15 inch support cell built in 1835 cell design, often optimimized using computer aided design programs. There remains a good deal of discussion in the amateur telescope making community over the use of glue and the addition of simple astatic devices in such cells. Actuators of the active optics in the mirror support cell of the Gran Telescopio Canarias. Cells for large telescopes Astronomical observatories require a much heavier and more complex mirror support cell. One notable example of the structure needed for such telescopes is the dual cell for the M1 mirrors of the 8.4 meter Large Binocular Telescope at Mount Graham International Observatory. This is a multiple beam and truss system which in turn supports a temperature maintenance and air flow system, six position actuators and the 160 pneumatic actuators which work its active optics system. This results in a huge assembly structure weighing about 28 tons without its mirrors. Such a mirror cell requires multiple mathematical steps of finite element analysis of its deformation under static and moving loading. See also * Amateur Telescope Making - book series by Albert G.

The lenses were sold under the name Nikkor. The mount was a copy of the Zeiss Ikon Contax rangefinder mount, however, small differences between the two mean that although Zeiss wide-angle lenses can be used on the Nikon cameras and vice versa, the longer lenses (50 mm and above), if used, will not be able to focus at both close range and infinity. Nikon made a small number of longer focal length lenses specifically designed to focus properly when mounted on a Contax. These were the 85mm, 105mm, and 135mm lenses. Each was marked with a \\"C\\" on the side of the lens barrel. This is not to be confused with a \\"C\\" mark used as a suffix to the serial number. Some early Nikkors used this mark to denote that the lenses were coated. The mount itself has two bayonets, one inside the camera and another outside. Lenses that use the bayonet inside the camera need have no focusing helicoid built into the lens barrel. As a consequence, the 5 cm f/1.4 lens that was normally sold with the body is extremely small (about the size of a golf ball) since the lens contains the optics only. Focusing of such lenses could be done by rotating the toothed wheel on the top front of the camera body or by rotating the lens barrel itself (the distance scale is on the camera body). The external bayonet is used to mount longer and heavier lenses where the built-in helicoid would not be strong enough to rotate the lens barrel. Such lenses are focused using a focusing ring and distance scale on the lens just like typical SLR lenses (the distance scale on the camera body will be covered by the lens flange and thus not visible). Nikon produced a very large range of Nikkor lenses for these cameras with focal lengths from 21mm to 1000mm. Several other manufacturers including Fuji (now Fujifilm), Komura and Zunow made S-mount lenses at the time of which the Zunow 5 cm f/1.1 lens is a keenly sought after collectors item. In 2002, Cosina Voigtl√§nder manufactured a camera (the Bessa R2S) as well as several lenses for the Nikon S-mount.

His standing in the profession was largely the result of his textbooks of ophthalmology which were widely used in his home country and abroad. His working career was spent at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and when he retired from clinical practice in 1905 he became involved in medical and national politics. He was surgeon-oculist in Scotland to King George V and then to King Edward VII and was president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh from 1910‚Äì1912. He was knighted in 1916. At the 1922 general election he was elected as Member of Parliament for the Combined Scottish Universities , sitting as a Scottish Unionist. He held the seat until he stood down at the 1931 general election.  Early life  Berry was born in Leith in 1853.

On return to Edinburgh he was uncertain as to a choice of career and enrolled at first in mathematics classes at the University of Edinburgh. He showed a considerable aptitude for mathematics and became one of only six members of the senior mathematics class of Professor Peter Tait, the professor of natural philosophy. Having decided on a career in medicine he matriculated in the University of Edinburgh Medical School. graduating MB CM in 1876  Clinical career  He decided at an early stage to pursue a career in ophthalmology. He was resident house surgeon in Moorfields Eye Hospital in London in 1878-79 and at this very early stage of his career he was an enthusiastic supporter of the formation of the Ophthalmological Society of the United Kingdom which was established in 1880. He was a founder member. In 1881 he became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (FRCSEd). He spent some time attending various specialist ophthalmology clinics in continental Europe. In Copenhagen he attended the clinic of his uncle Professor Edmund Hansen Grut and studied under Jannik Bjerrum. He held his uncle in high regard and later dedicated to him the second edition (1893) of his highly successful textbook Diseases of the Eye- a Practical Treatise for Students of Ophthalmology. By training in Copenhagen he established a link between ophthalmology in Copenhagen and Edinburgh and set a precedent which would later be followed by Arthur H H Sinclair and Harry Moss Traquair. Berry also studied ophthalmology in France, Germany, Austria and Holland. These European travels served to improve his skills as a linguist and at a relatively young age he became recognised in European countries as an authority on diseases of the eye. He was appointed to the staff of the Ophthalmology Department of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) in 1882. Berry remained on the staff for 23 years becoming senior surgeon, a post from which he retired in 1905. For the same period he held the appointment of lecturer in ophthalmology at the University of Edinburgh. His reputation as an ophthalmologist extended throughout Europe and the USA largely as a result of the success of Diseases of the Eye- a Practical Treatise for Students of Ophthalmology which became a widely read textbook . The first (1889) and the second (1893) editions were both published in the United Kingdom and in the USA. Its success was because it was widely considered to be a comprehensive account of the state of knowledge of the speciality and also because of the many original observations which it contained. In addition he published two monographs which were widely acclaimed and used, Subjective symptoms in Eye Disease (1886)Berry, G. A. (1886). Subjective Symptoms in Eye Diseases, etc. Edinburgh: Oliver & Boyd. and The Elements of Ophthalmoscope diagnosis (1891).Berry, G. A. (1891).

In 1922 he was elected Member of Parliament MP for the Combined Scottish Universities and held this seat until he stood down at the 1931 election.  Honours and awards  In 1886, at an early stage in his career, Berry was awarded the prestigious Middlemore prize by the British Medical Association (BMA). He went on to become president of the section of ophthalmology of the BMA in 1905. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.in 1883.

It had a population of 19297. At one of the highest elevations above sea level in Jordan, this municipality is famous for apple and fruit farms. The Crusader castle Montreal is located in Shoubak. History The Crusader castle Montr√©al in Shoubak. Shoubak was first settled by the Edomites who had their capital in Busaira in neighboring Tafilah Governorate. It was then settled by the Nabataeans. Shoubak became a Nahia in 1894, and was administratively belonging to the then-Ottoman Kerak department. In 1973, it was ranked up to a Qadaa. In the 31st Administrative Divisions System of 1995, Shoubak became a full department within Ma'an Governorate benefiting from the decentralization program. Shoubak is known for its Crusader castle Montreal. Along with Petra and Aqaba, Shoubak forms the third head of this triangle that lies on the cross road between Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Its unique high elevation (1330 m above sea level) gave it a strategic importance. The importance of Shoubak reached its peak after Baldwin I of Jerusalem took control of it, cutting the roots between Egypt and Syria, the Montreal castle was built on top of a hill there in 1115. Shoubak was then annexed to the Ayyubid dynasty by Saladin in 1187. During the Arab Revolt, T.E. Lawrence entered Shoubak in Feb. 1918, commenting, \\"We went over the ridge and down to the base of the shapely cone, whose mural crown was the ring-wall of the old castle of Monreale, very noble against the night sky.\\" Upon departure, he wrote, \\"...we skated timorously down the rapid path to the open plain across which still stretched the Roman road with its groups of fallen milestones, inscribed by famous emperors.\\" Geography Shoubak is known for its cold winters. Shoubak is located at an area bordering Tafilah Governorate to the north and Aqaba Governorate to the west. It is administratively in Ma'an Governorate. Due to its high elevation, Shoubak is famous for its cold freezing winters, and due to its location at the borders of the Arabian Desert, it has a dry summer season. Climate In Shoubak, there is a Warm-summer Mediterranean climate. Most rain falls in the winter. The K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification is Csb, but very close to Dsa and BSk. The average annual temperature in Shoubak is . About of precipitation falls annually. Demographics The national census of the year 2004 showed that the total population of Shoubak was 12,590 persons, of whom 5,666 are males (45%) and 6924 are females, constituting 55% of the total population. There were 1,663 households with an average of 5 persons/household. Almost the entire population are Muslims. Economy View from the Montreal castle. Agriculture forms the major source of income for Shoubak, followed by tourism. Benefiting from its high altitude of more than 1,300 m above sea level, the countryside of Shoubak extends to about 189 km2 of olive, vegetable and fruit farms, mainly apple farms surrounding and within the town of Shoubak, resulting in the city spanning a relatively large area. There are 129 honey bee farms in the town's countryside, making it a major producer of honey.Shoubak Municipality Education The college of agriculture of Al- Balqa\` Applied University is located in Shoubak.

The E-4/20 was the first four-engine, all-metal stressed skin heavier-than-air airliner built. Design and development At a time when most aircraft were small, single- engine biplanes made of wood and canvas, the E-4 was a large (102-foot wingspan), all-metal, four-engine, stress-skinned, semi-monocoque, cantilevered-wing monoplane, with an enclosed cockpit, and accommodation for 18 passengers plus a crew of five, including two pilots, a radio operator, an engineer and a steward, as well as radio-telegraph communications, a toilet, a galley and separate baggage and mail storage. With a maximum speed of 143 mph, cruising speed of , a range of about , and a fully loaded weight of , it outperformed most other airliners of its day. The E-4 included numerous innovations, including its all-metal monocoque construction, onboard facilities such as lavatory, kitchen and radio communications, and its notable and sturdy monoplane load-bearing box-girder wing constructed of dural metal which formed both the wing's main girder and the structure of the wing itself. Skinned with thin sheets of dural metal to give the aerofoil shape necessary for a wing, the girder section wing had fabric covered leading and trailing edges attached to it. This superb and innovative wing was robust and self- supporting. The E-4 was completed in 1919 and test flown between 30 September 1920 and 1922 when it was broken up on the orders of the Inter-Allied Commission. Background The Zeppelin-Staaken E-4/20 was a product of the innovative Zeppelin Airship company. Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, founder of the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH (Zeppelin Airship Construction Co.) was himself a major aeronautical innovator, creator of the groundbreaking giant aluminium alloy framed Zeppelin lighter than air dirigible airships and later developer of a series of R-Planes. Zeppelin was one of the first aeronautical pioneers to apply stringent scientific principals to the design of aircraft, focusing on issues like power-to-weight ratios of engines and using the then new metal alloy aluminium for structural components. Zeppelin heard of the success in Russia of Igor Sikorsky's pioneering 4-engined Le Grand and Ilya Muromets aircraft. From the outbreak of war in 1914 the 4-engined Ilya Muromets class of aircraft were used as heavy bombers. The German government saw the potential for large strategic bombers and issued a design standard which was used by several manufacturers to produce Riesenflugzeuge (\\"Giant Aircraft\\") or R-Planes. The most successful design and manufacturing company of R-Planes was Zeppelin which was also the only company to manufacture them in series production, the R-VI. Legacy Adolf Rohrbach went on to found his own aircraft company, Rohrbach Metall-Flugzeugbau where he designed and built a number of innovative civil all-metal airliners, such as the Ro-VIII trimotor as well as some groundbreaking flying boats. The Smithsonian Institution's \\"Airspace Magazine\\" suggested that Rohrbach could have been Germany's Boeing or Douglas but that the Inter-Allied Commission deemed the E-4/20 too much of a threat as a potential bomber to be allowed to go into serial production and ordered its destruction, even declining offers to sell it to allied countries. The 1932 Armstrong Whitworth Atalanta used a very similar configuration, differing in construction details and more powerful engines.

Corso Buenos Aires is a major street in north-eastern Milan, Italy. With over 350 shops and outlets, it features the highest concentration of clothing stores in Europe.Milan attractions: Corso Buenos Aires The architecture of the area is mostly late 19th- and 20th-century style; the street and its surroundings are pointed with several neo-classical and art nouveau buildings. Location Corso Buenos Aires is located in the north-eastern part of Milan, corresponding to the Zone 3 administrative division. It is about 1.2 km long, going roughly south-west to north-east, along the ideal line connecting Milan's centre at the Duomo to the nearby city of Monza. The street itself starts at Piazzale Oberdan, in the Porta Venezia neighbourhood, and ends in Piazzale Loreto. Going towards the city centre, the prosecution of Corso Buenos Aires is Corso Venezia, that reaches the very centre at Piazza San Babila, in the immediate surroundings of the Duomo. From the opposite end in Piazzale Loreto, three distinct streets depart, the main of which is Viale Monza, connecting Milan to Monza. The Milan Metro subway (Line 1) has three stops along Buenos Aires (in Porta Venezia, Piazza Lima, and Piazzale Loreto). Shopping Due to the large number of shops, stores, and outlets, Corso Buenos Aires is one of the busiest streets of Milan; even more so during the Christmas holidays, when it sells most of the city's decorations.Corso Buenos Aires at TripWiser Unlike Via Montenapoleone and the surroundings of Piazza Duomo, that are specialized in high fashion and haute couture products, Corso Buenos Aires is generally more oriented towards mass products such as ready-to-wear type clothes. History Beginning of Corso Buenos Aires from Piazza Oberdan, 1957 The modern Corso Buenos Aires developed from the \\"stradone di Loreto\\", an old road connecting the centre of Milan to Monza.Il cielo di Loreto (in italian) In the 19th century, the road used to be called \\"Corso Loreto\\"; one of its prominent features was the Lazaretto, which is also mentioned in Alessandro Manzoni's novel The Betrothed; it was demolished in the late 19th century. Approximately in the same period, the horsecars that served this route were replaced by trams. In 1964 the trams themselves were abolished and the railway dismantled, being replaced by the modern subway line. Corso Buenos Aires used to be known for the numerous small shops selling traditional Milanese products; however, these have been mostly replaced by modern fashion outlets. Likewise, some of the ancient buildings were replaced by modern, high-rise blocks of flats.

Early Science and Medicine, Vol. 4, No. 1 (1999), pp. 1‚Äì36. (Reference to Li Yingshi is on p. 17) He was converted to Catholicism by Matteo Ricci and Diego de Pantoja, the first two Jesuits to establish themselves in Beijing. He then became a zealous Christian.  Early life  Li Yingshi was a member of the Chinese literati class. He commanded a unit of 500 soldiers during the Korean War of 1592‚Äì98.Gallagher (trans) (1953), pp. 433‚Äì437 He was awarded a lifetime pension by the Wanli government, which was to continue to be paid to his heirs in perpetuity. During peacetime, he studied astrology and geomancy.  Conversion  In the meantime, in 1601 the Jesuits Matteo Ricci and Diego de Pantoja became the first Christian missionaries to be settled in the Ming capital. They appreciated Confucian learning and wanted to establish good relations with the Chinese literati,Gallagher (trans.) (1953), pp. 93‚Äì98 but strongly disparaged the \\"ridiculous wizardry\\" of Chinese occult practices.Gallagher (trans.) (1953), pp. 82‚Äì85, 90‚Äì92. This is why, perhaps, Ricci described the Jesuits' conversion of Li Yingshi to Christianity ‚Äì which was accomplished on the Feast of St Matthew (i.e., September 21) of 1602 ‚Äì as nothing less than \\"extraordinary\\". Once Li became a Christian, it took him, Ricci, and de Pantoja three days to go through his \\"beautiful and well stocked library\\" to identify all books and manuscripts \\"forbidden by ecclesiastical regulations\\". The forbidden books and manuscripts, mostly dealing with the \\"art of divination\\" were then burned, some at Li's own courtyard and others at the Beijing Mission House, to demonstrate Li's commitment to Christianity. This apparently was not an uncommon practice in Ricci's day: when another celebrated convert, the mathematician Ignatius Qu Taisu (ÁûøÂ§™Á¥†; Chiutaiso in Ricci's transcription) became Christian, he also sent his library of books on \\"the dogma of the sects\\" to the Nanjing Mission House to be burned, along with book printing plates and non-Christian religious statues.Gallagher (trans). (1953), p. 468 Li Yingshi became a zealous member of the Catholic church. He proselytized among his friends and relatives, and got all his servants to join the church as well. He had a chapel built at his home and had his son study at the Beijing Mission House, so that soon enough the young Li was able to celebrate Mass himself. As a person highly knowledgeable about the \\"sect of idol worshippers\\",Although Ricci is aware about the difference between Chinese Buddhism and Taoism, he does not specify explicitly what religion Li had been an adherent of before his conversion Li was able to supply the Jesuits with a large amount of information that they found helpful in converting other non- Christians.

A systematic name for this compound is 2-aminohexanoic acid.The use of the name norleucine is discouraged as it is a misnomer, given than nor is defined for an amino acid with one less methylene group than found in the proteinogenic form. The compound is an isomer of the more common amino acid leucine. Like most other Œ±-amino acids, norleucine is chiral. It is a white, water-soluble solid. Occurrence Together with norvaline, norleucine is found in small amounts in some bacterial strains where its concentration can approach millimolar. Its biosynthesis has been examined. It arises via the action of 2-isopropylmalate synthase on Œ±-ketobutyrate. The incorporation of Nle into peptides reflects the imperfect selectivity of the associated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. In Miller‚ÄìUrey experiments probing prebiotic synthesis of amino acids, norleucine and especially norvaline are formed.Alvarez-Carreno, Claudia; Becerra, Arturo; Lazcano, Antonio \\"Norvaline and Norleucine May Have Been More Abundant Protein Components during Early Stages of Cell Evolution\\" Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres 2014, volume 43, 363-375.

World of Antiques & Art, The, No. 77, Aug 2009 - Feb 2010: 10. Architectural photographer After advertising and fashion photography, Gollings settled on architectural photography, in which he has since worked in the Asia Pacific region. In 1973 and inspired by Learning from Las Vegas, Gollings arrived in Surfers Paradise (a well known holiday destination) from Melbourne, with the intention to extensively photograph the town's architecture, signs and symbols of leisure. 40 years later, building on field work in collaboration with Melbourne architect Tony Styant-Browne, urban planner Mal Horner and graphic designer Julie Jame, he undertook a project to re-photograph the city from exactly the same viewpoints. In the mid-seventies he travelled to Los Angeles to shoot a new portfolio featuring modern architecture and in 1976 he received private tuition from Ansel Adams in his darkroom at Carmel, California. Much of his work involves long-term cultural projects especially in India, Cambodia, China, Libya and New Guinea. He specialises in the documentation of cities, often from the air. He has a particular interest in the cyclic fires and floods that characterise the Australian landscape, which he documents with aerial photography, and is known for his technique of photographing at night using partial artificial light during extended, or periodic, exposure.  Digital imaging and 3D  More lately switching to digital imaging, Gollings has combined 3D modelling with photography and the use of drones in the service of his architectural commissions. With Ivan Rijavek, Gollings was the co-creative director emeritus of the Australian Pavilion at the 2010 edition of the Venice Biennale of Architecture. The exhibition was titled Now and When and compared the existing state of Australian cities, and their counterpoint in the mining holes of the west, to the possibility of a radically different, paradigmatic city of the future. The images were either photographed from a helicopter in 3D or rendered in 3D using CGI. The project traveled Australia and Asia under the auspices of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade until 2013. In 2009-2010, with curators Sarah Kenderdine and Jeffrey Shaw and 3D production by Paul Doornbusch and Dr. L. Subramaniam, Gollings presented the Ancient Hampi exhibition at the Immigration Museum in Melbourne. Hampi is a townin Karnataka state, India, that lies in the ruins of Vijayanagara City. The exhibition consisted of a collection of Gollings‚Äô black and white night images completed during his visits over the 25 years from 1980 to 2005, adjacent to images in colour of contemporary India.

The trust is organized under the auspices of the Visual & Performing Arts Department of the University of Namibia and is affiliated to the Triangle Network of Workshops initiated by Sir Robert Lauder.  Introduction  Historically Namibia (in southern Africa) has been isolated by the politics of the Apartheid Government in South Africa from the rest of the world and especially from the rest of Africa (except South Africa) for over fifty years. This isolation has been in almost every sphere of interaction, but especially in the arts. The cultural boycott of South Africa extended to Namibia, and South Africa‚Äôs policy of destabilization of her neighbours ensured that Namibians did not interact peacefully with these ‚Äúfront-line states‚Äù. Since independence (1989) and since democracy in South Africa (1994) this isolation has been addressed in many different ways. Namibians are encouraged to see themselves as part of Africa rather than just a part of South Africa and in the Visual Arts, Tulipamwe has been a major force in the opening up of Namibia‚Äôs arts to Africa and the world and the introduction of foreign artists to Namibia. Tulipamwe, aptly, means ‚Äòwe are together‚Äô. As an international workshop it aims to fulfill the promise of its name. The first Tulipamwe International Artists Workshop was held in 1994. The workshops bring together about 20 artists from all over the world. Artists from Uganda, Zimbabwe, Mauritius, Rwanda, South Africa, Nigeria, Spain, USA, and Germany all applied. The selection process is strictly monitored by members of the organizational committee. The criteria for selection is based on the work submitted with the application and what the artist could bring to the workshop and on how much the artist is expected to gain from it, this allows for both students and professional artists to gain and receive in equal measures. Tulipamwe brings people together who have nothing in common besides their artistic passion which has proved time and time again to be all that is needed for success. Artists were not expected to come with any preparation, but rather to be open to new ideas in a new environment. Tulipamwe is funded annually by sponsors, such as the Triangle Trust and the Ford Foundation as well as the foreign embassies operating in Windhoek. It depends entirely on the support of these sponsors as it is a non- profit organization founded simply for the benefit of local communities and artists. In 2008 Tulipamwe was held at Okombahe, a rural community, with a design that included the local people. Five of the local residents of Okombahe participated. This article concentrates mainly on this workshop and the work created by the participants. After the long process of organizing and coordinating the artists met, travelled to Okombahe and worked together for two solid weeks. Both International artists and local artists where encouraged to experiment with different materials and styles. This gave all the artists the opportunity to learn from each other. Seven nationalities, including Namibia, where represented. These artists were all at different stages of training and understanding in artistic ability and inter-cultural contact. Many of the artists had attended international workshops of a similar nature while for others this was their first.  Brief history of Tulipamwe (1994‚Äì2003)  The Tulipamwe project was founded in 1994. Since then more than 200 Namibian artists and international artists have taken part in successful workshops. The Tulipamwe workshops have been held in many different locations; each of these was chosen for its peaceful atmosphere and more recently for the surrounding community. Tulipamwe has gone through a series of small changes over the last 14 years as it has changed hands three times during this time. The Tulipamwe project was originally inspired by the Triangle Trust's workshop model. This was an international model on which many other similar projects have been based. Tulipamwe was founded in Namibia with the help of a consultant from the UK, Anna Kindersly, who co-ordinated the first workshop in 1994. The coordination was then taken over by the staff of the Visual Arts Department of the University of Namibia (UNAM). UNAM and the working group hosted six International Artists Workshops until 1999. These workshops all concentrated on the artists‚Äô creative exploration. From 1999 to 2004 Tulipamwe was independently run by a Namibian artist, Jo Rogge. Four international workshops were held during this time. In 2005 it returned to the management of UNAM. The aims were then revived and revised and the workshops started again in 2008. 1994 ‚Äì Otjiwa Game Lodge The first international artists' workshop in Namibia was held at Otjiwa Game Lodge. The workshop was highly anticipated and much was expected of it. > ‚ÄúIn planning, the working group anticipated that the Tulipamwe process would > address a broad spectrum of creative issues relevant to contemporary > Namibian art. What however could not have been anticipated was the degree of > success. Not only did the workshop address these predicted issues but it > generated an exceptionally high degree of creative energy, experimentation, > and learning-through-sharing‚Äù (Francois de Necker, at the time a member of > the working group) It is clear that Tulipamwe exceeded its aims, this can be seen not only in the statements made by the participants and organizers but also by the fact that it continues to be promoted today. In this workshop the main impromptu educational focus was on sculpture. A lot of Namibian artists such as Silverius Olibile and Trudi Dicks started their first sculpture pieces at Tulipamwe with the help of sculptors from Zimbabwe, SA and Zambia. Artists attended from: Botswana, Namibia, UK, USA, Germany, France, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Senegal and South-Africa. 1995 ‚Äì Peperkorrel Farm Tulipamwe was then held at Peperkorrel Farm, this farm is the home and studio of internationally famous Namibian sculptor Dorte Berner. The coordinator of this workshop was Hercules Viljoen, a Namibian artist who is head of the visual arts department at UNAM. Because of the different backgrounds of the artists who attend these workshops different opinions are often argued over. In 1995 a spontaneous and rather explosive debate erupted over the relevance and validity of abstract art, the debate ended amicably and so Tulipamwe was all the more rewarding and renewing. The final exhibit at the end of the workshop brought with it a totally new experience for the National Gallery of Namibia. This was the first time that an installation piece was exhibited in the space. This installation, called ‚ÄòTerritories viii: Dreams of Africa‚Äù, was produced by Jack Beng-Thi a visiting artist from France-Reunion. Artists attended from France-Reunion, Congo, Namibia, UK, Germany, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South- Africa. 1996 ‚Äì Zebra River Lodge Hercules Viljoen coordinated this workshop at Zebra River Lodge, a country lodge in the south of Namibia situated in the beautiful Zebra River Valley. This Tulipamwe, like all the others, had the aim of encouraging the free flow of ideas and information between professional artists from within Namibia and from abroad. This meeting of artistic minds has been described as \\"an exciting and stimulating experience of personal growth that can not be duplicated other than in a similar workshop situation\\" by Cathy McRoberts, a Namibian artist in 1996. This workshop inspired one of its participants, Samuel Amunkete, to further his education in the arts. In a similar way the land art, by Eric Pongerard from France-Reunion, inspired many of the Namibian artists to continue in this style, and this is coming out more and more clearly today. Artists attended from: Botswana, Namibia, Kenya, Zimbabwe, UK, India, South Africa, France-Reunion, Zambia, France, Germany and Spain 1997- Otjiruze Guest Lodge By the fourth annual workshop, Tulipamwe had become one of the major annual events in the Namibian cultural calendar. The coordinator of this workshop, held at Otjiruze Guest Lodge, was Hercules Viljoen. The location of this workshop resounded so well with the artists that it was used again for the next two Tulipamwe workshops. This workshop brought out in its participants a wish to express their own social, political, moral, and religious beliefs. Eric Schnack, from Namibia, produced work depicting his disgust for game hunting. Max Edison, from Namibia, used his work to bring awareness to mistreated women and children. Moitshepi Mandidela, from Botswana, worked mainly on works that revolved around religion, his primary piece was called ‚ÄòMy peoples religion‚Äô Artists attended from: Australia, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, UK, South-Africa, France-Reunion, France, Germany and Spain 1998- Otjiruze Guest Lodge This was the last workshop coordinated by Hercules Viljoen before it became a privately run project in 1999. Nine of the participating Namibian artists had attended Tulipamwe workshops previously and were able to build on their experiences and skills. This is an important part of the workshop. 1999- Otjiruze Guest Farm Jo Rogge coordinated and ran Tulipamwe in 1999 and in spite of the change in coordinator the ethos remained the same. Seven of the participants had attended Tulipamwe before. Artists attended from: Namibia, Denmark, Botswana, Spain, Norway, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Rwanda, Germany, South Africa, Finland and Zambia. '2000 - Kansimba Game Lodge 'This workshop was held at a lodge near Karibib in the Erongo region and was coordinated by Jo Rogge. The participant from Zimbabwe, Chiko, remained after the workshop to host a series of printmaking classes at the John Muafangejo Art Centre. Artists attended from: Namibia, Norway, Zimbabwe, Finland, Zambia, South Africa, UK, Germany, Botswana, France and Spain. 2001 ‚Äì Gobabeb Research Station The experiences of the artists at the Gobabeb Research Station tended to be more tranquil and serene. This was mainly because the research station is in the middle of the desert, on the divide between the dune fields and the gravel plains, and is situated in an extremely barren area. This seems to have had an effect on the art produced, much of it inspired by nature. The artist from Ireland, Janet Crimble made a large piece of land art in the riverbed made entirely of the pods from the indigenous trees. Francois Niay made large drawings of natural objects. Artists attended from: Namibia, Northern Ireland, Botswana, Spain, Finland, France, Mozambique, South Africa, Norway and Germany 2003 ‚Äì Otjiruze Guest Farm This Tulipamwe was coordinated by Jo Rogge and had an emphasis on experience and professionalism. \\"Enthusiasm for participation over the years has not waned, rather, artists eagerly forward their applications\\". Sculpture and installation art once again were a huge portion of the work produced. Artists attended from: Namibia, Uganda, France, Mozambique, Finland, Norway, Zimbabwe.  Sponsorship  The Tulipamwe Arts Trust is an independent body attached to the University of Namibia which provides some logistical and administrative support but the workshops need to be funded annually. It is approved by the Ministry of Basic Education and Culture as well as the National Art Gallery of Namibia. The coordinator and the working group seek funding each year for the running of the workshop. The funding is used for transport, accommodation, catering, materials and publicity. Traditionally the workshop is funded by international donors such as HIVOS, a Dutch funding agency and the Ford Foundation. Funding is also acquired from local international agencies such as the Goethe Centre, the American Cultural Centre, the Franco Namibian Cultural Centre and UNESCO. The private sector in Namibia has also provided funding in the form of services and materials. The funders are acknowledged widely in the press as well as in the catalogues and on the web site. An Open Day is held at the end of the workshop to give an opportunity for the sponsors to meet and talk to the artists in their studios and to view the work created. At the end of a workshop the donors are presented with an artwork in thanks for their sponsorship.  Art Workshop Networks  Triangle Arts Trust is an umbrella organization that facilitates and supports various workshop initiatives in 23 countries all over the world. It helps to support at least 10 different workshop organizations in Sub- Saharan Africa. Artists often attend more than one workshop in various countries and start to form connections with countries, arts institutions and artists all over the region. Some of these workshops are: Thapong ‚Äì Botswana, Thupelo ‚Äì South Africa, Aftershave ‚Äì Nigeria, Batapata ‚Äì Zimbabwe, Kuona ‚Äì Kenya, Insaka ‚Äì Zambia Uta Goeble-Gross, from Germany, compared her experience at the 2008 Tulipamwe workshop to two other workshops she had attended in Cape Town. While these urban experiences were both educative and useful to the communities, they lacked the connection she felt to the other artists at Tulipamwe. She felt that the isolation in the empty landscape made it a more individual experience and so allowed her to expand, and work on a bigger scale. Arterial is an arts network for Africa and provides active network of individuals, organizations, sponsors, companies, and institutions all of which deal with African culture and the arts. This Network was formed to support African arts and to aid the growth of creative projects in Africa. An example of one of Arterials workshops was one that was held recently in Zimbabwe, Harare, it dealt with the marketing strategies of arts organizations. Tulipamwe makes use of networks such as this one and Triangle to advertise their workshops.  Benefits to artists and to the community  In 1994 Tulipamwe was coordinated by Anna Kindersley, from England, she described the benefits of Tulipamwe. > ‚ÄúThe benefits emanating from such a workshop are many and varied. The > positive effects in participants‚Äô work may sometimes be seen months later > together with the knock-on effects for the artists‚Äô respective community or > country. The inaugural Tulipamwe has created new and important networks > between artists in SA, West Africa, Europe, and USA. This will open new > horizons for Namibian artists such as opportunities to participate in sister > workshops and to exhibit and work in other countries.‚Äù When the aims of Tulipamwe changed to focus on community development (2008) the value of the Tulipamwe project also increased. The local artists who participate in Tulipamwe have the opportunity to apply their creativity in a cultural context and to pass on skills to their community. This may change the perception of artists as people who are willing to share skills and knowledge as opposed to people reliant on community aid. The idea that art can be an income generating activity is also now encouraged.  Location  Tulipamwe has always been located in isolated areas and, more recently, in rural communities. This is one of its unique qualities. These areas have been called ‚Äòmarvelous‚Äô and ‚Äòspiritual and quiet warming‚Äô. Many other workshops are located in large cities right in the center of the hustle and bustle of everyday life; Tulipamwe escapes this, and so much more time can be spent concentrating on the individual. Uta Goebel-Gross (2008; Germany) explained in her interview how the new environment allowed her to expand as an artist. The absence of day-to-day chores and commitments allows artists a unique space in which to make their art. At the same time, this rural setting allows a whole community to develop and benefit from the workshop. In 2008 it was particularly clear that Okombahe, its people and environment, featured strongly in the art works produced. Okombahe - the \\"Place of the Giraffe\\" appeared in the imagery of paintings and large ceramics were made out of clay from the Omaruru river and were fired in a self-built kiln. Found materials (seed pods, rusty tins) were in artworks and installations. As Seth Basson, a member of the Okombahe community stated, \\"I learned that you can make beautiful things from scratch, trees and waste\\". Personal benefits to artists  Local Namibian Artists  The fact that Tulipamwe was first of all a learning workshop was reiterated by many of the local artists who participated. They were often exposed to western art for the first time and many learnt about abstract and conceptual art from a different perspective. Links were formed across language barriers and many local artists worked in new ways for the first time. Like Ester Ihuhwa a Namibian craftsperson ‚ÄúI enjoyed painting on canvas for the first time. I was very happy to meet new friends from so many different places.‚Äù Dias Machate( 1994 Mozambique). ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a teacher but Tulipamwe was anyway a constellation of knowledges: a university in which anyone may become a student of another through exchanges of experience.‚Äù  Foreign Artists  Foreign artists often do not know what to expect from Namibia or Tulipamwe, the experience of working in a rural African setting is often daunting but nonetheless rewarding. Simon Faithfull, from Britain, participate in the 1997 Tulipamwe project, during his time there he wrote a journal of his experience. He worked both as a conceptual and installation artist. In an unusual turnabout, foreign artists are usually more isolated in their own workspaces than local artists, this is because in the large cities they come from they are pressed for studio space and find it hard to work in groups because there is a lack of space. Generally in developed countries people are isolated by their living arrangements, which are very different from the communal living apparent in less developed countries. African artists often share resources, materials, and space. They tend to work together on projects this perhaps originated in the communal making of traditional functional objects such as baskets and pots. In the words of a German Tulipamwe participant: ‚ÄúArtists are usually solitary and to be forced to work as a group is unusual and challenging. For me it was a journey of self-discovery where all the artists worked together and helped each other.‚Äù Exposure to raw materials such as clay from riverbeds, abundant indigenous wood and found materials has been inspirational to many of the foreign participants. Tulipamwe 2008 held in Okombahe, as an international artists workshop, was dormant for the 3 years between 2004 and 2007. This was due to a lack of committed people with time to organize an event like this. The new Tulipamwe was launched in 2007 with new commitment from UNAM to ensure that the project was sustainable. A new working group was gathered together; who would be responsible for the organization, funding and selecting of participants. Tulipamwe was legally constituted as the Tulipamwe Arts Trust and a Board of Trustees was formed, the trustees are high profile members of the Namibian art community as well as a lawyer and an accountant. In 2007 it was decided to work towards the first workshop in 2008. The original vision for Tulipamwe was not changed, instead it was given broader aims that encompassed a much larger goal. Tulipamwe now focuses not only on artistic development but also on helping needy communities by holding the workshop in their vicinity and including community members in the program.  The aims of the Tulipamwe Community Empowerment project  1\\\\. To create an invigorating artistic environment for Namibian artists to share creative skills with each other and with international artists. 2\\\\. To provide international artists with the opportunity to work in a unique African environment where they can explore new creative avenues. 3\\\\. To benefit a disadvantaged community by bringing positive energy, activity and community engagement to it through visual arts initiatives. 4\\\\. To allow the community the initiative to share in Tulipamwe‚Äôs funding by providing workshop facilities, accommodation and meals to workshop participants. 5\\\\. To celebrate local traditions and culture as integral part of the global community. 6\\\\. To create the opportunity for development in visual art, thereby contributing to Namibia‚Äôs cultural capital. It was decided to hold the next Tulipamwe International Workshop in a rural community. Various communities were investigated. Among those investigated was Gibeon and Bathseba, in the south; however, they were not chosen due to the lack of interest shown by community leaders. Instead the elders of the village council at Okombahe in the Erongo region near Omaruru were approached. Okombahe showed enthusiasm and could provide accommodation in the form of a large community house. The community was also able to provide catering services and had several interested artists who wished to participate. Six of these artists were chosen by the community elders and came in on a daily basis to work with the other artists. Through the different artist‚Äôs networks, including the Triangle Trust, a call for applications from international artists was sent out. There was an overwhelming response and the fundraising began. By May 2008 the selection process was complete. Artists from Mauritius, SA, USA, France, Germany and Botswana as well as 12 from Namibia where chosen to participate. Due to insufficient funds a lot of the artists had to fund their own travel costs. Tulipamwe 2008 was held in Okombahe (place of the giraffe) The following artists participated in Tulipamwe 2008: Nirveda Alleck, a painter and installation artist from Mauritius; Diana Hyslop, an object maker from South Africa; Hannah Naomi Kim, a new media artist and painter from the USA; Raphael Caloone an animator and sculptor from France; Uta Goebel- Gross a painter from Germany; Kim Modise a painter from Botswana; Shiya Karuseb an installation artist and print maker from Namibia; Gretta Nashongo a textile maker from Namibia; Helena Iitembu a painter from Namibia; John Nampala a ceramic artist from Namibia; Abneil Enkali a mixed media artist from Namibia; and Barbara B√∂hlke a painter from Namibia. Hulda Gomachas, Cecilia Gowases, Seth Basson, Sandro! Naruseb, MC Henry Gomachab and Ebeneyus Ebos were the participating Okombahe Community Artists. The artists arrived from their various countries a few days before the workshop. They were accommodated in a Bed and Breakfast. They spent the following few days getting to know one another in Windhoek. On the 16th of August all of the artists were transported to Okombahe with the use of UNAM combis. The Artists immediately got to work and started to experiment with new media. Half way through the workshop the artists were taken to the Brandberge on an outing. This was an astonishing experience for both the Namibian and foreign artists as many of them had never been to this area. Open day was held on the 29th of August, press, sponsors and other interested parties all attended. They were shown around the area and were given the chance to see the work that had been produced in the space where it had been made, they were also able to talk to the artists about the process of production. After the workshop back in Windhoek a public discussion was organized and held at the FNCC (Franco Namibian Cultural Center), and an exhibition of selected works was held at the Goethe Center. The exhibition was opened by Joy Sasman, the chairperson of the Board of Trustees; quite a few sales were made.

The full title of the first edition is Prodromus Entomology. Natural History of Lepidopterous Insects of New South Wales, collected, engraved and faithfully painted after nature. History The author and illustrator, John William Lewin, travelled from England to the new British settlement of New South Wales in 1799 (arriving in January 1800), becoming the colony‚Äôs first professional artist. His journey was sponsored by wealthy amateur entomologist Dru Drury, who was to be repaid with specimens of new insects. Despite initial delays and distractions, Lewin began his investigations of the natural history in the general vicinity of Sydney, eventually producing illustrated books on moths and birds, of which the Prodromus was the first. First edition The Prodromus was published in 1805 in London. The first edition contains 18 colour plates of moths found in the vicinity of Sydney, with accompanying descriptive and scientific text, with which Lewin was considerably assisted in the identification and classification of the species depicted, by entomologist Alexander Macleay. The moths are shown accurately with the food plants of their larvae, from which they were cultured by the author. Lewin etched the copper plates for the illustrations in Australia and then sent them to his brother Thomas in London for printing. The book was offered for subscription at varying prices for different qualities of plate colouring, and issued in imperial quarto, medium quarto and demy quarto sizes.Renard (2007), pp.32-33. It was dedicated to The Right Honourable Lady Arden. In the preface Thomas Lewin says: > ‚ÄùThe contents of this little Volume are Lepidopterous Insects, indigenous of > New South Wales, were there collected, painted, and engraved, by the Author; > and sent to London by him for publication, to furnish him with the means of > returning to England, his native country, after an absence of near eight > years, which he has spent almost solely in the pursuit of natural history, > principally in the branches, Ornithology and Entomology; in which he has in > New South Wales, and in Otaheite, made some hundred of original paintings; > from which it is hoped he may, by the profits of this little first effort, > be enabled to return and reap an honourable benefit, as their publication, > under his ingenious hand, we flatter ourselves, would somewhat redound to > the honour, reputation, and increase of those branches of the sciences in > Britain.

Later editions After Lewin‚Äôs death in Sydney in 1819 and his wife‚Äôs return to England, a second edition of the book was issued in demy quarto format, including an additional plate as a frontispiece, with the full title reduced to Natural History of the Lepidopterous Insects of New South Wales, painted after nature. The date on the title page is 1822, though many issues of the second edition were not printed until later, some as late as 1827.Renard (2007), pp.41-43. A third, facsimile, edition was published in 2007 by Gaston Renard of Melbourne, limited to 212 copies in the Edition Renard series.Renard (2007), pp.43-45. As well as the text and illustrations of the early editions, it contains historical, bibliographical and publication notes, a list of the current scientific names of the moths depicted, an appendix with a table indicating the ownership and whereabouts of known surviving copies of the early editions, with acknowledgements to those assisting with the bibliographic research.Renard (2007), pp.23-55. The Prodromus, in both its first and second editions, is a bibliographic rarity.

Also known as Jaintpur Estate, it is situated on the banks of a Himalayan glacier-fed perennial river, the Baya Nadi River, between NH-102 (Saraiya) and NH-28 (Motipur). It is a popular place in the Muzaffarpur district. Jaintpur Estate popularly known as Sarmera Estate is the home of the family of one of the most preeminent and powerful Zamindar in Bihar, Badri Vishal Naryan Prasad Singh, who was awarded with Diwan Bahadur. It is supposedly one of the most powerful political families in Bihar. Mahesh Babu, Usha Sinha along with her late husband Birendra Kumar Singh represented Vaishali and Paroo in Lok Sabha and the state assembly for over a decade. The family is well known not only for its land, politics and wealth but also for its honesty integrity and dedication towards the welfare of Bihar. It should be recalled that in the 18th century, the Jaintpur zamindar or Sarmera zamindar (estate), Bhim Lal Singh of Sarmera had established residential English cum vernacular school under the auspices of Syed Imdad Ali's Bihar Scientific Society, Muzaffarpur. Stephen Henningham informs us that the Jaintpur estate popularly known as Sarmera Estate had extended financial help to the cash-starved Congress during the Civil Disobedience Movement, 1930-34. In 1770, the ruler of Jaintpur estate popularly known as Sarmera Estate, Bhim Lal Singh donated Rs 50,00000 to the Bihar Scientific Society and the Bhumihar Brahman Sabha to open a college, which got named after him in 1785. Mahesh Babu's youngest daughter Usha Sinha was married to Birendra Kumar Singh (1943‚Äì95), the Jaintpur zamindar popularly known as Sarmera zamindar, who represented Paroo (Muzaffarpur) in the Bihar Assembly more than once. Birendra Singh also started an NGO, Lok Shiksha Sansthan; in 1993. Given his sensitivity for linguistic minority, unlike most other Public schools, the Public School run by the Lok Shiksha Sansthan offers the teaching of Urdu literature from standard V to X, and is shining as the best Public School of north Bihar. The District Gazette of Muzaffarpur has glowing words to appreciate the Jaintpur estate for patronising, education, art and culture. Mrs Usha Sinha (born in 1944, she was elected MLA from Paroo, Muzaffarpur in 1985, and then to the Lok Sabha from Vaishali in 1989; served as Deputy Minister, Family Welfare in the Union Government led by VP Singh) is particularly more concerned about the political empowerment of the women, testified by her efforts at mobilising the women to join the Congress. exercise is a passion for her, and she remains undaunted by the fact that in recent decades it is an uphill task to persuade people to join the Congress in Bihar, more so when the necessary organisational support is also not forthcoming. It should be recalled that Jaintpur Estate popularly known as Sarmera Estate had special relationships with Travancore royal family. In the Bihar Assembly (1985‚Äì90), she was lone legislator to have raised her voices asking the government to formulate a plan for the low-lying wet-land (chaur) of flood-prone north Bihar, for substantive agricultural improvement. In his political outlook, Mahesh Babu was more inclined towards the Gandhian values. He was extended, since his childhood, support by Shri Krishna Sinha (d. 1961), with whose help Mahesh Babu could pursue his studies in Monghyr and Patna. Shri Babu remained much helpful to him throughout his life for which he earned certain criticism, from various corners of the Congress party afflicted with bitter factionalism. In a personal note of memoir, his daughter, Usha Sinha says: \\"My father never imposed anything upon any one; it was his personal example that inculcated a sense of loyalty in his followers. I never found him reprimanding anybody, including the children of our family. One particular trait of his that has stuck with me was his belief in democratic principles whether at home or in the political arena. He was also a humble, soft-spoken, and disciplined man who had firm faith in the philosophy of humanism and secularism\\". [Hindustan Times, Patna] Nitish Kumar, the chief minister of Bihar paid a tribute to him on 22 June 2006 when he visited Mahesh Babu's ancestral village, Karnauti (Mahnar, Vaishali) and announced to upgrade the Middle School, named after Kamla, the wife of Mahesh Babu. This school is housed in the ancestral house of Mahesh Babu, which he had donated for the education of his villagers. In Monghyr, Kamla Seva Sadan and the Kamla-Mahesh Library are also functioning. This has a collection of thousands of books which were in the reading and possession of Mahesh Babu. Kamla had given up consuming salt ever since the Salt Satyagraha, and used only Khadi clothes throughout her life. Himself having undergone the tribulations and deprivations of an orphan child, he had also established an orphanage. Muzaffarpur, a fastest growing city, cannot forget the contributions of Mahesh Babu and the Jaintpur Estate, as a token of which they have named the chowk of Juran Chapra in the city, after this leader. Mahesh Babu's eldest daughter, Krishna Shahi, represented Begusarai in Lok Sabha several times and she also served as Union Minister. The affairs of Estate are currently managed by Usha Sinha, followed by her two sons Anunay Kumar Singh and Dr Anuneet Sinha. The descendants of the royal family are Anantveer Singh, Krishangi Sinha and Treya Sinha.

Tula pryaniki) is a famous type of imprinted Russian pryanik from the city of Tula. Usually, Tula pryanik looks like a rectangular tile or a flat figure. Making stamped pryanik is considered an art form. The imprints could include different patterns, symbols, images of the Tula Kremlin, names, congratulations. The cooking of the Tula pryanik starts with preparation of the dough. The dough is made from rye flour, honey, eggs, water and spices. Next the dough is cut into pieces and rolled out. Each piece is placed on a special board with a carved pattern to give the dough its intended form. The first layer of the dough is covered with a second one with a filling in between. To make the two layers stay in place the edges are pressed together. Then the cake is turned over so that the stamped image is on top and the surface is glazed with sugar syrup. The syrup covers the picture to make it more visible after baking. Historically, each carved board is used to create just one design for pryanik. A new board is made specifically for each design. In the past, pryanik boards were made by craftsmen and nowadays new designs are created mostly by professional artists. Modern Tula pryaniki typically have a jam or condensed milk filling, while the traditional ingredient in the dough is honey which is sometimes replaced with sugar. Pryaniki have been made in Tula since the 17th century. The first mention of Tula pryanik is in the Tula census book of 1685. Today, Tula pryaniki are made at the confectionery factories of Staraya Tula (Russian for \\"Old Tula\\") and Yasnaya Polyana and by several smaller companies. A Tula pryanik imprinted with the caption Tulsky (the adjective form of Tula) and the city's coat of arms In 1996 Tula opened a museum dedicated to its pryaniki.
