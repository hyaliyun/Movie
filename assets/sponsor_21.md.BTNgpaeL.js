The New York, Auburn and Lansing Railroad, also known as the Ithaca- Auburn Short Line, was the only interurban line to operate in Tompkins County, New York. Origins Bond of the New York, Auburn and Lansing Railroad from the 1st June 1905 Promoted by Albert H. Flint, the New York, Auburn and Lansing Railroad was chartered on March 16, 1900. It was to re-use the old \\"Murdock Line\\", a rail grade which had briefly seen service as part of the Auburn Branch of the New York and Oswego Midland Railroad, to connect Ithaca and Auburn, and would enter Ithaca via a friendly connection with the Ithaca Street Railway. The road was conceived of as a third-rail-powered interurban, but as the expense proved prohibitive, the line was only electrified between Ithaca and South Lansing, using overhead wire. Operations north of there were run by steam. The line used the Ithaca street railway's Tioga Street line from its terminus between State and Seneca Streets in Ithaca to the north side of Percy Field (current site of Ithaca High School), then climbed out of the Lake Cayuga basin through Renwick and Twin Glens, parallel to and below the current New York State Route 13, and reached the Murdock Line grade at South Lansing. It followed the grade north through the hamlets of Genoa, Venice, Scipio, and Mapleton. On the outskirts of Auburn, it swung east from the former Ithaca, Auburn and Western Railroad grade (which had built from the end of the Midland's Auburn Branch at Scipio to Genoa Jct., just west of Auburn), and reached a connection with the Lehigh Valley Railroad just within the city limits of Auburn. Construction began in 1906 from the Auburn end, and reached South Lansing on March 1, 1908. The line into Ithaca was opened on December 12, 1908. Operations McKeen Car 101. Service between Ithaca and South Lansing, was operated with streetcars leased from the Ithaca Street Ry. An interchange track with the Lehigh Valley was laid at Remington, near the base of the hill, but the steep grade and limited tractive capacity of the streetcars meant that business was minimal. Service from South Lansing to Auburn was steam-operated. In 1909, a 0.5-mile branch was built by Col. J.V. McIntyre, owner of the Rogues' Harbor Inn, from his establishment to South Lansing. This was also electrified, and regular service from Ithaca to Rogues' Harbor Inn was established. Throughout its life, the Short Line (as it was known to residents) faced stiff competition from the Lehigh Valley's Ithaca & Auburn Branch. The two-car maximum up the hill out of Ithaca effectively guaranteed to the LV the freight business of Ithaca, but the Short Line offered four trains a day between Ithaca and Auburn, against two for the Lehigh Valley. However, the Short Line lacked the financial resources of the Lehigh Valley, and struggled in the harsh upstate winters. It went into receivership in 1912 and was reorganized as the Central New York Southern Railroad in 1914 (organized May 28; property of NYA&L; conveyed July 14). At this time the initial grade out of Ithaca was eased somewhat with the construction of an S-shaped approach from Percy Field, replacing the use of the steeper Cayuga Heights loop of the Ithaca Street Railway; this is the abutment over East Shore Drive that is still in place. This gentler grade allowed the use of gas-powered McKeen cars through to Auburn, so that passengers no longer needed to change from electric to steam in South Lansing. The purchase of two McKeen cars to speed the Ithaca-Auburn run could not put off insolvency forever. The Rogues Harbor spur was closed on October 19, 1920, and the last run on the main line was made on October 19, 1923. The railroad was formally abandoned in 1924, and rail was removed in 1925, except for the line from Ithaca to Remington, which was operated by the Ithaca Traction Corporation to serve a powerhouse until 1931. Relics A Short Line abutment at Twin Glens. Much of the grade is still visible along the length of the route, though occasionally cleared for agriculture or new development in towns. In Ithaca, the roadbed is used for sewer access and maintenance, and has been proposed as the route of the East Shore Trail. In North Lansing, a fill constructed by the Short Line over Beardsley's Gulf (the valley of Locke Creek), replacing a 480-foot trestle of its predecessors, still remains.

It is located in the heart of an important ecological zone called the Sierra Gorda. It is also the site two of five Franciscan missions, including the first one, to have been built in the mid-18th century, and declared a World Heritage Site in 2003. The municipality is also home to a small but important indigenous group called the Pame. However, the municipality has been losing population since the mid-20th century even though recent events such as the town being named a Pueblo M√°gico have worked to create a tourism industry. The town The town of Jalpan is the municipal seat, located 180 km from San Juan del R√≠o on Federal Highway 120. This road then connects it to Xilitla in San Luis Potos√≠. It is also connected to R√≠o Verde in SLP via interstate highway 69. Although officially classified as a city since 1904, the current population is only just under 9,000 people (2005). The main economic activities within the town proper are commerce, livestock production and agriculture. The town is centered on its main square and one of the five Franciscan missions to be named a World Heritage Site in 2003. The main square or garden of the town is located in front of the mission church. It is filled with trees, which are often filled with noisy birds. It is an important gathering place, especially on Sundays when vendors sell snacks and toys for children. In the early morning, taxis to share with other riders gather at the main square, with their drivers shouting various locations. On weekends, there are artistic presentations. Across Independencia Street is the Museum of the Sierra Gorda. The building was originally known as the Jalpan Fort, constructed in the 16th century by Juan Ramos de Lora and is one of the oldest in Jalpan. The site served as a military fort for centuries and then as a regional jail for about fifty years. In 1991, it became the museum. It contains seven halls that relate the evolution of the Sierra Gorda region from the pre historic period to the early 20th century. The collection includes old maps of the area, pre Hispanic artifacts, fossils, displays about the Spanish conquest and evangelization, with emphasis on the five Franciscan missions and Jun√≠pero Serra, artifacts from the Mexican Revolution and a room dedicated to the indigenous peoples of the Sierra Gorda. Another building that faces the main square is the former Melchor Ocampo School, which was the first in the municipality. Today, it is the home of the municipal cultural center, which hosts exhibitions, and a number of government offices. The municipal post office is located on a side of the mission church, on a building that was part of the mission complex. During the Reform War, this building held General Mariano Escobedo prisoner. There is a crafts center called the Casa de las artesan√≠as. It exhibits and sells various crafts from Jalpan and surrounding municipalities such as those made of palm fronds, ceramics, pine needles and wood. It also includes food items such as fruit preserves, guava candies, fruit liquors, honey and regionally produced coffee. Near the town are the ruins of the former Hacienda del Rayo. One dish of the area is cecina serrana, which is dried beef marinated in sour orange and salt. Another is a ‚Äúzacahuilt,‚Äù which is an extremely large tamale made with corn, various chili peppers and pork or chicken. It is wrapped in a banana leaf and cooked all night in an oven. River shrimp called acamayas are another specialty and are prepared in various forms. Revoltillo are eggs cooked on a comal with a sauce made from ‚Äúcoyol‚Äù which is similar to tomatoes. Atole is flavored with sunflower seeds, small guavas or piloncillo. Climate Demographics There is a small community of Huastecos in Valle Verde, which has ties to a similar community of Mapatz, just over the border in San Luis Potos√≠. Most of the Quer√©taro Sierra Gorda‚Äôs population is Pame, concentrated in the municipality, especially in the community of Las Nuevas Flores, near Tancoyol, but also in San Juan de los Dur√°n, El Pocito, Las Flores, San Antonio Tancolyol and El Rinc√≥n. The total number of Pame in Quer√©taro is small, at about 200 people, but it has been growing along with Pame communities in nearby San Luis Potos√≠. However, the Pames of Quer√©taro are more integrated with the general culture than their counterparts in San Luis Potos√≠. Only one Quer√©taro community maintains most of the old traditions, which is Las Nuevas Flores, with primary economic activities including agriculture, the raising of rabbits, goats and sheep and the production of crafts made from palm fronds. Many Pames have migrated out of the area into various parts of Mexico and some to the United States. Despite their small numbers, the group is considered to be important to the cultural identity of the municipality. The municipality has been experiencing population loss since the middle of the 20th century, with many migrating out to the United States in search of better paying work. From 2000 to 2005, the population has gone from 22,839 to 22,025. Those who still remain in the municipal seat have moved from agriculture to industry or commerce. The only community which has had significant population growth, doubling over the last thirty years, mostly due to the main highway and work related to the Jalpan Dam. The mission churches The mission in the town of Jalpan The municipality has two of the five Franciscan missions accredited to Jun√≠pero Serra during his evangelization of the Sierra Gorda. These missions were declared a World Heritage Site in 2003. One is located in the town of Jalpan proper and the other is located in the community of Tancoyol. The mission in Jalpan was constructed between 1751 and 1758 and dedicated to Saint James the Greater, as defender of the faith. It was the first of five missions built to evangelize the area. The main portal is dominated by various forms of plants most local to the region. European elements include images of saints and the Franciscan coat of arms. Native elements include a double headed eagle with a snake as well as an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe. The facade is elaborately done in stucco and stone work, with ochre of the pilasters contrasting with the yellow of many of the decorative details. Much of the detail is vegetative, along with small angels and eagles. On the lowest level of the facade, there are figures of Saint Dominic and Francis of Assisi. There is also a small coat of arms with five wounds and the coat of arms of the Franciscan order. Inside the door, there are the images of Saints Peter and Paul. There is also a double-headed Mexican eagle devouring a serpent. On the upper left, there is an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe on the upper left, the Our Lady of the Pillar. These are the virgin images of Mexico and Spain respectively. This statue is said to have been taken by a general at the end of the 19th century. It was replaced by a more modern clock. Inside, the cupola of the Jalpan mission contains scenes of the appearance of the Virgin of Guadalupe. The mission in Tancoyol The Tancoyol mission is dedicated to Our Lady of Light. It is thought to have been built by Friar Juan Ramos de Lora, who resided in the community between 1760 and 1767. The facade is marked by a rhomboid window surrounded by a representation of the cord Franciscans use to tie their habits. The basic theme of the facade is mercy, represented by interventions by the Virgin Mary and various saints. The iconography of this portal is the most elaborate of the five missions. European elements include images of saints such as Peter and Paul and the Franciscan coat of arms. The image of Our Lady of Light has disappeared from the facade, leaving only curtain-like decoration supported by angels and images of Joachem and Saint Anne, along with Saints Peter and Paul. Saint Roch appears to counter plagues. There is also a representation of the stigmata of Francis of Assisi. The main cross at the top represents redemption with the crosses of Calatrava and Jerusalem on either side. Indigenous elements are found in the church‚Äôs interior, with an image of a jaguar and a person with Olmec features. Culture The feast of the Santo Ni√±o de la Mezclita is the most important in the municipality. This is an image of a child Jesus named after the Mezclita community. The image was brought to the community in 1890 by Antonio Velazques from Guanajuato and to it many miracles have been attributed. When it was donated, it was received by Father Roman Herrera, who began the annual festival in the Ayutla community. However, disputes over custody of the image forced the local bishop to take the image and give it to Jalpan later on. The festival attracts between 20,000 and 25,000 people from the various communities of the Sierra Gorda. Other religious events include an annual Passion Play during Holy Week, Day of the Holy Cross on May 3, Feast of James the Greater on 25 July and Day of the Dead. For the last event, there is a monumental altar to the dead erected on a small plaza in the town of Jalpan. There are several important secular events as well. The Feria Regional Serrana takes place each year in April and includes various artistic, cultural and sports events, including a fishing tournament. The Convivio de la Amistad takes place on May 1 on the banks of the Jalpan River in an area known as the Playita (Little Beach). The event is a very large potluck where families share food they brought. This usually begins after May 1 Labor Day events. Earth Day (Fiesta de la Tierra) takes place in June, sponsored by the Grupo Ecol√≥gico Sierra Gorda. This event is principally for children to promote the importance of conservation efforts. Huapango is the dominant traditional musical form, with two variations: huapango arribe√±o and huapango huasteco (son huasteco). The first is in process of disappearing because of migration of many rural residents and the urbanization of others. Huapango huasteco remains popular, especially in recent years with the emergence of youth trios dedicated to the music. It is most often played during traditional events such as religious feasts, Independence Day and the Christmas holidays. Many have become dependent on remittances sent from the United States from relatives. Many who work in the US return at the end of the year for the Christmas holidays. These people are called ‚Äúnorte√±os‚Äù (northerners) and are celebrated on 28 December called ‚ÄúEl D√≠a del Paisano‚Äù (Day of the Countryman). The festival has a number of events including the coronation of the Paisano queen, a mass, a pickup truck parade decorated with symbols of the US and the Sierra Gorda area and a charreada event called El Jalpense. At night there is a dance with live music. The event attracts about 5,000 people per year and covered by television. Originally, the event was purely for Jalpan, but it has grown to include participants from surrounding municipalities. In 2010, over one hundred pick up trucks participated in the annual parade for D√≠a del Paisano. Their owners raffled off 1,850 US dollars in cash. During the parade, the visiting ‚Äúpaisanos‚Äù show off their pickup trucks bought in the U.S. competing for the best and most luxurious. Economy and tourism The most important natural resource of the area is the forests, with commercial species such as pines and oaks. About 15,441 hectares of the total municipal territory of 329,020 is used for agriculture and 9,872 are used for forestry. Just under 29% of the working population is dedicated to agriculture, livestock and forestry. Only 650 hectares of agricultural fields are irrigated, with the rest worked only during the rainy season. The Tancoyol area has the most important agricultural production with beans, corn, chickpeas, cardamom, tomatoes, chili peppers and watermelon. Livestock production is most important near the municipal seat, with cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and horses, along with domestic fowl. Another product form Rincon de Tancoyol is honey which considered some of the best produced in Mexico. It is commercialized under the name of ‚ÄúMiel Xi‚ÄôOi Teneek‚Äù and much is exported to Europe. Coffee is grown on certain mountainsides in the municipality and has a distinctive aroma. About 17% to industry, mining and construction. Industry is mostly limited to handcrafts and food products in small family owned workshops. Ceramics are primarily produced in Soledad de Guadalupe by a cooperative of women. Their products include cups, plates, vases, glasses for tequila, jars for salsa, sugar and more. The pieces are molded by hand, fired than painted by hand as well. ( In Las Nuevas Flores, various Pame families make various crafts with palm frongs such as fruit baskets, flower vases, fans and more. These products are sold in outlets in Tancoyol and Jalpan as well as in the Museum of the Sierra Gorda. Leather items are mostly produced by the El Gavil√°n workshop in el Rinc√≥n de Tancoyol decorated with silver thread, stamped by other means. Articles include knife sheaths, carriers for cell phones, key chains, wallets, belts and more. The El Exilio Ranch is in the Acatitlan del R√≠o community and makes a liquor and a sweet pate called ate from guava fruit. The fruit is grown locally and the products are made by the family that owns the ranch. A number of families in Tilaco produce coffee liquor and traditional pastries and cakes. A large percentage of women are officially classified as homemakers. Commerce is the growing sector of the economy, with 193 registered businesses, five tianguis and two public markets. About 43% are employed in commerce and services, including tourism. Tourism has become the most important economic alternative for the municipality. The municipality received around 70,000 visitors in 2009, making it an important tourist attraction for the state. The number of visitors is expected to have increased for 2010 and continue to increase for 2011 for the Sierra Gorda given the interest in ecotourism. While the municipality attracts visitors from all age groups, the focus is on younger visitors, as these are more likely to be interested in ecotourism. The main ecotourist attractions include waterfalls, rivers and the Jalpan Dam. Most visitors come from Mexico City and the state of Quer√©taro. Jalpan de Serra became a Pueblo M√°gico in 2010 for its ‚Äútraditions, warmth, humility, historical valued and human quality.‚Äù The Secretary of Tourism for Mexico, Gloria Guevara Manzo, indicated that the municipality has great potential not only for its natural attractions, but for its cultural ones as well. The naming means that the community is eligible for federal assistance to improve the town‚Äôs infrastructure, especially the burying of electric and other cables. The Tancama archeological zone is located in the community of the same name, thirteen km from Jalpan. It is a site belonging to the Huasteca culture and dates from between 200 and 900 CE. The community of Acatitl√°n del R√≠o is six km from Jalpan de Serra and contains the ‚ÄúLa Casita Ecol√≥gica‚Äù (The Little Ecological House). This is a cabin next to an arroyo among gardens and mango orchards. The area is best for observing butterflies, hiking and mountain biking. The cabin accommodates up to four people. Valle Verde‚Äôs environment is one of the best conserved parts of the municipality. The main crafts producer in the community is the Soledad de Guadalupe ceramics cooperative. There is also the ecological water park called the Ojo de Agua de San Juan de los Dur√°n and the Cueva del Agua. These areas have cabins, camping, ecological education, bicycles and horses for rent and a pool filled with water from a local spring. The large numbers of people who send money to the area and bring money with them during the Christmas holidays has ‚Äúdollarized‚Äù the local economy. This currency is accepted in a number of businesses. It is estimated that about 18.2 million dollars each year comes into the area from the U.S. History The name comes from Nahuatl and means ‚Äúplace over sand.‚Äù In 1976, the appendix ‚Äúde Serra‚Äù was added to honor missionary Jun√≠pero Serra. The coat of arms for the city contains symbols of its history from its founding as a Franciscan mission in 1744 by Captain Jos√© de Escand√≥n. There are four elements: ‚Äúidolatry‚Äù represented by the goddess Cach√∫m in stone, the conquest and evangelism represented by a sword and crossed arms, the mixing of the two races represented by a double headed eagle eating a snake and the fourth represents the Jalpan and Tancoyol missions. The first settlements in the area were founded between 1700 and 1000 C in the small valleys of the Sierra Gorda by people linked to Olmec areas. Afterwards, groups from the Teotihuacan, Toltec, Huasteca and Totonac cultures would settle in various parts as well. Jalpan is in the center of the Sierra Gorda, a region situated between the sedentary agricultural and mining cultures and the hunter-gatherer cultures to the north. The strongest cultural influences in the area during the Pre Classic period were Olmec, Teotihuacan and Huasteca, with major settlements to the south of the Jalpan area. Huasteca influence since that time has been strongest in the very north of Quer√©taro, where Jalpan is, although relatively few of the ethnicity have lived in the area. This is because of trade routes, especially along the P√°nuco and Moctezuma Rivers. In the 1st millennium, Nahua tribes invaded the area, with artifacts such as ‚ÄúEl adolecente Jalpanse‚Äù dated to between 600 and 1000 CE. However, many of these artifacts still show significant Huasteca influence. By the late Post classic, the climate had dried to the point that much agriculture was no longer possible and many migrated out of the region. At the beginning of the 13th century, groups from the north, mostly Chichimecas: Pames, Jonaz and Ximpeces moved in en masse into the Sierra Gorda area, practicing hunting and gathering to sustain themselves. The Pames and Ximpeces also adapted gradually to village life and lived peacefully with neighboring cultures. Others, such as the Jonaz, never modified their warrior and hunter culture. They used the canyons and rough terrain of the area to launch attacks against more sedentary peoples nearby. Around 1400, the Pur√©pecha made incursions into the Sierra Gorda area after dominating the south of Quer√©taro somewhat, but never took control of the north. Tribes from the Sierra Gorda and north pushed the Pur√©pecha south and west into the south of Guanajuato and to the Lerma River area. The Aztecs had better luck, nominally turning the Jalpan area into a tributary state under Moctezuma Ilhuicamina . In 1527, Nu√±o de Guzm√°n conquered the Oxtipa dominion, to which Jalpan belonged. However, the Spanish did not take possession, due to the fierce opposition encountered, especially from the Chichimeca Jonaz. From then to the mid-18th century, there were various attempts to evangelize the Sierra Gorda area, including Jalpan by the Augustinians and Franciscans, but with little to no success. At the same time, there were military excursions, including the establishments of forts at Jalpan and in other places. Pressure on the colonial government to take control of the area intensified as the need for secure links to Zacatecas and other mining areas as well as a buffer zone against the new French colony of Louisiana . Jos√© de Escand√≥n was sent to pacify the area in 1740, which culminated in the defeat of the Jonaz at the Battle of Media Luna in 1749. This military action allowed for the permanent establishment of mission in the heart of the Sierra Gorda. In 1744, friar Pedro P√©rez de Mezqu√≠a founded the Jalpan mission. It would be the first of five major missions of the area. The mission‚Äôs founding was bolstered by the locating of 54 indigenous families to the area from the city of Quer√©taro. In 1750, Jun√≠pero Serra arrived to the Jalpan mission and worked with Francisco Palou to convert and teach new economic strategies to the indigenous peoples. Serra would be credited with the successful evangelization of the Sierra Gorda. The mission is Mexican Baroque with significant indigenous influence. It was constructed over a span of seven years and functioned as a hospital, dining hall and training center as well as a mission. The mission allowed the early development of economic activities such as agriculture, livestock and mining to groups other than the Pames, especially in a location called El Saucillo. The conquest of the Sierra Gorda would be the start of the domination of what is now the north of Mexico and into what is now the southwest United States, as the colonial government saw the importance of the region for economic development as well as a military buffer zone against the French and English. During the Mexican War of Independence, an insurgent group under Captain Elos√∫a formed, which was defeated by the royalist army in 1819, burning houses and storage facilities in the town, leaving it in ruins. In 1880, the first highway leading to the area was built connecting Jalpan to the state capital. This spurred economic development. In 1904, the governor of Quer√©taro, Francisco Gonz√°lez de Cos√≠o officially named Jalpan a city as it has telephone, telegraph and some electrical services as well as a sugar cane mill. In 1910, a group called Club Aquiles Serd√°n was formed under Policarpo Olvera. Others, such as Coronel De la Pe√±a, Conrado Hernandez and Malo Juvera fought against the Victoriano Huerta regime in 1913. There were also various military actions headed by Lucio Olvera between 1914 and 1924. In the early 1930s, there was a political struggle between R√≥mulo Vega from Jalpan and General Porfirio Rubio de Agua Zarca for dominance in the region. Between 1962 and 1970, a paved highway connecting Jalpan and the city of Quer√©taro was built. In addition a number of secondary roads, bridges, more electrical infrastructure and water services were constructed. Between 1980 and 1985, the Jalpan mission, along with the four others underwent restoration. This work and more would eventually lead to the mission churches being declared a World Heritage Site in 2003, at a ceremony at the mission in Jalpan by local, state and UNESCO officials. In 2003, the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Quer√©taro inaugurated the Jalpan Campus. The Universidad Tecnol√≥gica de San Juan del R√≠o opened a campus the same year. The city gained a second tier professional soccer team in 2004. Since the mid-20th century, the municipality has been losing population due to lack of economic opportunities. So many have left the Sierra Gorda to work in the U.S. that schools have closed for the lack of students. This loss of students has been most noticeable at the primary school level.

It is part of the Sierra Gorda region, which consists of rugged mountains, canyons and wide diversity of flora and fauna, with the municipality's flora representing about 25% of all the plant diversity in Mexico. In the pre-Hispanic period, the area was heavily influenced by Huastecas and local cultures, later dominated by the Chichimecas, especially the Pames. Complete Spanish domination came late, in the mid 18th century, but two of the five Franciscan mission complexes built to solidify this domination were built in the municipality. Today, Landa de Matamoros remains rural and impoverished with a high rate of emigration out of the area, especially to the United States. Remittances sent by relatives from there now form most of the municipality's economy.  The town  Landa de Matamoros sits at the foot of a chain of small mountains with crags at an altitude of 1,040m just off Highway 120 about 210 km from the capital of Quer√©rtaro. The town of Landa de Matamoros is considered to have first been occupied by a group of Pur√©pecha from Michoac√°n who migrated north. In the pre-Hispanic period, it had an important tianguis market, which traded merchandise from other parts of the La Huasteca and what is now Tampico. Today, Landa is a small community with cobblestone streets centered on a traditional main square in front of the mission. Landa's main economic activities include agriculture, livestock and services, including government services. It is also head of a district called Centro Estrat√©gico Comunitario Micrregi√≥n 01, which oversees economic activities of thirteen communities with just under 2,000 people. The town of Landa is best known for having one of the five Franciscan missions in the Sierra Gorda, which were made a World Heritage Site in 2003. This mission is dedicated to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. It along with the others are noted for their highly decorated Baroque facades, which contains indigenous elements. They were built under the direction of Junipero Serra in the mid 18th century, with the Landa mission built last, in the 1760s. The Museo de Arte Agropecuario (Museum of Agricultural Art) is located in Landa has three exhibition halls. One room exhibits the fossil remains of a mastodon, which was found under the mission church during restoration work in 1984. The other two contain historical photographs, as well as implements related to farming, livestock, forestry, commerce and home. There is also an area with for temporary exhibits and a handcrafts store. The museum offers guided tours, conferences and summer courses. There is also the municipal auditorium and a cultural center called a Casa de Cultura. The most important annual celebration is the feast of the patroness of the community, Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. At least a thousand migrants return each year to Landa to celebrate, with many of these come from Texas especially Corpus Christi, Houston, Austin and Dallas, bringing their pickup trucks and cowboy clothes with them, but a number also come from Florida and Atlanta. The town hosts a major dance for the occasion, in part to honor the returnees. The event is held during the first half of December. The event often features musical styles popular in Texas.  Demographics and culture  There are no longer any representative indigenous groups in the municipality, with only 36 speaking any kind of indigenous language as of 2005. Over 96% of the population is Catholic. From 1950 to 2005, the municipality's population grew from 9,226 to 19,493 people, representing a growth rate of 0.8%. Birthrates are high and mortality rates are low, however, since the 2000s, the municipality has experienced significant migration out. Without this migration, the growth rate would have been about 1.5%. From 2000 to 2005, the population has decreased to 18,905. It is estimated about 32% of the working age population of the municipality has emigrated to look for employment. Most from Landa migrate to Texas, especially Houston. However, those from certain communities tend to go to certain places in the United States. For example, those who are from La Lagunita generally go to Corpus Christi, while those from La Vuelta go to Austin or Dallas and those from the municipal seat tend to go to Florida, Indiana, Michigan or Georgia. Many from Tilaco go to Houston, although at least a few have gone as far north as Nebraska and Michigan. The money these migrants send back to their families is extremely important to the economy. Landa and other municipalities hold a yearly event at Christmastime in Jalpan de Sierra to honor those migrants from the U.S. who are visiting families. At the beginning of December, many of these migrants come back for the feast of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, often driving down in pickup trucks and wearing cowboy clothing. The event often features musical styles popular in Texas and also honors these migrants. The major feast days in the municipality include the spring equinox (March 21) in La Vuelta, feast of Isidore the Laborer, (May 15) in Encino Solo, Foundation Day (May 25) in Agua Zarca, Feast of the Sacred Heart (June 16) in La Reforma, Virgin of Mercy (September 24) in La Lagunita, Francis of Assisi (October 4) in Tilaco, and the Virgin of Guadalupe (December 12) in Valle de Guadalupe. Another traditional festival celebrated throughout the municipality is Day of the Dead, which is commemorated from 31 October to 2 November, with Huapango music, fireworks and other activities. The Feast Day of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception in Landa is 25 September, celebrated with masses, processions, offerings, dance, music and fireworks. The main feast day for Tilaco is 4 October, in honor of Francis of Assisi, celebrated with masses, processions, dance, including the dance of Moors and Christians, music and fireworks. Huapango is the dominant traditional music, especially the form called Huapango arribe√±o, but Huapango abaje√±o is also played. Typical dishes include nopals with pipian sauce, grilled nopal, river shrimp prepared various ways, atole, beans with nopal, pulque bread, enchiladas in various styles, sweets made from squash seeds, peanuts and squash, gorditas, pacholes, and sacahuil (a very large tamale). Creatures called \\"duendes\\" are often claimed to be seen in the area, especially in areas where there are horses.  The churches  Facade of the Landa church Facade of the Tilaco church The municipality is home to two of the five Franciscan missions in the Sierra Gorda, which were registered together at a World Heritage Site in 2003. The mission complexes standing today were constructed with stone and mortar under the leadership of Jun√≠pero Serra after he took over evangelization of the area in 1750. However, both sites had been Augustinian missions earlier in the colonial period, and the Franciscan missions themselves were founded in the 1740s. After the missions were handed over to regular clergy in 1770, they deteriorated over the centuries. Restoration work on all five churches began from 1979 to 1985, initially focusing on the integrity of the structures and the facades. From 1991 to 1997, restoration of the towns around the missions, including work on monuments, plazas, fountains, building facades, paving streets with stone and more were undertaken. From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, restoration of interiors were done, including to altars, choir areas, organs and paintings. Much of the work was done to encourage tourism to the area, and the work cost anywhere from one to two million pesos for each church. The Santa Mar√≠a del Agua de Landa is dedicated to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. The Franciscan mission was founded in 1744, the work on the current complex was done between 1761 and 1768, the last of the five mission complexes built. Its construction is generally attributed to Friar Miguel de la Campa, but a number of other Franciscans were active in the area at the same time such as Jos√© de la Sierpe, Domingo de Arroyabe, Esteban de Basabe, Pal√≥u y Pedro Jos√© Lugo Perez, Antonio Paterna Ramos de Lora and Jos√© Campos. According to legend, when the Landa mission was being built, there was a small stream that flowed from the Cerro de San Esteban past the mission site. Workers used the water from this stream to quench their thirst. When the complex was finished, the stream dried up and disappeared. The Landa mission is the most elaborately adorned and considered to have the most equilibrium in its composition. It contains a chapel, sacrament portal, baptistery, sacristy, cloister, atrium and garden area. The atrium is bordered by a wall with access on three sides. In the center is an atrium cross and there are stone paths in the interior of the atrium. It has a narrow bell tower, which is unified with the facade, which is primarily in ochre tones. The main portal includes a very large number of Baroque style ornaments, with vegetative elements and angels with support curtains. There is an image of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, along with a number of saints including James of the Marshes, Bernardino of Siena, John of Capistrano and Francis of Assisi. On the sides of the choir window, there are two important Franciscans, Duns Scotus and Mar√≠a de √Ågreda, along with the coat of arms of the order. At the summit in the center, there is an image of the Archangel Michael defeating a demon. The facade has a number of indigenous elements, including an indigenous headdress on the head of the Archangel Michael, but it is not obvious. For Landa, the mission was restored at a cost of one million pesos. The main plaza was also restored with items such as benches and lighting added. Lighting was later added to the mission itself. During restoration work in 1985, a mastodon bone fossil was found at the base of the church. The Tilaco mission contains a choir area, baptistery, sacristy, cloister, chapels and gardens. The mission was built on a mostly leveled incline. Its bell tower is separate from the body of the church, but connected through the baptistery. Structurally, the tower functions as a buttress. It is the smallest and simplest of the five missions. The main doorway is guarded by sculptures of Saints Peter and Paul. There are two niches with Saint Joseph with the Child Jesus and one with an image of the Immaculate Conception. Between the two, there is a dove, which represents the Holy Spirit. Above this, there is a rhomboid choir window marked by curtains supported by two angels. An image of Francis of Assisi is at the top of the portal surrounded by cherubs, some of which are reclined against pre-Hispanic style eagles. There are also four columns, each one supported by a mermaid. Mermaids are not often seen in colonial architecture and it is not known why they were included. Much of the rest of the portal is decorated with flowers and vines along with a representation of the cord Franciscans use to tie their habits. To encourage tourism to the mission, basic services were installed. There was also restoration of the main plaza and many of the facades around the mission church as well as paving work, which cost about 1.5 million pesos.  Environment  View of the Tilaco Valley The municipality is part of the Sierra Gorda region, which is centered on northern Quer√©taro state. This region is a branch of the Sierra Madre Oriental, consisting of mountain chains that parallel the Gulf of Mexico. This land was sea bed 100 million years ago, which formed ancient sedimentary rock, mostly limestone, which easily erodes. This makes the area part of the Huasteca Karst. Landa de Matamoros is completely within the Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve of Quer√©taro, which was established in 1997. Of the biosphere's nucleus, 1,250 hectares are within the municipality. Over eighty five percent of the territory is mountainous and rugged with inclines of over 25%. These are mostly found in the south, southeast and northeast. Main elevations include Cerro de Tejocote (2720 masl), La Cebadilla (2560 masl), Cerro Grande de San Juan (1580 masl), Piedra Encimada (1620 masl), La Barca (1380 masl) and Los Orujos (1260 masl). There are a limited number of small valleys, including Plan de Hongos, Tilaco, Tres Lagunas, Valle de Guadalupe and Acatitl√°n de Zaragoza. These areas are mostly covered by forests. Semi flat areas are those with gradients under 25%, with accounts for about 3.5% of the territory. Much of this area is either forested or arid. Flat lands with gradients of less than 5% correspond to about 11.2% of the municipality. This is where most agriculture takes place, mostly during the rainy season. Most of the flatter areas of the municipality have rich sedimentary deposits of topsoil over a bed of limestone, which was former seabed. The limestone and other sedimentary rock erode fairly easily, which has led to the formation of caverns and pit caves (locally called \\"s√≥tanos\\") dispersed throughout the municipality. The pit caves generally run from 400 to 600 meters in depth. Many have straight drops of between 50 and 100 meters, and end with a flat bottom with vegetation and wildlife. The largest is the Tilaco pit cave, 649 meters deep. The territory is a part of the P√°nuco River basin. In the north the main rivers are the San Juan and the Tangojo, which the Tancuil√≠n is the most important within the south. The Moctezuma River runs along the municipality's border with Hidalgo. Other flowing water includes the R√≠o Verdito and a number of fresh water springs and arroyos, most of which run only during the rainy season. As most residents of the municipality do not have potable water piped to their homes, there are large water storage facilities in Encino Solo, Landa, Tres Lagunas, Otates, Santa In√©s, Malpa√≠s and Acatitl√°n de Zaragoza from which trucks deliver water to home storage facilities. Many homes also have their own systems to catch rainfall and runoff during the rainy season. Most of the municipality is covered in various types of mostly deciduous forest, with leaves fully or partially fall during the dry season and the very cold weeks in December and January. Forests of pine, red and white cedar and sweetgum are prominent in the higher elevations. In the hot and dry areas, various cactus and other arid area plants such as cats claw, biznaga cactus, maguey, organ cactus, and nopals can be found. Landa has one of the few mesophile forests in the state of Quer√©taro, which is mostly found in steep canyon areas between 800 and 2000 masl. Between 600 and 800 meters, the mesophile forest blends with tropical rainforest such as in the bottom of the Tancuilin Canyon. A study of flora in the municipality counted 774 species of vascular plants, with the most diversity found in old growth areas where the thick tree canopy traps moisture. These areas have trees that measure thirty to forty meters in height. Most of the plant species are classified as herbs, followed by bushes, then trees, reeds, epiphyte and parasitic plants. Ninety one percent are classified as tropical vegetation. The variety of species here represents about 25% of the plant diversity in Mexico. A recently discovered species, named Physalis queretaroensis, is a rare plant restricted to the municipality. It is related to P. volubilis, which is restricted to Jalisco and Michoac√°n, but differs in form and insertion of the leaves and vestiture. It is an herb that grows about seventy cm in height in the forest areas of oak, pine and mesophile forests in altitudes between 1700 and 1850 masl. However, much of the forest is fragmented and highly disturbed. The best-conserved areas are in the canyons and steep inclines that are hard to access, such as the Tancuil√≠n Canyon around Neblinas and El Humo. Another area which is well preserved are the highest elevations of the mountains including the area around La Joya del Hielo, La Florida and La Yesca up to Puerto Hondo. In other areas, forests are broken up with patches of farmland or pasture. Despite being in the biosphere reserve, destruction of the environment still proceeds, even in areas considered to be nuclei such as La Joya del Hielo and Llano Chiquito. Landa de Matamoros, along with Arroyo Seco, have begun controlled pasturing using electric fences, which also allows forage plants to recover. They are also developing hydroponic forage, which is grown in water, without soil. This mesophile forest is found in the wettest part of the Sierra Gorda, where the moisture can reach the east facing slopes. Most of the area is classed as moist and semi hot. (A) C (fm) by the Koppen classification, or moist and semi hot, with most rain falling in the summer rainy season but rain and fog can be found at other times too, especially in the highest elevations. The average annual rainfall is 920mm although this has varied significantly in recent years. Temperatures vary widely depending on altitude. The high mountains areas are the coldest, experiencing freezing temperatures regularly, with the lower flatter lands having more tropical or arid land characteristics. The average annual temperature is 22C, with May as the hottest month, with temperatures rising as high as 43C. In January, there can be temperatures as low as -2C. In the 2000s, areas of the state have experienced hard freezes on several occasions, with temperatures as low as -10C. These freezing temperatures are due to cold fronts coming from the north and west. These usually only produce fog and light rain, with stronger ones causing freezing temperatures. Freezing temperatures have caused emergency conditions requiring interventions by civil authorities and have also led to loss of pasture for cattle. During the rainy season, large storms can cause severe flooding along rivers such as the Moctezuma and Tancuil√≠n. In 2010, flooding damaged crops in El Naranjo and El Lobo, with dozens of hecatares of corn damaged. The rugged geography makes roads vulnerable to landslides, with rocks up to 1.5 tons falling onto Highway 120. Recent years of drought have stressed the trees of the area and have made them vulnerable to insects. Wildlife includes pumas, bobcats, coyotes, foxes, armadillos, badgers, rabbits, white-tailed deer, squirrels, roadrunners, various lizards, and a wide variety of birds including macaws and parrots. The varied terrain has made for a number of natural attractions. The community of R√≠o Verdito has a waterfall located above the El Lobo-Agua Zarca road. The location has various natural pools of water and places to camp. The Tancuil√≠n River has canyons. The community of Tangojo on the Moctezuma River is noted for the fishing of tilapia, carp and river shrimp called acamaya. There are also facilities for kayaking and rappelling. The Santa Martha rest stop is on the Landa de Matamoros Xilitla highway at KM 230.5. It is a forested area with pines and cedars. The area has picnic tables. La Joya del Hielo occupies a small depression high in the mountains. This makes its vegetation unique, especially with the abundant presence of magnolia trees. It is considered to be one of the nucleus areas of the biosphere reserve.  History  \\"Landa\\" is derived from a Chichimeca expression \\"lan-h√°\\", which means muddy place. \\"de Matamoros\\" was added to the name in 1919, by a state decree to honor insurgent Mariano Matamoros who was here during the Mexican War of Independence. The coat of arms contains a number of symbols related to its history. The indigenous phrase (lan-h√°) and an image of the mission relate to its indigenous past and Spanish conquest. The name of Matamoros appears for historical reasons as well. Concentric circles signify the encounter of indigenous and Spanish cultures. The lifestyle of the area is represented by a maguey plant, an ear of corn, the sun, the mountains, a drum and a book. Leaves and fruits found in the upper and lower parts indicate the indigenous respect for nature as well symbols of greatness. To the left of the mission church, there is a representation of the native dance of San Francisco de Asis church in Tilaco. Landa's identity as Mexican is represented by the national seal, the Mexican flag, and the flag of the Landa mission. Landa de Matamoros is part of the heart of the Sierra Gorda. This region has been occupied for about 6000 years. In the Pre Classic and Classic periods, the Sierra Gorda had a number of small cities as the climate at that time was wetter than it is now. Most of the larger cities were south of the current municipalities due to mining activities and major trade routes, but there were cities and trade routes through here as well, connecting the area mostly with Huasteca areas to the east and other areas to the north. While most of the pre-Hispanic history of the area is dominated by peoples culturally related to the Huastecas, the site of the town of Landa de Matamoros is thought to have been first occupied by a group of Pur√©pecha who migrated north from what is now Michoac√°n. As the climate of the Sierra Gorda dried out in the early Post Classic period, cities were abandoned for simpler hunter gatherer communities and there were migrations of Chichimecas, mostly Pames and Chichimeca Jonaz from the north. Landa would become Pame territory. The Pame would continue to dominate this area for the rest of the pre-Hispanic period, but small communities of Otomis and Huastecas would also be established as well. The Aztecs also made incursions here, which led to the formation of the Oxitilpa dominion, a commercially based political organization allied with the Aztecs. Aztec records indicate that the Sierra Gorda was a tributary area, but it is likely that the Aztecs only controls parts on the periphery up to the P√°nuco River. This route leads to the modern settlement of Landa de Matamoros. However, archeological evidence so far is related to the Pame. The Spanish made incursions into the area early in the colonial period, but the Chichimeca, especially the Jonaz, put up fierce resistance to their intrusions. This would keep the Spanish from fully dominating the area for two hundred years. The Pames were considered less resistant and as early as the 16th century, Augustinians from Xilitla and Franciscans from Michoac√°n founded missions in the Landa area. However, these would not remain permanently. The Spanish would break Chichimeca resistance in the Sierra Gorda in the 1740s, with the expeditions of Jos√© de Escand√≥n, culminating in the Battle of Media Luna. To solidify these military gains, Franciscans founded new missions in this and other areas of northern Quer√©taro, the heart of the Sierra Gorda. These missions were taken over by Jun√≠pero Serra starting in 1750, who decided to have elaborate mission complexes built in five locations, two of which are in the municipality, in Landa de Matamoros and in Tilaco. In addition to evangelization, the missions worked to group the semi nomadic Pames into permanent communities centered on churches. A smallpox epidemic in 1762 caused the deaths of 5,300 and depopulated some of the mission communities. After the missions were handed over to regular clergy in 1771, the indigenous population of five communities abandoned their homes for the mountains because of abuses and inability to understand the new priests. During the Mexican War of Independence, various insurgents such as Ignacio and Rafael L√≥pez Ray√≥n, Jos√© Mar√≠a Liceaga, Juli√°n and Francisco Villagr√°n and Luis Herrera found refuge here. The most important person to do so was Mariano Matamoros, who was here from 1807 to 1808. During this time, he offered his services as priest at the Landa mission church. In 1825, Landa was part of the municipality of Jalpan according to the first state constitution. Until 1917, Landa was a subdelegation of the district/municipality of Jalpan de Serra. In this year, it was made a full delegation, and the community of Landa was recognized as a town. In 1941, the delegation was converted into a free municipality. There was unrest here during the Cristero War, with some taking up arms. Like the rest of the Sierra Gorda, economic development has lagged behind other parts of Quer√©taro and Mexico, in part to the end of mining in neighboring municipalities and in part to the ruggedness of the region's terrain. From the last decades of the 20th century to the present, the economic marginalization of the area has given the municipality one of the highest rates of emigration. Most migrants go to the United States, and the money they send back has now become the major income for Landa and the rest of the Sierra Gorda. However, the migration is dangerous. In March and April 2010, seventeen residents of the municipality disappeared while en route to the United States. Most are believed to have been kidnapped by armed men while their bus was in the state of Tamaulipas, taken to work in fields growing drugs. As of March 2011, the men have yet to be found, although four men were arrested in connection with the incident, for threatening the families of the victims. The incident has provoked the municipal government to advise residents not to go the United States, especially not through routes controlled by drug traffickers. Drug trafficking has been an issue within the municipality as well. In 2010, the Mexican Army identified a synthetic drug laboratories in the municipality. The lab was making crystal meth among other drugs and was the largest ever found in the state of Quer√©taro. This military has also been involved in the break up of a kidnapping ring as well. Two military bases have been proposed for the municipality along with another in neighboring Arroyo Seco, to guard the Quer√©taro/San Luis Potos√≠ against drug trafficking. One reason for the base is that there is a lack of police in the area because of its poverty. Economy The municipality has one of the lowest average incomes in Mexico. From the 1960s to the 1990, the percentage of economically active people in the municipality declined from 33.5% to 21.2%. It rose slightly to 22.1% in 2000. Over twelve percent of the employment is working in the family without pay. Women make up less than seventeen percent of the paid workforce. To improve nutrition in the impoverished area, amaranth has been promoted as an alternative grain to corn and wheat because of its exceptional nutritive qualities. This is a grain native to Mexico, but its use was prohibited and or discouraged by Spanish authorities because of it religious connections. Just over 54% of the working population is dedicated to agriculture, livestock and forestry. Agriculture is not a principal economic activity due to the lack of arable land. Most land is used for livestock and forestry. The agriculture that is practiced is traditional and in small plots. Around 3,400 hectares are farmed during the rainy season, principally in Landa, Encino Solo, Palo Verde, La Reforma, La Lagunita, Otates, Tres Lagunas, Acatitl√°n de Zaragoza, Tilaco, and Valle de Guadalupe. Most crops consist of corn, beans, sorghum, peas and chickpeas and coffee. Fruit trees include orange, peach, papaya, lime, avocado, grapefruit, lemon, sapote, plum, apple and mango. There is also sugar cane and coffee grown. The most important natural resource is forest area. These forests include pine, oak, oyamel, white cedar and strawberry trees. Some fine woods such as red cedar and walnut can also be found. Logging occurs on about 14390 hectares, or about seventeen percent of the municipality's territory. Most are located near the communities of El Madro√±o, Tres Lagunas and Agua Zarca. Most forest lands are ejidos or otherwise communally owned, with the rest privately owned. There are sixty eight locations dedicated to lumber and over 500 dedicated to collecting other forest products. The declaration of the biosphere reserve has allowed for better control of illegal logging. There are some mineral deposits such as magnesium, silver and lead, but they have not been exploited due to the lack of geological studies. There is also a small petroleum deposit in Tres Lagunas. About 63,700 hectares are dedicated to livestock such as cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, horses, various domestic fowl and bees. Most occurs in Landa, Agua Zarca, Otates, La Reforma, La Vuelta and Tres Lagunas because of the availability of natural and seeded pastures. Livestock raising has faced challenges due to recent climate changes in the municipality raising the cost of feeding the animals. Over 18% of the working population is dedicated to mining, construction, industry and manufacturing. Industry is mostly limited to a number of handcrafts such as leather goods and ceramics and some food processing, especially related to corn. Some communities create handcrafts such as wool items, ceramics including jars and comals, palm mats, knitted items, copal incense and wood items such as toys and furniture. Commerce and services provide over twenty one percent of the employment. The municipality has 195 commercial establishments mostly located in the larger communities. There are no municipal markets, but there are tianguis markets during the weeks in several locations especially the municipal seat, Tilaco, La Lagunita and Agua Zarca La Lagunita holds a large tianguis on Saturday. Most commerce is geared to local consumption and basic needs. There is some tourism, mostly associated with the two mission churches in Landa and Tilaco. There is only one two-star hotel in the community of El Lobo, with fifteen rooms and a restaurant. It is not known exactly how many people from Quer√©taro go to work in the United States, nor how many come at the end of the year to visit. Landa has one of the highest emigration rates in Quer√©taro. Most from Landa migrate to Texas, especially Houston. The dollars that return here have a large impact in Landa and other municipalities of the Sierra Gorda region. It is estimated that between 50,000 and US$100,000 per day comes into the Sierra Gorda region, or about 18 million per year based on estimates of money changed in the area. This quantity is more than the entire municipal budge of Landa and accounts for most of the money residents live on, dwarfing the amount made through the local economy of farming and forestry. The currency itself circulates here, accepted in a number of businesses. In the community of Tres Lagunas, there are three hundred families with at least one member from each in the United States. All of its streets, including the entrance road are dirt. Many of the houses are now of brick or block, with satellite TV, paid for by remittance money, but there is no piped water. Dollars sent back by migrants in the United States is not only received directly by families, it is also used to fund public works projects through organizations such as the Federacion de Clubes de Migrantes de la Sierra Gorda, which includes six groups from Landa de Matamoros. Much of this money is matched two for one by the Mexican federal government. The first community to benefit from this problem was La Lagunita, with an initial offering of US$5,000. Most works focus on paving, water systems, drainage and electricity. This money is so important to Landa and other Sierra Gorda municipalities that there is an annual event dedicated to them each December in Jalpan de Serra, which Landa partially sponsors, called \\"D√≠a del Paisano\\".  Archeology  There are two archeological zones/former ceremonial sites in El Lobo and a cave area in the community of Neblinas. There are small indigenous temples in Potero del Llano, Agua Zarca, El Sabinito and La Campana, which contain stone and clay idols linked to the Pame, Huasteco and Jonaz cultures. The La Campana site in the municipality has been sacked and destroyed, despite recent measures taken to protect local sites. The crime was reported by archeologists Mar√≠a Teresa Mu√±oz Espinoza and Jos√© Carlos Casta√±eda Reyes, who state that this is the most important site of the area. The site belongs to the Huasteca culture and dated to about 600 CE. It is located between the communities of La Campana and Las √Ånimas. The site has also been damaged by landslides, possibly provoked by the illegal mining of white sand in the area. This is where the worst damage to the site is. The site measures thirty eight meters long and five meters in depth. Thefts include a complete burial with various ceramic objects. A large grinding stone was destroyed intentionally. The site was discovered about sixty years ago but there has been no budget to excavate it formally. However, there have been about 160 structured counted including platforms, plazas, patios and more. There is a push to cover and protect the area, especially that closest to where the sand mining occurs. Fossils found in the area include those of marine life in the community of El Madro√±o and Pleistocene animals in the municipal seat, principally that of mastodons. The Sierra Gorda region 100 million years ago was sea bed. The El Madro√±o fossil deposit is one of the most important of its kind in Mexico as it is the only one with such a wide diversity of species in excellent state of conservation. Many of the species found have been identified and include a large number of invertebrate species and species not before found in the region. However, research into the area has not been concluded.

In the , Mossman Gorge had a population of 246 people. The locality takes its name from the valley Mossman Gorge created by the Mossman River through the Daintree National Park to the west of the locality (in Syndicate and Shannonvale). The Mossman Gorge Centre is the gateway to the valley which is a tourist attraction with a suspension bridge providing access to a loop walk through the rainforest of the National Park. It is part of the traditional homeland of the indigenous Kuku Yalanji people ( (Goo-goo Ya-lan-gee).  Geography  The locality is approximately 77 km from Cairns along the Captain Cook Highway.  History of Mossman Gorge  The Eastern Kuku Yalanji (Goo-goo Ya-lan-gee) people have occupied this area for thousands of years prior to first contact. They are recognised as the Traditional Owners for this area.Walker on behalf of the Eastern Kuku Yalanji People v State of Queensland [2007]FCA 1907. = European Contact = European settlement of the Mossman Gorge district began with the discovery of gold. In 1872, William Hann was commissioned by the Queensland Government to explore Cape York Peninsula to assess its mineral and land resources. During the exploration, one of Hann‚Äôs party discovered gold on the Palmer River.Author unknown, ‚ÄòMr Hann‚Äôs Exploring Party‚Äô, Brisbane Courier, 17 December 1872, 4; G C Bolton, Hann, William (1837-1889) (Australian Dictionary of Biography 2013) http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hann-william-3708 at 22 January 2013. After hearing of the discovery, James Mulligan led an expedition to the Palmer River in 1873. Mulligan reported that the sandbars of the river glittered with gold, which started a huge gold rush to the district.G Pike, Queen of the North: A Pictorial History of Cooktown and Cape York Peninsula (G Pike, Mareeba, 1979) 22-23. By late 1873 the first government officials and prospectors came ashore at the Endeavour River accompanied by a detachment of Native Police. Cooktown was established to service the Palmer River. Within 4 months, Cooktown and the Palmer River goldfield had a population of about 3,000 people.H Pohlner, Gangurru (Hope Vale Mission Board, Milton, 1986). After James Mulligan found gold on the Hodgkinson River in 1876, Port Douglas was established as a port to service the Hodgkinson goldfield. The town grew rapidly and at the height of the gold rush had a population of 12,000.Cairns Museum, Mining, (date unknown) http://www.cairnsmuseum.org.au/mining.htm at 23 January 2013. With the help of Native Police patrols, European settlement expanded along the coastal belt, and extensive areas of lowland rainforest were cleared. In 1874, the Native Police were sent to explore the country inland from Trinity Bay to find another road to the Palmer River. They followed the Bloomfield River upstream but were unable to penetrate the thick scrub. The Native Police officer reported that they had found the Aborigines \\"exceedingly daring and threatening\\" and ‚Äò\\"had to disperse them on 3 or 4 occasions\\".[7]Author unknown, ‚ÄòThe Palmer‚Äô, The Queenslander, 4 April 1874, 8. At the newly established Port Douglas, it was reported in a newspaper, with reference to the Native Police, that:Author unknown, ‚ÄòProgress at Port Salisbury‚Äô, The Queenslander, 6 October 1877, 6. > \\"Sub-Inspector Douglas had paid the settlement a visit and ‚Äòsucceeded in > driving about a dozen blackfellows into the sea, a few miles south of this > place, and shortly after some desultory firing took place in a scrub close > by, the result of which is not known‚Äô\\" Vast amounts of cedar were harvested from the Mossman River and Daintree River valleys during the 1870s, resulting in further clashes between the Kuku Yalanji and the settlers. In 1878, Aborigines were reported to have killed three cedar cutters on the Daintree River. As was the usual practice after these events, the Native Police were sent to avenge the deaths.Author unknown, ‚ÄòPort Douglas‚Äô, Brisbane Courier, 2 February 1878, 7. In 1880, the Native Police were sent to the Mossman River after Aborigines attacked a Chinese camp and speared to death one of the occupants.Author unknown, ‚ÄòThe Palmer‚Äô, The Queenslander, 30 October 1880, 563. By 1882, the cedar on the Mossman River was almost worked out and the land was being cleared to grow sugar cane.Author unknown, ‚ÄòPort Douglas‚Äô, The Queenslander, 29 April 1882, 518; Author unknown, ‚ÄòPort Douglas‚Äô, Brisbane Courier, 30 October 1882, 3.

This frontier violence was a frequent occurrence in the region during the 1870s and 1880s. Selector Daniel Hart from the Mossman River wrote to the Queensland Premier in 1889, stating that, since the Europeans had taken all the land in the district, the Aborigines were being driven to starvation, which forced them to steal food, which then resulted in reports to the police.

In 1916, an Aboriginal reserve at Mossman Gorge was gazetted on 64 acres of land donated by a cane farmer named Jack Johnston, of Mango Park Estate, Mossman River.R Guy, Baptised Among Crocodiles (Assembly of God, Mossman Gorge, 1999) 10, http://webjournals.ac.edu.au/journals/EB/baptised-among-crocodiles/chapter- one-european-settlement-leading-to-mission/ at 8 April 2013. Some of the Kuku Yalanji who had survived the onslaught of European settlement and had not been removed by the government, gradually moved to the Mossman Gorge Mission. Those who did make the shift generally came from their traditional camps at sites like Jinkalmu, Brie-Brie and the Junction on the Mossman River.B Chant, Hetherington, Isabella (1870-1946) (Australian Dictionary of Biography 2013) http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hetherington-isabella-12980 at 23 January 2013. The Gorge Mission was managed by Pentecostal missionary Isabella Hetherington, who had arrived in Mossman Gorge about 1930. Initially, Hetherington and her companion Ethel Vale lived in a humpy and undertook the heavy manual work of clearing dense scrub, planting gardens and establishing a school. As the mission was not recognised by the government, it was often without funds, but the missionaries carried out ministerial duties including conducting funerals, and tending to the sick. In 1933, Hetherington was recognised as an Assembly of God missionary and a small school and church were built at the mission. She managed the mission until her death in August 1946. She was buried in the Mossman Gorge cemetery. After Hetherington passed away, Ethel Vale took over.

In 1962, the population of Gorge Mission increased after the Daintree Mission was closed and its residents transferred to the Gorge Mission.R Guy, Baptised Among Crocodiles (Assembly of God, Mossman Gorge, 1999) 10, http://webjournals.ac.edu.au/journals/EB/baptised-among- crocodiles/chapter-one-european-settlement-leading-to-mission/ at 8 April 2013. p127. The Daintree Mission had its beginnings in 1926, after 120 acres of land had been gazetted as an Aboriginal reserve on the Daintree River.Queensland, Queensland Government Gazette,16 October 1926, 1590. In 1935, the Almason Estate at Bailey's Creek was purchased for the purpose of establishing an Aboriginal mission, to be controlled by the Seventh Day Adventists for the Aboriginal people living around the Daintree district.Queensland State Archives, Chief Protector of Aboriginals Office, Series SRS 4356, Item A/58859, 1937/1074, Batch File: Aboriginals, Reserves N, Bayleys Green. In September 1940, the Protector of Aboriginals at Mossman Gorge wrote to the Director of Native Affairs in relation to the unsuitability of the Aboriginal reserve on the Daintree River. He noted that the land was too steep to be cultivated and there were no suitable building sites on the reserve. After Seventh Day Adventist missionary, Jardine Green, departed from the Daintree Camp in 1940, Pastor William Arehurst and his wife, who belonged to the Assemblies of God church, offered to take over and establish a mission station near the old reserve. Pastor H S G Davidson ran the mission until his resignation in December 1945. During his time, Davidson made several unsuccessful attempts to increase his control over the Aboriginal people on the mission by requesting to be appointed a superintendent. The Director of Native Affairs Office, however, would only appoint a superintendent if the land on which the mission was situated was gazetted as an Aboriginal reserve. This was not possible unless the land, which was owned by the church, was surrendered to the Crown. Eventually, in 1947, the Assembly of God church offered to sell the mission to the government. The purchase was not approved; the church then attempted to offer the mission to the government under a deed of trust. This option was also rejected.Queensland State Archives 6Q/2, letter dated 28.9.1940. On 5 July 1962, the Assembly of God advised that arrangements to close down the Daintree Mission had been completed and that the Daintree Mission families had been transferred to the Mossman Gorge Mission.R Guy, Baptised Among Crocodiles (Assembly of God, Mossman Gorge, 1999) 10, http://webjournals.ac.edu.au/journals/EB/baptised-among-crocodiles/chapter- one-european-settlement-leading-to-mission/ at 8 April 2013. p127. Australian brushturkey at Mossman Gorge In 1973, one of the last Assembly of God missionaries at the Gorge Mission departed, and the mission was handed over to the Australian Inland Mission. Towards the end of the 1970s, the Brethren replaced the Church of Christ as missionaries at Mossman Gorge. At the end of 1995, the Brethren departed, leaving only itinerant missionaries.GR Guy, Baptised Among Crocodiles (Assembly of God, Mossman Gorge, 1999) 10, http://webjournals.ac.edu.au/journals/EB/baptised-among-crocodiles/chapter- one-european-settlement-leading-to-mission/ at 8 April 2013. p140. Fauna Fauna commonly observed in the gorge includes the Australian brushturkey, orange-footed scrubfowl, the brilliant metallic-blue Ulysses butterfly and the Boyd's forest dragon. More than 430 species of birds have been spotted in the gorge, along with 18 species of reptiles, 12 species of amphibians and several species of fishes. Seasonally, the buff-breasted paradise kingfisher visits, nests and breeds. Jungle perch or spotted flagtail fish are commonly observed in the river waters from the popular tourist spot at the river‚Äôs edge. Flora Spurwood, Dysoxylum pettigrewianum at Mossman Gorge More than five hundred different species of Australian native plants grow in the lowland tropical rainforests in the gorge area, including a wide diversity of species of trees, shrubs, vines, epiphytes and ferns. Some species abundant along the public walking tracks, often noticed and photographed by tourists, are as follows. The bright orange seasonally fruiting, small shrubs of chain fruits Alyxia ruscifolia and hairy red pittosporum Pittosporum rubiginosum occur commonly along the tracks. Many vine species grow up to the canopy, including the well known and conspicuous wait-a-while or rattan palm‚Äìvines Calamus australis and more related spp.. Many epiphytes grow on the trees‚Äô branches and trunks, including the often noticed ferns, the birds‚Äìnest ferns Asplenium australasicum, basket ferns Drynaria rigidula and elkhorn ferns Platycerium hillii; large epiphyte and hemiepiphyte trees and shrubs, including commonly the many strangler figs Ficus spp., umbrella trees Schefflera actinophylla and the cape jitta Fagraea berteroana. Locally abundant and conspicuous large trees include the Daintree penda Lindsayomyrtus racemoides with wet season purple new foliage growth, abundant cauliflorous trees that have flowers and fruits on the trunk, for example, the cluster figs species Ficus spp. and the yellow mahogany trees Dysoxylum parasiticum. Further locally abundant species of trees include the Australian native nutmeg trees Myristica insipida, the several lady apples or lilly pillies species Syzygium spp. and lining the Mossman River and the creeks‚Äô banks the golden penda trees Xanthostemon chrysanthus.

Ioan (or Ion) Fluera»ô (or Fluiera»ô) (November 2, 1882 - June 7, 1953) was a Romanian social democratic politician and a victim of the communist regime. Biography =Early activities= Born in Cherelu»ô (Ker√ºl≈ës), Arad County, in the Cri»ôana region,Constantiniu; Roz he trained as a wheelwright and settled in Arad, where he became active in socialist circles. In 1901, he joined the Social Democratic Party of Hungary, and began contributing to its press in Hungary; with Iosif Jumanca and Tiron Albani, he led the Party's ethnic Romanian wing.110 ani de social-democra»õie, p.3, 15 The latter eventually reformed itself as the Social Democratic Party of Transylvania and Banat. At the time, Fluera»ô unsuccessfully ran in elections for the Hungarian diet.Roz Between 1906 and 1914, he was editor-in-chief of AdevƒÉrul (the party newspaper), until it was closed down by Hungarian authorities. Living in Budapest, Fluera»ô was conscripted after the outbreak of World War I, and worked for the Austro-Hungarian Air Service in a factory on Csepel Island. =Transylvanian politics= In the summer of 1918, he and Jumanca became involved in reestablishing AdevƒÉrul, which, inspired by the Fourteen Points, became connected with the fight for emancipation of Romanians in Transylvania and Banat, and their eventual union with Romania. Before the Aster Revolution, Fluera»ô and Jumanca were charged with contacting the Romanian National Party, negotiations which led, in early October, to the creation of Consiliul Na»õional Rom√¢n Central (CNRC, the Central Romanian National Council).Constantiniu The CNRC was instrumental in convoking the Alba Iulia Assembly of December 1, 1918, one which declared Transylvania's secession from the Hungarian Republic, and its will to join with Romania; Fluera»ô was the Assembly's vice president, and subsequently served as Chief of Department of Social Security and Hygiene in the Directory Council (the de facto government of the region, led by Iuliu Maniu).110 ani de social- democra»õie, p.16; BrƒÉtescu; Constantiniu; Roz Among the other Social Democrats in the Council were Jumanca, Albani, and Enea Grapini. On the very day of the Alba Iulia Assembly, he was elected general secretary of the Social Democratic Party of Transylvania and Banat. Later in the same month, after a strike was worker's rally broken up in Bucharest and the newly created Socialist Party of Romania (PS) repressed, Fluera»ô and Jumanca, urged by Constantin Titel Petrescu, met with King Ferdinand I and Premier Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu, persuading them to grant concessions to the labor movement.BrƒÉtescu In 1920, he was one of Romania's envoys to the Paris Peace Conference. =Interwar Romania= In late 1918, the Transylvanian and Banat socialists agreed to join the PS as a distinct section. In late 1919, Fluera»ô, Jumanca, and Ilie Moscovici carried unsuccessful negotiations for a merger between Alexandru Averescu's People's League and the Socialist groups; talks were mediated by Constantin Argetoianu.Argetoianu Alongside Gheorghe Cristescu, Alexandru Dobrogeanu- Gherea and others, Fluera»ô was a delegate to the Second Congress of the Comintern in Moscow, where the matter of the PSR's joining of the international body and its support of Bolshevik lines were debated. The Transylvanian delegates and, as a former member of the Directory Council, Fluera»ô first and foremost, were the target of Nikolai Bukharin and Christian Rakovsky's attacks, given that they supported a Greater Romania in front of Bolshevik principles; upon their return, Fluera»ô, Gheorghe Popovici, and others were expelled from the PS (despite Cristescu's reserves) -- the remaining group reformed itself as the Romanian Communist Party (PCR).110 ani de social-democra»õie, p.17; Constantiniu; Denize; FrunzƒÉ, p.22-23, 269-270; Roz; TismƒÉneanu, p.45-46 After the reestablishment of the Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSD) as a socialist group opposed to the PCR, Fluera»ô served several terms as a party representative to the Chamber of Deputies of Romania. He settled in Bucharest in 1922, and worked for the Labor Ministry. With Moscovici, »òerban Voinea, and Iacob Pistiner, Fluera»ô represented the PSD to the 1924 Congress of the Labor and Socialist International in Marseille.110 ani de social-democra»õie, p.19 When the authoritarian regime of King Carol II was imposed in 1938, he supported the change and remained active in the guilds established by the new corporatist structure of the National Renaissance Front (as a member of the Upper Economic Council and the Senate).110 ani de social- democra»õie, p.23, 24; Constantiniu; TismƒÉneanu, p.60 A potential target of Iron Guard reprisals during the National Legionary State, Fluera»ô survived the Legionnaires' Rebellion, and, upon the Guard's defeat, sent a congratulatory telegram to ConducƒÉtor Ion Antonescu.Scurtu, p.11 He retreated from public life for the rest of World War II. =After World War II= In early 1945, after the royal coup that toppled Ion Antonescu's pro-Nazi regime and placed Romania in the Allies camp, Fluera»ô and George Grigorovici founded the Socialist Democratic Party, which claimed legitimacy inside the socialist camp and denounced collaboration with the Communists.110 ani de social-democra»õie, p.24 It was dissolved in September 1946. Fluera»ô remained opposed to the main Social Democratic Party (PSD), and accused the growing Soviet influence which had found its advocates inside the latter political group (the wing led by Lothar RƒÉdƒÉceanu and »òtefan Voitec). He also allegedly refused office in the Communist-backed Petru Groza government, and rallied with Constantin Titel Petrescu's Independent Social Democrats, which had split with the PSD over the issue of running common lists with the communists. He was arrested in late 1948, presented as a dissident PSD member,FrunzƒÉ, p.229, 283 tried for \\"having collaborated with a fascist regime\\", and held in various prisons inside the country, where he was routinely tortured, being ultimately murdered by two fellow inmates, Constantin Juberian and »òtefan Rek in Gherla prison (according to one testimony, he was beaten to death with sandbags).Traiul »ôi sf√¢r»ôitul...

(1835‚Äì1923) was a worldwide known French prelate, liturgist and scholar who reconstituted the Gregorian chant.Dom Pothier (1898) Benedictine life Born in 1835 at Bouzemont, France, Dom Joseph Pothier was ordained a priest in the diocese of Saint-Di√© in 1858, before immediately joining St Peter's Abbey, Solesmes under Abbot Dom Prosper Gu√©ranger.Leachman OSB, James. \\"Dom Joseph Pothier\\", Liturgy Institute, February 17, 2012 By founding, in the then derelict priory of Solesmes, the first new abbey of the Order of Saint Benedict in France, Dom Gu√©ranger had re-established monastic life in the country after it had been wiped out by the French Revolution. Pothier later was made subprior (1862-1863 and 1866-1893) of Solesmes, then claustral prior (1893-1894) of St Martin's Abbey, Ligug√©, also a former deserted priory which had been resettled by Solesmes. In 1895 he became superior of the colony of monks from Ligug√© sent to repopulate the monastery of St Wandrille (Fontenelle), an ancient and abandoned Benedictine abbey - also suppressed during the French Revolution - in Saint-Wandrille-Ran√ßon, Normandy. Pope Leo XIII having restored the abbatial title of Fontenelle specially for him, Dom Pothier was eventually raised to the dignity of Abbot of St Wandrille's Abbey (installed on 24 July 1898) - becoming the first abbot of the monastery since the French Revolution and its first regular abbot since the 16th century. Cardinal Guillaume Sourrieu, Archbishop of Rouen and Primate of Normandy, assisted by the abbots of Solesmes and Ligug√© as co-consecrators, conferred the abbatial blessing upon him on 29 September 1898, in the presence of three other prelates and 150 priests. Following the French \\"Association Laws\\" against religious congregations passed by Minister Waldeck-Rousseau, Dom Pothier moved from France to Belgium with his exiled community in 1901. Music A musicologist, disciple and collaborator of Dom Prosper Gu√©ranger, Dom Pothier contributed to the reconstitution, the restoration and the renewal of the Gregorian chant, a form of monophonic, unaccompanied sacred song of the Roman Catholic Church. Besides being the composer of many Gregorian songs (Officium Defunctorum, 1887) and the writer of a huge number of articles, Dom Pothier was also the head and editor of the Revue du Chant Gr√©gorien (1892‚Äì1914) - supervising the publication of several works (Hymnes, Christmas office, Antifonario, Cantus mariales) -, the founder of the Pal√©ographie Musicale publication for the dissemination of medieval liturgical manuscripts, and the author of a new edition of the choir books based on manuscripts of the Gregorian chant and of several studies on the plainchant, including Les m√©lodies gr√©goriennes d'apr√®s la tradition (Gregorian Melodies According to the Tradition), 1880, his chief work which became the standard work on the subject. Dom Pothier was appointed president of the newly created Pontifical Commission on the Vatican Edition of the Gregorian Liturgical Books by Pope Pius X in 1904. As chairman of this commission for the reconstitution of the music of the Roman Catholic Mass, Dom Pothier lived in Rome from 1904 till 1913. His Liber Gradualis, 1883, marked the beginning of a reform in liturgical chant and was used as a basis for the Gradual Vatican which was published, under his responsibility, in 1908. Dom Pothier died at the old priory of Conques, Belgium in 1923; the Bishop of Luxembourg and six prelates attended his funeral at Clervaux abbey, Luxembourg (his remains later were transferred to Saint-Wandrille in 1962). The exiled community of St Wandrille's Abbey, under Dom Pothier as Abbot, founded in 1912 a new priory in Canada, Saint Benedict Abbey, Quebec, which later became independent within the Solesmes Congregation.

Early years Born in Champaign, Illinois, Clayton attended St. Elizabeth's school in Chicago.> Career Clayton debuted on stage as a professional as a member of the chorus in a production at the Chicago Opera House. After that, she worked with stock theater companies in Milwaukee and Minneapolis. On stage, Clayton appeared mainly in musicals or musical revues such as The Ziegfeld Follies of 1911. In addition to that production, her Broadway credits include Fancy Free (1918), You're in Love (1917), Nobody Home (1915), The Red Canary (1914), The Brute (1912), and His Name on the Door (1909). Clayton's first film was When the Earth Trembled. Following appearances on screen in short dramas from 1909 to 1912, she made her feature- length film debut in For the Love of a Girl in 1912. Barry O'Neil directed the film, and Clayton later was directed by William Demille, Robert G. Vignola, George Melford and Donald Crisp in subsequent feature films. Like many silent film actors, Clayton's career was hurt by the coming of sound to motion pictures. She continued her career in small parts in films until she retired in 1948. Personal life In 1931, Clayton obtained a California Superior Court order enjoining her former business partner, W.L. Rucker, from disposing of 316 pearls.The New York Times, \\"Sues For 316 Pearls\\", March 26, 1931, Page 56. Clayton and Rucker agreed to purchase a cosmetics business and the pearls had been entrusted to Rucker to raise money. The deal fell through and he refused to return the jewels. Rucker admitted to possessing the pearls but claimed they had been pledged as security for a $125 loan. The pearls were valued at $20,000. =Marriages= Clayton was first married to actor-director Joseph Kaufman until his death in 1918 in the Spanish flu epidemic. She later married silent film actor and former star Ian Keith twice and they divorced twice. In both cases Clayton cited cruelty and excessive drinking. Clayton and Keith were first married in Minneapolis in 1928 and first separated on January 13, 1931. Death Ethel Clayton died on June 6, 1966 at Guardian Convalescent Hospital in Oxnard, California, aged 83. She was buried at Ivy Lawn Memorial Park in Ventura, California.

It is part of the Sierra Gorda region with about eighty percent of the territory belonging to the Sierra Gorda Biosphere of Quer√©taro. The municipality is on the southwest side of the Sierra Gorda, the highest mountains of which block most of the moisture coming in from the Gulf of Mexico. For this reason, most of the territory is arid, part of what is called the Quer√©taro ‚Äúsemi-desert‚Äù filled with cactus. There is a small portion on the far east side which has temperate forests and bodies of water, mostly related to the Extoraz River, in which fish are raised. The name of the town and municipality comes from a mountain called ‚ÄúEl Picacho‚Äù but reminded town founder Jos√© de Escand√≥n of the Pe√±a Mellera in Spain. Over time, the name morphed into Pe√±amiller. The town The town of Pe√±amiller is a small community of less than 1,100 as of 2005, located in the west of the municipality at an altitude of 1330 meters. The town is wedged between mountains and the banks of the Extoraz River. It was founded and named by Jos√© de Escand√≥n in the middle of the 18th century. He named it Pe√±a Mellera as the mountain now known as Picacho just east of the town reminded him of a similar formation in the Pe√±amellera Bajo in Spain. Inside and just outside the town there are many walnut trees. Just further out there are many tall cactus and buzzards can frequently be seen circling in the air riding on warm air currents. Many of the town's roads are still dirt. The main church building dates from the 19th century and the municipal palace building is one of the oldest in the town. The municipal seat has one public library called the Biblioteca P√∫blica Municipal Lic. Benito Ju√°rez. It offers lending of books with home delivery, research help, guided tours, story hours for children and digital services. The most important local religious event occurs on 15 August, when the Our Lady of the Assumption is venerated. This event lasts eight days and includes pilgrimages, masses, dances, novenas and fireworks. The next most important are the events associated with the Christmas season. The annual Passion Play has been held since 1880 with the participation of at least fifty actors each year. It is held on the streets of the town, especially where there are shady walnut trees ending at the Cerro del Calvario were the crucifixion in enacted. The Feria de la Nuez, dedicated to the Archangel Michael, is held on the 29th of September. This event include sporting events, traditionals as jaripeos, a coronation of a queen and popular dance. Handcrafts produced in the town include a tool called a guingaro, used to accomplish much of the work in the fields. They also made embroidered belts (called pitiados) as well as reed baskets and brooms and a type of overcoat. Environment The municipality is located in the north of the state, in the Quer√©taro semi desert area. It is considered to be the gateway to the Sierra Gorda in Quer√©taro. Eighty percent of the municipality belongs to the Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve of Quer√©taro. The territory is very rugged with altitudes varying from between 1,280 and 3000 masl. The most important elevations include El Cerro del Pi√±on at 3000 masl, Mesa de Salinas at 2460masl, El Campanario at 2120 masl, La Tembladera at 2080 masl, El Piloncito at 1980 masl, El Cerro de Dios at 1900 masl and El Picacho at 1680masl. The municipality in the Extor√°z River basin, which receives rainfall over a surface of 2,149 km2 and results in a river that moves 1,150,000m3 of water each year. This river is the main one in the municipality, and has carved out a large canyon called the Ca√±on del Para√≠so (Paradise Canyon), located three km west of the town of Pe√±amiller. This canyon is barely ten meters wide, but it is 700 meters long with sides of black marble up to one hundred feet high. There are some caves and other capricious forms on the canyon walls, as well as petroglyphs and cave paintings done by ancient Chichimecas. The area has hiking trails with signs, mountain climbing, rappelling and camping. The cave paintings of Del Sol and De la Luna are also located along the Extoraz River, ten km off of Highway 120, next to the community of El Mirador. The sun image measures approximately one meter in diameter and the moon image about sixty cm. These paintings are found on the south side of a large hill which is situation over an even large one and has a natural opening similar to a window. During part of the year, the sun's rays pass directly through the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù onto the sun image. The only other surface water is the Saucello, Los Encinos, Higuerillas and Del Buey arroyos, which generally do not flow during the dry season from March to June. The climate is dry and semi-hot with an average annual temperature of 22C. Winters are distinguishable and freezes occur on occasion. The hottest months are from May to August when temperatures can rise to up to 40C. The average temperature year round is 21.7C. Annual precipitation, mostly restricted to the rainy season in late summer and early fall is about 435mm. The lowest areas, between 1200 and 1400masl has the driest climate with an average rainfall of about 300 to 400 mm yearly. Temperatures range from 2 to 35C with an average temperature of 22C. Winters are well defined and freezes appear about once every ten years. Between 1500 and 1800 masl, the conditions begin to change from semi desert to temperate forest. Temperatures vary from -3 to 35C with an average of 20C. Between 2000 and 3000masl, temperatures vary from -5 to 25C and rainfall of between 500 and 600mm. The municipality experiences about sixty cloudy days each year. Most of the vegetation consists of mesquite (prosopis spp) along with some pine-holm oak forest in the east and desert scrub brush on the extreme south. Other plants that can be found in the municipality include palo bobo (Tessaria integrifolia), u√±a de gato, huisache (Vachellia farnesiana), granjeno, palo sishote as well as nopal, wild oregano and barrel cactus. Wildlife is mostly limited to that which can live in arid conditions such as doves, turtledoves, quail, rabbits, squirrels, skunks, weasels, cacomistle, raccoons, badgers, coyotes, foxes, armadillos and various types of snakes including the coral snake and the rattlesnake. In the La Higuera and R√≠o Blanco rivers there are various types of fish such as trout, tilapia, catfish and carp. In the forested areas, there are white-tailed deer, temazate (Mazama temama), wild boar, and pumas. The Tembladera Lookout Point is situated on the side of Highway 120. The site allows for views of ‚Äúbiznaga‚Äù cactus which grow to up to 2.3 meters in height as well as views of mountains such as the Cerro de Media Luna, Cerro de la Virgen, El Picacho, Cerro el Capanario as well as the Del Paraiso Canyon, and the Extor√°z River. Demographics and culture The military campaigns of the mid 18th century wiped out most of the Chichimecas except for some small communities. Otomi families were brought into the area into settlements such as El Para√≠so, Adjuntas de Higueras, La Higuera, El Puerto de la Guitarra, Agua del √Ångel, El Pil√≥n La Tinaja, El Carrizal and La Mesa del Troje. However, at their peak they only numbered about 550 inhabitants. Since that time, most of these small groups assimilated into the mainstream culture, losing the Otomi language and many emigrated out of the area, especially in the 20th century. As of the 2005 census, only fifty people who spoke an indigenous language at all lived in the municipality. About 6% of the municipality's population was Otomi in 1900, but near zero now. The population in 2000 was 16,557 distributed in 136 small communities, with about 95 percent considered to be rural. There were 17,007 in 2005. Ninety eight percent of the municipality is Catholic divided into four parishes, Santa Maria Pe√±amiller, San Miguel Palmas, San Jos√© Pinal de Amoles and Atargea in Guanajuato. In the past, families were large with up to twelve children but in the 20th century, family planning campaigns have brought that average down to 5.6. Pe√±amiller has one of the highest rates of single mothers in the state. The municipality has the highest rate of maternal mortality with an average of 20.6 deaths per 10,000 live births. The state average is 4.1. Because of the lack of employment, there is mass emigration from the area. Most rural people migrate to larger cities in Mexico or to the United States and many never return. During the last decades of the 20th and the first years of the 21st, the municipality has had about 3,500 people leave to find work and about 130 on average never return. Popular traditional musical styles include corrido and huapango, with a number of locally notable bands such as those led by Catarino Albarr√°n, Gerardo Hern√°ndez and Lidio Albarr√°n. Locally popular corridos include those dedicated to Taurino L√≥pez and Genaro Hern√°ndez. Huapango is most often placed for traditional festivities. The cuisine of the area is traditional Mexican cuisine adapted to the food products of the Quer√©taro semi-desert area. A number of cactus and succulent species are eaten including Agave americana, the flowers of the yucca plant, garambullo (Myrtillocactus geometrizans), nopal and sotol (Dasylirion texanum). Insects such as escamoles, tantarrias (an insect which lives in mesquite trees) and maguey worms (larvae) are also eaten. Escamoles and maguey worms are often eaten mixed together. Goat meat is popular as it is relatively easy to raise in the harsh climate. The most representative dish of the area is ‚Äúchivo tapiado‚Äù, which is goat meat accompany by wild vegetables in season, especially various types of cactus. In the river areas, a number of fish species and caught and grown including trout, tilapia, catfish and carp. History Adobe facade The name was originally Pe√±amellera, given by Jos√© de Escand√≥n, as the mountain formation east of town reminded him of a similar formation in Asturias, Spain in the Pe√±amellera Baja. It was officially named Santa Mar√≠a de Pe√±amillera when the area became a sub prefecture of Tolim√°n. Eventually, the name morphed to what it is today. The municipality's coat of arms represents the history and traditions of the area, especially those related to the founding of the Spanish town in 1748 and after. Since it was the 18th century, the sun figure has eighteen rays. Another motif is that of a colonizer subjugating an indigenous person to represent the conquest of the Chichimecas. As thirty seven families moved in to found the town, there are thirty seven marked tombs, and a tree represents the distribution of lands. Eight palms in a walnut tree branch represent the most important annual celebration, that of the Virgin of the Assumption on August 15. The parish church is represented, and the mass of foundation is represented by a cross at the top of the coat of arms. The area which is now Pe√±amiller has been inhabited for more than 2000 years, which is shown in part by the petroglyphs where have been found along the Extoraz River. More artwork painted or chiseled in rock formations are found in de R√≠o Blanco, El Soyatal, El Mirador, El Puerto del Cobre, La Mesa de los Chilitos, La Cueva del Caballo, and La Cruz del Milagro. In the pre Classic period, the area was dominated by the Serrana Culture, the same culture that built the sites of Las Ranas and Toluquillo. From this culture there are remains such as ceramic figures found in La Plazuela, Camargo and Alto Bonito, which date from the 7th century. These objects show Toltec influence. There also have been pre Hispanic tools likely related to mining found in the area, especially around Soyatal. Mining mostly focused on the extraction of mercury and cinnabar, with the latter extensively commercialized from 800 to 900 CE. The Pames arrived in the 13th century and mostly settled in the area around San Miguel Palmas. The Chichimeca Jonaz arrived in the 14th century and mainly settled in Tembladera, El Portugu√©s and the areas around the Extoraz River and the Cerro de Media Luna, in the east where the land is less arid. The first Spanish in the region were led by Nicol√°s de San Luis Monta√±ez in the mid 16th century. Because of their battles with the Chichimecas, San Luis Monta√±ez was named ‚ÄúCapitan of the Chichimecas.‚Äù The Pames did not offer much resistance to Spanish incursion but the Chichimeca Jonaz did. In Pame lands, the San Miguel Palmas mission was founded relatively early, in 1691, when the indigenous peoples there requested that a priest be sent to them for evangelization purposes. It was abandoned briefly for unknown reasons in 1684. The mission church was completed in 1723. R√≠o Blanco was founded as a mining camp in 1691 when deposits of mercury, silver, gold and water for processing were found by the Spanish. However, Pe√±amiller and the rest of the Sierra Gorda of Quer√©taro were not subdued and settled until the expedition of Jos√© de Escand√≥n in the mid 18th century, culminating in the defeat of the Chichimeca Jonaz and allies at the Battle of Media Luna (in neighboring Pinal de Amoles) in 1748. The municipal seat was founded in 1748, at first with a military aim of a fortress against the scattered Chichimecas who had escaped the Battle of Media Luna. Soldiers and families were located strategically; both against the remaining Chichimecas and to make sure the indigenous among them did not rebel. This totaled thirty soldiers with their families along with one hundred others under the command of Captain Joseph Antonio Diaz Maldonado. A presidio was established as a sub prefecture of the district of Tolim√°n. The official foundation ceremony included a mass officiated by Friar Tomas Aquino Ramirez de Prado, and declared as the Villa de Pe√±a Millera de la Santisima Virgen de la Asunci√≥n. The new settlement was traced out with a plaza, a church, monastery cemetery and gardens on the north side with lands partitioned out on the other sides. In addition, four official pasturelands for cattle were marked off in each of the cardinal directions. In 1825, the presidio became a Franciscan mission under the direction of San Pedro and San Pablo of Michoac√°n. By this time, the town has grown sufficiently that there were a number of large mansion homes, the most prominent belonging to Juan S√°nchez, Luis Olvera, Lamberto Rodr√≠guez, Aurora Requena and Alicia S√°nchez. With the declaration of the first state constitution, Pe√±amiller belonged to the district of Tolim√°n, under the name of Santa Mar√≠a Pe√±a Millera. Sometime from then to the present the named changed permanently to the current form, with ‚ÄúPe√±amiller‚Äù first showing up in records as early as 1833. The last battle of the Rebellion of the Sierra Gorda was fought here in 1849. Eleuterio Quiroz, a principle leader of the movement, was captured by General Tomas Mej√≠a and made a prisoner, then executed by firing squad. The body was embalmed, taken to Pinar de San Agust√≠n and hung by the government as an example. During the government of Porfirio D√≠az, a number of men amassed large estates and fortunes. In Pe√±amiller, the largest landholder was Rafael Olvera, who was cacique of all the Sierra Gorda and the richest man in Quer√©taro at that time. He was also governor from 1883 to 1887. His two main properties in Pe√±amiller were the Boquillas and Extoraz Haciendas, the latter the largest in the state at 41,036 hectares. During the Mexican Revolution in 1916, Pe√±amiller was separated from the district of Tolim√°n and joined to the municipality of Col√≥n. Pe√±amiller was recognized as a town in 1917, under its modern name in 1917. In the same year, it was made part of the Col√≥n municipality then back to Tolim√°n. The area was affected by a severe flu epidemic in 1918. From 1918 to 1920, the parish church of Santa Mar√≠a de la Asunci√≥n was remodeled and redecorated. In 1924, its status as a community in the municipality of Tolim√°n was reaffirmed. Much of the land from the haciendas were broken up from 1915 to 1930 and made into communally held lands called ejidos. While the initial declarations were made in 1915, their implementation was delayed until 1930. These ejidos include Extortas, Rio Blanco, Las Enramadas, Pe√±a Blanco, San Lorenzo, La Plazuela, Maguey Verde, El Pil√≥n, Los Encinos, Agua Fria, Molinitos de Orozco, El Portugues, Camargo, La Higuera, El Tequizquite and San Isidro Boquillas. In 1936, much of the Pe√±amiller area was reformed as the Villa Zapata delegation of the municipality of Tolim√°n. In 1936, a rebel group led by Taurino L√≥pez burned the municipal archives of Pe√±amiller. However, this rebel leader was found the next day hanged. The main church of the town of Pe√±amiller became a parish in 1937, and then it was named as head of its own municipality in 1941. The tower of the parish church was built in 1955. Highway 120 was built through the municipality in the 1960s, but it was not paved until 1980. Basic modern infrastructure such as running water, electricity and a health center were constructed in 1962, but only in the municipal seat. A dirt road connecting the municipal seat with Tolim√°n was built in 1972. From 1960 to 1970, mining was at its height in the municipality with 128 mines extracting mostly mercury. However, mercury prices crashed in the 1970s and the boom ended. The municipal palace, an auditorium, a sports facility and a medical clinic were built in the mid-1980s. The parish church was remodeled again in the 1990s, with support from state and municipal authorities. At the same time, a ‚Äúteatro del pueblo‚Äù or people's theatre was constructed for social and religious events as well as sports. In 1994, the Colegio de Estudios Cient√≠ficos y Tecnol√≥gicos del Estado de Quer√©taro, Pe√±amiller Campus was established, starting with 58 students. Distance high school education was begun in the rural delegation of Camargo. A similar program was installed in the San Miguel Palmas delegation in 2002. In 1998, Marcio Antonio Morales Sanchez was named the first ‚Äúchild municipal president‚Äù for Children's day on 30 April, a tradition which has been repeated since. During the first decade of the 21st century, there were a number of remodeling projects on the facades of the historic center of the municipal seat, including the Santa Mar√≠a de la Asunci√≥n Church. During the latter 2000s, Pe√±amiller and the rest of the Sierra Gorda experienced a number of small earthquakes, in an area which is not prone to seismic activity. A large number of these small quakes were felt from the latter part of 2010 to the first months of 2011. A number of communities including Villa Emiliano Zapata, San Juanico, El Alamo and Pe√±amiller have reported smelling sulfur and other foul odors and seeing vapor in connection with the quakes. As of January 2011, over fifty small quakes have been reported in Pe√±amiller alone, but the cause of the quakes is not known. However, none of the recorded events have been over 3 on the Richter scale so far. The Instituto de Geociencias of UNAM and the state of Quer√©taro have been investigating the seismic activity. Seismic activity monitors has been placed in various areas of the municipality by UNAM, and the state installed ten others at a cost of US$170 million. As Pe√±amiller has a mining past, there have been problems with pollution associated with the mines, many of which are abandoned. In 2007, residents of the municipality protested to authorities about the quality of water coming from two wells on which depend about 3,000 people. The water has tested positive for lead and magnesium for at least twenty years and the problem is worse during the rainy season. On occasion the contamination during this season is such that the water comes out brown due to sediment. The mineral contamination is due to abandoned mercury mines in the area. Then municipal president Juan Manuel Garc√≠a Leal admitted that at least 5,000 people in eight communities drink and otherwise use water contaminated with magnesium and other minerals. Another source of contamination are the pipes used to transport the water, however the municipality does not have the resources to replace the system. Pe√±amiller is one of the municipalities in the Sierra Gorda with high rates of migration to the United States, due to economic marginalization. This has led to a significant loss of students in the public schools, who generally accompany their parents when they move out. Economy About 21% of the total population is economically active. About thirty four percent of the working population is dedicated to agriculture, livestock, forestry, fishing and hunting. 1,045 hectares of land are dedicated to irrigated farming, with 916 farmed only during the rainy season. The rest, about 70,000 is left wild due to its dryness. Irrigated land is limited to those closest to the Extor√°z River and orchards that produce avocados, guavas, cherimoya, peaches, pomegranates, figs, limes, lemons, mangos, oranges, nuts, papayas and more. The most profitable crop is nuts, including pecans and pine nuts, although the amount produced each year can vary. However, there is a total of fifty three products grown with significant harvest. Pine nuts, avocado and Mexican plums are grown at the Maguey Verde, La Higuera, Camargo, Los Encinos, R√≠o Blanco, Agua Fr√≠a and Molinitos ejidos. There is relatively little livestock raised due to the harshness of the land, but most of the livestock is pigs followed by goats. There are 54,895 hectares used as natural pasture with 79 hectares are seeded. There are about 20,000 hectares of forest which can be cut and include species such as pine, oyamel, juniper, white cedar and red cedar, oak, poplar, strawberry trees, mesquite and more. In areas without logging, there are a number of species of plants with medicinal properties, including wild oregano, cat's claws and more, which produce a harvest of about 500 tons per year. Wild foodstuffs include maguey, nopal cactus, pitayo fruit, yuccas and more, which usually give a more abundant harvest once every four years. Wild herbs area generally harvested between August and November. Another product is the production of willow branches, which is supplied as raw material to communities such as Tequisquiapan for crafts. Mining, construction, and industry employ about twenty three percent of the population. Industry is mostly limited to the production of clothes in small workshops in Camargo, Los Encinos, San Lorenzo, Las Enramadas, La Vega, Pe√±amiller and La Misi√≥n de Palmas, employing just over two hundred people. There is also a workshop in La Misi√≥n de Palmas that makes sandals with tire tread soles that employs twenty five people. Soccer balls stitched by hand are made by about 350 people working at home in about twenty communities, mostly by women and school-aged children to allow them to earn money without leaving home to supplement family income. Local handcrafts include belts decorated with a type of embroidery. Various articles are made with willow branches such as baskets and hats, mostly made in San Lorenzo and Villa Emiliano Zapata and sold in Tequisquiapan. Rope is made in Las Mesas, El Cobre, Agua de Pedro, Puerto de Ojo de Agua and Aposentos, with items such as baskets and brooms made from reeds in the municipal seat. There are various mineral deposits in the municipality with mercury having been the most extracted. There were 128 mines during the 1960s and early 1970s, but the demand for mercury steeply declined after the Vietnam War. There are still small deposits of gold, silver, copper, zinc antimony and bauxite. There are stone quarries which produce marble, onyx, and sandstone in various colors. About sixteen percent of the population is dedicated to commerce and services. Commerce is mostly limited to basic needs for the local population, including tianguis held in seven communities during the week. There is no municipal market. There are also eight businesses dedicated to buying forest products. The Sierra Gorda region has been promoted for tourism, especially ecotourism in recent decades. Pe√±amiller is promoted as the gateway to this region. There are some guest houses and other facilities for tourism. The Mesa del Sombrerete Ecotourism Center is located seven km from the R√≠o Blanco River which is mostly dedicated to camping. It has cabins, restaurant, and hiking. El Oasis is a water park which obtains its water from a fresh water spring, which are propelled 200 meters into the main pool by the force of gravity. It is located in the Higueras Arroyo, surrounded by tall mountains. The tallest is the Cerro de la Virgen, which has a rock crag as a lookout point. The park offers camping and the park's pools and other attractions are filled with water from clear waters from a spring 200 meters away. These waters are also bottled and sold with the brand name ‚ÄúPe√±a Miller.‚Äù The facility also has a restaurant, multi use sports field, tanks for fish and cabins. The R√≠o Blanco River area marks the boundary between the forested and semi desert areas of the municipality. It is home to Ecoalbergue R√≠o Blanco, which is an ecotourism facility. Activities include camping, cave exploring, canyon exploring, visiting fresh water springs and abandoned mines and hiking. Transportation The town of Pe√±amiller is connected by highway to the state capital, San Juan del R√≠o and Xilitla. The municipality has 61 km of paved highway, 276 km of dirt roads and 52 km of dirt paths. All communities except for La Tinaja are connected by one of these three types of roads. There is public bus service between the municipal seat and Quer√©taro, Mexico City, Guadalajara, El Guam√∫chil, Atarjea, San Miguel Palmas Molinitos, Villa Emiliano Zapata, Pe√±a Blanca, La Higuera, El Saucito and Las Mesas. For transportation to other communities in the municipality, there are about twenty pickup trucks which function as communal taxis.

Although after the partition of India most of the families have either migrated to Pakistan or the other Indian Cities like Lucknow, Hyderabad etc., the sheen of the Moharram commemoration did not come to an end and Bilgramis commemorate it for two months and eight days. One of the important contributions of Moharram is that during this period Sayyid families return to Bilgram from every nook and corner of India to pay homage to the supreme scarifies of Imam Hussain. Important dates of Moharram Commemorations are 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th of Moharram. beside these dates Chehllum, Bahattar Tabut and Chup Tazia are very famous functions where hundreds of people congregate to pay homage to the martyrs of Karbala.

He played for the New York Highlanders, Cleveland Naps and Boston Red Sox from 1907 to 1913. Although his primary position was shortstop, Ball played at second base, third base and in the outfield as well. He is most famous for being the first player to turn an unassisted triple play in Major League Baseball history on July 19, 1909. Ball played minor league baseball for the Montgomery Senators of the Southern League until 1907, when he signed for the New York Highlanders. After spending less than three seasons with the organization, Ball was sold to the Cleveland Naps, where he spent the next two seasons. In the middle of the 1912 season, his contract was then purchased by the Boston Red Sox, with whom he played his last game on June 30, 1913. He died on October 15, 1957, in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Personal life Ball was born on April 22, 1881, in Grand Haven, Michigan. After his Major League career ended, he went on to coach the Baltimore Orioles (who were a minor league team at the time). It was there that he was assigned to train Babe Ruth, who had just come out of St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys. Ball described Ruth as \\"the dumbest and yet the strongest player\\" he had ever coached. The two remained good friends after Ruth broke into the Majors and even played a friendly game of bowling against one another in 1923 (with Ball edging out Ruth, winning four out of the seven games played). Ruth held Ball in great respect, and because of their close friendship in baseball, he eventually became a fan of the New York Yankees. In the 1950s, an annual bowling tournament held at the Newfield Alleys near Bridgeport, Connecticut was named after Ball in order to honor the city's famous inhabitant. On February 12, 1952, at the age of 71, his health severely deteriorated due to a heart ailment and he was rushed to Bridgeport Hospital, where he was placed on the danger list and visitors were prohibited from seeing him. He died on October 15, 1957 and was interred at Mountain Grove Cemetery, Bridgeport. Professional career =Minor leagues= Ballstarted playing organized baseball on the semi-pro team in Three Rivers, Michigan, where he played in a game against Hall of Fame Negro League star Rube Foster of the Otsego Independents during the 1902 season. He then proceeded to play for Montgomery Senators, a minor league baseball team that competed in the Southern League. He played for the team until , when he signed for the New York Highlanders. He made his major league debut for the Highlanders on September 12, 1907, at the age of 26, in a 2‚Äì0 loss against the Washington Senators. =New York Highlanders (1907‚Äì09)= During his rookie season, Ball posted a batting average of .247 and led the Majors in strikeouts with 91. Defensively, he committed the most errors among all fielders in the American League with 81 and most errors by a shortstop with 80, both of which are Yankee rookie records that still stand today. However, he also set the team record for most assists by a rookie with 438 (this record has since been broken by Derek Jeter, who had 444 assists in ). On May 18, , in the middle of the season, Ball was bought by the Cleveland Naps for approximately $5,000 ($ in current dollar terms). =Cleveland Naps (1909‚Äì12)= Ball was brought in to serve as the temporary replacement for Cleveland's injured starting shortstop Terry Turner, who suffered from a recurring arm injury that needed treatment. In his first season with the Indians, Ball batted .256 with one home run and 25 runs batted in. Although he was never famous for his defensive skills, he achieved baseball history when he executed the first unassisted triple play in the MLB on July 19, 1909, doing so against the Boston Red Sox at League Park. In the second inning of the game, Ball, playing shortstop, caught Amby McConnell's line drive, stepped on second base to retire Heinie Wagner, and then tagged outfielder Jake Stahl as he was advancing towards second. Because the play was unprecedented and turned so swiftly, the ballplayers on the field did not know the inning was over and the crowd of 11,000 were unsure of how to react. Cy Young, the game's starting pitcher, was puzzled and asked Ball why he was leaving the field. Once the fans in attendance realized what had happened, they gave him an ovation, while his teammates applauded him as he returned to the dugout. In the following inning, with the crowd still cheering, he hit an inside-the-park home run into center field (the only home run he hit that season). After the game, he was questioned in a post-game interview, a rare occurrence at the time. He remained humble about the feat and reminded the reporters that \\"anyone could have made the play\\". The glove that he used to make the unassisted triple play is on exhibit at the Baseball Hall of Fame. At the end of the season, after playing just 54 games with the team, Ball was sent down and released to the Portland Beavers. He refused to play for the minor league team and this, coupled with the underperformance of the infielders brought in to replace him, resulted in the Naps repurchasing his contract. The season turned out to be Ball's best statistical year, resulting in several career high numbers being set. He batted .296 and amassed 122 hits, 9 triples, 45 RBI and hit 3 home runs, though he also recorded the third highest number of strikeouts in the AL with 93. Although his defense was never stellar, he executed two noted plays that season. He made a one-handed stop against the Chicago White Sox that was described as \\"marvelous\\" by The New York Times and held the Yankees (his former team) to a 3‚Äì3 draw when Ball, serving as the cut-off man, successfully relayed the ball thrown from right fielder Shoeless Joe Jackson to catcher Gus Fisher. In doing so, he nailed Birdie Cree (who represented the Yankees' winning run) at home plate and the game was immediately suspended due to darkness. However, in a rematch against the White Sox on May 5, 1912, Ball suffered a momentary defensive lapse that ultimately cost his team the game. In the sixth inning, he was unable to catch Shano Collins stealing second base and then inexplicably held onto the ball. This allowed Ping Bodie to advance to home plate and score the winning run. On June 25, the Boston Red Sox purchased Ball's contract from the Naps for $2,500 ($ in today's dollars). =Boston Red Sox (1912‚Äì13)= Ball's final major league team was ironically the one he turned his unassisted triple play against. The player who was final out of that play, Jake Stahl, became his manager and teammate. The Red Sox signed Ball with the intention of using him only as a utility player who would be a competent substitute to any injured players on the team. As a result, he rarely started a game for the Red Sox. The team advanced to the World Series at the end of that season, where they defeated the New York Giants 4‚Äì3. Although he struck out in his only plate appearance of the series, he still received the prize money of $4,025 ($) rewarded to players on the winning team. This prompted the Ottawa Citizen to label him \\"the luckiest man in baseball.\\" Post-playing career After playing his final major league season in , Ball returned to minor league baseball and played for several teams until . Most notably, in May , he was traded by the Toronto Maple Leafs to his hometown team, the Bridgeport Hustlers of the Eastern League, and became both their manager and second baseman. The Hustlers were struggling at the time and the addition of Ball did nothing to change the team's fortunes. By July, the Hustlers were still languishing in last place and, as a result, he was dismissed from the team.

The commonly cited names of the eight fictional reindeer are Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donder and Blitzen, although Donder is often called Donner. They are based on those used in the 1823 poem \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\\" (commonly called \\"The Night Before Christmas\\") by Clement Clarke Moore, arguably the basis of the reindeers' popularity.  Origins  In traditional lore, Santa Claus's sleigh is led by eight reindeer: Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donder (variously spelled Dunder and Donner) and Blitzen (variously spelled Blixen and Blixem). The enduring popularity of the 1949 Christmas song \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" has led to Rudolph often joining the list, bringing the number of Santa Claus's reindeer up to nine. = Single reindeer = Illustration to the first verse of \\"Old Santeclaus with Much Delight\\", 1821 The first reference to Santa's sleigh being pulled by a reindeer appears in \\"Old Santeclaus with Much Delight\\", an 1821 illustrated children's poem published in New York. The names of the author and the illustrator are not known. The poem, with eight colored lithographic illustrations, was published by William B. Gilley as a small paperback book entitled The Children's Friend: A New-Year's Present, to the Little Ones from Five to Twelve. = Eight reindeer = \\"A Visit From St. Nicholas\\", handwritten manuscript by Clement C. Moore The 1823 poem by Clement C. Moore \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\\" (also known as \\"'Twas the Night Before Christmas\\") is largely credited for the contemporary Christmas lore that includes eight named reindeer. The relevant segment of the poem reads: > When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, > but a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny rein-deer, > with a little old driver, so lively and quick, > I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick. > > More rapid than eagles his coursers they came, > And he whistled, and shouted, and call'd them by name: > \\"Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer, and Vixen! > \\"On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Dunder and Blixem! > > \\"To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! > \\"Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!\\" As dry leaves that before the > wild hurricane fly, > When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky; > So up to the house-top the coursers they flew, > In An American Anthology, 17871900, Edmund Clarence Stedman reprints the 1844 Clement C. Moore version of the poem, including the German spelling of \\"Donder and Blitzen,\\" rather than the original 1823 version using the Dutch spelling, \\"Dunder and Blixem\\". Both phrases translate as \\"Thunder and Lightning\\" in English, though German for \\"thunder\\" is now spelled Donner, and the Dutch words would now be spelled Donder and Bliksem. = L.

Frank Baum's story The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (1902) includes a list of ten reindeer, none of which match the names of the versions found in \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\\".

Claus gathers eight more reindeer, named in rhyming pairs: Racer and Pacer, Fearless and Peerless, Ready and Steady, Feckless and Speckless. By the time The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus was adapted into a television special in 1985, the producers had replaced Baum's ten reindeer with eight unnamed reindeer to make the special compatible with Moore's poem. = Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer = Rudolph's story was originally written in verse by Robert L. May for the Montgomery Ward chain of department stores in 1939, and published as a book to be given to children in the store at Christmas time. ‚Äì \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" (p. 3) According to this story, Rudolph's glowing red nose made him a social outcast among the other reindeer. Santa Claus's worldwide flight one year was imperiled by severe fog. Visiting Rudolph's house to deliver his presents, Santa observed Rudolph's glowing red nose in the darkened bedroom and decided to use him as a makeshift lamp to guide his sleigh. Rudolph accepted Santa's request to lead the sleigh for the rest of the night, and he returned home a hero for having helped Santa Claus. Appearances in popular media * In the 1947 film Miracle on 34th Street, Kris Kringle tells a shop worker that he has made a mistake with his reindeer, namely that he has mixed up Cupid and Blitzen, that Dasher should be on the sleigh drivers right hand side, and that Donner's antlers have got four points instead of three. * \\"Run Rudolph Run\\" (1958), recorded by Chuck Berry a popular Christmas-rock song about Rudolph. * The 1989 film Prancer concerns a young girl who finds an injured reindeer who she realizes is Prancer.

Reindeer introduced after Rudolph Popular culture has generally recognized Santa Claus as having nine reindeer‚ÄîMoore's eight, plus Rudolph‚Äîsince the mid-20th century. Other film, television, literary and musical works have introduced other reindeer that, in part because of intellectual property issues, have not been accepted in popular culture to the extent Rudolph has.

The term does not include live exhibitions like sex shows and striptease. The primary subjects of present-day pornographic depictions are pornographic models, who pose for still photographs, and pornographic actors who engage in filmed sex acts. Various groups within society have considered depictions of a sexual nature immoral, addictive, and noxious, labeling them pornographic, and attempting to have them suppressed under obscenity laws, censored or made illegal. Such grounds, and even the definition of pornography, have differed in various historical, cultural, and national contexts.H. Montgomery Hyde (1964), A History of Pornography: 1‚Äì26. Social attitudes towards the discussion and presentation of sexuality have become more tolerant in Western countries, and legal definitions of obscenity have become more limited, beginning in 1969 with Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, the first adult erotic film depicting explicit sexual intercourse to receive wide theatrical release in the United States. It was followed by the Golden Age of Porn (1969‚Äì1984), in which the best quality pornographic films became part of mainstream culture. A growing industry for the production and consumption of pornography developed in the latter half of the 20th century. The introduction of home video and the Internet saw a boom in the worldwide porn industry that generates billions of dollars annually. Commercialized pornography accounts for over US$2.5 billion in the United States alone, including the production of various media and associated products and services. The porn industry is between $10‚Äì$12 billion in the U.S. In 2006, the world pornography revenue was 97 billion dollars.[Last accessed on 2010 Nov 12] This industry employs thousands of performers along with support and production staff. It is also followed by dedicated industry publications and trade groups, award shows, as well as the mainstream press, private organizations (watchdog groups), government agencies, and political organizations. Videos involving non-consensual content and cybersex trafficking have been hosted on popular pornography sites in the 21st century. Etymology The word pornography was coined from the ancient Greek words (p√≥rnƒì \\"prostitute\\" and porne√≠a \\"prostitution\\"List of Greek words starting with œÄŒøœÅŒΩ- (porn-) on Perseus.), and (gr√°phein \\"to write or to record\\", derived meaning \\"illustration\\", as in \\"graph\\"), and the suffix -ŒØŒ± (-ia, meaning \\"state of\\", \\"property of\\", or \\"place of\\"), thus meaning \\"a written description or illustration of prostitutes or prostitution\\". No date is known for the first use of the word in Greek; the earliest attested, most related word one could find in Greek, is , pornogr√°phos, i.e. \\"someone writing about harlots\\", in the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus..

The word was originally introduced by classical scholars as \\"a bookish, and therefore nonoffensive, term for writing about prostitutes\\", but its meaning was quickly expanded to include all forms of \\"objectionable or obscene material in art and literature\\". As early as 1864, Webster's Dictionary defined the word bluntly as \\"a licentious painting\\". The more inclusive word erotica, sometimes used as a synonym for \\"pornography\\", is derived from the feminine form of the ancient Greek adjective (er≈çtik√≥s), derived from (√©r≈çs), which refers to lust and sexual love. Pornography is often abbreviated to porn or porno in informal language. History Attic red-figure kylix, c. 510 BC. Depictions of a sexual nature have existed since prehistoric times, as seen in the Venus figurines and rock art. A vast number of artifacts have been discovered from ancient Mesopotamia depicting explicit heterosexual sex. Glyptic art from the Sumerian Early Dynastic Period frequently shows scenes of frontal sex in the missionary position. In Mesopotamian votive plaques from the early second millennium BC, the man is usually shown entering the woman from behind while she bends over, drinking beer through a straw. Middle Assyrian lead votive figurines often represent the man standing and penetrating the woman as she rests on top of an altar. Scholars have traditionally interpreted all these depictions as scenes of ritual sex, but they are more likely to be associated with the cult of Inanna, the goddess of sex and prostitution. Many sexually explicit images were found in the temple of Inanna at Assur, which also contained models of male and female sexual organs. Depictions of sexual intercourse were not part of the general repertory of ancient Egyptian formal art, but rudimentary sketches of heterosexual intercourse have been found on pottery fragments and in graffiti. The final two thirds of the Turin Erotic Papyrus (Papyrus 55001), an Egyptian papyrus scroll discovered at Deir el-Medina, consist of a series of twelve vignettes showing men and women in various sexual positions. The scroll was probably painted in the Ramesside period (1292‚Äì1075 BC) and its high artistic quality indicates that it was produced for a wealthy audience. No other similar scrolls have yet been discovered. coitus more ferarum Fanny Hill (1748) is considered \\"the first original English prose pornography, and the first pornography to use the form of the novel.\\"Foxon, D.

The authors were charged with \\"corrupting the King's subjects.\\" When large-scale excavations of Pompeii were undertaken in the 1860s, much of the erotic art of the Romans came to light, shocking the Victorians who saw themselves as the intellectual heirs of the Roman Empire. They did not know what to do with the frank depictions of sexuality and endeavored to hide them away from everyone but upper-class scholars. The moveable objects were locked away in the Secret Museum in Naples and what could not be removed was covered and cordoned off as to not corrupt the sensibilities of women, children, and the working classes.Pornography: A Secret History of Civilisation, World of Wonder, Channel 4 Television Corporation, UK, 1999. Part 1. After the modern invention of photography, photographic pornography was also born. The parisian demimonde included Napoleon III's minister, Charles de Morny, who was an early patron that displayed photos at large gatherings. The world's first law criminalizing pornography was the English Obscene Publications Act 1857 enacted at the urging of the Society for the Suppression of Vice.Miriam A. Drake (2003). Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science: Abs-Dec. CRC Press. p. 470. . Retrieved 16 July. 2017 The Act, which applied to the United Kingdom and Ireland, made the sale of obscene material a statutory offence, giving the courts power to seize and destroy offending material. The American equivalent was the Comstock Act of 1873The Comstock Act which made it illegal to send any \\"obscene, lewd, and/or lascivious\\" materials through the mail. The English Act did not apply to Scotland, where the common law continued to apply. However, neither the English nor the United States Act defined what constituted \\"obscene\\", leaving this for the courts to determine. Before the English Act, the publication of obscene material was treated as a common law misdemeanourFrom the precedent set by R. v. Curl (1729) following the publication of Venus in the Cloister. and effectively prosecuting authors and publishers was difficult even in cases where the material was clearly intended as pornography. Although nineteenth-century legislation eventually outlawed the publication, retail, and trafficking of certain writings and images regarded as pornographic and would order the destruction of shop and warehouse stock meant for sale, the private possession of and viewing of (some forms of) pornography was not made an offence until the twentieth century.H. Montgomery Hyde A History of Pornography. (1969) London, Heinemann; p. 14. Historians have explored the role of pornography in social history and the history of morality.Judith Ann Giesberg, Sex and the Civil War: Soldiers, Pornography, and the Making of American Morality (U of North Carolina Press, 2017). The Victorian attitude that pornography was for a select few can be seen in the wording of the Hicklin test stemming from a court case in 1868 where it asks, \\"whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences.\\" Although they were suppressed, depictions of erotic imagery were common throughout history. Pornographic film production commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture in 1895. Two of the earliest pioneers were Eug√®ne Pirou and Albert Kirchner. Kirchner directed the earliest surviving pornographic film for Pirou under the trade name \\"L√©ar\\". The 1896 film Le Coucher de la Mari√©e showed Louise Willy performing a striptease. Pirou's film inspired a genre of risqu√© French films showing women disrobing and other filmmakers realised profits could be made from such films. Marquee at Pilgrim Theatre on Washington Street showing Dr. Sex (1964) Sexually explicit films opened producers and distributors to prosecution. Such films were produced illicitly by amateurs, starting in the 1920s, primarily in France and the United States. Processing the film was risky as was their distribution. Distribution was strictly private. In 1969, Denmark became the first country to abolish censorship, thereby decriminalizing pornography, which led to an explosion in investment and of commercially produced pornography. However, it continued to be banned in other countries, and had to be smuggled in, where it was sold \\"under the counter\\" or (sometimes) shown in \\"members only\\" cinema clubs. Nonetheless, and also in 1969, Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, was the first adult erotic film depicting explicit sexual intercourse to receive wide theatrical release in the United States. The film was a seminal film in the Golden Age of Porn and, according to Warhol, a major influence in the making of Last Tango in Paris, an internationally controversial erotic drama film, starring Marlon Brando, and released a few years after Blue Movie was made. A selection of pornographic magazines confiscated by customs authorities in 1969. porn actors preparing to shoot a scene for an adult film. Data from 2015 suggests an increase in pornography viewing over the past few decades, and this has been attributed to the growth of Internet pornography since widespread public access to the World Wide Web in the late 1990s. Through the 2010s, many pornographic production companies and top pornographic websites ‚Äì such as PornHub, RedTube and YouPorn ‚Äì were acquired by MindGeek, which has been described as \\"a monopoly\\". The scholarly study of pornography, notably in cultural studies, is limited, perhaps due to the controversy about the topic in feminism. The first peer-reviewed academic journal about the study of pornography, Porn Studies, was published in 2014. Classification Pornography is often distinguished from erotica, which consists of the portrayal of sexuality with high-art aspirations, focusing also on feelings and emotions, while pornography involves the depiction of acts in a sensational manner, with the entire focus on the physical act, so as to arouse quick intense reactions. Pornography is generally classified as either softcore or hardcore. A pornographic work is characterized as hardcore if it has any hardcore content, no matter how small. Both forms of pornography generally contain nudity. Softcore pornography generally contains nudity or partial nudity in sexually suggestive situations, but without explicit sexual activity, sexual penetration or \\"extreme\\" fetishism, while hardcore pornography may contain graphic sexual activity and visible penetration, including unsimulated sex scenes. =Subgenres= Pornography encompasses a wide variety of genres. Pornography featuring heterosexual acts composes the bulk of pornography and is \\"centred and invisible\\", marking the industry as heteronormative. However, a substantial portion of pornography is not normative, featuring more nonconventional forms of scenarios and sexual activity such as \\"'fat' porn, amateur porn, disabled porn, porn produced by women, queer porn, BDSM, and body modification.\\" Pornography can be classified according to the physical characteristics of the participants, fetish, sexual orientation, etc., as well as the types of sexual activity featured. Reality and voyeur pornography, animated videos, and legally prohibited acts also influence the classification of pornography. Pornography may fall into more than one genre. Some examples of pornography genres: * Alt porn * Amateur pornography * Bondage pornography * Ethnic pornography * Fetish pornography * Group sex * Reality pornography * Porn parody * Sexual-orientation-based pornography ** Straight porn ** Gay pornography ** Lesbian pornography ** Bisexual pornography *Transgender pornography Commercialism =Economics= Revenues of the adult industry in the United States are difficult to determine. In 1970, a Federal study estimated that the total retail value of hardcore pornography in the United States was no more than $10 million.President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. Report of The Commission on Obscenity and Pornography 1970, Washington, D.C.: U. S. Government Printing Office. In 1998, Forrester Research published a report on the online \\"adult content\\" industry estimating $750 million to $1 billion in annual revenue. Studies in 2001 put the total (including video, pay-per-view, Internet and magazines) between $2.6 billion and $3.9 billion. , the porn industry was believed to bring in more than $13 billion on a yearly basis in the United States. CNBC has estimated that pornography was a $13 billion industry in the US, with $3,075 being spent on porn every second and a new porn video being produced every 39 minutes. A significant amount of pornographic video is shot in the San Fernando Valley, which has been a pioneering region for producing adult films since the 1970s, and has since become home for various models, actors/actresses, production companies, and other assorted businesses involved in the production and distribution of pornography. The pornography industry has been considered influential in deciding format wars in media, including being a factor in the VHS vs. Betamax format war (the videotape format war) and in the Blu-ray vs. HD DVD format war (the high-def format war). Ron Wagner, Director of IT at a California porn studio: \\"If you look at the VHS vs. Beta standards, you see the much higher- quality standard dying because of [the porn industry's support of VHS]... The mass volume of tapes in the porn market at the time went out on VHS.\\" =Technology= Pornographers have taken advantage of each technological advance in the production and distribution of visual images. Pornography is considered a driving force in the development of technologies from the printing press, through photography (still and motion), to satellite TV, home video, other forms of video, and the Internet. With commercial availability of tiny cameras and wireless equipment, \\"voyeur\\" pornography established an audience. Mobile cameras are used to capture pornographic photos or videos, and forwarded as MMS, a practice known as sexting. Computer-generated images and manipulations Digital manipulation requires the use of source photographs, but some pornography is produced without human actors at all. The idea of completely computer-generated pornography was conceived very early as one of the most obvious areas of application for computer graphics and 3D rendering. Further advances in technology have allowed increasingly photorealistic 3D figures to be used in interactive pornography. Until the late 1990s, digitally manipulated pornography could not be produced cost- effectively. In the early 2000s, it became a growing segment, as the modelling and animation software matured and the rendering capabilities of computers improved. As of 2004, computer-generated pornography depicting situations involving children and sex with fictional characters, such as Lara Croft, is already produced on a limited scale. The October 2004 issue of Playboy featured topless pictures of the title character from the BloodRayne video game. 3D pornography The first pornographic film shot in 3D was 3D Sex and Zen: Extreme Ecstasy, released April 2011 in Hong Kong. =Production and distribution by region= A street stall in Hong Kong selling pornography. The production and distribution of pornography are economic activities of some importance. The exact size of the economy of pornography and the influence that it has in political circles are matters of controversy. In the United States, the sex film industry is centered in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. In Europe, Budapest is regarded as the industry center.‚ÄúStrange and wonderful‚Äù Budapest ‚Äî Where the living is increasingly pleasant... and still very cheap . Escapeartist.com (1989-09-11).

Study and analysis Research concerning the effects of pornography is concerned with multiple outcomes. Such research includes potential influences on rape, domestic violence, sexual dysfunction, difficulties with sexual relationships, and child sexual abuse. While some literature reviews suggest that pornographic images and films can be addictive, insufficient evidence exists to draw conclusions. Several studies conclude the liberalization of porn in society may be associated with decreased rape and sexual violence rates, while others suggest no effect, or are inconclusive. Pdf. Online. Pdf. Laws and regulations 300pxthumbleftWorld map of pornography (18+) laws The legal status of pornography varies widely from country to country. Most countries allow at least some form of pornography. In some countries, softcore pornography is considered tame enough to be sold in general stores or to be shown on TV. Hardcore pornography, on the other hand, is usually regulated. The production and sale, and to a slightly lesser degree the possession, of child pornography is illegal in almost all countries, and some countries have restrictions on pornography depicting violence, for example rape pornography or animal pornography. Pornographic entertainment on display in a sex shop window, where there is usually a minimum age to go into pornographic stores Most countries attempt to restrict minors' access to hardcore materials, limiting availability to sex shops, mail-order, and television channels that parents can restrict, among other means. There is usually an age minimum for entrance to pornographic stores, or the materials are displayed partly covered or not displayed at all. More generally, disseminating pornography to a minor is often illegal. Many of these efforts have been rendered practically irrelevant by widely available Internet pornography. A failed US law would have made these same restrictions apply to the internet. The adult film industry regulations in California require that all actors and actresses practice safe sex using condoms. It is rare to see condom use in pornography. Since porn does better when actors are unprotected, many companies film in other states. Miami is a major area for amateur porn. Twitter plays a big part in an actor's success: because Twitter does not censor content, actors can post freely without having to self-censor, unlike on Instagram and on Facebook. In the United States, a person receiving unwanted commercial mail he or she deems pornographic (or otherwise offensive) may obtain a Prohibitory Order, either against all mail from a particular sender, or against all sexually explicit mail, by applying to the United States Postal Service. There are recurring urban legends of snuff movies, in which murders are filmed for pornographic purposes. Despite extensive work to ascertain the truth of these rumors, law enforcement officials have not found any such works. Some people, including pornography producer Larry Flynt and the writer Salman Rushdie, have argued that pornography is vital to freedom and that a free and civilized society should be judged by its willingness to accept pornography. The UK government has criminalized possession of what it terms \\"extreme pornography\\", following the highly publicized murder of Jane Longhurst. Child pornography is illegal in most countries, with a person most commonly being a child until the age of 18 (though the age varies). In those countries, any film or photo that shows a child in a sexual act is considered pornography and illegal. Pornography can infringe into basic human rights of those involved, especially when sexual consent was not obtained. For example, revenge porn is a phenomenon where disgruntled sexual partners release images or video footage of intimate sexual activity, usually on the internet, without authorization from the other person. Lawmakers have also raised concerns about \\"upskirt\\" photos taken of women without their consent. In many countries there has been a demand to make such activities specifically illegal carrying higher punishments than mere breach of privacy or image rights, or circulation of prurient material. As a result, some jurisdictions have enacted specific laws against \\"revenge porn\\". =What is not pornography= In the U.S., a July 2014 criminal case decision in Massachusetts, Commonwealth v. Rex, 469 Mass. 36 (2014), made a legal determination of what was not to be considered \\"pornography\\" and in this particular case \\"child pornography\\". It was determined that photographs of naked children that were from sources such as National Geographic magazine, a sociology textbook, and a nudist catalog were not considered pornography in Massachusetts even while in the possession of a convicted and (at the time) incarcerated sex offender. Drawing the line depends on time and place; Occidental mainstream culture got increasingly \\"pornified\\" (i.e. tainted by pornographic themes and mainstream films got to include unsimulated sexual acts). =Copyright status= In the United States, some courts have applied US copyright protection to pornographic materials.Gouss√©, Caroline (2012-02-16). \\"No Copyright Protection for Pornography: A Daring Response to File-Sharing Litigation\\". Intellectual Property Brief. Retrieved 2012-03-01.Masnick, Mike (2011-11-04). \\"Court Wonders If Porn Can Even Be Covered By Copyright\\". Tech Dirt. Retrieved 2012-03-01. Although the first US copyright law specifically did not cover obscene materials, the provision was removed subsequently. Most pornographic works are theoretically work for hire meaning pornographic models do not receive statutory royalties for their performances. Of particular difficulty is the changing community attitudes of what is considered obscene, meaning that works could slip into and out of copyright protection based upon the prevailing standards of decency. This was not an issue with the copyright law up until 1972 when copyright protection required registration. The law was changed to make copyright protection automatic, and for the life of the author. Some courts have held that copyright protection effectively applies to works, whether they are obscene or not,Mitchell Bros. Film Group v. Cinema Adult Theater, 604 F.2d 852 (5th Cir.1979) and Jartech v. Clancy, 666 F.2d 403 (9th Cir.1982) held that obscenity could not be a defense to copyright claims. but not all courts have ruled the same way.Devils Films, Inc. v. Nectar Video Under, 29 F.Supp.2d 174, 175 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) refused to follow the Mitchell ruling and relied on the doctrine of \\"clean hands\\" to deny copyright protection to works seen as obscene. The copyright protection rights of pornography in the United States has again been challenged as late as February 2012.\\"You Can‚Äôt Copyright Porn, Harassed BitTorrent Defendant Insists\\", TorrentFreak, 6 February 2012.

STD prevention and birth control methods  According to the cast of the Netflix documentary ‚ÄúHot Girls Wanted‚Äù, most of the actors and actresses get screened for STD‚ÄôS every two weeks. However, it is not required for them to be on birth control. One actress in the film states that after partaking in a ‚ÄúCream Pie‚Äù shot which involves ejaculation in the vagina, she was then instructed to purchase Plan B (emergency contraception pill) in order to protect herself from pregnancy. These shots pay more, which is why women will take the risk of falling pregnant. Views on pornography A caricature on \\"the great epidemic of pornography\\", 19th-century French illustration Views and opinions of pornography come in a variety of forms and from a diversity of demographics and societal groups. Opposition of the subject generally, though not exclusively, comes from three main sources: law, feminism and religion. =Feminist views= Many feminists, including Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon, argue that all pornography is demeaning to women or that it contributes to violence against women, both in its production and in its consumption. The production of pornography, they argue, entails the physical, psychological, or economic coercion of the women who perform in it, and where they argue that the abuse and exploitation of women is rampant; in its consumption, they charge that pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation and coercion of women, and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in rape and sexual harassment.Shrage, Laurie (Fall 2015), \\"Feminist perspectives on sex markets: pornography\\", Pdf. * Reprinted as: * Also reprinted as: Preview. They charge that pornography presents a severely distorted image of sexual relations, and reinforces sex myths; that it always shows women as readily available and desiring to engage in sex at any time, with any man, on men's terms, always responding positively to any advances men make. They argue that because pornography often shows women enjoying and desiring to be violently attacked by men, saying \\"no\\" when they actually want sex, fighting back but then ending up enjoying the act ‚Äì this can affect the public understanding of legal issues such as consent to sexual relations. In contrast to these objections, other feminist scholars argue that the lesbian feminist movement in the 1980s was good for women in the porn industry. As more women entered the developmental side of the industry, this allowed women to gear porn more towards women because they knew what women wanted, both for actresses and the audience. This is believed to be a good thing because for such a long time, the porn industry has been directed by men for men. This also sparked the arrival of making lesbian porn for lesbians instead of men. Furthermore, many feminists argue that the advent of VCR, home video, and affordable consumer video cameras allowed for the possibility of feminist pornography. Consumer video made it possible for the distribution and consumption of video pornography to locate women as legitimate consumers of pornography. Tristan Taormino says that feminist porn is \\"all about creating a fair working environment and empowering everyone involved.\\" Feminist porn directors are interested in challenging representations of men and women, as well as providing sexually-empowering imagery that features many kinds of bodies. In a 1995 essay for The New Yorker, writer Susan Faludi argued that porn was one of the few industries where women enjoy a power advantage in the workplace. \\"'Actresses have the power,' Alec Metro, one of the men in line, ruefully noted of the X-rated industry. A former firefighter who claimed to have lost a bid for a job to affirmative action, Metro was already divining that porn might not be the ideal career choice for escaping the forces of what he called 'reverse discrimination.' Female performers can often dictate which male actors they will and will not work with. 'They make more money than us.' Porn ‚Äì at least, porn produced for a heterosexual audience ‚Äì is one of the few contemporary occupations where the pay gap operates in women's favor; the average actress makes fifty to a hundred per cent more money than her male counterpart. But then she is the object of desire; he is merely her appendage, the object of the object.\\" (Emphasis in original). Harry Brod offered a Marxist feminist view: \\"I would argue that sex seems overrated because men look to sex for fulfillment of nonsexual emotional needs, a quest doomed to failure. Part of the reason for this failure is the priority of quantity over quality of sex which comes with sexuality's commodification.\\" =Religious views= Religious organizations have been important in bringing about political action against pornography. In the United States, religious beliefs affect the formation of political beliefs that concern pornography. Pdf. =Women in the industry= The 2012 study \\"Why Become a Pornography Actress?\\" analyzed female pornographic film actresses and their reasons for choosing the occupation, finding that the primary reasons were money (53%), sex (27%), and attention (16%). Respondents also stated the aspects of their work which they disliked. These included industry-associated people, e.g., co-workers, directors, producers, and agents, whose \\"attitudes, behaviors, and poor hygiene [were] difficult to handle within their work environment\\" or who were unscrupulous and unprofessional (39%); STD risk (29%); and exploitation within the industry (20%).

Originally, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the information technology research that created the basic NVO infrastructure through a multi-organization collaborative effort. The NVO was more than a ‚Äúdigital library‚Äù; it was a vibrant, growing online research facility akin to a bricks-and-mortar observatory for professional astronomers. As of October 1, 2014, funding ceased for the National Virtual Observatory (NVO) and all code and digital assets of the project were made publicly available at the VAO Closeout Repository.VAO Closeout Repository Concept The NVO was conceived to allow scientists to grapple with the enormous growth in astronomical data resulting from significant advances in telescope, detector, and computer technologies. These advances have resulted in a plethora of images, other data, and catalogs. In August 2001, the NSF allocated funding for a proposal entitled \\"Framework for the National Virtual Observatory\\". The grant was approved under its Information Technology Research program (since superseded). NVO funding supported collaboration to produce a distributed computing framework for an integrated cyber infrastructure for astronomers providing seamless access to these astronomical resources. The manifestation of this infrastructure was an operational ‚Äúvirtual observatory‚Äù available to scientists and to the public. Investigators acquired existing astronomical data from a variety of observatory archives through ‚Äúvirtual instruments‚Äù, that is, computer interfaces, tools, and services. The NVO was planned and implemented in synergy with the research community, the primary users of the system. In 2007, the operational stage of the NVO began with combined funding from NSF and NASA and programmatically executed through NSF. Scientists originally accessed the NVO through the NVO website.US-VO.org Data Data in the NVO Closeout Repository are available from a variety of observatories and wavelengths, including NSF's National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO), National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and the 2 Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). Also found in the NVO are NASA's rich data collections including data from the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and other space-based missions. The NVO Closeout Repository provides access to a variety of additional data from nearly every astronomical research facility, observatory, and telescope across the globe. Collaboration The NVO development project was distributed across many institutions and includes teams at the Johns Hopkins University, California Institute of Technology, Space Telescope Science Institute, NOAO, Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, San Diego Supercomputer Center, and the Associated Universities, Inc. Affiliate organizations with participating teams include Goddard Space Flight Center, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Pittsburgh, National Center for Supercomputing Applications, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, University of Southern California, Fermilab, United States Naval Observatory, the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, and National Radio Astronomy Observatory. The NVO, a US effort, had affiliates throughout the international astronomical community including IVOA, AstroGrid (UK), Euro-VO, the Japanese VO, the Australian VO, VO India and ten other national programs. Public Access  Along with its objective to serve the scientific community by enabling research through distributed data sources and services, the NVO served the public through educational and outreach resources on the Virtual Observatory website.Virtualobservatory.org The modest NVO Education and Public Outreach (EPO) effort was coordinated from Space Telescope Science Institute. The NVO provided technical support for the development of educational modules integrated into partner programs. NVO EPO coordinated activities with the international communities as well.

In 1921 he broke into silent films as a Mack Sennett comic, debuting in On a Summer Day. He was the fifth of six children of theatrical actor, producer and manager John Clyde.John Clyde: Scotland's first film star, Helensburgh Heritage. Retrieved 2012-01-29.

Retrieved 2012-01-29. Although Andy Clyde's movie career spanned 45 years, he may be best known for his work as California Carlson in the Hopalong Cassidy movie series. He is also known for roles in two television series: the farmer Cully Wilson in CBS's Lassie and as the neighbor George MacMichael on ABC's The Real McCoys. Early years In 1912, age 20,\\"New York Passenger Arrival Lists (Ellis Island), 1892-1924\\", database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:JJY3-W2K : 16 August 2019), Andrew A. Clyde, 1912. Clyde first came to the United States on tour in the Graham Moffat Players, playing the part of Bob Dewar in a vaudeville comedy sketch depicting tenement life in Glasgow called The Concealed Bed. Years later, at the invitation of his close friend James Finlayson, he returned to the United States in 1920 to join producer Mack Sennett's roster of comedians.Andy Clyde: Film star, Helensburgh Heritage. Retrieved 2012-01-29. Clyde's mastery of makeup allowed him tremendous versatility; he could play everything from grubby young guttersnipes to old crackpot scientists. He hit upon an \\"old man\\" characterization in his short comedies, and the masquerade was immediately successful. Adopting a gray wig and mustache, he used this makeup for the rest of his short-subject career, and the character was so durable that he literally grew into it. He starred in short comedies longer than any other actor (32 years, 1924‚Äì56). He made a successful transition to sound films while in Mack Sennett's employ. In 1932, when the Sennett studio was facing financial problems, Sennett cut Clyde's salary. Clyde objected and Sennett put the \\"old man\\" costume on character actor Irving Bacon. Audiences reacted adversely, and Sennett abandoned the character. Educational Pictures, Sennett's distributor, took over the Andy Clyde series, which continued for two more years. Columbia Pictures launched its short subject department in 1934 and Andy Clyde was one of the first comedy stars signed by producer Jules White. Unlike many of the Columbia short-subject comedians who indulged in broad facial and physical gestures, Clyde was subtler and more economical: his comic timing was so good that he could merely lift an eyebrow, shudder slightly, or mutter \\"My, my, my\\" for humorous effect. His work for Columbia was prolific enough that, from the mid-1940s, the studio was able to produce lower-budgeted remakes, editing older scenes into the new ones. You Were Never Uglier (1944), for example, was remade with the same principals in 1953 as Hooked and Rooked. Clyde was such an audience favorite that he continued to star in Columbia shorts through 1956. He outlasted every comedian on the Columbia payroll except The Three Stooges.Okuda, Ted; Watz, Edward; (1986). The Columbia Comedy Shorts, p. 69, McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Clyde as George MacMichael, charmed by Joan Blondell as the McCoys' Aunt Win Clyde also kept busy as a character actor in feature films; for example, he played a sad provincial postman in the Katharine Hepburn film The Little Minister and Charles Coburn's drinking buddy in The Green Years. In the 1940s, he gravitated toward outdoor and western adventures. Clyde is well remembered for his roles as a comic sidekick, usually teaming with William Boyd in the Hopalong Cassidy series, as \\"California Carlson\\" (a role he also played in the Hopalong Cassidy radio program), or with Whip Wilson in Monogram Pictures' low-budget western movies. Clyde also worked on the Hopalong Cassidy \\"record readers\\" issued by Capitol Records in the 1950s. Television career Clyde's last theatrical film was released in 1956, after which he worked mostly in television, having appeared on Rod Cameron's syndicated series City Detective. On The Pepsi-Cola Playhouse and Studio 57 in 1954 and 1955, respectively, he portrayed Tom Harper in the episode \\"Santa's Old Suit,\\" with co-star Jane Darwell. Clyde guest-starred in several other early series too, including The People's Choice, Soldiers of Fortune, My Little Margie, The Bob Cummings Show, and Lock Up. He appeared in two children's programs: as Colonel Jack in four episodes of Circus Boy and as Homer Tubbs in four segments of ABC's western series The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin. In 1959, Clyde played Captain Gibbs in two segments of the ABC/Warner Brothers western series Colt .45. As \\"Scatterbrain Gibbs\\", he appeared with Tol Avery as Barnes in \\"Queen of Dixie\\"; in the story line, series character Christopher Colt (Wayde Preston) is aboard a Mississippi River gambling boat and encounters a ring of counterfeiters. Clyde subsequently played \\"Captain Gibbs\\" in the episode \\"Yellow Terror\\", with Brad Dexter in the role of John Barker. That same year, Clyde portrayed millionaire \\"Andrew C. Cooley\\" in the CBS fantasy drama The Millionaire. Clyde and Denver Pyle were cast in the 1960 episode \\"The Man Who Wanted Everything\\" of the ABC western drama The Man from Blackhawk, starring Robert Rockwell as a roving insurance investigator. From 1960 to 1962, Clyde was cast as the farmer Pa McBeam in five episodes of the NBC western series The Tall Man, starring Barry Sullivan and Clu Gulager. Judy Nugent plays McBean's daughter, June. In three episodes, Olive Sturgess played daughter May McBeam. In \\"The Reluctant Bridegroom\\" (February 18, 1961), Ellen Corby is featured as Hannah Blossom, a potential mail order bride, for Pa McBeam. Through a fraudulent letter written by the McBeam daughters, Hannah is lured to Lincoln, New Mexico, the setting of the series, to seek out the potential husband. In \\"Substitute Sheriff\\" (January 6, 1962), the McBeam daughters enlist their father as an acting sheriff in a scheme to thwart the seizure of their property for right-of-way by the railroad. Bob Hastings appears in this episode as J. S. Chase. In 1962-1963, Clyde portrayed Dr. Parkinson in three episodes of the NBC medical drama Dr. Kildare, starring Richard Chamberlain. Clyde was featured several times on Rory Calhoun's CBS western series The Texan, including the part of Wild Jack Hastings in \\"The Troubled Town\\" and in additional segments as the character Andy Miles. Clyde further guest-starred in such westerns as Wagon Train, Tales of the Texas Rangers, The Restless Gun, Jefferson Drum, Buckskin, Fury, Shotgun Slade, The Man from Blackhawk, and The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp (as Billy Buckett). On Lassie, Clyde played the eccentric farmer and nature lover, Cully Wilson, the friend to Timmy Martin, portrayed by child actor Jon Provost, in much the same fashion as Burt Mustin was cast as Gus the fireman for Jerry Mathers in Leave It to Beaver. In The Real McCoys, Clyde performed as the foil for another veteran character actor, Walter Brennan. Clyde played friendly, usually sincere neighbor George MacMichael to Brennan's devious \\"Grandpa Amos McCoy\\". Madge Blake played Flora, the sister of George McMichael with something of a romantic interest in Amos McCoy. Later, Clyde was cast as Skippy Draper in one episode of another Brennan ABC series, The Tycoon. In 1961, on CBS's The Andy Griffith Show, Clyde played Frank Myers, an eccentric old man whom the town tries to evict in the episode \\"Mayberry Goes Bankrupt\\". Clyde portrayed Poney Thompson in \\"Snakebite\\" in 1958 and Henry Squires in \\"Durham Bull\\" in 1962 on CBS's long-running western series Gunsmoke. Clyde appeared as Grandpa Jim Anderson in five episodes of the 1964‚Äì65 ABC military comedy No Time for Sergeants, starring Sammy Jackson. The series was inspired by an earlier Andy Griffith film of the same name. Personal life On September 23, 1932, Clyde married Elsie Maud Tarron, a former member of the Sennett Bathing Beauties, in Ontario in San Bernardino County, California. Jules White recalled that Clyde became a father in middle age, and was devastated when his nine-year-old son, John Allan Clyde, died.David Bruskin. Behind the Three Stooges: The White Brothers .

History Bodinayakanur is the second largest and most populated town in Theni district; the town is the taluk headquarters. Due to the weather and natural environment, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, called the town as \\"South Kashmir\\". A town located on the foothills of the Western Ghats, in the southern state of Tamil Nadu in India. This town is surrounded by (and has views of) the ranges of the Western Ghats on three sides. Theni, the nearest market town is 16 km from Bodi. During the nineteenth century, Bodinayakanur was an important place in the Nayakar rule. There is a small palace built by the Bodanayakar.

Conversion of all meter-gauge lines to broad-gauge - \\"Project Unigauge\\" of the Indian Railways - is the avowed goal to have seamless operations across the length and breadth of India without any disruptions or change of trains due to track gauge difference. Since the closing down of the track at the end of 2010, the gauge conversion has been plagued by very meager funds allocation by the Railway Administration. As a result, more than five years have passed with the track conversion woefully short of completion. The 2016 budget announced survey from Dindugal-Sabarimala Railway line.

Pandey's work at Asha Parivar is focused on Right to Information and other forms of citizen participation in removing corruption and improving the efficiency of governance.'The Wages of Protest' by Arundhati Dhuru and Sandeep Pandey He leads the National Alliance of People's Movements (NAPM), the largest network of grassroots people's movements in India.'Environment Justice' by John Byrne, Leigh Glover, Cecilia Martinez He was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award (often termed the 'Asian Nobel prize') in 2002 for the emergent leadership category.The 2002 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Emergent Leadership CITATION for Sandeep Pandey Pandey led an Indo-Pakistan peace march from New Delhi to Multan in 2005. He has served as an adviser to the Indian government's Central Advisory Board for Education (CABE). His idea of education is based on empowerment by imbibing the spirit of co-operation instead of competition. Sandeep Pandey's contract as a visiting faculty in the Chemical Engineering department at Indian Institute of Technology (BHU),Varanasi was prematurely terminated in January, 2016. Statement issued by Sandeep Pandey after being sacked from IIT-BHU Later in April 2016, the Allahabad High Court quashed the decision citing the violation of principal of natural justice. In April, 2019 he launched his book titled \\"Mujhe Kashi Hindu Vishwavidyalaya Se Kyun Nikala Gaya\\" at New Delhi, Lucknow and Varanasi. This book throws light on the work he did during his stint as professor at IIT (BHU), the reasons and events leading to his expulsion and the elaborate Allahabad High Court judgement clearing him of all the false accusations resulting in his expulsion. Controversies In 2002, he attended the opening session of a conference organised by the Communist Party of India, Marxist Leninist Liberation, (CPI- MLL). Several prominent social activists, environmentalists, and writers- turned-activists like Mahashweta Devi, Arundhati Roy, Sandeep Pandey, Rajinder Sachar, Praful Bidwai, and Anand Patwardhan attended only the opening session of the six-day congress. Sandeep Pandey and other social activists did not attend the closing session in which the kin of about 1000 Naxalites who were killed in police action in Bihar were reportedly honoured. Upon receiving the Ramon Magsaysay Award, he returned the cash portion of the award on being challenged to do so by a Philippine newspaper for his earlier remarks describing America as \\"the biggest terrorist state in the world.\\" Pandey later clarified that he had never meant to criticise the people of the United States but its government. In 2010, he visited Dantewada district in Chhattisgarh for a Jan Sunvayi (people's hearing) on atrocities by the local government. His visit was seemingly opposed by some members of local tribal community, where some local tribals were shown to be protesting against him and his team. It was said by Medha Patkar, that the protest was \\"stage managed\\" by the district administration officials themselves and the government was rousing the locals rural folk against the civil rights workers. Patkar also added that their team is not in favour of government responding to the violence perpetrated by Maoists by further violence by the state. She referred to Salwa Judum as an example of excesses by the state. Personal life Sandeep is the eldest of the three children of Sri IP Pandey who was an engineer in Railways and retired as member Railway Board. His younger brother Rahul who is an IIT Kanpur and IIM Ahmedabad alumnus lives in Bengaluru. His sister Priyanka lives in USA. Pandey lives in Indira Nagar, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. He is married to Arundhati Dhuru and has two children, Chaitanya Pandey and Anandi Pandey. He does not wear ironed clothes and does not take milk, as according to him, cows produce milk for their young ones. He has campaigned along with school students of Shiksha Niketan and its principal, Dr. Brahmanand Mishra, in his home district of Ballia, against soft drink manufacturers .

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) was an experimental molten salt reactor at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) researching this technology through the 1960s; constructed by 1964, it went critical in 1965 and was operated until 1969. The MSRE was a 7.4 MWth test reactor simulating the neutronic \\"kernel\\" of a type of inherently safer epithermal thorium breeder reactor called the liquid fluoride thorium reactor. It primarily used two fuels: first uranium-235 and later uranium-233. The latter 233UF4 was the result of breeding from thorium in other reactors. Since this was an engineering test, the large, expensive breeding blanket of thorium salt was omitted in favor of neutron measurements. In the MSRE, the heat from the reactor core was shed via a cooling system using air blown over radiators. It is thought similar reactors could power high-efficiency heat engines such as closed-cycle gas turbines. The MSRE's piping, core vat and structural components were made from Hastelloy-N and its moderator was a pyrolytic graphite core. The fuel for the MSRE was LiF-BeF2-ZrF4-UF4 (65-29-5-1), the graphite core moderated it, and its secondary coolant was FLiBe (2LiF-BeF2), it operated as hot as 650 ¬∞C and operated for the equivalent of about 1.5 years of full power operation. The result promised to be a simple, reliable reactor. The purpose of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment was to demonstrate that some key features of the proposed molten-salt power reactors could be embodied in a practical reactor that could be operated safely and reliably and be maintained without excessive difficulty. For simplicity, it was to be a fairly small, one-fluid (i.e. non-breeding) reactor operating at 10 MWth or less, with heat rejection to the air via a secondary (fuel-free) salt. Reactor description Molten salt reactor =Core= Graphite MSRE core The pyrolytic graphite core, grade CGB, also served as the moderator. Before the MSRE development began, tests had shown that salt would not permeate graphite in which the pores were on the order of a micrometer. Graphite with the desired pore structure was available only in small, experimentally prepared pieces, however, and when a manufacturer set out to produce a new grade (CGB) to meet the MSRE requirements, difficulties were encountered.. =Fuel/primary coolant= The fuel was 7LiF-BeF2-ZrF4-UF4 (65-29.1-5-0.9 mole %). The first fuel was 33% 235U, later a smaller amount of 233UF4 was used. By 1960 a better understanding of fluoride salt based molten-salt reactors had emerged due to earlier molten salt reactor research for the Aircraft Reactor Experiment. Fluoride salts are strongly ionic, and when melted, are stable at high temperatures, low pressures, and high radiation fluxes. Stability at low pressure permits less robust reactor vessels and increases reliability. The high reactivity of fluorine traps most fission reaction byproducts. It appeared that the fluid salt would permit on-site chemical separation of the fuel and wastes. The fuel system was located in sealed cells, laid out for maintenance with long-handled tools through openings in the top shielding. A tank of LiF-BeF2 salt was used to flush the fuel circulating system before and after maintenance. In a cell adjacent to the reactor was a simple facility for bubbling gas through the fuel or flush salt: H2-hydrogen fluoride to remove oxide, fluorine to remove uranium as uranium hexafluoride. Haubenreich and Engel, Robertson, and Lindauer provide more detailed descriptions of the reactor and processing plant. =Secondary coolant= Molten FLiBe The secondary salt was LiF-BeF2 (66‚Äì34 mole %). =Pump= The bowl of the fuel pump was the surge space for the circulating loop, and here about of fuel was sprayed into the gas space to allow xenon and krypton to escape from the salt. Removing the most significant neutron poison xenon-135 made the reactor safer and easier to restart. In solid-fuel reactors, on restart the 135Xe in the fuel absorbs neutrons, followed by a sudden jump in reactivity as the 135Xe is burned out. Conventional reactors may have to wait hours until xenon-135 decays after shutting down and not immediately restarting (so-called iodine pit). Also in the pump bowl was a port through which salt samples could be taken or capsules of concentrated fuel-enriching salt (UF4-LiF or PuF3) could be introduced. =Air-cooled heat exchangers= MSRE air-cooled heat exchanger glowing a dull red due to high temperature. At the time, the high temperatures were seen almost as a disadvantage, because they hampered use of conventional steam turbines. Now, such temperatures are seen as an opportunity to use high- efficiency closed-cycle gas turbines. After two months of high-power operation, the reactor was down for 3 months because of the failure of one of the main cooling blowers. =Neutronics and thermal-hydraulics= The reactor experienced stable neutronic operation. If either temperatures increased, or bubbles formed, the volume of the fluid fuel salts would increase and some fluid fuel salts would be forced out of the core, thereby reducing the reactivity. The MSRE development program did not include reactor physics experiments or heat transfer measurements. There was enough latitude in the MSRE that deviations from predictions would not compromise safety or accomplishment of the objectives of the experimental reactor. =Building grounds= Aircraft Reactor Experiment building at ORNL that was retrofitted to house the MSRE. Construction of the primary system components and alterations of the old Aircraft Reactor Experiment building (which had been partly remodeled for a proposed 60-MW(t) aircraft reactor) were started in 1962. Installation of the salt systems was completed in mid-1964. ORNL was responsible for quality assurance, planning, and management of construction. The primary systems were installed by ORNL personnel; subcontractors modified the building and installed ancillary systems. =Structural alloy Hastelloy-N= A low chromium, nickel‚Äìmolybdenum alloy, Hastelloy-N, was used in the MSRE and proved compatible with the fluoride salts FLiBe and FLiNaK.DeVan, Jackson H. \\"Effect of Alloying Additions on Corrosion Behavior of Nickel‚ÄìMolybdenum Alloys in Fused Fluoride Mixtures.\\" Thesis. University of Tennessee, 1960. Web. <>. All metal parts contacting salt were made of Hastelloy-N. The choice of Hastelloy-N for the MSRE was on the basis of the promising results of tests at aircraft nuclear propulsion conditions and the availability of much of the required metallurgical data. Development for the MSRE generated the further data required for ASME code approval. It also included preparation of standards for Hastelloy-N procurement and for component fabrication. Almost 200,000 lb (90,000 kg) in a variety of shapes of material for the MSRE was produced commercially. Requests for bids on component fabrication went to several companies in the nuclear fabrication industry, but all declined to submit lump-sum bids because of lack of experience with the new alloy. Consequently, all major components were fabricated in U.S. Atomic Energy Commission-owned shops at Oak Ridge and Paducah.. At the time that design stresses were set for the MSRE, the data that was available indicated that the strength and creep rate of Hastelloy-N were hardly affected by irradiation. After the construction was well along, the stress-rupture life and fracture strain were found to be drastically reduced by thermal neutron irradiation. The MSRE stresses were reanalyzed, and it was concluded that the reactor would have adequate life to reach its goals. At the same time a program was launched to improve the resistance of Hastelloy-N to the embrittlement. An out-of-pile corrosion test program was carried out for Hastelloy-N,. which indicated extremely low corrosion rates at MSRE conditions. Capsules exposed in the Materials Testing Reactor showed that salt fission power densities of more than 200 W/cm3 had no adverse effects on compatibility of fuel salt, Hastelloy-N, and graphite. Fluorine gas was found to be produced by radiolysis of frozen salts, but only at temperatures below about .. Components that were developed especially for the MSRE included flanges for lines carrying molten salt, freeze valves (an air-cooled section where salt could be frozen and thawed), flexible control rods to operate in thimbles at , and the fuel sampler-enricher.. Centrifugal pumps were developed similar to those used successfully in the aircraft reactor program, but with provisions for remote maintenance, and including a spray system for xenon removal. Remote maintenance considerations pervaded the MSRE design, and developments included devices for remotely cutting and brazing together pipe, removable heater-insulation units, and equipment for removing specimens of metal and graphite from the core. =Development and construction timeline= Most of the MSRE effort from 1960 through 1964 was devoted to design, development, and construction of the MSRE. Production and further testing of graphite and Hastelloy-N, both in-pile and out, were major development activities. Others included work on reactor chemistry, development of fabrication techniques for Hastelloy-N, development of reactor components, and remote-maintenance planning and preparations.. Operation Alvin M. Weinberg noting \\"6000 full-power hours!\\" of MSRE operation, in 1967. The MSRE operated for 5 years. The salt was loaded in 1964 and nuclear operation ended in December 1969, and all the objectives of the experiment were achieved during this period. Checkout and prenuclear tests included 1,000 hours of circulation of flush salt and fuel carrier salt. Nuclear testing of the MSRE began in June 1965, with the addition of enriched 235U as UF4-LiF eutectic to the carrier salt to make the reactor critical. After zero-power experiments to measure rod worth and reactivity coefficients, the reactor was shut down and final preparations made for power operation. Power ascension was delayed when vapors from oil that had leaked into the fuel pump were polymerized by the radioactive offgas and plugged gas filters and valves. Maximum power, which was limited to 7.4 MW(t) by the capability of the heat-rejection system, was reached in May 1966\\\\. After two months of high-power operation, the reactor was down for three months because of the failure of one of the main cooling blowers. Some further delays were encountered because of offgas line plugging, but by the end of 1966 most of the startup problems were behind. During the next 15 months, the reactor was critical 80% of the time, with runs of 1, 3, and 6 months that were uninterrupted by a fuel drain. By March 1968, the original objectives of the MSRE had been accomplished, and nuclear operation with 235U was concluded. AEC Chairman Seaborg at the MSRE controls in 1968 for startup with U-233. By this time, ample 233U had become available, (see PDF page 10) \\"The MSRE was fueled with 39 kilograms of 233U that contained ~220 parts per million (ppm) of 232U [...that was bred in] various Light Water Reactors that had operated on 235U (such as the Indian Point PWR)\\" so the MSRE program was extended to include substitution of 233U for the uranium in the fuel salt, and operation to observe the new nuclear characteristics. Using the on-site processing equipment the flush salt and fuel salt were fluorinated to recover the uranium in them as UF6. 233UF4-LiF eutectic was then added to the carrier salt, and in October 1968, the MSRE became the world's first reactor to operate on 233U. The 233U zero-power experiments and dynamics tests confirmed the predicted neutronic characteristics. An unexpected consequence of processing the salt was that its physical properties were altered slightly so that more than the usual amount of gas was entrained from the fuel pump into the circulating loop. The circulating gas and the power fluctuations that accompanied it were eliminated by operating the fuel pump at slightly lower speed. Operation at high power for several months permitted accurate measurement of the capture-to-fission ratio, for 233U in this reactor, completing the objectives of the 233U operation. In the concluding months of operation, xenon stripping, deposition of fission products, and tritium behavior were investigated. The feasibility of using plutonium in molten-salt reactors was emphasized by adding PuF3 as makeup fuel during this period. After the final shutdown in December 1969, the reactor was left in standby for nearly a year. A limited examination program was then carried out, including a moderator bar from the core, a control rod thimble, heat exchanger tubes, parts from the fuel pump bowl, and a freeze valve that had developed a leak during the final reactor shutdown. The radioactive systems were then closed to await ultimate disposal. =Statistics= Parameters and operational statistics: Power: 8 MW (thermal) output: 92.8 GWh equivalent full-power: 11,555 h Fuel salt: fluoride cations: 65% Li-7, 29.1% Be, 5% Zr, 0.9% U weight: 11,260 lbs (5,107 kg) melting temp: 813 F (434 C) inlet temp: 1175 F (635 C) outlet temp: 1225 F (663 C) flow rate: 400 gal/min (1514 L/min) fuel pump circulating: 19,405 h Coolant salt: fluoride cations: 66% Li-7, 34% Be weight: 15,300 lbs (6,940 kg) coolant pump circulating: 23,566 h Moderator: nuclear graphite Container: Hastelloy-N First fuel: U-235 first critical: 1 June 1965 thermal output: 72,441 MWh critical hours: 11,515 h full-power output equivalent: 9,006 h Second fuel: U-233 critical: 2 October 1968 thermal output: 20,363 MWh critical hours: 3,910 h full-power output equivalent: 2,549 h Shutdown: December 1969 Results The broadest and perhaps most important conclusion from the MSRE experience was that a molten salt fueled reactor concept was viable. It ran for considerable periods of time, yielding valuable information, and maintenance was accomplished safely and without excessive delay. The MSRE confirmed expectations and predictions. For example, it was demonstrated that: the fuel salt was immune to radiation damage, the graphite was not attacked by the fuel salt, and the corrosion of Hastelloy-N was negligible. Noble gases were stripped from the fuel salt by a spray system, reducing the 135Xe poisoning by a factor of about 6. The bulk of the fission product elements remained stable in the salt. Additions of uranium and plutonium to the salt during operation were quick and uneventful, and recovery of uranium by fluorination was efficient. The neutronics, including critical loading, reactivity coefficients, dynamics, and long-term reactivity changes, agreed with prior calculations. In other areas, the operation resulted in improved data or reduced uncertainties. The 233U capture-to-fission ratio in a typical MSR neutron spectrum is an example of basic data that was improved. The effect of fissioning on the redox potential of the fuel salt was resolved. The deposition of some elements (\\"noble metals\\") was expected, but the MSRE provided quantitative data on relative deposition on graphite, metal, and liquid-gas interfaces. Heat transfer coefficients measured in the MSRE agreed with conventional design calculations and did not change over the life of the reactor. Limiting oxygen in the salt proved effective, and the tendency of fission products to be dispersed from contaminated equipment during maintenance was low. Operation of the MSRE provided insights into the problem of tritium in a molten-salt reactor. It was observed that about 6‚Äì10% of the calculated 54 Ci/day (2.0 TBq) production diffused out of the fuel system into the containment cell atmosphere and another 6‚Äì10% reached the air through the heat removal system. The fact that these fractions were not higher, indicated that something partially negated the transfer of tritium through hot metals. One unexpected finding was shallow, inter-granular cracking in all metal surfaces exposed to the fuel salt. The cause of the embrittlement was tellurium ‚Äì a fission product generated in the fuel. This was first noted in the specimens that were removed from the core at intervals during the reactor operation. Post-operation examination of pieces of a control-rod thimble, heat-exchanger tubes and pump bowl parts revealed the ubiquity of the cracking and emphasized its importance to the MSR concept. The crack growth was rapid enough to become a problem over the planned thirty-year life of a follow-on thorium breeder reactor. This cracking could be reduced by adding small amounts of niobium to the Hastelloy-N. Decommissioning After shutdown, the salt was believed to be in long-term safe storage. At low temperatures, radiolysis can free fluorine from the salt. As a countermeasure, the salt was annually reheated to about until 1989.Disposition of the Fluoride Fuel and Flush Salts from the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, available as PDF But beginning in the mid-1980s, there was concern that radioactivity was migrating through the system. Sampling in 1994 revealed concentrations of uranium that created a potential for a nuclear criticality accident, as well as a potentially dangerous build-up of fluorine gas ‚Äì the environment above the solidified salt was approximately one atmosphere of fluorine. The ensuing decontamination and decommissioning project was called \\"the most technically challenging\\" activity assigned to Bechtel Jacobs under its environmental management contract with the U.S. Department of Energy's Oak Ridge Operations organization. In 2003, the MSRE cleanup project was estimated at about $130 million, with decommissioning expected to be completed in 2009.R. Cathey Daniels, Elegant experiment puts wallop on cleanup, The Oak Ridger, April 8, 2003. Removal of uranium from the salt was finally complete in March 2008, however still leaving the salt with the fission products in the tanks. Much of the high cost was caused by the unpleasant surprise of fluorine and uranium hexafluoride evolution from cold fuel salt in storage that ORNL did not defuel and store correctly, but this has now been taken into consideration in MSR design. A potential decommissioning process has been described;Evaluation of the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternatives for the Removal and Disposition of Molten Salt Reactor Experiment Fluoride Salts (1997), Commission on Geosciences, Environment and Resources uranium is to be removed from the fuel as the hexafluoride by adding excess fluorine, and plutonium as the plutonium dioxide by adding sodium carbonate.

Merrill in 1986. It is a non-profit creative writing program for students in grades seven and eight in the U.S. state of Ohio. Participation Power of the Pen is exclusive to the state of Ohio, having no competition at a national level. More than 200 school districts compete, each starting off with teams of twelve students, six from each grade. Qualification In most schools, students who want to join the Power of the Pen team participate in one or more tryout sessions, in which they are given a prompt that they must base an essay or short story within 40 minutes. After the allotted time, each story is given to the coach, who evaluates the writing and chooses students who they think are best for the team based on their writing skills. The teams compete in three different tournaments: a District, Regional, and State tournament. Based on where their schools are located, teams will participate in separate District and Regional tournaments throughout the state. As the team progresses, more and more members may be eliminated based on their scores in the previous tournament's submissions. Format =Tournaments= ;Districts : A District tournament is held at an elected participating school, the itinerary consisting of a welcoming orientation, three rounds of writing that are 40 minutes each, lunch, and an awards ceremony. There is only one judge per section of six writers.. As the name suggests, District tournaments consist of many local schools. There are about 80-120 students per grade that attend district tournaments. About 240 students attend each district. Placing in approximately the top 50% will qualify a student to for the Regional tournaments. Writers are graded by rank points, or the place they received within the specified set of writers. Quality points, the points given based on the essay's overall quality, are used to break ties in placing. ; Regionals : A Regional tournament follows the same itinerary, but there are two judges per section. On the first two rounds, each judge may grade individually. However, on the third round, both judges must agree to one score for each contestant in their group. An estimate of about 240 students attend Regional tournaments. Placing in approximately the top 20% will qualify a student for the State Finals. As with district tournaments, students receive rank points and quality points. ; State : State tournaments can last two days for schools willing to come a day earlier, or if a participating school has students who will help with the organization of the competition. States are usually held at a participating college, The College of Wooster being most popular. Students are permitted to sleep in assigned dorm rooms, and meals are provided for those who request and pay for them. There are three 35-minute rounds. This tournament is the only one with a fourth \\"Power Round\\" and allows 30 minutes to respond to the prompt. Students qualify for this round by being in the top 54 writers of their grade level. Like the District and Regional competitions, the prompts are graded by Quality Points and Rank Points. However, students' overall placement depends on quality points first, instead of rank points like the other two tournaments. :There is often a guest author/influential speaker that speaks during state tournaments. =Identification= During a tournament, each Power of the Pen member receives a four-digit number, which they are to use as identification instead of their names to prevent potentially biased judging. The first two digits are letters, remaining consistent throughout the school's team. The third digit is specific to the student's grade (7 for 7th grade, 8 for 8th grade), and the final digit is based on a random assignment of students from that school/grade. Prompts Each round consists of one prompt. Neither the writers nor the judges know what that round's prompt is going to be, and it is very rare for the writer to have ever even seen it before during practice sessions at school. As soon as the prompt is written down in a place for all in the room to see, the writer has 40 minutes (with the exception of States, which provides only 35 or 30 minutes) to write a response that has relevance to or includes the prompt. Some team coaches encourage writers to set aside about 5 minutes to think up a rough outline of the beginning, middle, and end. The details are filled in and improvised as the student writes. Finished copies are turned into the judge(s). Scoring Each student has at least one quality score and rank score per narrative. These items are both very different, and frequently confused with each other. =Score= The writer's score, also known as his or her Quality Points, is a numerical system used to establish the quality of the narrative. *94-100 points show a score of \\"Superior\\". *82-93 points show a score of \\"Honors\\". *75-81 points show a score of \\"Merit\\". =Rank= A scale of 1-6 is used in each room, as there are only 6 writers at most. A 1 represents the best and most creative of the six writers. Two writers may not receive the same score. Also, if one contestant has better rank points than the other, then he or she must also have better quality points. Much confusion is usually related to the difference of the two. If, for example, a person was awarded a \\"1\\" on their narrative; he or she still could have earned a low score of 80 or so. Earning a 1 means that the response to the prompt was better than the other five and the story held higher quality. Finalists ; Districts and Regional : At both District and Regional, the top 12 students in each grade level win awards according to their place. Approximately the top 50% of writers at District qualify for the Regional tournament. Individual Best of Round and Platinum Pen awards for Districts and Regional are awarded, as well. Stories that are awarded Platinum Pen honors appear in Power of the Pen's annual Book of Winners. The top three teams at each grade level also receive awards. Teams may win a Sweepstakes trophy at Regional. ; States : Students participate in three rounds of writing in the morning, and the top 54 students at each grade level qualify for a fourth round. The top 12 students in each grade level receive awards, and the top three teams overall are honored, as well. Special awards are given at the state tournament for the best writing of the preceding season, as well. Best of Round and Platinum Pen Awards ; Best of Round : Six students can win this award at each District and Regional tournament, as well as the State tournament; three in seventh grade and three in the eighth grade. There can only be one winner per grade level per round, and there cannot be a tie for Best of Rounds. The prize is a journal with a Power of the Pen logo on the front. ; Director's Choice : A committee of regional directors may choose several prompt responses as Director's Choice or Director's Best of Round writings. Winners of this award receive a journal with the Power of the Pen logo. = Platinum Pen Award = : The Platinum Pen Award is a level higher than Best of Round and Director's Choice. All of the Best of Round and Director's Choice stories from each tournament are evaluated, and the highest- quality writing receives a Platinum Pen Award. Platinum Pen stories are published in the Book of Winners. Platinum Pen Awards are given at the District, Regional, and State levels.

The Innovation Quarter, operated by Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, is home to academic groups, private companies and other organizations located on 330 acres in downtown Winston-Salem. Its tenants include departments from five academic institutions‚ÄîWake Forest School of Medicine, Wake Forest University, Forsyth Technical Community College, Winston-Salem State University, UNC School of the Arts‚Äî as well as private businesses and other organizations. One tenant is the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine (WFIRM), which is working to engineer more than 30 different replacement tissues and organs and to develop healing cell therapies. The science and research conducted at WFIRM is behind two start-up companies at Innovation Quarter. The ability of researchers and scientists to work alongside entrepreneurs furthers a goal of Innovation Quarter to develop new treatments and cures for disease and advances in technology. History and Growth thumbThe idea of a research park in Winston-Salem was a community-wide effort that began in the early 1990s in the wake of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company closing many of its former downtown warehouse and manufacturing buildings. Wake Forest School of Medicine's Department of Physiology and Pharmacology moved into one former Reynolds warehouse in 1993, along with eight researchers from Winston-Salem State University. Civic committees and discussion led to a master plan being announced in 2002 for what was then called Piedmont Triad Research Park. On August 27, 1998, a former Reynolds factory building burned in one of the city's worst fires ever. JDL Castle Corp. was renovating Building 256-2 and several other buildings for the research park. The first new building, One Technology Place, opened in 2000, occupied by Targacept Inc., a biopharmaceutical company that was spun out of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco. The company developed drugs to treat nervous system diseases and disorders. On April 7, 2000, developer David Shannon announced plans for a three-story building on the site of Building 256-2, and in a style recalling that building, which would house the medical school's Physician Assistant program. Biotech Place opened in February 2012. The 242,000-square-foot structure is composed of two former Reynolds warehouses that have been renovated into a modern biotech research facility, with custom-designed wet and labs as well as Class A office space. The $100 million project was Winston-Salem's most expensive ever downtown project; it houses Wake Forest School of Medicine's departments of Physiology and Pharmacology, Biomedical Engineering, and Immunology and Microbiology, as well as the Childress Institute for Pediatric Trauma. Private businesses‚ÄîCarolina Liquid Chemistries, Allegacy Federal Credit Union, Brioche Doree cafe‚Äîalso are tenants at Biotech Place. Piedmont Triad Research Park was renamed in March 2013 as Wake Forest Innovation Quarter in recognition of the shift from biotechnology to a mix of biomedical and material sciences, information technology, and other health and communications fields. Early 2014 saw Inmar Inc., an information technology company, move into another renovated former R.J. Reynolds building in the Innovation Quarter. Inmar relocated 900 employees from other sites in Winston- Salem to its new, state-of-the-art headquarters. The company also announced a partnership with the Division of Public Health Sciences of Wake Forest School of Medicine in which Inmar's digital analytics will be used to help locate and enroll patients for clinical trials conducted by the school. The Division of Public Health Sciences in early 2015 completed a move into the Innovation Quarter, in a building called 525@vine adjacent to Inmar's headquarters. The 525@vine building, a five-story R.J. Reynolds factory built in 1926 and renovated in 2012-13, also houses the School of Medicine's Physician Assistant program, as well as Forsyth Technical Community College‚Äôs Emerging Technologies Center, which trains more than 1,200 students annually. In 2020, the Innovation Quarter announced that it was simplifying its name in order to better reflect the diversity of companies, peoples and institutions located in the innovation district. Public-Private Collaboration With state and federal funding, and the cooperation of neighboring communities, Innovation Quarter's expansion plan includes private businesses, retail and residential units. Among the work is relocating Norfolk Southern Railroad lines, construction of a new rail bridge and burying Duke Energy transmission lines. More than $17 million from the City of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County, have helped leverage $350 million in state, federal and private investment at Innovation Quarter. Wake Forest Innovations The renaming of Piedmont Triad Research Park to Wake Forest Innovation Quarter came shortly after Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center created a new operating division, Wake Forest Innovations, to establish and manage new business, partnerships, licenses and start-up companies based on the discoveries, intellectual property and research assets of the medical center and Wake Forest University. Wake Forest Innovations has separate units that market its scientific business assets-core laboratories, preclinical translational services, for example-to outside partners, while also promoting discovery and innovation and the licensing of technologies.

It is used in wallpaper, carpeting, ropes, and vehicle interiors. Olefin's advantages are its strength, colourfastness and comfort, its resistance to staining, mildew, abrasion, and sunlight, and its good bulk and cover. History Italy began production of olefin fibers in 1957. The chemist Giulio Natta successfully formulated olefin suitable for more textile applications. Both Natta and Karl Ziegler were later awarded the Nobel Prize for their work on transition metal catalysis of olefins to fiber, also known as Ziegler‚ÄìNatta catalysis. Production of olefin fibers in the U.S. began in 1960. Olefin fibers account for 16% of all manufactured fibers. Major fiber properties Olefin fibers have great bulk and cover while having low specific gravity. This means ‚ÄúWarmth without the weight.‚Äù The fibers have low moisture absorption, but they can wick moisture and dry quickly. Olefin is abrasion, stain, sunlight, fire, and chemical resistant. It does not dye well, but has the advantage of being colorfast. Since Olefin has a low melting point, textiles can be thermally bonded. The fibers have the lowest static of all manufactured fibers and a medium luster. One of the most important properties of olefin is its strength. It keeps its strength in wet or dry conditions and is very resilient. The fiber can be produced for strength of different properties. Production method The Federal Trade Commission's official definition of olefin fiber is ‚ÄúA manufactured fiber in which the fiber forming substance is any long-chain synthetic polymer composed of at least 85% by weight of ethylene, propylene, or other olefin units‚Äù Polymerization of propylene and ethylene gases, controlled with special catalysts, creates olefin fibers. Dye is added directly to the polymer before melt spinning is applied. Additives, polymer variations and different process conditions can create a range of characteristics. High pressure production, which uses ten tons per square inch, creates a film for molded materials. Low pressure production uses a low temperature with a catalyst and hydrocarbon solvent. This process is less expensive and produces a polyethylene polymer more for textile use. The polymer is then melted, spun, by a spinneret into water, or air cooled. The fiber is drawn out to six times the spun length. Gel spinning is a new method in which a gel form of polyethylene polymers is used. Physical and chemical structure =Physical= Olefin fibers can be multi- or monofilament and staple, tow, or film yarns. The fibers are colorless and round in cross section. This cross section can be modified for different end uses. The physical characteristics are a waxy feel and colorless. =Chemical= There are two types of polymers that can be used in olefin fibers. The first, polyethylene, is a simple linear structure with repeating units. These fibers are used mainly for ropes, twines and utility fabrics. The second type, polypropylene, is a three-dimensional structure with a backbone of carbon atoms. Methyl groups protrude from this backbone. Stereoselective polymerization orders these methyl groups to the same spatial placement. This creates a crystalline polypropylene polymer. The fibers made with these polymers can be used in apparel, furnishing and industrial products. Manufacturers  The first commercial producer of an olefin fiber in the United States was Hercules, Inc. (FiberVisions). Other U.S. olefin fiber producers include Asota; American Fibers and Yarns Co; American Synthetic Fiber, LLC; Color-Fi; FiberVisions; Foss Manufacturing Co., LLC; Drake Extrusion; Filament Fiber Technology, Inc.; TenCate Geosynthetics; Universal Fiber Systems LLC.

The fiber can also be used in upholstery, draperies, wall coverings, slipcovers, and floor coverings. It is often used in basements due to its quick-drying and mold-resistant properties. =Automotive= Olefin can be used for interior fabrics, sun visors, arm rests, door and side panels, trunks, parcel shelves, and resin replacement as binder fibers. =Industrial= In an industrial setting, olefin creates carpets; ropes, geo- textiles that are in contact with the soil, filter fabrics, bagging, concrete reinforcement, and heat-sealable paper (e.g. tea- and coffee-bags). Care procedures Avoid dry cleaning Olefin as many dry-cleaning solvents can swell the fibers. Since Olefin dries quickly, line drying and low tumble drying with little or no heat is the recommended method of drying. Since Olefin is not absorbent, waterborne stains do not present a problem. However, oily stains are difficult to remove. Most such stains can be removed with lukewarm water and detergent, but bleach can also be used. Olefin fiber has a low melting point (around 225 to 335 ¬∞F, depending on the polymer's grade) so items should be ironed at a very low temperature, if at all. Items such as outdoor carpets and other fabrics can be hosed off. Olefin is easy to recycle.

Post-war period The General Confederation of Labour had its roots in the National Workers' Union (UON) and was founded on 13 September 1919. It was the only Portuguese trade union at the time. It was greatly influenced by the anarcho-syndicalist movement. According to its statutes, its three goals were: *the unification of all workers of the country to defend their \\"economic, social and professional interests, as well as to improve their moral, material and physical condition\\" *to develop the skills within the working class necessary to overthrow capitalism *to exercise the concept of mutual help The highest decision-making organ in the CGT was the confederation council, a national congress of representatives, which in turn elected seven members that formed the national committee to handle day-to-day matters. Some anarcho-syndicalists and the Communist Party called for the creation of a body to administer the economy after power had been seized. The organizational structure hardly differed from that of the UON. The main ideological difference was the distance it maintained to the Portuguese Socialist Party. The CGT's daily newspaper was called A Batalha. In 1922 the union became officially recognized and joined the International Workers Association (IWA). Estimates on the membership of the CGT differ greatly. The union itself claimed a membership of about 150,000 from 1919 to 1922 and a steady decrease to 50,000 by 1927. Other estimates claim the membership never even exceeded 100,000 and even shrank to 80,000 by 1922. The membership is considerable nonetheless as Portugal boasted only a few hundred thousand industrial workers and artisans at the time. From 1922 onwards membership fell considerably, despite militancy in the working class remaining constant. The phenomenon is likely the result of political bickering within the organization. Accordingly, the Communist Party withdrew all unions associated with it from the CGT in 1924 and established its own trade union federation in 1925. The CGT became increasingly concentrated in the industrial centers Lisbon/Set√∫bal/Barreiro, Porto/Braga, and Covilh√£. At the same time, actions by the union lost in efficiency, its structure became increasingly hierarchical, and repression by the state and business became more commonplace. Likewise, the circulation of A Batalha sank from 25,000 in 1919/1920 to 10,000 in 1925. In 1922, it was decided that non-union organizations could join the CGT as well. Ditadura Nacional and Estado Novo After the 28th May 1926 coup d'√©tat, the labour movement suffered great repression and the General Confederation of Labour would be dismantled. In 1927, it attempted a general strike against the government, which failed and led to 100 dead, the deportation of about 600 individuals involved in the conflicts to overseas territories, and the banning of the CGT, A Batalha, numerous individual trade unions, and the May Day demonstrations. At first, the confederation council and the national committee continued their work in secret, publishing a regular Information Bulletin, but on 2 November 1927, an assault by the government, which included arrests and attacks on suspected union offices by the police, further restricted union activity. The CGT continued to exist nonetheless. In 1929, it was even able to regain legality in a judicial battle, which it retained until 23 September 1933, when two government decrees banned all non-state-controlled trade unions. A general strike by the CGT and other organizations called for on 18 January 1934 failed. The illegal activities by the CGT were then limited to Lisbon and the Algarve. In 1938, Em√≠dio Santana, the secretary-general of the federation, took part in a failed assassination attempt on Salazar. The ensuing repression killed off the CGT completely.

The exact dates of the crisis are unclear because \\"Rome teetered between normality and crisis\\" for many decades.Flower, p. 103, n. 58, citing Gruen 12018 and Meier 1789, pp. 7‚Äì23. Likewise, the causes and attributes of the crisis changed throughout the decades, including the forms of slavery, brigandage, wars internal and external, land reform, the invention of excruciating new punishments,The root of excruciating means from crucifixion. See Fields, p. 79. the expansion of Roman citizenship, and even the changing composition of the Roman army.Fields, pp. 8, 18‚Äì25, 35‚Äì37. Modern scholars also disagree about the nature of the crisis. Traditionally, the expansion of citizenship (with all its rights, privileges, and duties) was looked upon negatively by Sallust, Gibbon, and others of their schools, because it caused internal dissension, disputes with Rome's Italian allies, slave revolts, and riots.Fields, p. 41, citing Sallust, Iugurthinum 86.2. However, other scholars have argued that as the Republic was meant to be res publica‚Äîthe essential thing of the people‚Äîthe poor and disenfranchised cannot be blamed for trying to redress their legitimate and legal grievances. Dating the crisis The Roman Republic at 100 BC. For centuries, historians have argued about the start, specific crises involved, and end date for the crisis of the Roman Republic. As a culture (or \\"web of institutions\\"), Florence Dupont and Christopher Woodall wrote, \\"no distinction is made between different periods.\\"Dupont, p. ix. However, referencing Livy's opinion in his History of Rome, they assert that Romans lost liberty through their own conquests' \\"morally undermining consequences.\\"Dupont, p. x. =Arguments for an early start-date (c. 134 to 73 BC)= Harriet I. Flower and Jurgen Von Ungern- Sternberg argue for an exact start date of 10 December 134 BC, with the inauguration of Tiberius Gracchus as tribune,Flower 2004, p. 89. or alternately, when he first issued his proposal for land reform in 133 BC.Flower 2004, pp. 90-92. Appian of Alexandria wrote that this political crisis was \\"the preface to ... the Roman civil wars\\".Flower, p. 89, citing Appian. Velleius commented that it was Gracchus' unprecedented standing for re-election as tribune in 133 BC, and the riots and controversy it engendered, which started the crisis: In any case, the assassination of Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BC marked \\"a turning point in Roman history and the beginning of the crisis of the Roman Republic.\\"Flower, p, 92. Barbette S. Spaeth specifically refers to \\"the Gracchan crisis at the beginning of the Late Roman Republic ...\\". Nic Fields, in his popular history of Spartacus, argues for a start date of 135 BC with the beginning of the First Servile War in Sicily.Fields, p. 7, 8-10. Fields asserts: The start of the Social War (91‚Äì88 BC), when Rome's nearby Italian allies rebelled against her rule, may be thought of as the beginning of the end of the Republic.Flower, p. 97.Fields, pp. 12, 24. Fields also suggests that things got much worse with the Samnite engagement at the Battle of the Colline Gate in 82 BC, the climax of the war between Sulla and the supporters of Gaius Marius.Fields, pp. 19-20. Barry Strauss argues that the crisis really started with \\"The Spartacus War\\" in 73 BC, adding that, because the dangers were unappreciated, \\"Rome faced the crisis with mediocrities\\".Strauss, p. 96. =Arguments for a later start date (69 to 44 BC)= Thornton Wilder, in his novel, The Ides of March, focuses on the period c. 69 BC to 44 BC as the Crisis. Pollio and Ronald Syme date the Crisis only from the time of Julius Caesar in 60 BC.Syme, p. 16, wrote that Pollio \\"made his history of the Civil Wars begin not with the crossing of the Rubicon, but with the compact between Pompey, Crassus, and Caesar....\\" Found at Google Books. Accessed 7 February 2011. Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon river, the northern boundary of Roman Italy, with his army in 49 BC, a flagrant violation of Roman law, has become the clich√©d point of no return for the Republic, as noted in many books, including Tom Holland's Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic.Tom Holland, Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic (Anchor Books 2003). . =Arguments for an end date (49 to 27 BC)= The end of the Crisis can likewise either be dated from the assassination of Julius Caesar on 15 March 44 BC, after he and Sulla had done so much \\"to dismantle the government of the Republic,\\"Flower, pp. 85, 366. or alternately when Octavian was granted the title of Augustus by the Senate in 27 BC, marking the beginning of the Roman Empire.Flower, p. 366. The end could also be dated earlier, to the time of the constitutional reforms of Julius Caesar in 49 BC. Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus A fanciful 16th century portrayal of Tiberius Gracchus from Guillaume Rouill√©'s Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum Tiberius Gracchus took office as a tribune of the plebs in late 134 BC while \\"everything in the Roman Republic seemed to be in fine working order.\\"Flower, p. 89 There were a few apparently minor problems, such as \\"the annoyance of a slave revolt in Sicily\\"Flower, p. 89, see also Fields, pp. 7-10. (the First Servile War). At the same time, Roman society was a highly stratified class system whose divisions were bubbling below the surface. This system consisted of noble families of the senatorial rank, the knight or equestrian class, citizens (grouped into two or three classes depending on the time period - self-governing allies of Rome, landowners, and plebs or tenant freemen), non- citizens who lived outside of southwestern Italy, and at the bottom, slaves. By law, only men who were citizens could vote in certain assemblies, and only those men who owned a certain amount of real property could serve in the military, which would gain them social prestige and additional benefits of citizenship.Fields, p. 41; Flower, pp. 90‚Äì91, 93; Dupont, pp. 40‚Äì41, 45‚Äì48. The government owned large tracts of farmland (ager publicus) that it had gained through conquest or escheat (acquisition from owners who had died without heirs); this it rented out to large landholders who used their slaves to till it or who sub-leased it to small tenant farmers.Flower, pp. 90-91 There was some social mobility and limited suffrage.Flower, p. 89, nn. 2, 3, citing various scholars discussions (citations omitted). The plebs (or plebeians) were a socio-economic class, but also had possible origins as an ethnic group with its own cult to the goddess Ceres, and ultimately, were a political party during much of the Roman Republic.For a further discussion of the plebs and Ceres, see Spaeth (1996), pp. 6‚Äì10, 14‚Äì15, and 81‚Äì102 (Chapter 4 of that treatise), citing R. Mitchell, Patricians and Plebeians: The Origin of the Roman State (Ithaca and London 1990). This social system had been stable after the Conflict of the Orders, since economically both the patricians and the plebeians were relatively both well off. Italy was dominated by small landowners. However, sometime after the Punic Wars, this changed due to various factors. Partly due to the availability of cheap grain coming into the Roman food supply, as well as the social displacement caused to farmers who had to serve on long foreign campaigns using their own financial resources and often having to sell out, the countryside came to be dominated by large estates (latifundia) owned by the Senatorial order. This led to a population explosion in Rome itself, with the plebeians clinging desperately to survival while the patricians lived in splendor. This income inequality severely threatened the constitutional arrangements of the Republic, since all soldiers had to be property owners, and gradually property owning was being limited to a small Senate, rather than being evenly distributed across the Roman population. Beginning in 133 BC, Gracchus tried to redress the grievances of displaced smallholders. He bypassed the Roman senate and used the plebeian assembly to pass a law limiting the amount of land belonging to the state that any individual could farm.Flower, p. 90. This would have resulted in the breakup of the large plantations maintained by the rich on public land and worked by slaves. Gracchus' moderate plan of agrarian reform was motivated \\"to increase the number of Roman citizens who owned land and consequently the number who would qualify as soldiers according to their census rating.\\" The plan included a method to quiet title, and had a goal of increasing the efficiency of farmland, while doling out small parcels of land to tenant farmers, his populist constituency. Gracchus used a law that had been in place for over a century, the lex Hortensia of 287 BC, which allowed the assembly of plebs to bypass the Senate. However, another tribune, Marcus Octavius, used his veto to scuttle the plan. It was widely believed that the rich Senators had bribed Octavius to veto the proposal. The crisis escalated: Gracchus pushed the assembly to impeach and remove Octavius; the Senate denied funds to the commission needed for land reform; Gracchus then tried to use money out of a trust fund left by Attalus III of Pergamum; and the Senate blocked that, too.Flower, pp. 90-91. At one point, Gracchus had \\"one of his freedmen... drag Octavius from the speaker's platform.\\"Spaeth (1996), p. 75. This assault violated the Lex sacrata, which prohibited people of lower status from violating the person of a person of higher class. Rome's unwritten constitution hampered reform. So Gracchus sought re-election to his one-year term, which was unprecedented in an era of strict term limits.Flower, pp. 89, 91. The oligarchic nobles responded by murdering Gracchus.Strauss, p. 204-205Spaeth (1996), pp. 74-75. Because Gracchus had been highly popular with the poor, and he had been murdered while working on their behalf, mass riots broke out in the city in reaction to the assassination.Flower, pp. 91-92. Barbette Stanley Spaeth asserts that Ceres' roles as (a) patron and protector of plebeian laws, rights and Tribunes and (b) \\"normative/liminal\\" crimes, continued throughout the Republican era.Spaeth (1996), p. 73. These roles were \\"exploited for the purposes of political propaganda during the Gracchan crisis....\\" Ceres' Aventine Temple served the plebeians as cult centre, legal archive, treasury, and court of law, founded contemporaneously with the passage of the Lex sacrata; the lives and property of those who violated this law were forfeit to Ceres, whose judgment was expressed by her aediles.For discussion of the duties, legal status and immunities of plebeian tribunes and aediles, see Andrew Lintott, Violence in Republican Rome, Oxford University Press, 1999, pp. 92‚Äì101, and Spaeth, pp. 85-90. The official decrees of the Senate (senatus consulta) were placed in her Temple, under her guardianship; Livy bluntly states this was done so that the consuls could no longer arbitrarily tamper with the laws of Rome.Livy's proposal that the senatus consulta were placed at the Aventine Temple more or less at its foundation (Livy, Ab urbe condita, 3.55.13) is implausible. See Spaeth (1996) p.86‚Äì87, 90. The Temple might also have offered asylum for those threatened with arbitrary arrest by patrician magistrates.The evidence for the temple as asylum is inconclusive; discussion is in Spaeth, 1996, p.84. Ceres was thus the patron goddess of Rome's written laws; the poet Vergil later calls her legifera Ceres (Law-bearing Ceres), a translation of Demeter's Greek epithet, thesmophoros.Cornell, T., The beginnings of Rome: Italy and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Punic Wars (c. 1000‚Äì264 BC), Routledge, 1995, p. 264, citing vergil, Aeneid, 4.58. Those who approved the murder of Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BC justified his death as punishment for his offense against the Lex sacrata of the goddess Ceres: those who deplored this as murder appealed to Gracchus' sacrosanct status as tribune under Ceres' protection. In 70 BC, Cicero refers to this killing in connection with Ceres' laws and cults.David Stockton, Cicero: a political biography, Oxford University Press, 1971, pp. 43‚Äì49. Cicero's published account of the case is usually known as In Verrem, or Against Verres.Cicero, Against Verres, Second pleading, 4.49‚Äì51:English version available at wikisource. Spaeth believed that he was killed because: Rather than attempting to atone for the murder, the Senate used a mission to Ceres' temple at Henna (in Sicily) to justify his execution.Spaeth (1996), p. 74, fn. 84, pp. 204-205, citing Cicero, Dom. 91, et al.. The agrarian reforms were only partially implemented by the commission; yet Gracchi colonies were set up in both Italy and Carthage.Dupont, pp. 45-46, 48. About nine years later Tiberius's younger brother, Gaius, passed more radical reforms. In addition to settling the poor in colonies on land conquered by Rome, he passed the lex frumentaria, which gave the poor the right to buy grain at subsidized prices.Flower, p. 93 In the past, the senate eliminated political rivals either by establishing special judicial commissions or by passing a senatus consultum ultimum (\\"ultimate decree of the senate\\").Polybius, 133Polybius, 136 Both devices allowed the senate to bypass the ordinary due process rights that all citizens had.Abbott, 98 Some of Gaius' followers caused the death of a man, many historians contend they were attacked and were acting in self- defense. In any case, the death was used by Gaius Gracchus's political rival, Lucius Opimius, to suspend the constitution again with another senatus consultum ultimum.Flower, p. 94, citing J. von Ungern-Sternberg, Unter suchungen: senatus consultum ultimum, pp. 55-57 (Munich 1970) and W. Nippels, Public order in ancient Rome, pp. 57-69 (Cambridge 1995). Gaius fled, but he was also probably murdered by the oligarchs. According to one ancient source, Gaius was not killed directly by them, but ordered his slave Philocrates to do the deed in a murder-suicide.Dupont, p. 58, n. 29, citing Valerius maximus, Works, VI.8.5. Gaius Marius and Sulla A Roman denarius depicting Sulla The next major reformer of the time was Gaius Marius, who like the Gracchi, was a populist. Unlike them, he was also a general.Flower, pp. 95-96. He abolished the property requirement for becoming a soldier during the Jugurthine War, when the Roman army was very low on manpower and had difficulty maintaining the conflict. The poor enlisted in large numbers. This opening of the Army's ranks to the capite censii enfranchised the plebs, thus creating an esprit de corps in the enlarged army.See also Fields, pp. 12, 46. Some elites complained that the army now became unruly due to the commoners in its ranks, but this is without good cause: Marius employed his soldiers to defeat an invasion by the Germanic Cimbri and Teutons. His political influence and military leadership allowed him to obtain six terms as consul in 107, and 103 to 99 BC, an unprecedented honour. However, on 10 December 100 BC the senate declared another senatus consultum ultimum, this time in order to bring down Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, a radical tribune in the mould of the Gracchi who had been inciting violence in Rome on behalf of Marius' interests. The Senate ordered Marius to put down Saturninus and his supporters, who had taken defensive positions on the Capitol. Marius proceeded to do this, but imprisoned Saturninus inside the Curia Hostilia, intending it seems to keep him alive. However, a senatorial mob lynched the tribune regardless, by climbing atop the Senate House and throwing dislodged roof tiles down onto Saturninus and his supporters below. Sulla, who was appointed as Marius' quaestor in 107, later contested with Marius for supreme power. In 88, the senate awarded Sulla the lucrative and powerful post of commander in the war against Mithridates over Marius. However, Marius managed to secure the position anyway, through political deal-making with Publius Sulpicius Rufus. Sulla initially went along, but finding support among his troops, seized power in Rome and marched to Asia Minor with his soldiers anyway. There, he fought a largely successful military campaign and was not persecuted by the senate. Marius himself launched a coup with Cinna in Sulla's absence and put to death some of his enemies. He instituted a populist regime, but died soon after. Sulla made peace with Rome's enemies in the east and began to arrange for his return to Rome. Cinna, Marius's populist successor, was killed by his own men as they moved to meet Sulla on foreign soil. When Sulla heard of this, he ceased negotiations with Rome and openly rebelled in 84. Invading the peninsula, he was joined by many aristocrats including Crassus and Pompey and defeated all major opposition within a year. He began a dictatorship and purged the state of many populists through proscription. A reign of terror followed in which some innocents were denounced just so their property could be seized for the benefit of Sulla's followers. Sulla's coup resulted in a major victory for the oligarchs. He reversed the reforms of the Gracchi and other populists, stripped the tribunes of the people of much of their power and returned authority over the courts to the senators. Pompey Bust of Pompey the Great in the Residenz, Munich Pompey the Great, the next major leader who aggravated the crisis, was born Gnaeus Pompeius, but took his own cognomen of Magnus (\\"the Great\\").Losch, p. 390. Pompey as a young man was allied to Sulla, but in the consular elections of 78 BC, he supported Lepidus against Sulla's wishes. When Sulla died later that year, Lepidus revolted, and Pompey suppressed him on behalf of the senate. Then he asked for proconsular imperium in Hispania, to deal with the populares general Quintus Sertorius, who had held out for the past three years against Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius, one of Sulla's most able generals.Fields, q.v., get p. # Pompey's career seems to have been driven by desire for military glory and disregard for traditional political constraints.Holland, Tom, Rubicon: The Triumph and Tragedy of the Roman Republic, pp. 141‚Äì42 (Abacus, London, 2004). . Pompey served next to Crassus and Julius Caesar as part of the first triumvirate of Rome, however, before this, the Roman aristocracy turned him down‚Äî as they were beginning to fear the young, popular and successful general. Pompey refused to disband his legions until his request was granted.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, Life of Pompey, p. 158 (Loeb Classical Library, 1917). The senate acceded, reluctantly granted him the title of proconsul and powers equal to those of Metellus, and sent him to Hispania.Boak, Arthur E.R. A History of Rome to 565 A.D., p. 152 (MacMillan, New York, 1922). Pompey infamously wiped out what remained of Spartacus' troops in 71 BC, who had been pinned down by Marcus Crassus.Losch, p. 349; Fields, pp. 71-81. He received Rome's highest honor, the triumph, while Crassus the lesser honor of an ovation, which hurt Crassus' pride.Fields, pp. 81-82; Losch, p. 349; Strauss, pp. 195-200. In 69 BC, he conquered Syria, defeated King Tigranes of Armenia, and replaced one puppet king, Seleucus VII Philometor with his brother Antiochus XIII Asiaticus. Four years later, he deposed the monarchy, replacing it with a governor. This not only finished off the Seleucids,Losch, pp. 379-390, 575. but brought in thousands of slaves and strange peoples, including the Judeans, to Rome, thus creating the Jewish diaspora.Losch, p. 349. This generated swarms of refugees, which can only have created its own discord. While many of Pompey's reckless actions ultimately increased discord in Rome, his unlucky alliance with Crassus and Caesar is cited as being especially dangerous to the Republic. In January 49 B.C., Caesar led his legions across the Rubicon River from Cisalpine Gaul to Italy, thus declaring war against Pompey and his forces. In August 48 B.C., with Pompey in pursuit, Caesar paused near Pharsalus, setting up camp at a strategic location. When Pompey's senatorial forces fell upon Caesar's smaller army, they were entirely routed, and Pompey fled to Egypt. Pompey hoped that King Ptolemy, his former client, would assist him, but the Egyptian king feared offending the victorious Caesar. On 28 September, Pompey was invited to leave his ships and come ashore at Pelusium. As he prepared to step onto Egyptian soil, he was treacherously struck down and killed by an officer of Ptolemy.

Typically quibbles are used in legal bargains and, in fantasy, magically enforced ones.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Quibbles\\" p 796  Examples  William Shakespeare used a quibble in The Merchant of Venice. Portia saves Antonio in a court of law by pointing out that the agreement called for a pound of flesh, but no blood, and therefore Shylock can collect only if he sheds no blood, which is not physically possible. He also uses one in Macbeth where Macbeth is killed by Macduff, despite it being said that ‚Äúnone of woman born‚Äù shall vanquish him, as the latter character was born by Caesarean section. A pact with the Devil commonly contains clauses that allow the devil to quibble over what he grants, and equally commonly, the maker of the pact finds a quibble to escape the bargain. In Norse mythology, Loki, having bet his head with Brokk and lost, forbids Brokk to take any part of his neck, saying he had not bet it; to avenge himself Brokk instead sews Loki's lips shut. When the hero of the Child ballad The Lord of Lorn and the False Steward is forced to trade places with an impostor and swear never to reveal the truth to anyone, he tells his story to a horse while he knows that the heroine is eavesdropping. In the similar fairy tale The Goose Girl, the princess pours out her story to an iron stove, but not knowing that the king is listening.Maria Tatar, The Annotated Brothers Grimm, p 320 W. W. Norton & company, London, New York, 2003  Prophecies and spells  When Croesus consulted the Pythia, he was told that going to war with Cyrus the Great would destroy a great empire. Croesus assumed that the seer meant that the Persian Empire would be destroyed and Croesus would triumph. He proceeded to attack the Persians, believing victory was assured. In the end, however, the Persians were victorious, and the empire destroyed was not Cyrus's but Croesus's. In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Macbeth believes that he is invincible because the Three Witches give him the prophecy that \\"none of woman born shall harm [him].\\" In the final battle of the play, Macduff is able to kill Macbeth, because Macduff reveals that he was \\"from his mother's womb untimely ripp'd\\" ‚Äî born via a Caesarean section. In a second prophecy, Macbeth is told that he has nothing to fear until Great Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane Hill. He feels safe since he knows that forests cannot move, but is overcome when the English army, shielded with boughs cut from Birnam Wood, advances on his stronghold at Dunsinane. In The Lord of the Rings, the Elf Glorfindel's prophecy states that \\"not by the hand of man will the Witch-king of Angmar fall.\\" The Witch-king is slain by √âowyn, a woman, during the battle of the Pelennor Fields. She is aided by Merry, a male hobbit who distracted him by stabbing him with a N√∫menorean blade, as the Ringwraiths are harmed by such swords.

In 1990 its membership was thirteen million, including most of the adult population of the country. The political purpose of this national organization, sponsored by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (SKJ), was to involve as many people as possible in activities on the party agenda, without the restrictions and negative connotations of direct party control. The SSRNJ also was chartered as a national arbitration forum for competing, cross-regional interests. Although party officials were forbidden to hold simultaneous office in SSRNJ, the top echelon of the latter was dominated by established party members. The importance of SSRNJ to the party leadership increased as the party's direct control over social and state institutions decreased. It was useful in mobilizing otherwise apathetic citizens during the Croatian crisis of 1971 and the Kosovo crisis of 1987.Text used in this cited section originally came from: Former Yugoslavia Country Study from the Library of Congress Country Studies project. The Constitution stipulated a wide variety of social and political functions for SSRNJ, including nomination of candidates for delegate at the commune level, suggesting solutions to national and local social issues to assembly delegates, and overseeing elections and public policy implementation. Both individuals and interest groups held membership. The structure of SSRNJ was very similar to that of the party, including a hierarchy that extended from national to commune level. SSRNJ organizations in the republics and provinces were simplified versions of the national structure. The national organization was run by a conference of delegates chosen by the regional SSRNJ leadership. The conference presidium included members from the party, the armed forces, trade unions, Socialist Youth League, and other national organizations. Like the SKJ Central Committee, the SSRNJ conference established departments to formulate policy recommendations in areas such as economics, education, and sociopolitical relations. Coordinating committees were also active in interregional consultation on policy and mass political action. Delegates of Maribor branch of SZDL in informal talk before the conference, January 1962 In SR Slovenia, the Socialist Alliance became an umbrella organization for a number of nonparty organizations with political interests, beginning in 1988. On a lesser scale, similar changes occurred in other republics. This development rekindled the idea that SSRNJ might be divorced from SKJ domination and reconstituted as a second political party at the national level. Pending such an event, SSRNJ was regarded throughout the 1980s as a puppet of the party elite, particularly by virtue of its exclusive control over the nomination of assembly delegates at the commune level. One of the Presidents of the Federal Conference was Veljko Milatoviƒá.

Although its boundaries are not precise, West Philadelphia is to its north, Kingsessing is to the south, Cedar Park is to the east, and Cobbs Creek is to the west. The Angora Commuter Rail Station on the Media/Elwyn Line, two bus lines (routes 46 and \\"G\\"), and a trolley line (SEPTA Route 34) all intersect around Baltimore Avenue and 58th Street, which is unofficially the nexus of the neighborhood. Angora was certified as blighted by the City Planning Commission on May 12, 2005, yet Angora Terrace and other portions of the neighborhood are well-kept. History The neighborhood was founded by Robert and George Callaghan in 1863, who named it for Ankara, the city in Turkey. The landscape was sparsely populated until for decades, and a surrounding woodland provided a bucolic environment seemingly separate from the city of which it was part. Development began in earnest between 1900 and 1920. In its founding, it was the site of the Callaghan textile mill; later, in the early 20th century, a mill that produced yarn and a factory that produced glass were erected. This industry was accompanied by the relatively limited development of residential areas within the neighborhood, mainly restricted to the 5800 block of Baltimore Avenue (between 1918 and 1920) and to an area that once was a grove of trees, known as Sherwood Forest. A nearby attraction for residents (mainly children and older residents) was Kingsessing Park, in the Kingsessing neighborhood, in which a recreation center was constructed in 1918. Of note was the Sherwood Cricket Club of Angora. A watercolor of it can be found at the PhillyH2O website. Cricket was an important sport at that time, with the Belmont Cricket Club, in West Philadelphia, being one of the most prominent venues in the country. There are many references to the Sherwood Cricket Club of Angora on cricketarchive.com.

Built in 1925, the theater is one of the more prominent public buildings constructed in Hilo in the early 20th century. Architects Davis & Fishbourne designed the theater in the Beaux-Arts style. The two-story building has five bays on its front facade; a metal marquee divides the two stories. The three central bays feature broken pediments and decorative urns above the second-floor windows. A parapet with a balustrade runs along the top of the building. . After the original theater closed, the Palace reopened in 1998 as an arthouse. The theater was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 11, 1993. The Palace Theater features a restored lobby with a cafe serving refreshments during movie showings, concerts and theatrical performances. The theater itself features steeply banked amphitheater seating in three tiers, and a wonderful decorative proscenium frames the stage. A large Wurlitzer pipe organ is also present. The palace is a favorite venue for performers and bands, with concerts regularly scheduled. Every spring a local variety show fund-raiser features local talent, and each fall a full theatrical musical production is staged for serial performances over the course of a month. Independent films are a consistent draw. Special events are staged as well, allowing the public to see and use the theater for many events outside of the typical use as a movie theater.

Among them are the two \\"Professor Brainard\\" movies, The Absent-Minded Professor (1961) and Son of Flubber (1963); and the \\"Dexter Riley\\" trilogy: The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes (1969), Now You See Him, Now You Don't (1972), and The Strongest Man in the World (1975); as well as the remake of The Absent-Minded Professor, Flubber (1997) and the 1995 remake of The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes. The town of Medfield, the location of Medfield College, is the setting for another Disney film, The Shaggy D.A. (1976), implying that Medfield is also the setting of that film's predecessor, The Shaggy Dog (1959). A total of eight films were set either in the town of Medfield or at Medfield College. Inspiration Medfield College is named after the town of Medfield, Massachusetts. According to town historians, friends of Walt Disney lived there, and Disney would visit them on occasion, landing his plane on a private airstrip on their property. Portions of the airstrip are still present today. The cornerstone of Blake Middle School, formerly Medfield High School, has a quote from Disney inscribed on it: \\"Our greatest natural resource is in the minds of our children.\\" Fight song The fight song of Medfield College, composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman, is heard during the opening credits sequence of The Absent-Minded Professor. Filming locations The Medfield College scenes in both The Absent-Minded Professor and Son of Flubber were filmed on the campus of Pomona College in Claremont, California. Some of the football field scenes in Son of Flubber were filmed at Burbank High School, as evidenced by a banner bearing the school's name that is seen in the background. The Medfield College scenes in the three Dexter Riley films were filmed on the Disney Studios backlot in Burbank, California. Some Medfield College scenes in the 1997 Flubber remake were shot at San Jose State University. Similar institutions The 2002 revamp of the Journey into Imagination attraction at Walt Disney World Resort's Epcot includes several visual elements suggesting that the attraction's \\"Imagination Institute\\" is linked to Medfield College. The queue line for the attraction passes the \\"offices\\" of Professor Brainard (Fred MacMurray's role in The Absent-Minded Professor) and Dean Higgins (Joe Flynn's role in the Dexter Riley films). The ride includes a view of a glass-fronted computer room, with a sign on the door indicating \\"no tennis shoes allowed,\\" a reference to The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, the first Dexter Riley film. A Medfield College letterman's jacket can be seen inside the room. The Disney Kingdoms comic book title Figment 2 features a reference to Professor Brainard visiting the comics's \\"Academy Scientifica-Lucida\\" from Medfield. Similar to Medfield is Midvale College, a fictional university used as the setting for the two Merlin Jones films by Disney, The Misadventures of Merlin Jones (1964) and its sequel, The Monkey's Uncle (1965). Merrivale College is a fictional university in the 1973 Disney film The World's Greatest Athlete. The fictional Godolphin College of Godolphin, North Carolina fills a like role in the 1968 film Blackbeard's Ghost; the setting is the same as in the original novel by Ben Stahl.

The film starred Ekin Cheng, Cecilia Cheung, Louis Koo, Patrick Tam, Kelly Lin, Wu Jing, with special appearances by Sammo Hung and Zhang Ziyi. It is based on the same source as the 1983 film Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain. Plot Peacekeeping immortals living in clans inhabit a mythical mountain range called Zu, which is situated between Heaven and Earth. A demon called Insomnia desires to rule Zu and the world below, so it begins to destroy the various clans. In the Kunlun Mountains, Dawn sends away her apprentice, King Sky, because she believes that their emotional attachment to each other hinders their progress. She gives him her weapon, the Moon Orb, to help him train. He is to return only after he has attained a higher level. If she cannot be found, the Moon Orb will find her. Moments after they part, Insomnia attacks Dawn and disintegrates her. 200 years later, at Omei, Grandmaster White Brows senses darkness coming and despatches his student, Red, to investigate. King Sky joins Red and the Omei clan to fight Insomnia. White Brows engages and weakens Insomnia with his weapon, the Sky Reflector. Insomnia retreats into the legendary Blood Cave after its defeat with Omei's top warriors in pursuit. At the cave, King Sky notices Enigma, an Omei member who resembles Dawn. White Brows warns them that the cave is capable of draining the powers of those who venture near it. Red and King Sky risk their lives to battle Insomnia in the cave, and narrowly escape after White Brows sacrifices the Sky Reflector to save them. With Insomnia absorbing the cave's energy, White Brows orders Red to guard the cave entrance while the Omei members regroup and return to base. White Brows tries to combine Enigma's Heaven Sword with Hollow's Thunder Sword, the two guardian weapons of Omei, to form a new weapon, the Flaming Sword of Thunder. Unfortunately, the fusion process fails and rebounds, causing Hollow to die and Enigma to be seriously injured. King Sky rescues Enigma. White Brows tells King Sky that Enigma is Dawn's reincarnation. He then appoints King Sky as the chief of Omei while he enters a new dimension to find a weapon to destroy Insomnia. Before leaving, he resurrects Hollow, who is renamed Ying, in the hope that the reborn Hollow can wield the Thunder Sword in their most desperate hour. However, when Ying turns out to be rather inept, King Sky tries to take his place and use the Thunder Sword himself, but fails and ends up being burnt to death. Enigma mourns his loss and buries his charred remains. In the meantime, Red is possessed by Amnesia, a flower demon, while standing guard outside the Blood Cave. He returns to Omei, decimates the clan, and captures Enigma. Amnesia then destroys the rest of Omei. To the Omei survivors' frustration, Ying has yet to reawaken his past avatar and unlock his abilities. However, during a match against Thunder, an Omei swordsman, Ying suddenly recalls his past life and regains his powers. Concurrently, King Sky returns to life just in time to intercept and receive the new weapon found by White Brows. With the new weapon, King Sky joins Ying and the Omei survivors in confronting the possessed Red at the Blood Cave. After Ying rescues Enigma, they return to Omei to stop Insomnia's final assault. King Sky exorcises Red, but the latter sacrifices himself to destroy Amnesia. At Omei, Enigma and Ying successfully fuse their swords to form a new weapon to defeat Insomnia. King Sky joins the duo and they weaken Insomnia. Enigma possesses Insomnia to prevent the demon from escaping, giving King Sky a chance to destroy it. Just as Insomnia is destroyed, Enigma remembers herself as Dawn and tells King Sky she is happy to find him again before disappearing. After the battle, Enigma is reincarnated as a new immortal and Mount Omei is restored. King Sky parts with the Omei to rebuild his clan.

It was eventually released on DVD on 19 August 2005 under the title Zu Warriors. Box office The film grossed HK$10 million in its theatrical release in Hong Kong. Critical reception The Legend of Zu received mixed reviews from critics. Those who praised the film mostly noted its thrilling action scenes and elaborate, computer-generated sets. The American release of the film was cut down extensively from 104 minutes to 80 minutes, with many plot and character development scenes being removed and most of the action scenes intact. This resulted in viewers finding the American version much harder to follow because of shallow characters and a plot so stripped of substance. References External links  Michael Chung.

The original California Bungalow style buildings at the front of the property, built to house the station's technical staff and their families, were later used as accommodation for student firefighters. The original generator building housed the Teaching Centre, while the concrete blocks used to anchor the aerials' guy wires are still visible in multiple locations around the property.

It was abolished in 2005. The NHSU was originally proposed by the Labour Party in the lead up to the 2001 general election, which was followed by a consultation exercise between November 2002 and May 2003. The organisation was launched in December 2003 as a special health authority. At its launch, its main aims were to improve the training of NHS staff by: # creating and improving opportunities for learning, # creating high quality learning environments, # leading research into future learning needs. The organisation claimed to have made much progress on achieving these aims with the creation of a large number of different training programmes and the setting up of a training helpline for staff called the u-i. However, with the publication of the \\"Reconfiguring the Department of Health's arm's length bodies\\" report in July 2004, it was decided to reduce the number and size of the Special Health Authorities in order to bring about efficiency savings. On 30 September 2004, the then Secretary of State for Health, John Reid, announced that the NHSU would be merged with the NHS Modernisation Agency to form the new NHS Institute for Learning, Skills and Innovation, now NHS Institute For Innovation and Improvement. This merging would allow the cutting of staff from 1,500 to 300 people. The NHSU was officially dissolved on 31 July 2005, with its 23 remaining learning programmes being transferred to the Skills for Health organisation by 29 September 2005. In 2007, following a two- year campaign under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the report written by Sir William Wells, into the NHSu was released.

The school was founded in 1842 as an all-girls finishing school in Western New York and was moved to Toledo in 1884, where it became The Smead School for Girls. The school became coeducational and adopted its present location and name in the early 1930s. Today, MVCDS has approximately 500 students from preschool through 12th grade. It is accredited by ISACS and NAIS. The school gets its name of \\"Maumee Valley\\" from the nearby Maumee River, which flows north through Lucas County and Toledo, finally emptying into Lake Erie. Site history Maumee Valley Country Day School was founded in New York as Miss Bryan's Seminary, a highly regarded finishing and boarding school for girls. The school relocated to the Toledo area in 1884 and became The Smead School for Girls, run by Miss Smead In 1934, the school relocated to its current location on South Reynolds Road in Toledo, Ohio with the construction of the Smead Building, and became a co-ed school. In 1959, a new building to house the upper school was built near the Smead Building on the campus. In 1972, the current lower and middle school building was completed next to the upper school building; they are connected by a hallway known as the \\"International Hall\\". A large dining hall and kitchen were added in the area between the two buildings. In 1984, a new science center was added to the upper school classrooms. In 1988, a 400m running track was built next to the sports fields by Glendale Avenue. In 1991, the Wolfe Gallery was constructed next to the Smead Building to showcase student and professional art projects that were displayed at the school. In 1997, a new area known as the \\"Johnson Bayer Physical Education Complex\\" was added. This included new sports offices, a weight training room, and a new gymnasium that were added next to the existing upper school gym. The middle school was expanded with additional classrooms as well as a science lab, and the 300 seat \\"Millennium Theatre\\" and lobby were built next to the dining hall. A large clock tower was built next to the new theatre lobby, establishing a central location on the campus. In addition, the road on campus was extended to Glendale Avenue to provide a second entrance/exit and a parking lot was added next to the new gymnasium. In 2007, new outdoor adventure course challenges were built throughout the woods on the campus. They include both low and high ropes course challenges for students. In 2009, a renovation project began to rebuild the upper school building and connect all of the campus buildings under one roof. Maumee Valley is also home to the Dayal House, a boarding school for international students. This $1.6 million project was designed in order to create a family-like atmosphere for the students living there. The school has had a variety of headmistresses and headmasters over the years. Gary Boehm was the head of school from 2006 to 2018. Lynn Casto assumed the role in July, 2018. Renovation By the mid 2000s, it was becoming clear that the existing upper school building, which was approaching 50 years of age, was too small and poorly heated/cooled to meet the needs of students. In 2007, a massive capital campaign was launched to rebuild the upper school buildings. During the summer of 2009, the upper school commons area was demolished and construction on the foundation for the new building began. The old upper school classrooms were demolished in March, 2011. Another part of the plan included connecting the buildings to make traversing the campus easier. The plan included a connector that joined all of these buildings through the addition of an enclosed hallway between the Lower School and Smead buildings, giving students access to every building without traveling outside. The balcony area around the lunch room was enclosed in glass as well. The Smead building, which is also the oldest structure on campus, was renovated to house the entire early childhood (Preschool- Kindergarten) program. Finally, a small roof was added next to the drop-off area to protect students from bad weather while they wait for buses or carpools. The entire operation, known as the \\"Under One Roof\\" project, totaled over 15 million dollars. The new building was designed by the parents of one of the students. It is considerably larger than the old upper school building, with an average of 25% more floorspace per classroom. It was placed on the footprint of the old upper school commons room and contains two floors. The new building incorporates natural lighting to reduce energy consumption. The class of 2015 will be the first group of students to occupy this new building during all four years of high school (the class of 2014 will occupy the building for about 3 years). There were no plans to renovate the lower and middle school building in the project. Athletics The school is a member of the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) and competes in the ten- school Toledo Area Athletic Conference (TAAC) conference. The school has co-ed teams in eight sports at the varsity and junior varsity levels including: field hockey, tennis, soccer, golf, baseball, lacrosse, and basketball. The school used to have a football team, but this was canceled in the late 1970s.

Cooley held the same position at Fairfield University from 2006 to 2011. He received the inaugural 2010 Ben Jobe National Coach of the Year Award, presented annually to the top minority men's college basketball coach in the nation. Early years Cooley was born on September 10, 1969 in Providence, Rhode Island to Jane Cooley and Edward Smith. He was one of nine children by his mother in a family on welfare, living in the low-income South Providence neighborhood. However, he would later be taken in by neighbors Gloria and Eddie Searight, who provided Cooley with meals and a place to sleep. At Providence's Central High School, Cooley played basketball and twice earned Rhode Island Player of the Year honors. After graduating in 1988, Cooley attended the New Hampton School in New Hampton, New Hampshire for a post- graduate year in 1988‚Äì1989. Matriculating to Stonehill College in Easton, Massachusetts, Cooley was required to take the SATs four times before the NCAA allowed him to play basketball there. He did not score high enough on his first two attempts, scored a 900 but was accused of cheating on his third test, and finally scored a 1390 on his fourth, supervised test. Cooley was a three-year team captain at Stonehill, and was named to the Northeast-10 Conference academic honor roll. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in history from Stonehill in 1994. Coaching career Following college, Cooley taught history at Bridgewater-Raynham Regional High School in Massachusetts from 1994 to 1996. Meanwhile, Cooley began his coaching career at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, spending the 1994‚Äì1995 season as an assistant men's basketball coach before returning to Stonehill as an assistant coach in 1995‚Äì1996. In 1996, Cooley joined Al Skinner's staff as an assistant coach for URI, before following Skinner to Boston College in 1997. In nine seasons as an assistant at BC, Cooley helped the Eagles post a 175‚Äì108 overall record, which included five 20-win seasons. The team captured the 2000‚Äì01 Big East Conference championship, five NCAA tournament berths, and one National Invitation Tournament, giving the team six post-season berths in nine seasons. =Fairfield (2006‚Äì2011)= Cooley earned his first head coaching position in 2006 for Fairfield University of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. In five seasons, Cooley's teams posted a 92‚Äì69 overall record and 58‚Äì32 conference record. In 2009‚Äì10, with a 23‚Äì11 record, Fairfield advanced to postseason play, setting an NCAA Division I postseason record by overcoming a 27-point halftime deficit to win in overtime over George Mason in the 2010 CollegeInsider.com Tournament. The Stags were defeated in the quarterfinals of the tournament by Creighton. In 2010‚Äì11, Cooley's Fairfield squad captured the MAAC regular season championship before falling in the semifinals of the 2011 MAAC Men's Basketball Tournament. They were defeated by Kent State in the second round of the 2011 NIT, finishing with a school-record 25‚Äì8 record. Cooley was named MAAC Men's Basketball Coach of the Year and was the USBWA District 1 Coach of the Year. =Providence (2011‚Äìpresent)= On March 22, 2011, Cooley returned to his hometown and the Big East, replacing Keno Davis as head coach at Providence College, becoming the 15th head coach in program history. Cooley began to reinvigorate the program by recruiting six consensus Top 100 recruits in his first three years. 2011‚Äì12 season In his first season at Providence, Cooley led the Friars to a 15-17 mark overall, posting an 11-3 mark (8-0 at home) in non-conference action and going 4-14 in the Big East. That season, point guard Vincent Council was named third-team All-Big East and forward LaDontae Henton earned Big East All-Rookie Team accolades. 2012‚Äì13 season In his second season, Cooley led the Friars to a 19-15 record overall and a 9-9 mark in league play. Included in the 9-9 Big East record in 2012-13 was a 7-2 mark over the last nine games of the conference season, marking the second best turnaround over second half of the season in Big East history. The Friars played the season with a short roster with transfers Carson Desrosiers and Tyler Harris having to sit out the year per NCAA transfer rules, five star Freshman shooting guard and Providence native Ricky Ledo sitting our per NCAA eligibility issues, and five star freshman point guard Kris Dunn sitting out the first semester with a shoulder injury. Friars freshman guard Josh Fortune was the only incoming player in the 2012-2013 season eligible to compete. Cooley guided the Friars to the NIT where the squad posted a 2-1 record, beating Charlotte and Robert Morris before losing in the quarterfinals to eventual NIT Champion Baylor. That season, combo guard Bryce Cotton was named first-team All-Big East and Kadeem Batts was recognized as a co-winner of the league's Most Improved Award and earned All-Big East Honorable Mention accolades. After spending one year at Providence without being able to play, Ricky Ledo declared for the 2013 NBA draft and was selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves, eventually being traded to the Dallas Mavericks. 2013‚Äì14 season In his third season at Providence and first season in the reconfigured Big East Conference, Cooley led the Friars to a 10-8 mark in the Big East Conference and finished tied for 3rd with Xavier and St. John's. Transfers Carson Desrosiers and sophomore forward Tyler Harris, were eligible to play their first season in black and white, having sat out the NCAA enforced one-year period. However, in addition to former point guard Vincent Council's graduation and Ricky Ledo entering the draft, Sophomore point guard Kris Dunn faced another shoulder injury and had to sit out almost the entire year as a medical redshirt, Cleveland State transfer sophomore guard Junior Lamomba had to sit out the NCAA enforced one- year period, and incoming Freshmen Brandon Austin and Rodney Bullock were suspended for the entire season due to an unspecified violation of team rules. The Friars finished the season at 23-12 mark overall, the most wins in a season since 1996-1997. Two players received regular season honors, Senior point guard Bryce Cotton was named first-team All-Big East and Senior forward Kadeem Batts earned second-team All-Big East accolades. Entering the Big East Tournament, the Friars played as the fourth seed due to losing the tie-breaker with Xavier. They defeated St. John's in the quarterfinals, Seton Hall in the semifinals, and Creighton in the thrilling final at Madison Square Garden, claiming PC's second tournament title in Big East history. By winning the Big East Tournament the team earned an automatic bid, removing any \\"bubble\\" fears. On their way to making history as the first tournament champion of the reconfigured league, Junior forward Ladonte Henton was named to the All- Tournament Team and Senior guard Bryce Cotton was named the tournaments Most Outstanding Player. On selection Sunday, the Friars were given the 11th seed in the 2014 NCAA Tournament East Regional and faced North Carolina. The Friars lost 79-77, but in defeat, Bryce Cotton scored a career high 36 points, making him the fourth all-time leading scorer in Providence College basketball history. Despite the loss, the season marked yet another major step forward by Cooley's in rebuilding the PC basketball program. 2014‚Äì15 season In his fourth season at Providence, Cooley led the Friars to a 22-12 record and went 11-7 in the Big East while finishing in sole possession of fourth place in the conference. Cooley received a boost by a dynamic recruiting class which included 3 composite Top 100 recruits (Paschal Chukwu, Jalen Lindsey, and Ben Bentil), as well as the return of Kris Dunn from his redshirt year due to his shoulder injury the season prior. Despite losing sharpshooter Josh Fortune as a result of transfer to the University of Colorado, Cooley gained the eligibility of transfer guard Junior Lomomba, who was forced to sit out the season before due to NCAA regulations. After beginning the season 5-0 (including an exciting 75-74 victory over Notre Dame in the championship game of the Hall of Fame Tip Off Tournament at Mohegan Sun), Providence was ranked #25 in the coaches poll, their first ranking since the 2003-2004 season. They later debuted in the AP poll on February 23, and peaked as high as 23rd in the polls. The Friars run in the polls was aided greatly by co-Big East Player of the Year Kris Dunn, who averaged 15.6 ppg and 7.5 apg in his return season, while senior forward LaDontae Henton added 19.7 ppg. Both players were named to the 2014-2015 First Team All-Big East team. Once again, the Friars faced St. John's in the first round of the Big East tournament, winning comfortably, before setting up a matchup against #4 Villanova in the second round of the tournament. Despite being heavy underdogs, Providence fought valiantly, only to be called for a controversial foul with 3.1 seconds left which led to two Ryan Arcidiacono free throws to seal a Villanova 63-61 victory. Villanova would later go on to win the Big East Tournament. As a result of its excellent season, Providence would be selected as a 6 seed in the 2015 NCAA Tournament East Region and faced the 11 seeded University of Dayton. Controversy again ensued for Ed Cooley's Friars, as the site of the game would be played in Columbus, Ohio, just 80 miles from Dayton's campus. Despite having qualified for the game two days before and being undersized, Dayton controlled the pace of play, and PC struggled after star guard Kris Dunn picked up 2 fouls in the first 2:42 of the game. After Providence cut the lead to 44-41 with 6:43 left, Dayton would go on a 14-4 run over the next 5:08 and go on to win comfortably 66-53 to end the Friars season. After the season, with star forward LaDontae Henton already graduating from the program, the other starting forward for the Friars, Tyler Harris, decided to explore a graduate season at the University of Auburn, and the Friars also lost highly regarded freshman Paschal Chukwu to Syracuse as a late transfer, a decision that surprised and confused Coach Cooley. After flirting with the NBA draft, Kris Dunn decided to return to Providence despite being considered a potential lottery pick in many NBA Draft projections. 2015‚Äì16 season In his fifth season, Cooley led the Friars to a 24‚Äì11, 10‚Äì8 in Big East play to finish in a tie for fourth place. They defeated Butler in the quarterfinals of the Big East Tournament to advance to the semifinals where they lost to Villanova. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament as a No. 9 seed where they faced USC in an exciting First Round matchup and won on a Rodney Bullock layup with 1.5 seconds left to advance to the Second Round where they lost to North Carolina.

It was a subsidiary of Clear Channel Communications. Together with its sister companies Metro Networks, Metro Source, Total Traffic Network, SigAlert and Traffax, the company operated a number of local and regional news and traffic operations that provided regular reports to affiliates. The company was founded in 1975 by Michael Lenet in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 96-1153 The name was derived from Lenet‚Äôs handle, or nickname; he called himself the \\"Silver Shadow.\\" Lenet began the operation as an informal traffic reporting service that was provided over citizens' band radio. Soon after, Lenet began providing traffic information to various radio stations in Philadelphia. Among the original air staff in New York were Donna Fiducia, Fred Feldman, George W. Forman, Susan Murphy, Joe Nolan and Bernie Wagenblast. Murphy also served as program director, and Fred Feldman was the general manager. Joe Biermann was the operations manager.David Hinckley, Shadow Traffic Turns 25 With No Delay En Route Daily News New York, NY The company grew and expanded into other markets, beginning in 1978 with Chicago, Illinois. New York City followed in December, 1979. This expansion continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s. During that time the company began offering news, weather, and sports services to its affiliates. The primary business philosophy was to provide broadcast services at little or no cost to their affiliates. The majority of the revenue was brought in through sponsorship deals; direct sponsoring of the traffic reports themselves did this. Chicago on-air personalities included John \\"Radio\\" Russell Ghrist. In March 1996 Shadow Broadcast Services was partially acquired by Westwood One, and then it was fully owned by Westwood One in May 1998. By that time Shadow Broadcast Services had affiliate relations with more than 350 radio and TV stations in 15 major markets. In March 1999 Shadow Broadcast Services formed what was referred to as a ‚Äústrategic alliance‚Äù with SmartRoute Systems, which was a technology based company that provided traffic information and data for local DOT (Department of Transportation) and broadcast use. This partnership was set up to help Shadow Traffic supply comprehensive and accurate traffic information for their radio and television affiliates. This partnership eventually dissolved when the acquisition of Metro Networks took place by Westwood One, which was announced in June, 1999, and then completed in September of that same year. Westwood One merged their two companies together to form Metro Networks/Shadow Broadcast Service, commonly abbreviated as Metro/Shadow. SmartRoute Systems was not directly partnered with Shadow Traffic after the acquisition of Metro Networks took place. However, in June 2000 Westwood One announced its acquisition of SmartRoute Systems. That company was eventually combined under the Westwood One umbrella of subsidiaries, which include Metro/Shadow. Most of the branch offices of Metro/Shadow have working relationships with the local Department of Transportation (DOT), local and state police, and government agencies to gather and distribute traffic information through their affiliates. Other traffic information is gathered by listening to police/fire/rescue scanners , phone calls, viewing traffic cameras, and visual reports made by reporters in fixed-wing and/or rotary-wing aircraft. In September 2008 Westwood One announced that they were reducing their Metro/Shadow operations centers from 60 offices to 13 regional hubs. Metro/Shadow claimed to have more than 1,800 traffic reporters, with radio and TV affiliates in all of the major US markets. On April 29, 2011, Westwood One sold Metro Networks to iHeartMedia (then known as Clear Channel Communications) for $119.25 million so it can concentrate on their other properties. Clear Channel combined Metro Networks with its own Total Traffic Networks.SEC filing of sale of Metro Networks to Clear Channel posted April 29, 2011 (SEC.gov) Metro Networks' traffic service was eventually folded into Total Traffic Networks later that year, with Clear Channel keeping the Total Traffic name for the operation.

He murdered seven people‚Äìincluding three policemen‚Äîduring a period of around 14 months, and wounded at least a dozen others. At age 34, Adams was surrounded and then killed by police in Wichita, Kansas. Early life Edward J. \\"Eddie\\" Adams was born in 1887 on a farm in Hutchinson, Kansas as William Joseph Wallace. His father died when he was young and his mother remarried. He had a strong disdain for his stepfather, as well as for physical labour. He learned the barber trade and moved to Wichita in the early 20th century. There he met John Callahan and quickly became involved in bootlegging, petty robberies, and car theft. Adams was handsome and charismatic, and attracted many women and hangers-on. His wife left him after growing weary of his illegal activities and infidelities. He soon formed his own gang and began committing bank and train robberies throughout Kansas, Missouri, and Iowa, eventually earning a reputation as the premier bandit in the Midwest by the early days of Prohibition. Murder & Kansas City In 1920, through Callahan, Adams formed a partnership with outlaw brothers Ray and Walter Majors and, on September 5, attempted a daylight robbery against a notorious Kansas City gambling den on Grand Avenue owned by Harry Trusdell. However, a shootout between the bandits and tough employees of the illegal casino would result in the death of gambler and gunman Frank Gardner and the eventual capture of the gang by police. Adams was sentenced to life imprisonment in February 1921. The Majors brothers received lesser sentences by agreeing to plead guilty to robbery, and were both sentenced to five years' imprisonment. Both brothers would eventually die in prison. A third Majors brother involved in the botched robbery attempt, Dudley, escaped from the scene only to be later arrested and serve time in Delaware. Midwest crime spree While being transported to the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City, Missouri, Adams escaped custody by jumping off the train and several days later joined Julius Finney in the robbery of a bank and general store in Cullison, Kansas on February 11, 1921. He was captured on February 17, 1921 near Garden Plain, Kansas by a posse, after wrecking a stolen car under a bridge. Convicted of bank robbery, Adams was sentenced to serve 10 to 30 years at the Kansas State Penitentiary in Lansing, in addition to his life sentence in Missouri for murder. On August 13, Adams once again successfully escaped imprisonment after sabotaging the prison power plant and scaling the prison walls during the night, along with inmates Frank Foster, George Weisberger and D.C. Brown. The driver of the getaway car was Billy Fintelman, a World War I veteran who had turned to a life of crime. With the exception of Brown (who was recaptured days later), the fugitives would elude capture from state authorities and eventually formed what would become the newest incarnation of the Adams Gang. By September of that year, joined by Fintelman, the gang robbed around $10,000 from banks in Rose Hill and Haysville, Kansas. During the Haysville robbery, Adams pistol- whipped 82-year-old James Krievell for no apparent reason, who later died of a fractured skull. On October 8, police attempted to trap the gang near Anoly, Kansas, however the gang managed to escape after a gunfight which left Deputy Benjamin Fisher wounded. The gang was spotted eleven days later after stealing $500 in silver from a bank near Osceola, Iowa. This was followed by another attempt by a posse to apprehend the gang just south of Murray, Iowa, where the gang rested for several hours along a gravel road just a few miles from town. Having spotted the gang's vehicle, suspicious farmer C.J. Jones contacted Murray Sheriff Ed West, and a group was formed to investigate and intervene. Upon approaching the vehicle, Sheriff West was met at point blank range with a revolver to his face that failed to fire. He was able to take cover and a shootout followed in which several members of the posse were seriously injured. Jones, having heard the gun battle from his farm up the road, grabbed his shotgun and ran to aid sheriff West and his group. The gang, who had by now fled from the original site, drove up the road and exchanged fire with Jones, which left him mortally wounded. Heading for Wichita, the gang's crime spree continued robbing 11 stores in Muscotah, Kansas and abducting and later robbing two motorcycle officers outside Wichita, where their motorcycles were set on fire. Back in Wichita, on November 5, 1921, Adams shot and killed Patrolman A.L. Young in cold blood while Young was on duty. The motive behind the killing was said to be a mutual love interest who had chosen the company of the officer over the outlaw. The gang then committed their most successful robbery with the theft of $35,000 after robbing a Santa Fe express train near Ottawa, Kansas. Downfall This is a re-enactment of Adam's fatal shootout with the police, as published in the Wichita Eagle, November 23, 1921. On the evening of November 20, 1921, Adams, along with Foster, Nellie Miles (a local madam and long-time friend of Adams), George J. McFarland (a local thug and bootlegger), and two alleged prostitutes, were joyriding around Wichita. Another car carrying Fintelman, his wife, Weisberger, P.D. Orcutt, and two unnamed ladies, followed at high speeds. Two motorcycle policemen pulled over the vehicle carrying Adams and a gunshot came from the vehicle‚Äîit is unknown whether the shot was fired by Adams or Foster‚Äîkilling patrolman Robert Fitzpatrick. The outlaws sped away, released the women, and fled south into Cowley County. Later that night, the trio ran out of gas and stopped at a farm, where Adams attempted to steal a vehicle from farmer George Oldham. When Oldham resisted, Adams shot and killed him. Adams and Foster took the car, while McFarland ran away alone into the night. The duo returned to Wichita in the stolen car. The next day, Adams and Billy Fintelman went to McFarland's house to look for him, only to find two officers waiting. Adams shot officer Ray Casner non-fatally while the other policeman hid under a bed. Adams once again escaped. Adams hid out until the funeral of fallen officer Fitzpatrick on November 22, at which he assumed the bulk of the police force would be present. He had planned to rent a car to leave town for good, but the proprietor of the garage recognized him and contacted police. Three officers arrived on the scene. Adams shot at them, fatally wounding detective Charles Hoffman, who had pulled Adams to the ground. Officer Charles Bowman was also hit by gunfire. D.C. Stuckey, hiding behind a pillar, shot Adams three times and killed him. Eddie Adams' body was publicly displayed in the City Undertaking Parlor in a grisly celebration of the end of a reign of terror. More than 9,000 people viewed the slain outlaw. In the end, 18 people were arrested as accomplices and hangers-on of Adams. Four were sent to the Kansas State Penitentiary, including Frank Foster, who was sentenced to remain there for life.

Its southern terminus is at Route 106 in Kingston and its northern terminus is at Route 4 in Chelmsford. Along the way it intersects several major highways including Route 24 in Brockton, U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Walpole, Route 9 in Natick, US 20 in Wayland, and Route 2 in Acton. Route description The Isaac Davis Monument in Acton, located along Route 27 Route 27 runs in a sweeping arc from Kingston to Chelmsford. For most of its route, it acts as an intermediate route between Interstate 95 and Interstate 495. Route 27 begins in Kingston at Route 106, approximately 1-1/4 miles west of Route 3. It heads northwest towards Brockton, passing through Pembroke, Hanson, East Bridgewater and Whitman. In Brockton the road shares a triple concurrency with Route 28 and Route 123 Eastbound (Route 123 Westbound only intersects with the route). From the center of town, Route 27 heads northwest, past the Westgate Mall, over Route 24 at Exits 18A-B, and past Good Samaritan Hospital before passing into Norfolk County via Stoughton. In Stoughton, the road has a brief concurrency with Route 138 in the center of town. It passes just south of the town of Canton before making a large loop through the town of Sharon. It crosses over Interstate 95 without access, between Exits 9 and 10, both of which are accessible via US Route 1 nearby. It then crosses through Walpole and Medfield before crossing the Charles River into Middlesex County and the town of Sherborn. In Sherborn, the road begins a more northerly direction, with a short concurrency with Route 16 in the center of town. The road heads through the center of Natick, passing the town green and crossing Route 135, which carries the Boston Marathon at that point. Route 27 crosses over Route 9 with a four-way exit ramp system, just east of Lake Cochituate, the Natick Mall and the Golden Triangle retail area. Route 27 passes into Wayland and under the Massachusetts Turnpike, which it accesses via Route 30, just north of the Pike. In Wayland, Route 27 has a 1.2-mile concurrency with Route 126, passing through the center of town and intersecting US Route 20. The road then crosses the Sudbury River into Sudbury and through the historic town center. It passes into Maynard, having a short, 0.1-mile concurrency with Route 62 over the Assabet River, before heading north into Acton. It crosses Route 2 at Exit 42 before crossing through the town center, past the Isaac Davis Monument. It sweeps by Carlisle before directly crossing into Westford, passing through the southeast corner of town before heading into Chelmsford. Route 27 ends at the center of town, at the intersection of Routes 4, 110 and 129, just south of Interstate 495 and U.S. Route 3.  History  Route 27's original form was identical to the modern route south of Wayland, with the exception of a bypass built in 1963 from the Charles River at the Sherborn-Medfield line to Route 109 in Medfield center. North of Wayland the route followed current Route 126 into Concord. It came into its current form by 1939. However, historical maps from the U.S. Department of the Interior from 1943 show Route 27 running concurrent with US 20 from Wayland Center to Concord Road in Sudbury, then following Concord Road to Sudbury Center, where it resumed its current alignment on Hudson Road.http://docs.unh.edu/towns/SudburyMassachusettsMapList.htm Major intersections Southbound entering Medfield Junction of US 20, MA 27 & MA 126 Granite road sign in Sudbury.

Named for British prime minister William Pitt the Younger, the act provided for the appointment of a Board of Control, and provided for a joint government of British India by the Company and the Crown with the government holding the ultimate authority. A six member board of control was set up for political activities and Court of directors for financial/commercial activities. As the Regulating Act had many defects, it was necessary to pass another Act to remove these defects. Provisions of the 1784 Act The Act provided for not more than six Privy Counsellors, including a Secretary of State and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be appointed \\"Commissioners for the Affairs of India\\". Of these, not fewer than three formed a Board to execute the powers under the Act. The Board was presided over by the president, who soon effectively became the minister for the affairs of the East India Company. Section 3 of the Act provided that the President was to be the Secretary of State, or failing that, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or failing that, the most senior of the other Commissioners. The Act stated that the Board would henceforth \\"superintend, direct and control\\" the government of the Company's possessions,John Keay, The Honourable Company.

The Board was supported by a Chief Secretary. The governing council of the Company was reduced to three members. The governors of Bombay and Madras were also deprived of their independence. The governor-general was given greater powers in matters of war, revenue and diplomacy. The Act also stated that to pursue schemes of conquest and extension of dominion in India are measures repugnant to the wish, the honour and the policy of this nation.Darwin, John. 2012. Unfinished Empire. Penguin. pp. 124 (This would later change with the rise of Napoleon and French interest in India). By a supplementary act passed in 1786 Lord Cornwallis was appointed as the 2nd governor-general of Bengal, and he then became the effective ruler of British India under the authority of the Board of Control and the Court of Directors.

History Since 1947, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessor agencies have moved nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons components, and special nuclear materials by a variety of commercial and government transportation modes. In the late 1960s, worldwide terrorism and acts of violence prompted a review of procedures for safeguarding these materials. As a result, a comprehensive new series of regulations and equipment was developed to enhance the safety and security of these materials in transit. The Transportation Safeguards Division (TSD), renamed Office of Secure Transportation (OST) in the late 1990s, was subsequently established in 1975 at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Albuquerque Operations Office. The OST modified and redesigned transport equipment to incorporate features that effectively enhance self-protection and deny unauthorized access to the materials. It was during this time that OST curtailed the use of commercial transportation systems and moved to a total federal operation. Since its establishment in 1975, OST has accumulated over 100 million miles of over-the- road experience transporting DOE-owned cargo with no accidents causing a fatality or release of radioactive material. There have been accidents, however. In November 1996, after 13 years of accident-free travel, a convoy in western Nebraska encountered an unexpected ice storm. A tractor-trailer in the convoy skidded off the road and rolled onto its side, jostling its cargo of two nuclear bombs.  Operations  OST-classified shipments are now conducted in a low profile, no-notice manner to ensure the security and safety of the cargo. The personnel who operate the transportation vehicles and the escort vehicles are federal agents. The OST annual budget is about $250 million. =Travel restrictions = The OST attempts to ensure its convoys do not travel during periods of inclement weather. The OST monitors weather from their operations center and weather checks are performed every two hours. If the convoys are going to encounter or do encounter adverse weather, provisions exist for the convoys to seek shelter at previously identified facilities. As an additional travel precaution, the OST has imposed a maximum 65 miles-per- hour speed limit on its convoys, even if the posted limit is greater. Although OST provides sleeper berths in all vehicles, federal agents (couriers) accompanying shipments are not to exceed 32 hours of continuous travel without then having 8 hours of uninterrupted, stationary bed rest. =Staffing= As of 2017, OST employed 322 couriers. It seeks to hire military veterans, particularly ex-special-operations forces. Besides dealing with \\"irregular hours, personal risks, and exposure to inclement weather,\\" agents \\"may be called upon to use deadly force if necessary to prevent the theft, sabotage or takeover of protected materials by unauthorized persons.\\" (Note: published in the May/June 2012 issue of Mother Jones magazine, pg. 5) =Monitoring= The OST operates a nationwide communications system located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This system, known as the Transportation and Emergency Control Center (TECC), monitors the status and location of shipments and maintains real-time communications 24-hours a day with every convoy. TECC is the first line in the support of convoys. Through an active liaison program, the DOE maintains an emergency contact directory of federal and state response organizations located throughout the contiguous United States. During a convoy emergency, an open communications line is established and maintained between the control center and the appropriate state agencies. This way a continuous update of information from the scene can be relayed to the responding units. OST has established procedures should a law enforcement officer stop an OST vehicle. The liaison program provides law enforcement officers information to assist them in recognizing one of these vehicles should it be involved in an accident and what actions to take in conjunction with the actions of the federal agents. In the case of emergency event that threatened the cargo of an OST safeguards shipment, DOE would declare a National Security Area (NSA), which temporarily places an area under effective control of the DOE/NNSA. A National Security Area is defined as an area established within the United States and used for the purpose of safeguarding classified, sensitive, and/or restricted data to protect DOE/NNSA equipment and/or material. The CCIC at the scene will define the boundary, mark it with a physical barrier, and post warning signs. The declaration of a National Security Area does not relieve state and local authorities of their responsibilities for the area surrounding the NSA, to include evacuations or other protective actions as needed. =Emergency response= DOE has a system of emergency response including initial notification, monitoring and assessment of the situation, and working with other agencies to resolve the emergency. In the event of a vehicle accident involving a Safe Secure Trailer (SST) or Safeguards Transporter (SGT), the local responders (e.g., police, sheriff, state trooper, fire department, etc.), after the initial interface with the federal agents, will be asked to meet with the CCIC to discuss the situation and the best way to solve it.

The \\"Writer‚Äôs Club\\" expressed interest in \\"folksongs and literary material to be found in Missouri,\\" as reported in the M.S.U. Independent on March 6, 1903. The State Historical Society of Missouri had recently opened its library in what is now Jesse Hall, and the cultural moment had arrived for the development of a new academic field which would blend the materials and methods of many traditional disciplines ‚Äì philology, literature and history‚Äîas well as connecting to the newer fields of sociology and anthropology. In literature, the movement that would come to be known as ‚Äúlocal color‚Äù and the political disposition known as populism worked together to prosper an interest in what Ralph Waldo Emerson had called for, long ago, in a genuinely American literary culture: rejecting ‚Äúthe courtly muses of Europe‚Äù in favor of ‚Äúthe near, the low, the common.‚Äù The students of the English Club conceived of what would now be called a project in fieldwork and salvage ethnography; aware that sociological trends did not favor the preservation of materials of limited distribution and held in oral tradition, and probably feeling, as some Midwestern students perhaps continue to do, that their own culture hardly qualified as such in the eyes of more prestigious institutions on the Eastern seaboard, they proposed to gather the lore of Missouri into bound volumes, as an archive for future researchers. This collection project, with leadership from the English Club's faculty sponsor, Henry Marvin Belden and its secretary-treasurer, Maude Williams, would form the basis for the Society's single most-cited work, Ballads and Songs Collected by the Missouri Folklore Society, published in 1940 (second edition, 1955; reprinted 1966 and 1973). The collection project was an item of discussion at the 1905 meeting of the Modern Language Society in Chicago, where the fact that ancient ballads continued to be sung in rural areas was received as something of a revelation, though one to which the ‚Äúpopular antiquities‚Äù orientation of incipient folklore studies was favorably disposed. In addition to a very local sort of patriotism, the primary warrant for preserving a given text was that it could be traced to a prior tradition (especially one documentable in the British Isles, ideally in Thomas Percy‚Äôs 1765 Reliques of Ancient English Poetry or the English and Scottish Popular Ballads (1882-98) of Francis James Child. Belden published results of his students‚Äô researches in Modern Philology and the Journal of American Folklore, and the club had achieved sufficient stability as to establish itself officially on December 15, 1906. The innovations here are numerous: the recognition of fieldwork as an academic enterprise, the development of collection and archiving protocols, and the participation of undergraduates in original research (a novelty which lies behind such projects as the Foxfire books, Bittersweet and The Chariton Collector). Early proceedings indicate keen awareness of the dual orientations of the society, both to literature and to anthropology. From an early date, there was recognition of the need to collect the lore of the state's Black and Native American communities. The Missouri Folklore Society provided the impetus (and expertise) for other such organizations, notably the Texas Folklore Society. Belden became prominent in national folklore circles, serving as president of the American Folklore Society and working closely with such period luminaries as the anthropologist Franz Boas and the literary scholar George Lyman Kittredge ‚Äì again testifying to the new discipline's divided identity. Unfortunately, nothing came of the American Folklore Society's plans, much discussed in 1917, to publish the Missouri collection (which was substantially what it would be on its 1940 appearance). The Society did not participate in the virtual explosion of amateur and academic activity, the formation of organizations and the implementation of collection projects, which extended through the 1920s and 30s. As a result of a combination of factors, including disappointment over the derailment of the organization's signature project, but perhaps primarily because of a failure of continuity in leadership and philosophy, the Society \\"fell into a coma in 1920 from which it has not recovered.\\" Belden became increasingly busy with administrative duties and other research projects, as was the case too with what then seemed a fine choice for Belden's successor, Archer Taylor. Mary Alicia Owen, the most prominent of early Missouri collectors and for decades a leader in the Society, did not share Belden's focused enthusiasm for folksong, preferring to cast the net much more broadly. Mary Alicia Owen Missouri Folklore Society For these and other reasons, the Society as such effectively went silent until 1977, though Missouri folklorists certainly remained active, and Missouri folklore continued to be collected and studied by such as Ward Dorrance, Vance Randolph, Joseph Carri√®re, R.P. Christeson, Rosemary Thomas and others. A group consisting mainly of University of Missouri faculty met on March 30, 1977 for the re- activation of the Society. The re-incarnation of MFS, led by Adolph and Rebecca Schroeder, Don Holliday and Cathy Barton (among others), was well- prepared with broad publicity and grass-roots participation from throughout the state. The basic frameworks for the annual Missouri Folklore Society Journal (long edited by Donald Lance) and the statewide meeting, to be held each year in a different part of the state, with such prominent keynote speakers as Roger Abrahams and Max Hunter, were established. Perhaps most importantly for the continued existence and success of the Society, there was an explicit recognition of the need to participate in multiple networks of likeminded organizations (for example the Ozarks States Folklore Society), and above all to recognize the legitimate participation of a variety of constituencies and stakeholders in folklore: academic scholars, certainly, but also performers, tradition-bearers, informants -- \\"amateurs\\" in the truest and best sense of the word. Each annual meeting has had presentations and participation by such scholars of international standing as John Miles Foley, Elaine Lawless, Barry Bergey, Alain Jabbour and Jan Harold Brunvand, as well as reports on collection-efforts by students and members of local historical societies, remembrance sessions, presentations on crafts, and music sessions. The Society has, at the century mark, its largest membership in history, a well-trafficked website which includes a growing repository of studies and documents (Missouri Folklore Studies) and a journal now well past the quarter- century mark.

He was accused of failing to enforce Prop 227, informing parents of their rights under the new law to opt for bilingual education for their children. He sued to challenge the use of English-only recall petitions as a violation of the Voting Rights Act, and won in the Ninth Circuit federal appeals court, although the case is not yet resolved. Another issue involved in the recall campaign was the proposed construction of an elementary school in the wealthiest side of Santa Ana, but opposed by the majority wealthy Republican and conservative constituency of the city. Lopez was recalled by 71% of the voters and lost every single one of the 16 precincts were the ballots were cast, including areas with majority Latino voters. Lopez, backed by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, filed a lawsuit against the petition and recall process, claiming the English-only petitions violated the Voting Rights Act. California began providing Spanish-language ballots statewide in 2002, and local jurisdictions also provide multilingual election materials. But petitions, which are written by ordinary people hoping to change laws from the grass-roots level, are often available in English only.https://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/19/local/me-initiative19 The initial suit, Padilla v. Lever, sought to prevent the recall election from proceeding. The suit unsuccessfully sought an injunction to prevent the election from occurring, after the petition signatures had been collected and certified by Orange County elections officials. The district court denied the injunction. After the recall election took place and Lopez was recalled, the plaintiffs appealed to a 3-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit . There, the idea that the recall election was illegal was originally upheld, although an en banc panel later overturned that decision. Lopez assisted in organizing the 2006 United States immigration reform protests, both the March 25, 2006 demonstration of between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people in Los Angeles, and the Great American Boycott on May 1, 2006, which involved between 500,000 and about 1,000,000 people in Los Angeles.ABC News article dated 1 May 2006: 1M Immigrants Skip Work for Demonstration CNN article dated 12 December 2003: California Latino groups urge boycottCNN article dated 30 April 2006: Millions expected to join walkoutCNN article dated 30 April 2006: Quick Guide & Transcript: Immigrants launch nationwide boycotts, Student robotics competition On April 13, 2006, Lopez appeared on Lou Dobbs' television show, where he argued that \\"illegal immigrant\\" is an offensively racist term on par with \\"wop,\\" \\"nigger,\\" or \\"kike.\\" =Voter registration fraud= In 2009, Lopez was charged by the Los Angeles District Attorney's office with eight felony counts, including voter-registration fraud, perjury, filing a false instrument, and fraudulent voting.Martin Wisckol, Activist Nativo Lopez pleads guilty to voter fraud, Orange County Register (June 22, 2011). In 2008, although Lopez lived at his Santa Ana home, he switched his voter registration to the Boyle Heights, Los Angeles office of Hermandad Mexicana Latinoamericana, the group he led, and allegedly cast an illegal ballot in Los Angeles County in the 2008 presidential primary, rather than Orange County. In court, Lopez was engaged in \\"a tumultuous judicial process, with Lopez jailed twice after conflicts with judges.\\" He underwent several hearings and evaluations to determine his mental competency to stand trial, and abruptly fired his lawyer and chose to represent himself in mid-2009. Finally, in 2011, in an agreement with prosecutors, Lopez pleaded guilty to one felony count of voter registration fraud. The seven other felony charges were dropped. Lopez was sentenced to one year of probation by Judge William C. Ryan, and ordered to perform 400 hours of community service. Lopez died on May 19, 2019, aged 67 he is survived by 3 daughters, and a son.

He is a former Mafia enforcer and associate of Antonio \\"Tony Twist\\" Twistelli, the Don of New York, and is now a vigilante seeking revenge on The Family. Background Richard Masullo was always the muscle, from his days with his brother David till his time with Twist. When he wanted out of the mob Twistelli had him captured and shipped to Germany where he was used as the guinea pig for Project: TREMOR, the mafia's first attempt to create a supersoldier. This was the predecessor of the highly successful OvertKill project. Richard was subjected to numerous experiments, mostly gene manipulation but spliced with some cybernetics. The result appeared more demonic than human. The newly dubbed \\"Tremor\\" was a failure, as his free will and disgust for what he had become overwhelmed any type of loyalty he had for the mafia. As a result, Twist killed the rest of Tremor's family except for his brother David. Not long afterwards an enraged Tremor broke free from the laboratory. Twist told David that Tremor was the one who slaughtered his family, including Richard, and David went to work hunting Tremor across the globe. Role in the Story Tremor arrived in New York and heard news of dealings between Spawn and Twist. While trekking the globe he had been taking out facilities belonging to Twist. This work continued in New York. He attacked Spawn, mistaking him for an ally of the mob. The two came to a sort of understanding and teamed together to go after Twist. They slashed through Twist's men and almost took him out, but David stepped in and fought against Tremor. As Richard revealed himself to his brother, David couldn't understand or believe what was going on because of his own guilt and his hatred for Tremor and began to unload his weapon into him. This wounded Tremor but due to his mutated, cybernetically enhanced condition the damage was only minor. Spawn only saw part of what had happened and attacked David, severely injuring his leg and enraging Tremor. This led to a falling out between the duo and what has been a very uneasy tension between them since. The character has been the basis for several action figures. Recent Whereabouts Tremor has been notably absent from the book for a very long time. This is most likely because of the legal issues surrounding the Tony Twist character, since Tremor's role in the book is to chase after Twist. Todd McFarlane has also stated in the past that he feels the character is very \\"cartoony\\" and thus not suited for current storylines. Tremor made a cameo as a new member of the Image comics team, The Brigade, and more information on this part of his usage in comics is being investigated. Tremor supposedly made a brief cameo in the latest Spawn arc, however the Tremor that appeared to Spawn while he was being tortured by Thamuz was instead a low-level demon under the guise of an illusion caused by Thamuz' magic. He later shows up in the JIm Dowing Saga as a normal man. He later appears in Spawn #297 See also * Spawn villains References Comics characters introduced in 1994 Fictional cyborgs Spawn characters Fictional mobsters Fictional vigilantes Characters created by Todd McFarlane Image Comics supervillains Image Comics superheroes ","title":"Tremor (comics)"},{"id":"5711128","text":"Ficimia streckeri, also commonly known as the Mexican hooknose snake, the Tamaulipan hooknose snake, and the Texas hook-nosed snake, is a small species of snake in the family Colubridae. The species is native to northeastern Mexico and adjacent southern Texas. Etymology The specific name or epithet, streckeri, is in honor of the American naturalist John Kern Strecker Jr.Beltz, Ellin (2006). Scientific and Common Names of the Reptiles and Amphibians of North America - Explained. www.ebeltz.net/herps/biogappx.html#S.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Ficimia streckeri, p. 256). Geographic range F. streckeri is found primarily in the Mexican states of Hidalgo, Nuevo Le√≥n, Puebla, eastern San Luis Potos√≠, and Tamaulipas, but its geographic range extends as far north as southern Texas in the United States. Description The Mexican hooknose snake is usually in total length (including tail). H.M. Smith and Brodie (1982) report a maximum total length of 47.9 cm (almost 19 inches).Smith HM, Brodie ED Jr (1982). Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. New York: Golden Press. 240 pp. . (Ficimia streckeri, pp. 174-175). It is typically brown or gray in color, with as many as 60 brown or brown-green blotches down the back, which are elongated to almost appear as stripes. Its underside is white or cream-colored. Its most distinctive feature is an upturned snout, much like hognose snakes, which gives it its common name. However, unlike hognose snakes, Mexican hooknose snakes have smooth dorsal scales. Also distinctive is the arrangement of the head shields. There are no internasals, and the rostral separates the prefrontals and contacts the frontal.Schmidt KP, Davis DD (1941). Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. 365 pp. (Ficimia streckeri, p. 203). The smooth dorsal scales are arranged in 17 rows at midbody. Ventrals 126-155, subcaudals 28-41. Behavior The Mexican hooknose snake is mostly nocturnal, and is a burrower.Wright AH, Wright AA (1957). Handbook of Snakes of the United States and Canada. Ithaca and London: Comstock. 1,105 pp. (in 2 volumes) (Ficimia olivacea streckeri, pp. 279-282, Figure 86, Map 26).Conant R (1975).

Boston: Houghton Mifflin. 429 pp. (Ficimia streckeri, pp. 216-217 + Plate 33 + Map 160). It is fairly slow-moving and harmless to humans. Diet The diet of F. streckeri consists primarily of spiders and centipedes.Behler JL, King FW (1979). The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Reptiles and Amphibians. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. 743 pp., 657 color plates. . (Ficimia streckeri, pp. 611‚Äì612 + Plate 547). Habitat The Mexican hooknose snake inhabits woodlands along the Rio Grande river plain, near natural and man-made sources of water.Powell R, Conant R, Collins JT(2016). Peterson Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Fourth Edition. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. xiv + 494 pp. 47 color plates, 207 Figures. . (Ficimia streckeri, pp. 374‚Äì375 + Plate 33). Defense The primary form of defense of F. streckeri is making a popping sound by expanding its cloaca when harassed or handled.

Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter, featuring the fictional sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian created by Robert E. Howard. It was first published by Lancer Books in the paperback collection Conan of Cimmeria (1969), which was reprinted several times, first by Lancer and later by Ace Books through 1993. It has also been published by Sphere Books in the omnibus paperback collection The Conan Chronicles (1989). Plot summary Conan, having been exiled after a drought struck his Bamula tribe and murdering the high priest who blamed him for it, journeys across the savannah of Kush. He instinctively feels that something is watching him, but sees nothing. However, he is being followed by a pack of hungry lions. An hour later, an exhausted Conan has fought off three lion attacks and is out of arrows. He runs through the darkness, with a lioness lapping at his heel, as a beam of moonlight peeks out from behind the clouds. Soon, Conan realizes the lions have stopped their pursuit as the vast plain mysteriously ends. Suddenly, Conan finds himself within the center of a giant circle of dead vegetation. At the edge, the lions simply look on as Conan examines his surroundings. Not knowing how long the lions will be kept at bay by whatever force is preventing them from crossing into the circle, Conan travels deeper into the dead area. Soon, he discovers a ruined castle. As a storm begins forming right above him, Conan realizes his only shelter is the crumbled and misshapen structure ahead of him. Conan makes his way inside the ruined building, noting the black onyx stone and bizarre architecture before him. In fact, the halls and stairs appear to be built for a creature larger than human-sized while strange carvings riddle the walls. Conan wonders if perhaps this was an ancient citadel of the long-extinct Serpent Men he has heard of in legends. Conan sleeps peacefully as the storm passes overhead, frequently jerking awake with his sword at the ready, seeming to hear whispering voices. He becomes convinced that the shadows are ghosts unsuccessfully trying to devour him. He's unaware that in one corner of the castle, the shadows are converging into a sentient mass which is planning to consume him. Meanwhile, a band of Stygian slave traders are searching the savannah for tribesmen to capture. Caught in a violent storm, the men spy the castle in the distance and make their way towards shelter. They burst inside and distract the shadowy black mass that was slowly approaching Conan. Conan, now awake and contemplating the horror he had finally noticed, hides in the shadows while watching as the Stygians eat, drink, and finally fall asleep, with one standing guard. As the sentinel stands, back to his sleeping companions, a hideous shape made from the spirits of a thousand dead souls appears in the center of their camp. The monstrosity, with a hundred heads and a dozen feet and arms, throws itself onto a sleeping Stygian and rips him to shreds. The Stygians rise up and attack the beast to no avail, as it methodically kills one after another. Conan, still hiding, decides to leave the scene while the monster is distracted by climbing out a window. He finds the slavers' horses and begins to mount one, when a lone Stygian, driven mad by his experience, bursts out of the castle. Conan is forced to kill the man to end his insanity. Soon, Conan hears the shuffling of movement towards the door. He doesn't wait to see who or what comes out, swiftly taking the Stygian's armor and spurring his horse into a gallop far away from the cursed castle.

The song tells a story about a rock and roller whose guitar is shipped to Oriole, Kentucky, instead of Memphis. The track peaked at No. 10 in the UK Singles Chart. Although it did not chart in the United States, it did receive considerable airplay on album-oriented rock stations. The Mott album, from which it was released, reached the Top 40 of the Billboard 200, peaking at No. 35. Background and lyrics The musician gets half-way to Memphis before he realizes his guitar is missing. It takes a month to track it down. When he gets the guitar back, he is scolded by a stranger for being neglectful and self-centered. In the original version of the song, the stranger is referred to as a \\"spade\\", in later versions the word \\"dude\\" is substituted. The song reflects a weariness with the rock and roll life-style, including the strain of constant touring and the low public opinion of rock 'n' roll singers. This theme appears in the chorus, which is repeated with minor variations: \\"you look like a star, but you're still on the dole,\\" \\"you look like a star, but you're really out on parole.\\" The song may have been based on an actual event involving guitarist Mick Ralphs. The song was used in the films Breaking the Waves and Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. The loss of Ralphs's guitar is also mentioned in the lyrics of the single's B-side, \\"Ballad of Mott the Hoople (26th March 1972, Z√ºrich)\\". Name-checking most of the band's then members, the B-side's lyrics stated \\"Buffin lost his child-like dreams\\" / And \\"Mick lost his guitar / And Verden grew a line or two / And Overend's just a rock 'n' roll star\\". Cover versions and tributes \\"All the Way from Memphis\\" was covered by Brian May on his 1998 album Another World; Hunter guested on this cover. It was also covered by supergroup Contraband on their only album (1991). The British rock band Thunder also performed a live version appearing on multiple compilation albums. The British punk band Abdoujaparov covered the track on their 2002 album Air Odeon Disco Pub. Swedish artist Magnus Uggla has stated that he was inspired by the song when he wrote his first hit single \\"Varning p√• stan\\" (later recorded in English as \\"Hit the Girls on the Run\\") in 1977.

He is best known as the bassist and co-lead vocalist of American ska-punk band Less Than Jake. Lima also performs as the lead singer and rhythm guitarist of punk rock band Rehasher, and has another band called Greenhorn. Less Than Jake Lima (October 31, 1973, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) is the second bassist for Less Than Jake (replacing original bassist Shaun Grief) and has appeared on all of Less Than Jake's albums. Previously a guitar player, he played bass for the first time when he joined the band. In addition to playing bass, he shares singing duties with Chris DeMakes.

Occasionally, he has also played the second guitar onstage with Less Than Jake - for example, when performing \\"Last Hour of the Last Day of Work\\" or \\"The Brightest Bulb Has Burned Out/Screws Fall Out.\\" He has been known to be the most conspicuous member of the group due to his charismatic stage presence and his dreadlock hairstyle. For bass equipment, Roger currently uses Eden Electronics amplifiers and cabinets, Music Man Sterling basses in various colors, and Ernie Ball strings. Rehasher Lima formed Rehasher in 2000 with members of Army of Ponch and Savage Brewtality. Rehasher was a return to his roots from the more serious, popular, Less than Jake. He is more proactive as a member of Rehasher‚Äîas their lead singer, rhythm guitarist, songwriter, lyricist, and producer. In addition to this, in Rehasher's latest album Lima has been responsible for tracking all the guitar parts as well as the bass ones, hence assuming the roles previously belonging to band members Ryan Geis and Gui Amador (though neither of these members have quit Rehasher). Unfortunately, Lima is only able to work with Rehasher when Less than Jake has time off. Rehasher's second album was released in vinyl form on August 28, 2009; and in CD form on October 27, 2009. Greenhorn Lima began another side project in 2014 with Jen Vito from the band No More. Greenhorn as the duo is called released a six song EP on anchorless records called \\"I Want More \\".

He uses Pro Tools for his recording purposes, and his services include mixing, recording, producing, etc. He also has a range of instruments and gear available to those who wish to record at his studio. In 2009, with the launch of Rehasher's new album, High Speed Access to My Brain, Moathouse made a debut as a record label in addition to its existing function as a studio.

The temple was built by king Srikara Bhanja who ascended the throne of Ghumusar in 1790 CE. The image of God Biranchinarayan, which is installed in the sanctum of the temple, was recovered from the ruins of Malatigarh. About the finding of the statues, Sewell in his Ghumusar Report has stated that once a herdboy, while tending cattle, struck his foot against a plate of metal at the foot of the hill. Consequently, the villagers dug up the portion and unearthed a life- size image of Suryanarayan which was carried to Buguda where it was consecrated in a new temple. The temple subsequently came to be known as Biranchinarayan. The temple is built in the form of a chariot driven by seven horses.

Technology  In 2017, Panasonic Avionics decided to cancel planned investment in geostationary satellites, in the wake of development in low earth orbit satellite constellations . This decision could be due to potential future competition from the Starlink and OneWeb satellite constellations. One of the key technical differences is that low earth orbit satellites provide shorter latencies, because the signal doesn't have to travel 35,786 km (22,236 mi) back and forth to the geostationary orbit.

The Curse in the book is a billionaire and a religious zealot who seeks a place in Heaven and knows far more about the war between Heaven and Hell than most on Earth. Fictional character biography The Curse, born Phillip Krahn, seeks a chance to lead Heaven's armies against the armies of Hell. When he was a boy he removed his own left eye and scarred his face with a large, deep scratch from a rusty metal fence running horizontally over his right eye. When he was older, he removed his right arm to show his dedication to God. He grew to become wealthy and studied the occult. He used technology to rebuild his arm, far stronger and better than it was before. He sought to gain Spawn's powers, believing him at first to be a soldier of Heaven, but Spawn destroyed his bionic arm and beat him severely, leaving the Curse crucified on a wall in Rat City to teach him and others that the alleys belong to Spawn. He was found and tortured by the demon-hunter, Sankser. The Curse escaped from the alleys and returned to his mansion where he began to plot his revenge and recuperate from his many injuries by combining cybernetics with demonic parts. Feeling his place in Heaven forever denied to him because of his failure to destroy Spawn he sought to gain all the knowledge of Hell so that he might overthrow Malebolgia and recreate Hell as his own Kingdom. He appeared later in the book, Curse of the Spawn, aiding and ultimately betraying Tony Twist before another apparent brush with death. He was hit by Twist's car and shot by numerous weapons as the volatile chemicals around his lab were also hit and the resulting explosion engulfed everyone involved. Given his penchant for survival, and the fact that he has never been shown to be in Hell as other Spawn villains before him (Kincaid, Freak, etc.) it is unlikely that The Curse is actually dead.

Overview  RM-70 was developed in Czechoslovakia as a successor for the RM-51, achieving initial operational capability with its Army in 1972. The launcher was being produced in Dubnica nad V√°hom (Slovakia). Originally, it was sold to East Germany. After the Soviet Union collapse and the split of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic, it was sold to several states in Africa, America, Asia and Europe. RM-70 replaced the Ural-375D 6x6 truck by a Tatra T813 \\"Kolos\\" 8x8 truck as carrier platform for the 40-round launcher. The new carrier vehicle provides enough space for carrying 40 additional 122mm rockets pack for reload. Nevertheless, RM-70 performance remains near the same as Grad even in terms of vehicle's speed and range. This rocket launcher can fire both individual rounds and volleys, principally by means of indirect fire. It is designed for concentrated fire coverage of large areas (up to 3 hectares in one volley) by high explosive fragmentation shells. The fire is robust with almost 256 kg of explosives used in one volley of 40 rockets. The rockets used are either the original Soviet 9M22 and 9M28, or locally developed models. These are the JROF with a range of 20.75 km, the JROF-K with a range of 11 km, the \\"Trnovnik\\" with 63 HEAT- bomblets and with a range of 17.5 km, the \\"Ku≈°\\" with five PPMI-S1 anti- personnel mines or the \\"Krizhna-R\\" with 4 anti-tank mines PTMI-D and with a range of 19,450 m. The vehicle is provided with a central tyre pressure regulation system (to allow its adaptation to the nature of the traversed ground), a headlight with white light on the forward cab roof and, if necessary, with a snow plough SSP 1000 or a dozer blade BZ-T to arrange its own emplacement or to remove obstacles.

Inversely, a common modern meaning is that a person must stay active to avoid stagnation. In English The conventional English translation appeared in John Heywood's collection of Proverbs in 1546. Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable also credits Erasmus, and relates it to other Latin proverbs, Planta quae saepius transfertus non coalescit or Saepius plantata arbor fructum profert exiguum, which mean that a frequently replanted plant or tree (respectively) yields little fruit.Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable , sub. title \\"Rolling Stone\\". It appears that the original intent of the proverb saw the growth of moss as desirable, and that the intent was to condemn mobility as unprofitable. The contemporary interpretation of equating moss to undesirable stagnation has turned the traditional understanding on its head. Erasmus's proverb gave the name \\"rolling stone\\" to people who are agile (mobile) and never get rusty due to constant motion. \\"A day in the moss\\" refers to cutting peat in bogs or mosses. Metaphorically, this refers to the hard work in preparation for winter. An itinerant \\"rolling stone\\" will not likely feel the timely need to apply for access to a community's peat bog.Dictionary of the Scots Language Sc. 1825 J. Mitchell Scotsman's Library 118: \\"Any gentleman, whether possessing property or not, who was popular, and ready to assist the poor in their difficulties, might expect a day in the moss, as they were wont to term it, and could have them longer for payment.\\" http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/moss Accuracy The saying may not be authentic to Syrus; the Latin form usually given, Saxum volutum non obducitur musco, does not appear in the edited texts of Publilius Syrus. It does, however, appear with similar wording in Erasmus' Adagia, which was first published around 1500.Adagia, Erasmus, at Bibliotheca Augustana. It is also given as \\"Musco lapis volutus haud obducitur\\", and in some cases as \\"Musco lapis volutus haud obvolvitur\\".Jer√≥nimo Mart√≠n Caro y Cejudo, Refranes, y modos de hablar castellanos (1792), p. 288 The literal meaning of the statement itself is true. The television show MythBusters showed that after six months of constantly rolling a stone does not grow moss. Annotated MythBusters In psychiatry Because it is so well known, this saying is one of the most common proverbs used in psychological tests for mental illness, particularly schizophrenia, to look for difficulty with abstraction. American researchClinical Manual for Proverbs Test, 1956, Dr Gorham, Missoula MT., Psychological Test Specialists conducted in the 1950s between Air Force basic airmen and hospitalized Veterans Administration patients with schizophrenia found that the way a person interprets proverbs can be used to determine abstraction ability. The lack of abstraction ability in these studies was statistically significantly higher in the VA patients and it has thus been construed as indicating pathology. As persons with mental illness are generally believed to demonstrate \\"concrete\\" thinking (a tendency to interpret abstract concepts literally) the research results have, in practice, often been improperly generalized to suggest proverbs alone can be a sufficient indicator of mental illness. A \\"concrete\\" interpretation of the proverb \\"a rolling stone gathers no moss\\" would simply restate the proverb in different words, rather than delivering any metaphorical meaning.\\"Proverb interpretation in forensic evaluations\\", William H.

Industry Ferrochrome Plant was initially commissioned in November 1969 as a division of IDCOL with an installed manufacturing capacity of 12,000 MT p.a. of High Carbon Ferro Chrome (HCFC) with reduction furnace. Subsequently, additional capacity of 10,000 MT p.a. of Low Carbon Ferro Chrome (LCFC) with slag furnace was created in October 1970. However, due to entry of relatively cheaper South African ferrochrome and general slow down in the demand of LCFC, IDCOL decided to stop the production of LCFC and with minor modifications, converted its slag furnace into reduction furnace in July 1998, so as to produce an additional 6,000 MT p.a. of HCFC. With this, the total installed capacity of the HCFC stood at 18,000 MT p.a. The current installed capacity is 19,000 MT p.a. The rated capacity of the furnaces are 9 MVA and 6.5 MVA. The plant was taken over by IFCAL in April, 2002. The operations at the Ferrochrome plant include mining of chrome ore from open cast mines, beneficiation of ore and smelting. The production process involves reduction of chromium oxide to chromium by electric arc furnace to produce HCFC by further reduction of the metallic oxide with the help of carbon.

The character became a mainstay on the series for over 10 years. He was known for his relationships with Traci Abbott, Ashley Abbott and Victoria Newman, as well as his business rivalries with Jack Abbott and Victor Newman. In 2009, the character drowned in a frozen lake. Casting and portrayal Don Diamont portrayed the role of Brad for the character's entire run on the series. He first appeared on April 7, 1985, as the new Abbott family gardener. In 1993, the role was temporarily recast to Russell Todd. The character also briefly crossed over to The Bold and the Beautiful that same year, played by Diamont. He departed in 1996, and returned after two years on July 28, 1998. Ten years later in December 2008, news broke that Diamont had been let go from The Young and the Restless. Fellow cast member Eric Braeden, who portrays Victor Newman, spoke out on Diamont's firing, saying: Diamont shot his final scenes for the series in January 2009, and his final airdate was on February 5 when he drowned after falling in a frozen lake. Shortly after, it was announced that Diamont had been hired on The Bold and the Beautiful. He was to portray Bill Spencer Jr., created specifically for him by head writer Bradley Bell. \\"It's funny how one door closes and another opens,\\" Diamont said. \\"I had a lot of emotion tied to Y&R.; My entire adult life had been there, including so many relationships. Little did I know that such a great character and work situation was literally around the corner.\\" Diamont briefly reprised the role eight months after the character's death as a hallucination by his daughter, Colleen. Storylines =1985‚Äì2005= Brad Carlton was first introduced as the Abbotts' gardener, who caught the eye of the youngest Abbott daughter, Traci. The two were married twice, with the second marriage producing a daughter, Colleen Carlton. During his second marriage to Traci, Brad was held captive in a cage by his unstable first ex-wife, Lisa Mansfield. After he divorced Traci, Brad was tricked into marrying the wealthy widow, Cassandra Rawlins, after a ski trip to Aspen. Brad eventually returned to Genoa City with plans to divorce Cassandra, but en route to finalize her divorce plans, Cassandra was hit by a truck and killed. Brad inherited her fortune and her estate. Throughout his on-and-off relationship with Traci, he had feelings for her sister, Ashley Abbott. They eventually married, and he adopted her daughter who was given his last name, Abby Carlton. Ashley was pregnant with Brad's child, but she lost the baby in a car accident. They split up, and he later married Victoria Newman in November 2006. Known as a \\"playboy,\\" Brad has also had flings with Lauren Fenmore, Jill Abbott, Diane Jenkins and Olivia Winters. He was also briefly engaged to Nikki Newman. In one 1994 storyline, Brad had a heart attack during a passionate night with Lauren. The consummate opportunist, Brad rose to prominence in Genoa City's business world somewhat quickly, with his marriage to Traci Abbott and relationship with the Abbott family giving him his start. He stepped on a lot of toes over the years, particularly Victor Newman and his one-time brother-in-law, Jack Abbott. Brad's anger boiled over in 2005 when Jack refused to instate him as CEO of Jabot. Brad stormed out of the office, and he soon took a job at Newman Enterprises to spite Jack. =2006‚Äì2009= In 2006, Brad married Victor's daughter, Victoria, much to her father's dismay. For the duration of their marriage, Brad continued to fight his feelings for Victoria's one-time sister-in-law, Sharon Newman. During this time, he also had an affair with Sharon. Upon Victor's initiation of a background check on Brad, it was discovered in a retconned storyline after almost 20 years of being on the show that Brad was not who he had initially claimed to be. Brad's real name was George Kaplan, and he assumed the identity of a friend who died in an accident in order to hide from the people who had killed his family. A 2006 story arc involved Brad's past catching up with him, as his mother, Rebecca Kaplan, had to help find an artifact that was stolen from its rightful owners by the Nazis who had put Rebecca to work in a concentration camp cataloging stolen art. Rebecca had been forced to do this because she was Jewish. Victoria became pregnant with Brad's child, but she, too, miscarried shortly thereafter. Brad and Victoria subsequently divorced. Victoria discovered that she was pregnant again, but the father turned out to be J.T. Hellstrom, to whom she was now married. After the collapse of Clear Springs, Victoria got struck by falling debris, and she was in a coma for months. After waking up, Brad let the cat out of the bag about Victor firing Nick from Newman Enterprises. After the divorce, Brad still tried to be with Sharon, several times, but he failed. Frustrated and angered at his inability to advance at Newman Enterprises, Brad joined Jabot Cosmetics in May 2008 as Chief Operating Officer. At Jabot, Brad became somewhat of a confidant‚Äìspy for Chancellor Industries CEO, Jill Abbott. Brad also had a somewhat difficult relationship with David Chow, the co-CEO of Jabot. Because of his dislike for Chow, who admitted to a problem with compulsive gambling, Brad repeatedly invited David to card games, lent him large sums of money to pay off gambling debts and gave him tips on horse races in a successful effort to take advantage of David's gambling addiction and to gain leverage over him. Following the death of his wife Sabrina Costelana Newman, Victor disappeared to Mexico only to be declared dead by Mexican authorities after an apparent boating accident. As stipulated in Victor's new will, the lion's share of his estate was bequeathed to his son, Adam Newman, who was going by his birth name of Victor Adam Newman Jr. Adam embarked on radical changes within the company, assuming the position of Chairman of the Board and installing Brad as CEO of Newman Enterprises and right-hand man in \\"expanding Newman globally\\" . Adam fired long-time Newman employees Neil Winters and Victoria Newman, while making an enemy of the executor of the Newman estate, Michael Baldwin. Having schemed, back-stabbed and betrayed to get ahead, it appeared that Brad had finally achieved the executive position that he had coveted for so long. Shortly after being hired by Adam to be CEO of Newman Enterprises, Victor returned and fired his son. Victor also reinstated Neil Winters as CEO. Later that week, Neil asked Brad to step down as CEO of Newman saying that if he did not, then he would sue Brad for hacking into Newman Enterprises personal files and taking them to Jabot Cosmetics. Brad agreed, and he stepped down as CEO. When Sharon's marriage started to crumble again, Brad got another chance to approach her, especially after Phyllis had called him and tried to convince him to seduce Sharon so that she would stay away from Nick. Brad eventually revealed to Sharon that Phyllis sent him after her, and Sharon was not able to forgive Brad. He followed Sharon to Jack's cabin, where he apologized and explained how much he still loved her, but she was not able to return his feelings. He left the cabin, and on the road home, he found Noah Newman drowning in a lake after falling through the ice. He managed to pull Noah out of the water and back onto the ice, but tragically fell in himself and was swept under the frozen lake by the current. He drowned and his dead body, frozen in the ice, was discovered later. His last appearance was several months later when he appeared to his daughter, Colleen, as she herself was drowning in the same lake while trying to escape the clutches of the demented Patty Williams.

February 24, 2007 \\"Bid on Dreamgirls Costumes for Charity\\" History of collecting In the early days, most people sought autographs or original photographs or posters. Collectors had to rely on a handful of news magazines that were full of various sellers offering mail order catalogues or asking to buy bulk lots, or particular items of interest. Occasionally, events would be organized which were structured around a live auction -- these, while fewer in number today, still occur, and one can still buy memorabilia in person from trusted sellers on-site. The community was also fairly fragmented, with collectors and dealers spread out across the globe and no real consistent and reliable way to communicate with one another. Movie studios were slow to recognize the value of their property, \\"generally viewing the material as junk taking up precious backlot real estate.\\" Often, workers would just take souvenirs or sell items without permission, aware that their employers did not particularly care. One of the more notorious of these was costumer Kent Warner, who amassed a large private collection and made money selling to interested buyers. One of his friends claimed that Warner rescued Humphrey Bogart's Casablanca trench coat, which had been slated for burning. The turning point came in 1970. Kirk Kerkorian had bought MGM the year before and installed James Thomas Aubrey, Jr. as president. As part of his cost-cutting measures, Aubrey decided to auction off hundreds of thousands of items. The success of this mammoth event made people take notice. =1970 MGM auction= MGM sold the contents of seven sound stages \\"for a mere $1.5 million\\" to auctioneer David Weisz. There were over 350,000 costumes alone. Weisz hired Kent Warner to help catalog and prepare for the auction. In the course of his work, Warner found several pairs of the ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz (it is common practice to make multiple copies of important props). One pair became the centerpiece of the event and sold for a then-unheard-of $15,000 (Warner kept or sold an unknown number of other pairs). Actress Debbie Reynolds spent $180,000 and \\"purchased thousands of items\\", the beginning of her large collection.

Among the items to be put up for bid in the first of these auctions are: *Marilyn Monroe's \\"subway dress\\", whose skirt is raised by the updraft of a passing subway train in The Seven Year Itch. *one of Charlie Chaplin's trademark bowler hats *an early, unused Arabian motif version of the ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz *Audrey Hepburn's Ascot dress and hat from My Fair Lady *Charlton Heston's tunic, robe, and accessories from Ben-Hur On June 18, 2011, the subway dress sold for $4.6 million, far in excess of pre-auction estimates of $1‚Äì2 million. Another Monroe dress, worn in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, fetched $1.2 million; it had been expected to go for $200,000 to $300,000. Estimated at $60,000 to $80,000, a blue cotton dress Judy Garland used in test shots for The Wizard of Oz went for $910,000. In total, the auction grossed $22.8 million. In the second Reynolds auction, on December 3, 2011, a still-functioning Panavision PSR 35mm camera used to film Star Wars went for $625,000, breaking records for Star Wars memorabilia and vintage cameras. Influence of the internet In the early days of the internet, the larger community began to get in touch with one another through UseNet newsgroups (for example, alt.binaries.pictures.movie-posters). As the internet grew, collectors began communicating in ways never thought possible. In 1995, popular on-line email group MoPo was formed, creating a central place for people to keep in touch about things and events important to the community. This group continues to provide information to new and old collectors alike. By 1997, the community had changed forever; eBay was quickly becoming the alternative marketplace after two years of steady growth. Professional sellers took notice, causing many of them to close their bricks-and-mortar businesses and focus their attention completely on internet sites and the future of the on-line marketplace. In the early days of internet selling, prices varied widely. One could find posters normally valued in the hundreds of dollars selling for twenty dollars, or, alternatively, find posters normally valued at twenty dollars going for a hundred, or more. Today, the market place for film memorabilia has mostly stabilised. While one can still see a rare film poster go for large amounts, it is far more common to find that items are priced either at or near market value, or are bid up to that point. Types *Film posters *Lobby cards *Still photos *Autographs *Film props *Costumes *Pressbooks and presskits *Programmes *Heralds *Glass slides *Industry magazines and related material *Scripts, storyboards, and original concept art *Promotional material of any kind *Commercial collectibles Notable examples *Several pairs of the ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz are known to exist. One pair is on permanent display at the National Museum of American History, several others are in the hands of private collectors, and one pair was stolen in 2005. The last auction price, in 2000, was $666,000. Also, the black hat belonging to the Wicked Witch of the West sold for $33,000 in 1988 and $197,400 in 2008. *There were several statuettes made for the 1941 The Maltese Falcon ‚Äî two lead figures weighing each, and a seven-pound (3.2 kg), more finely crafted, resin model ‚Äî all handled by Humphrey Bogart. Christie's auctioned one of the lead figures, part of the estate of actor William Conrad, on December 6, 1994; it was purchased for $398,500 by Ronald Winston, president of Harry Winston, Inc. Within two years, Winston had resold the prop \\"at an enormous profit\\" ‚Äî for as much as $1 million ‚Äî to an unknown European collector. On November 25, 2013, Bonhams, in association with TCM, sold the other lead figure, the only one confirmed to have appeared in the movie, for over $4 million, including the buyers fee.

It is now located in the Tainan Airport. It is the only surviving member of the Pacific Corporation, but currently it is owned by Taiwan Aerospace Corporation and is no longer related to the Central Intelligence Agency. History Air Asia was created out of Civil Air Transport (CAT) in 1955 as Air America's aircraft service unit. In 1949, CAT, in order to prepare for the ROC government's evacuation from the mainland, bought two ships to house all aircraft maintenance equipment and parts to evacuate to Taiwan. From 1949 to 1962, these two ships were docked in Kaohsiung, and the aircraft to be serviced had to land at Tainan Airport, its parts of concern dismounted, transferred to the two ships for repair, and then brought back to the airport to remount it on the aircraft. It was only until 1962 when its current location was opened and aircraft can be serviced directly at the airport. Despite such inconvenience, its relationship with the United States has made it the largest air service center in the east Asia, servicing all United States Air Force aircraft deployed in East Asia, and all covert operation aircraft from Pacific Corporation companies. It has serviced more than 12,000 USAF aircraft and retrofitted 8,000 aircraft engines during this period. During the Vietnam War, the US Navy also utilized Air Asia's services for maintaining their fleet of C-118B aircraft deployed in support of US Navy Seal and Seabee Teams. At the peak of its existence, it operated another service facility at Tachikawa, Japan. In February 1975, it was sold to E-Systems, and in 1987 transferred to Precision Airmotive. Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) acquired Air Asia in 1994. Capabilities 1\\\\.

The \\"apron\\" designation was apparently gained from the tendency of early European descriptions to misidentify the pair of labia as a single, wide organ, which they called, in French, a tablier, or \\"apron\\". This trait was first noted as far back as the 17th century, but became extensively documented in the last part of the 18th and the 19th century. It was Sarah Baartman's 19th century case that brought the elongated labia back out for discussion. For many years, the identification of Baartman was questioned because she demonstrated this feature. In the Gender and Science Reader, elongated labia minora were said to be portrayed by a \\"Negro.\\" So it is because of this trait that Baartman was considered to be part of the so-called \\"inferior race\\". Labia may also be shaped by intentional labia stretching, usually done by an older aunt on girls beginning at the age of five, a practice that formerly fell into the category of Type IV female genital mutilation. In 2008, The World Health Organisation reclassified the practice as a body modification due to a perceived lack of harm and a reported much more positive perception of women's sexuality by those who practice it.health and beauty: vaginal practices: Indonesia (Yogyakarta), Mozambique (Tete), South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal), and Thailand (Chonburi) File:inverted.apron.jpgcloseup of enlarged labia, spread File:khoisan.apron.jpgKhoikhoi women with pendulous labia visible See also *Labia stretching *Saartjie \\"Sarah\\" Baartman *Steatopygia References Mammal female reproductive system Gynaecology Pelvis ","title":"Elongated labia"},{"id":"5711508","text":"Calangute is a town in North Goa, famous for its beach.

It is situated just south of Calangute Beach, and is a tourist destination. It is less congested and has better planned than the other beaches of Goa.  History  During the late 16th century, Candolim became the first village to be entirely converted to Christianity in Bardez by the Franciscans. The present Christian identity of its villagers dates back to the conversion of Santu Sinay (Shenoy), a ganvkar (Konkani: freeholder) who belonged to the nobility of his people. Santu Sinay (1577‚Äì1640), was the son of Naru Sinay; who had earlier migrated from Loutolim, Salcette, and established himself in Candolim, where he purchased the fifth vangodd (clan) of the comunidade on 13 August 1604. Naru Sinay died after 1624, and was survived by his wife, and three sons‚ÄîJeronimo de Souza, Santu Sinay, and Christov√£o d'Andrade. Santu Sinay was converted along with the rest of his family at the age of 8, and subsequently took the name of Salvador Pinto. His godfather was Fr. Manoel Pinto, a Franciscan rector of the Church of Our Lady of Hope of Candolim and the seminary of Reis Magos. He was brought up in the seminary of Reis Magos, where he developed a great devotion to St. Francis Xavier. Salvador Pinto was tutored by two Franciscan priests, Fr. Pinto and Fr. Sim√£o de Nazareth; who succeeded the former as rector of Candolim parish. Salvador Pinto worked zealously to spread Christianity in the village. Fr. de Nazareth held great influence with the Viceroys and in recognition of Salvador Pinto's tremendous work in converting the village, obtained for him many life grants and concessions which are still held by his descendants. Fr. de Nazareth, as representative of Fr. Miguel de S. Bonaventura‚ÄîCustodian and General Commissioner of East Indies and Diogo Dias, syndic of St. Francis and procurator of His Holiness‚Äîgranted two perpetual graves in the Candolim Church, to Salvador Pinto and his father-in-law Ant√≥nio Pereira in the transept, in front of the altar of Bom Jesus, and also to his wife and mother- in-law, Maria and Catharina Pereira in the transept; her grave located between those of two parishioners, Pedro Sequeira and Francisco de Souza. Candolim was the focal point of the anti-Portuguese revolt of 1787, also called the \\"Conspiracy of the Pintos\\", because it was spearheaded by priests belonging to the village's Pinto (Shenoy) clan. This revolt occurred due to the continued discrimination of the natives related to positions in clergy and government. This angered the Pinto family who were among the protectors of the Portuguese in Goa and had been awarded a coat of arms in 1770. Demographics India census,http://www.census2011.co.in/data/town/626697-candolim-goa.html Candolim had a population of 8500. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Candolim has an average literacy rate of 76%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; with male literacy of 81% and female literacy of 70%. 9% of the population is under 6 years of age. Candolim Beach A normal day in Candolim Beach, Goa Candolim lies 15 kilometres from Panjim, the Goan capital, in northern Goa. Beginning at Fort Aguada and merging with Calangute Beach towards the end, it is one of the longest beaches in the state. The beach in itself is very calm, at times tourists come here from Rajneesh Ashram in Pune to take a break. A panoramic view of sunset at Candolim Beach in 2018. The main Candolim-Calangute Road is packed with shops and restaurants, but the beach front is free of any commercial activity apart from some water activities. The area around the beach can be termed as resort free as there aren't any resorts there. However, the beach has quite a number of inns. A feature about the Candolim Beach was the ship River Princess, which had been stuck at the shores of the beach since 2000 but has since been removed.  Aguada Fort  The fort was built by the Portuguese way back in 1612 for defense against the Dutch and the Maratha invaders. Along with the fort the church, lighthouse and the barracks of the Aguada Jail have become tourist attractions. Citations References .

Politics Chabua is a Legislative Assembly constituency and a Circle of Dibrugarh District. Chabua is part of Lakhimpur. History In the early 1820s, the British East India Company began large-scale production of tea in Assam, India, of a tea variety traditionally brewed by the Singpho tribe. In 1826, the British East India Company took over the region from the Ahom kings through the Yandaboo Treaty. In 1837, the first English tea garden was established at Chabua in Upper Assam; in 1840, the Assam Tea Company began the commercial production of tea in the region, run by indentured servitude of the local inhabitants. Beginning in the 1850s, the tea industry rapidly expanded, consuming vast tracts of land for tea plantations. By the turn of the century, Assam became the leading tea-producing region in the world. The word Chabua consist of two words: chah which means \\"tea\\" and bua which means plantation. Later on, Chahbua became Chabua and the place got its name. During World War II, Chabua Air Force Station was constructed on the outskirts of the town. Chabua airfield was one of the largest bases used by the USAAF Air Transport Command to ferry supplies and personnel across The Hump to China in World War II. Chabua was headquarters for both the Assam and Bengal Wings of the India- China Division, ATC; and the operating base for the flying squadron of the 1333rd AAF Base Unit. The country's eastern sector bordering China got fortified on 8 March 2011, with the induction of the Sukhoi Su-30MKI fighter aircraft at the Chabua Air Force Station. The initiation was done through a symbolic ceremony with the inaugural flight of the Sukhoi Su-30MKI taking off from here. It also performed an overshoot before landing. Chabua is the second airbase in the northeast after Tezpur to house the Sukhois, capable of striking targets inside China with a cruising speed range of 3,200 km, which can be more than doubled with mid-air refuelling by IL-78 aircraft.

Early life Born in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, Wise moved to the Bronx, New York, where his parents resided with his two older brothers Juan & Jose. At the age of 4, his family moved to East New York, Brooklyn, New York. Hip hop career Daddy O and MC Delite were the founding members of the group Stetsasonic, then known as the Stetson Brothers, in 1981. Joining the group in 1983, the group had another level of creativity and talent with the presence of the PRINCE OF SOUND himself, who is also known in the group by the moniker the Stetsa-Human Mix Machine provided beatboxing and other human percussion. Also, what many didn't know was that he was the very first Latino human beat box to hit the hip hop scene. Wise debuted his Human Turntable technique of beatboxing on the band's first single called \\"Just Say Stet\\" b/w \\"Rock de la Stet,\\" which was released in 1985. There was also another single from the album in which Wise and Daddy-O collaborated. While Daddy-O performs the vocals, Wise gives his version of \\"Impeach the President,\\" which happens to be the very first time that a human beatbox was heard adding a song-like rhythm to the beat that was coming out of his mouth on the song \\"Faye\\" which was on the group's first album, On Fire (1986). With Stetsasonic, Wise toured the world with rap acts like Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Whodini, Eric B. & Rakim, EPMD and Public Enemy. In 1989, Wise (with fellow Stetsasonic members Delite, Daddy-O and Frukwan) participated in KRS-One's Stop the Violence Movement, an assembly of hip hop artists including Kool Moe Dee, Heavy D, MC Lyte, Public Enemy, and Doug E. Fresh. This artistic collaboration yielded the posse cut \\"Self Destruction\\", a protest song decrying black-on-black violence and media stigmatisation of all hip hop as violent. Unusually, Wise was featured not as a human percussionist, but as a vocalist, sharing his verse with Daddy-O. Released in 1989, the single reached #75 in the US Top 40. Wise has also participated in a few commercials in which he lends his beatbox sounds. One was for Campbell's Soup in which a cartoon of a B-boy bear kicks a ferocious beat. This commercial was aired amidst Saturday morning cartoons. Wise was also featured in a documentary on the art of the human beatbox, Breath Control: The History of the Human Beat Box, which was shown at the Tribeca Film Festival and also featured fellow human percussionists such as Doug E. Fresh, Biz Markie, Ready Rock C and Emanon.

Abode of Justice) is a neighborhood located in southwestern Tel Aviv, Israel. It was the first Jewish neighborhood to be built outside the old city of the ancient port of Jaffa. Originally a Mizrahi Jewish and Yemenite Jewish neighbourhood, for years, the neighborhood prospered as Tel Aviv, the first modern Hebrew city, grew up around it. Years of neglect and disrepair followed, but since the early 1980s, Neve Tzedek has become one of Tel Aviv's latest fashionable and expensive districts, with a village-like atmosphere. Name Literally, Neve Tzedek means Abode of Justice, but it is also one of the names for God (). History Neve Tzedek with the Nehoshtan tower in the center Neve Tzedek has a variety of architectural styles, here: Bauhaus and eclectic Neve Tzedek was established in 1887, 22 years before the 1909 founding of Tel Aviv, by a group of Mizrahi Jewish families seeking to move outside of over-crowded Jaffa. Soon, additional small developments grew up around Neve Tzedek and were incorporated into the contemporary boundaries of the neighbourhood. The residents preferred to construct the new quarter with low-rise buildings along narrow streets. These homes frequently incorporated design elements from the Jugendstil/Art Nouveau and later Bauhaus art movements and featured contemporary luxuries such as private bathrooms. At the beginning of the 1900s, some artists and writers made Neve Tzedek their residence. Most notably, future Nobel prize laureate Shmuel Yosef Agnon, as well as Hebrew artist Nachum Gutman, used Neve Tzedek as both a home and a sanctuary for art. Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook was the first Rabbi of Neve Tzedek; he even maintained a Yeshiva there. During his time in Neve Tzedek he became very close friends with many of the writers, especially Agnon. However, as Tel Aviv began to develop away from the Jaffa core, the more affluent people started to move out from the southern end of the city to inhabit the newly-developing northern areas. With its buildings abandoned, neglected and subjected to the unsightly corrosive effects of the shore atmosphere upon concrete and stucco, Neve Tzedek degenerated into disrepair and urban decay. As with the rest of South Tel Aviv, after 1948, it became a predominantly Mizrahi area. By the 1960s, city officials deemed the neighbourhood ‚Äì by this time almost a slum ‚Äì incompatible with the modern image of a busy, bustling city. However, plans to demolish the historic neighbourhood to make way for high rise apartments were eventually cancelled as many Neve Tzedek buildings were placed on preservation lists. At the same time, the old, worn-out neighbourhood was also becoming appreciated as an oasis of the semi-pastoral and picturesque amidst the modernist development of the city center. By the end of the 1980s, efforts began to renovate and preserve Neve Tzedek's century-old structures. New establishments were housed in old buildings, most notably the Suzanne Dellal Centre for Dance and Theatre and the Nachum Gutman Museum, located in the artist's home. This gentrification led to Neve Tzedek's rebirth as a fashionable and popular upmarket residence for Tel Avivians. Its main streets became lined once again with artists' studios, including the ceramics studio of Samy D., alongside trendy caf√©s and bars, and more recently boutique hotels and shops selling hand-made goods to wealthy Israelis and tourists. The Tel Aviv Light Rail, which is expected to pass near Neve Tzedek, will make the neighbourhood even more accessible for visitors and residents alike. Education The (), a French international school, is in Neve Tzedek.\\"Contacts.\\" Coll√®ge Fran√ßais Marc Chagall de Tel-Aviv. Retrieved on 22 January 2015. \\"Sur Place ou Par Courrier : 24 Rehov Chelouch ( ou Shlush), Neve Tzedek Tel-Aviv, Isra√´l\\" Controversial plans Nehoshtan Tower, a controversial project carried out as part of the overall plan In 2009, the Tel Aviv municipality began to approve plans to construct a number of new highways and widened arterial roads throughout southern Tel Aviv, including the proposed railway road, which would partially encircle Neve Tzedek. As part of these plans, the municipality approved the construction of a large number of skyscrapers in and around Neve Tzedek. A number of parking lots would also be constructed along Rothschild Boulevard in order to handle the parking demand induced by the new road space. Opponents of this plan cited a number of concerns with the approval process and with the plan itself. First and foremost, they argue that the addition of new skyscraper-lined highways will dramatically alter the historical and social character of Neve Tzedek and its surrounding areas in southern Tel Aviv. Furthermore, many residents and environmentalists are concerned about the effects of large amounts of traffic being funneled through the area, especially in a time when other developed cities are removing highways, which are now seen as mistakes from the past. Beyond the concerns with the project itself, opponents believe that the discussions have been conducted outside of the public view and with developers' interests being put before those of the community.

Senseless violence or zinloos geweld (Dutch) is a term frequently used by among others the media, politicians and NGOs to define the nature of several shocking events in Belgium and the Netherlands in recent years. The use of the term is politically charged and may not reflect any unique elements of any particular crime given that label. The term expresses the perceived senselessness of the occurred acts of violence; the perpetrator and the victim do not know each other, the violence seems not to be motivated by greed or other common factors. The violence occurs suddenly and often under the influence of alcohol. Origin of the term The term \\"senseless violence\\", in the meaning used in this article, was first used in 1997 by Cees Bangma, district chief of the Dutch police unit Midden-Friesland. Before 1997 the term did not carry the same moral connotation in Belgian and Dutch culture, and typically referred to overseas warzone violence. Bangma used it in a letter written to the Leeuwarder Courant, a Frisian newspaper in which he made an appeal to the Dutch population to have a minute of silence for Meindert Tjoelker, who was killed on 13 September 1997. This minute was necessary \\"to make it clear to everyone that the Frisian society does not accept senseless violence\\". A wave of reactions followed, which also included media hype. As a consequence, much more attention was spent to every similar case of violence, which led to the perception that violence was on the increase. A political group Landelijke Stichting Tegen Zinloos Geweld (national foundation against senseless violence) was created and people created the lady bug tile as a memorial or reminder against senseless violence. The group send guest teachers to schools and sport associations, but became rather inactive since ca. 2009. Criticism The term is often criticized. Some people think that violence is never legitimate and consider the term to be a tautology. Others say that the term has never been clearly defined and does not help to understand a particular phenomenon. Others point out that the term is or can be misused by politicians who strive for more repressive measures against crimes. In 2016, the national newspaper NRC reported about a recent case of youngsters mistreating a homeless person. The newspaper quoted a spokesperson of the police who said that hardly any violence happens out of the blue. Criminologists have started to use the term uitgaansgeweld instead, violence occurring going out in the evening to pubs and bars. Because of the local approach there are no recent national figures about the phenomenon, according to an expert. Belgium While there have been multiple isolated cases of fatal senseless violence in the decade since 1997, the number of deadly incidents surged since April in 2006. The following is a non-exhaustive list of deadly incidents since 1998: * November 28, 1998: Patrick Mombaerts (died in Brussels after being beaten by very young robbers, who were sentenced to community service only). * March 25, 1999: Christel De Jonghe (killed by a never uncovered immigrant during a robbery in Antwerp). * April 2002: unidentified woman (died of a heart attack after being chased and attacked by youths in Brussels). * May 7, 2002: Ahmed Isnasni and Habiba El Hajji (shot to death in Brussels by their neighbour Hendrik Vyt, who then killed himself). * October 2002: unidentified elderly woman (died from wounds suffered in a street robbery in Brussels). * November 26, 2002: Mohammed Achrak (shot to death in Antwerp by his neighbour; murder led to citywide riots). * December 19, 2003: Glenn Wijnants (stabbed to death in Antwerp by a man for no apparent reason). * April 12, 2006: Joe Van Holsbeeck (stabbed to death by two young during a daytime robbery in Brussels). * May 11, 2006: Oulemata Niangadou and Luna Drowart (shot and killed by Hans Van Themsche during a homicidal rampage in Antwerp). * June 24, 2006: Guido Demoor (train-driver who died after a hit against his head on an Antwerp bus by six youths he had asked to calm down). * July 2, 2006: Philibert Mees (stabbed to death in his Mechelen house by his neighbour). * October 21, 2006: Eddy Sabbe (beaten to death during a robbery by immigrants). * November 3, 2006: Mohamed Benzil (killed after being pushed in front of an Antwerp tram by immigrants, possibly in a case of road rage). * February 3, 2007: Bart Bonroy (18-year-old stabbed to death in Ostend by Kenny B. after he refused to give a cigarette). * February 20, 2007: Yannick Amba- Bongelo (17-year-old Congolese who was stabbed to death by a gang of 30 youths during Mardi Gras in Binche). * September 1, 2007: yet unnamed elderly man (stabbed to death in broad daylight in a busy street in Brussels by a 28-year- old man). * December 4, 2007: Kitty Van Nieuwenhuyse (23-year-old police officer shot to death in her patrol car when responding to a burglary). * April, 2012: An MIVB employee died after being struck by a man, leading to a multiple-day-long strike by the Brussels transport services.

It became a civilian police organisation in 1992, a status it retained until 1 January 2001, when it was, together with the other existing police forces in Belgium, abolished and replaced by the Federal Police and the Local Police. History =Etymology= The word gendarme comes from Old French gens d'armes, meaning men-at-arms, whereas the Dutch name, rijkswacht, means guard of the realm. =Pre-independence= In 1795, the Belgian provinces came under French rule. It was at this time that the Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie was created. This military force had been created a short time before in France itself to replace the Marechaussee (mounted corps of marshals) of the former monarchy. The legislation which organised the new gendarmerie service in Belgium was a law dated April 17, 1798, which remained in force until 1957. In 1815, the Belgian provinces became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, ruled by King William I. The Dutch renamed the Gendarmerie the \\"Royal Marechaussee\\" and reorganised the force. =Belgium= In 1830 the Belgian Revolution occurred. After obtaining its independence, the new Belgian state created its own national Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie on the basis of the already existing constabulary. The Rijkswachters/Gendarmes operated throughout the country. From its creation, the Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie was formally part of the Belgian Army. The major strikes and tense social conditions of the 1930s brought important changes in the organization of the Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie, in particular through the expansion of the mobile units created in 1913. During the Second World War, the Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie was restricted to the role of administrative and legal police force, primarily concerned with road traffic. The majority of the Rijkswachters/Gendarmes refused to collaborate with the German occupiers. It is believed that individual gendarmes assisted the Belgian Resistance. These actions were not tolerated by the occupation authorities and from 1942 onwards the corps was deprived of many of its functions. After the war, the service was reorganized. New units were created, and at the end of 1957, new legislation relating to the fundamental role of the Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie was passed, envisaged in the Constitution of 1830. This law confirmed the functions of the Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie and its independence from the administrative authorities. The Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie was separated from the Belgian Army Territorial Defense Force, and became a fourth department within the military. The Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie was also authorised to create its own training establishments. During the 1960s conditions of service improved considerably. This period also saw a major increase in serious crimes (holdups, drug violations, terrorism, etc.). The Central Bureau of Investigations (CBO - Centraal Bureau voor Opsporingen (Dutch), BCR - Bureau Central des Recherches) was created, as well as a centralized radio network. Tracker dogs were employed for the first time. During the 1980s, the Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie suffered serious problems. Much of its equipment was outdated, it was significantly understrength, and there were serious financial issues. It was also the period of fighting communist cells (CCC), serious and deadly criminal activities by gangs (like the Nijvel gang, a case that was never solved) and hooliganism (Heysel Stadium disaster). Several parliamentary commissions blamed the Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie for poor investigations and law enforcement work in these cases. The Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie was threatened with disbandment, and drastic measures were taken to reorganise several units and to improve public relations. Old Gendarmerie station in Gistel. =Demilitarisation= On 1 January 1992, the Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie lost its formal military status, resulting in major changes in policies, procedures, and staff regulation. Demilitarisation allowed the force to concentrate all its resources on civilian police work. Its military functions, as well as the supervision of the Ministry of Defence, were removed. This restructuring occurred after the 'black' 1980s of the Nijvel gang, Heysel Stadium disaster, Cellules Communistes Combattantes (CCC), and other criminal and terrorist activity, against which the Gendarmerie was deemed ineffective. Helicopter McDonnell Douglas MD-900 of the Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie =Disbandment= At the end of the 1990s, following adverse reports arising from the Dutroux Affair, the Belgian government decided to dissolve the existing police forces. The parliamentary commission, which investigated the errors that were made during the search for the missing children, stated that the three police organisations did not work effectively and efficiently together. There were problems with cooperation and vital information was not exchanged. Parliament, both the majority and the opposition, decided to abolish the existing structures, and created a new police organisation, structured in two departments: the Federal Police and the Local Police. In 2001, the Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie was dissolved.

In simplified form, this was retained as full dress wear until the late 1960s. It was thereafter replaced by a more modern uniform comprising a dark blue peaked cap with red piping, dark blue coat with open collar and red Gendarmerie insignia, a light blue shirt with tie, dark blue trousers with red piping (a single stripe on the side of the leg) and the distinctive shoulder rank insignia.

The museum includes two of the buildings first used by legislators to meet in Wisconsin Territory. Currently owned and operated by the Wisconsin Historical Society, the site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Background From 1818 to 1836, the land that is now Wisconsin was part of Michigan Territory. In 1836, Michigan itself achieved statehood and Congress created Wisconsin Territory from the frontier lands to the west. That territory was larger than you might guess, including the lands that are now Minnesota, Iowa, and the eastern Dakotas. At that time, this vast area was sparsely settled, with a total population of about 22,000. With one In 1836, Milwaukee had under 2,000 people. Madison was only wooded hills and swamps between the four lakes, which had just been bought by James Doty and some other real estate speculators with an eye toward founding a city there. Territorial capital 300px Early leaders in the territory needed a place to meet and establish the territorial government. Several land speculators saw this need even before the territory was official, and tried to prepare sites which could be chosen as the territorial capital, hoping to become wealthy if the capitol was built in their city. One such speculator was John Atchison, a general merchandise businessman from Galena. In 1835 he laid out the village of Belmont, Wisconsin and in 1836 began building four public buildings there to attract the lawmakers to his site: a council house where lawmakers could convene, a lodging house for the legislators, a house for the territorial governor, and a courthouse for the territorial supreme court. These wooden buildings were constructed outside of Wisconsin (possibly Pittsburg) and shipped to Belmont for final assembly. On September 9, 1836, territorial Governor Henry Dodge announced that Belmont would be used as the territorial capital, at least for the first legislative session, making Atchison's council house the first capitol. The likely reason for Dodge's selection of Belmont as capital city was its location in Wisconsin's lead mining region, which at that time was the territory's most populous area. However, the selection was controversial, and some contend that Dodge had other motives for the selection based upon his earlier associations with Atchison. The first session of Wisconsin's territorial legislature began at Belmont on October 25, 1836. Soon after the session convened, Governor Dodge gave a speech outlining the purpose of the session: to establish a system of government for the territory and make a final selection for the territorial capitol. Perhaps because of the controversy over his choice of Belmont, Dodge announced that he would approve any site the legislature voted to become the permanent capital, even though he had the legal power to veto all territorial legislation. That announcement re- opened the scramble for locating the territorial capital. Most lawmakers were opposed to the idea of continuing to use the capitol at Belmont, since the lodging house was small and overcrowded, and none of the buildings had heat or water. Burlington, Cassville, Fond du Lac and Madison had their advocates, among others. The boosters of Dubuque even invited the whole legislature over for a weekend visit. But Doty was there, too, lobbying for his proposed Madison City. Supposedly he even sent a wagon to Dubuque to bring back buffalo robes, which he then doled out to sway the freezing legislators. After much wrangling, both houses of the legislature approved moving the capital to Burlington for a year, then permanently to the site advocated by James Doty, on the isthmus at his \\"Madison City,\\" just as soon as buildings could be erected. When legislators were not debating the future site of the capital, they set the groundwork for the territorial government. In all, 42 acts were approved by the legislature before it adjourned on December 9, 1836. These acts organized Wisconsin government, created a judicial system, and established several new counties in the territory. The legislature would not meet again in Belmont, preferring to meet at a temporary location in Burlington until the new capitol at Madison was completed. Later, in 1838, Burlington became a part of Iowa Territory, forcing the legislature to move to Madison earlier than anticipated. Later use As the isthmus between Lake Mendota and Lake Monona developed into the city of Madison, the village of Belmont slowly faded. Many of the settlers who had rushed to Belmont when it became territorial capital were now leaving for Madison. Still, the village survived, although the route taken by the Mineral Point Railroad prompted most of its residents to relocate three miles to the southeast of the original town in 1867, meaning that the first capitol is now three miles northwest of Belmont. 1903 illustration of Capitol Building After the territorial officials left, the capitol building and accompanying structures were used as private residences and later livestock barns. Souvenir hunters scavenged relics from the building. Then in 1910 the Wisconsin Federation of Women's Clubs initiated a restoration project, completing a restoration of the original council house in 1924. Later, the lodging house, which had been moved and used as the home of territorial Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles Dunn, was returned to its original site and underwent restoration in 1956. Together, these two structures created First Capitol Historic Site. The site was initially operated by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. In 1994, it was transferred to the Wisconsin Historical Society, which is now responsible for the museum's operations.

It was previously considered a subspecies of Holbrookia lacerata. Geographic range It is found in northern Mexico and the United States in southern Texas. Description The southern spot-tailed earless lizard is overall light grayish tan in color, with two paravertebral rows of transverse light-edged dark blotches, one row down either side of the back and a second lateral row of dark, pale-edged blotches that are usually not connected to the paravertebral blotches. Adults are in total length. They have round, dark spots on the ventral surface of the tail, a characteristic which gives them both their common and scientific names. As with all species and subspecies of earless lizard, they have no external ear openings. When gravid, females will often turn greenish yellow on neck and trunk. Behavior As with all earless lizards, the southern spot-tailed earless lizard is diurnal and insectivorous. Habitat Their preferred habitat is subhumid agricultural and nonagricultral flatlands and very low rolling hills with sparse vegetation such as small patches of grass on dark clay loam soils, with a few mesquite trees mesquite, but not prickly pear cactus.

While State Bank of India is the busiest of all, other banks like Bank Of India, Allahabad Bank, Axis Bank also have their presence here. =Industry= Champdani is in the heart of the jute mills area of Hooghly district and given below is a glimpse of how the jute mills in the area function. Northbrook Jute Mill at Champdani, which was closed on 15 June 2014, after murder of its CEO, H.K. Maheswari, in broad daylight, reopened on 1 July 2014. It employs about 4,000 workers. Northbrook Jute Co. was incorporated on 27 January 1908. Dalhousie Jute Mill at Champdani (PO Baidyabati) was closed on 1 June 2017. The mill employed around 5,000 workers and produced around 120 tonnes per day. The mill had been opened in 1905 and was upgrading ‚Äì replacing old machinery with modern ones requiring less manpower. The workers had been protesting against this and production had been suspended since 29 April 2017. In 2002, Suresh Kumar Prasad, the chief personnel manager, had been shot dead as a sequel to a labour dispute. Angus Jute Mill at Angus, Champdani, closed down on 28 October 2014 following a dispute regarding transfer of 15 workers from one department to another. The mill employed around 4,500 workers. Several years earlier, on 1 November 1983, the workers of the mill, owned by Kolkata's Thomas Duff and company, killed their manager, Amal Bose, for delay in payment of wages. Amongst the other well-known industrial units in Champdani are: Lagan Engineering is a jute machinery manufacturing company set up in 1955 in Angus in Champdani. The machinery it has manufactured has been functioning well in numerous jute mills. It has been modernising to keep abreast with the latest technological developments. It was initially set up by the Northern Ireland-based-James Mackie & Sons, run for a short period by the Government of India, which subsequently divested its shares to Murlidhar Ratanlal Exports Ltd. Shyama Industries jute machinery manufacturing and supplier of jute machinery manufacturer of jute machinery was established at Angus in 1991. Braithwaite‚Äôs Angus Works was set up at Champdani in 1960 for manufacturing cranes, foundry products and machinery components etc. In 2010, the administrative control of Braithwaite & Co. was taken over by the Ministry of Railways. The militancy that affects jute mill workers, does not seem to affect other industries, who also want to stay aloof from what is happening in the jute industry.

Ann continued her predecessors' efforts to keep peace with English colonists.A Study of Virginia Indians and Jamestown: The First Century Chapter four, by Martha W. McCartney for the National Park Service of the United States. She became the leader of her tribe after the death of her husband Totopotomoi in 1656, who was killed when he took troops to help English colonizers in Virginia when inland mountain tribes invaded in the mid-1650s. Ann's last record in history was in 1715, when she was noted as visiting the colonial authorities. She had come to seek fair treatment for her tribe, who suffered encroachment and raids by settlers.Frank E. Grizzard, D. Boyd Smith, Jamestown Colony, Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2007, p. 162, accessed 31 Jan 2009 The Pamunkey had, in spite of Totopotomoi's sacrifice, been treated poorly by the English settlers in the intervening years. Ann attempted to protect the survival of her people by petitioning to halt the sale of tribal land to outsiders, and halt the sale of liquor to members of the tribe. It has been suggested that Queen Ann and Queen Betty may have been the same person: Ann had a son, whom she sent to the Indian school at the College of William and Mary in 1711. He was sent as part of an agreement with the governor of Virginia: if her son and another Pamunkey child were sent to the Indian school, the tribe's debt would be forgiven. Ann's son's name is not known as many records were either not kept or were destroyed by war and time. Ann is believed to have died around 1723.

Due to the enormous success that the band had with Corazones, Jorge Gonz√°lez decided to follow that same musical line on his awaited solo debut. EMI-Odeon, who wanted this release to be a completely exportable product, launched a huge promotion campaign with the purpose of transforming it in Latin America's most important album of 1993.

The song, as well as its corresponding video-clip, were very successful in Chile and Latin America. In the same way, Mi Casa En El Arbol and Fe enjoyed some success too. Despite that sales of the album were not bad at all, they didn't fill the expectations of EMI-Odeon and Gonz√°lez. The following year, Gonz√°lez recorded El Futuro Se Fue, completely far from the glamour that prevailed on their debut. That album would be the last that he made on EMI-Odeon.

The role has been portrayed by actress Kate Linder since April 8, 1982. For over three decades, Esther has been known as the long-serving maid, housekeeper and confidant for businesswoman Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper).  Casting and character creation  Linder was initially hired to play a \\"one-day, one-line role\\". The actress remained on recurring until 1985, when she was upgraded to a full-time contract. In the beginning, the character remained unnamed. Jeanne Cooper, who plays Katherine, coined the name \\"Esther\\" when she began calling the character that \\"out of the blue\\". Linder said: \\"Then other people started calling me that and the writers picked up on it. That's how Esther was born.\\" A national contest was held to give Esther a surname, the options picked by the public were: \\"Valentine\\" and \\"Diamond\\", with Linder picking Valentine. Throughout her entire tenure on the soap opera, Linder has continued to work as a flight attendant for the United Airlines. Character development Linder has described the character of Esther as a \\"very loyal and very giving person\\", adding: \\"She gets run over and people take advantage of her.\\" Storylines Esther has served as Y&R;'s comic relief and has been Katherine Chancellor's (Jeanne Cooper) maid since 1982. She is also a trained alcohol abuse counselor. She had a one night stand with a plumber named \\"Tiny\\", with whom she had a daughter, Katherine Tina Valentine, who was only shown a handful of times as a child before emerging as Jabot Cosmetics fashionista, Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson). Esther was indirectly responsible for the death of Katherine's husband, Rex Sterling (Quinn Redeker) when she answered a personal ad and met Norman Peterson (Mark Haining), a notorious con man. In an effort to impress Norman, she posed as lady of the manor, and Rex and Katherine went along with it and disguised themselves as her servants. Norman coerced Esther into convincing Katherine to include her in her will and marry him. A suspicious Katherine and Rex arranged a fake wedding. Then, not content to wait for Katherine to die to inherit her riches, Rex caught Norman breaking into the estate safe. Rex was shot and killed in the altercation, leaving Katherine devastated. Norman was then arrested for murder and Esther has since been forgiven and named in Katherine's will. It was later revealed that Chloe Mitchell is her daughter. Esther then started attempting a normal relationship with her, but Chloe/Kate is frequently embarrassed by her mother's status as a maid and her lack of bashfulness regarding the chosen career. At Cane's yearning, they are getting somewhat close again. On November 20, 2008, at the reading of a presumed-dead Katherine's will, Esther inherited 1/10 of 1 percent of Katherine's 1 billion dollar estate (1 million dollars) as well as Katherine's half-ownership of the Chancellor Estate. Esther was now financially secure for life and can enjoy the life of luxury living in her newly owned mansion. At the same time, Esther went out on a date with Roger Wilkes (David Leisure), with whom she became engaged after only a few dates. Esther seems completely unaware of the fact that Roger is scamming her. Esther and Roger eventually married, but their marriage was declared invalid after it became clear that Roger was in fact a bigamist. It was soon discovered that Katherine was actually alive. Esther now takes great joy in being a grandmother to Chloe's daughter, Delia. In recent years, Esther has dealt with many losses. First Katherine died. She left Esther a generous salary with the stipulation that she continue keeping house at the Chancellor Mansion. Shortly thereafter, Delia was killed in a hit and run by Adam Newman. Esther ends up leaving her job at the Chancellor Mansion, unable to deal with Colin, who she claims was making passes at her, though this was never proven. She takes a job as a barista at Crimson Lights under owner Dylan McAvoy. Jill, realizing how much she misses Esther, hires her back, and she now works as the housekeeper at Chancellor Mansion once again. Reception Tommy Garrett of Canyon News praised Linder's portrayal of Esther when the character was grieving over the loss of Katherine Chancellor in 2008. Garrett wrote: \\"She‚Äôs bringing the show the much needed and deserved attention it‚Äôs been wanting for months with a role that continues getting better by the day.\\" He added that continually she \\"amazes\\" audiences and critics with her performance.

After 9 goals in 71 games, Buckle moved to local rivals Exeter City in October 1995, again on a free transfer. However, with Exeter suffering serious financial problems and almost going out of business, Buckle left in 1996 as, with the club in administration, they could not afford his wages. He played in a friendly for Cambridge United (away to Watford) on 7 August, but opted to join Northampton Town. He failed to make the Cobblers first team and on 18 October 1996, he returned to Wycombe Wanderers on non-contract terms, before moving to Colchester United on 28 November. He helped Colchester win promotion from Division Three via the play-off final at Wembley against former club Torquay. After 10 goals in 123 games for Colchester, Buckle returned to Exeter on a free transfer on 2 July 1999, signing a two-year contract. He sustained a serious ankle injury in the opening game of the new season and, although he made a full recovery and regained a first team place, he was one of many players transfer-listed by Exeter manager Noel Blake in May 2000. However, he remained at St. James' Park, playing in 43 games the following season and 25 the season after. Buckle then joined Football Conference side Aldershot Town in 2002, before dropping down a further division to play for Weymouth in 2003, in addition to being employed as a youth-team coach at Exeter. He was made caretaker manager at Weymouth after the club sacked Steve Claridge, obtaining a win and three draws in his four games in temporary charge. He left the club on 16 December 2004 to return in a non-paid playing role at Exeter, now themselves in non-League football. He made four appearances before joining Tiverton Town for a short time, playing in 12 games. In March 2005, Buckle returned to Exeter City once more, this time as player-coach under manager Alex Inglethorpe, continuing in this role under Inglethorpe's successor Paul Tisdale. Buckle continued to play regularly during this spell, making 70 appearances and eventually became assistant manager. Coaching and management =Exeter City= In his role as assistant manager, he helped lead Exeter City to the Conference National play-off final at Wembley at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season, although they lost to Morecambe. =Torquay United= After his time at Exeter City, Buckle was keen to pursue his own job as a manager and, in June 2007, he was appointed manager of relegated Torquay United by new Chief Executive Colin Lee, his former youth team manager at Brentford. In his first season at Plainmoor he led Torquay to a third-placed finish in the Conference Premier and thus a place in the end of season play- offs to get back into the Football League. Torquay faced Buckle's former club and local rivals Exeter City. Despite a 2‚Äì1 win in the away leg, Exeter hit back and Torquay lost 4‚Äì1 at home (5‚Äì3 on aggregate). Buckle also took Torquay to the FA Trophy final, however, that was also to end in disappointment as the Gulls were defeated 1‚Äì0 by Ebbsfleet United at Wembley. Despite a slow start to the next campaign, Torquay bounced back to again qualify for the play-offs and finished the league in fourth place. They defeated Histon in the semi- finals 2‚Äì1 on aggregate to set up a final against Cambridge United. Torquay beat Cambridge 2‚Äì0 with goals from Chris Hargreaves and Tim Sills to return to the Football League at the second attempt. In September 2009, Buckle signed a two-year contract extension following speculation that he was to be offered the vacant managerial position at another of his former clubs, Colchester United. After being in or hovering just above the relegation zone for much of the 2009‚Äì10 campaign, Buckle eventually led Torquay to 17th place in the table following a strong finish to the season, in which they kept a club record seven consecutive clean sheets. The next season proved more successful, with Torquay under Buckle spending much of the season in or just outside the play- off places. A seventh-placed finish, achieved on goal difference, led the club to play third-placed Shrewsbury Town in the play-off semi-final, which Torquay won 2‚Äì0 on aggregate. However, following a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Stevenage at Old Trafford in the play-off final on 28 May 2011, Buckle left the club to join newly relegated Bristol Rovers. =Bristol Rovers= Buckle's first act as Bristol Rovers manager was to successfully persuade Torquay assistant manager Shaun North, goalkeeper Scott Bevan and striker Chris Zebroski to join him. After signing a total of 19 players, and releasing or selling 19 of Rovers' existing players from the previous season's relegation, a run of four wins from the first ten games left the club in mid-table. However, things quickly worsened, with the club winning only two further league games before January and Buckle publicly falling out with Bristol Rovers' fan favourite Stuart Campbell, who he released from his contract in December 2011. Buckle's position at the club became increasingly unstable following home defeats to Crewe Alexandra and Plymouth Argyle that left the club just outside the relegation zone and, on 3 January 2012, he was sacked by Bristol Rovers after a 2‚Äì0 loss to struggling Barnet. =Luton Town= On 6 April 2012, 95 days after leaving Bristol Rovers, it was announced that Buckle had been appointed the new manager of Luton Town on an initial two-year contract until June 2014. At the time, Luton were sixth in the Conference Premier, one place below the play-offs, having been on a run of one win in their prior seven league games which had ultimately seen previous manager Gary Brabin sacked on 31 March 2012. Buckle watched from the stands as Luton lost 3‚Äì1 to Braintree Town on 7 April before officially taking charge the next day. There was an immediate turnaround in Luton's playing style and results under Buckle's management with the club securing a place in the play-offs by picking up 14 points from six games, keeping five clean sheets in the process. He led the club to the play- off final at Wembley Stadium after a 3‚Äì2 aggregate win against Wrexham in the semi-final, but lost 2‚Äì1 to York City in the decisive final game. After the defeat, Buckle announced his intention to trim the Luton squad, which had played out the 2011‚Äì12 season using 34 contracted professionals, and followed this up by allowing 12 players to leave. Stating that he wanted to \\"bring players into the club that are not failures\\", he signed, among others, former Stevenage captain Ronnie Henry, who had won two promotions in three years, striker Jon Shaw, who had scored 35 goals throughout the season, and midfielder Jonathan Smith, who had played 48 times the previous season for Swindon Town as they won promotion to League One and finished as runners-up in the Football League Trophy. After a solid start to the 2012‚Äì13 season, which saw Buckle's side keep pace with the leaders, Luton's league form soon collapsed with the club winning only three league games between November 2012 and February 2013. Buckle was in charge as Luton beat Premier League side Norwich City 1‚Äì0 away at Carrow Road on 26 January 2013 in the FA Cup Fourth Round, striker Scott Rendell's late goal ensuring that the club became the first non-League team in 24 years to defeat a top division side in the competition. However, just three weeks later he left the club by mutual consent for personal reasons. These were later revealed to be an imminent move abroad to the US with his wife, TV sports presenter Rebecca Lowe, who was fronting NBC's Premier League coverage in the country. =Metropolitan Oval= On 4 November 2013, the Metropolitan Oval, a United States Soccer Federation development academy and historic New York City soccer facility, announced the appointment of Buckle as Technical Director. He was appointed to oversee all soccer-related activities at the club which is one of the newest affiliates to the new MLS franchise club NYCFC. =Cheltenham Town= On 26 November 2014, it was announced that Buckle had become Cheltenham Town manager and will be on a twelve-month rolling contract at the club. He left the club on 13 February 2015 after only 79 days in charge. =Sacramento Republic= On 8 July 2015, Sacramento Republic announced Buckle as the new head coach to replace the departing Preki.https://www.sacbee.com/sports/mls/article26743135.html In September 2015, Buckle was also named Technical Director of the club. =Hartford Athletic= Buckle was appointed as USL Championship side Hartford Athletic's technical adviser in May 2019.

Designed by architect Martin Stern Jr., it operated from May 15, 1984 until September 16, 2014. History = The beginning = The Trump Organization, a company owned by real estate developer Donald Trump, began construction of the casino in June 1982. Harrah's, the gaming unit of Holiday Inn, joined as a partner a month later. Trump would oversee the construction, while Harrah's would operate the property, referred to as Harrah's Boardwalk, after opening. The property opened as Harrah's at Trump Plaza on May 14, 1984. The complex contained 614 rooms, seven restaurants, a health club, a 750-seat showroom and a 60,000 sq.ft. casino, all on a narrow 2.6-acre plot of land next to Caesars Atlantic City. Five months after opening, the name was changed to simply Trump Plaza, to avoid confusion with Harrah's Marina. Part of the reason for this is that Harrah's was commonly associated with and attracted low-rolling gamblers, but Trump had built 85 high-roller suites, which were rarely used. The casino performed poorly, with pre-tax profits of just $144,000 in the first half of 1985. The poor results exacerbated disagreements between Trump and Harrah's, leading to Trump buying out Harrah's interest in the property for $70 million in May 1986. In 1989, Trump paid $62 million to purchase the neighboring, unfinished Penthouse Boardwalk Hotel and Casino, including a hotel tower that had formerly been a Holiday Inn, and a nearby parking lot. Trump planned to expand the Plaza onto the Penthouse site. Trump also spent $63 million to purchase the bankrupt Atlantis Casino Hotel, separated from Trump Plaza by the Atlantic City Convention Hall, and rebranded it as the Trump Regency, a hotel annex to the Plaza. Trump Plaza hosted the WrestleMania IV and WrestleMania V events in 1988 and 1989 respectively. Although the World Wrestling Federation billed the events as being held at Trump Plaza, in reality Trump was only the sponsor of both events, which were held at the Atlantic City Boardwalk Hall. The casino was the scene of a notorious baccarat session in May 1990, in which the Japanese high roller Akio Kashiwagi lost $10 million.The impact of a finite bankroll on an even-money game The incident was later fictionalized in Martin Scorsese's film Casino. = 1990‚Äì2011 = Trump Plaza's revenues took a sharp decline in 1990 due to competition from its newly opened sister property, the Trump Taj Mahal. The casino narrowly averted default on a 1991 payment to bondholders by taking out a $25 million mortgage on its parking garage. Trump then negotiated a debt restructuring with the Plaza's creditors, under which their $250 million of debt would be exchanged for $200 million of bonds with a lower interest rate, plus $100 million of preferred stock. The plan was submitted as a prepackaged bankruptcy in March 1992. Construction of a $42-million expansion began in 1993. The plan called for demolition of the unfinished Penthouse casino, the addition of 30,000 square feet of gaming space, and renovation of the former Holiday Inn building to become Trump Plaza's East Tower, with 361 hotel rooms. The expansion was at the center of a major eminent domain court case, when Trump sought to obtain the property of Vera Coking, a retired homeowner whose house was adjacent to the Penthouse casino.\\"In Atlantic City, the widow vs. the real-estate mogul\\" . The Philadelphia Inquirer (February 14, 1997). Retrieved April 4, 2012. Coking, represented by the Institute for Justice, was victorious,Law Offices of Glenn A. Zeitz and plans to build a limousine parking lot were thwarted. In 1995, Trump granted ownership of Trump Plaza to his new publicly traded company, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (later Trump Entertainment Resorts). The company also acquired the Trump Regency hotel. The East Tower opened in two phases, in October 1995 and February 1996. The expansion continued with the May 1996 opening of Trump World's Fair, a $48-million renovation of the Trump Regency with an added casino, connected to Trump Plaza by a loggia across the Atlantic City Convention Hall. On May 24, 2011, Trump Entertainment Resorts announced that a decision would be made within two months to either sell the casino or to renovate and expand it, possibly with a joint venture partner. In February 2013, the company proposed to sell the property for $20 million to the Meruelo Group, a California-based company whose businesses include the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno. Meruelo planned to make significant investments in the property and rename it. The deal fell through when Carl Icahn, senior lender for Trump Plaza's mortgage, declined to approve the sale for the proposed price.Wittkowski, Donald. \\"Carl Icahn won't approve sale of Trump Plaza for $20M\\", The Press of Atlantic City. Accessed August 2, 2013. =Closure= 274x274px On July 12, 2014, it was reported that the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino would close on September 16, 2014, if a buyer was not found, putting an estimated 1,000 employees out of work. In early August 2014, Donald Trump filed a lawsuit requesting his name be removed from the facility, because it had fallen into disrepair, in violation of the licensing agreement for his name. Trump Plaza closed permanently on September 16, 2014. This was the fourth Atlantic City casino to close in 2014, after the Atlantic Club, Showboat, and Revel. The closure left approximately 1,300 employees out of work. The building was set to be demolished in the spring of 2018, except for the East Tower and the parking garage. However, on May 29, 2018, the demolition plans had been delayed until at least the following fall due to funding disputes. On December 14, 2018, another demolition deadline passed. Carl Icahn bought the deed to the land Trump Plaza sits on, and terminated the complicated lease on the land that drove potential buyers out in late December 2018. On June 11, 2020, mayor Marty Small Sr. announced that Icahn has submitted plans for the hotel towers to be imploded, as they were considered a danger to public safety because of failing debris. Demolition is expected by February 2021.  Hotel  Trump Plaza had 906 hotel rooms, and offered 5 different room styles for guests to choose from.

He regularly played about ten different roles for the company over these years, including the Pirate King in The Pirates of Penzance, Dick Deadeye in H.M.S. Pinafore, and the title character in The Mikado, which he played more than 3,000 times. Fancourt was famous for his melodramatic style, creating the controversial Mikado laugh that was later adopted by some of his successors.

Fancourt is both a fine singer and, within the Savoy convention, a fine and zestful actor with the gift of a dominating personality. Roderic's song 'When the night wind howls', as Fancourt sings it in the second act of Ruddigore, is at the meridian of that opera and one of the glories of Gilbert- and-Sullivan in the contemporary theatre.\\"Trewin, J. C. \\"Gilbert and Sullivan Then and Now\\" , reprinted from Far and Wide, September 1949 The Times later said, \\"nobody who heard it will ever forget his singing of 'When the night wind howls'.\\" Fancourt as Sergeant Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard Opinions differed about Fancourt's melodramatic style in his roles, especially his interpretation of his best-known role, that of the Mikado of Japan, and his famous Mikado laugh. Frederic Lloyd, who joined the D'Oyly Carte in 1951 and had studied the company's history, told an interviewer that Fancourt invented his interpretation, concerned that the earlier movements used during the Mikado's song could be taken as a Fagin-like caricature. According to Lloyd, Fancourt had said that, because of his Jewish background, \\"I just couldn't go through those movements, it would bother me\\", and Lloyd reported that, when Fancourt showed Rupert D'Oyly Carte and his stage director J.

Jessie Bond, who had played Pitti-Sing in the 1885 premi√®re, was unimpressed: \\"Who, I want to know, intended that the Mikado should prance about like a madman, hissing out his lines like a serpent? ... The raving monster we so often see now is not one bit like the suave and oily Mikado created [by Fancourt's teacher, Richard Temple] at the Savoy.\\"Bond, Chapter 14, accessed 4 April 2009 The Times thought that he \\"undoubtedly loses a good deal of the Mikado's humour... his 'humane Mikado' scene is the one which seems to have travelled farthest from the 'Savoy tradition'.\\"The Times, 21 September 1926, p. 12 A later Times review commented more favourably: \\"Mr Darrell Fancourt... can (and did) add a terrifying aspect to the benignity of his humaner punishment manifesto, and left us wondering how his vocal cords ever managed to function normally after those expressions of emphasis with which he punctuated its paragraphs.\\"The Times, 25 October 1932, p. 12 The Manchester Guardian praised Fancourt's fresh approach and added, \\"He makes more of the punishment-fitting-the-crime song than we can remember having seen from any other actor.\\"The Manchester Guardian, 16 November 1920, p. 6 The Pall Mall Gazette said, \\"Mr Fancourt has recognised that people can do with a 'thrill' in these Grand Guignol days. So he has given us a Mikado who really does curdle the blood, with a voice like a steam hammer slowly crushing a ton of Brazil nuts, and a make up of ghastly villainy, and a fiendish, gurgling laugh, which must be heard to be appreciated.\\"Bettany, unnumbered page Another critic described the sound of Fancourt's laugh as \\"a dragon getting up steam\\". With respect to Fancourt's portrayal of the Pirate King, fellow actor Henry Lytton told an interviewer, \\"The King should be a story book pirate, not a real one and blood thirsty to boot. But that's the way Mr. Fancourt plays it\\". Fancourt was a cricket fan, an avid golfer and a fine bridge player and was popular among his colleagues.Obituary, The Times, 31 August 1953, p. 15Darrell Fancourt profile at the Memories of the D'Oyly Carte website, accessed 2 August 2010 By the late 1940s, his health began to fail, and in 1950 he gave up the role of Mountararat. In his last year, he continued to perform although he was very ill. Fancourt received the OBE in June 1953 in the Coronation Honours shortly after announcing his forthcoming retirement.The Times, 22 June 1953, p. 3 The Illustrated London News commented, \\"He will be the greatest loss to professional Gilbert-and-Sullivan since Henry Lytton retired ‚Ä¶ Besides his voice and presence, he has the priceless gift of attack. To watch him attacking The Mikado is to watch high tide flooding across the beach: it is an irresistible surge and swell.\\"Trewin, J. C. \\"The World of the Theatre\\", Illustrated London News, 11 July 1953, p. 74 Fancourt was too ill to make his scheduled final appearance, and as a last gesture he asked a friend to take his make-up to his successor, Donald Adams. Fancourt died in August 1953 at the age of 67, 33 days after giving his last performance. Recordings Fancourt participated in nineteen D'Oyly Carte recordings between 1923 and 1950 in the following roles: Mountararat (1922, shared with Peter Dawson, and 1930), Dick Deadeye (1922, shared with Frederick Hobbs, 1930 and 1949), Sir Roderic (1924, 1931 and 1950), Arac (1925 and 1932), Colonel Calverley (1930 and 1952), Sir Marmaduke in an abridged Sorcerer (1933), the Mikado (1926, 1936 and 1950), the Pirate King (1931 abridged set and 1950), and Sergeant Meryll (1950). He also sang the title role in a 1926 BBC radio broadcast of The Mikado and appeared in a four-minute silent promotional film made of the D'Oyly Carte Mikado in 1926.

Chandrakona Film City The world's largest film city, the Prayag Film City, an integrated film-making complex and one-stop entertainment destination, is scheduled to open in phases beginning in 2012. See also - Ramoji Film City History A traceable history of Chandrakona and its adjoining areas begins to emerge about 690 A.D. when the Malla Dynasty was founded at Bishnupur. It must have been at that time a prosperous place, but not much else is certain. Historically, it was turbulent times; the anarchical period known as Matsyanyaya (‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡ßé‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶î‡¶Ø‡¶º) in the history of Bengal. But tucked into the less- populated, forest covered fringes of the Chotonagpur plateau, the kingdom of Bishnupur lived by its own standards. And thanks to its excellent supply- system of agriculturally rich areas irrigated by river Shilaboti and its canals, Chandrakona grew in eminence, though gradually. Its proximity to the Puri route helped greatly, since it remained a part of Utkal or Orissa for a considerable period beginning early 13th century. The Jagannath temple had been completed only half a century ago. 17th century scholar Jagamohan Pandit, in his Sanskrit geography-text Deshavali Vivriti, described Chandrakona as an important place in Bhan Desh - a land lying between the rivers Kangsabati and Shilaboti; a rich land where quality jute grew in abundance and sustained a renowned jute-textile industry. Cotton also grew, and the cotton-textile industry was almost equally famous.Its rivers and waterbodies yielded abundant fish and sustained a large population of fishermen.We must remember that this prosperity was gained even as the Mughals and the Pathans clashed over the terrain for dominance till the former emerged victorious. Raghunathgarh Rekha Deul The political stability required for this prosperity came Chandrakona's way as the chief of a Rajput contingent, Indraketu, established almost independent rule here in the early 15th century. At about the same time another Rajput, Gajapati Singh, assumed the rule of Bagri, lying west of Chandrakona. These two tiny kingdoms fought each other several times during the next centuries, so that their family trees and fate became inextricably entangled. Chandrakona thrived during the century-long rule of the Ketu kings. The town probably got its name from the third of them - Chandraketu. Jogesh Chandra Basu, a scholar on the history of Medinipur, says that Chandrakona was previously known as Mana. Chandraketu ruled during the early decades of the fifteenth century. The Gurudwara of Chandrakona dates from this time. Guru Nanakji and Mardanaji came to Chandrakona in 1510 on their way to Puri and set up a manji here which has now evolved into a gurudwara revered and visited by Sikhs from different parts of the state. During Mughal rule Chandrakona retained its status of a semi-independent kingdom. By the middle of the 16th century Birbhan Singh, a Chauhan, began a new line of rulers. They efficiently ruled over the town for about 150 years, till in the early eighteenth century Maharaj Kirtichandra of Burdwan overthrew Raghunath Singh, the last of them. However, most of what constitutes the glory of Chandrakona, its temple complexes and its large tanks, tell us of the interest the Bhan rulers took in public works as well as of their patronage of religion and art. The legendary prosperity of Chandrakona, a town with fifty-two market places and a network of fifty-three inter-linked roads, owed itself to the efficient administration of the Bhan rulers. Chandrakona came under the British East India Company in 1760. The textile industry was most hardly hit as a consequence. The famous weavers of Chandrakona had either to re-locate or to take up farming as profession. However, the town held its own as an important centre of trade and commerce. In the nineteenth century Chandrakona was known for producing quality brass utensils. It got its municipal administration in 1869 and Beverley's Census Report of Bengal, 1872, records that the town had a population of 21,311; that is to say, almost equal to its present population. Once a part of Hooghly district, the town was incorporated into the Ghatal subdivision of Medinipur district in 1872. Over the next six decades the population of the town depleted alarmingly. In 1931, it was reported to have a population of a little over 6000. The Temple of Malleswar Like its more famous neighbour Bishnupur, Chandrakona may also be termed a temple town. Its temples display the blending of several architectural styles - the Odissi Rekha-Deul, the char-chala and at-chala styles of Bengal, and so on. Some of them, like the one at Mitrasenpur, are decorated with excellent teracotta plates depicting events from the Mahabharata and the Avatars of Vishnu. The pancharatna temple of Malleswar is also a grand structure. But most of these temples have become dilapidated, and hardly any effort is being made to preserve these heritage structures. In addition to the temples, there are three Asthals i.e. monastic establishments of the Sri Vaishnava Ramanuja sampradaya hailing from the spiritual lineage of the Ahobila Mutt. Navaratna temple of Mitrasenpur The eminence of the Dharmathakur cult in Chandrakona points to the co-existence for centuries of Brahminical and non-Brahminical religions. Several Dharmathakur images are found at Gobindapur, Narahipur and Jayantipur localities of Chandrakona. The Shivagajan festival at the end of the Bengali year, one of the major religious festivals in Chandrakona, is also reminiscent of pre-Aryan rituals. Transportation Chandrakona is well connected by roads/highways to other important towns of South Bengal including Medinipur(42 km South West), Burdwan, and Bankura. State Highway 4 (West Bengal) connects the town to National Highway 6 (Kolkata-Mumbai) at Mechogram (60 km South East). The nearest railway station is Chandrakona Road railway station, 20 km West. Locals use bicycles and motorbikes for transportation within the town. Rickshaws, Battery operated rickshaw and cabs are also available. Education There are schools and colleges in Chandrakona Town. Institute of Science & Technology is a technology oriented private college established here in 2005. This institute is affiliated to Wbut. It is an emerging engineering & management college in West Medinipur district as well as in West Bengal. There is also another college named Chandrakona Vidyasagar Mahavidyalaya which is under Vidyasagar University. The schools of Chandrakona Town are- Chandrakona Jirat High School, Kalyanshri J D Girls School, Malleswarpur Sarada Vidyapith High School and Atasi Smriti High School. There is also a non- governmental educational organization to help the poor meritorious students named Rakshabandhan For Education. Under Chandrakona Block-II, there is a village named Kiageria, 3 km from the Town. In this village, a non -conventional school called \\" School in the Cloud\\"(www.theschoolinthecloud.org/blog Chandrakona) has been organized and established by Sarbik Palli Kalyan Kendra, a 27 years old NGO, in which village children aged from 4 to 14 years old have been learning through Internet/skype of any subjects of their own without any teachers( Self Organized Learning Environment).This unique system has been introduced worldwide, by Prof Dr. Sugata Mitra, TED Talks prize winner‚Äì 2013, of New Castle University, U.K. Health There is a hospital in Chandrakona town. People of Chandrakona and its nearest areas mainly depend on that hospital. Culture \\"The number of temples that are still there in Chandrakona is a matter of wonder.\\" - Binoy Ghosh, historianGhosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, , part II, 1976 edition, pages 95- 97, Prakash Bhaban, Kolkata. Chandrakona and its surrounding areas have numerous temples, some built of laterite, and some are brick-built. These temples are superb articulation of local architectural styles and present a wide array of terracotta decoration. Unfortunately, many of the temples have fallen, a few have been distastefully painted or spoiled by inexperienced restoration and others lie uncared for.

Early life and education  His father was Mirza Mahmoud Shirazi, a merchant, who died when Abolqasem was an infant. His mother was the daughter of Iran's first modern physicist and astronomer, Mirza Abdulqaffar Nadjm ol- Molk. Abdulqaffar, who taught mathematics and physics at Dar ul-Funun, took Abolqasem under his custody after Abolqasem was orphaned. Abolqasem received his basic education from his grandfather and later inherited his grandfather's title of 'Nadjm ol-Molk' (star of the nation) after Mirza Abdulqaffar's retirement. He studied at the Tehran School of Political Sciences.  Diplomatic career  After graduation he entered the service of the ministry of foreign affairs (Iran) in 1912 as an attach√©. He was Iran's ambassador to the Third Reich, but was appointed to France upon his own request just prior to the outbreak of the second world war. In 1937, when Nadjm was Iran's ambassador to France, the French journal L'Europe Nouvelle criticized the economic condition of Iran. Reza Shah Pahlavi demanded an apology and received one. A French columnist reopened the wound one month later by rehearsing the incident under the punning headline // n'y avait pas la de quoi fouetter un Shah. This was a parody of the French phrase \\"There was nothing there with which to beat a cat\\", (playing on the words 'Shah' and 'chat', which is French for cat) suggesting that the King of Kings had made a fuss about nothing. The poor pun was enough to make Reza Shah Pahlavi immediately recall Nadjm to Tehran \\"for an explanation\\", and withdraw his promise to lend Iranian art objects to the coming Paris International Exhibition which was planned for May 1937.- Chat and Shah, Time (magazine), Monday, February 01, 1937. Nadjm later served as Iran's ambassador to Japan, until the relations between the two countries were severed due to Iran's declaration of war to the Axis in April 1943. Nadjm was summoned to Tehran and the Japanese delegation were ordered to leave Tehran at the same timeIranian Political Studies and Research Institute Archives, PSRI; The website of Iranian Embassy in Tokyo. He was then appointed as the ambassador to Afghanistan. As a neighboring country and a Persian- speaking monarchy, Afghanistan was considered very important and the post of ambassador in Kabul had more significance attached to it than it has had in more modern times.  Political career  Pahlavi era He was the minister of finance in Ebrahim Hakimi's cabinet and tried to fight corruption, but was held back by interference from the royal family. This resulted in his resignation and the downfall of the cabinet. These events are described by Mehdiqoli Hedayat in his memoirs: Abolqaasem Nadjm, second from the right, in a meeting of the Iranian Oil Commission. His last government job was as the governor of the oil-rich Khuzestan province. He resigned from this post, citing interference from the royal family in his day-to-day governance of the province. He was elected as a senator in the first Senate and served only one term. During this time, he was a member of the Oil Commission, a group of politicians whose work eventually resulted in the nationalization of the Iranian oil industry http://www2.irib.ir/occasions/naft%5CNaftEN.HTM.  Later years  Nadjm spent the last 30 years of his life in retirement. Long after retirement from politics, Nadjm retained his good name as one of the few Pahlavi era politicians who were clean of financial and ethical corruption. Near the end of his life, the Shah, embattled by the Iranian revolution, called on him to return to the government as a part of the reforms intended to quell the revolutionary fervor. The ailing Nadjm could not comply. Abolghassem Nadjm died in Tehran at the age of 89, shortly after the Iranian Revolution. His brother Mohammad Hossein Nadjm was also an Iranian diplomat, who served as Iranian ambassador to Lebanon and charg√© d'affaires in Paris.

The school was founded in 1971, and the new building opened in 1972 after repairs due to the catastrophic flooding caused by Tropical Storm Agnes. The school was named after Most Rev. Michael J. Hoban, second Bishop of Scranton (1899‚Äì1926). Bishop Hoban's colors were green and gold, and the school's nickname was the Argents. The last graduating class of Bishop Hoban graduated on May 24, 2007. Bishop Hoban High School closed on July 1, 2007, and became part of a consolidation of the four diocesan high schools of Luzerne County (see below). The building now houses Holy Redeemer High School. The largest high school of the Diocese of Scranton, Bishop Hoban had an annual enrollment of around 650 (grades 9 through 12) with nearly 60 faculty and administrators. The school was accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. Academics The curriculum required four years of English and Theology, one year of Western Civilization, two years of American History, three years of Natural Science, three years of Mathematics, two years of a modern or classical language, and a physical education course each year. Many electives were also offered, such as art and music (several), Journalism, QBASIC, C++ Programming, Law Education, Accounting, Survey of Dramatic Literature, Environmental Science, and Statistics. Many AP courses were offered, in subjects such as English Literature, American History, American Government, Chemistry, Java Programming, Psychology, and Studio Art. Bishop Hoban maintained a cooperative agreement with Wilkes University to allow interested, qualified students to pursue college-level Calculus courses there during their senior year. The school's drama program was also popular with musicals under the direction of Timothy Day, and Paul Winarski over the years, and a stage workshop run by Rev. Joseph Gilbert. A large portion of the faculty held master's degrees in their fields; one faculty member held a doctorate. End of the Bishop Hoban Era On January 17, 2007, the Diocese of Scranton announced that Bishop Hoban would consolidate with three other Catholic high schools in Luzerne County (Bishop Hafey, Bishop O'Reilly, and Seton Catholic), effective July 1, 2007. . The Bishop Hoban building is now used as the new school, Holy Redeemer High School (announced by the Diocese January 30) . This plan was originally proposed by Meitler Consultants, Inc, of Wisconsin in late 2006. On February 27, 2007, the Scranton Diocese announced that Holy Redeemer would be led by Mr. James J. Redington, Principal, and Ms. Susan W. Dennen, Associate Principal . At that time, Mr. Redington was the principal of Seton Catholic and Ms. Dennen served in that role at Bishop O'Reilly. Holy Redeemer's colors are red, white, and gold, and the school nickname is the Royals. After the course registration process was completed, a list of faculty who had been chosen to teach at the new school was also released. Bishop Hoban's final Mass was held on May 31, 2007, and was attended by alumni & former principals Msgr. Tressler and Mr. Majikes. Msgr. Joseph Rauscher, President of the Board of Pastors, presided and gave the homily, in which he encouraged the students to look forward to the future and to take what Hoban had taught them and bring it to the world. The ceremony also included presentations of symbols to remind the students of the Hoban legacy and concluded with the final public singing of the Alma Mater. 2006-07 Administration *Rev.

It is categorized under . Oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity in a given organism may be due to activity of malic enzyme, pyruvate kinase, malate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase and PEP carboxykinase or the activity of \\"real\\" oxaloacetate decarboxylases. The latter enzymes catalyze the irreversible decarboxylation of oxaloacetate and can be classified into (i) the divalent cation-dependent oxaloacetate decarboxylases and (ii) the membrane-bound sodium-dependent and biotin- containing oxaloacetate decarboxylases from enterobacteria.  Kinetic Properties  An oxaloacetate decarboxylase from the family of divalent cation dependent decarboxylases was isolated from Corynebacterium glutamicum in 1995 by Jetten et al. This enzyme selectively catalyzed the decarboxylation of oxaloacetate to pyruvate and CO2 with a Km of 2.1mM, Vmax of 158 umol, and kcat of 311 s^-1. Mn2+ was required for enzymatic activity with a Km of 1.2mM for Mn2+. A oxaloacetate decarboxylase found in mitochondria and soluble cytoplasm was isolated and purified from rat liver cells in 1974 by Wojtcak et al. The enzyme was not activated by divalent cations nor inhibited by chelating agents. The determined Km value was 0.55mM and the pH optimum for the enzyme between 6.5 and 7.5.  Cytoplasmic Enzymes  Found in different microorganisms such as Pseudomonas, Acetobacter, C. glutamicum, Veillonella parvula, and A. vinelandii, cytoplasmic oxaloacetate decarboxylases are dependent on the presence of divalent cations such as Mn2+, Co2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, or Ca2+. These enzymes are inhibited by acetyl-CoA and ADP.  Membrane-Bound Enzymes  Membrane bound oxaloacetate decarboxylase was the first enzyme of the Na+ transport decarboxylase family demonstrated to act as primary Na+ pump. This enzyme family includes methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase, malonate decarboxylase, and glutanoyl-CoA decarboxylase, all of which are found exclusively in anaerobic bacteria.; Decarboxylating the beta-keto acid of oxaloacetate affords the necessary free energy to pump sodium ions across the lipid bilayer. The resulting sodium gradient drives the synthesis of ATP, solute transport, and motility. The overall reaction catalyzed by the pump is the exchange of two intracellular Na+ ions for one extra cellular H+ ion; the reaction is initiated by the enzyme-catalyzed decarboxylation of oxaloacetate in the carboxyltransferase domain of the alpha subunit, yielding pyruvate and carboxybiotin. The oxaloacetate decaboxylase pump is also reversible: at high concentrations of extracellular Na+, the pump will couple downhill movement of Na+ into the cytosol with the carboxylation of pyruvate to form oxaloacetate. Members of this family of enzymes are typically trimers, composed of alpha, beta and gamma subunits. The beta and gamma subunits are integral membrane proteins. The ~45kDa beta subunit has nine transmembrane segments which serve to couple the decarboxylation of the carboxybiotin to the translocation of Na+ from the cytoplasm to the periplasm. The small ~9kDa gamma subunit is an integral membrane protein with a single helix at the N-terminus, followed by a hydrophilic C-terminal domain which interacts with the alpha subunit. The gamma subunit is essential for the overall stability of the complex, and likely serves as an anchor to hold the alpha and beta subunits in place. Furthermore, the gamma subunit significantly accelerates the rate of oxaloacetate decarboxylation in the alpha subunit, and this correlates with the coordination of a Zn2+ metal ion by several residues at the hydrophilic C-terminus. The alpha subunit, which is ~65kDa, is a biotinylated peripheral membrane protein on the cytosolic side of the membrane. Within the alpha subunit is the carboxyl transferase (CT) domain, oxaloacetate decarboxylase gamma association domain, and biotin carboxyl carrier domain. The crystal structure of the CT domain forms a TIM barrel fold in a dimer formation that coordinates with a Zn2+ ion in a catalytic site. The enzyme is completely inactivated by specific mutagenesis of Asp17, His207, and His209, which serve as ligands for the Zn2+ metal ion, or by Lys178 near the active site, suggesting that Zn2+ as well as Lys178 are essential for catalysis.

The area between the Bhagirathi and the Jalangi, which flows through the middle of the subdivision, is known as Kalantar, a low-lying tract of black clay soil. A big part of the subdivision forms the Krishnanagar-Santipur Plain, which occupies the central part of the district. The Jalangi, after flowing through the middle of the subdivision, turns right and joins the Bhagirathi. On the south-east, the Churni separates the Krishnanagar-Santipur Plain from the Ranaghat-Chakdaha Plain. The east forms the boundary with Bangladesh.The subdivision is moderately urbanized. 20.795% of the population lives in urban areas and 79.205% lives in rural areas.

Types of antique radio =Morse receivers= The first radio receivers used a coherer and sounding board, and were only able to receive CW continuous wave (CW) transmissions, encoded with Morse code (wireless telegraphy). Later wireless telephonytransmission and reception of speech became possible, although Morse code transmission continued in use until the 1990s. All the following sections concern speech-capable radio, or wireless telephony. =Early home-made sets= Homemade two tube radio from 1958 regenerative radio The idea of radio as entertainment took off in 1920, with the opening of the first stations established specifically for broadcast to the public such as KDKA in Pittsburgh and WWJ in Detroit. More stations opened in cities across North America in the following years and radio ownership steadily gained in popularity. Radio sets from before 1920 are rarities, and are probably military artifacts. Sets made prior to approximately 1924 were usually made on wooden breadboards, in small cupboard style cabinets, or sometimes on an open sheet metal chassis. Homemade sets remained a strong sector of radio production until the early 1930s. Until then there were more homemade sets in use than commercial sets. Early sets used any of the following technologies: * Crystal set * Crystal set with carbon or mechanical amplifier * Basic Tuned Radio Frequency (TRF) Sets * Reaction Sets * Super-Regenerative Receiver * Superheterodyne Receiver Crystal sets These basic radios used no battery, had no amplification and could operate only high-impedance headphones. They would receive only very strong signals from a local station. They were popular among the less wealthy due to their low build cost and zero run cost. Crystal sets had minimal ability to separate stations, and where more than one high power station was present, inability to receive one without the other was a common problem. Some crystal set users added a carbon amplifier or a mechanical turntable amplifier to give enough output to operate a speaker. Some even used a flame amplifier. Tuned radio frequency sets Tuned radio frequency sets (TRF sets) were the most popular class of early radio, primarily because the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) had a monopoly on the superheterodyne circuit patents and it was more profitable for companies to jump into radio manufacturing TRF sets. These used several valves (tubes) to provide RF amplification, detection, and audio amplification. Early TRF sets only operated headphones, but by the mid-1920s it was more common to use additional amplification to power a loudspeaker, despite the expense. The sound quality produced from \\"moving-iron\\" speakers used on such sets is sometimes described as torturous, although by the late 1920s the Kellogg-Rice dynamic (moving-coil) speaker had begun to find favor due to its superior sound-reproduction ability. Speakers widely used on TRF sets included: * Moving iron speaker (horn or cone) * tin can, magnet & wire based speakers * moving coil speaker TRF sets used no regeneration, and were merely several stages (typically three) of tuned RF amplifiers in series feeding a detector tube which extracted the audio intelligence from the RF signal. TRF sets, depending on the number of stages they employed, could have poor-to-superb sensitivity (ability of the set to pick up faint signals) and corresponding selectivity (ability to parse adjacent stations from one another). Audio reproduction quality of TRF sets was limited by the available loudspeakers. \\"High Fidelity\\" was not to become a radio marketing concept until the mid-1930s and was not realized until the advent of FM broadcasting. Reaction sets, also known as regenerative receivers, rely on positive feedback to achieve adequate gain. This approach provided high performance with a minimum number of expensive vacuum tubes, but these receivers tended to radiate RF interference in their immediate vicinity. Consequently, there was a significant amount of hostility by neighbors of \\"regen\\" set users over maladjusted radios transmitting squealing noises and blocking reception on nearby properties. Early TRF sets had typically two or three tuning knobs and tube filament voltage-control rheostats, all of which had to be set correctly to receive a station. Later (late 1920s) TRF sets had ganged tuning (one knob was used to control all stage tuning capacitors simultaneously), AC house current operation, and eliminated the filament voltage adjustments. All of these changes greatly simplified operation and made radio a household appliance that even a small child could operate, instead of the highly skilled hobbyists of the brief preceding generation. Reaction sets also had the filament adjustment rheostats for each valve, and again settings had to be right to achieve reception. Superheterodyne receivers In the era of early radio, only RCA and a select number of competing \\"prestige\\" radio manufacturers could afford to build a superheterodyne receiver (superhet). RCA had exclusive rights to the superheterodyne circuit patents and extracted high licensing fees from other companies who sought to build superhet sets. RCA also vigorously prosecuted patent infringers. This situation helped propel RCA to the forefront of radio manufacturers in the 1920s due to the higher efficiency of the superhet circuit- a situation which lasted until the patents expired in the early 1930s, at which time a flood of low-cost superheterodyne receivers hit the market. Early (RCA-patent-era) superhets were often used with the relatively expensive moving coil speakers, which offer a quality of sound unavailable from moving iron speakers. Most post-1932 commercial radios were superhets, and this technology is still in widespread use in radio receivers today, implemented with transistors or integrated circuits. The advantages of superhets are: * Excellent sensitivity and selectivity * Ease of designing the set for multiple-band operation, enabling reception of foreign broadcasts (\\"Shortwave\\") * High stability * Well controlled bandwidth * Well shaped RF passband avoids the uncontrolled tone variations of TRF sets, and gives good selectivity The disadvantages before about 1932 were: * High patent-licensing costs. * Need for specialized test equipment to perform conversion-stage filter alignments. In general the technical and manufacturing advantages of the superhet ensured that the TRF set became quickly obsolete once the patent restrictions on superhets were eliminated. =Farm radios= Prior to the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, the vast majority of rural farms in America did not have electricity. Many rural areas of the Midwest and South did not receive commercial power until the 1960s. Until that point, special radios were made to run on DC power. The earliest so-called \\"farm radios\\" used the \\"A\\", \\"B\\", and \\"C\\" batteries typical of 1920s radio sets; these farm radios were identical to those used in cities. Somewhat later, farm radios were made to be run on 6 volts from a car or tractor battery, using an electromechanical vibrator to create a pulsating DC current that could be stepped up though a transformer to create the high voltage needed for the plates of the tubes- exactly as contemporary car radios did. Other farm radios were designed to run on 32 volts DC, from a bank of lead-acid storage batteries charged from a gas powered generator or a wind-charger. The 32-volt system could also power other specially made appliances as well as electric lights around the farm. Other farm radios, especially from the late 1930s to the 1950s, reverted to using a large \\"A-B\\" dry cell that provided both 90 volts for the tube plates and 1.5 volts for the tube filaments, as did most tube-based portable radios of that era. =Foxhole radios= World War 2 created widespread urgent need for radio communication, and foxhole sets were built by people without access to traditional radio parts. A foxhole radio is a simple crystal sets radio receiver cobbled together from whatever parts one could make (which were very few indeed) or scrounged from junked equipment. Such a set typically used salvaged domestic wiring for an antenna, a double- edged safety-razor blade and pencil lead (or bent safety-pin) for a detector, and a tin can, magnet and some wire for an earpiece. Razor blades of the era were chemically coated (\\"blued\\") and this coating could function as a diode, in the same way that a galena-catwhisker detector operates. =Wooden consoles= The console radio was the center piece of household entertainment in the era of radio. They were big and expensive, costing hundreds of dollars in the late 1930s and were often coupled with a phonograph. Tending to be a major acquisition for a middle-class family, these large radios were usually placed in living rooms. Most early console radios were tall and narrow, but as the years went on they got shorter and wider in accordance with the Art Deco design precepts which had become popular Consumer console radios were made by RCA, Philco, General Electric, Montgomery Ward (under the Airline brand name), Sears (under the Silvertone brand name), Westinghouse, Motorola, Zenith and others. Brands such as Zenith made a few high priced models (\\"Stratosphere\\") mainly produced moderately priced radios Some premium makers such as E. H. Scott and Silver-Marshall started around $500‚Äì$800 range in the 1930s and 1940s. =Table-top wood-cased radios= Wood tabletop set from 1941 Wood-look Bakelite Tabletop set from the late '40s Table top radios came in many forms: * \\"Cathedral style\\", an upright rectangular box with a rounded top * \\"Tombstone style\\" are rectangular boxes that are tall and narrow like a tombstone * \\"Table top\\" are rectangular, with width being the larger dimension. Table top radios are usually placed in the kitchen, living room, or bedroom, and sometimes used out on the porch. =Bakelite= The availability of the first mass-produced plastic Bakelite allowed designers much more creativity in cabinet styling, and significantly reduced costs. However, Bakelite is a very brittle plastic, and dropping a radio could easily crack or break the case. Bakelite is a brown-black mouldable thermosetting plastic, and is still used in some products today. In the 1930s some radios were manufactured using Catalin, which is the phenolic resin component of bakelite, with no organic filler added, but nearly all historic bakelite radios are the standard black-brown bakelite color. Bakelite as used for radio cabinets was traditionally brown, and this color came from the ground walnut shell flour added to the thermosetting phenolic resin as an extender and strengthening agent. =Plastic era= Early '50s AC/DC tabletop radio '50s transistor radio The affordability of more modern light coloured thermoplastics in the 1950s made brighter designs practical. Some of these thermoplastics are slightly translucent. =Early transistor radios= The invention of the transistor made it possible to produce very small portable radios that did not need a warm-up time, and ran on much smaller batteries. They were convenient, though the prices were initially high and the sound quality of early models was not nearly as good as tube radios. Later models equalled or surpassed tube models in audio quality. Transistors also made it possible to manufacture portable FM radios, which was impractical using tubes. Transistor radios were available in many sizes from console to table-top to matchbox. Transistors are still used in today's radios, though the integrated circuit containing a large number of transistors has surpassed the use of singly packed transistors for the majority of radio circuitry. Transistor radios appeared on the market in 1954, but at a high price. By the 1960s, reduced prices and an increase in desire for portability made them very popular. There was something of a marketing war over the number of transistors sets contained, with many models named after this number. Some sets even had non-functional reject transistors soldered to the circuit board, doing absolutely nothing, so the sales pitch could advertise a higher number of transistors. Vacuum tube radios and early transistor radios were hand assembled. Today radios are designed with the assistance of computers and manufactured with much greater use of machinery. Today's radios are usually uneconomical to repair because mass production and technological improvements in numerous areas have made them so inexpensive to buy, while the cost of human labor and workshop overheads have increased greatly in comparison. Typical insides of an antique radio, showing the vacuum tubes. =Car radios= The earliest car radios appeared not long after commercial radio broadcasts commenced, but were experimental only. They were expensive, required a large aerial, reception was inconsistent, and they required adjustment in use, which was not very practical. By the early 1930s most car radios, no longer experimental, were superheterodynes and used a vibrator power supply to step up the low voltage to high voltage (\\"B+\\" voltage of anywhere from 90 to 250 volts) for the vacuum tubes. Vibrators are relatively unreliable as electromechanical components of limited life, buzz audibly, and produce radio interference. A few radios used a bulkier and more expensive motor-generator or motor-alternator set called a \\"dynamotor\\" that spun a high-voltage generator or alternator using a 6 or 12V DC motor. Filaments were powered using 6V and later 12V DC power from the vehicle's electrical system directly. With the introduction of transistors, the earlier ones suitable for audio frequencies only, car radios were valve sets with a transistor output stage; makers promoted them as transistor sets. Some historic car radios badged as transistorised are in reality of this type. All- transistor sets eventually replaced sets with vacuum tube after transistor technology improved and prices fell significantly. Chrysler and Philco announced an all-transistor car radio in the April 28, 1955, edition of the Wall Street Journal.Wall Street Journal, \\"Chrysler Promises Car Radio With Transistors Instead of Tubes in '56\\", April 28th 1955, page 1 This Philco car radio model was the first tubeless auto set in history to be developed and produced.Los Angeles Times, \\"Chrysler Announces New Transistor Radio\\", May 8th 1955, page A20 It was a $150 option for 1956 Chrysler and Imperial cars and hit the showroom floor on October 21, 1955.http://wpchryslermuseum.org/page.aspx?pid=436 Warm-up time Most valve sets needed a few seconds for the valves to heat up, though there were exceptions. Warm-up times changed as valves went through several generations of design. * Bright emitter valves universal in the early 1920s came on in a small fraction of a second, effectively instantly. * Direct dull emitters typical of the late '20s and 1930s came on in around a second. This type of valve continued to be popular in battery sets for several decades more. * Indirect emitters used in more or less all mains valve radios from the late 1930s onward were slow to reach emission temperature, with wait times routinely exceeding 10 seconds. * The last generation of valves was nuvistors. These tiny devices reached emission temperature fairly quickly. Use of vintage radios =Line-Operated Commercial Sets= Using vintage radios generally requires inspection and repair or refurbishment before they can be safely operated. In most cases, at least the power supply section of line- operated radios must be refurbished to prevent damage to other components, but it can be assumed that most of the vintage capacitors are electrically \\"leaky\\" and that the electrolytic capacitors in the power supply have either lost capacity (leading to excess \\"hum\\") or shorted (potentially causing a damaging or fire-inducing short-circuit). In their original state, they complied only with the limited safety standards of the time, and almost none used fuses. AC- operated radios using power transformers require repair and refurbishment of the power supply section before operation, as any failures are likely to stress or damage the power transformer, necessitating a costly repair. AC/DC sets using a no power transformer may be either \\"curtain burners\\" using a resistance cord to drop the line voltage, or warm/hot chassis radios using a series-string filament circuit where the voltages add up to the line voltage. They were named \\"AC/DC\\" because they operated on either AC or DC line voltage, which was not possible with a transformer-based set. :\\"Curtain Burner\\" sets were common in the early 1930s \\"midget\\" sets. The name is an indication of the problem‚Äîthe line cord contained resistors to drop the voltage and dissipated substantial power in the cord itself. When operating properly and the line cord was stretched to full length, the cord got \\"warm\\" and was safe enough (until the heat made the rubber insulation crack). When the cord was coiled up or otherwise insulated (like from a curtain resting on it) it could get very hot, and frequently caused a fire. Resistance line cords are no longer available and the vintage cords are no longer serviceable, so the radio must be partially redesigned with either a dropping capacitor, dropping resistor, or some other workaround for safe operation. :AC/DC sets lacking resistance line cords instead used tube filaments in series that added up to the line voltage, effectively moving the resistance into the radio. They use conventional line cords. These are the most common vintage radio in the US after about 1940 or so, as they were very inexpensive to manufacture. They are much less common in areas with 240 mains power, as there were few common tubes built to operate at the high voltages required. BC (medium wave/\\"AM\\") only radios like the \\"All American 5\\" design, and later AM/FM radios with more tubes, and even televisions were build using the same idea, because of the simplicity and low cost possible. Either type of AC/DC radio can present the \\"hot\\" line of the line voltage on the chassis of the radio (\\"hot chassis\\") or isolated from the chassis by a single capacitor (\\"warm chassis\\"). This presents a safety problem, as depending on the direction of the non-polarized plug, the hot side of the line voltage can be connected directly to all the metal parts of the radio any time it is plugged in, regardless of whether it is powered on or not. Proper repair or refurbishment requires an isolation transformer to remove the live connection, and care should be taken to never touch any metal part of the radio (chassis mounting screws, bare control shafts, etc.) when the radio is plugged in. Many radios with a hot chassis use interlocks on the back to ensure that the line is disconnected before the rear can be accessed for tube replacement. Later transistor-based AC table radios typically used power transformers and operate safely, but with likely hum from failed electrolytic capacitors in the power supply, and likely low volume from other failed electrolytic coupling capacitors. There were a few early transistor table radios using \\"hot chassis\\" principles, but these are very rare. =Early Battery-Operated Sets= The minority of all-in-one commercial ac mains sets that appeared in the 1930s are plug & play. Such sets should be checked for the possible existence of live metalwork accessible to the user, and a general safety check is advisable. Many will need a repair of some sort. However other not all-in-one types of pre-Depression-era radio are more demanding to put into service, being a long way from plug & play. Setting up such radios requires a bit of electronics skill. There are several issues with them: * Failed components are to be expected, and these must be fault-found then repaired * Repair of parts is practical, but not trivial * Some of these sets never worked very well and may benefit from some skilled debugging * 3 power supplies are needed to replace the originally used A, B and C batteries(unless self-biasing is used) (or DC mains). * A little detective work is needed to find out what PSU voltages are needed * A long wire antenna will need to be erected * Fitting a local ground (earth) is frequently necessary, and quite easy * A high impedance speaker (or transformer) is needed * Some means to keep fingers away from the exposed live connections on the rear is wise, and often legally obligatory. * With 1920s and earlier sets using bright emitter valves, the end user should understand the use of the filament rheostats to avoid rapid valve failure. * The user should realise that permitting historic reaction sets to oscillate causes them to transmit interference, which is illegal. * Negative supply DC mains sets should have their ground capacitor bypassed to convert them from live chassis to earthed chassis. Sound quality The sound quality of antique radios depends on the technologies used in the set. The type of speaker is the main differentiator, with mains or battery also making a significant difference. All valve sets produce 2nd harmonic distortion, which is fairly euphonic. Some also produce significant 3rd harmonic distortion, which is less pleasant to the ear. Discussion is often heard about the distortion of triode versus pentode valves, and single ended versus push pull, which affect the types of distortion produced, but these issues seem to be secondary in practice to the ones discussed in this article, and are already well covered in other articles. =Loudspeaker Types= Moving iron speaker Homemade pre-war sets usually used some form of moving iron speaker, usually horn or cone loaded, and occasionally disc loaded. The sound quality of such radios is generally unimportant, since almost any defect in the audio signal will be masked by the butchery visited upon it by the loudspeaker. The question of sound quality is heavily dominated by the speaker in these cases. Moving iron speakers suffer the following defects: * Gross non-linearity * Heavy intermodulation distortion * Little bass response * Poor treble response * Strong undamped resonance in the middle of the audio spectrum * Noisy chattering when presented with a loud bass note * Tendency of the moving iron to stick to the pole piece, resulting in a 'whack' sound followed by very little sound output. * Gross impedance mismatch * Need for adjustment * Prone to demagnetisation * Horn speakers were strongly directional * Cone speakers were readily damaged The sound of moving iron speakers has a strong unmistakable character. They were far from faithful in their reproduction of audio, and their technical specifications were poorly controlled. An example of this is their electrical impedance, which varied across the audio spectrum by a ratio of more than 100:1. It is not unusual for an electronics student, on hearing some of the specs of these devices, to conclude that they could not have been capable of reproducing speech. Yet they do, and with a sound that can not be mistaken for anything else. Inductor dynamic speaker These enjoyed brief success but were quickly eclipsed by moving coil speakers. The Inductor Dynamic Speaker solved the worst problems of earlier moving iron types, and provided a relatively pleasant listening experience. The main defect of ID speakers was poor treble response, giving them a characteristic dull drone. Moving coil speaker These speakers were mostly of sufficient quality that the radio's characteristics become significant. Transformer coupled sets suffered loss of bass & reduced treble, grid leak sets where rf and af were amplified by the same valve gave some nonlinearity, and output stages always provided a little more non-linearity. However the quality of a moving coil equipped set can be pleasant, and mistakable for a modern portable radio.

Geography  Chaumuhan is located on the NH2 highway, from the Delhi Badarpur Border. It lies from the neighboring city of Kosi Kalan and from Tahashil Chhata.  History  Brahma Vimohan Leela took place during Krishna's time. Bewildered by the simplicity of Krishna as a child, Brahma stole Krishna's calves and cowherds. Realizing this, Krishna expanded into the same number of calves and cowherds and life remained undisturbed in Braj. Brahma realized his mistake and did penance at the Brahma Jhaadi (Chaumuha) and apologized to Krishna there. He did so after bathing in the nearby Chandra Sarovar (which was partly restored by the Braj Foundation). Because of this pastime the village was named Chaumuha, indicating four heads of Brahma. Only two temples of Brahma Ji exist; one in Pushkar (Ajmer) and the other in Chaumuha.

Lord Brahma was amazed at the act especially since Krishna was known to be an incarnation of Vishnu and drinking from a mortal's used cup was unacceptable behavior from a God. Lord Brahma then grew suspicious and to test him he made all cows and cowherd friends of Krishna disappear. Krishna at once understood this divine game and extended himself to take the form of all his missing cows and cowherd friends to replace them so that their absence would go unnoticed. Brahma realized his mistake and asked forgiveness through penance that he did at the site that became Chandrasarovar. Lord Brahma brought the Moon God (Chandra) with him who built Chandrasarovar. In its clean and pure waters Brahma bathed before beginning his penance.

It is situated on the banks of the river Periyar.  Demographics  India census, Chengamanad had a population of 29,775. Males constitute 49% of the population and females 51%. Chengamanad has an average literacy rate of 80%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; with male literacy of 82% and female literacy of 78%. 11% of the population is under 6 years of age. Etymology According to legends the place derives its name from Jangama Muni who is said to have done penance in a cave in the munikkal Guhalaya. The place was initially called Jangamanad which later became chengamanad. Another account says that the name Chengamand is due to the special kind of soil . The Ancient legend of Thoma, Mathai and Pylee The ancient scriptures record the arrival of three mysterious men to the village. Not much is known about these men, except that they were part of the growth and development of the villagers. They spend much time researching for unknown purposes and communicating with the local people only on occasions for various requirement. The names of these men are mentioned among the people even today. Sightings of these men have also been mentioned in various surrounding parts of Annamanada.  Chengamanad Mahadeva Temple  The Chengamand Mahadeva temple is the centre of attraction in Chengamanad and is one of the important Shiva temples in Aluva. The main deity, Shiva is in the form of Kirata Murthi facing East. The shrine of Shree Parvathi and Ganapathi faces towards west and south respectively. The temple is owned by 10 Brahmin families. They are \\"Thaliyal Mana, Makaramattathu Mana, Maliekkal Mana, Padamattathu Mana, Padappa Mana, Vaippan Mana, Edaprambilli Mana, Mozhully Mana, Valiyakodathu Mana, and Azhvanchery Thamprakkal\\". Since the members of these families are spread out in various places and the management of the temple became difficult, the administrative powers was transferred to the \\"Urazhma Devaswam Board\\". As of now, the temple administration is done by the \\"Urazhma Devaswam Board\\" with active guidance from a committee formed by the local people. The annual festival of the temple comes in Dhanu. It begins with kodiyettu (hoisting of the temple flag) on Chathayam day, lasts for 10 days and ends on Thiruvathira nakshatra. Many temple art forms like 'Kadhakali', 'Ottamthullal', Paadakam', etc. are performed during the festival days. The most important vazhipaadu (offering) in the festival days is 'Ulsavabali'. On the last day of the festival called Aarattu, there is a fantastic ezhunnellippu (procession) with seven elephant accompanied by 'Panchavaadhyam' and 'Paandimelam'. Places of worship Kurumbakkavu Bhagavathi Temple, Poykkattussery * St. Antony's Church The Roman Catholic Church in the Name of St. Antony is another attraction in the place. Holy Feast of the Church is celebrated in the last week of January. The foundation stone of the church was laid in 1916. The congregation consists of 500 families. Every Tuesday evening 5.30 PM St: Antony's Novena is held at this Church and hundreds of people attend this worship and Novena. * Palaprassery Juma Masjid Palaprassery Juma Masjid which represents the Muslim community of western area is another landmark. The masjid situates 1 km away from Chengamanad Junction on the Parur road. * Chengamanad Mahadeva temple This Siva temple is one of the main attractions of the village * Panayakkadavu Muhiyadheen Juma Masjid The masjid situates half km away from Chengamanad Junction * Munikkal Guhalaya Temple The other center of attraction in Chengamand is the Munikkal temple. It is a small shrine dedicated to Load Subramanyan (son of Shiva). The temple is situated on a large rock resembling the back of an elephant. Munikkal Guhalayam Located atop a hill at Chengamanad (30 km north of Kochi), this is a place shrouded in mythology. It is believed that sage Jangaman had lived here around 2000 years ago, and me place was initially known as Jangaman, which later changed to chengamanad. A famous Lord Murugan temple is located on the spot where the sage is said to have meditated which was later consecrated by Chattambi Swamikal in 1898. The word \\"Munikkal Guhalayam\\" literally means \\"sages rock cave\\". Another story goes that Lord Murugan also called as \\"Guhalayam\\" had made this place as his abode and hence the word \\"Guhalavam\\"  Transport  Chengamanad is 10 km from Aluva Town by road on the Parur - Angamaly bus route.

Sylvania is located entirely within the bounds of the Ottawa National Forest, and is currently being managed as a wilderness area as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System by the U.S. Forest Service. Within its borders lie 34 lakes set against a backdrop of old-growth forests. It represents one of only a handful of such areas left in the Midwest.  History  Loon Lake Little is known of the area prior to the late 1800s, other than the area was frequently used by clans of Ojibwa Native Americans, as evidenced by the few scattered artifacts that have been found there. In 1895, a Wisconsin lumberman by the name of A.D. Johnston purchased of land at the south end of Clark Lake with the intent to cut the large pines located there. Upon seeing the land for himself, he was so taken by the rugged beauty of it that he changed his mind and decided to preserve it. He soon invited friends, many of whom were equally impressed and so moved to purchase adjacent lands, and after some time the Sylvania Club was formed, with fishing, hunting, and hiking being the main focus. The owners built lodges and cabins on the larger lakes, and the area became an exclusive resort for a small number of affluent and influential guests. Ownership changed hands over the years, and finally the entire area was purchased by the United States Forest Service in 1967, which promptly removed all buildings and began managing it as a special recreation area. In 1987, it was designated as a federal wilderness when the Michigan Wilderness Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by Ronald Reagan.  Sylvania facts  Sylvania straddles the divide between the Lake Superior and the Mississippi River drainage systems, occupying some of the highest ground in the Midwest. As an example, many of the lakes in the park are more than above sea-level. Due to this apex position, these deep, clear lakes are primarily landlocked, fed by springs and local run-off. There are no surface streams entering the park, which is one of the reasons the lakes remain pristine and pure. For this same reason, the lakes are a bit \\"fragile\\" (low flush rates, low nutrient loads, etc.). Special fishing regulations on these lakes, including catch and release for all bass, have helped to preserve the lakes' fisheries. The Sylvania Wilderness also features of hiking trails and portages within its . The old-growth northern hardwood forests in this wilderness are some of the most extensive in North America, nearly spanning the entire park at some . Sugar maple, eastern hemlock, and yellow birch are the most common trees, and are found along with white, red, and jack pine, white spruce, balsam fir, and paper birch. Wildlife abounds in the park, with white-tailed deer, black bear, grey wolves, porcupines, bobcat, beaver, otter, coyote, fox, bald eagle, loon, osprey, and many others. There are 84 designated campsites in 29 locations throughout the wilderness, each with rudimentary amenities such as outdoor toilets, tent pads, pack racks (for keeping foodstuffs out of reach of wildlife), and fire- grills.

Textile industry The people here are very talented in producing handmade fabrics, such as Bedspreads, Lungies, etc., but the problem is unemployment. Chennimalai handloom products are well known for their high quality and long life. It is the home for various handloom co- operative societies like: * Kalicoptex (employs more than 2000 people and produces designs products by the weavers of Kalikkavalasu) * Chenkumartex * Chencoptex (employs more than 2000 people) * Sri Fabrics Chennimalai Bedsheets * Ammatex * Chentex * P.K. Pudur Tex * Mayiltex * Metrotex * Kongutex * Kamarajtex * Gandhijitex * Chemmalartex These co-operative societies are the employers for thousands of weavers. For providing housing facilities to the handloom weavers, a colony of 1010 individual houses (considered to be one of the biggest weavers colonies in Asia) were built at the outskirts of Chennimalai City. Later, around 350 individual houses had been constructed for the weavers of Kalicoptex at three different locations around Chennimalai. Powerlooms also give plenty of employment opportunity to the people of Chennimalai. At any time, one can hear the noise of powerlooms operated in Chennimalai area. Hence, Chennimalai faces the problem of noise pollution and also air pollution due to dust from the looms. The fabric made here is of extremely high quality and hence preferred by North Indians during winter despite of the cost. Chennimalai Hill This temple is situated at about 400 meters above sea level, and this hill is noted for its natural flora and fauna. This hill also has rare medicinal herbs in its lush green forests. In Devanagiri this hill is called Siragiri and Chenniyangiri. In Tamil it is called Chennimalai. The city underneath the hill is also called Chennimalai. This hill is also called Sigaragiri, Pushpagiri and Siragiri. The Lord of mountains 'Kurinji Andavar', Murugan is highly praised and sung with reference to this abode in Kundruthor√¢dal. Chennimalai is one of them. The hill is home to hundreds of Peacocks, monkeys, rabbits, snakes and other reptiles. Recently, there were instances of people sighting spotted deers around Chennimalai. Flora includes trees like Neem, Banyan, Tamarind and variety of shrubs. Mountain of Sivanmalai is clearly visible from the top of the hill. It takes a 15 minutes drive to reach the hill temple by road and it gives a thrilling experience while travelling through the lush green forest with the steep slopes on the side. 1320 steps to climb up. The Temple of Lord Subramanya The temple of Lord Muruga is in Chennimalai. This temple of Lord Muruga is where Lord Arunagirinathar was blessed with \\"Padikasu\\", wealth of coins. This is where an unusual phenomenon, rather a miracle took place in the year 1984 on 12 February. A bullock cart with two bulls climbed the 1320 steps on their own on this eventful day. Saravana Munivar wrote the most popular Chennimalai Sthalapuranam before 700 years. Milk and curds are used as special offerings to Lord Muruga in Chennimalai and it is the general belief that curds do not become sour here. =Temple= The temple of Chennimalai is situated on the banks of Noyyal also called K√¢nchima Nadhi. The Sanctum Sanctorum faces the east. Just in front of the temple, one finds the Puliyadi Vin√¢yagar. Inside the temple to the right of Moolavar are the shrines of M√¢rkandeswarar and to the left Umayavalli. On the left side are the shrines of Kasi Viswan√¢thar and Vis√¢l√¢kshi. The steps behind Moolavar Sannidhi lead to the Valli Teyvannai Temple. The two consorts enshrined in a separate temple constitute a unique phenomenon. The Punn√¢kau Siddhar cave with the front yard filled with 'Vel' of different sizes and shapes is on top of the hill. This Siddhar is one of the popular 18 Siddhas known to the world for their Siddha yoga. Saravana M√¢munivar's tomb is near the cave. There is also another very ancient cave near this temple. The main deity Murugan is equated to the Sevvai graham or planet Mars and all the rest of the eight planets encircle the Lord in perfect harmony. If one circumambulates the main deity he is believed to get the benefit of circumambulating the navagrah√¢s and worshipping them. =Valli Teyvannai Temple= Farther up behind the temple is the Valli Teyvannai temple. They are in penance to attain Lord Muruga. They are known by the names Amirthavalli and Sundaravalli. A separate temple for Valli and Teyvannai is another unique feature of this temple. The observance of Shasti fast is also a special feature in this temple. Many devotees take this vow and spend 6 days fasting and praying at the temple premises. The monthly Shasti day after the new moon is also observed with great reverence. Particularly those devotees without progeny sincerely observe this Shasti fast and there are many instances of families coming traditionally on getting their vow fulfilled. Asking for the Lord's permission before taking up any task like building a new house or getting their children married or any other issue is customary in this temple. Devotees offer an Archnai and perform Sirasappu offering. If the reply is positive they whole-heartedly perform that action or event. Traditionally if the answer is negative the Devotees do not venture further. The holy water for Abishekam is being brought everyday by the temple bulls from the well located at Adivaram by crossing 1330 steps to reach the temple, which are being maintained by the Devasthanam. This procedure is also a unique one not found in other temples. A spring on the southern side of the hill temple is said to gush water once every twelve years during drought conditions. The Vin√¢yagar near the spring called Mam√¢nga Theertha Vin√¢yagar. The people worship this Vin√¢yagar and the holy springs with great Devotion. =Punnaku Siddhar Temple= There is a cave in the top of the hill where the Punnaku Siddhar has lived. Kanda Shasti Kavacham offering The popular daily prayer of Murugan Devotees, Kanda Shasti Kavacham was first offered to the world in this temple by Balan D√™var√¢ya Swamigal. From that day onwards till today many devotees keep chanting this prayer every day. Tuesday celebration In this temple, every Tuesday, all the devotees gather and pray to Lord Murugan. The 'Ratha oorvalam' is held every Tuesday evening. Car festival The car festival that comes in the Tamil month of 'Thai' attracts lakhs of devotees flooding the temple of Lord Muruga. The car starts from East Raja street, then through South Raja street, West Raja street and North Raja street again reaches East Raja Street. The town remains flooded by devotees for almost a week and many temporary shops occupy the road sides. Other important festivals are Chitra Pournami, Kanda sashti, Agni Nakshathram, Panguni Thaer, Chennimalai Mariamman festival, Ekkattampalayam Mariamman festival, and Murungathozhuvu Mariamman festival. During the second day of Pongal 'Poo Parikkum Thiruvizha' is celebrated as a part of Pongal celebrations and can see people going to the hills for plucking holy flowers, having food in the hills sharing with friends and relatives and performing 'Kummi' songs and dance which is unique to Kongu tradition and culture.

It is numbered as Child ballad 105, and as Roud number 483. Synopsis The ballad concerns a young squire's son who falls in love with a bailiff's daughter from Islington, to the north of London. This is considered to be an unsuitable pairing, so his family dispatches him to the City. There a seven- year apprenticeship affords him worldly success, although servitude sharpens his ardour for the maiden he once knew. The bailiff's family falls on hard times. The daughter survives, but is alone, and one day on a roadside encounters the well-beloved youth. She begs a penny. In reply, he asks: \\"I prithee, sweetheart, canst thou tell me / Where that thou wast born?\\"; and does she know of the bailiff's daughter of Islington? \\"She's dead, sir, long ago\\", the girl asserts sorrowfully. The youth is heartbroken and offhandedly pledges the girl his horse and tack, for he feels like nothing but departing into exile. She cries: \\"O stay, O stay, thou goodly youth! / She's alive, she is not dead; / Here she standeth by thy side, And is ready to be thy bride.\\"  First editions  The earliest known text was published (as a broadside) by Phillip Brooksby between 1683 and 1696. The tune dates from 1731 (ballad opera, The Jovial Crew). Recordings The song was recorded by such performers as Albert Beale, Tony Wales.

Such environments allow companies to realize a number of competitive advantages by using their existing computers and network infrastructure for group and personal collaboration. These fully featured environments combine the best features of web-based conferencing and collaboration, desktop videoconferencing, and instant message into a single easy-to-use, intuitive environment. Recent developments have allowed companies include streaming in real-time and archived modes into their ICE. Common applications found within ICE are: #Collaborative software designed to improve the performance of teams by supporting the sharing and flow of information. It allows for real-time collaboration and conferencing. #Workflow systems facilitate the automation and management of business processes. #Documentation management systems manage a document through all the stages of its processing. #Peer-to-peer collaboration software permits users to communicate in real time and share files without going through a central server. #Knowledge management systems are information technology (IT) systems that support the capture, organization, and distribution of knowledge (know-how). #Social network systems are IT systems that link people to others they know and, from there, to people their contacts know. It is a way to leverage personal and professional contacts. ICE allows organizations to take advantage of technological advances in computer processing power and video technology while maintaining backward compatibility with existing standards-based hardware conference equipment. ICE can reduce costs for a company. These benefits are achieved through cross discipline fertilization, which allows knowledge workers to share information across departments of a company, which can be important for ensuring that corporate goals are shared and fully integrated. There can be challenges to implementing ICE due to employees' lack of acceptance of knowledge management systems. Studies have shown that that lack of commitment and motivation by knowledge workers, professionals, and managers is the reason for problems, not the knowledge management technologies. Possible reasons for the lack of acceptance include: *People do not realize how important the knowledge they possess actually is and therefore do not submit it to the knowledge repository. *People believe that \\"knowledge is power\\" and are reluctant to share what they know with others. *People do not have time to submit information. Technology can help with this problem. By being closely tied to existing working practices, knowledge management applications transparently capture and store information in the repository.

Wattles Wallace Delois Wattles (; 1860‚Äì1911) was an American New Thought writer. He remains personally somewhat obscure,Butler-Bowdon, Tom (2004) 50 Success Classics, Nicholas Brealey Publishing, , p. 287. but his writing has been widely quoted and remains in print in the New Thought and self-help movements. Wattles' best known work is a 1910 book called The Science of Getting Rich in which he explains how to become wealthy. Life and career Wattles' daughter, Florence A. Wattles, described her father's life in a \\"Letter\\" that was published shortly after his death in the New Thought magazine Nautilus, edited by Elizabeth Towne. The Nautilus had previously carried articles by Wattles in almost every issue, and Towne was also his book publisher. Florence Wattles wrote that her father was born in the U.S. in 1860, received little formal education, and found himself excluded from the world of commerce and wealth. According to the 1880 US Federal Census,. Wallace lived with his parents on a farm in Nunda Township, McHenry County, Illinois, and worked as a farm laborer. His father is listed as a gardener and his mother as \\"keeping house\\". Wallace is listed as being born in Illinois while his parents are listed as born in New York. No other siblings are recorded as living with the family.. According to the 1910 census, Wattles had changed the spelling of his last name from Walters to Wattles. He was married to Abbie Walters, 47, at the time. They had three children: Florence Walters, 22, Russell H. Walters, 27, and Agnes Walters, 16. It also shows that at the time Wallace's mother Mary A. Walters was living with the family at the age of 79. Florence wrote that \\"he made lots of money, and had good health, except for his extreme frailty\\" in the last three years before his death. Wattles died on February 7, 1911 in Ruskin, Tennessee, and his body was transported home for burial to Elwood, Indiana.. As a sign of respect businesses closed throughout the town for two hours on the afternoon of his funeral. His death at age 51 was regarded as \\"untimely\\" by his daughter; in the previous year he had not only published two books (The Science of Being Well and The Science of Getting Rich), but he had also run for public office.. Christian Socialism In 1896 in Chicago, Illinois, Wattles attended \\"a convention of reformers\\" and met George Davis Herron,. a Congregational Church minister and professor of Applied Christianity at Grinnell College who was then attracting nationwide attention by preaching a form of Christian Socialism. After meeting Herron, Wattles became a social visionary and began to expound upon what Florence called \\"the wonderful, social message of Jesus.\\" According to Florence, he at one time had held a position in the Methodist Church, but was ejected for his \\"heresy\\". Two of his books (A New Christ and Jesus: The Man and His Work) dealt with Christianity from a Socialist perspective. In the 1908 election, he ran as a Socialist Party of America candidate in the Eighth Congressional District;. in 1910 he again ran as a Socialist candidate, for the office of Prosecuting Attorney for the Madison County, Indiana 50th court district. He did not win either election. Florence Wattles remained a Socialist after his death, and was a delegate to the Socialist Party National Committee in 1912 and 1915. New Thought As a Midwesterner, Wattles traveled to Chicago, where several leading New Thought leaders were located, among them Emma Curtis Hopkins and William Walker Atkinson, and he gave \\"Sunday night lectures\\" in Indiana; however, his primary publisher was Massachusetts-based Elizabeth Towne. He studied the writings of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Ralph Waldo Emerson,Sullivan, Dr. Gary (2007) A Christian Study of Wallace D. Wattle's Science of Getting Rich, Gold Stag Communications, , p. 31. and recommended the study of their books to his readers who wished to understand what he characterized as \\"the monistic theory of the cosmos.\\" Through his personal study and experimentation Wattles claimed to have discovered the truth of New Thought principles and put them into practice in his own life. He also advocated the then-popular health theories of \\"The Great Masticator\\" Horace Fletcher as well as the \\"No-Breakfast Plan\\" of Edward Hooker Dewey, which he claimed to have applied to his own life. He wrote books outlining these principles and practices, giving them titles that described their content, such as Health Through New Thought and Fasting and The Science of Being Great. His daughter Florence recalled that \\"he lived every page\\" of his books. A practical author, Wattles encouraged his readers to test his theories on themselves rather than take his word as an authority, and he claimed to have tested his methods on himself and others before publishing them. Wattles practiced the technique of creative visualization. In his daughter Florence's words, he \\"formed a mental picture\\" or visual image, and then \\"worked toward the realization of this vision\\": Influence Rhonda Byrne told a Newsweek interviewer that her inspiration for creating the 2006 hit film The Secret, and the subsequent book by the same name, was her exposure to Wattles's The Science of Getting Rich. Byrne's daughter, Hayley, had given her mother a copy of the Wattles book to help her recover from her breakdown. The film itself also references, by re-popularizing the term The Law of Attraction, a 1908 book by another New Thought author, William Walker Atkinson, titled Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World.

When released as a single the song was split across both sides, due to its length (7:27). As \\"Sky Pilot (Parts 1 & 2)\\" it reached number 14 on the U.S. pop charts and number 15 on the Canadian RPM chart. Themes \\"Sky pilot\\" refers to a military chaplain, as revealed by the opening verse: The chorus section adds: The song is a balladic slice of life story about a chaplain who blesses a body of troops just before they set out on an overnight raid or patrol, and then retires to await their return. \\"Sky Pilot\\" is organized into three movements: an introduction, a programmatic interlude, and a conclusion. The introduction begins with the verse quoted above, sung a cappella and solo by Eric Burdon. Thereafter the band joins in with instruments for the chorus. Several verse-chorus iterations follow, leaving the story with the \\"boys\\" gone to battle and the Sky Pilot retired to his bed. The verses are musically lean, dominated by the vocal and a pulsing bass guitar, with a strummed acoustic guitar and drum mixed in quietly. The interlude starts as a guitar solo, but the guitar is quickly submerged under a montage of battle sounds. First come the sounds of an airstrike; then the airstrike and rock band fade into the sounds of shouting, gunfire, and bagpipes. Near the end of the interlude the battle sounds fade, briefly leaving the bagpipes playing alone before the third movement begins. The bagpipe music is a performance by the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards playing \\"All The Blue Bonnets Are Over the Border\\". According to an unverified story, the pipers were recorded covertly by Burdon, resulting in the government of the United Kingdom sending the band a letter of complaint.Sky Pilot by The Animals Songfacts The conclusion begins with the return of the bass and strummed acoustic guitar, accompanied by strings. After a few measures the verses resume, but with a quieter, melancholy atmosphere: one verse is sung along with bass, guitar, and strings, and then without a choral break a final verse is sung to bass, guitar, and woodwinds. During those last verses, the \\"Soldiers of God\\" had done well defeating the enemies, for the aid of their country, however, the returning soldiers return, with tears in their eyes, having second thoughts about their mission. One of the returning soldiers feels more disturbed, with the smells of death, when he looks upon the Sky Pilot, remembering the commandment: \\"Thou shalt not kill\\". Finally a strong bass line announces the return of the chorus, now accompanied with strings, horns and piccolos, repeated several times as it fades. with the repeated section that the Sky pilot can never reach the sky, no matter how high he flies. The instrumental section is that of a military funeral march. The musical effect is very upbeat, in stark contrast with the \\"downer\\" content of the movement's lyrics. Special effects Besides the use of \\"found sound\\" in the interlude section, and heavy use of reverb and echos, the song is notable for its use of flanging, the swept \\"whooshing\\" sound effect laid over the entire track, most prominently during the chorus sections. In popular culture * Sky Pilot is played in Season 1 finale of the HBO series Eastbound & Down when Kenny asks Stevie to do one last job for him. * It is also featured in the motion picture Zodiac as well as on its soundtrack CD. Covers The song has been covered by several artists and is still played in live shows by Eric Burdon. It is included on several of Burdon's live albums and is featured in his 1999 concert film \\"Live at the Coachhouse\\". Burdon performed a somewhat-Power Metal version on his album \\"The Official Live Bootleg 2000\\". The song was covered by the Peruvian rock group Traffic Sound, in English in 1969. It was featured in full in their debut album, Vamos a Bailar Go Go, and the opening hymn also appeared as the introduction to one of the songs in their album Virgin . The song was covered by MacTalla Mor on their 2007 album Jacob's Ladder, in the song \\"Stairway to Grace\\". It was sampled by Sebadoh during a segue between the songs \\"Sexual Confusion\\" and \\"Three Times A Day\\" on their 1990 album, Weed Forestin'.

Description  The prairie earless lizard is an overall gray-brown in color, with rows of dark blotches on either side of the back, with a light colored stripe down the middle. The males have black and white diagonal markings just before their hind legs, which typically females lack. They grow from 4.5 to 6 inches in length, and like all earless lizards, they have no external ear openings. As their range overlaps with other subspecies of H. maculata, distinguishing them can be difficult.  Behavior  Like all earless lizards, the prairie earless lizard is diurnal and insectivorous. They are often seen basking themselves on rocks, but will flee quickly if approached.

River Ganga flows at the distance of 25 km from the town. Shallow lakes (Jhils) are commonly visible in Chhibramau tehsil, although many of them have been disappeared due to rapid urbanization of the town. History By the time of Akbar this city was the headquarters of a pargana. Early in the eighteenth century, Nawab Muhammad Khan of Farrukhabad founded a new quarter called Muhammadganj, with a fine sarai which was improved 100 years later by a British Collector. The town was administered under Act XX of 1856 during the British Raj, and prospered from its location on the grand trunk road. At present the great grand trunk road's stretch between Kanpur ‚Äì Kannauj ‚Äì Etah ‚Äì Delhi is called National Highway No. 91 (NH-91). Until 1997 Chhibramau was in Farrukhabad district, but since that district was divided the town has been within the new Kannauj district. =The \\"Chhibramau Disaster\\" and Hodson's Adventure= At the time of the 1857 uprising, old hostilities between the Raja of Mainpuri and the Nawab of Farrukhabad nearly led to open war, but after a face-off between their forces in Bewar in July, both forces joined hands against British rule. The Raja did not oppose a British armed unit led by Sir James Hope Grant when it marched through the district in October, but in December he heard that Brigadier Seaton was coming with a small force from Etah to join General Walpole at Mainpuri, and advanced to Kuraoli with the intention of barring the road. Seaton, however, easily outmaneuvered the local forces, and the rebels fled in disorder, losing eight guns and about a hundred men. It was after this action that the famous Hodson of Hodson's Horse in 1857-58 carried out one of his most daring exploits. Accompanied by his second-in-command, McDowell, and 75 men, he rode across a countryside swarming with rebels to carry despatches to the Commander-in-Chief, Sir Colin Campbell. He left most of his men at Bewar, but pushed on to Chhibramau with McDowell and 25 native men. There he learnt that Campbell was not at Gursahaiganj as expected, but at Miran ki Sarai, 15 miles further. The two officers rode on alone and reached Campbell's camp in safety, having ridden 55 miles in ten hours without changing horses. On their return the same evening they were warned by a native, to whom Hodson had given alms in the morning, that after their departure a party of 2,000 rebels had entered Chhibramau, killed the twenty-five troopers left there, and were now waiting for Hodson's return. Hodson and his companion nevertheless pressed on and, reaching the village, dismounted and passed quietly through it, unnoticed by the enemy. At Bewar they found a party sent by Seaton, who had heard of the disaster, and next day marched to Chhibramau himself, joining forces there with Brigadier Walpole on 3 January and proceeding with him to Fatehgarh. The civil authorities then reoccupied the district, and regained complete control late in 1858.History of Mainpuri, Uttar Pradesh, India.

These were formerly placed in the genus Saurothera (Greek for \\"lizard-eater\\") of the family Cuculidae, but are now lumped with Coccyzus (AOU 2006). The binomial name of the Puerto Rican lizard cuckoo species commemorates French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot. The Puerto Rican lizard cuckoo occurs in forests (common in the Gu√°nica, Guajataca and Vega State Forests and in the Caribbean National Forest) and coffee plantations throughout the island of Puerto Rico. The species can be observed slowly foraging the forest understory for lizards, its main dietary component (approximately 75%). Large spiders and insects are consumed to supplement its diet. Cuckoos are slender birds with long tails and long, thin, slightly curved bills. They move very slowly foraging for prey through the forest. Cuckoos do not swoop or circle in flight but generally fly in a direct line. Description The Puerto Rican lizard cuckoo has a gray breast and chin, a tan lower body and brown upper body. It can be identified by its gray chin and breast and reddish-tan underbelly. The main identifying characteristic for this species is its long dark tail with two white spots on its outer tail feathers. It measures from 40 to 48 centimeters (16 to 19 inches) and weighs, on average, 80 grams (2.7 ounces). Habits The Puerto Rican lizard cuckoo moves slowly through the vines and thickets of the middle story and upper canopy of the rain forest foraging for prey. Its favorite food source (and the bulk of its diet) is provided by the abundant lizard population in the forest. It also eats large spiders, beetles, stick bugs and caterpillars. The cuckoo often keeps its body still while it twists its neck at angles to strike its prey. This bird is often difficult to see because of its slow movement through the foliage, but after it rains it can sometimes be seen in the open drying- off and preening its feathers. Its song is a rapid ', not unlike the sound a Halloween witch makes. The cuckoo nest is a twig platform in a tree or large bush and usually contains up to 3 blue eggs. Habitat The Puerto Rican lizard cuckoo is endemic to (only found in) Puerto Rico. It is found in forest thickets, woodlands and coffee plantations throughout the island.http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gDfxMDT8MwRydLA1cj72DTUE8TAwgAykeaxRtBeY4WBv4eHmF- YT4GMHn8usNB9uHXDzYBB3A00PfzyM9N1S_IjTDIMnFUBADW0rdA/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfMjAwMDAwMDBBODBPSEhWTjJNMDAwMDAwMDA!/?navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid;=fsbdev3_043055&navid;=150130000000000&pnavid;=150000000000000&ss;=110819&position;=Not Yet Determined.Html&ttype;=detail&pname;=El Yunque National Forest- Nature  See also  * Fauna of Puerto Rico * List of birds of Puerto Rico * List of endemic fauna of Puerto Rico * List of Puerto Rican birds * List of Vieques birds * El Toro Wilderness References *Oberle, Mark W., 1999; Birds of Puerto Rico in Photographs, Editorial Humanitas, San Juan, Puerto Rico, 1st Edition. *Raffaele, Herbert W., 1989; A Guide to the Birds of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, USA  Puerto Rican lizard cuckoo Endemic birds of Puerto Rico Puerto Rican lizard cuckoo Puerto Rican lizard cuckoo ","title":"Puerto Rican lizard cuckoo"},{"id":"5712314","text":"Chhotaputki is a neighbourhood in Dhanbad in Dhanbad Sadar subdivision of Dhanbad district in Jharkhand state, India.

It made its first printed appearance in The Customs of London, published in 1502 by the chronicler Richard Arnold. Synopsis A man and woman talk of women's fidelity, he disbelieving, and she producing the nut-brown maid as proof. They discuss her story. Her love comes to her, a knight but banished. She tells him that she loves him alone. He tells her that he must go to the greenwood, and she says that it grieves her. He asks if she would not find time easing her and urges her to let it, and she declares that she would go with him to the woods. He warns her that men will slander her for it, that she will have to take a bow as if a man, that if he is caught and executed, no one will help her, that the way will be hard, in the wild and exposed to weather, that meals will be scarce and beds non-existent, that she will have to disguise herself as a man, that he believes she will give it up quickly, that being a baron's daughter and he a lowly squire, she will come to curse him for this, and that he might fall in love with another woman, but to each one, she retorts that she will still come, because she loves him alone. He tells her that he is not, after all, banished, and she says she is glad but knows that men are fickle. The man assures her that he will marry her, and that he is, in fact, an Earl's son. Legacy Matthew Prior's 1709 poem Henry and Emma is based on \\"The Nut- Brown Maid\\". Ursula March is referred to several times, in Dinah Mulock Craik's John Halifax, Gentleman (1856), as the \\"Nut-browne Mayde,\\" highlighting her status as a faithful woman who marries beneath her station. Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961). B.B‚Äôs 1944 novel ‚ÄòBrendon Chase‚Äô opens with an excerpt from the ballad.

Bach. It consists of 4 movements, and is intended to be humorous to listen to. The players are instructed to play the piece sloppily, especially the fourth movement. The whole piece is about 10-11 minutes long. It was released on the album Music for an Awful Lot of Winds and Percussion.  Movements  *Grand Entrance: A short movement with repeated lines by the whole band. The music is very simple to play. *Simply Grand Minuet: Features some parts of the band playing with their mouthpieces only, to create a duck call effect. The lead trombonist plays a high part while the rest of the section plays a very low note, and a piccolo duet is featured as melody. At the end of the piece, the clarinet section takes water and gurgles a B-flat note. *Romance in the Grand Manner: The melody of this piece is actually Old Folks at Home at a slower tempo. *Rondo Mucho Grando: The final and longest movement of the four; it features a Crasho Grosso. This is where the percussionists are instructed to drop and tip over their instruments while making it appear to be an accident. The melody is very simple, accompanied by an upward scale. There are many references to other musical snippets, including a trombone playing a blues scale and the trumpet section playing the fanfare before a race begins. One quoted tune is \\"You Gotta Be a Football Hero,\\" which is immediately turned into the opening theme of Beethoven's String Quartet No. 7. A siren then announces the end of the piece.

He was first seated by Congress in 1890 after it found in his favor in relation to the contested 1888 election in Maryland's 5th congressional district, which was marked by fraud and intimidation. Early life and education Born into the planter class at the family plantation, Gallant Green, in Charles County, Maryland, Mudd was reared Catholic and first educated locally. He attended Georgetown University and graduated from St. John's College of Annapolis, Maryland in 1878. He \\"read the law\\" as an apprentice with an established firm and also attended the law department of the University of Virginia at Charlottesville. He was admitted to the bar in 1880 and returned to Charles County to begin his practice. Marriage and family Mrs Sydney Emanuel Mudd I Mudd married a daughter of Walter Griffin of Surrattsville (now part of Clinton, Maryland). Among their children was Sydney Emanuel Mudd II, who became an attorney and politician like his father. The son was elected to several terms as a Congressman from Maryland's 5th district beginning in 1914, after his father's death. Career Mudd was elected a member of the Maryland House of Delegates in 1879 and 1881. As a Republican candidate, he challenged and successfully contested the 1888 election of Barnes Compton as US Representative from the 5th district to the Fifty-first Congress. At a time when many Maryland elections were surrounded by violence and fraud as Democrats sought to re-establish white supremacy, Mudd filed charges of election fraud. He claimed that election officials had turned away qualified voters and that, in Anne Arundel County, Democrats posing as US Marshals intimidated blacks, forcing them from the polls. The House Committee on Elections investigated and decided in his favor. Congress awarded the seat to Mudd in 1889, and he served in the next session, from March 20, 1890, to March 3, 1891. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1890 to the Fifty-second Congress, defeated by Compton. In 1895 Mudd was elected again to the state House of Delegates, where he served as Speaker of the House. He moved to rural La Plata, Maryland in 1896. He served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention the same year. In 1896 Mudd benefitted by the coattails of a winning Republican biracial coalition that gained the governorship.STEPHEN TUCK, \\"Democratization and the Disfranchisement of African Americans in the US South during the Late 19th Century\\" (pdf), Spring 2013, reading for \\"Challenges of Democratization\\", by Brandon Kendhammer, Ohio University He was elected from the 5th district to the Fifty-fifth and to the six succeeding Congresses, serving from March 4, 1897 to March 3, 1911. (His chief Democratic rival in the district, Barnes Compton, died in 1898.) In Congress, Mudd served as chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of Justice (Sixtieth and Sixty-first Congresses). Mudd died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was interred in St. Ignatius‚Äô Catholic Church Cemetery at Chapel Point near La Plata.\\"Mudd, Sydney Emanuel \\", Maryland Biographical Dictionary, p. 388 His son, Sydney Emanuel Mudd II, was also elected as a Republican US Congressman from Maryland's fifth district.

Young Robinson served his country, also, in the War of 1812 when he was stationed at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, as an Adjutant. At the war's end, he left the Army and settled in Boston where he entered into commercial business until his retirement about 1847. He served in the state legislature for a year, although he never entered into active politics, and as a civil magistrate. It was following his retirement that he moved to Lexington on Elm Street (now Harrington Road), where he lived until his death on October 16, 1868. He was married, twice, and survived by his widow, two sons and two daughters. Simon W. Robinson was raised to the Third Degree of Freemasonry on January 20, 1820, in Mount Lebanon Lodge, Boston. He served the Lodge as Master in 1824 and 1845 and was Lodge Treasurer from 1828 to 1843. He served the Grand Lodge of Masons in Massachusetts as Junior Grand Warden, 1837; Senior Grand Warden, 1838 through 1840, and Deputy Grand Master, 1841 through 1843. He was elected Grand Master of all Masons in Massachusetts in 1846 and served for three years. In the York Rite of Freemasonry, he was exalted in St. Paul's Royal Arch Chapter in 1821, serving as High Priest (1825-26) and Grand High Priest of the Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Massachusetts (1837-39). He was greeted in Boston Council, Royal and Select Masters, in 1828 and served as Principal Conductor of the Work in 1840. He was knighted in Boston Encampment (now Commandery) in 1835 and a charter member of DeMolay Commandery in 1848, serving as Grand Commander of the Grand Encampment (Commandery) of Massachusetts and Rhode Island (1854 -55). In Scottish Rite Freemasonry, he received the Fourth Degree to the Sixteenth Degrees in 1842 in Boston Grand Council of Princes of Jerusalem. Minutes of the Scottish Rite Supreme Council, Northern Masonic Jurisdiction, note the issuance of a dispensation to confer the Thirtieth to Thirty-second Degrees on then Grand Master Simon W. Robinson. He was elevated to the Thirty-third Degree on August 25, 1851. In September 1851 he was appointed Grand Treasurer General by Grand Commander Edward Asa Raymond, a position he held until 1860. This was an interesting period in Scottish Rite Masonic history. There were several bodies at various times in the mid-nineteenth century purporting to be authorized Supreme Councils and conferring versions of the degrees. For the details of this era, we look to other histories. Of interest here, is the fact that the elected and acknowledged Sovereign Grand Commander of the Northern Jurisdiction Supreme Council, Edward A. Raymond, in August, 1860, as a result of a disagreement over his authority, left the Supreme Council, in session, and in December, 1860, formed a new Supreme Council. Simon W. Robinson left the Northern Supreme Council with his friend and associate, Raymond, and assisted in establishing the new body which he served as Grand Treasurer General (1860-61) and Lieutenant Grand Commander (1861-63). The Raymond Council merged with the Hays-Cerneau Council, becoming known as the Hays-Raymond Council, which Robinson served as 1st Lieutenant Commander (1863-65) and Sovereign Grand Commander (1865-66) until the voluntary dissolution of that body. He attempted briefly to revive the Raymond Council in December 1866, until resigning command, as a lost cause, in May 1867. In the Union of 1867, his status as an active member of the Northern Supreme Council was reinstated. He died at his Lexington residence on October 16, 1868. Interment was at Mount Auburn Cemetery. A Freemason's Lodge, Simon W Robinson Lodge, AF&AM;, was dedicated to him in 1870 in the town of Lexington, Massachusetts in the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts. That Lodge continues to meet in Lexington, and as of the 2018-2019 Masonic year is the seventh largest Masonic Lodge in Massachusetts. 1792 births 1868 deaths People from New Hampton, New Hampshire People of New Hampshire in the American Revolution American Freemasons ","title":"Simon W.

Hamburg 1931 is one of the largest atolls on earth. It is sometimes referred to as Lord Howe Atoll, not to be confused with Lord Howe Island. Geographically it belongs to a scattered group of three atolls which includes nearby Nukumanu Atoll and the wholly submerged Roncador Reef located to the south.Remote Atolls and Offshore Islands of PNG and the Solomons Description Administratively Ontong Java belongs to the Solomon Islands. As an outlying part of Malaita Province, it forms the northernmost tract of land of this state, over north of Santa Isabel Island. The closest land, however, is Nukumanu Atoll, which lies only due north of Ontong Java's northern tip and, though historically closely related to Ontong Java, is now under the administration of Papua New Guinea. Ontong Java is roughly boot-shaped. The entire size of the atoll is , but there are only of land, spread out over 122 small islands. The islands are mostly low- lying coral formations, the highest elevation being . Approximately 2000 people live on the atoll. There are two main villages where the population is concentrated with 1,386 on the island of Luaniua in the eastern end and 689 on Pelau in the northeast. History Nautical Chart of Ontong Java Atoll, 1934 The islands were first inhabited by Polynesians approximately 2000 years ago. The main cultural and commercial exchanges took place with the inhabitants of neighboring Nukumanu Atoll, with whom Ontong Java people share many cultural affinities.Sarfert, Ernst, and Hans Damm. \\"Luangiua und Nukumanu.\\" Ergebnisse der S√ºdsee Expedition, 1908-1910.

The following verifiable sighting by Europeans was by Abel Tasman in 1643 who named it Ontong Java; however, it wasn't until 1791 that Europeans set foot on the islands, when Capt. John Hunter (later Governor of New South Wales) named it Lord Howe Atoll. In 1893 the islands were annexed by Germany and ceded to Great Britain in 1899. Today the atoll's inhabitants make a subsistence living by means of coconut and taro (root) cultivation, as well as fishing. Until a ban in 2005, the primary source of income was beche de mer and trochus shells, which were shipped to Hong Kong. The inhabitants are also involved in copra production. It also has a prolific number of sea birds, including the black-naped tern, which uses Ontong Java Atoll as a breeding site. Anthropology and linguistics Large general cemetery, Luaniua, Ontong Java.

Brown described the population as PolynesianGeorge Brown, Melanesians and Polynesians, p. 414, and referred to the place as Lua Niua. He recorded the existence of a two-class system in Ontong Java and, based on it, inferred that it was probable that exogamous classes formerly existed in Samoa as well.Introduction to the History of Religions - Handbooks on the History of Religions, Volume IV, Crawford Howell Toy The first detailed research on Ontong Java's inhabitants, however, was conducted by German ethnographers Ernst Sarfert and Hans Damm, during a German scientific expedition of the Southern Seas that took place in 1908-1910. This expedition visited both Ontong Java and neighboring Nukumanu Atoll, where they also carried out their research. Their work, \\"Luangiua und Nukumanu\\" was published in 1931.

Worldwide, a variety of cheeses are marketed under the Castello name, including semi soft cheeses, semi hard cheeses, blue cheeses, and cream cheeses. For the market of Europe, Castello markets soft ripened cheeses called Golden and White; Organic Brie; semi hard cheeses Herrg√•rd and Pr√§st; blue cheeses Black, Creamy Blue, Danablu, Danablu Gold, Organic Blue, Organic Mild; and a line of cream cheeses. For the market of North America, Castello markets a camembert, a brie, and several varieties of blue cheese, named Noble Blue Cheese, Extra Danish Creamy Blue (also available sliced), Soft Blue, and Crumbled Blue Cheese. In 2012, the Denmark's Finest Havarti Cheeses were added to the Castello brand, followed by Saga Blue Brie in 2013. The Alps Selection Cheeses; Hirten, Bergkase, and Weissbier, were launched in the United States in the end of 2012, and were the first of their kind available in the United States. In some markets, the name Blue Castello is used for a triple-cream blue cow's milk cheese.  History  Castello was established in 1893 by Rasmus Tholstrup of Denmark. His son, Henrik, bought a Swedish dairy and produced the popular Bianco cheese, followed by the Castello cheese, a white cheese that was developed over ten years before its debut. In 1958, Henrik expanded the cheese brand, with the purchase of several dairies in Denmark. After four years, the number of Castello cheeses produced per day had increased to 2,200. Thirty years later, 60,000 Castello cheeses were being produced every day. In 1963, Henrik received the Danish Cheesemonger‚Äôs award, having made ‚ÄúA tremendous effort by introducing the new Castello cheese, which has made Danish cheese production highly successful and in a few years has gained remarkable popularity both in Denmark and abroad.‚Äù Castello was acquired by Arla Foods, who expanded Castello into cheese markets in North America.  Blue cheese production  Castello blue cheeses were developed in the 1960s. The curds are dipped into salt water, drained, and put into molds. The cheese is punctured with tiny holes and then brought into the ripening room, where it stays for about 15 days. It is then washed, cut, packed, and put in a \\"cooling room\\" for about a week at a temperature close to freezing. The washed rind hosts various molds that add to the cheese's mildly spicy flavor. It has a smooth, rich texture much like Brie.

PGK is a major enzyme used in glycolysis, in the first ATP-generating step of the glycolytic pathway. In gluconeogenesis, the reaction catalyzed by PGK proceeds in the opposite direction, generating ADP and 1,3-BPG. In humans, two isozymes of PGK have been so far identified, PGK1 and PGK2. The isozymes have 87-88% identical amino acid sequence identity and though they are structurally and functionally similar, they have different localizations: PGK2, encoded by an autosomal gene, is unique to meiotic and postmeiotic spermatogenic cells, while PGK1, encoded on the X-chromosome, is ubiquitously expressed in all cells. Biological function Diagram showing glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways. Note that phosphoglycerate kinase is used in both directions. PGK is present in all living organisms as one of the two ATP-generating enzymes in glycolysis. In the gluconeogenic pathway, PGK catalyzes the reverse reaction. Under biochemical standard conditions, the glycolytic direction is favored. In the Calvin cycle in photosynthetic organisms, PGK catalyzes the phosphorylation of 3-PG, producing 1,3-BPG and ADP, as part of the reactions that regenerate ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. PGK has been reported to exhibit thiol reductase activity on plasmin, leading to angiostatin formation, which inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth. The enzyme was also shown to participate in DNA replication and repair in mammal cell nuclei. The human isozyme PGK2, which is only expressed during spermatogenesis, was shown to be essential for sperm function in mice. =Interactive pathway map=  Structure =Overview= PGK is found in all living organisms and its sequence has been highly conserved throughout evolution. The enzyme exists as a 415-residue monomer containing two nearly equal-sized domains that correspond to the N- and C-termini of the protein. 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) binds to the N-terminal, while the nucleotide substrates, MgATP or MgADP, bind to the C-terminal domain of the enzyme. This extended two-domain structure is associated with large-scale 'hinge-bending' conformational changes, similar to those found in hexokinase. The two domains of the protein are separated by a cleft and linked by two alpha-helices. At the core of each domain is a 6-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by alpha helices. The two lobes are capable of folding independently, consistent with the presence of intermediates on the folding pathway with a single domain folded. Though the binding of either substrate triggers a conformational change, only through the binding of both substrates does domain closure occur, leading to the transfer of the phosphate group. The enzyme has a tendency to exist in the open conformation with short periods of closure and catalysis, which allow for rapid diffusion of substrate and products through the binding sites; the open conformation of PGK is more conformationally stable due to the exposure of a hydrophobic region of the protein upon domain closure. =Role of magnesium= Magnesium ions are normally complexed to the phosphate groups the nucleotide substrates of PGK. It is known that in the absence of magnesium, no enzyme activity occurs. The bivalent metal assists the enzyme ligands in shielding the bound phosphate group's negative charges, allowing the nucleophilic attack to occur; this charge-stabilization is a typical characteristic of phosphotransfer reaction. It is theorized that the ion may also encourage domain closure when PGK has bound both substrates.  Mechanism  Phosphoglycerate kinase mechanism in glycolysis. Without either substrate bound, PGK exists in an \\"open\\" conformation. After both the triose and nucleotide substrates are bound to the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively, an extensive hinge-bending motion occurs, bringing the domains and their bound substrates into close proximity and leading to a \\"closed\\" conformation. Then, in the case of the forward glycolytic reaction, the beta- phosphate of ADP initiates a nucleophilic attack on the 1-phosphate of 1,3-BPG. The Lys219 on the enzyme guides the phosphate group to the substrate. PGK proceeds through a charge-stabilized transition state that is favored over the arrangement of the bound substrate in the closed enzyme because in the transition state, all three phosphate oxygens are stabilized by ligands, as opposed to only two stabilized oxygens in the initial bound state. In the glycolytic pathway, 1,3-BPG is the phosphate donor and has a high phosphoryl- transfer potential. The PGK-catalyzed transfer of the phosphate group from 1,3-BPG to ADP to yield ATP can power the carbon-oxidation reaction of the previous glycolytic step (converting glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 3-phosphoglycerate).  Regulation  The enzyme is activated by low concentrations of various multivalent anions, such as pyrophosphate, sulfate, phosphate, and citrate. High concentrations of MgATP and 3-PG activates PGK, while Mg2+ at high concentrations non-competitively inhibits the enzyme. PGK exhibits a wide specificity toward nucleotide substrates. Its activity is inhibited by salicylates, which appear to mimic the enzyme's nucleotide substrate. Macromolecular crowding has been shown to increase PGK activity in both computer simulations and in vitro environments simulating a cell interior; as a result of crowding, the enzyme becomes more enzymatically active and more compact.  Disease relevance  Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) deficiency is an X-linked recessive trait associated with hemolytic anemia, mental disorders and myopathy in humans, depending on form ‚Äì there exists a hemolytic form and a myopathic form.NIH Genetics Home Reference Since the trait is X-linked, it is usually fully expressed in males, who have one X chromosome; affected females are typically asymptomatic. The condition results from mutations in Pgk1, the gene encoding PGK1, and twenty mutations have been identified. On a molecular level, the mutation in Pgk1 impairs the thermal stability and inhibits the catalytic activity of the enzyme. PGK is the only enzyme in the immediate glycolytic pathway encoded by an X-linked gene. In the case of hemolytic anemia, PGK deficiency occurs in the erythrocytes. Currently, no definitive treatment exists for PGK deficiency. PGK1 overexpression has been associated with gastric cancer and has been found to increase the invasiveness of gastric cancer cells in vitro. The enzyme is secreted by tumor cells and participates in the angiogenic process, leading to the release of angiostatin and the inhibition of tumor blood vessel growth. Due to its wide specificity towards nucleotide substrates, PGK is known to participate in the phosphorylation and activation of HIV antiretroviral drugs, which are nucleotide-based.

It had been known as Dryandra sessilis until 2007, when the genus Dryandra was sunk into Banksia. The Noongar peoples know the plant as budjan or butyak. Widespread throughout southwest Western Australia, it is found on sandy soils over laterite or limestone, often as an understorey plant in open forest, woodland or shrubland. Encountered as a shrub or small tree up to in height, it has prickly dark green leaves and dome-shaped cream-yellow flowerheads. Flowering from winter through to late spring, it provides a key source of food‚Äîboth the nectar and the insects it attracts‚Äîfor honeyeaters in the cooler months, and species diversity is reduced in areas where there is little or no parrot bush occurring. Several species of honeyeater, some species of native bee, and the European honey bee seek out and consume the nectar, while the long-billed black cockatoo and Australian ringneck eat the seed. The life cycle of Banksia sessilis is adapted to regular bushfires. Killed by fire and regenerating by seed afterwards, each shrub generally produces many flowerheads and a massive amount of seed. It can recolonise disturbed areas, and may grow in thickets. Banksia sessilis has a somewhat complicated taxonomic history. It was collected from King George Sound in 1801 and described by Robert Brown in 1810 as Dryandra floribunda, a name by which it was known for many years. However, Joseph Knight had published the name Josephia sessilis in 1809, which had precedence due to its earlier date, and the specific name was formalised in 1924. Four varieties are recognised. It is a prickly plant with little apparent horticultural potential; none of the varieties are commonly seen in cultivation. A profuse producer of nectar, B. sessilis is valuable to the beekeeping industry. Description Banksia sessilis grows as an upright shrub or small tree up to high, without a lignotuber. In most varieties, new stems are covered in soft, fine hairs that are lost with maturity; but new stems of B. sessilis var. flabellifolia are usually hairless. Leaves are blue- green or dark green. Their shape differs by variety: in var. cygnorum and var. flabellifolia they are wedge-shaped, with teeth only near the apex; in var. cordata they are wedge-shaped, but with teeth along the entire margin; and in var. sessilis they are somewhat broader at the base, sometimes almost oblong in shape. Leaf size ranges from in length, and in width. They may be sessile (that is, growing directly from the stem without a petiole) or on a petiole up to long. The inflorescences are cream or yellow, and occur in domed heads wide, situated at the end of a stem. Each head contains from 55 to 125 individual flowers, surrounded at the base by a whorl of short involucral bracts. As with most other Proteaceae, individual flowers consist of a tubular perianth made up of four united tepals, and one long wiry style. The style end is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but breaks free at anthesis. In B. sessilis the perianth is straight, long, and pale yellow. The style is slightly shorter, also straight, and cream-coloured. Thus in B. sessilis, unlike many other Banksia species, the release of the style at anthesis does not result in a showy flower colour change. One field study found that anthesis took place over four days, with the outer flowers opening first and moving inwards. Flowering mostly takes place from July to November; var. sessilis can start as early as May. After flowering, the flower parts wither and fall away, and up to four follicles develop in the receptacle (the base of the flower head). Young follicles are covered in a fine fur, but this is lost as they mature. Mature follicles are ovoid in shape, and measure in length. Most follicles open as soon as they are ripe, revealing their contents: a woody seed separator and up to two winged seeds. Discovery and naming alt=Old painting of segment of plant with leaves and blooms on white background with several anatomical cross sections of flower parts beneath Specimens of B. sessilis were first collected by Scottish surgeon Archibald Menzies during the visit of the Vancouver Expedition to King George Sound in September and October 1791. No firm location or collection date can be ascribed to Menzies' specimens, as their labels simply read \\"New Holland, King Georges Sound, Mr. Arch. Menzies\\", and Menzies' journal indicates that he collected over a wide area, visiting a different location every day from 29 September to 8October. In addition to B. sessilis, Menzies collected plant material of B. pellaeifolia, and seeds of at least four more Banksia species. This was therefore an important early collection for the genus, only seven species of which had previously been collected. Menzies' seed specimens were sent to England from Sydney in 1793, but his plant material remained with him for the duration of the voyage, during which some material was lost. On his return to England in 1795, the surviving specimens were deposited into the herbarium of Sir Joseph Banks, where they lay undescribed for many years. The next collection was made in December 1801, when King George Sound was visited by HMS Investigator under the command of Matthew Flinders. On board were botanist Robert Brown, botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer, and gardener Peter Good. All three men gathered material for Brown's specimen collection, including specimens of B. sessilis, but neither Brown's nor Good's diary can be used to assign a precise location or date for their discovery of the species. Good also made a separate seed collection, which included B. sessilis, and the species was drawn by Bauer. Like nearly all of his field drawings of Proteaceae, Bauer's original field sketch of B. sessilis was destroyed in a Hofburg fire in 1945. A painting based on the drawing survives, however, at the Natural History Museum in London. On returning to England in 1805, Brown began preparing an account of his Australian plant specimens. In September 1808, with Brown's account still far from finished, Swedish botanist Jonas Dryander asked him to prepare a separate paper on the Proteaceae so he could use the genera erected by Brown in a new edition of Hortus Kewensis. Brown immediately began a study of the Proteaceae, and in January 1809 he read to the Linnean Society of London a monograph on the family entitled On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. Among the eighteen new genera presented was one that Brown named Josephia in honour of Banks. Brown's paper was approved for printing in May 1809, but did not appear in print until March the following year. In the meantime, Joseph Knight published On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, which appeared to draw heavily on Brown's unpublished material, without permission, and in most cases without attribution. It contained the first publication of Brown's Josephia, for which two species were listed. The first, Josephia sessilis, was based on one of Menzies' specimens: \\"This species, discovered by Mr. A. Menzies on the West coast of New Holland, is not unlike some varieties of Ilex aquifolium, and now in his Majesty's collection at Kew.\\" The etymology of the specific epithet was not explicitly stated, but it is universally accepted that it comes from the Latin sessilis (sessile, stalkless), in reference to the sessile leaves of this species. Blame for the alleged plagiarism largely fell on Richard Salisbury, who had been present at Brown's readings and is thought to have provided much of the material for Knight's book. Salisbury was ostracized by the botanical community, which undertook to ignore his work as much as possible. By the time Brown's monograph appeared in print, Brown had exchanged the generic name Josephia for Dryandra, giving the name Dryandra floribunda to Knight's Josephia sessilis. As there were then no firm rules pertaining to priority of publication, Brown's name was accepted, and remained the current name for over a century. In 1813, Curtis's Botanical Magazine featured a colour plate of a painting by alt=Old plate of segment of plant with leaves and blooms on parchment-coloured background Another significant early collection was the apparent discovery of the species at the Swan River in 1827. In that year, the colonial botanist of New South Wales Charles Fraser visited the area as part of an exploring expedition under James Stirling. Among the plants Fraser found growing on the south side of the river entrance was \\"a beautiful species of Dryandra\\", which was probably this species. Over the course of the 19th century, the principle of priority in naming gradually came to be accepted by botanists, as did the need for a mechanism by which names in current usage could be conserved against archaic or obscure prior names. By the 1920s, Dryandra R.Br. was effectively conserved against Josephia Knight; a mechanism for formal conservation was put in place in 1933. Brown's specific name, however, was not conserved, and Karel Domin overturned Dryandra floribunda R.Br. by transferring Knight's name into Dryandra as Dryandra sessilis (Knight) Domin in 1924. This name was current until 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred into Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele. The full citation for the current name is thus Banksia sessilis (Knight) A.R.Mast & K.R.Thiele. =Common names= The first common names for this species were literal translations of the scientific names. When published as Josephia sessilis in 1809, it was given the common name sessile Josephia. Brown did not offer a common name when he published Dryandra floribunda in 1810, but later that year the Hortus Kewensis translated it as many flowered dryandra. This name was also used when the plant was featured in Curtis's Botanical Magazine in 1813. In Australia, the names prickly banksia and shaving-brush flower were offered up by Emily Pelloe in 1921, the latter because \\"when in bud the flower very much resembles a shaving-brush\\". Shaving- brush flower was still in use as late as the 1950s. The name holly-leaved dryandra was used when the plant was featured as part of a series of articles in the Western Mail of 1933‚Äì34, and this was taken up by William Blackall in 1954, and was still in use as late as 1970. Meanwhile, Gardner used the name parrot bush in 1959, a name derived from the observation that the blooms attract parrots, by which the species was already \\"well-known to bee-keepers\\". This name was widely adopted, and since 1970 has been in almost exclusive usage. The only indigenous names reported for the plant are Budjan and But- yak. These were published by Ian Abbott in his 1983 Aboriginal Names for Plant Species in South-western Australia, with Abbott suggesting that the latter name should be preferred, but with the orthography \\"Pudjak\\". However, Abbott sources these names to George Fletcher Moore's 1842 A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language of the Aborigines, which in fact attributes these names to the species Dryandra fraseri (now Banksia fraseri). It is unclear whether Abbott has corrected Moore's error, or introduced an error of his own. Taxonomy =Infrageneric placement= Brown's 1810 monograph did not include an infrageneric classification of Dryandra, and neither did his Prodromus, published later that year. In 1830, however, he introduced the first taxonomic arrangement of Dryandra, placing D. floribunda in section Dryandra verae along with most other species, because its follicles contain a single seed separator. Dryandra verae was renamed Eudryandra by Carl Meissner in 1845. Eleven years later Meissner published a new arrangement, retaining D. floribunda in D. sect. Eudryandra, and further placing it in the unranked subgroup ¬ß Ilicinae, because of the similarity of its leaves to those of Ilex (holly). In 1870, George Bentham published a revised arrangement in his Flora Australiensis. Bentham retained section Eudryandra, but abandoned almost all of Meissner's unranked groups, including ¬ß Ilicinae. D. floribunda was instead placed in D. ser. Floribundae along with four other species with small, mostly terminal flowers, left exposed by their having unusually short floral leaves. Bentham's arrangement stood for over a hundred years, eventually replaced in 1996 by the arrangement of Alex George. Section Eudryandra was promoted to subgenus rank, but replaced by the autonym D. subg. Dryandra. D. sessilis, as this species was now called, was retained in D. ser. Floribundae, but alone, as the series was redefined as containing only those taxa that apparently lack floral bracts altogether. The placement of D. sessilis in George's arrangement, with 1999 and 2005 amendments, may be summarised as follows: :Dryandra (now Banksia ser. Dryandra) ::D. subg. Dryandra :::D. ser. Floribundae ::::D. sessilis (now B. sessilis) :::::D. sessilis var. sessilis (now B. sessilis var. sessilis) :::::D. sessilis var. flabellifolia (now B. sessilis var. flabellifolia) :::::D. sessilis var. cordata (now B. sessilis var. cordata) :::::D. sessilis var. cygnorum (now B. sessilis var. cygnorum) :::D. ser. Armatae :::D. ser. Marginatae :::D. ser. Folliculosae :::D. ser. Acrodontae :::D. ser. Capitellatae :::D. ser. Ilicinae :::D. ser. Dryandra :::D. ser. Foliosae :::D. ser. Decurrentes :::D. ser. Tenuifoliae :::D. ser. Runcinatae :::D. ser. Triangulares :::D. ser. Aphragma :::D. ser. Ionthocarpae :::D. ser. Inusitatae :::D. ser. Subulatae :::D. ser. Gymnocephalae :::D. ser. Plumosae :::D. ser. Concinnae :::D. ser. Obvallatae :::D. ser. Pectinatae :::D. ser. Acuminatae :::D. ser. Niveae ::D. subg. Hemiclidia ::D. subg. Diplophragma George's arrangement remained current until 2007, when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia. They also published B. subg. Spathulatae for the Banksia taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons, thus redefining B. subg. Banksia as comprising those that do not. They were not ready, however, to tender an infrageneric arrangement encompassing Dryandra, so as an interim measure they transferred Dryandra into Banksia at series rank. This minimised the nomenclatural disruption of the transfer, but also caused George's rich infrageneric arrangement to be set aside. Thus under the interim arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele, B. sessilis is placed in B. subg. Banksia, ser. Dryandra. =Varieties= habit: a small upright shrubalt=A green, upright shrub in a field with yellow grass, with other green plants in the background Four varieties are recognised: * B. sessilis var. sessilis is an autonym that encompasses the type material of the species. This is the most widespread variety, occurring from Regans Ford and Moora in the north, south-east to Albany, and inland as far as Wongan Hills, Pingelly and Kulin. Its blue-green leaves are cuneate (wedge-shaped) or oblong, and are usually two to three centimetres long but may reach five. * B. sessilis var. cordata was published as Dryandra floribunda var. cordata by Carl Meissner in 1848. In 1870, George Bentham published D. floribunda var. major, but this is now considered a taxonomic synonym of B. sessilis var. cordata. It has larger inflorescences than var. sessilis, as well as larger dark green, rather than blue green leaves. It is found in the state's far southwest, between Capes Leeuwin and Naturaliste, and east to Walpole, and grows on sandy soils over limestone. * B. sessilis var. cygnorum has its roots in Michel Gandoger's publication of two new species names in 1919. He published Dryandra cygnorum and Dryandra quinquedentata, but in 1996 both of these were found to refer to the same taxon, which Alex George gave variety rank as Dryandra sessilis var. cygnorum. The term cygnorum is Latin for \\"swan\\" and relates to the Swan River, which runs past the suburb of Melville where the type material was collected. It has smaller dark green leaves only long and wide, whose teeth are limited to the distal part of the leaf. The range is along the Western Australian coastline from Dongara southwards past Fremantle, and east to Lake Indoon and Kings Park. * B. sessilis var. flabellifolia was published by George in 1996, the type specimen having been collected northwest of Northampton in 1993. The northernmost of the four varieties, it is found from Kalbarri south to Geraldton and Northampton. There are some scattered records further south towards Moora. Its specific name is derived from the Latin flabellum \\"fan\\" and folium \\"leaf\\". Its leaves are fan shaped, with a long, toothless lower margin, and a toothed end. Its stems are hairless, unlike the other varieties. Distribution and habitat alt=A map of the biogeographic regions of Western Australia, showing the range of Banksia sessilis. It occupies the southwestern corner of Australia. Banksia sessilis is endemic to the Southwest Botanical Province, a floristic province renowned as a biodiversity hotspot, located in the southwest corner of Western Australia. This area has a Mediterranean climate, with wet winters and hot, dry summers. B. sessilis occurs throughout much of the province, ranging from Kalbarri in the north, south to Cape Leeuwin, east along the south coast as far as Bremer Bay, and inland to Wongan Hills and Kulin. It thus spans a wide range of climates, occurring in all but the semi-arid areas well inland. It is also absent from the Karri forest in the cool, wet, southwest corner of the province, but even there, B. sessilis var. cordata occurs along the coast. The species tolerates a range of soils, requiring only that its soil be well-drained. Like most dryandras, it grows well in lateritic soils and gravels; this species is also found in deep sand, sand over laterite, and sand over limestone. It also occurs in a range of vegetation complexes, including coastal and kwongan heath, tall shrubland, woodland and open forest. It is a common understorey plant in drier areas of Jarrah forest, and forms thickets on limestone soils of the Swan Coastal Plain. Banksia sessilis sets a large amount of seed and is an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open areas; for example, it has been recorded colonising gravel pits in the Darling Scarp. Nothing is known of the conditions that affect its distribution, as its biogeography is as yet unstudied. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is likely to contract by half in the face of severe change, but unlikely to change much under less severe scenarios. Ecology =As food= The nectar of B. sessilis is an important component of the diet of several species of honeyeater. In one study, B. sessilis was found to be the main source of nectar for all six species studied, namely the tawny-crowned honeyeater (Gliciphila melanops), white-cheeked honeyeater (Phylidonyris niger), western spinebill (Acanthorhynchus superciliosus), brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta), brown-headed honeyeater (Melithreptus brevirostris), and black honeyeater (Certhionyx niger). Moreover, B. sessilis played an important role in their distributions, with species that feed only on nectar occurring only where B. sessilis occurs, and remaining for longest at sites where B. sessilis is most abundant. Other honeyeaters that have been recorded feeding on B. sessilis include the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), western wattlebird (A. lunulata), and New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae). Furthermore, a study of bird species diversity in wandoo woodland around Bakers Hill found that honeyeater species and numbers were much reduced in forest that lacked a Banksia sessilis understory; the plant is a key source of nectar and insects during the winter months. A field study in jarrah forest 9 km south of Jarrahdale, where B. sessilis grows in scattered clumps, found that western wattlebirds and New Holland honeyeaters sought out groups of plants with the greatest numbers of new inflorescences, particularly those one or two days after anthesis, where nectar yield was highest. The birds likely recognises these by visual clues. Banksia sessilis is also a source of food for the Australian ringneck (Barnardius zonarius), and the long-billed black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus baudinii), which tear open the follicles and consume the seeds. The introduced European honey bee (Apis mellifera) has also been observed feeding on B. sessilis, as have seven species of native bee, comprising four species of Hylaeus (including the banksia bee H. alcyoneus), two of Leioproctus, and a Lasioglossum. =Life cycle= Honeyeaters are clearly the most important pollination vector, as inflorescences from which honeyeaters are excluded generally do not set any fruit. Moreover, honeyeaters have been observed moving from tree to tree with significant loads of B. sessilis pollen on their foreheads, beaks and throats, having acquired it by brushing against pollen presenters while foraging for nectar; experiments have shown that some of this pollen may be subsequently deposited on stigmas during later foraging. The flowers of B. sessilis have adaptations that encourage outcrossing. Firstly, they are protandrous: a flower's pollen is released around 72 hours before it becomes itself receptive to pollen, by which time around half of its pollen has lost its viability. Secondly, the period of maximum nectar production closely matches the period during which the flower is sexually active, so honeyeaters are enticed to visit at the most opportune time for pollination. This has proven an effective strategy: almost all pollen is removed within two to three hours of presentation. In addition, honeyeaters tend to move between inflorescences on different plants, rather than between inflorescences on the same plant, at least in high density sites. These factors combine to make it fairly unusual for a flower to be fertilised by its own pollen. When self- fertilisation does occur, whether autogamous or geitonogamous, the resulting seed is almost always aborted, and the species ultimately achieves an outcrossing rate of nearly 100%, at least in high density sites. Limited data for low-density sites, where honeyeaters move from plant to plant less frequently, suggest more of a mixed-mating system. alt=Side view of a bug, with green underside and brown back, inside an open follicle The species is a prolific flowerer, and this, combined with the very high outcrossing rates, results in massive seed output. In one study, the average number of seeds produced per B. sessilis plant was 622, compared with an average of two for B. dallanneyi. This exceptionally high fecundity can be understood as an adaption to regular bushfire. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark; reseeders are killed by fire, but populations are rapidly re- established through the recruitment of seedlings. B. sessilis is a reseeder, but it differs from many other reseeders in not being strongly serotinous: the vast majority of seeds are released spontaneously in autumn, even in the absence of fire. The degree of serotiny is a matter of some contradiction in the scientific literature: it has been treated as \\"serotinous\\", \\"weakly serotinous\\" and \\"non-serotinous\\". Regardless of the terminology used, the massive spontaneous seed output of B. sessilis is its primary survival strategy, and is so effective the species has a reputation as an excellent coloniser. However, this strategy, together with its relatively long juvenile period, makes it vulnerable to overly frequent fire. Seeds of B. sessilis are short-lived, and must germinate in the winter following their release, or they die. They are also very sensitive to heating, and thus killed by bushfire; in one study, just 30 seconds in boiling water reduced the germination rate from 85% to 22%, and not a single seed survived one minute of boiling. Like most other Proteaceae, B. sessilis has compound cluster roots, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These exude a range of carboxylates, including citrate, malonate and trans-aconitate, that act as acid phosphatase, allowing the absorption of nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. =Disease= Banksia sessilis is highly susceptible to dieback caused by the introduced plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soil-borne water mould that causes root rot; in fact it is so reliably susceptible it is considered a good indicator species for the presence of the disease. Most highly susceptible species quickly become locally extinct in infected areas, and in the absence of hosts the disease itself eventually dies out. However, B. sessilis, being an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open ground, often colonises old disease sites. The new colonies are themselves infected, and thus P. cinnamomi survives at these sites indefinitely. The application of phosphite inhibits growth of P. cinnamomi in B. sessilis, but does not kill the pathogen. In one study, a foliar spray containing phosphite inhibited the growth of P. cinnamomi by over 90% in plants infected with B. sessilis two weeks after spraying, and by 66% in plants infected one year after spraying; yet most plants infected shortly before or after spraying were dead 100 days later, while nearly all plants infected seven months later spraying survived a further 100 days. Phosphite is not known to affect plant growth, but has been shown to reduce pollen fertility: one study recorded fertility reductions of up to 50%, and, in a separate experiment, fertility reductions that persisted for more than a year. Infection of coastal stands of B. sessilis by the fungus Armillaria luteobubalina has also been recorded. The apparent infection rate of 0.31 is quite slow compared to the progress of other Armillaria species through pine plantations. Cultivation =History= It is not known whether the seed collection sent to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, by Menzies in 1793 included seeds of B. sessilis, but if it did then it did not germinate. The species was successfully germinated, however, from Good's seed, which was sent from Sydney on 6June 1802 and arrived at Kew the following year. According to Brown's notes it was flowering at Kew by May 1806, and in 1810 it was reported in the second edition of Hortus Kewensis as flowering \\"most part of the Year\\". In 1813 a flowering specimen from the nursery of Malcolm and Sweet was featured as Plate 1581 in Curtis's Botanical Magazine. alt=Painting of segment of plant showing inflorescences in bud and full flower By the 1830s the species was in cultivation in continental Europe. It was recorded as being cultivated in the garden of Karl von H√ºgel in Vienna, Austria in 1831, and in 1833 it was listed amongst the rare plants that had been introduced into Belgium. Along with several hundred other native Australian plants it was exhibited at plant shows held at Utrecht and Haarlem in the Netherlands in the 1840s and 1850s. By this time, however, English gardeners had already begun to lose interest in the Proteaceae, and by the end of the 19th century European interest in the cultivation of Proteaceae was virtually non-existent. In Australia, there was little interest in the cultivation of Australian plants until the mid-20th century, despite a long-standing appreciation of their beauty as wildflowers. For example, in 1933 and 1934 The Western Mail published a series of Edgar Dell paintings of Western Australian wildflowers, including a painting of B. sessilis. These were subsequently republished in Charles Gardner's 1935 West Australian Wild Flowers. One of the first published colour photographs of the species appeared in William Blackall's 1954 How to know Western Australian wildflowers, but this publication was restricted to plant identification. The species was discussed and illustrated in the 1959 Wildflowers of Western Australia, and in the 1973 Flowers and plants of Western Australia, but these books did not provide cultivation advice either. Possibly the first published information on the cultivation of Dryandra appeared in the magazine Australian Plants in June and September 1961. D. sessilis was among the species treated, but as there was not yet any experimental data on cultivation, information was restricted to its aesthetic qualities and the soil in which it naturally occurs. From its inception in 1962, the Kings Park and Botanic Garden undertook extensive research into the cultivation of native plants, resulting in two early publications that mentioned the cultivation potential of B. sessilis. In 1965, John Stanley Beard published Descriptive catalogue of Western Australian plants, \\"a work of reference in which the horticultural characteristics of the plants concerned could be looked up by the staff\\", which described D. sessilis as an erect shrub with pale yellow flowers appearing from May to October, growing in sand and gravel. Five years later, Arthur Fairall published West Australian native plants in cultivation. This presented largely the same information as Beard's catalogue, adding only that the species flowers well in its third season. =Current knowledge= According to current knowledge, B. sessilis is an extremely hardy plant that grows in a range of soils and aspects, so long as it is given good drainage, and tolerates both drought and moderate frost. Unlike many dryandras, it grows well on limestone (alkaline) soils. It flowers very heavily and is an excellent producer of honey. It attracts birds, and is also popular with beekeepers. However, its size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens, and if given an ideal situation it may produce a great many seedlings. It is propagated only from seed, as propagating it from cuttings has proven virtually impossible. Germination takes about five or six weeks, and plants may take two years to flower.

It was first published as a series of articles in the newspaper El Sol in 1929, and as a book in 1930; the English translation, first published two years later, was authorized by Ortega. While the published version notes that the translator asked to remain anonymous, more recent editions also record that its US copyright was renewed in 1960 by a Teresa Carey, and the US Copyright Office's published list of US copyright renewals for January 1960 gives the translator as J. R. Carey. A second translation was published in 1985 by the University of Notre Dame Press in association with W. W. Norton & Co. This translation was completed by Anthony Kerrigan (translator) and Kenneth Moore (editor). An introduction was written by novelist Saul Bellow.  Summary  In this work, Ortega traces the genesis of the \\"mass-man\\" and analyzes his constitution, en route to describing the rise to power and action of the masses in society. Ortega is throughout quite critical of both the masses and the mass-men of which they are made up, contrasting \\"noble life and common life\\" and excoriating the barbarism and primitivism he sees in the mass-man. He does not, however, refer to specific social classes, as has been so commonly misunderstood in the English-speaking world. Ortega states that the mass-man could be from any social background, but his specific target is the bourgeois educated man, the se√±orito satisfecho (satisfied young man, or Mr. Satisfied), the specialist who believes he has it all and extends the command he has of his subject to others, contemptuous of his ignorance in all of them. Ortega's summary of what he attempted in the book exemplifies this quite well, while simultaneously providing the author's own views on his work: \\"In this essay an attempt has been made to sketch a certain type of European, mainly by analyzing his behaviour as regards the very civilization into which he was born\\". This had to be done because that individual \\"does not represent a new civilisation struggling with a previous one, but a mere negation ...\\" Notable quotes See also *Ortega hypothesis *Technocracy *Mass culture References * Pedro Blas Gonzalez.

Heme peroxidases catalyse the H2O2-dependent oxidation of a wide range of different, usually organic, substrates in biology. Structure of ascorbate peroxidase in complex with ascorbate (in blue); a histidine ligand (in red) coordinates to the iron of the heme group (also in red). Image taken from PDB 1OAF and created using Pymol Overview Ascorbate-dependent peroxidase activity was first reported in 1979,, more than 150 years after the first observation of peroxidase activity in horseradish plantsPlanche, LA. (1810) Bull. Pharm., 2, 578 and almost 40 years after the discovery of the closely related cytochrome c peroxidase enzyme. Peroxidases have been classified into three types (class I, class II and class III): ascorbate peroxidases is a class I peroxidase enzyme. APXs catalyse the H2O2-dependent oxidation of ascorbate in plants, algae and certain cyanobacteria. APX has high sequence identity to cytochrome c peroxidase, which is also a class I peroxidase enzyme. Under physiological conditions, the immediate product of the reaction, the monodehydroascorbate radical, is reduced back to ascorbate by a monodehydroascorbate reductase (monodehydroascorbate reductase (NADH)) enzyme. In the absence of a reductase, two monodehydroascorbate radicals disproportionate rapidly to dehydroascorbic acid and ascorbate. APX is an integral component of the glutathione-ascorbate cycle. Substrate specificity APX enzymes show high specificity for ascorbate as an electron donor, but most APXs will also oxidise other organic substrates that are more characteristic of the class III peroxidases (such as horseradish peroxidase), in some cases at rates comparable to that of ascorbate itself. This means that defining an enzyme as an APX is not straightforward, but is usually applied when the specific activity for ascorbate is higher than that for other substrates. Mechanism Most of the information on mechanism comes from work on the pea cytosolic and soybean cytosolic enzymes. The mechanism of oxidation of ascorbate is achieved by means of an oxidized Compound I intermediate, which is subsequently reduced by substrate in two, sequential single electron transfer steps (equations [1]‚Äì[3], where HS = substrate and S‚Ä¢ = one electron oxidised form of substrate). :APX + H2O2 ‚Üí Compound I + H2O [1] :Compound I + HS ‚Üí Compound II + S‚Ä¢ [2] :Compound II + HS ‚Üí APX + S‚Ä¢ \\\\+ H2O [3] In ascorbate peroxidase, Compound I is a transient (green) species and contains a high- valent iron species (known as ferryl heme, FeIV) and a porphyrin pi-cation radical,, as found in horseradish peroxidase. Compound II contains only the ferryl heme. Structural information The structure of pea cytosolic APX was reported in 1995. The binding interaction of soybean cytosolic APX with its physiological substrate, ascorbate, and with a number of other substrates are also known. Applications in cellular imaging Both pea APX and soybean APX have been used in electron microscopy studies for cellular imaging.

It is a Subdivision of the district. Chikodi, Athani, Hukkeri, Raybag, Nipani and Kagwad are the taluks that come under Chikodi Subdivision. It is 75 kilometers from the city of Belgaum, 65 kilometers from Kolhapur, 51 kilometers from Miraj, 160 kilometers from Hubballi, and 570 kilometers from the capital of Karnataka state, Bengaluru. Chikodi has many district level offices but it is not designated as a district by the Government of Karnataka. It is one of the major cities that lies in the border between Karnataka and Maharashtra states. History Around 200‚Äì300 years ago, Chikkodi was called as Chik-kodi (small village), while the nearby Hirekudi (big village) was bigger than Chikodi. Over time, Chikodi experienced growth due to its famous betel leaves and its position on major roads. Chikodi has always had strong religious ties for Jains, Hindus, Christians and Muslims. It enjoys rich cultural diversity stemming from its proximity to the state of Maharashtra. Kannada is the main language that is spoken though Marathi is spoken seldom too. The customs and traditions of Chikodi have been influenced by both the Kannadiga and Maratha cultures.  Geography  Chikodi is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Chikodi It has an average elevation of 683 meters (2240 feet). The town has an area of 18.29 km2, and is situated amidst hills. The topography within 2 kilometers of Chikodi contains significant variations in elevation as it is surrounded by range of hills, with a maximum elevation change of 169 meters and an average elevation above sea level of 657 meters. The Krishna river, which has water almost throughout the year, is the chief source of agricultural and drinking water for local people living in the surrounding villages. The other river system of the taluka consists of Vedganga, Dudhaganga and Panchganga. Ground water resources are also extensively tapped in foothills which are easily accessible to borewells, canals and creeks around. Nestling among the hillocks and sylvan surroundings, it is indeed an ideal place for trails and easy to moderate hikes. There's a famous telephone tower atop Chandrakori Hills which renders mesmerizing views of the city. Chikodi taluka is generally divided into two zones on the basis of terrain. The Northern part consists of the deep and good black soil on the bank of the rivers flowing from west to east, therefore it is a very fertile tract. While the southern hilly area land consists of red clay soil, having comparatively less fertile. Of course, there are small patches of coarse land in northern part and good fertile land in the southern part of the taluka.  Climate  Chikodi has a tropical savanna climate. The wet season is pleasant, windy, and overcast while the dry season is hot and partly cloudy. The dry season lasts for 2.5 months, from 9 March to 23 May, with an average daily high temperature above 34¬∞C. Chikodi receives rainfall from both the northeast and the southwest monsoons and the wettest months are June‚ÄìSeptember. The rainy period of the year lasts for 6.1 months, from 14 May to 18 November, with a sliding 31-day rainfall of at least 13 millimeters. The most rain falls during the 31 days centered around 18 July, with an average total accumulation of 239 millimeters. Over the course of the year, the temperature typically varies from 14¬∞C to 37¬∞C and is rarely below 13¬∞C or above 39¬∞C. December & January are generally cold as compared to the rest of year. The coldest month is January with an average low temperature of 14 ¬∞C and the hottest month is April with an average high temperature of 35.7 ¬∞C. Winter temperatures rarely drop below 13 ¬∞C (55.4 ¬∞F), and summer temperatures seldom exceed 38 ¬∞C.  Demographics  India census, Chikodi had a population of 38,307. Males constitute 51% of the population and females 49%. The average literacy rate is 73%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; with male literacy at 79% and female literacy at 66%. Business Chikodi is mostly dependent on agriculture. Sugarcane occupies an important place in the economy of Chikodi which has three sugar factories, Doodhaganga Krishna Sugar Factory which is the nearest, Venkateshwara Power Project Ltd. Bedkihal, and Om Sugars Ltd. Jainapur among others. Tobacco farming is another major agricultural sector. Major production of tobacco comes from Galatga, Shiragaonwadi, Tapakarwadi, and Khadaklat villages. Recently the trend of Sericulture is picking up.  Renewable power projects at Chikodi  Wind turbines near Chikodi = Wind power project = The project activity is a cleaner means for power generation which avoids fossil fuel based thermal power generation. It is an energy diversification measure where wind energy which is a renewable energy, is harnessed for generation of power in order to suffice the increasing energy demand in the villages around Chikodi. It will help to improve the availability of electricity as the electricity generated will be fed into the grid thereby curtailing the supply demand gap. The generated electricity is supplied to the Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL) which distributes it as per the state policy. The land prices in the neighboring area have gone up thereby benefiting the villagers. Total nominal power expected is around 18 MW. A range of wind farms can be seen around a radius of 5 km from the city. Wind farms generate clean renewable electricity without any greenhouse gas emissions or waste byproducts thus mitigating climate change. This electricity displaces electricity generation in fossil fuel dominated grid resulting in savings of coal. Itnal Solar PV Plant, Chikodi = Solar power plant = A solar photovoltaic (PV) power plant in Itnal, Chikodi, was set up in the year 2009 by Karnataka Power Corporation Limited. The installed capacity of plant is 3 MW. There are totally 13,104 modules of each 250 MW rating in an area of 17 acres.

It is also the name of the elevated plateau between the Dachstein range and the Enns valley on which this municipality is located. The appendage am Dachstein is added to distinguish the municipality from others of the same name existing in Austria. It is usually omitted in common speech. Geography Ramsau am Dachstain is situated between the Dachstein range of mountains in the north and the Enns valley in the south. While the Dachstein range contains peaks up to 2,995 m (9,826 ft) and the towns of the Enns valley, such as Schladming, lie at around 700 m (2,300 ft) above sea level, the Ramsau plateau is a comparatively level piece of land at an elevation of around 1,100 m (3,600 ft). Towards the north, some hills at the foot of the mountain range rise up to 1,700 m (5,600 ft). At approximately 75 km¬≤ (29 sq mi), the plateau is an exceptional geological feature in the rugged terrain of the Alps which is more usually characterized by high mountain ranges and narrow valleys. The municipality of Ramsau am Dachstein is made up of several smaller towns, namely Leiten, R√∂ssing, Ramsau, Schildlehen, Vorberg and Hirzegg. Owing to their position on a plateau, the settlements are more spread out than in a typical Alpine valley. The overall population of the municipality was recorded as 2,701 in the 2001 census. History The name Ramsau was first recorded as Ramsowe in a document dated to around 1120 AD. Important landowners during the feudal period and beyond were the abbeys of Admont and St. Peter's. After the events of the Reformation and the Counter- reformation of the 16th century, the relatively secluded Ramsau emerged as one of the few thoroughly Protestant communities in Austria; something which it remains to this day. As early as the 15th century, the area established a tradition in the manufacture of loden, a thick cloth used in the traditional dress of the wider region. With the advent of commercial tourism in the late 19th century the area gained another steady source of income. Tourism and sports Due to its exceptional geography of relatively flat terrain at a high elevation, the Ramsau plateau has developed as a major center for cross- country skiing. Owing to the historically close connection of cross-country skiing and ski jumping (cf. Nordic sports), several ski jumps were erected in the region in the 20th century. The excellence of the Nordic venues of Ramsau am Dachstein was recognized by FIS when it awarded the region the 1999 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships. There are also several smaller lifts for Alpine skiing along the hills on the north side of the plateau. In addition, Ramsau hosts the base station of the cable car leading up to the Dachstein glacier. On top of the Dachstein, there is a year-round resort for Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, and snowboarding.

It is responsible for the catalytic synthesis of 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. BPGM also has a mutase and a phosphatase function, but these are much less active, in contrast to its glycolitic cousin, phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM), which favors these two functions, but can also catalyze the synthesis of 2,3-BPG to a lesser extent.  Tissue distribution  Because the main function of bisphosphoglycerate mutase is the synthesis of 2,3-BPG, this enzyme is found only in erythrocytes and placental cells. In glycolysis, converting 1,3-BPG to 2,3-BPG would be very inefficient, as it just adds another unnecessary step. Since the main role of 2,3-BPG is to shift the equilibrium of hemoglobin toward the deoxy-state, its production is really only useful in the cells which contain hemoglobin- erythrocytes and placental cells.  Function  1,3-BPG is formed as an intermediate in glycolysis. BPGM then takes this and converts it to 2,3-BPG, which serves an important function in oxygen transport. 2,3-BPG binds with high affinity to Hemoglobin, causing a conformational change that results in the release of oxygen. Local tissues can then pick up the free oxygen. This is also important in the placenta, where fetal and maternal blood come within such close proximity. With the placenta producing 2,3-BPG, a large amount of oxygen is released from nearby maternal hemoglobin, which can then dissociate and bind with fetal hemoglobin, which has a much lower affinity for 2,3-BPG.  Structure  = Overall = BPGM is a dimer composed of two identical protein subunits, each with its own active site. Each subunit consists six Œ≤-strands, Œ≤ A-F, and ten Œ±-helices, Œ± 1-10. Dimerization occurs along the faces of Œ≤ C and Œ± 3 of both monomers. BPGM is roughly 50% identical to its PGM counterpart, with the main active-site residues conserved in nearly all PGMs and BPGMs. = Important residues = * His11: the nucleophile of the 1,2-BPG to 1,3-BPG reaction. Rotates back and forth with the help of His-188 to get in an in-line position in order to attack the 1‚Äô phosphate group. * His-188: involved in overall stability of protein, as well as hydrogen bonding to substrate, as His-11, which it pulls into its catalytic position. * Arg90: although not involved directly in binding, this positively charged residue is essential to overall stability of the protein. Can be substituted with Lysine with little effect on catalysis. * Cys23: has little effect on overall structure, but large effect on reactivity of the enzyme.  Mechanism of catalysis  1,3-BPG binds to the active site, which causes a conformational change, in which the cleft around the active site closes in on the substrate, securely locking it in place. 1,3-BPG forms a large number of hydrogen bonds to the surrounding residues, many which are positively charged, severely restricting its mobility. Its rigidity suggests a very enthalpically driven association. Conformational changes cause His11 to rotate, partially aided by hydrogen bonding to His188. His11 is brought in‚Äìline with the phosphate group, and then goes through an SN2 mechanism in which His11 is the nucleophile that attacks the phosphate group. The 2‚Äô hydroxy group then attacks the phosphate and removes it from His11, thereby creating 2,3-BPG.

Geography  Chinchinim is located at . It has an elevation of . It lies on the banks of the River Sal.  History  Chapel of Our Lady of Sorrows in Palmar Grande, Chinchinim The name 'Chinchinim' is derived from 'Chinchinath', the local deity, from one of the four temples present in Chinchinim. These temples are said to be destroyed by the Portuguese in AD 1567. The other view is that the temples simply disappeared as the devotees converted to Christianity. Holy Cross in Sucaldem, Chinchinim A church dedicated to St Anne was built in AD 1590 by the Jesuits. It was built by contributions from the Communidade of the village and the neighbouring villages. The church was burnt during the Muslim invasions, and the present Our Lady of Hope church was built in AD 1627, which was also burnt during the Maratha invasion in AD 1739. The repairs were done in the following years. Chinchinim also houses the Chapel of St Sebastian, frequented by people of all religions for the last century. At the beginning of the twentieth century, there was a great plague in Goa, killing many in Chinchinim. A local doctor named Dr Miguel de Loiola Furtado or simply Dotor Minglu worked tirelessly to save as many lives as he could, but then, the flu hit the village, and his works seemed to be all in vain. At that time, he along with the Vicar of the church, got the Lumanaria started in homage to St Sebastian, where on each day, one group of Chinchinim residents would take the image of St Sebastian to their homes and accompany it back to the church square with great pomp and reverence. The flu cleared out, and many people were saved, while Dotor Minglu died in the epidemic, ironically, while he was the leader fighting it. After his death, the Lumanirias continued, however, of the days kept for each group of Chinchinim residents, now segregated by wards, one day was reserved for the family and relatives of Dotor Minglu. Dotor Minglu is also known for his daughter and oldest son, who were Goa's fearless writers, who haunted both the Portuguese rulers and the anti-Portuguese. Their works related to Goa and how Goa laid at the centre of the Portuguese Empire. His son Mario de Loiola Furtado carried a newspaper column Manual de Rua which means 'Street guide' which awoke and enlightened many a Goan. He made Goans realise that they were not ruled by the Portuguese, but they ruled Portugal. Their votes counted in deciding who ruled Portugal and in Portugal's and the colonies' destiny. His daughter Leonor, or Lulita as she was known, took journalism to new levels as far as Goans and women are concerned, with the family publication, India Purtuguesa. His second son Dr Alvaro de Loiola Furtado , as the last president of the Partido Indiano and as the brains behind Dr Jack de Sequeira in the United Goans Party, was instrumental in assuring Goa's identity, at a time when a few Goans tried to get Goa merged into neighbouring Maharashtra. It is also the birthplace of Lord Querobino Rodrigues. In the game of football, Chinchinim has produced some of India's greatest sons.  Demographics  It has a predominant Christian population and is dotted with typically Goan mansions and small cottages which are colourful and incorporate all the typical features of a Goan village life. Chinchinim had a population of 6 908 of which 3 263 are males while 3 645 are females as per the 2011 India census.

It provides services throughout the Research Triangle and North Carolina. UNC Health was created in 1998, when the North Carolina General Assembly passed legislation that established the UNC Health Care System, bringing under one entity UNC Hospitals and the clinical programs of the UNC School of Medicine. In 2018, the system reported over 3.5 million outpatient visits and over 500,000 emergency visits. History The first hospital in what later became known as UNC Hospitals and the UNC Health Care System was North Carolina Memorial Hospital, which opened on Sept. 2, 1952. Then in 1989, the North Carolina General Assembly created the University of North Carolina Hospitals entity as a unifying organization to govern constituent hospitals. Today, UNC Health consists of UNC Medical Center, Rex Healthcare, Chatham Hospital, Caldwell Memorial Hospital, Johnston Health, Pardee Hospital, Nash Health Care, Wayne Memorial Hospital, UNC Lenoir Health Care and UNC Rockingham Health Care. In addition, UNC Health Care includes UNC Faculty Physicians (the practice group serving UNC Hospitals) and the UNC Physicians Network (a wholly owned subsidiary of UNC Health that owns and operates community-based practices that provide primary and specialty care throughout the North Carolina Triangle area.). UNC Hospitals include the NC Memorial Hospital, NC Children's Hospital, NC Women's Hospital, NC Cancer Hospital (clinical home of the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center), and the NC Neurosciences Hospital. Construction of a new $20 million office/hospital complex in Hillsborough, NC began in April 2011. As of July 2015, many services are now offered at the Hillsborough campus, including an emergency department and general surgery. UNC Health and Charlotte-based Atrium Health announced August 31, 2017 that the systems had signed a letter of intent (LOI) to join their clinical enterprises and collaborate to enhance medical education and research. Under the LOI, the two organizations agreed to start a period of exclusive negotiations, with the goal of entering into final agreements by the end of the year. Their goal is to form a new organization through a joint operating company structure. Executives of both systems said a larger network would improve the ability to negotiate with insurance companies and provide other cost reductions. The letter of intent signed August 30, 2017 said that if the proposed partnership was approved, UNC Health Care CEO Bill Roper would become executive chairman and Carolinas Healthcare CEO Gene Woods would be CEO of the new organization. However, questions about who would control the combined system led Atrium to back out of talks in March 2018. On October 25, 2017, Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center and High Point Regional Health System announced that Wake Forest Baptist would take over High Point Regional, a part of UNC Health since 2013, by Summer 2018.

The suspected catalytically essential histidine residue involved in forming the phosphohistidine complex is directly to the left of the bound citrate molecule. :This enzyme is not to be confused with Bisphosphoglycerate mutase which catalyzes the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM) is any enzyme that catalyzes step 8 of glycolysis. They catalyze the internal transfer of a phosphate group from C-3 to C-2 which results in the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) to 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG) through a 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate intermediate. These enzymes are categorized into the two distinct classes of either cofactor-dependent (dPGM) or cofactor- independent (iPGM). The dPGM enzyme () is composed of approximately 250 amino acids and is found in all vertebrates as well as in some invertebrates, fungi, and bacteria. The iPGM () class is found in all plants and algae as well as in some invertebrate, fungi, and Gram-positive bacteria. This class of PGM enzyme shares the same superfamily as alkaline phosphatase. Mechanism PGM is an isomerase enzyme, effectively transferring a phosphate group (PO43‚àí) from the C-3 carbon of 3-phosphoglycerate to the C-2 carbon forming 2-phosphoglycerate. There are a total of three reactions dPGM can catalyze: a mutase reaction resulting in the conversion of 3PG to 2PG and vice versa, a phosphatase reaction creating phosphoglycerate from 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, and a synthase reaction producing 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate similar to the enzyme bisphosphoglycerate mutase. Kinetic and structural studies have provided evidence that indicate dPGM and bisphosphoglycerate mutase are paralogous structures. Both enzymes are contained in the superfamily that also contains the phosphatase portion of phosphofructokinase 2 and prostatic acid phosphatase. The catalyzed mutase reaction involves two separate phosphoryl groups and the ending phosphate on the 2-carbon is not the same phosphate removed from the 3-carbon. In the cofactor-dependent enzyme's initial state, the active site contains a phosphohistidine complex formed by phosphorylation of a specific histidine residue. When 3-phosphoglycerate enters the active site, the phosphohistidine complex is positioned as to facilitate transfer of phosphate from enzyme to substrate C-2 creating a 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate intermediate. Dephosphorylation of the enzyme histidine actuates a local allosteric change in enzyme configuration which now aligns the substrates 3-C phosphate group with enzyme active site histidine and facilitates phosphate transfer returning the enzyme to its initial phosphorylated state and releasing product 2-phosphoglycerate. 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate is required a cofactor for dPGM. In contrast, the iPGM class is independent of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and catalyzes the intramolecular transfer of the phosphate group on monophosphoglycerates using a phosphoserineintermediate. =Reaction Summary= 3PG + P-Enzyme ‚Üí 2,3BPG + Enzyme ‚Üí 2PG + P-Enzyme 3-phosphoglycerate intermediate 2-phosphoglycerate ŒîG¬∞‚Ä≤=+1.1kcal/mol''' Image:3-phospho-D-glycerate wpmp.png3PG Image:2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate.svg2,3BPG Image:2-phospho-D-glycerate wpmp.png2PG Isozymes Phosphoglycerate mutase exists primarily as a dimer of two either identical or closely related subunits of about 32kDa. The enzyme is found in organisms as simple as yeast through Homo sapiens and its structure is highly conserved throughout. (Yeast PGM‚âà74% conserved vs mammal form). In mammals, the enzyme subunits appear to be either a muscle-derived form (m-type) or other tissue (b-type for brain where the b-isozyme was originally isolated). Existing as a dimer, the enzyme then has 3 isozymes depending on which subunit forms makeup the whole molecule (mm, bb or mb). The mm-type is found mainly in smooth muscle almost exclusively. The mb-isozyme is found in cardiac and skeletal muscle and the bb-type is found in the rest of tissues. While all three isozymes may be found in any tissue, the above distributions are based on prevalence in each. Interactive pathway map Regulation Phosphoglycerate mutase has a small positive Gibbs free energy and this reaction proceeds easily in both directions. Since it is a reversible reaction, it is not the site of major regulation mechanisms or regulation schemes for the glycolytic pathway. Anionic molecules such as vanadate, acetate, chloride ion, phosphate, 2-phosphoglycolate, and N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-amino]ethanesulfonate are known inhibitors of the mutase activity of dPGM. Studies have shown dPGM to be sensitive to changes in ionic concentration, where increasing concentrations of salts result in the activation of the enzyme‚Äôs phosphatase activity while inhibiting its mutase activity. Certain salts, such as KCl, are known to be competitive inhibitors in respect to 2-phosphoglycerate and mutase activity. Both phosphate and 2-phosphoglycolate are competitive inhibitors of mutase activity in respect to the substrates 2-phosphoglycerate and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Clinical significance In humans the PGAM2 gene which encodes this enzyme is located on the short arm of chromosome 7. Deficiency of phosphoglycerate mutase causes glycogen storage disease type X, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder with symptoms ranging from mild to moderate; is not thought life-threatening and can be managed with changes in lifestyle. This presents as a metabolic myopathy and is one of the many forms of syndromes formerly referred to as muscular dystrophy. PGAM1 deficiency affects the liver, while PGAM2 deficiency affects the muscle. Onset is generally noted as childhood to early adult though some who may be mildly affected by the disorder may not know they have it. Patients with PGAM deficiency are usually asymptomatic, except when they engage in brief, strenuous efforts which may trigger myalgias, cramps, muscle necrosis and myoglobinuria. An unusual pathologic feature of PGAM deficiency is the association with tubular aggregates. The symptoms are an intolerance to physical exertion or activity, cramps and muscle pain. Permanent weakness is rare. The disease is not progressive and has an excellent prognosis.

It was first developed by √ñstling & Johansson in 1984 and later modified by Singh et al. in 1988. It has since increased in popularity as a standard technique for evaluation of DNA damage/repair, biomonitoring and genotoxicity testing. It involves the encapsulation of cells in a low-melting- point agarose suspension, lysis of the cells in neutral or alkaline (pH>13) conditions, and electrophoresis of the suspended lysed cells. The term \\"comet\\" refers to the pattern of DNA migration through the electrophoresis gel, which often resembles a comet. The comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis) is a simple method for measuring deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strand breaks in eukaryotic cells. Cells embedded in agarose on a microscope slide are lysed with detergent and high salt to form nucleoids containing supercoiled loops of DNA linked to the nuclear matrix. Electrophoresis at high pH results in structures resembling comets, observed by fluorescence microscopy; the intensity of the comet tail relative to the head reflects the number of DNA breaks. The likely basis for this is that loops containing a break lose their supercoiling and become free to extend toward the anode. This is followed by visual analysis with staining of DNA and calculating fluorescence to determine the extent of DNA damage. This can be performed by manual scoring or automatically by imaging software. Procedure =Encapsulation= A sample of cells, either derived from an in vitro cell culture or from an in vivo test subject is dispersed into individual cells and suspended in molten low- melting-point agarose at 37 ¬∞C. This mono-suspension is cast on a microscope slide. A glass cover slip is held at an angle and the mono-suspension applied to the point of contact between the coverslip and the slide. As the coverslip is lowered onto the slide the molten agarose spreads to form a thin layer. The agarose is gelled at 4 ¬∞C and the coverslip removed. The agarose forms a matrix of carbohydrate fibres that encapsulate the cells, anchoring them in place. The agarose is considered to be osmotic-neutral, therefore solutions can penetrate the gel and affect the cells without cells shifting position. In an in vitro study the cells would be exposed to a test agent ‚Äì typically UV light, ionising radiation, or a genotoxic chemical ‚Äì to induce DNA damage in the encapsulated cells. For calibration, hydrogen peroxide is usually used to provide a standardized level of DNA damage. =Lysis= The slides are then immersed in a solution that cause the cells to lyse. The lysis solution often used in the comet assay consists of a highly concentrated aqueous salt (often, common table salt can be used) and a detergent (such as Triton X-100 or sarcosinate). The pH of the lysis solution can be adjusted (usually between neutral and alkaline pH) depending upon the type of damage the researcher is investigating. The aqueous salt disrupts proteins and their bonding patterns within the cell as well as disrupting the RNA content of the cell. The detergent dissolves the cellular membranes. Through the action of the lysis solution the cells are destroyed. All proteins, RNA, membranes and cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic constituents are disrupted and diffuse into the agarose matrix. Only the DNA of the cell remains, and unravels to fill the cavity in the agarose that the whole cell formerly filled. This structure is called nucleoid (a general term for a structure in which DNA is concentrated). =Electrophoresis= After lysis of the cells (typically 1 to 2 hours at 4 ¬∞C) the slides are washed in distilled water to remove all salts and immersed in a second solution ‚Äì an electrophoresis solution. Again this solution can have its pH adjusted depending upon the type of damage that is being investigated. The slides are left for ~20 minutes in the electrophoresis solution prior to an electric field being applied. In alkaline conditions the DNA double helix is denatured and the nucleoid becomes single stranded. An electric field is applied (typically 1 V/cm) for ~20 minutes. The slides are then neutralised to pH 7, stained with a DNA-specific fluorescent stain and analysed using a microscope with an attached CCD (charge-coupled device ‚Äì essentially a digital camera) that is connected to a computer with image analysis software. Background The concept underlying the SCGE assay is that undamaged DNA retains a highly organized association with matrix proteins in the nucleus. When damaged, this organization is disrupted. The individual strands of DNA lose their compact structure and relax, expanding out of the cavity into the agarose. When the electric field is applied the DNA, which has an overall negative charge, is drawn towards the positively charged anode. Undamaged DNA strands are too large and do not leave the cavity, whereas the smaller the fragments, the farther they are free to move in a given period of time. Therefore, the amount of DNA that leaves the cavity is a measure of the amount of DNA damage in the cell. The image analysis measures the overall intensity of the fluorescence for the whole nucleoid and the fluorescence of the migrated DNA and compares the two signals. The stronger the signal from the migrated DNA the more damage there is present. The overall structure resembles a comet (hence \\"comet assay\\") with a circular head corresponding to the undamaged DNA that remains in the cavity and a tail of damaged DNA. The brighter and longer the tail, the higher the level of damage. The comet assay is a versatile technique for detecting damage and with adjustments to the protocol can be used to quantify the presence of a wide variety of DNA altering lesions (damage). The damage usually detected are single strand breaks and double strand breaks. It is sometimes stated that alkaline conditions and complete denaturating of the DNA is necessary to detect single strand breaks. However this is not true, both single- and double strand breaks are also detected in neutral conditions. In alkaline conditions, however, additional DNA structures are detected as DNA damage: AP sites (abasic sites missing either a pyrimidine or purine nucleotide) and sites where excision repair is taking place. The comet assay is an extremely sensitive DNA damage assay. This sensitivity needs to be handled carefully as it is also vulnerable to physical changes which can affect the reproducibility of results. Essentially, anything that can cause DNA damage or denaturation except the factor(s) being researched is to be avoided.Theoretical and practical limitations to the assay are discussed e.g. in Klaude et al. (1996) and Collins et al. (1997). The most common form of the assay is the alkaline version although there is as yet no definitive alkaline assay protocol. Due to its simple and inexpensive setup, it can be used in conditions where more complex assays are not available. Applications These include genotoxicity testing, human biomonitoring and molecular epidemiology, ecogenotoxicology, as well as fundamental research in DNA damage and repair.https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/csmm/.../SCG%20Electrophoresis.pdf =Sperm DNA fragmentation= A comet assay can determine the degree of DNA fragmentation in sperm cells.

History Copper inscriptions, which are all taken from Chinnamanur in the British period, are available in London museum. Chinnamanur, stands back to a very historic period when the king of Madurai, Thiru. Rajasimar came to this land. It is a tradition in India where Lord Shiva is worshipped by presenting cow's milk on the Shiva lingam and performing the rituals. King Rajasimeshwaran being no exception had been performing the same kind of rituals. Once when a milkman was bringing milk to the kings place, he was hindered by a root in the ground, which was irregular in shape, almost like a rock. The man fell down spilling all the milk on the root. He continued bringing milk the next day and the same incident took place. This continued for some days together. The man planned to chop down the root and ran an axe over it. The moment he stuck it he found the root bleeding. Immediately after that he was stupefied seeing a long, swift and a luminous light with great intensity from the sky to the land in the same place of the root. The milkman ran to the king and told about the incident which took place in the midway. The king, a very pure devotee of Lord Shiva, became exuberant and realized that it is some play of the almighty and rushed to the place. The king was astonished seeing the vibrant energy of the lord standing from sky to land and raised his hands above his head, pleading in the namaste posture told, \\"Siva perumane\\". \\"Oh lord, you are so energetic, vibrant, luminous and I am flabbergasted looking at you. All my power and potentials are underneath your foot. Eshwara, how can I worship this marvelous, spectacular appearance of yours. Kindly come down to the level of common people as we always seek your eternal bliss\\". By these humble words of the king, Lord Shiva comes down to the same height of King Rajasimeshwaran in the form of lingam, as worshiped everywhere. The king becomes so glad that the Lord himself has accepted his worship and hugs the lingam tightly. As soon as he hugs the lingam, the love and warmth melts the lingam and the ornaments worn by the king gets embossed on it. This embossed ornaments are seen even today. A temple was then constructed by the king with the lingam as the deity in the middle, named as 'Thiru Poolanandeshwarar Sivakami Amman temple', Sivakami wife of lord Shiva who is commonly known as Parvati. Even today, in the temple, the lingam is traditionally worshiped with deeba aradanai (tradition of showing lighted lamp to the idol). The aradhanai shows the reflections of the embossed ornaments of king Rajasimeshwaran on the lingam. The deity has various other names like, 'Palkonda naadar' meaning, the lord who asked for milk; 'Alavodu alavanavar' meaning, the lord who came down for the humble request of a true devotee; ' Tazhuva Kudaindavar' meaning, the lord who was compassionate to the hug of an honest king and a true devotee. The deity is also named after the king as Rajasimeshwarar. This article is published to make many devotees to seek the bliss of Lord Shiva and also for tourists and travelers around the world. There are so many other evidences of Shiva in India, among which Chinnamanur is a very little example. Culture Chinnmanur Chithirai Festival Sivakami Amman Temple Chinnamanur Chithirai festival and Vinayagar Chathurthi are widely celebrated in the town. Car festival is also organized in the month of April/May every year. Vinayagar Chathurthi is celebrated for three days with the third being special, involving rally with 108 Vinayagar statues throughout the town and ends up at the Mullai river bridge in the west end of the town. There are three big mosques in the town and the main is Mohammad Nainarsha mosque (paeriya pallivasal), cinna masjid (cinna pallivasal), and the samikulam pallivasal. Muslims live there peacefully. Before 30 years it seems not many of them were educated and enrolled in the social activities like politics and doing a halal business (as per the norms of the Islamic rule example Muslims normally won't do finance business, since it is Haram and not halal). but at present, there are enormous number of people of this particular community becomes educated. Mostly they are engineers and working in India and abroad. People of this particular community is Rowthers and they obviously follow the Hanafi Islamic school of jurisprudence. This particular community people were living throughout chinnamanur particularly in k.k.kulam south Muslim street, and the people living in vadakku thaeru.and in saamikulam. According to mythology, this town has been in existence since the King of Madurai, Rajasimeshwaran, arrived here. It is believed that the temple was constructed at a site where the milkman of the king found a root. The king was informed about the place and he built a temple and named it as Thiru Poolanandeshwarar Sivakami Amman Temple. A Shiva Lingam is enshrined in this temple.

Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) ¬© Oxford University Press 2009 that are hewn by hand, usually with a broadaxe. There are 2,900 ties per mile of track on a first class railroad. The early railways would not accept ties cut with a saw, as it was claimed that the kerf of the saw splintered the fibres of the wood, leaving them more likely to soak up moisture causing premature rot. The process Geoff Marples wrote an account of being a tiehack in the East Kootenays in 1938 and described the process of making axe ties to include:Marples, Geoff. \\"The Tiehack\\", part 1.. British Columbia Forest History Newsletter. No. 60. August 2000. Victoria, B. C., Forest History Association of British Columbia. p. 1-4. print.Marples, Geoff. \\"The Tiehack\\", part 2.. British Columbia Forest History Newsletter. No. 61. December 2000. Victoria, B. C., Forest History Association of British Columbia. p. 1-4. print. First a suitable tree was chosen and then felling and limbing the tree. Next came scoring which is chopping, by eye without a chalk line, of notches to remove extra wood about every ; hewing the trunks only on two sides unless the log was over in diameter; bucking (cutting to in this case ); peeling any remaining bark off; and stacking the ties so a chain can be wrapped around them. Next came skidding each group of ties to a landing with a team of horses, and then loading and hauling the ties to a railway siding by truck and unloading by hand. Scaling was the key event where a railroad inspector accepted or culled (rejected) and graded each tie as a number one ( used for the main railroad lines) or number two ( used for sidings). Loading the ties by hand onto a car was the last task. Marples wrote that he netted 48¬¢ for each grade one, and 36¬¢ for each grade two and made $150 for a winter's work. Wood species Cedar was the most sought after wood for ties, since it is known for being extremely resistant to rot. However, as electric power came into more common use in the early 1900s, it was substituted with other species such as Tamarack. In northern regions where jack pine was plentiful, that species became a more common source for railway ties. Jack pine ties did not last as long as cedar or tamarack (lying on the ground), but were cheaper to produce. As creosote treatment came into use the axe ties were phased out, but jack pine remained best suited for softwood ties. Production in Canada Axe tie production was an early industry of importance for many communities in Ontario along the railway in the early 1900s. Examples include Foleyet and Nemegos.

The statement was accompanied by a video showing a few seconds of the beheading of one hostage, the beheaded corpse of a second hostage, and the shooting of a third. The execution of the fourth hostage is not shown. Aftermath On June 28, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian security services to locate and kill those responsible for the kidnapping and execution of the diplomats. Nikolai Patrushev, the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor organisation of the KGB, noted that the order would be carried out regardless of the \\"time and effort\\" required. A similar order was believed to have been issued against Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, the one-time acting president of the former Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Yandarbiyev was killed by a bomb in Doha, Qatar in February 2004. However, Aleksandr Goltz, a Russian military expert, questioned the ability of Russian intelligence agencies to carry out the assassination order in a country mired in civil war. One of the kidnappers of the Russian diplomats was captured in December 2006. He admitted his involvement in the incident and is believed to have personally beheaded two of the diplomats. Another kidnapper was killed in October 2008. He is believed to have personally shot one of the hostages. Another kidnapper was sentenced to death in May 2010.

It was one of the first businesses in San Diego County owned and operated by African-Americans. History Albert Robinson and Margaret Tull Robinson started, in 1887, a business originally named the Robinson Restaurant and Bakery. The business quickly became popular during the relatively brief gold rush that Julian experienced. Their hotel, which is still in operation, is the oldest continuing operating hotel in Southern California. The original hotel was constructed in 1897, with the bakery-restaurant structure razed to make room for the hotel. During construction, Albert planted cedar and locust trees around the hotel, which survive to the present day. The hotel has remained in business for over a hundred years and has repeatedly been expanded and improved, with air conditioning being a major new improvement added in the 21st Century. The historically restored 16-room building is currently known as the Julian Gold Rush Hotel. Albert was a former slave who came to Julian with his former slave owner. During the gold rush days of Julian, most of San Diego County's African-Americans lived in remote Julian, rather than the city of San Diego. Another influential black pioneer of the time, and a friend of the Robinsons, was America Newton, also a former slave and laundress during the town's gold rush days. Albert and Margaret met in Julian, Albert being employed at the time as a cook. They were married in the late 1880s. Albert died on June 10, 1915. Margaret sold the hotel in 1921.

Examples Near the end of the 1986 film Crossroads, Eugene Martone (played by Ralph Macchio) has a guitar battle with Jack Butler (played by Steve Vai). Macchio's guitar work was actually done by Steve Vai and Ry Cooder. In the 1991 documentary The Search for Robert Johnson, blues musician Johnny Shines re-enacts a headcutting battle he had with blues legend Robert Johnson on opposing street corners in Helena, Arkansas in the 1930s - to draw away each other's onlookers. In Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny (2006), the two protagonists challenge the Devil to a rock duel. This is, apparently, part of the demon code. A multiplayer game mode introduced in Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, called Battle Mode, is based around the guitar battle concept, only the players may use special power-up items to force each other to fail. The game also featured 3 of these guitar battles as boss battles against 2 real-life guitarists(presumably the titular \\"Legends of Rock\\"), namely Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine and Slash of Guns N' Roses, and Lou (a fictional musician representing the Devil of rock music). In Guitar Hero World Tour, the guitarist career features 2 guitar battles against Zakk Wylde and Ted Nugent wherein the player is challenged to a guitar duel by either of the two, and they take turns playing solos of a song specially recorded by either Wylde or Nugent in a manner similar to the existing Face- Off mode, although Battle Mode is still available to play. Judas Priest was one of the first bands to use dual guitars in heavy metal. A good example is their song \\"Metal Meltdown,\\" in which guitarists Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing take turns playing guitar solos for the first thirty seconds of the song.http://www.revelationz.net/index.asp?ID=4174#sthash.OAbOzWAk.dpbs The Allman Brothers Band song, \\"Blue Sky\\" featured Duane Allman and Dickey Betts trading off lead guitar playing. \\"Hangar 18\\" from the album Rust in Peace features trade solos by Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman(starting at 3:38). The song ends with Mustaine's solo. The only guitar battle show on YouTube is made in Saint Petersburg, Russia. By the end of 2019 nine episodes were released.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKibwMAVSb9wCIlFDrYxFAw/videos References External links *Guitar War Online since 2001, Guitar War allows people to have guitar battles at all skill levels.

In: Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (the \\"Gold Book\\"). Compiled by A. D. McNaught and A. Wilkinson. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford (1997). Online version (2019-) created by S. J. Chalk. . . Formazan dyes are artificial chromogenic products of the reduction of tetrazolium salts by dehydrogenases and reductases. They have a variety of colors from dark blue to deep red to orange, depending on the original tetrazolium salt used as the substrate for the reaction. Structure and reactivity Formazans are intensely colorful compounds characterized by the following structure: [-N=N-C(R)=N-NH-], and are closely related to azo (‚àíN=N‚àí) dyes. Their structure was first defined in 1892, by von Pechmann and by Bamberger and Wheelwright independently. Their deep colour and redox chemistry derive from their nitrogen-rich backbone. Formazans have a high tautomeric and conformational flexibility. Due to the two alternating double bonds in the backbone, formazans can exist in four possible isomeric forms: syn, s-cis (closed form); syn, s-trans (open form); anti, s-cis; and anti, s-trans (linear form). 1,5-disubstituted formazans can exist as two tautomers (1 and 2 in the image below). Upon deprotonation, the formed anion (3) is stabilized by resonance. With transition metal ions (Cu2+, Co3+, Ni2+, Zn2+, etc), formazans form highly coloured complexes (chelates). 741x741px Due to their ability to react with both strong acids and bases, formazans can be considered amphoteric. Oxidation of such compounds results in their conversion into colorless tetrazolium salts. Among the various oxidants used are mercuric oxide, nitric acid, isoamyl nitrite, N-bromo succinimide, potassium permanganate, lead tetra-acetate and t-butyl hypochlorite. Depending on the conditions, tetrazolium salts can be reduced to form tetrazolyl radicals or formazan: 601x601px Synthesis There various synthetic methods for the synthesis of formazans. The reaction of diazonium compounds with aldehyde hydrazones is one of the most common procedures to produce formazans. Hydrazones, which are electron-rich compounds, react with diazonium salts either at a nitrogen or a carbon atom to produce formazans. Diazonium salts couple to the amine nitrogen in the hydrazone with displacement of a hydrogen to give the intermediate, which then rearranges to the formazan. Another form to synthesize formazans is by the reaction of active methylene compounds with diazonium salts. Diazonium salts add to active methylene compounds to form an intermediate azo compound, followed by the addition of a second diazonium salt (under more alkaline conditions), yielding tetrazene, which then forms a 3-substituted formazan. Formazans can also be produced by the oxidation of the corresponding hydrazidines, usually prepared via reaction of hydrazonyl halides with the appropriate hydrazine derivatives. For example, ethyl formate or orthoformate reacts with two equivalents of phenylhydrazine to yield 1,5-diphenylformazan, under acidic conditions. Under basic conditions, ethyl nitrate reacts at the methylene position to yield 3-methyl-1,5-diphenylformazan, which can also be obtained from the reaction of phenylazoethane with isoamyl nitrite. Additionally, formazans can be obtained by the decomposition of substituted tetrazolium salts either photochemically or under the influence of ascorbic acid in an alkaline medium. Application MTT test: Formation of formazan crystals from MTT in mesenchymal stem cells Tetrazolium salts and their formazan products are widely used in histochemical methods, especially in colorimetric viability assays. These procedures are based on the reduction of tetrazolium by mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymes, which is carried inside living cells: center Leading examples of the most used tetrazolium salts include: #INT or 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride, which is water-insoluble. #MTT or 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide, which is water-insoluble and used in the MTT assay. # XTT or 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide, which is water-soluble. #MTS or 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, which is water-soluble and used in the MTS assay. #TTC or tetrazolium chloride or 2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride, which is water-soluble. #NBT used in a diagnostic test, particularly for chronic granulomatous disease and other diseases of phagocyte function. When reduced in a cell, either enzymatically or through direct reaction with NADH or NADPH, the classical tetrazolium salt, MTT, turns blue to purple and may form an insoluble precipitate. These formazan dyes are commonly used in cell proliferation and toxicity assays such as the EpiDerm and EpiSkin tests since they only stain living, metabolically active cells.

It lies on the coast of the Arabian Sea. Etymology It is said to have derived its name from being a notorious haunt of pirates. History Chorvad has been since the earliest days famous for its betel gardens, and the flavour of Chorvad betel is supposed to be very superior, and it is largely exported not only inland but also by sea. Chorvad was in ancient times a dependency of Mangrol. In later times, i. e. after the collapse of the Mughal power in the Saurashtra peninsula, it was seized on by the Raizadas, but we have no record of the exact date of such seizure ; but Sanghji or Singhji, the Raizada Garasia of Chorvad, took an active part in the intestine wars of the nineteenth century ; but he was killed in the battle of Malia fought between him and Aliya Hatti, and his descendants were much embarrassed as to how they should defray the arrears of the soldiery. As Rana Sultanji of Porbandar State was connected by marriage with the deceased Singhji, his relatives in 1787 entrusted the fort and town to him on condition that he should defray the demands of the Sipahis. The Rana agreed and took possession of the town and then his commandant of this town captured Veraval. This caused a general insurrection against the Nawab along the coast, and Sutrapada also rebelled. But in the course of a short time Veraval was recovered and Chorvad also was conquered in 1788. Mokaji, the chief Raizada Garasia, was permitted to retire with his family to Dhoraji on this occasion under the protection of Jadeja Kumbhoji of Gondal State. So Chorvad became a khalsa (crown) domain of the Junagadh State. Demographics The population according to the 1872 census was 2818 souls, but this fell to 1299 after the severe famine of 1878‚Äì79. India census, Chorvad had a population of 21,196. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Chorvad has an average literacy rate of 50%, lower than the national average of 59.5%; with male literacy of 62% and female literacy of 38%. 12% of the population is under 6 years of age.

This amphibian is distributed in Kashmir, Nepal, peninsular India and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. It was previously considered to be the same species as Microhyla fissipes; therefore, the aforementioned common names can refer to either species. Description Specimen seen at Jalpaiguri(Berubari) Palash Ball Frogs of the genus Microhyla are small. They can be identified by the typical arrow-shaped mark on their dorsal side. They are generally of yellowish color with dark brown patch. This species has a small head, no teeth and no discernible tympani. The fingertips are spathulate and there is little webbing between the digits. The males do not have nuptial pads. The skin on the back is mainly smooth, but there are some granulations. Males are about from snout to vent and females about . Distribution and habitat The ornate narrow- mouthed frog is native to Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. It is found in grass and leaf litter in habitats ranging from tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests and tropical and subtropical coniferous forests. In some habitats, this frog may take shelter in the dung of elephants. Biology The ornate narrow-mouthed frog lives semi-buried in leaf litter on the forest floor. It is mainly nocturnal but it is also active during the day during the rainy season. It breeds in ponds and temporary pools that form in the rainy season. Status This frog has a wide range and the population seems to be stable so the IUCN rates it as being of \\"Least Concern\\" as it considers that the rate of decline, if any, is insufficient to justify listing it in a more threatened category. It is common throughout most of its range and is tolerant of a range of different habitat types. No particular threats to this species have been identified.

It was described by John Edward Gray in 1830. Date is often given as \\"1833\\" but the volume in question was already out in 1830 . Although now considered as a separate species again, for a time, the Himalayan tree frog was considered as a subspecies of the Indian tree frog (as P. m. himalayensis). Polypedates leucomystax, a very similar species, was formerly included in P. maculatus. right Description At Kandalama, Sri Lanka These frogs measure about 7‚Äì8 cm in body length. They are mostly brownish, yellowish, greyish, or whitish above, with darker spots or markings, rarely with an hourglass-shaped figure on the back of the head and the front of the back. The loreal and temporal regions are dark; there is a light line on the upper lip. The hind side of the thighs has round, yellow spots, which are usually separated by a dark-brown or purplish network. The skin is smooth above, and granulated on the belly and under the thighs; a fold extends from the eye to the shoulder. Males have internal vocal sacs. The vomerine teeth are arranged in two more or less oblique series between the choanae or commencing close to the inner front edge of the latter. The skin of head is free; a more or less developed bony arch ‚Äì sometimes slender and partly ligamentous, sometimes very thick and swollen ‚Äì extends on each side from the posterior border of the frontoparietal bones to the squamosals. The snout is pointed with a rounded tip, about as long as the diameter of the orbit, the canthus rostralis is distinct, and the loral region is concave. The nostril is located much nearer to the end of the snout than to the eye. The interorbital space is broader than the upper eyelid. The eardrum measures about three- fourths the diameter of the eye. The fingers are barely webbed, and the toes are two-thirds webbed. The disks of fingers and toes are moderately developed; that of the third finger measures two-fifths to one-half the diameter of the eye. The subarticular tubercles are of moderate size. When the hind leg is held alongside the body, the tibiotarsal articulation reaches the eye, or between the eye and the tip of the snout. Distribution and ecology It is widespread throughout Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, as well as western and southern Bangladesh to Chittagong District; its range might also extend into nearby China and Myanmar. This common and adaptable frog is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN. They may use day roosts regularly. Their call is a sudden short and rapid series of rattling rat-tats. They wipe themselves with skin secretions consisting of mucus and lipids that help in reducing moisture loss. When temperatures are higher, they secrete from the skin (\\"sweat\\"), pant, and adopt lighter skin colours., Footnotes References * . * , Plate 82 image. * . * . * . * .

The original stage play opened on Broadway February 7, 1922. Plot Florence Eldridge as Anabelle West, imperiled heroine of The Cat and the Canary (1922) The story concerns the death and inheritance of old Cyrus West, a rich eccentric who felt that his relatives \\"have watched my wealth as if they were cats, and I ‚Äî a canary\\". He decrees that his will be read 20 years after his death, at which point his relatives converge at his old family home, now a spooky old haunted mansion. The will reads that his most distant relative still bearing the name of West be sole heir, provided they are legally sane. The rest of the night spent in the house calls into question the sanity of Annabelle West, a fragile young woman who is legally Cyrus West's heir. Production Produced by Kilbourn Gordon and directed by Ira Hards, The Cat and the Canary premiered February 7, 1922, at the National Theatre. It ran 349 performances, closing December 2, 1922. The three-act mystery made a return engagement of 40 performances (April 23 ‚Äì May 26, 1923). =Cast= The Cat and the Canary cast from left: Blanche Friderici, Henry Hull, Beth Franklyn, Jane Warrington and Florence Eldridge * Percy Moore as Roger Crosby * Blanche Friderici as \\"Mammy\\" Pleasant * John Willard as Harry Blythe * Beth Franklyn as Susan Sillsby * Jane Warrington as Cicely Young * Ryder Keane as Charles Wilder * Henry Hull as Paul Jones * Florence Eldridge as Annabelle West * Edmund Elton as Hendricks * Harry D.
