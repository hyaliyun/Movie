Promoted to lieutenant in 1831, captain in 1837 and then Chef d'escadron (Major or Commandant) in 1850, he completed his military career as deputy director of the Ecole d'Artillerie de Montpellier, to which he was appointed in 1859. Montgravier spent three periods in Algeria, from 1832 to 1834, from 1839 to 1845, and finally from 1846 to 1851. In the first two periods he acted as Officer for Arab affairs, and in the third period he started as assistant officer in the Oran bureau, becoming chief officer in 1849 and then moving on in 1850 to the advisory committee on Algeria at the Ministry of War. Archaeology He was passionate about antiques, and was one of the pioneers of Roman Archaeology in North Africa. In 1840, he was the first to identify Cherchell as the ancient Caesarea, the capital of Mauretania. He was an active member of the Société Historique Algérienne, and copied and published many ancient stone inscriptions discovered during his missions. His contribution to North African Archaeology led to him being elected corresponding member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles- Lettres on 27 December 1850. At the end of his life, he carried out excavations at the Roman ruins of Murviel-les-Montpellier on behalf of the Commission de la Carte des Gaules. He was decorated with the Legion of Honour on 14 April 1844, and was created officer of the same order in 1862.

The films, Zeitgeist: The Movie (2007), Zeitgeist: Addendum (2008) and Zeitgeist: Moving Forward (2011) are all directed by Peter Joseph. Zeitgeist: The Movie Zeitgeist: The Movie is a 2007 film by Peter Joseph presenting a number of conspiracy theories. The film assembles archival footage, animations, and narration. Released online on June 18, 2007, it soon received tens of millions of views on Google Video, YouTube, and Vimeo. According to Peter Joseph, the original Zeitgeist was not presented in a film format, but was a \\"performance piece consisting of a vaudevillian, multimedia style event using recorded music, live instruments, and video\\". Horus left and Jesus right, both presented as \\"solar messiahs\\" in Zeitgeist: the Movie. Synopsis The film's introduction features animations, footage of war, explosions, and the September 11 attacks and audio quotes from Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche and George Carlin. Part I claims that the Christian religion is mainly derived from other religions, astronomical assertions, astrological myths, and other traditions. In furtherance of the Jesus myth hypothesis, this part disputes the historicity of Jesus, who, it claims, is a literary and astrological hybrid, nurtured by political forces and opportunists. Part I was influenced by the work of Acharya S.http://www.stellarhousepublishing.com/zeitgeistsourcebook.pdf 9/11 attacks are the subject of part II of Zeitgeist: the Movie. Part II alleges that the September 11 attacks were either orchestrated or allowed to happen by elements within the United States government in order to generate mass fear, justify the War on Terror, provide a pretext for the curtailment of civil liberties, and produce economic gain. It asserts that the U.S. government had advance knowledge of the attacks, that the military deliberately allowed the planes to reach their targets, and that World Trade Center buildings 1, 2, and 7 underwent a controlled demolition. Part III states that the Federal Reserve System is controlled by a small cabal of international bankers who conspire to create global calamities to enrich themselves. Three wars involving the United States during the twentieth century are highlighted as part of this alleged agenda, started by specifically engineered events, including the sinking of the RMS Lusitania, the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. The film asserts that such wars serve to sustain conflict in general and force the U.S. government to borrow money, thereby increasing the profits of the international bankers. The film also claims that the Federal Income Tax is illegal. Zeitgeist: the Movie claims that the U.S. Government's income tax is unconstitutional. Part III also alleges a secret agreement to merge the United States, Canada and Mexico into a North American Union as a step toward the creation of a single world government. The film speculates that under such a government, every human could be implanted with an RFID chip to monitor individual activity and suppress dissent. Reception The first film received almost universal condemnation from the media, though it also \\"attracted massive interest\\" from the public. The newspaper The Arizona Republic described Zeitgeist: The Movie as \\"a bramble of conspiracy theories involving Sept. 11, the international monetary system, and Christianity\\" saying also that the movie trailer states that \\"there are people guiding your life and you don't even know it\\". A review in The Irish Times wrote that \\"these are surreal perversions of genuine issues and debates, and they tarnish all criticism of faith, the Bush administration, and globalization—there are more than enough factual injustices in this world to be going around without having to invent fictional ones\\". Ivor Tossell in The Globe and Mail cited it as an example of how modern conspiracy theories are promulgated, though he praised its effectiveness: > The film is an interesting object lesson on how conspiracy theories get to > be so popular ... It's a driven, if uneven, piece of propaganda, a marvel of > tight editing and fuzzy thinking. Its on-camera sources are mostly > conspiracy theorists, co-mingled with selective eyewitness accounts, drawn > from archival footage and often taken out of context. It derides the media > as a pawn of the International Bankers, but produces media reports for > credibility when convenient. The film ignores expert opinion, except the > handful of experts who agree with it. And yet, it's compelling. It > shamelessly ploughs forward, connecting dots with an earnest certainty that > makes you want to give it an A for effort. Filipe Feio, reflecting upon the film's Internet popularity in Diário de Notícias, stated that \\"[f]iction or not, Zeitgeist: The Movie threatens to become the champion of conspiracy theories of today\\". Michael Shermer, founder of the Skeptics Society, mentioned Zeitgeist in an article in Scientific American on skepticism in the age of mass media and the postmodern belief in the relativism of truth. He argues that this belief, coupled with a \\"clicker culture of mass media,\\" results in a multitude of various truth claims packaged in \\"infotainment units\\", in the form of films such as Zeitgeist and Loose Change. Jane Chapman, a film producer and reader in media studies at the University of Lincoln, called Zeitgeist \\"a fast-paced assemblage of agitprop,\\" an example of \\"unethical film-making\\". Chapman accused Peter Joseph of \\"implicit deception\\" through the use of standard film-making propaganda techniques. While parts of the film are, she says, \\"comically\\" self-defeating, the nature of \\"twisted evidence\\" and use of Madrid bomb footage to imply it is of the London bombings amount to \\"ethical abuse in sourcing\\". She finishes her analysis with the comment: \\"Thus, legitimate questions about what happened on 9/11, and about corruption in religious and financial organizations, are all undermined by the film's determined effort to maximize an emotional response at the expense of reasoned argument.\\" Alex Jones, American radio host, conspiracy theorist and executive producer of Loose Change, stated that film segments of Zeitgeist are taken directly from his documentary Terrorstorm, and that he supports \\"90 percent\\" of the film. Skeptic magazine's Tim Callahan, criticizing the parts of the film on the origins of Christianity, wrote that \\"some of what it asserts is true. Unfortunately, this material is liberally—and sloppily—mixed with material that is only partially true and much that is plainly and simply bogus.\\" Chris Forbes, Senior lecturer in Ancient History of Macquarie University and member of the Synod of the Diocese of Sydney, severely criticized Part I of the film, stating that it has no basis in serious scholarship or ancient sources, and that it relies on amateur sources that recycle frivolous ideas from one another, commenting that \\"[i]t is extraordinary how many claims it makes which are simply not true\\". Similar conclusions were reached by Dr. Mark Foreman of Liberty University. In Tablet magazine, journalist Michelle Goldberg criticized Zeitgeist: The Movie as being \\"steeped in far-right, isolationist, and covertly anti-Semitic conspiracy theories,\\" writing that the film borrowed from the work of Eustace Mullins, Lyndon LaRouche, and radio host Alex Jones, and that it portrays a cabal of international bankers purportedly ruling the world. In an interview with TheMarker, Joseph said that while the film does mention bankers it does not seek to blame any individual or group of individuals. He argued they are merely a product of a socioeconomic system in need of change., TheMarkerTV (Israel), Jan. 19, 2012. Interview conducted in English, following a brief introduction to Joseph and the Movement in Hebrew. Chip Berlet wrote that the 9/11 conspiracy theories \\"are bait used to attract viewers from the 9/11 Truth movement and others who embrace conspiracist thinking to the idiosyncratic antireligion views of the videographer and the world of right-wing antisemitic theories of a global banking conspiracy\\". Jay Kinney questioned the accuracy of its claims and the quality of its arguments, describing it as agitprop and propaganda. At times, according to Kinney, \\"Zeitgeist engages in willful confusion by showing TV screen shots of network or cable news with voice-overs from unidentified people not associated with the news programs. If one weren't paying close attention, the effect would be to confer the status and authority of TV news upon the words being spoken. Even when quotes or sound bites are attributed to a source, there's no way to tell if they are quoted correctly or in context.\\" Use in other media In June 2013, Peter Joseph directed the music video for \\"God Is Dead?\\" by Black Sabbath, using extensive imagery from Zeitgeist: The Movie and its sequels. Zeitgeist: Addendum Zeitgeist: Addendum is a 2008 film produced and directed by Peter Joseph, and is a sequel to the 2007 film, Zeitgeist: The Movie. It premiered at the 5th Annual Artivist Film Festival in Los Angeles, California on October 2, 2008. Synopsis The film begins and ends with excerpts from a speech by Jiddu Krishnamurti. The remainder of the film is narrated by Peter Joseph and divided into four parts, which are prefaced by on-screen quotations from Krishnamurti, John Adams, Bernard Lietaer, and Thomas Paine, respectively. Part I covers the process of fractional-reserve banking as illustrated in Modern Money Mechanics, by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. The film suggests that society is manipulated into economic slavery through debt-based monetary policies by requiring individuals to submit for employment in order to pay off their debt. Part II has an interview with John Perkins, author of Confessions of an Economic Hitman, who says he was involved in the subjugation of Latin American economies by multinational corporations and the United States government, including involvement in the overthrow of Latin American heads-of-state. Perkins sees the US as a corporatocracy, in which maximization of profits is the first priority. Part III introduces futurist Jacque Fresco and The Venus Project and asserts a need to move away from current socioeconomic paradigms. Fresco states that capitalism perpetuates the conditions it claims to address, as problems are only solved if there is money to be made. The film looks at Fresco's proposal of a resource-based economy, which puts environmental friendliness, sustainability and abundance as fundamental societal goals. He goes on to discuss technology which he sees as the primary driver of human advancement, and he describes politics as being unable to solve any problems. Part IV suggests that the primary reason for what the film sees as society's social values (\\"warfare, corruption, oppressive laws, social stratification, irrelevant superstitions, environmental destruction, and a despotic, socially indifferent, profit oriented ruling class\\") is a collective ignorance of \\"the emergent and symbiotic aspects of natural law\\". The film advocates the following actions for achieving social change: boycotting of the most powerful banks in the Federal Reserve System, the major news networks, the military, energy corporations, all political systems; and joining, and supporting The Zeitgeist Movement. Reception Zeitgeist: Addendum won the 2008 Artivist Film Festival's award for best feature (\\"Artivist Spirit\\" category). Originally, the film was uploaded-released on Google Video. The current video posting on YouTube surpassed 5 million views by late 2013. Alan Feuer of The New York Times noted that while the first film was famous for alleging that the attacks of September 11 were an inside job, the second, \\"was all but empty of such conspiratorial notions, directing its rhetoric and high production values toward posing a replacement for the evils of the banking system and a perilous economy of scarcity and debt\\". Zeitgeist: Moving Forward Zeitgeist: Moving Forward is the third installment in Peter Joseph's Zeitgeist film series. The film premiered at the JACC Theater in Los Angeles on January 15, 2011 at the Artivist Film Festival, was released in theaters and online. As of November 2014, the film had over 23 million views on YouTube. The film is arranged in four parts, each containing interviews, narration and animated sequences.  Synopsis  The film begins with an animated sequence narrated by Jacque Fresco. He describes his adolescent life and his discontinuation of public education at the age of 14 and describes his early life influences. Part I: Human Nature Human behavior and the nature vs. nurture debate is discussed, which Robert Sapolsky refers to as a \\"false dichotomy.\\" Disease, criminal activity, and addictions are also discussed. The overall conclusion of Part I is that social environment and cultural conditioning play a large part in shaping human behavior. Part II: Social Pathology John Locke and Adam Smith are discussed in regard to modern economics. The film critically questions the economic need for private property, money, and the inherent inequality between agents in the system. Also seen critically is the need for cyclical consumption in order to maintain market share, resulting in wasted resources and planned obsolescence. According to the movie, the current monetary system will result in default or hyperinflation at some future time. Part III: Project Earth As with Zeitgeist: Addendum, the film presents a \\"resource-based economy\\" as advocated by Jacque Fresco discussing how human civilization could start from a new beginning in relation to resource types, locations, quantities, to satisfy human demands; track the consumption and depletion of resources to regulate human demands and maintain the condition of the environment. Part IV: Rise The current worldwide situation is described as disastrous. A case is presented that pollution, deforestation, climate change, overpopulation, and warfare are all created and perpetuated by the socioeconomic system. Various poverty statistics are shown that suggest a progressive worsening of world culture. The final scene of the film shows a partial view of earth from space, followed by a sequence of superimposed statements; \\"This is your world\\", \\"This is our world\\", and \\"The revolution is now\\".

A The Socialist Standard review said the film's use of animation and humour gave it a \\"well rounded feel\\", though it criticized the \\"shaky economic analysis\\" in the second part of the film, saying \\"Karl Marx had already undertaken a more scientific analysis\\", adding, \\"the analysis is at least on the right track\\". Regarding transition to the new system proposed in the film, the reviewer noted \\"there is no mention of how to get from here to there\\". In an article, in Tablet magazine, Michelle Goldberg described the film as \\"silly enough that at times [she] suspected it was [a] sly satire about new-age techno-utopianism instead of an example of it\\". She describes the 3 Zeitgeist movies as \\"a series of 3 apocalyptic cult documentaries.

Known from fossil deposits in England and Germany, the genus currently contains the single species A. densus, which was first described in 2012. Its discovery was important in the research of ichthyosaurs, as being one of the first known ophthalmosaurines from the Early Cretaceous, it provided evidence that no mass extinction of ichthyosaurs occurred during the Jurasic-Cretaceous boundary as previously understood. Nevertheless, Acamptonectes remains one of only eight genera of ichthyosaurs known during the Cretaceous. In life, Acamptonectes was probably a generalist predator. Its teeth were slender and textured with longitudinal ridges, which were best adapted for impaling prey; as a result, Acamptonectes likely fed on soft, fleshier prey such as fish and squid. The ichthyosaur's body was rigid and compact, which was suited for swimming at high speeds in tuna-like locomotion. History of discovery Basicranium (A-E), stapes (F-G), and teeth (J-K) of the holotype: The generic name partially refers to the tightly fitting bones of the occiput; the arrow by the exoccipital (E) shows a notch that would closely fit a bump on the basioccipital. Over a series of weekends in 1958, four students and a technician from the geology department of Hull University collected an ichthyosaur (or \\"fish lizard\\", a Mesozoic group of marine reptiles) specimen from the Speeton Clay Formation of Speeton in northern England. It was transferred to the Hunterian Museum of the University of Glasgow in 1991, when the geology department of Hull University was closed, where it was catalogued as specimen GLAHM 132855 (it was also known as the \\"Speeton Clay ichthyosaur\\"). It consists of a partial skeleton of an adult, including a fragmentary skull roof, a mandible, the axial skeleton, and the scapular girdle. Palaeontologist Robert M. Appleby described the specimen and assigned it to the genus Platypterygius as the species \\"P. speetoni\\" (which he considered primitive within that genus), in a monograph that remained unpublished at the time of his death in 2003. A second specimen of this ichthyosaur was found in 1985, also in the Speeton Clay, and is catalogued as NHMUK R11185 at the Natural History Museum, London. It consists of a partial rostrum and mandible, fragmentary ribs, and a complete right humerus. Palaeontologist Jeff Liston, who had recognised the significance of the Speeton Clay icthyosaur while working at the Hunterian Museum, and had been asked by Appleby's widow to help finish his unpublished monograph, approached ichthyosaur specialist Valentin Fischer about writing a description of the animal. Fischer examined the specimen in 2011, and realised it represented the same taxon as an ichthyosaur specimen from Cremlingen in northern Germany, which he had recently written a draft paper about with some colleagues. The German specimen was discovered in 2005, when private fossil collector Hans- Dieter Macht found some vertebrae in a construction area. Macht notified the director of the State Natural History Museum of Braunschweig, whereafter excavation began; the specimen was collected within three days, since construction work had to continue. It was prepared and mounted at the museum in 2005, where it is catalogued as SNHM1284-R. It consists of a partial skeleton of a subadult, including a fragmentary skull roof, a complete mandible, a partial axial skeleton, and a partial scapular girdle. It was referred to as Platypterygius in a 2008 article. Bones of the scapular girdles of SNHM1284-R and the holotype After determining that the Speeton Clay specimen was much larger than that from Cremlingen, Liston and Fischer decided to make it the holotype of the new species (since juvenile traits are often not found in adults), with the Cremlingen specimen as paratype, and the other Speeton Clay specimen as an additional paratype. A team of palaeontologists led by Fischer formally named the new genus and species Acamptonectes densus in 2012. The generic name is derived from the Greek words akamptos and nektes, which means rigid swimmer, and the specific name means compact, or tightly packed. In full, the binomial name refers to the robust, tightly fitting bones of the occiput, and the tightly interlocking centra (\\"bodies\\") of the cervical (neck) and dorsal (back) vertebrae. The holotype, GLAHM 132855, was listed under the inaccurate specimen number GLAHM 132588 in the description. In 1909, German palaeontologist Ferdinand Broili named the species Ichthyosaurus brunsvicensis (tentatively placed in that genus) based on an ichthyosaur specimen from Hannover, Germany. It consisted of an incomplete basicranium and an incomplete interclavicle, but was destroyed during WW2. Palaeontologist Christopher McGowan considered it to belong to Platypterygius in 1972 and 2003, but Fischer and colleagues found it appropriate to assign it to cf. Acamptonectes (difficult to identify). They found it similar to Acamptonectes in several features, while also differing in some ways, and suggested it was a juvenile due to the size and shape of its basicranium. They considered I. brunsvicensis a nomen dubium due to being fragmentary, as well as not being available for study anymore. Multiple basioccipitals, stapes, and a basisphenoid from the Cambridge Greensand Formation of Cambridge, England, were also assigned to Acamptonectes sp. (of uncertain species within the genus) by Fischer and colleagues. Some of these elements are essentially identical to those of A. densus, while others differ in some details. The specimens are generally small, and their differences from A. densus may be related to the ages of the animals or evolutionary changes. Most of these specimens are housed at Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences, Cambridge, with a few at the Hunterian Museum and Natural History Museum. In 2014, though, Fischer and colleagues found this identification disputable, since Acamptonectes was no longer the only known Cretaceous ophthalmosaurine ichthyosaur from Eurasia. They therefore listed the material from the Cambridge Greensand as belonging to indeterminate ophthalmosaurines, not identifiable below the subfamily level. Description Life restoration Acamptonectes was similar in morphology to the related but earlier ophthalmosaurids Ophthalmosaurus and Mollesaurus. Features of the humerus in specimen SNHM1284-R indicate immaturity, but it lacks the sandpaper-like texture present on the shaft of the humerus in juvenile ichthyosaurs, so is thought to be a subadult. The holotype and NHMUK R11185 are large ophthalmosaurids, and the former is thought to be an adult due to the full fusion of its bones, as seen in the closely fitting occiput bones, and the smooth texture of the humerus. As an ichthyosaur, Acamptonectes had a long, thin snout, large eye sockets, and a tail fluke (the lower part of which was supported by vertebrae), and they were therefore superficially similar to dolphins. They had flippers instead of legs, and except for early species, had dorsal fins. Although no evidence is specific to Acamptonectes, at least some ichthyosaurs may have been uniformly dark-colored in life, demonstrated by the discovery of high eumelanin contents in the preserved skin of an older ichthyosaur fossil. Skull Nasal bones (A-B), supratemporal (C), and supraoccipital (D-F) of the holotype The snout was elongated and extremely slender – in front of the bony nostrils, it was only 45 mm wide in the holotype specimen. The snout also was only 0.044 times as deep as long, which is one of the lowest ratios found in ophthalmosaurids. Much of the snout was formed by the premaxillae, which formed the front portion of the upper jaw. The fossa praemaxillaris, a groove that ran parallel with the tooth row of the upper jaw, was deep and continuous, ending in a series of aligned foramina (depressions). Behind and above the premaxillae were the nasals, which are three-dimensionally preserved in the holotype, documenting the shape of the upper side of the snout. On its back part, the nasal featured a downward- extending bulge, similar to that seen in some related genera including Ophthalmosaurus. This bulge also gave rise to a short but robust wing-like extension that formed an overhang over the hind part of the bony nostril; this feature was also present in Ophthalmosaurus icenicus and Platypterygius australis. The edge of this overhang was roughened, indicating that this was probably the attachment site for a soft-tissue structure. The hind part of the skull roof is only incompletely known, including the hind part of the lacrimal (in front of the eye opening), the postfrontal (above and behind the eye opening), the parietal (at the rear of the skull roof), and parts of a supratemporal (which formed the rear corners of the skull roof). An forward- directed extension of the supratemporal formed the inner-rear edge of the supratemporal fenestra, an opening through the skull roof behind the eyes. The parietal, which would have formed the inner margin of the supratemporal fenestra, had a complex front margin that was interdigitating with either the frontal or postfrontal bones, which are not preserved in the known specimens. Skull and partial neck of SNHM1284-R from below, with interpretative diagram The quadrate bone, which connected to the lower jaw to form the jaw joint, was C-shaped in side view. Two probable hyoid bones (tongue bones) are preserved with specimen SNHM1284-R; these bones were rod-like, with one end spatula- shaped. The stapes (bone in the ear region that is used for hearing) had a shaft that was more slender than in any other ichthyosaur, and its head was large and square—these features are regarded an autapomorphy (unique feature) and serve to distinguish the genus from related genera. The basisphenoid, a bone of the lower part of the braincase, had a well-developed crest on its upper surface, which also is considered an autapomorphy. In other ichthyosaurs, the basisphenoid instead formed a wide plateau. At its front end, the basisphenoid was fused to the parasphenoid, and no suture (border between the two bones) can be seen. The supraoccipital at the upper rear of the braincase was only weakly arched and thus different from Platypterygius and Ophthalmosaurus natans, where it was U-shaped. Below the supraoccipital were the two exoccipitals, which formed the sides of the foramen magnum, the canal for the spinal cord. Further below, and forming the floor of the foramen magnum, was the basioccipital. The midline canal that formed this floor was bordered by ridges, giving a bilobed appearance when seen from above, which is regarded an autapomorphy of the genus. Below the foramen magnum, the basioccipital formed the occipital condyle to connect with the first vertebra of the neck, forming the head joint. The occipital condyle was well demarcated from the remainder of the bone by a constricted band, unlike in most other ophthalmosaurids. The condyle was rounded and had visible growth rings, as in related genera. The opisthotics, which sat at both sides of the basioccipital, had extensions pointing backwards and upwards, the paroccipital processes. These processes were elongated and slender in Acamptonectes and Ophthalmosaurus icenicus, but short and stout in other ophthalmosaurids. The dentary, the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw, was elongated, straight, and had a blunt front tip, contrasting with the downturned and beak-like tips of some platypterygiines. The splenial bones expanded hindwards in depth to form the lower border of the mandible and much of its midline surface. The fossa dentalis was equivalent to the groove that ran parallel with the upper tooth row, and similar in morphology. Two Acamptonectes specimens lacked the “3”-shaped upper surface of the angular bones otherwise typical of ophthalmosaurids, instead having a simple, flat groove bordered by two walls. But since the \\"3\\" shape is present in the holotype specimen, this feature may have been variable between individuals or growth stages. The articular bone in one specimen was stouter than in other ophthalmosaurids, nearly as thick as long. The roots of the teeth were striated at their bases, and some were roughly quadrangular, as in many other ophthalmosaurids, but not square-shaped as in Platypterygius. Some of the roots of SNHM1284-R had resorption pits, indicating it was still growing teeth. The size of the only known complete tooth crown was relatively small compared to other ophthalmosaurids, slender, and sharply pointed, similar to the hind teeth of Baptanodon. The basal two thirds of the crown had subtle, longitudinal ridges, and was covered in a coarse texture, finer than in Aegirosaurus and some Platypterygius secimens. The base of the crown was slightly bulbous and almost smooth, unlike in other ophthalmosaurids. Postcranial skeleton Distinguishing vertebral features; proportionally large neural spine in a dorsal of SNHM1284-R (A), square shape of caudals in same specimen (B), curved lamellae in dorsals of the holotype (C), and cross-section of a rib of NHMUK R11185 (D), showing robusticity and a small groove As is typical for ichthyosaurs, the vertebral centra are disc-shaped and deeply concave on both ends. Processes (bony projections for muscle and rib attachment) are greatly reduced as an adaptation for the fully aquatic lifestyle. In Acamptonectes, the frontmost cervical centra (of the neck) were high and short, while the following cervical and dorsal (of the trunk) centra become progressively longer. At the rear section of the dorsal vertebral column, the centra become shorter and higher, a trend that reaches its peak at the first caudal (tail vertebrae), which is 3.12 times as high as long. The remaining caudals become longer and lower again, and the caudals that formed the fin are as long as high, a condition which is known in only one other species, Platypterygius platydactylus. The first two cervicals, the atlas and axis, are fused together to a single complex, which is wide in rear view. The front section of the dorsal (trunk) vertebral column have the diapophyses (bony sidewards projections) fused to their vertebrae; this also occurs in some other ophthalmosaurids. The centra of the dorsal vertebrae were distinct in being tightly interlocking and having extensive posterolateral lamella. In combination with the strong occiput of the skull, this interlocking resulted in a stiffening of the front section of the vertebral column. Such stiffening can be observed in other thunnosaurian ichthyosaurs, though not to the degree seen in Acamptonectes. The neural arches of the vertebrae feature narrow pre- and postzygapophyses (articular processes) that are unpaired (fused into a single element) in the whole vertebral column; this is in contrast to Platypterygius hercynicus and Sveltonectes, where these processes are paired in the front part of the column. The neural spines (upwards projections) are of variable height; in some dorsals they are markedly longer, reaching 1.25 times the height of the largest centrum. These long spines may comprise an additional element, the extraneural process, which has been described for Stenopterygius and is located above the neural spines. The top surface of the neural spines is typically pitted, indicating a cartilage covering. The ribs are distinct in being robust with a round cross-section, in contrast to the \\"8\\"-shaped cross-section seen in other thunnosaurian ichthyosaurs. Classification Basioccipitals from the occiputs of SNHM1284-R (A-F) and the holotype (G-H); extracondylar area is labelled as eca In 2012, Fischer and colleagues found Acamptonectes to be a member of the family Ophthalmosauridae based on several characteristics: the reduced extracondylar area (a band of bone surrounding the occipital condyle), the plate-like dorsal trochanter of the humerus, the presence of a facet at the front of the humerus' bottom end for a paddle bone, and the lack of notching in the paddle bones (the latter was considered to be homoplastic, or independently acquired). They also found it to be more closely related to other ophthalmosaurids than Arthropterygius based on the large processes of the basipterygoids (also bones of the braincase), the lack of a peg on the basioccipital, and the large trochanters of the femur. Relationships within the Ophthalmosauridae have historically been unstable in analyses due to the fragmentary nature of many ophthalmosaurid specimens; furthermore, many ophthalmosaurid genera are known from a single specimen. However, removal of these fragmentary genera has degraded the resolution of analyses even further. The phylogenetic analysis conducted by Fischer and colleagues in 2012 recovered two novel clades (groups) within the Ophthalmosauridae, the Ophthalmosaurinae and Platypterygiinae, which had been long suspected by ichthyosaur researchers (with Maxim Arkhangelsky having named the clades as subfamilies in 2001) but received no support from prior analyses. Acamptonectes was placed in the former, although it represented a secondary reversal of the group's only uniting characteristic (a notch on the bottom of the basioccipital). Left prootic bone of two Acamptonectes specimens (A-E) compared with those of other ophthalmosaurids (F-I) Within the Ophthalmosaurinae, various positions have been recovered for Acamptonectes due to the same issues. In 2012, Fischer and colleagues found that it grouped closest with \\"Ophthalmosaurus\\" natans, with Ophthalmosaurus icenicus and Mollesaurus being progressively less closely related. The former clade was on account of the reduced presence of striations on the teeth, although Fischer and colleagues indicated that this characteristic was homoplastic. Thus, they did not consider it sufficient to resurrect the previously-used name Baptanodon for \\"O.\\" natans. In 2013, they recovered the same arrangement in a derivative analysis for the description of Malawania, as did palaeontologist Nikolay Zverkov and colleagues in a 2015 analysis focusing on Grendelius (albeit with a clade consisting of Cryopterygius, Undorosaurus, and Paraophthalmosaurus being closer to Acamptonectes than Mollesaurus). Arkhangelsky and Zverkov previously found all of these species (with the exception of Mollesaurus) to form an unresolved clade, or polytomy, in 2014. A 2019 analysis by Zverkov and Vladimir Efimov found an otherwise identical arrangement where the positions of Mollesaurus and Acamptonectes were exchanged, which was also found in another 2019 analysis from Zverkov and Natalya Prilepskaya. In their description of Acuetzpalin, a 2020 analysis by Jair Barrientos-Laraa and Jesús Alvarado- Ortega found \\"O.\\" natans and O. icenicus to form a clade to the exclusion of Mollesaurus and then Acamptonectes. Alternatively, a 2014 analysis by Aubrey Roberts and colleagues in the description of Janusaurus found Acamptonectes as the sister group to a clade consisting of O. icenicus and Leninia, which collectively constituted one branch of the Ophthalmosaurinae. The same arrangement was recovered by a 2017 analysis conducted by Lene Delsett and colleagues, in the description of Keilhauia. In 2019, another analysis from the same authors found Acamptonectes closer to Janusaurus, Keilhauia, and Palvennia than Paraophthalmosaurus, \\"O.\\" natans (as Baptanodon), O. icenicus, or Gengasaurus (progressively closer to the base of the Ophthalmosaurinae in that order). However, in each case, the Bremer support of the groupings (a measure of the likelihood of a phylogenetic tree's arrangement over alternatives) was low. Other analyses still found Acamptonectes as part of polytomies. For the 2016 description of Muiscasaurus, Erin Maxwell and colleagues found O. icenicus, \\"O.\\" natans, Undorosaurus, and Acamptonectes in a polytomy at the base of the Ophthalmosauridae. Contrary to most analyses, they did not recover a distinct Ophthalmosaurinae. Also in 2016, Fischer and colleagues found Ophthalmosaurinae to consist of Mollesaurus as the sister group to a polytomy including O. icenicus, \\"O.\\" natans, Leninia, Acamptonectes, and a group containing Cryopterygius, Janusaurus, and Palvennia. In 2019, Maxwell, Dirley Cortés, Pedro Patarroyo, and Parra Ruge found a poorly-resolved Ophthalmosauridae containing Acamptonectes in a large polytomy. Finally, in the 2020 description of Arthropterygius thalassonotus, Lisandro Campos and colleagues found Acamptonectes in a polytomy with O. icenicus, Leninia, and Athabascasaurus, which formed the sister group to a clade of Keilhauia and Undorosaurus; the base of the Ophthalmosaurinae was formed by a polytomy of Baptanodon, Gengasaurus, and the other species. Right opisthotics of three Acamptonectes specimens (A-G) compared with those of other ophthalmosaurids (H-J) The phylogenetic tree produced by the analysis of Barrientos-Laraa and Alvarado-Ortega in 2020 is reproduced below. Palaeobiogeography Reconstructed skeleton of the closely related Ophthalmosaurus, Natural History Museum, London Ichthyosaurs were traditionally thought to have been affected by three extinction events: one at the Triassic–Jurassic boundary, one at the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary, and a final extinction in the Cretaceous at the boundary of the Cenomanian and Turonian ages that left no survivors. Some researchers suggested that their species diversity declined after the mid-Jurassic, with the ichthyosaurs lingering on until they disappeared at the end of the Cenomanian. This decline was thought to have been associated with a transition in the dominant ichthyosaur lineage: the large-eyed, thunniform (tuna-shaped) ophthalmosaurines, which were successful and widespread notwithstanding their hyperspecialization, would have been replaced by the more generalized platypterygiines, which had smaller eyes and longer bodies. Acamptonectes is a significant find in that it is an ophthalmosaurine from the Early Cretaceous, demonstrating that the ophthalmosaurines were not entirely wiped out at the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary. Fischer and colleagues also found evidence of other ophthalmosaurines in the Early Cretaceous by reanalyzing known material; this included a basoccipital and humerus from Berriasian-aged rocks near Nettleton, Lincolnshire that they referred to Ophthalmosaurus itself. Additionally, they pointed to reports of the Late Jurassic-aged platypterygiines Brachypterygius, Aegirosaurus, Caypullisaurus, and Yasykovia (which has been synonymized with Nannopterygius) from the Early Cretaceous. Lastly, by tabulating the number of genera disappearing in each age, Fischer and colleagues found that no boundary existed between ages from the Late Jurassic (Oxfordian) to Early Cretaceous (Aptian) that could be considered an extinction event for ophthalmosaurids; in particular, the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary had a net extinction rate of 0 and even the highest survival rates. (However, by counting the number of new clades that emerged, they found that the cladogenesis rate was lower in the Cretaceous.) Thus, they concluded—contrary to traditional thinking—that the Jurassic-Cretaceous extinction event had a negligible impact on ichthyosaurs compared to other marine reptiles, with ophthalmosaurids having remained diverse until their final extinction. Palaeobiology Forefin elements of NBM1284-R (A–D) and the holotype (E–G) With their dolphin-like bodies, ichthyosaurs were better adapted to an aquatic environment than any other group of marine reptiles. They were viviparous (gave birth to live young) and likely incapable of leaving the water. As homeotherms with high metabolic rates, ichthyosaurs would have been active swimmers. Jurassic and Cretaceous ichthyosaurs, including Acamptonectes, had evolved thunniform (tuna-like) swimming, as opposed to the anguilliform (undulating) mode of locomotion employed by earlier species. Thunniform ichthyosaurs were able to swim faster and more efficiently than other marine reptiles of similar sizes, and better adapted to a pelagic lifestyle. This method of swimming was aided by their more compact bodies and crescent-shaped caudal fins. Most of the skeleton of Acamptonectes appears to have been unusually rigid, which would have in effect severely limited the amount of side-to-side motion possible in the front part of the skeleton. Its snout was also shallower than in related species, and its ribs were more rounded in cross-section, which may have been a further adaptation to increase the stiffness of the animal's body, as they were likely more resistant to bending, according to the palaeontologist Darren Naish, one of the describers. The tightly packed occipital bones and cervical vertebrae would have allowed little movement in the neck, indicating it must have \\"shot through the water like a dart\\", according to palaeontologist Ulrich Joger, one of the describers. Diet and feeding As an ophthalmosaurine, Acamptonectes would likely have been an opportunistic generalist. Like other ichthyosaurs, it was a predator and probably fed on fish and squid. Their adaptations to speed suggests that these ichthyosaurs were pursuit predators. In 2012, the palaeontologist Maria Zammit suggested that the slender, shallow snout and tooth morphology of Acamptonectes indicated it had a different diet and lifestyle from other known Cretaceous ichthyosaurs. The slender tooth crowns with longitudinal ridges may have been used to impale rather than grasp prey, and its diet may have consisted of fleshy prey without a hard exterior. Icthyosaurs have been divided into \\"feeding guilds\\", and other examples include species that \\"pierced\\" small prey with needle-like teeth, and species that \\"crunched\\" hard-shelled prey with their more robust teeth. Ichthyosaurs had the largest eyes of any know vertebrate group, and would therefore have possessed good low-light vision. This would have aided with prey capture at great depths. In the related genus Ophthalmosaurus, the maximum diameter of the eyeball would have been , allowing for the detection of movement at depths of , in the mesopelagic zone. Ophthalmosaurus could likely dive for around 20 minutes, and reach depths of or more. In addition to good eyesight, the enlarged olfactory region of the brain indicates a good sense of smell. Palaeoecology Inccomplete holotype basicranium and interclavicle of Ichthyosaurus brunsvicensis, a possible Acamptonectes specimen from Germany destroyed during WW2 SNHM1284-R, the German specimen of Acamptonectes, comes from late Hauterivian rocks of the Lower Saxony Basin, near Cremlingen in eastern Lower Saxony. The Lower Cretaceous sediments of this basin are rich in siliclastic rocks, which were deposited in the southern region of the proto- North Sea, an epicontinental sea covering much of Northwest Germany during the Lower Cretaceous. Since this region linked the warmer Tethys Sea and the colder Boreal Realm, its environment was strongly susceptible to change. The late Hauterivian rocks of the region were deposited in the neritic zone, during a time of altering marine transgression and regression. The surface waters were generally cool, although they sometimes increased in temperature when warmer water from the Tethys Sea entered the region. Sedimentation rates were high, and the bottom waters were rather anoxic. Organisms that inhabited this sea include dinoflagellates, ammonites, and belemnites. Speeton Clay Acamptonectes is also known from Hauterivian rocks in the Speeton Clay Formation of England, within the holotype coming from the D2D beds, and the specimen NHUMK R11185 coming from the slightly older D2C beds. Material preserved in these sediments is sometimes reworked from the older Valanginian rocks below instead of actually coming from the Hauterivian. The holotype of Acamptonectes is partially articulated, as were some nearby crinoid fossils, however, indicating that Acamptonectes genuinely came from the Hauterivian. The Speeton Clay Formation is composed of claystone and mudrock and is generally about thick. The δ13C levels in the Speeton Clay Formation increase during the Valanginian and continue to do so during the early Hauterivian. This is likely due to rising sea levels, as submerged land released carbon into the oceans, although the amount of δ18O increases during this time, indicating an episode of cooling. δ18O levels in belemnite fossils indicate that the temperature of the Speeton clay was about at the beginning of the Hauterivian, but increased to during the middle part of this stage, reverting back to by its end. Evidence of photosynthetic organisms indicate that the Speeton Clay environment was at least partially located in the photic zone. Numerous other organisms have been recovered from the Speeton Clay Formation. Many of these were borers, including foraminiferans, fungi, chlorophyte algae, and a variety of animals, such as sponges, polychaetes, brachiopods, barnacles, bivalves, and echinoids. In addition to the aforementioned crinoids, invertebrates in the Speeton Clay Formation are also represented by a wide variety of ammonites and belemnites. While fossil fish are known from the Speeton Clay, they are poorly preserved and not very abundant. These fish include both bony fish and cartilaginous fish, the latter group represented by sharks and rays of various types. Marine reptiles are uncommon in this formation, and, besides Acamptonectes are represented by some fragmentary plesiosaur remains.

He is mostly known for his 22-year-old governorship of the Kerman Province (1803-1824).  Life  Ebrahim Khan was from the Qawanlu (also spelled Qoyunlu) branch of the Qajar family; he was the son of Mehdi-Qoli Khan, who was the brother of the Qajar ruler Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, and thus a paternal uncle of Fath-Ali Shah. Ebrahim Khan's mother was Asia Khanum, who was daughter of a certain Mohammad Khan Qawanlu. The date of Ebrahim Khan's birth is unknown, but he is known to have been a child when his father died during the siege of Astarabad in 1783 by the Zand ruler Karim Khan. After the early death of Ebrahim Khan's father, Agha Mohammad Khan married his mother, and then treated and raised Ebrahim Khan as one of his own sons along with his two nephews Fath-Ali Shah and Hosayn-Qoli Khan. In 1791, Ebrahim Khan married Fath-Ali Shah's eldest daughter Homayun Soltan. On 17 June 1797, Agha Mohammad Khan died and was succeeded by Fath-Ali Shah, who held Ebrahim Khan highly esteem and gave him the honorific title of \\"Zahir od-Dowleh\\" and \\"Ebrahim Khan-e Amu\\". Ebrahim was around this time appointed as the governor of Khorasan. In 1803, Ebrahim Khan was appointed as the governor of Kerman, a region which had been subject to destruction by Agha Mohammad Khan and was troubled by the local rulers of the province. Ebrahim Khan greatly paid respect the province, and in the words of Mehrnoush Soroush, \\"undertook a comprehensive restoration plan and was remarkably successful in reconstructing socio-economic infrastructure and maintaining the political stability of Kerman and its surrounding regions.\\" He also requested Fath-Ali Shah to temporally free the province from tax in order to restore the economy of the province. Furthermore, Ebrahim Khan also successfully fought against the local rulers of the region, and thus secured the province from trouble, which the province able to resume trade. However, Ebrahim Khan also needed great manpower in order to restore the economy of the province, but because of the great population loss of the province during the campaigns of Agha Mohammad Khan, Ebrahim Khan was forced to ask for help from the inhabitants of the provinces close to Kerman, and managed to make many resettle in Kerman. Furthermore, he patronized Islamic schools and invited religious scholars from Khuzestan, Fars, and Khorasan. Some of these religious scholars were Shaikh Ne'mat-Allah Bahrayni, Shaikh Abd al-Hosayn Ahsa'i, Molla Ali A'ma, and Sayyed Kazem Rashti. Not only did he patronize religious scholars, but also did the same with poets, and himself made some poems under the pen name of Toghrol.  Death  In 1824, Ebrahim Khan appointed his eldest son Abbas-Qoli Mirza as his regent in Kerman and his other son Rostam Khan as his regent in Bam, and, like some other governors, went to Iranian capital of Tehran in order to take place in a certain event. However, during his stay in Tehran, he died of illness.

After playing for a decade in Brooklyn, New York in the indie rock scene, he was signed to ECR Music Group in 2008. He released his debut album as a singer-songwriter with Unhand Me, You Fiend! in 2009. The album peaked at No. 1 on eMusic's Album Charts, and according to a review, \\"took the indie rock scene by storm.\\" His second album, I Could Disappear, included solo versions of his debut album, with Cloyd on vocals, piano, and guitar. Cloyd released a cover of Paul McCartney's 1971 song \\"Dear Boy\\" in September 2011. As of 2012, he is Executive Vice President of Creative Operations at ECR Music Group. Early life, career David Cloyd was born in 1974 in Wilmington, Ohio. A multi- instrumentalist, he has stated he didn't write much music when he was younger, becoming a singer-songwriter only later in his life. He began attending the College of Fine Arts at the University of Texas at Austin in 1994, where he majored in music performance. After graduating in 1998 he moved from Austin, Texas to Brooklyn, New York. He began working at EMI Music Publishing after winning the first internship with the Joni Abbott Foundation. People involved in the internship included executives Rick Krim and Evan Lamberg at EMI, Don Henley, Tom Freston of MTV, and John Sykes of VH1, who started the Save The Music Foundation. He met his wife, Jaime Herbeck, in April 2006. Herbeck, who was then a managing editor at Hyperion Books (and later Picador), was born in 1977. Cloyd played regularly in New York's indie rock scene, but his band broke up in early 2007. At that point he had written a number of songs, a process which he had started in earnest in late 2006. Cloyd, who lived with his wife in a tiny apartment in Brooklyn's Sunset Park, had no excess funds for studio time. He created his own 9x9 foot studio in his apartment, and used a homebuilt computer, two cheap monitors, a condensor microphone, an electric and acoustic guitar, a bass guitar, a keyboard, two amplifiers, and a drum machine to begin creating an album. He borrowed an amp from friend and neighbor Shara Worden, who had previously given him vocal lessons. They had also shared band members in earlier groups, including Konrad Meissner, who now plays with Matt Nathanson. Cloyd's homemade recordings were discovered by Blake Morgan of ECR Music Group (Engine Company Records). Morgan began helping set deadlines for Cloyd to finish tracks in his home studio, and began mixing the recordings. He has stated \\"[Cloyd] was actually in the perfect environment, at the perfect time. I didn´t want him to change the way he was working, or how, I just wanted him to keep going.\\" In May 2008, Cloyd and his wife moved to Buffalo, New York, Herbeck's hometown. Cloyd began to teach music lessons and continued work on his debut album. Solo career Unhand Me, You Fiend! (2009) Cloyd's debut album, Unhand Me, You Fiend! was released on January 20, 2009 on ECR Music Group. He composed, performed, and engineered all tracks on the LP, and co-produced the album with Blake Morgan. Morgan mixed and edited, and Phil Nicolo mastered the album at Studio 4 in Philadelphia. The album included Cloyd's cover of Radiohead's \\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\\" from In Rainbows as a bonus track. Following its release worldwide, the album peaked at No. 1 on eMusic's Album Charts. According to a review, the album \\"took the indie rock scene by storm.\\" In October 2009, he was selected as the winner of the \\"Artvoice Battle of Original Music\\" by Art Voice, where he competed against the Bear Exchange. =Reception= His vocals on the album were compared to David Berkeley and Jeff Buckley. Also, \\"The often densely layered music has echoes of the Beatles, Matthew Sweet and Elliott Smith, and stylistically sits comfortably among the work of contemporaries like Rufus Wainwright, Duncan Sheik and Kevin Tihista’s Red Terror.\\" Another review stated that Cloyd \\"uses this album to convey the struggles of everyday life.\\" eMusic wrote \\"Having recently departed New York City for Buffalo, you can almost hear the isolation in David Cloyd's debut. Unhand Me, You Fiend! jumps between folky, Jeff Buckley-esque ballads, minor- key raucous indie-guitar workouts and, errr, a Radiohead cover (that's actually quite great!). It seems the work of a single, quirky mind with a lot of time on its hands — and it's a joy to listen to.\\" Melodic.net gave it 4/4 stars and wrote \\"New talent David Cloyd...offers a stylish and at times complex pop journey. With floating melodies built with acoustic elements and technical details... if you like cool pop in a slightly odd and very personal style, this is a must album.\\" I Could Disappear (2010) On June 29, 2010, Cloyd released his second album, I Could Disappear. The nine studio tracks are all solo reworkings of the original pop and rock songs from his debut album. According to Cloyd, \\"With each song boiled down to its essence I discovered something exciting—working with less demands more from you as an artist.\\" He performed vocals, alternating with piano and electric guitar. He also engineered the album and created the album cover. Dear Boy (2011) Cloyd released a cover of Paul McCartney's 1971 song \\"Dear Boy\\" on September 13, 2011. ECR Music Group released it in digital format only. As of 2011 he is Executive Vice President at ECR Music Group, and also continues to produce music for other musicians.

Colonel Jhr. Bodo Sandberg (September 23, 1914 - May 2, 2005) was a fighter pilot in the Royal Netherlands Air Force and 'Engelandvaarder' during World War II. He was awarded the Cross of Merit and the Airman's Cross for his bravery during the German invasion of May 1940. Sandberg died on May 2, 2005 in Bentveld, Netherlands. Biography On August 26, 1939 Bodo Sandberg made the first successful belly landing in Dutch history Bodo Sandberg was born in Rotterdam on September 23, 1914. From early childhood he wanted to fly so much that, at the age of 16, he built his own airplane. He had no money for an engine so he built himself a glider. When he finished it, a friendly pilot in an old bi-plane on a local airfield pulled him up in the air and he flew. In those early days you couldn't just become a pilot. If you wanted to fly you had to join the Air Force. And so he did. On August 26, 1939, Sandberg made history in Dutch aviation: he made the first successful belly landing. On May 13, 1940, three days after the Germans had invaded the Netherlands, Sandberg was called into action. Because the Nazis had destroyed almost all the planes of the Dutch Air Force, Sandberg had to fly one of the few Fokker G-I fighters that were still airworthy. Along with one other G-1 fighter, he had to protect the last Dutch bomber, a Fokker T-5, against a deluge of German Messerschmitt aircraft. The small squadron's task was to bomb the Moerdijkbruggen(Moerdijk bridges), the Netherlands' largest bridges over the wide estuary of the Haringvliet, to hold back the German invasion. Just beyond Dordrecht, the squadron was attacked by nine Messerschmitt fighters, three of which attacked the T-5. The other six split up and attacked the two G-1s. The T5 went down in flames and crashed in the Grienden along the Noord, near Ridderkerk. The other G-1 was also shot down and crashed in a polder at Nieuw-Lekkerland. Pilot Sgt. Paul Schoute perished in the violently burning wreck. Hans Lindner was thrown out of the plane and ended up against the verge of a waterway with his leg shot off. His hair still burning. Someone rushed to help him, extinguished it with water from the canal, but he died shortly thereafter. Only one G-1 fighter plane, in this mission that was so vital in Holland's desperate defense against the Nazi invaders, managed to outfly the onslaught of the German Messerschmits. Shot by the machine guns from the Messerschmits, Sandberg was bleeding from bullet holes through his leather pilot's jacket, but he found a cloud in the air in which he could hide and, thanks to that cloud, he managed to escape from the German attackers. Not for long though, as his plane had taken fire as well and he could not make it back to base. But luck was with him again. He managed to keep his damaged plane in the air long enough to find a highway near the Hague where he could make an emergency landing. It was a close call but Sandberg and his crew-member v.d. Breemer survived this mission. They were the only two. Escape to England and fighting on two fronts Immediately after the German invasion Sandberg tried to escape from the Nazi occupied Netherlands to reach England from where he could continue his fight against the invaders. His first attempt was with four others (Ch. A. den Hoed, G. Reels, E.A. Plate and J. Versteegh). On their way through Belgium, France and Spain to Portugal (from where they could fly to England), they made it as far as Poligny, just east of Paris, but there they were betrayed and arrested. They ended up in a German prisoner of war camp outside Lyon. However, they escaped from that prison camp by stealing the camp commander's car. They were starved and sick, but all five made it back to the Netherlands. Sandberg, however, didn't give up and made a second attempt. This time he escaped from the Nazi occupied Netherlands with three fellow fighter pilots from the Dutch Air Force Jan Bosch, Faam Janssens and A.C.H. Kanters, and this time they made it, all the way to England. From England Bodo was sent to the USA where in 1944 he trained on US fighter planes (the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk) at the Royal Netherlands Military Flying-School in Jackson, Mississippi. After completing his training, he was sent to Australia and New Guinea in the South Pacific, where he fought against the Japanese. As the Second World War was entering its final and fiercest phase, Bodo Sandberg came home to the Netherlands from the USA, Australia and New Guinea, albeit for a fleeting moment, as he was sent out into action again, this time to Dutch Indonesia, Singapore and Ceylon (now Malaysia). In February 1946 he flew from Batavia (now Jarakrta), via Singapore to Penang where he worked with Peter Tazelaar, one of the Netherlands’ most heroic resistance fighters and fellow \\"Engelandvaarder\\". In 1947 Bodo was awarded the “Ereteken voor Orde en Vrede 1947” for his contributions to the Netherlands' efforts to re-establish peace and order in Dutch-Indonesia after the Japanese capitulation. Jhr. Bodo Sandberg fought enemy action on two fronts, survived it all, and lived to be 90. Sandberg was awarded the Cross of Merit and the Airman's Cross, both Knight’s Orders, by H.R.H. Wilhelmina, Queen of the Netherlands. After the war After the war, Bodo stayed active in the Dutch Air Force as a fighter pilot and flight instructor. He was Commander of a squadron of Supermarine Spitfires in the Dutch Air Force Base “Soesterberg”. After Sandberg was injured in a crash with a Spitfire at Soesterberg, Sandberg became Air Attaché for the four Nordic countries in the Dutch Embassy in Oslo, Norway. Sandberg completed his more than 30 year Air Force career as Commander of the Dutch Air Force Base Ypenburg.  Private life  Sandberg married Catharina Elisabeth (Lies) Sandberg-Brugsma in Haarlem, the Netherlands, on November 23, 1939. They had two sons, Jhr. Steven W.H. Sandberg (Haarlem, August 25, 1940 - Aerdenhout, March 18, 2016) and Jhr. Job B.B. Sandberg (Job Sandberg), Haarlem, March 23, 1946.

He is most recognized as the first major benefactor of Scouting by donating Gilwell Park in 1919.  Publisher, expert in rubber  Frontispiece of The Rubber Tree Book, published 1913, Maclaren and Sons, London William Frederick de Bois Maclaren was born on 17 November 1856, in Blythswood, Glasgow in Scotland, as the son of Walter Gray McLaren (Master Printer, sometimes misspelt as painter) and Caroline Amelia De Bois, from France. He had an elder sister Margaret Ann Aitken McLaren (born 25 April 1855), and younger brothers Walter Gray (born 14 April 1858, attended Glasgow University, ordained 1885 in New Zealand where he lived until 1903, died 1916 in Glasgow), Charles (born 19 November 1859) and John (born 28 June 1861). By the beginning of the 20th century, Maclaren and Frank Copeman were sole partners of Maclaren & Sons Ltd, 37–38 Shoe Lane, London, in the Fleet Street neighbourhood, who were publishers or publishers' agents of industrial books and magazines, such as The Brick and Pottery Trades Journal, and Ceylon Observer, and publishers of household titles, under the name of The British Baker, such as All About Pastries. One of their periodicals was the India Rubber Journal, the leading publication for the flourishing rubber industry in the beginning of the 20th century, with Sir Herbert Wright as editor for the period 1907–1917. Copeman and Maclaren founded in 1906 the Rubber Estate Agency. It was the first UK company for the specific purpose of financing the acquisition of rubber estates and of acting as secretaries and agents of rubber and other plantation companies. With this expertise in the rubber industry, Maclaren wrote and published The Rubber Tree Book (Maclaren and Sons, London, 1913, 384 pages), about technology and business administration of rubber plantations. In 1919, the Rubber Estate Agency was sold to the Belgium company Societé Internationale de Plantations et de Finance (SIPEF). The R.E.A. company still exists, and was worth approximately GBP 37 million in 2010. Maclaren wrote several other books including Climbs and Changes, Chuckles from a Cheery Corner, and Word Pictures of War (a book of poetry based on experiences of the First World War, published by Methuen, London, in 1917). He died on 3 June 1921. Posthumously in 1922, his Child's Song-Story Book was published for private circulation by Blackie & Son, Glasgow. Could also be attributed to WFEdB Maclaren.  Scouting  On the recommendation of P.B. Nevill, acting on behalf of Baden-Powell, Maclaren purchased the 53 acre Gilwell Hall estate near Epping Forest near the town of Chingford for GBP 7,000, and presented it as Gilwell Park to the Scout Association in July 1919. For reference, the GBP 7,000 in 1919 equals GBP 1 million in 2010 value. Maclaren also paid another GBP 3,000 to help put the White House into good repair, as the place had been abandoned for the previous 14 years and was virtually derelict. When Gilwell Park was officially opened on 26 July 1919 Mrs Maclaren cut ribbons in Scout colours (green and yellow) that were hung across the doorway to the White House to mark the opening. Baden-Powell then presented Maclaren with the Silver Wolf as a sign of the great debt that the Movement owed to him. In Maclaren's honour the Gilwell staff wore the Maclaren neckerchief, made of Maclaren tartan. However to reduce the expense, a scarf of dove grey cloth (the colour of humility) with a warm red lining (to signify warmth of feeling) was substituted with only a patch of Maclaren tartan on the point of the scarf and worn by those passing the Gilwell practical course. In 1924 use of the scarf became restricted to Wood Badge holders only. Today the scarf is more the earth tone colour beige than grey.

She has won the Desmond Elliott Prize, Betty Trask Award and the Jerwood Fiction Uncovered Prize. Life McCleen was brought up in a fundamentalist Christian sect in Wales and for most of her childhood did not have much contact with outsiders. McCleen went to the University of Oxford to read English Literature aged 22.. She later completed a MA, also in English Literature, at the University of York. She experienced opposition from her religious community to her decision to attend university. \\"It was an enormous step and one I almost didn't take, and one I felt bad about taking for many years afterwards, until I realised I hadn't done anything wrong.\\" After graduation she experienced a mental breakdown and suffered from tinnitus and Chronic fatigue syndrome. During her illness, she wrote \\"a long novel. It didn’t work and from that novel came three novels\\". McCleen has said that she will not continue to write fiction. \\"Writing is really destructive to me.\\" \\"I feel it's sort of like a knife in me\\". She may, however, continue to write poetry. In 2016 McCleen was writer in residence at the Brontë Parsonage Museum, and in 2017 she was writer in residence at the Manchester Centre for New Writing at the University of Manchester. McCleen is also a musician, singer and songwriter. She writes occasionally for The Guardian.

The writing is born of a genuine inquiry into the nature of religious belief, especially as it relates to one’s psychological development\\". Chris Cleave in The Financial Times called the book \\"loveable, unique and thrillingly uncategorisable ... an extraordinary and peculiarly haunting novel.’ Colin Greenland, however, in The Guardian, felt that \\"the world outside is ... contrived and confused ... [and that this] perilously weakens [McCleen's] argument\\"., and Ron Charles, in The Washington Post, felt \\"Much of the language here is too flat and pedestrian. Other passages soar into flights of preciousness\\". The Professor of Poetry was described by Hilary Mantel as \\"an astonishing and luminous novel\\". Hepzibah Anderson in The Observer found \\"sentences here of such agile cleverness, charged with wit and beauty and enchantment.\\" Kate Clanchy, also in The Observer, however, found it \\"conservative and anti-feminist\\". Sam Kitchener in The Telegraph said of The Offering that \\"Huge questions, of faith, time, reality, individual responsibility and human sexuality are given pained and peculiar answers\\". Max Liu in The Independent wrote that \\"Some of the dense, descriptive passages are frustrating to read but difficulty is one of this novel’s enduring themes\\". Influences McCleen has said that she is influenced by Marilynne Robinson, Cormac McCarthy, W.G. Sebald, Thomas Mann, Virginia Woolf, Emily Dickinson, T.S.

Petersen was born June 20, 1922, in a logging camp near Elk, Mendocino County, California, and grew up in nearby Fort Bragg, California. He enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II, after which he received an associate degree from Santa Rosa Junior College in 1948 and a J.D. from the University of San Francisco in 1951. After working in a private practice and the county district attorney's office, he became the district attorney for Mendocino County in 1960. During his term as D.A., he became embroiled in a controversy called the \\"War of the Warrants\\" that began with a domestic abuse case, led to the issuance of 57 arrest warrants, and ended with the conviction of four people, two of them sitting judges, for obstruction of justice.. In 1962, Petersen ran for office as a California State Senator for California's 4th State Senate district, which at that time covered both Mendocino and Lake Counties. Despite the attempts of the judges in the War of the Warrants to embarrass him during his campaign, he won election and served until 1966. He succeeded Waverly Jack Slattery as state senator, and in turn was succeeded by John F. McCarthy. His actions as state senator included the opening of Hendy Woods State Park, an old-growth coast redwood forest in Mendocino County.. Petersen's chances of remaining in the senate were damaged in the 1965 redistricting process, and in June 1966, governor Pat Brown appointed Petersen as judge for the Superior Court for Del Norte County, succeeding Michael H. Messner in that position.. Among the cases he heard was one in which the Pacific Lumber Company was sued for its clear cutting of old-growth redwoods.. In 1988, Petersen retired as a judge and soon after returned to private practice. However, he was recalled to the bench in 1993. He returned to Fort Bragg in his retirement, and died there on May 23, 2011.

In the course of one of his military campaigns, Rhesus heard of the beautiful Arganthone of Kios, who had no taste for indoor life and would instead spend her time hunting completely on her own, accompanied by no one other than her large pack of hounds. Eager to get to know her, Rhesus arrived at Kios and invited Arganthone to go hunting together, claiming that he too hated the company of men; she believed his words and sympathized with him. After they had spent some time together, Arganthone realized she had fallen in love with Rhesus and, despite initially being hesitant to confess her feelings, eventually did so and had her feelings answered, so that Rhesus eventually married her. Later on, the Trojan War broke out and Rhesus was asked to join in. Arganthone tried to dissuade her loved one from going to the war, as if she felt he would not return, but Rhesus hated the thought of being deemed unwarlike and did go.

Extremely destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States, Bangladesh, Brazil and Eastern India, but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also appear regularly in neighboring southern Canada during the Northern Hemisphere's summer season, and somewhat regularly in Europe, Asia, Argentina, and Australia. There were 939 tornadoes confirmed in the U.S. in 2012. Worldwide, 91 fatalities have been confirmed: 69 in the United States, six in Turkey, five each in China and Indonesia, three in New Zealand and one each in Italy, Japan and Poland. Synopsis Map of all killer tornadoes within the United States in 2012. Only affected counties with fatalities are highlighted along the tracks. The year began with an unusual number of tornadoes during January 2012. The first major tornado outbreak occurred on January 22–23, when a spring-like system moved across the southern Mississippi valley, producing at least two dozen confirmed tornadoes across Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Alabama. As a whole, January was the third most active on record, behind 1999 and 2008. Despite this, a significant contrast in activity occurred for the month of February. Despite a slow beginning, the month of February ended with a significant tornado outbreak on the 28th and 29th with a strong EF4 doing significant damage and killing eight in Harrisburg, Illinois. Another ramp-up in activity occurred in early March, with one of the largest outbreaks ever recorded in the United States for that time of the year. This outbreak produced 160 reported tornadoes, and affected areas across Indiana and Kentucky in particular. Using the adjusted preliminary tornado count (85% of the total preliminary reports in order to remove overcount), 2012 attained record tornado activity on March 23 with 319 reports, eclipsing the previous record of 317. A relative lull in tornado activity occurred in mid-March, but activity soon rose again by the end of the month when an EF2 killed one person on March 23 near Louisville, Kentucky. The beginning of April also started off active, with a tornado outbreak occurring in North Texas, including the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. An EF2 caused significant damage in the city of Arlington, where a state of disaster was declared. An EF3 also caused significant damage in Forney, Texas; despite this, no fatalities were reported throughout the outbreak. From April 13–16, an outbreak producing over 95 confirmed tornadoes swept across the Midwest, Kansas and Oklahoma in particular. A tornado emergency was issued for the city of Wichita late on April 14 as an EF3 moved across the southeastern portion of the city. A couple hours later, an EF3 in Oklahoma killed six people when it hit the city of Woodward just after midnight. One EF4 tornado was confirmed in Kansas on April 14, where it stripped trees of bark and destroyed a farmstead. On April 30, several tornadoes swept across Oklahoma and Kansas. By contrast, May was much quieter than usual for what is normally the most active month. Several minor outbreaks were spread around the month but no major outbreaks and no fatalities took place. June was also quiet, although there were a few small outbreaks. These included an EF2 on June 4 that caused three fatalities in Diehlstadt, Missouri and a small outbreak in Florida associated with Tropical Storm Debby that killed one person. The summer months were among the quietest on record as a persistent ridge prevented any significant storms from developing in the United States, as cooler air was unable to penetrate southward and was held into Canada (similar to February 2010 when warm air was suppressed into the Caribbean). July was very quiet with only 35 confirmed tornadoes. August and September were also generally very quiet as well, broken only by an active period after Hurricane Isaac made landfall, producing a sizable multi-day tornado outbreak. October continued to be quiet with only 30 confirmed tornadoes throughout the month. As of November 25, 2012 ranks as the quietest year for tornadoes in the United States, with an estimated 885 tornadoes, below the previous record minimum for that point in the year of 920 tornadoes. Unlike 2011, 2012 went without an EF5 tornado. Events United States yearly total January There were 97 tornadoes reported in the U.S. in January, of which 79 were confirmed. January 9–11 Radar image of the severe thunderstorm that spawned an EF1 tornado near Mission Bend, Texas on January 9. On the morning of January 9, a mid-level area of low pressure moved east-northeast across the Big Bend of Texas and triggered the development of a surface low in southeastern Texas before noon local time. Along the eastern side of this system, warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico was drawn northward and created an environment favoring supercell thunderstorms, though widespread clouds limited the extent of activity. A line of strong thunderstorms developed in southeastern Texas around 9:00 a.m. CST moved slowly eastward. Only isolated reports of damaging winds and a few tornadoes accompanied this line and no tornado or severe thunderstorm watches were issued. Five tornadoes touched down in association with this line of storms, one of which was an EF1 that caused significant damage to a home near Mission Bend, Texas. Developing into an upper-level system over the Ark-La-Tex region on January 10, the risk for more widespread severe weather was evident; however, only isolated reports were received that day. Continuing eastward, additional severe weather was expected along coastal North Carolina on January 11 before the system moved into the Atlantic Ocean. However, a severe storm developed in South Carolina and moved into western North Carolina, outside the area anticipated to support tornadoes, and soon spawned a tornado around 5:22 p.m. EST. Rated as a low-end EF2, the tornado tracked for and damaged or destroyed dozens of structures near Ellenboro. Ten people were injured by the storm. Continuing northeast, the thunderstorm spawned another, more intense EF2 tornado around 6:04 p.m. that caused extensive damage in the South Fork community. There, several mobile homes were completely destroyed and a few homes sustained significant damage. Eight people in the community were injured by the tornado. Another EF0 tornado touched down less than 20 minutes later before the event ended. January 17 As a line of intense thunderstorms moved southward throughout much of the Ohio River Valley and Southeast, many tornadoes were reported. The first tornado of the day occurred near Madison, Indiana, and was rated an EF0 on the Enhanced Fujita scale; only minor damage was reported. The second tornado occurred in Floyd County, Indiana, which destroyed portions of homes and trees; it was later rated an EF1. The third tornado touched down near Clarksville, Indiana, and was rated an EF0 due to the minor damage it caused. One of the first confirmed tornadoes on January 17 was an EF1 near St. Matthews, Kentucky, which injured a truck driver on I-265. The most significant tornado was an EF2 southwest of Scottsville, Kentucky that tore the roof from one home and destroyed numerous weaker structures. Another EF2 tornado destroyed a mobile home and badly damaged several permanent homes near Sandy Hook, Mississippi. A total of 14 tornado reports were called in this day. January 22–23 EF3 damage to a house in Center Point, Alabama. On January 22, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk for severe weather across parts of the Southern United States and Ohio Valley.

March 2–3 EF3 damage in downtown West Liberty, Kentucky. From March 2 to 3, a devastating and deadly outbreak of strong to violent tornadoes impacted the Southern United States and Ohio Valley. A moderate risk of severe weather was issued for March 2 a day in advance for a large area from near Tuscaloosa, Alabama to Dayton, Ohio as an intense storm system tracked across the region in a very highly sheared and unstable environment. On the morning of March 2, it was upgraded and a high risk of severe weather was issued for Middle Tennessee and central Kentucky, later extended into central and southern Indiana and southern Ohio, including a 30% hatched risk area for tornadoes. The Storm Prediction Center mentioned the potential for multiple long-tracked, violent tornadoes. Multiple PDS tornado watches were issued shortly thereafter. For only the second time in history (the first being April 27, 2011 for the 2011 Super Outbreak), Dr. Greg Forbes, severe weather expert for The Weather Channel, issued a TOR:CON (short for \\"tornado condition index\\", a scale to rate the risk of tornadic activity over a given region based on atmospheric conditions) rating of 10 out of 10; this time for the Louisville, Kentucky region and along the Ohio River of Indiana and Kentucky.

April 13–16 A large and violent EF4 tornado near Marquette, KS. An impressive low pressure area and associated trough began tracking into the Great Plains on April 13, and a slight risk of severe weather was issued. The outlook mentioned the possibility of tornadoes, including the risk for isolated strong tornadoes. No strong tornadoes occurred, though an EF1 tornado caused considerable damage in Norman, Oklahoma. For only the second time in history (previously for April 7, 2006), a day two high risk of severe weather was issued by the Storm Prediction Center. In the discussion, the SPC stated that a major tornado outbreak was likely across central Kansas and north- central Oklahoma during the afternoon and overnight hours of April 14, with long-tracked violent tornadoes likely. It was later expanded to include a second high risk area across much of Nebraska, where a rare 45% tornado probability was given during the late morning update on April 13. During the morning hours on the 14th, the high risk area was expanded again to combine the two separate areas into a single large one. Later in the day, the 45% tornado probability was shifted from Nebraska south to Kansas and northern Oklahoma. A large outbreak of tornadoes impacted the Great Plains states on April 14, and several PDS Tornado Warnings were issued during the outbreak. Initially, most of the tornadoes were small or remained over open country, though more significant tornado activity began to develop throughout the day.

A state and national representative forward, he played five Test matches for Australia, one as captain. Early life Hardcastle was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and attended The Scots College in Sydney.Howell pp124 He undertook medical studies at Sydney University in the years immediately before and during World War II and won university blues for rugby in 1937, 1939 and 1941. Representative rugby career His state representative debut was made for New South Wales in 1938. He was still playing for Sydney University and playing well when national representative fixtures restarted at the conclusion of World War II. He was selected on the first Australian post-war tour, the 1946 Wallaby tour of New Zealand captained by Bill McLean. He played in three Tests and seven tour matches proving his capability as a durable tight forward, formidable in the ruck. In 1947 he captained New South Wales to a victory over the touring All Blacks and was honoured with national captaincy in one of the Tests of that tour. He was vying against McLean for the tour captaincy of the 1947-48 Wallaby Tour and when Queensland won the interstate selection series that year, McLean was given the honour. Hardcastle played twenty-two matches on the tour including the final UK match against the Barbarians. He did not play in any Tests. He returned to the Test arena in 1949 playing against the New Zealand Māori in Sydney. His final representative appearance was for New South Wales in 1950 against the British Isles. Playing style Though a tall man Hardcastle was not a proficient jumper and often adopted spoiling tactics to prevent opposition locks getting above him in the line-out. The writer Howell toured and played alongside Hardcastle on the 1947-48 Tour and asserts that this habit led to various incidents when opposition forwards would get-square with Hardcastle to warn him off from holding them down in the jump. Howell also notes that Hardcastle had a lifelong stutter. This affected his ability to communicate quickly on-field but also led to an amusing incident on the 1947-48 tour when Hardcastle was nominated after the Swansea match to give the traditional visitor's response to the after-dinner speech. When tour manager Arnold Tancred called upon \\"the esteemed Dr Phil Hardcastle\\" to reply, Hardcastle got to his feet and said \\"Gee-gee-gee-gentlemen, w-w-words f-f-fail me\\" and sat down.

Game-Maker also was sold under various names by licensed distributors in the UK, Korea, and other territories including Captain GameMaker (Screen Entertainment, UK) and Create Your Own Games With GameMaker! (Microforum, Canada).G. Andrew Stone, \\"RSD GameMaker\\" Game-Maker is notable as one of the first complete game design packages for DOS-based PCs, for its fully mouse-driven graphical interface, and for its early support for VGA graphics, Sound Blaster sound, and full-screen four-way scrolling.DIYGamer, \\"The Original Game-Maker\\" Primary distribution for Game- Maker was through advertisements in the back of PC and game magazines such as Computer Gaming World Computer Gaming World, \\"Issue #114 (January 1994), page #209\\" and VideoGames & Computer Entertainment. At release Game-Maker was priced at $89, and shipped on 5.25\\" diskette with seven or eight demonstration or tutorial games. Later releases were less expensive, and shipped on CD-ROM with dozens of sample games and a large selection of extra tools and resources.DIYGamer, \\"The Game-Maker Archive – Part 14: Laser Light\\" After some consultation with the user base, on July 12, 2014 original coder Andy Stone released the Game-Maker 3.0 source code on GitHub, under the MIT license.G. Andrew Stone, \\"Recreational Software Design's GameMaker product, released in 1994\\"  Construction  Game-Maker consists of a text-mode wrapper, tying together a collection of WYSIWYG design tools. The tools produce proprietary resources that are compiled together and parsed with RSD's custom XFERPLAY game engine. The design tools include: * Palette Designer - for designing and editing custom 256-color .PAL palette files (for sprites, color #255 is clear) * Block Designer - for designing 20x20 pixel .BBL background tiles and .CBL/.MBL animation frames for characters and monsters * Character Maker - for animating and sequencing .CHR character sprites * Monster Maker - for animating and sequencing .MON \\"monster\\" (i.e., non-player) sprites * Map Maker - for designing 100x100 tile .MAP files (10 screens tall; 6-1/4 screens across) * Graphics Image Reader - for importing visuals from .GIF files, produced with external painting programs * Sound Designer - for designing PC speaker .SND files, assigning Sound Blaster .VOC samples, and formatting .CMF music files * Integrator - for compiling and organizing resources together into a playable .GAM file Game-Maker involves no scripting language; all design tools use a mouse-driven 320x200 VGA display, with a shared logic and visual theme. Users draw background tiles pixel by pixel in an enlarged window, and can pull tiles from the palette to arrange in a \\"sandbox\\" area. A further menu allows users to set physical properties—solidity, gravity, animation, various counter values—for each block. The user draws maps by pulling blocks from the palette and painting with them using simple paintbrush, line, shape, and fill tools. Characters can have up to 15 keyboard commands, plus idle, death, and injury animations. They can hold an inventory and money, earn score, gain and lose hit points and lives, and track several counters—often used for keys and similar functions. Monsters have simple animations and movements, and can also change behavior in response to the player. Playable games can be exported complete with a portable version of the XFERPLAY engine, sound drivers, and configuration files. All games record high scores and (in later versions) attract mode replays. All games also feature instant save and load, and support standard PC joysticks. In later versions of the software, games also can incorporate several formats including ASCII text data, CompuServe .GIF files, and Autodesk Animator .FLI animations into multimedia presentations during menus and between levels. Although Game-Maker includes no tools for developing these files, the formats are standardized enough to allow the user a choice of standalone utilities. In addition, image data produced with outside programs such as Deluxe Paint is easily imported and split into background tiles or sprites.  Game engine  Through RSD's proprietary XFERPLAY engine, all Game-Maker games run in 256-color full-screen VGA, at an eccentric 312x196 resolution (switching to the more standard 320x200 for menu screens). Game- Maker games are also distinguished by their eccentric 20x20 tile and sprite size (as opposed to the more standard 8x8 or 16/16 dimensions), populating a standard 100x100 tile (2000x2000 pixel) map size. Transition between scenes is achieved through a slow fade to or from black. All games share a common interface, with a menu screen offering six options: Play, Read Instructions, Read Storyline, See Credits, See Highest Scores, and Quit. Pressing F2 brings up an inventory screen, while F5 and F6 bring up save and load screens. Although most of these menus can be customized with .GIF backgrounds, their basic layout, labeling, and content are constant across all games. All games track player score, and display a high score table upon the game's end (whether through completion or failure). Later versions of Game-Maker allow multimedia sequences between levels, including .GIF images, .FLI animations, and ASCII text files. The engine allows one player at a time, with the screen automatically scrolling in any of the four cardinal directions when the character comes within 1/3 screen width or height of the screen's edge. All Game-Maker games lack an on-screen display (of hit points, score, lives, etc.), though much of this information can be tracked in the inventory screen.  History  G. Andrew Stone's Block Designer 3.00 Game-Maker developed from a series of modification tools for a top-down competitive maze game called Labyrinth,Gamasutra, \\"The Making and Unmaking of a Game-Maker Maker\\" designed by Andrew Stone in January 1991. Although the engine is different,Gamasutra, \\"Bonus Time with Andy Stone\\" Labyrinth shared code and file formats with the later XFERPLAY engine and graphical resources with several later first-party games. Whereas Labyrinth grew out of Andrew's interest in NetHack and Piers Anthony novels, one of Andrew's first goals was to expand his tools and engine to permit side-scrolling action-adventure games. \\"In fact, making something like Metroid was sort of the bar I set myself for version 1.0. Which is why I added the secret passage features, and gravity, early on.\\" In July 1991New Hampshire Department of State, Corporation Filings Andrew and his father G. Oliver Stone incorporated Recreational Software Designs to pursue Game-Maker as a business venture—with Oliver as president and Andrew as CEO. Through Oliver's business acumen RSD made deals with KD Software and GameLynk to distribute Game-Maker and host its online community. Through 1992-1994 RSD placed a series of full-sized ads (and some smaller sizes) in major computer magazines, and in 1994 they sub-leased a booth at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. At the time of Game-Maker's release the software was revolutionary both in concept and technology; although there were earlier game creation systems, Game-Maker was the first general-purpose graphical GCS for the dominant DOS/Windows-based PC. Throughout the design process Andrew was adamant that Game-Maker's tools remain entirely visual, involving absolutely no programming from the end user. Its engine also supported full-screen four- way VGA scrolling, and later full-screen double buffered redraws, well before these were the standard. Several updates followed over the next three years, adding Sound Blaster support, improving the design interface, and refining the game engine—yet many features kept being pushed back. Although his brother Oliver Jr. spent a summer on the project, and wrote the code for the sound and Monster editor, Andrew handled the bulk of the coding and updates — a task that, thanks to the lack of standardized drivers or libraries at that time, became all-encompassing and difficult to maintain. Over the software's lifetime Andrew found himself so \\"waylaid by video driver and [engine] problems\\" that he was unable to focus as much as he wanted on adding and refining features. By the mid-1990s the advent of 3D video cards and the introduction of Windows 95 meant that to keep up with the marketplace Game- Maker would need great changes both in concept and in coding. Furthermore the continued lack of standardization meant a large investment in coding ever more complicated drivers and libraries—work that would be thrown away as soon as standards were established. Despite plans for a radical professional-quality update, RSD ceased support for Game-Maker around 1995. In a 2011 interview Andrew mused about Game-Maker, stating that by his own principles he was surprised he hadn't released the source code years earlier. Later, on July 1, 2014, Andrew posted to the Game-Maker Facebook page, asking for community input on releasing the code.G. Andrew Stone, \\"Facebook Game-Maker page, July 1st 2014.\\" On July 12 he posted the Game-Maker 3.0 source to GitHub, under the MIT license, suggesting that although people were free to use the code how they liked, \\"if there is interest in preserving the old games you guys made then porting Game-Maker to modern OSes is the first step.\\"  Release history  Game-Maker 3.0, CD-ROM edition * Game-Maker 1.0: Includes one 1.44 MB microfloppy disk containing the full set of RSD tools plus the games Sample, Terrain, Houses, Animation, Pipemare, Nebula, and Penguin Pete. Also included, beginning in version 1.04, is a separate diskette containing the GameLynk game Barracuda: Secret Mission 1. All 1.X iterations of Game-Maker include a square-bound 75-page user manual and several leaflets about the use of the software. Later versions (1.04, 1.05) also include leaflets explaining recent changes and updating the user manual. * Game-Maker 2.0: Includes both 1.2 MB floppy and 1.44 MB microfloppy disks containing the full set of RSD tools plus the games Tutor (a replacement for Animation), Sample, Terrain, Houses, Pipemare, Nebula, and Penguin Pete. Both versions 2.0 and 2.02 include a square-bound 94-page user manual and several leaflets about the use of the software. The latter version also includes a leaflet explaining recent changes and updating the user manual. * Game-Maker 3.0, floppy: A three-microfloppy (1.44 MB) package contains the full set of RSD tools, the in-house developed games Tutor, Sample, and Nebula, and three licensed games developed by the independent designer A-J Games: Zark, The Patchwork Heart, and Peach the Lobster. Both packages of version 3.0 include a square-bound 104-page user manual and several leaflets about the use of the software. * Game-Maker 3.0, CD-ROM: this package includes the contents of the floppy package, plus first- party games Pipemare, Penguin Pete, Houses, and Terrain; A-J Games productions Glubada Pond, Crullo: Adventures of a Donut, Cireneg's Rings, and Linear Volume; two games by Sheldon Chase of KD Software, Woman Warrior and the Outer Limits and Woman Warrior and the Attack from Below; and the GameLynk game Barracuda: Secret Mission 1. In addition, the CD-ROM includes a large collection of images, sounds, music, animations, and gameware elements, and a Shareware directory holding demo versions of fourteen games by various independent designers. * Create Your Own Games With GameMaker!: In 1995, the Canadian company Microforum rebranded and repackaged the CD-ROM version of Game-Maker 3.0 for release to a worldwide market. This version includes a spiral-bound user manual. The disc contents are the same as the original RSD release.  Game distribution  During Game-Maker's lifetime, users could distribute their games through the Gamelynk (aka Night Owl, later Frontline) BBS in Kennebunkport, Maine or through the Game-Maker Exchange program — an infrequent mailing to registered users, compiling submitted games to a floppy disc with occasional commentary from RSD president G. Oliver Stone. DIYGamer, \\"The Game-Maker Archive – Part 11: Mark A. Janelle\\" Many user-generated games also wound up on public bulletin boards, and thereby found wide distribution and eventual salvation on shovelware CD-ROMS.DIYGamer, \\"The Game-Maker Archive — Part 13: The World Wide Haystack\\" RSD's initial terms of use were rather restrictive. To quote from a pamphlet titled \\"Distributing Your GAME-MAKER Games\\" and dated May 9, 1993: The pamphlet goes on to detail standalone games, promotional games, and shareware and BBS distribution. For standalone games (which is to say, games that are meant as an end unto themselves), RSD asks a royalty of $500 for the first 200 games sold or distributed, then a small fee for each subsequent copy. The higher the number, the smaller the fee. For promotional software (distributed as part of a promotional kit), RSD asks $1000 for the first 1000 copies and then smaller fees for every copy up to 25,000. Beyond that, RSD asks no additional charge. Shareware and BBS distribution is a curious case. Although RSD prohibits free distribution, the license does allow a loophole for shareware so long as the author requests the user to pay a minimum registration or license fee of $5.00, then makes a quarterly payment of 10% of all collected fees. These restrictions were rarely enforced; as a June 15, 1993 pamphlet titled \\"Distributing Games\\" suggests, freeware games were common and tolerated despite the license agreement:  Open format  Despite the limitations on distribution, Game-Maker's design format is notoriously open. From its outset Game-Maker was designed as a collaborative tool, with the intent that users not only trade design tips but pick apart and freely sample from each other's work. A series of full-page magazine ads, run in the early 1990s, spends nearly as many words selling Game-Maker as a modification tool, along the lines of Galoob's Game Genie accessory, as it does describing the software's design features, promising that users can \\"modify and enhance Game-Maker games\\". \\"Is a game too easy? Increase the speed. Too boring? Add danger, sounds and monsters. Too plain? Dress up the graphics, add animation. Too short? Add new levels.\\" This \\"remix\\" philosophy stems partly from the Stones' own collaborative family dynamic, and — as with the insistence on an entirely visual, code-free interface — partly from concern about overwhelming the end user. \\"[W]e realized that it would be pretty hard for a ten to twelve-year-old to do it all himself so there were practical considerations.\\" To that end Game-Maker games are distributed as an unprotected bundle of resource files, both specialized (i.e., Game-Maker's unique graphic and animation formats) and common (including CompuServe .GIF, Creative .VOC, Autodesk .FLI, and ASCII text files), making it a simple task to identify and edit most Game-Maker games. The decision was a defiant one on the part of programmer G. Andrew Stone, who argued that any user concerned about protecting, rather than sharing, his work should take on that burden himself. As it happens, one of the earliest games distributed with Game-Maker was GameLynk's Barracuda: Secret Mission 1, a user-derived project that is most distinguished by its presentation whereby its file structure is hidden by LHarc compression and the portable Deluxe Paint Animation player is tacked onto the Game-Maker executable to provide intro and exit animations.  Limitations  Through its history several aspects of Game-Maker's engine, design interface, and feature set have experienced scrutiny from its user base. One of Game-Maker's more notorious qualities is its exclusive use of Creative's proprietary .VOC and .CMF sound and music formats, and its absence of integrated design tools for those formats (or recommendations as to external tools), leaving users to work out their own solutions — or often not.Sylvain Martin, \\"My RSD Game-Maker years\\" The use of .CMF was a last- minute decision; Andy had been working on a .MOD-style tracker format, but development was indefinitely delayed. As a temporary measure his brother Ollie plugged in code provided by Creative Labs. Other common frustrations include a lack of multi-key mapping for character behaviors, such as pressing Z + a directional arrow to jump in the direction pressed (a problem stemming from a lack of standardized keyboard electrical layouts at that time); the extreme simplicity of monster behaviors (partially due to a desire to eliminate programming from the design tools); a lack of persistent flags for game events Gamasutra, \\"James W. Morris: Learning to Game, Gaming to Learn\\" (partially due to memory constraints); and the lack of on-screen displays for health, lives, and other counters (due to Andrew's emphasis on full-screen rendering). Oliver Stone's Monster Maker 3.00 Monsters are a particular point of contention. Compared to characters, monsters have only limited interaction with their environments. For instance, monsters are not affected by gravity or other physics—and have no contextual AI to speak of, aside from a limited awareness of the character. Monsters also lack variable counters, such as hit points. Instead each monster (including NPCs, character shots, and some kinds of power-up) has a fixed \\"power level\\" between 0 and 255, and a collision between unequal monsters is resolved by destroying the weaker monster. The engine therefore does not lend itself to graduated damage (i.e., sword 1 does twice the damage as sword 2). Rather, collisions are all binary; either a weapon works, or it doesn't.  Workarounds  For advanced users, many of the engine's limitations have workarounds. One can approximate gravity's effect on a monster by defining a heavy diagonal path; the monster will move horizontally until it reaches a ledge, at which point it will fall until it hits the ground again. Similarly, although monsters lack hit counters, the user can create chains of identical (or successively injured-looking) monsters to approximate the same effect.DIYGamer, \\"The Game-Maker Archive: Mike Perrucci\\" In later years users have found ways to subvert or play along with the system's properties to achieve effects, mechanisms, and even genres unaccounted for in the engine's basic features—including extensive in-engine cutscenes, boss sequences, AM2-style sprite scalers,Mike Perrucci, \\"Invasion of the Blobs II.\\"Alan Caudel, \\"New Dummy 7 Game!\\" RPG style battles,Gamasutra, \\"The Game-Maker Story: Infoboxes\\" parallax scrolling, shooting galleries, and destructible terrain.A-J Games, \\"Builder: Build footholds. Destroy obstacles. Be observant.\\"  Influence  As one of the first complete game design suites for IBM-based PCs, and the only one devoted to action games during the early '90s Shareware boom, Game-Maker \\"anticipated the thriving indie game community we have today with countless game engines, web sites and indie game companies.\\" Several of its users went on to later note in indie or commercial game development, such as renowned Seiklus author cly5m,autofish.net, \\"RSD Game-Maker\\"insert credit, \\"From Shooter to Shooter: The Rise of cly5m\\" Slender: The Eight Pages designer Mark Hadley, Liight programmer Roland Ludlam,Gamasutra, \\"Roland Ludlam on Liight and the Hurdles of Game-Making\\" Warhammer Online background artist Justin Meisse,MobyGames, \\"Justin Meisse\\" and Bionic Commando associate producer James W.

He was elected Mayor of Zugló in 2014. His research areas are electoral systems and electoral behaviors. Career Karácsony worked for the Medián market and public opinion research company as a research manager. He became Director of Research in 2007. In addition he has been a lecturer at the Corvinus University of Budapest since 2004. He became a member of the newly formed Politics Can Be Different (LMP) party in 2009. During the 2010 parliamentary election he served as campaign manager of the party. He became a Member of Parliament from the Budapest regional list (3rd place). In May 2010 he was elected deputy leader of the LMP parliamentary fraction. As a result he left the Medián firm. He was the party's candidate at the Budapest District II by-election in November 2011. He came third with 6.45 percent after Zsolt Láng (Fidesz) and Katalin Lévai (MSZP). Both MSZP and LMP agreed that the candidate who received fewer votes would withdraw in favour of the stronger one, however Karácsony also participated in the run-off. In January 2013, the LMP's congress rejected electoral cooperation with other opposition forces, including Together 2014. As a result members of LMP's \\"Dialogue for Hungary\\" platform, including Karácsony, announced their decision to leave the opposition party and form a new organisation. Benedek Jávor, leader of the \\"Dialogue for Hungary\\" platform, said the eight MPs leaving LMP would keep their parliamentary mandates. The leaving MPs established Dialogue for Hungary as a full-fledged party. In June 2014, Karácsony was elected co- chair of Dialogue for Hungary alongside Tímea Szabó, when his predecessor Jávor became a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) in the 2014 European Parliament election. Karácsony won the mayoral election in Zugló during the 2014 local elections as a joint candidate of the Hungarian Socialist Party, Democratic Coalition, and the Together 2014–Dialogue for Hungary alliance. According to the new rules, he also became a member of the General Assembly of Budapest. In April 2017, Karácsony was re-elected co-leader of the Dialogue for Hungary and was also appointed as his party's candidate for the position of prime minister in the 2018 parliamentary election. The Hungarian Socialist Party also elected Karácsony as their candidate for the position of prime minister in December 2017. The two parties also decided to jointly contest the 2018 national election. Consequently, the Together has terminated their cooperation agreement with the Dialogue for Hungary. Under the leadership of Karácsony, the MSZP–PM joint list received 11.91% and came only third after Fidesz and Jobbik. In June 2019, in the opposition's first primary election, he was elected as the opposition's (MSZP-P-DK-Momentum-LMP-MLP While Jobbik did not endorse Karácsony outright, the party opted not to run a candidate against him. This left Karácsony as the sole opposition candidate for the position of Lord Mayor of Budapest in the 2019 local elections, against incumbent Lord Mayor István Tarlós, who was supported by the ruling coalition, Fidesz–KDNP. He then went on to win the election on 13 October 2019 with 50.86% of the votes being cast in his favor with Tarlós receiving 44.10%.

A Pearl vortex is similar to Abrikosov vortex except for its magnetic field profile which, due to the dominant air-metal interface, diverges sharply as 1/r at short distances from the center, and decays slowly, like 1/r^2 at long distances. Abrikosov's vortices, in comparison, have very short range interaction and diverge as \\\\log(1/r) near the center. A transport current flowing through a superconducting film may cause these vortices to move with a constant velocity v proportional to, and perpendicular to the transport current.

The characteristic length governing the distribution of the magnetic field around the vortex center is given by the ratio \\\\Lambda = 2 \\\\lambda^2/d, also known as \\"Pearl length,\\" where d is the film thickness and \\\\lambda is London penetration depth.

It was first described in 1888 by Léon Vaillant. The species lives in most tropical seas, but is more common in the eastern Atlantic, from western Ireland to Mauritania and from Sierra Leone to Angola, and also in the South China Sea. O. soleatus can grow to a standard length of and usually live from about deep. Description This species is a small fish, not exceeding in length. The body of Opisthoproctus soleatus is deep and laterally compressed. Scales are large, thin, and cycloid. The ventral side of the body was described by Vaillant as a “flattened, oval, elongate sole.” The sole extends forwards below the head. It is covered in large thin scales that increase in pigmentation in the distal parts. The back and sides of this fish are dark and the snout translucent, and there are a number of large melanophores behind and below the head. Opisthoprocus soleautus has a specialized modification of the intestine by the anus, termed the rectal bulb, that contains bioluminescent bacteria and produces light. A second specialized organ located in the sole of the body acts as a reflector for the rectal light-organ. Light generated by bioluminescent bacteria in the rectal bulb is transmitted into the tissue of the reflector organ, which has a reflective ventral wall that reflects the light downward. The reflector can be contracted or expanded, controlling the amount of light allowed to pass through the thin part of the scales and into the environment. The head is compressed. The snout is about ⅜ the length of the head. The mouth is small and extends to half the length of the snout. The upper part of the snout and the area of the head above the brain are semi transparent. Small teeth are present in the mouth on the lower jaw and the head of the vomer. The eyes are particularly distinctive, being tubular in shape and directed dorsally (upwards); they have a sideways-oriented diverticulum in the front wall of the eye, though it is unclear what the precise function of this pouch-like pocket is. The eye is large, equal in length to the snout, with the suborbital space covering the entire cheek and an extremely large lens. The suborbital bone is extended and covers the eye laterally. The caudal fin is large and forked, with 33 rays total. The dorsal fin is small and begins behind the middle of the body, and has 11 soft rays. The anal fin is inserted on the posterior of the body and has 6 rays. The pectoral fin has 13-15 rays, some of which are elongated and extend beyond the point of origin of the dorsal fin. The pelvic fin has 9-10 rays, and the adipose fin is present. Distribution and habitat O. soleatus is found in all the world's tropical and temperate oceans. It has been recorded in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. In the eastern Atlantic, it is most frequently encountered between western Ireland and Mauritania, and between Sierra Leone and Angola. Its range in the Atlantic Ocean extends from 20° N to 10-12° S, . Its depth range is but it commonly frequents the range, often limited by the isotherm which often occurs at about . This range falls within the mesopelagic region, which receives dim light from above. This region contains resident fauna, as well as transitional fauna that migrate vertically in response to changes in light.  Diet  Opisthoproctus soleatus has been found to primarily prey on bioluminescent siphonophores. The bioluminescence of these organisms makes them more difficult to detect against the dim incoming light; however, the structure of the lens and retina of O. soleatus increases the optics and resolution of the eye, allowing them to detect these cases of camouflage.  Predation  Opisthoproctus soleatus have been found in the stomachs of beached Soweby’s beaked whales (Mesoplodon bidens). Other species of Opisthoproctidae have also been found in the stomachs of Pygmy Sperm Whales and some seabirds. It has been proposed that the direction of emitted light from the rectal bulb and reflecting organ in the downwards direction decreases the chances of that light being detected by predators with forward facing eyes. Behaviour Like other deepwater fish, Opisthoproctus soleatus needs to find its prey in a very poorly-lit environment, and avoid being detected itself by a larger predatory species. Fishes with large upward- facing eyes likely hunt by detecting the silhouettes of prey above them in contrast to the low amounts of light coming in. At the depths at which this fish lives, light is still directional, and many fish species have photophores (luminous organs) on their underside which provide them with camouflage by replicating the scintillations on the surface of the water above. O. soleatus does not have photophores, but instead has a luminous organ inside its anus. The light produced is shone on a reflector which reflects it downward between the ventral scales to create an effect similar to that of the photophores of other species. While the exact purpose of this is unknown, it has been proposed that O. soleatus uses this apparatus as a method of camouflage or to communicate with members of their species.Poulsen, J.Y., Sado, T., Hahn, C., Byrkjedal, I., Moku, M. & Miya, M. (2016): Preservation Obscures Pelagic Deep- Sea Fish Diversity: Doubling the Number of Sole-Bearing Opisthoproctids and Resurrection of the Genus Monacoa (Opisthoproctidae, Argentiniformes). PLoS ONE, 11 (8): e0159762. Opisthoproctus soleatus is likely solitary, similar to Macropinna microstoma, another member of Opisthoproctidae.  Development & Reproduction  The larvae of Opisthoproctus soleatus appear similar to adults, and have similar body proportions. In contrast to the adults, the larvae are pigmented, particularly at the base of the caudal fin and in between the pelvic fin and the anus. In larvae, the sole is silver, with two lines of black pigment increasing in size laterally towards anus. Opisthoproctus soleatus is oviparous, as are all members of Argentinidae. Status This species lives in the deep ocean and is seldom encountered by man. This makes it difficult to tell whether the population trend is upwards or downwards, or whether the species is facing any particular threats. However, it is regularly encountered over a large part of the ocean system, and in 2012 there were said to be \\"223 occurrence records and 143 museum records\\". O. soleatus is not of interest to fisheries and appears rarely in bycatch. For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of least concern.

Wurtzel, directed by Herbert I. Leeds, that stars Lloyd Nolan, Carole Landis, Cornel Wilde, James Gleason, Lester Matthews, Louis Jean Heydt, and Ted North. The film's storyline concerns American civil engineering forces struggling to establish an operational radio base following the invasion of the Philippines, with Japanese army forces resisting, and with the complication of the arrival in their midst of a beautiful nightclub singer fleeing the Japanese. Plot After the Japanese army invades the Philippines, they capture the radio station owned by the American Radio Communications Company. The staff is forced to escape. and they head into the jungle, where they eventually meet up with a band of determined Filipino Scouts, known as Moros. Together, they cut their way through the dense jungle, finally making their way to the coast. The ARCC staff, made up of radio technician Jeff Bailey (Cornel Wilde) and communications men Lucky Matthews (Lloyd Nolan) and Tom O'Rourke (James Gleason), find an advance Japanese force occupying the plantation of an old friend. Working with the Moros as a guerrilla unit, they attack and kill the Japanese, seizing the plantation for its available radio transmitter. Solidifying their defense positions, the group quickly discovers there is no food or water and that the plantation is now largely surrounded by elements the Japanese army. A night club singer, Edna Fraser (Carole Landis), also escaping from the Japanese, has made it safely to the plantation as well. Jeff is working to repair the damaged radio set in order to send messages of hope and courage to the conquered Filipinos. His hope is to rally the populace against Japanese enslavement and exploitation by joining the Philippine resistance. The Japanese quickly become aware of this possibility, and using all means at their disposal, they launch a determined land and air campaign to find and destroy the radio transmitter. Jeff is killed, and the plantation comes under heavy bombardment from the air. As the bombs fall, Lucky is able to transmit a series of patriotic messages to the Filipino people, under the repeated call sign \\"Manila Calling, Manila Calling\\". He demands continued resistance, at all costs, to the Japanese invaders from everyone hearing the broadcast. He encourages unwavering belief that all 130 million Americans are behind them and that they have not abandoned the islands and its people but are working even now toward their liberation. As the bombs continue to fall, destroying the plantation buildings one by one, Lucky states in no uncertain terms that General MacArthur will make good on his pledge to return and free the Philippines and its people. He then pleads, \\"America, send us the tanks and the guns, and we'll finish the job. Manila calling, Manila calling, Manila calling\\"...

Assuredly, war is accompanied by a great deal of noise, and in that respect the producer, Sol Wurtzel, has gone all-out for realism. With all the enthusiasm of a youngster on the Fourth of July, he has filled his film with loud reports, concussions, flame and explosion. Machine guns chatter violently and at length. Actors grow hoarse shouting at each other above the uproar. If Mr. Wurtzel's tribute to the guerrillas of the Philippines could be measured by decibels alone, he would have a triumph. But drama, even in a disastrous inferno, sometimes has a still, small voice. In 'Manila Calling' it would been a hard time making itself heard\\". \\"As a man who keeps up with the headlines, Mr. Wurtzel has seized upon the idea of using the Japanese invasion of the Philippines as the background for a story similar to that of 'Lost Patrol.' A small band of fighting men seize a commanding height and after being augmented by several assorted civilians hold the position until their ranks are thinned out, one by one, and the last survivors blasted from the rock by bombers—the last two being Mr. Lloyd Nolan, a hard-bitten fellow, and Miss Carole Landis, erstwhile Ping Girl, who pops into the story without reasonable cause. Together they broadcast a brave message to the world before they are wiped out\\". \\"But neither the authors nor the director have capitalized on a sound dramatic device. They have simply made use of the clichés which require (a) that one man go berserk from the strain, (b) that one man try to escape at the expense of the others, and (c) that the tight- lipped hero has a heartbreaking story locked in his memory somewhere. From time to time Mr. Nolan dose succeed in creating a credible hero, but for the most part the characters are hackneyed in writing and performance. As an action film of the more rudimentary kind, 'Manila Calling' is continuously noisy. But considering\\" the subject and the times, that hardly seems enough\\".

He was born the eldest child of William Vaux, 3rd Baron Vaux of Harrowden, and his first wife, Elizabeth Beaumont, daughter of John Beaumont of Grace Dieu, Leicester. Both Henry Vaux's parents came from traditionally Catholic families. Family life After Henry's birth, William Vaux had three more children by his first wife: Eleanore (later to become the well-known priest-smuggler and recusant, Mrs Brooksby), Elizabeth (who became a Franciscan nun in Rouen) and Anne (who assisted Eleanore's recusant work under the pseudonym of ‘Mrs Perkins’). After his first wife's death, Lord Vaux married Mary Tresham in 1563. The new Lady Vaux was the sister of Sir Thomas Tresham who was to become a leading recusant spokesman in the Elizabethan age. The Tresham and Vaux families had been cordial neighbours for generations and had often intermarried. William Vaux had five more children by this second marriage: George, Edward, Ambrose, Muriel, and Catherine. Edmund Campion Lord Vaux's eldest two children, Henry and Eleanore, proved to be prodigious learners and in 1568 their father hired Edmund Campion of Oxford University (a future Jesuit martyr), to tutor them for several months. Later, on the eve of his departure to the Continent to study for Catholic orders, Campion wrote a letter of encouragement to Henry Vaux, his young former pupil, in Latin. Here is a brief (translated) extract: ::From the day your Father first asked me to see you and to superintend your education I have become amazingly attached to you. For I marvelled and was almost perplexed when I saw a boy who had not yet completed his ninth year, scion of a notable family, of such pleasant demeanour and refinement; who wrote and spoke Latin so well; who was equally good at prose and verse, accurate and quick at figures, devoted to the study of letters, diligent in application, able to sketch out and arrange his whole course of study. If circumstances had permitted it I should have desired nothing better than to give my enthusiastic help to that celebrated man, your Father, and to you, a boy of such great promise. But since some unknown fate, yours and mine, has deprived you of me and me of you, your Father (by whom I am dearly loved, and whom I particularly revere) has easily persuaded me that my voice and advice should come to you. ... ::::Oxford, 28 July 1570.'' Changing circumstances In 1571, William Vaux moved with his family to the grander family seat at Harrowden with the second Lady Vaux. The children of his first marriage were entrusted to the care of their maternal grandmother for the next ten years. She was provided with £20 annually for Henry and £10 for each of his three sisters. Lord Vaux formed an agreement with Sir Thomas Tresham whereby the knight would receive £100 per annum for a period of fifteen years and provide a dowry of £500 each for Eleanore, Elizabeth, and Anne. It was probably at his grandmother's residence that Henry Vaux wrote those poems of his which have survived. Some (\\"No trust in Fortune\\", \\"Beautie is brittle\\", and \\"Meditatio de Passione Christi\\") are dated as having been written when he was thirteen (c. 1572) and others (the Agamemnon poems) when he was seventeen (c.1576), but the similarity in style and subject in the remaining undated poems suggests that they were also written during his teenage years. Incidentally, Henry Vaux's cousins, Francis and John Beaumont, the playwright and the poet, came from the same home. Priest smuggling In 1580, Edmund Campion and Robert Persons, another leading Jesuit, were sent to England by Cardinal Allen and the Jesuit Father General. The pair reached England in June 1580, and on their arrival in London were met by George Gilbert, the organiser of an association of young Catholic gentlemen whose task it was to assist and provide for the missionary priests. Henry Vaux was one of the chief members of this group, as was his brother-in-law Edward Brooksby. From 1580 until his arrest in 1586, Henry Vaux was continually involved in sheltering priests. Refusal to marry In an attempt to secure the family's financial situation, Lord Vaux decided to arrange a profitable marriage for Henry. Henry refused, however, as he had decided to lead a contemplative life. In 1585 Henry Vaux reluctantly signed an agreement whereby his half-brother George would inherit the interests of the barony while he would receive a modest annuity for himself. After Henry Vaux's death the title would pass to George or his heir, thus reuniting the barony with the family fortune. Unwanted attention In August 1584 Henry Vaux was mentioned in a report to Sir Francis Walsingham, the Queen's spymaster, and from this time onwards his name appeared regularly in confessions and the reports of spies. (Henry Vaux unwittingly had two apostate priests in his employ). By May 1585, the government knew that Henry Vaux was serving as treasurer for the priest-smuggling network. At around that time he attended a large meeting of Jesuits, recusants, and secular clergy in Hoxton which established a fund for the support of the Catholic clergy and to which he promised one hundred marks. In May 1585 Anthony Babington visited Lord Vaux in Hackney about purchasing land from him in Nottinghamshire. While seemingly innocent enough, the Vaux family's subsequent association with Babington aroused the suspicions of Walsingham's spy network. Henry Vaux's house was closely watched once Walsingham became aware of the plot and in August 1586 Henry Vaux was named in a list of Babington's regular associates. Not only was he by now the de facto leader of the priest smuggling network, but he had been associated in the past with other conspirators such as Francis Throckmorton, a distant cousin, who had been executed in 1584 for conspiring to assassinate the Queen in 1583. Lord Vaux and Sir Thomas Tresham were suspected of being willing to aid the Babington Plot but were both in prison at the time. Southwell, Garnett and Arrest Robert Southwell and Henry Garnett (two future martyrs) arrived in England on 23 July 1586. Garnett was housed by Eleanore Brooksby and her sister Anne at Shoby while Robert Southwell took up residence at Henry Vaux's home in Hackney. From 1586-1587 Robert Southwell had the use of the Vaux house in Hackney. On 4 November 1586, the chief magistrate of London, Richard Young, led a search of the Vaux house but could not find Southwell. They did, however, arrest Henry Vaux, who was brought before the Privy Council and committed to the Marshalsea Prison. Leave and death On 22 May 1587 Henry Vaux was granted three months’ sick-leave from the Marshalsea. He had contracted consumption (modern-day pulmonary tuberculosis) and went to recuperate in Leicestershire where he was cared for by his sisters, Anne and Eleanore. He died unexpectedly on 19 November 1587. and was buried in the local parish. Father Henry Garnett later claimed that Henry Vaux uttered the simple vows of a Jesuit priest on his deathbed. However, Robert Persons makes no mention of Henry Vaux desiring to become a Jesuit, but rather indicates that he desired to lead a contemplative and celibate life. Persons makes the following tribute to Henry Vaux: ::That blessed gentleman and saint, Mr. Henry Vaux, whose life was a rare mirror of religion and holiness unto all that knew him and conversed with him. He died most sweetly and comfortably in England, having resigned long before his death, and in his perfect health, his inheritance to the barony to his younger brother, reserving only a small annuity to himself whereby to live in study and prayer all the days of his life, without marrying, as he fully resolved to do. ::::(Persons: 1878, pp.29-30)'' See also * William Vaux, 3rd Baron Vaux of Harrowden * Eleanor Brooksby * Anne Vaux References *Anstruther, Godfrey.

Subdivision Traditionally the plateau is divided into the Upper and Lower Barnim, separated by a line running between Strausberg and Eberswalde. Typically, Lower Barnim does not reach higher than 80 metres above mean sea level (AMSL) whereas Upper Barnim is generally more than 100 metres AMSL. The highest point of the plateau is Semmelberg which stands at 157 metres AMSL. The extent of the Barnim Plateau. Settlements Until the growth of Berlin in the 19th century, Barnim was only sparsely populated; in the eastern portion this continues to be the case. Excluding Berlin, only Bernau and Strausberg are the only settlements with more than 10,000 inhabitants. Werneuchen, Altlandsberg and Biesenthal are among the smaller towns in the area. Several once- independent towns such as Oranienburg and Wriezen, which were once independent towns, were incorporated into Berlin as a result of urban sprawl in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Geological Structure, Landforms and Soils Bedrock Deposits The southern edge of Barnim in the vicinity of Rüdersdorf unusually contains widespread deposits of limestone, Buntsandstein and Muschelkalk. The relatively high position of the limestone in the bedrock is explained by the presence of a salt dome; the migrating salt pushed the overlying sedimentary rock closer to the surface. The limestone deposits gave birth to an expansive quarry which provided building materials for the expanding Berlin, an example of which being the tower of St. Mary's Church. Kansan Glacial Period The deposits of the first glacial motions during the Kansan glaciation were laid as deep as 100 metres below the surface. They are particularly prominent in tunnel valleys. Kansan sediment primarily consists of till and deposits in proglacial lakes. Thanks to superposition with Wolstonian Stage sediment, it is generally only found at the surface in isolation around the Oderbruchrand area. Generally, present-day Barnim there is very little surface evidence of the Kansan period remaining. A geological and geomorphological map of Barnim Wolstonian Stage Only the two primary glacial motions of the Wolstonian Stage allowed the plateau to clearly emerge. Geologically, Barnim is composed mostly of deposits from the more recent Warthe Motion which extends as far as Fläming Heath. The till associated with the Wolstonian stage can be found on the surface or within a few metres of it in many places. The deposits of the older Drenthe Motion are much thinner and covered by deposits from younger movements. The Wolstonian period also saw the formation of several terminal moraines; for this reason there are numerous places throughout the plateau where the soil consists of clay made of oligocene and miocene, which belong to the tertiary period which predates the Wolstonian Stage by several million years. Last Glacial Period In the last glacial period, more commonly known as the last time the Earth experienced an ice age, glaciers reached 60 kilometres south of Barnim. Hydrology and Climate  Hydrology  = Watershed = The principal drainage divide between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea runs across the Barnim plateau from Northeast to Southwest. It also runs between the drainage basins of the Elbe and Oder rivers. Its course roughly follows that of the Frankfurt push moraine. The main features along the divide include the Wandlitzer See and the Liepnitzsee. = Streams = The stream Finow and the lake Großer Samithsee near Finowfurt The following streams drain into the Havel and Spree drainage basins: * Briese, confluence at Hohen Neuendorf * Tegeler Fließ, which flows into Lake Tegel and onto the Havel * Panke, confluence with the Spree in central Berlin * Wuhle, confluence with the Spree near Köpenick * Neuenhagener Mühlenfließ * Fredersdorfer Mühlenfließ * Northern tributaries of the Löcknitz (river), for example the Lichtenower Mühlenfließ The following tributaries flow into the Oder: * Finow, into which flow the Schwärze and Nonnenfließ tributaries at Eberswalde * Batzlower Mühlenfließ * Sophienfließ, which supplies the Schermützelsee and Stobber = Lakes = Despite being an area of Young Drift, Barnim has relatively few lakes. At the outwash plain, the deposition of glacio-fluvial sediment has led to a higher number of lakes, the most well-known of which are Wandlitzer See, Gamensee and Straussee. Kienberg towards Hellersdorf and Kaulsdorf.  Climate  As in the rest of the region, Barnim is located in the transition zone between the oceanic climate of Western Europe and the continental climate of Eastern Europe. Due to the relatively small height differential between Upper and Lower Barnim there is little difference between the climates of the two areas. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of -1 °C and the warmest is July, with an average temperature of 18 °C. The averages for Upper Barnim are marginally lower. The average annual precipitation for Lower Barnim is 550mm whereas in Upper Barnim it is 600mm. Due to the height of Barnim, the Oderbruch, which lies to the east and is on average 100 metres lower than Barnim, is in a rain shadow. This is compounded by the height of other surrounding areas such as Lubusz Land and Chorin. Whereas Barnim receives relatively high amounts of precipitation, the Oderbruch receives less than 500mm annually and is one of the driest regions in Germany. Main settlements in Barnim in 1250. The dashed line indicates the extent of modern- day Berlin. Settlement History  Paleolithic Age  There is evidence of settlement in Barnim at the time of the Allerød oscillation. Hunter- gatherers mainly followed the courses of rivers, confirmed by archaeological discoveries north of Berlin. Around 6000 years ago the first permanent agricultural settlements were established. Discoveries of sickles and troughs from the Bronze Age have been discovered in the west of Barnim. The Germanic Semnones tribe settled in Barnim, and after their migration the Slavic stem of the Sprevane tribe followed in the 6th and 7th centuries and settled near Biesenthal and Wandlitz.  Settlement since 1230  While the Slavic peoples tended to settle in lowland parts of Barnim near the relatively few areas, subsequent settlement of the plateau began in the 1230s by the House of Ascania under the rules of John I, Margrave of Brandenburg and Otto III, Margrave of Brandenburg as part of the German eastward expansion. Further settlement was also carried out under the House of Wettin, part of the Margravate of Meissen. The Wettiners expanded from the south with castles in Mittenwalde and Köpenick in Lower Barnim, whereas the Ascaniers expanded over the northern parts of Upper Barnim from Oranienburg to Strausberg. Conflicts over the question of territorial sovereignty contributed to the Teltow and Magdeburg Wars between 1239 and 1245 which were won by the Ascaniers. In a measure intended to cement Ascanian rule, the House founded the Chorin monastery and the Friedland convent, which is now a ruin. They are amongst the most significant medieval buildings in the region.  Thirty Years' War  After the Thirty Years' War a migration wave, mainly of Dutch colonists, arrived on Barnim. As with medieval settlement this was mainly confined to the areas along the rivers of Barnim. At the end of the 19th century the industrial revolution in Germany resulted in strong population growth in Berlin, which expanded into the plateau.

The organization that would become the Second Missouri was largely composed of ethnic Germans, who were generally opposed to slavery and strongly supportive of the Unionist cause. Although initially without any official standing, beginning on April 22, 1861, four militia regiments Blair helped organize were sworn into Federal service at the St. Louis Arsenal by Captain John Schofield acting on the authority of President Lincoln.The official designation of the first four regiments organized at the St. Louis Arsenal were the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Missouri Volunteers (3 Months Service). The 2nd Missouri Infantry Regiment included a significant number of members with military experience from service in Europe. Many had also participated in drill and marksmanship competitions in St. Louis's many Turnverein societies. The Second Missouri was an unusually large regiment, having two dedicated \\"Rifle Companies\\" in addition to its ten companies of infantry. Upon entry into Federal service the members of the new Second Missouri elected Henry Boernstein colonel of the regiment.Rombaur, Robert Julius, The Union Cause in St. Louis in 1861, St. Louis, St. Louis Municipal Centennial Year, 1909, p367 The new Missouri Volunteer regiments, subsequently elected (then) Captain Nathaniel Lyon as the brigadier general of the new brigade of Missouri volunteers. President Lincoln would later confirm Lyon's promotion from Captain to Brigadier general.  Military Service  On May 10, 1861, the 2nd Missouri Infantry participated in the arrest of the Missouri Volunteer Militia drilling at Camp Jackson at Lindell Grove on the western border of St. Louis City. As the Missouri militiamen were being march under guard back to the Arsenal near the riverfront, angry crowds confronted the Federal forces and the confused situation soon devolved into rioting and gunfire. Over 27 people were killed and the Camp Jackson Affair helped to polarize the state and send Missouri down the road to its own internal civil war. On June 15, 1861, the 2nd Missouri Infantry participated in the unopposed occupation of the Missouri state capitol at Jefferson City, Missouri, by Federal troops. Nine companies of the Second Missouri remained as the garrison at Jefferson City, under Colonel Boerstein who acted as interim military commandant of the city. Company \\"B\\" and Rifle Companies \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" continued up river in pursuit of fugitive Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson and the Missouri State Guard. At Boonville the three company battalion of the Second Missouri, fighting under the command of Captain Peter J. Osterhaus helped defeat the newly organized Missouri State Guard on June 17 in the short, one-sided Battle of Boonville.Report of Battle of Boonville, BG Nathaniel Lyon, Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, Ser 1, Vol III, p13 While the Battle of Boonville was small by later war standards, it had major strategic consequences, driving the pro-secessionist forces into the southern part of the state and securing the Missouri River valley and communications across the state for the Federal government. The Second Missouri garrison at Jefferson City made a number of expeditions and \\"scouts\\" into the counties near the state capital and the central Missouri River valley. A Second Missouri detachment from Jefferson City fought a small engagement with guerrillas at Mexico Missouri, on July 15, 1861. Osterhaus' small battalion continued to campaign with Lyon, marching southwest to Springfield, eventually confronting a united Confederate and Missouri State Guard force near Springfield. The resulting Battle of Wilson's Creek fought ten miles south of the city on August 10, 1861, was a bloody affair, and the second costliest in American History up to that time. Osterhaus, by that time promoted to Major, led his men in the fighting as part of Lyon's detachment of the Federal force on Bloody Hill. Isolated and outnumbered after a second Federal element under Colonel Franz Sigel was routed, the Federals on Bloody hill fought the Confederate forces to a stalemate.Report of Battle of Wilson's Creek, Major S.D. Sturgis, Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, Ser 1, Vol III, p68 The battle ended only after General Lyon was killed leading the 1st Iowa Infantry against the Confederate right. As the senior U.S. Army regular officer present, command devolved to Major Samuel D. Sturgis. Concerned about his force's ammunition supply, Sturgis decided to withdraw towards Springfield. Osterhaus' men withdrew with the battered Federal force to Springfield, then to Rolla, continuing on to St. Louis. The regiment was mustered out of Federal service on August 31, and the members were reorganized as the Second Missouri Volunteers (3 Years Service) on September 10, 1861, under Colonel Friedrich Schaefer.

A second- generation cinematographer whose father had shot films for Alfred Hitchcock and Jean Renoir, Kurant began as a documentary cameramanKodak On Film: Willy Kurant, ASC, AFC. before establishing himself as a director of photography for such filmmakers as Agnès Varda, Jean-Luc Godard, Orson Welles, Alain Robbe- Grillet, Jerzy Skolimowski, Chris Marker and Maurice Pialat. Kurant also collaborated extensively with musician Serge Gainsbourg. Kurant is a member of the French Society of Cinematographers and the American Society of Cinematographers. Biography Kurant was born in 1934 in Liège, Belgium, the son of German cinematographer Curt Courant, who had begun his career in the silent era and gone on to shoot films for Fritz Lang, Alfred Hitchcock, and Jean Renoir. Kurant lived in Liège until the age of eight, when, due to World War II, he was forced to move to the Belgian countryside with his older sister and her husband. Kurant was later sent to an orphanage, where he lived until the age of 17. As a teen, Kurant read issues of American Cinematographer magazine at an American Cultural Center. Though his father was a well-known figure in the field, Kurant was initially reluctant to pursue a career as a cinematographer, instead studying still photography.Cinematographers: Willy Kurant While working at a job processing film at a research lab in France, Kurant took an evening class at a small film school; it was then that he decided to pursue cinematography as a career. Kurant began his career as a cameraman in 1954, when he spent six months in the Belgian Congo as part of a documentary film crew. There, he worked on ten short propaganda films produced for the Ministry of Overseas France and her Colonies, and upon returning to Belgium, Kurant worked as a news cameraman for a television station. In 1957, Kurant received a scholarship to study as a trainee cameraman at Pinewood Studios. There, he worked as first assistant cameraman to English cinematographers Geoffrey Unsworth (on A Night to Remember), Harry Waxman (on Innocent Sinners) and Jack Hildyard (on The Gypsy and the Gentleman). At the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels, Kurant saw a German film crew using an Arriflex camera. This inspired Kurant to buy a camera of his own, as well as a set of lenses and a sound recorder. He then worked extensively as a freelance cameraman, travelling to Vietnam and again to the Congo. In 1962, Kurant moved to France to formally study cinematography. Kurant then began to establish himself as a cinematographer, shooting shorts for filmmakers such as Jacques Rozier and Marin Karmitz. In 1966, Kurant shot his first two features: Agnès Varda's The Creatures and Jean-Luc Godard's Masculine Feminine. Both films were shot in high-contrast black-and-white on 4X, a then-new Kodak film stock; Kurant later referred to the films' distinctive look as his \\"signature.\\" The next year, Kurant shot the TV movie Anna, directed by Pierre Koralnik starring Godard's ex-wife, Anna Karina. The film was co-written and scored by musician Serge Gainsbourg; this marked the first of several film collaborations between Kurant and Gainsbourg. Around the same time, Kurant served as the cinematographer on Orson Welles' French production, The Immortal Story. Welles then hired Kurant as the cinematographer for his thriller The Deep, which spent three years in production but was never finished.Willy Kurant: Welles DP on Immortal, Deep, Heroine In 1968, Kurant shot his first American film, The Night of the Following Day. In the 1980s, he worked on two films with director Maurice Pialat: A Nos Amours, from which Kurant was fired after two weeks of shooting, and the Palme d'Or-winning Under the Sun of Satan. He also worked on Boris Szulzinger's Mama Dracula (1980). Later in his career, Kurant shot a handful of films in the United States, including The Baby-Sitters Club and Pootie Tang. His most recent feature is Un été brûlant (2011), directed by Philippe Garrel; it marked Kurant's first work in seven years.

It is also the city's center of government, culture, history and entertainment and one of the major business districts in Metro Manila. Poblacion belongs to the city's West District where it forms part of its Northwest Cluster or \\"Cluster 3\\". It is bounded on the west by Nicanor Garcia Street and barangay Valenzuela, on the south by Kalayaan Avenue and the Makati CBD (Bel-Air Village), on the east by Estrella Street and Guadalupe Viejo, and on the north by the Pasig River. It has a total land area of 1,034,200 sq.m., that is 3.80% of the total land area of Makati. 3.20% or 17,120 of Makati residents also live in this area, or 17 residents per 1,000 square meters. Poblacion houses the upscale Rockwell Center and Century City. History  Pre-War Period Barangay Poblacion is the first settlement of the City of Makati. In fact, when one would mention San Pedro Makati during the pre-war period, it indicated Barangay Poblacion. Since it was the original community of the town, it became the center of the local government and has remained as such today. In 1620 the San Pedro Church was built by the Jesuits as the center of the Catholic Faith of then San Pedro Macati. The residents corrupted this name to “Sampiro” and used this moniker to refer to both the church and the town. When the Jesuits were expelled from all Spanish territories in the 18th Century, the Spanish government confiscated all their properties which included San Pedro Macati. This began the turnover of the land from one owner to another until the Zobel de Ayala-Roxas family began its modern development during the latter part of the 19th Century. Official records show that the first Municipal President of Makati was its illustrious son who hails from Poblacion, Marcelino Magsaysay. Most of the succeeding Municipal Presidents or Mayors were likewise bona fide constituents of Poblacion namely: Eusebio Arpilleda, Hermogenes Santos, Urbano Navarro, Jose Magsaysay, Pedro Domingo, Ricardo Arpilleda, Nicanor Garcia, Jose Villena and Maximo Estrella. The first Municipal Building called the Presidencia was built in 1918 in the middle of Poblacion at Plaza Trece de Agosto, now J.P. Rizal Street. It is now occupied today by the Museo ng Makati. Museo ng Makati situated along J.P. Rizal Avenue. What is now today Kalayaan Avenue was built in the early 20th century as the Meralco streetcar line to Pasig (formerly the Manila Suburban Railway). The building of the line partly led to a residencial and commercial boom in the town proper.  Postwar Period  From 1954 up to the late 1980s, Poblacion was served by the James Rockwell Power Plant owned by Meralco, one of many to be built within the capital region to provide electricity to millions of its residents. In 1961, then Mayor Estrella ordered the construction of a new municipal building in its present site which was donated by the Ayala Land, Inc. In the early years of the 21st Century, Mayor Jejomar Binay instituted the high-rise 22-storey City Hall of Makati, making Poblacion as the center of Makati’s government then and now. In 2006 and 2007, local and foreign urban planning consultants and other public and private sector partners conducted a Cultural Mapping Report of the Heritage of Poblacion, through the grant of Instituto Cervantes Spanish Program for Cultural Cooperation. Although Poblacion has kept its old-world charm, it has also embraced modernity and economic development with the presence of a number of commercial establishments in the area, specifically along the main thoroughfares of J.P. Rizal, Makati Ave., P. Burgos and Kalayaan, the Rockwell Center, the A. Venue Mall and Suites and the upcoming development by Century Properties in the old site of the International School called the Century City. Divisions Poblacion Makati Skyline Gramercy Residences located along Kalayaan Avenue. Century City is a mixed-used development along Kalayaan Avenue. Century Properties bought and developed the lot formerly occupied by the International School Manila. The Gramercy Residences, the Philippines' tallest residential building, as well as the Knightsbridge Residences are situated in this area. Recently, Centuria Medical Makati also opened within the community. The recently opened Century City Mall serves as the area's prime lifestyle center. Makati City Hall Complex is located along the one-way J.P. Rizal Avenue within the poblacion. The complex houses the 22-storey Makati City Hall, the Old City Hall, the Makati Regional Trial Court, Pio del Pilar National High School, and the Makati City Pumping Station situated along Pasig River. Makati Heritage District is a heritage area bounded by the streets of J.P. Rizal, P. Burgos, R. Palma and Kalayaan Avenue. The Museo ng Makati, which was built in 1918 and has been used as Makati's town hall from 1918 to 1961, is situated in the poblacion along J.P. Rizal Avenue. The Makati Parish Church, Poblacion River Park, Makati Science High School, Makati City High School and Makati City Public Market are situated in this district. Makati Commercial District is a commercial area bounded by the streets of Polaris, P. Burgos and Makati Avenue. It is known as the entertainment district of Makati, which restaurants, night clubs and boutique hotels in the city are mostly located in this area. On the west portion of the area, the Antel Lifestyle City, which houses the A. Venue Event Mall, is located. Picar Place is an upcoming mixed-use development by Picar Development located west of Century City which will contain one of the city's tallest buildings at 312 meters, The Stratford Residences now under construction along Kalayaan Avenue. The area is currently the location of Buddha Bar Manila. Rockwell Center Rockwell Center was constructed on a 15.5-hectare lot previously occupied used as a thermal plant operated by the Lopez-owned Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company until its closure in 1994. The project was named after James Rockwell, the Meralco's first president. The lot is bounded by J.P. Rizal Avenue to the north, where it faces the Pasig River, Estrella Street to the east, Rockwell Drive and Amapola Street to the south, and R. Palma Street to the west. Rockwell Center began its construction in 1998. The architectural firm Skidmore, Owings, Merril (SOM) carried out the design under the direction of former Design Partner Larry Oltmanns. Its centerpiece, the Power Plant Mall, opened in December 2000. The Rockwell Center includes high-rise office buildings, condominium towers, a law and business school and a shopping mall. Among the plans for the area is the Lopez Centre, proposed to have a height of over 1000 feet, which would make it the country's tallest building. This design been abandoned in favor of a 19 storey building that will house the Lopez family holdings offices and museum.

Most members of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae), to which it belongs, are tropical, but R. schneideriana, like other species of Roscoea, grows in much colder mountainous regions. Description Roscoea schneideriana is a perennial herbaceous plant. Like all members of the genus Roscoea, it dies back each year to a short vertical rhizome, to which are attached the tuberous roots. When growth begins again, \\"pseudostems\\" are produced: structures which resemble stems but are actually formed from the tightly wrapped bases (sheaths) of its leaves. Plants are tall with usually four to six leaves, although there may be as few as two. The leaves form a rosette at the end of the pseudostem and have narrow blades usually long by wide, usually curved (falcate), hairless (glabrous), and with a pointed tip. Flowers appear in July to August in the wild. The stem (peduncle) of the flower spike (inflorescence) is either held within the leaf sheaths or sometimes slightly extended from them. The flowers usually open one at a time and are purple or white. The ellipse-shaped bracts which subtend the flowers are . Each flower has the typical structure for Roscoea (see the diagrams in that article). There is a tube-shaped outer calyx, long, with a two-toothed apex. Next the three petals (the corolla) form a tube long, terminating in three lobes, an elliptical upright central lobe, about long and two similarly sized but somewhat narrower side lobes. Inside the petals are structures formed from four sterile stamens (staminodes): two lateral staminodes form what appear to be small upright petals, which are about long; two central staminodes are fused to form a lip or labellum, long by about wide. The labellum does not bend downwards and is split into two lobes for about half its length. The single functional stamen has a yellow anther, about long, with long spurs formed from the connective tissue between the two capsules of the anther. The stigma is funnel-shaped. Taxonomy Roscoea schneideriana was first described by Ludwig Loesener in 1923 as R. yunnanensis var. schneideriana. (R. yunnanensis is now regarded as a synonym of R. cautleyoides.) Jill Cowley raised it to a full species in 1982. Evolution and phylogeny The family Zingiberaceae is mainly tropical in distribution. The unusual mountainous distribution of Roscoea may have evolved relatively recently and be a response to the uplift taking place in the region in the last 50 million years or so due to the collision of the Indian and Asian tectonic plates. Species of Roscoea divide into two clear groups, a Himalayan clade and a \\"Chinese\\" clade (which includes some species from outside China). The two clades correspond to a geographical separation, being divided by the Brahmaputra River as it flows south at the end of the Himalayan mountain chain. It has been suggested that the genus may have originated in this area and then spread westwards along the Himalayas and eastwards into the mountains of China and its southern neighbours. R. schneideriana is in the Chinese clade, as would be expected from its distribution. Distribution and habitat Roscoea schneideriana is found in Tibet, Sichuan and Yunnan, in China, growing at altitudes of in mixed forests, moist stony grassland and rocky mountain cliffs.

Produced by Laleh herself, the album was released on Warner Music Sweden and Lost Army. Sjung is her first long play for four years since the January 2009 album Me and Simon. The album is produced, written, recorded, engineered and performed by Laleh. The release follows her appearance on popular Swedish television show \\"Så mycket bättre\\" towards the end of 2011. The album's lyrical theme centres on new environments and being an outsider, with elements of African drums and synthpop being incorporated into Laleh's sound for the first time. The physical release of the album contains a second disc which features her interpretations from \\"Så mycket bättre\\". All of these interpretations were also released as a digital download only extended play preceding the album on 25 December 2011 called Tolkningarna (Interpretations). Critics' opinions of the album were generally favourable although some were divided on the slightly new direction taken and the unevenness of the record. In its first week of release, the album entered the Swedish Albums Chart at number one, becoming her second album to peak at the top, and her first to debut at number one. It was at the top of the charts for four non-consecutive weeks and was certified platinum in March 2012. It also became her first-charting album in Norway, where it debuted at number eight and peaked at number one. The first single from the album was \\"Some Die Young\\", which was released in Sweden on 22 January. The song was performed by Laleh for the first time at the \\"P3 Guld Awards\\" on 21 January in Gothenburg. She performed alongside other artists including Veronica Maggio, First Aid Kit and Fibes, Oh Fibes! at the Sveriges Radio P3 event. \\"Vårens Första Dag\\" was released as the album's second single on 30 April 2012. \\"What You Want\\" was originally due to be released as the album's third single, but was scrapped in favour of \\"Elephant\\", which was sent out to radio in early 2013. In July 2013 it was announced that Laleh would release her first international album in Germany during the autumn. The first single from this release will be \\"Some Die Young\\". Promotion It was announced on 14 May 2011, that Laleh would be participating in the second season of TV4's popular Swedish reality television show \\"Så mycket bättre\\" (So much better). The announcement by the channel also confirmed that fellow Swedish artists, Timbuktu, Eva Dahlgren, Lena Philipsson, E-Type, Tomas Ledin and Mikael Wiehe would be participating. The program involves established artists living together for eight days on the Swedish island of Gotland. Each artist has a day dedicated to them, with the other artists attempting to produce a new interpretation of one of the singer's songs. The show, which is based on a Dutch format, then sees the artists gather together at the end of the day around a dinner table to listen to what has been produced. You also get a glimpse of their time together. The show began filming on 11 June 2011. The show began broadcasting on TV4 across Sweden on 29 October 2011 and, for the first two episodes, worldwide on the channel's online catch-up service, TV4 Play. Her performances on the show were lauded by both critics and the public, with her first five performances topping the Swedish iTunes chart. Her rendition of Eva Dahlgren's \\"Ängeln i rummet\\" became the highest peaking song on the Swedish Singles Chart released from the show's second season and was also nominated for \\"Swedish Song of the Year\\" at the Gaygalan Awards. Following the show, it was commonly noted in the media that she had been given \\"a second breakthrough\\". It was originally proposed that her album would be released in the fourth quarter of 2011 to capitalise on her higher profile from the show, but this was later scrapped. In December 2011, details of the album and an accompanying \\"big band\\" stadium tour emerged, of which all of the major newspapers ran stories on their website about. The fifteen-date tour to promote the album began on 3 March 2012 in Uppsala and ended on 29 April 2012 in Norrköping, with all of the major cities included. The biggest date on the tour was in Laleh's home town Gothenburg where she performed in front of 6,370 people at the Scandinavium on 20 April. Promotion for the album started in earnest in January, when she performed lead single \\"Some Die Young\\" for the first time at the \\"P3 Guld Awards\\" organised by Swedish youth-orientated radio station SR P3 on 21 January. The event was broadcast the next day on SVT1. Laleh also performed the single and was interviewed by Fredrik Skavlan on the popular Norwegian- Swedish prime-time talk show \\"Skavlan\\". The programme, which is a co- production between NRK and SVT, was shown in both countries and is also shown on BBC Entertainment at a later date. Reception Critical response Sjung received mostly positive reviews from music critics. The Swedish website, Kritiker, which assigns a normalised rating out of 5.0 to reviews from mainstream critics across the country gave the album an average score of 3.5, based on 25 reviews, which indicates favourable reviews. This score was just below that given to her debut album, and improved upon her previous two albums. Markus Larsson of Aftonbladet compared Laleh to Canadian singer Feist, saying that \\"Feist's music sometimes feels like Laleh's big sister\\". He went on to say that the album is like a \\"Spotify-list of Laleh favourites\\" with \\"multiple influences that haunts today's most modern pop music\\". He ends by calling this Laleh's \\"second breakthrough\\". Anders Jaderup of Sydsvenskan praised the album for being less sprawling than her previous releases and stepping \\"towards conventional mainstreampop without losing either the personality or the mixture of seriousness and fun as always influenced her music\\". He picked out \\"Vårens första dag\\" (Spring's First Day) as showing \\"exuberant energy\\" and being a \\"great pop song\\". In a review for local newspaper Norran, Per Strömbro praised Laleh's producing and said that the record was \\"often quite grand, with big words and concepts\\". Nanushka Yeaman from Dagens Nyheter praised the personal feel to the album which is \\"nice and touching\\". They went on to say that \\"this is Laleh's strongest album to date and there is no doubt that she will take festival-Sweden this summer\\". Anders Nunstedt, music editor from the Swedish tabloid Expressen, said the album may well be the \\"year's big Swedish pop record\\". He noted that \\"the step from African rhythms [on \\"Elephant\\"] to the Abba-drama that bloom in the chorus of \\"Some Die Young\\" is great, and that the gentle soul which appears in \\"Who Started It\\" is at another musical discipline than the feverish indie pop that stains the \\"Vårens Första Dag\\", but Laleh's songs connect... in spite of all genres and language changes\\". Metro critic Peter Lindholm gave a mixed review of the album, saying that it \\"is full of impressions of other artists\\", but added that \\"Laleh absorbs influences from all possible directions and moves effortlessly between languages\\". Peter Carlsson in Nerikes Allehanda said that the album is \\"her best to date, although it feels somewhat disturbing that eight of the eleven songs are in English and three in Swedish\\". Linn Dupont in Helsingborgs Dagblad said that the album \\"is straight and direct. Laleh stays on the mat, but still flying among the clouds in her own charming way. \\"Vårens första dag\\" has already been praised. I understand why. Laleh is best in Swedish and so here too. But the bonus songs from \\"Så mycket bättre' does not make any difference. Her fourth album feels like \\"Easy with Laleh\\" – easy for those who did not have her music for themselves before\\". She ends by noting that \\"2005 [was] Laleh's year. Now it's time again, along with a new audience\\". The Uppsala Nya Tidning gave the album a mixed review, stating that \\"the main problem with Sing is that it is an uneven album. Sprawling in the wrong way. And there is something irritating in this by mixing English songs with some Swedish. I do not buy it... Laleh loses momentum and it pulls down the score\\". It finishes by saying that it is still \\"Laleh's best album to date\\" However, Svenska Dagbladet's Dan Backman took a dislike to the album, saying that she got \\"a second breakthrough by TV4 series Så mycket bättre... unfortunately, she follows up the success of cover songs from Så mycket bättre with a largely pretty weak album\\", believing that the record was produced for radio, ultimately reducing the quality of the music. He also commented on the bonus disc's recordings from the TV show by noting that \\"when decoupled from the ingratiating performer cosiness at the dinner table... are painfully flat\\". Commercial performance Upon its release, Sjung debuted at number one on the Swedish Album Chart for the week of 3 February 2012. This became Laleh's second number one album, following her self-titled debut's peak at the position 44 weeks after entering the list. The album continued its run at number one for two more weeks, before dropping to number two. It stayed within the top five until its tenth week on release where it placed sixth. In its twelfth week of release the album returned to the top of the charts. On 20 March 2012 the album was certified gold and platinum in Sweden, signalling shipping of over 40,000 units. In Norway, Sjung became Laleh's first charting album, entering the VG-lista at number eight. In its second week, the album stayed in the same position before falling out of the top ten in its third week. It returned the following week at number ten, before jumping to eight once again. The album recorded a new peak on 23 March of number seven and continued to rise in the following weeks 6–5–1. Singles \\"Some Die Young\\" was released as the album's lead single on 22 January 2012. It reached a peak of number nine on the Sverigetopplistan and number two on the DigiListan in Sweden. It also became a massive success in Norway, peaking at number one for seven consecutive weeks after being on the list for eight weeks. It peaked at number thirty-eight in Denmark. The song garnered positive response by music critics in Sweden. Expressen, described the song as \\"great\\", with its \\"Abba- drama that blooms in the chorus\\". Peter Carlsson in Nerikes Allehanda noted that the song was \\"[refrained] like \\"Elephant\\" and \\"What You Want\\", but it is perhaps, above all, the high-quality smoothness that will impress in the long run\\". The song's music video premiered on the Aftonbladet website and Lost Army's official YouTube page on 26 January 2012. Due to downloads from the album, \\"Vårens Första Dag\\" also managed to chart on the DigiListan at number fifty-six following the release of the album. It was the second single released from the album, sent out to radio in mid-March and released on 30 April 2012. The album's physical release contains a second disc which features six songs previously available on the digital only extended play, Tolkningarna, and the Så mycket bättre season two compilation albums. Of these, four songs charted on the Sverigetopplistan in 2011. The first of these was Laleh's cover of Tomas Ledin's \\"Just nu\\", which peaked at number twenty- five. The interpretation of Eva Dahlgren's \\"Ängeln i rummet\\" peaked at number six. The song became her highest selling and peaking record to date in Sweden and remained in the top 40 for thirteen weeks. It was nominated for \\"Swedish Song of the Year\\" at the Gaygalan Awards. The rendition of \\"Alla vill till himmelen men ingen vill dö\\" by Timbuktu peaked at number twenty-five. During the course of Bättre, Laleh's interpretation of the song was chosen as the best from that week. Scandipop said of the song \\"we're still unconvinced by that one\\", but admitted \\"we're seemingly behind the rest of Sweden – as it’s joined the former two songs in the heights of the Swedish iTunes chart, resulting in an all Laleh top\\". The sole English language cover, E-Type's \\"Here I Go Again\\", peaked at number forty-one in its first week on the chart, as well as entering at number one on the downloads chart. During the showings of \\"Så mycket bättre\\", Laleh broke a Swedish digital chart record by having ten songs on the top sixty list, including nine inside the top 40. Two interpretations of her songs from the show by other artists also appeared, to bring a total of twelve songs she had involvement with in the chart at once.

In 1913 he was the first to discover the ancient skeleton of a human in the Olduvai Gorge, in what is now Tanzania. He collaborated with Louis Leakey in a return expedition to the site in 1931. Birth and education Reck was born into a military family in Würzburg, Bavaria on 24 January 1886. He attended the universities of Wurzburg and Berlin, where he studied natural history and became deeply interested in volcanoes. Iceland Herðubreið volcano in Iceland In the summer of 1907 the geologist Walther von Knebel, a friend and fellow student of Reck's, disappeared during a field trip in Iceland. Hans Reck was charged with determining what had happened, and set out in June 1908 with two local guides and his fiance, Ina von Grumbkow. The party traveled on horseback in eleven weeks. Reck and the Icelander Sigurður Sumarliðason were the first people ever to reach the summit of the Herðubreið volcano, above the surrounding plain. Reck climbed down to the edge of what would later be called Lake Knebel (now Öskjuvatn), a boiling sulphurous lake where von Knebel's death had been reported, but found no remains. However, they concluded that von Knebel had died in an accidental drowning when his boat overturned. Reck used what he learned about volcanoes on this expedition in his doctoral dissertation. He graduated from the University of Munich in November 1910 and took up a post in the Berlin Museum of Natural History. First East African Expedition Skeleton of a Kentrosaurus, a member of the Stegosauria, found in the Tendaguru Formation (Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin) Hans Reck studied at University College London, then became a private lecturer at the Museum of Natural History. He married Ina von Grumbkow in February 1912. She was considerably older than him, having been born in September 1872, and was a strong and capable woman. The Recks were assigned to follow up the 1911 expedition that had made a large collection of fossils at Tendaguru in German East Africa (now Tanzania). They reached Tendaguru in June 1912, rebuilt the camp and quickly settled into a routine of quarrying to collect dinosaur bones, helped by a large workforce of local people. Great quantities of rubble were excavated to uncover the bones, which lay about below the surface. These included the well-preserved skeletons of two stegosaurs, an armor-plated dinosaur. Ol Doinyo Lengai, which Reck climbed in 1913 Reck found an early Iron Age site at Engaruka, where a stream from the Ngorongoro hills plunges down the western wall of the Gregory Rift at a point between Lake Natron and Lake Manyara, and published a description in 1913. Also in 1913, Reck made an ascent of the Ol Doinyo Lengai volcano in the Gregory Rift, about south of Lake Natron He was the third geologist to do so. Oldoinyo Lengai is the only active carbonatite volcano in the world. In 1914 Reck published a comprehensive report that summarized all that was known about this volcano so far, from his and earlier expeditions. It described the geographic position of the volcano, history of explorations, geomorphological studies and gave a detailed account of the crater region, accompanied by photographs. Olduvai Gorge 2011 In 1911 Wilhelm Kattwinkel, a German entomologist, had found interesting fossils in a ravine on the borders of the Serengeti Plains which turned out to contain the remains of a prehistoric three-toed horse. He gave the site the name \\"Oldoway\\", later to be changed by the British to Olduvai. In October 1913 Reck managed to find the site again, despite vague directions. He spent the next few months making a geological survey and collecting over 1,700 fossils. The site was unusual in being made of distinctive layers of different-colored lavas and ash. Although there was no way at that time of accurately dating the layers, they did indicate the relative age of the deposits. In December 1913 one of the workmen found a bone protruding from one of the oldest layers, Bed II, at a level where extinct animals from the Pleistocene had been found. He started to excavate, then told Reck of his find. Reck directed the excavation. The workers used hammers and chisels to excavate a human skeleton with modern anatomy that was embedded in a block of sedimentary rock. Reck examined the surrounding rocks carefully, but found no sign of disturbance that could indicate a burial at some later data. Reck took the skull back to Berlin in March 1914, and published an article in which he speculated that the skeleton was of a man from 150,000 years ago, far earlier than had been previously considered for the origin of man. The announcement caused a considerable stir, although many people dismissed Reck's claims, saying it must be a recent burial. World War I Reck returned to East Africa to work for the government as a geologist after the outbreak of World War I in July 1914. In June 1915 Reck discovered more Pleistocene fossils at a site close to Minjonjo, which he considered to have a similar age to those he had found at Olduvai. In September he returned to this site, and dispatched two loads of fossils to the Ufiome base. In 1915-1916 Reck excavated burial mounds in the Ngorongoro crater. The mounds held stone bowls and beads buried with the skeletons, but Reck did not identify any Stone Age tools. In April 1916 a force of British and Belgian troops advanced from the west. Ina escaped and Hans Reck volunteered and was appointed commander of a small squad of troops. In June 1916 Reck turned over his field notes, personal valuables and the collection of pterosaur bones from Tendaguru to a Swiss railway engineer, who promised to take them to Switzerland if possible. In late August 1916 Reck was ordered to move into the Uluguru Mountains. Inconclusive fighting continued for the rest of that year, with the allies handicapped by demolitions and suffering considerably from harsh conditions, disease and lack of supplies. Starting in 1917 the allies gradually began to gain the ascendancy, and by November 1917 the last Germans capable of leaving the country evacuated it for Portuguese East Africa. Reck was not with them, having been taken prisoner late in 1917. Later career Louis Leakey with skulls from Olduvai Gorge After the war, the British took over German East Africa, now named Tanganyika. Hans Reck was released from internment in Africa and returned to the Museum to resume his work as an assistant there. In 1927 the anthropologist Louis Leakey visited Munich to examine the Oldoway Man, and he returned in 1929 for a further study. In his opinion the skeleton was not nearly as old as Reck thought, but was probably about the same age as stone age skeletons from around 20,000 years ago that Leakey had found in Kenya. Leakey found the rock and fossil collection from Olduvai was also similar to his Kenya finds. He thought some could be tools, and suggested other tools might be found at Olduvai. Reck disagreed, saying he had searched for tools and found none in 1913. Leakey invited Reck to accompany him on a fresh expedition to Olduvai, which Reck gladly accepted. The expedition reached Olduvai in September 1931. Leakey soon found a hand-axe made from volcanic rock, not from the flint that Reck had been searching for, winning a large wager the two men had made. Within the next four days seventy seven hand axes were discovered. Leakey examined the location where Reck had found the skeleton, and quickly came to accept Reck's estimate of its age. Leakey, Reck and Arthur Hopwood, another paleontologist, drafted a letter to Nature that stated that the question of the age of Olduvai Man was settled, and was nearly half a million years, and Leakey made a quick return trip to Nairobi to dispatch this and other letters announcing the find. Volcanic craters at Santorini in the Aegean Reck had lost all his notes on Olduvai during World War I, but published a book of his first expedition in 1933 called The Ravine of Primeval Man. Hans Reck undertook a major study of the Santorini islands in the Aegean in 1936, working with Neuman van Padang and others. The islands form the rim of a caldera. The detailed 1936 work was a major contribution to understanding the evolution of the Santorini volcano and its relation to the geology of the region. Reck was planning to prepare a detailed report on the 1913 and 1931 Olduvai findings, but first left on an expedition to Portuguese East Africa. Reck had a congenital heart problem, although this had not stopped him in his many expeditions. He died of a heart attack in Lourenço Marques in August 1937. Hans Reck was not just a vulcanologist and paleontologist, but was an enthusiastic collector of Arab art and a skilled pianist. Apart from the skull, most of the skeleton found by Reck at Olduvai was destroyed by bombs during World War II (1939–1945). After the war ended his widow attempted unsuccessfully to locate his field notes, contained in many volumes, but they could not be found.

The amateur entomologist James John Joicey commissioned Barns to collect specimens of lepidoptera in Africa on his behalf. Early life and background The second son of the Rev. William Amos Barns, by his marriage to Eva Cecilia Buckworth, Barns was born at Bletchingley, Surrey, in 1881 and educated at Cranleigh School.'BARNS, Thomas Alexander', in Who Was Who 1929–1940 (London: A. & C. Black, 1967 reprint, ) His father was a Church of England clergyman and a graduate of St John's College, Oxford.The Ecclesiastical gazette, or, Monthly register of the affairs of the Church of England (1877), pp. 97–98 His mother, Eva Cecilia Buckworth, was the daughter of the Rev. Thomas Everard Buckworth (born 1822), Rector of Norbury, Staffordshire, whose mother Helena Hare Clarke was one of the sisters of General Sir John Clarke (1787–1854), a veteran of the Peninsular Wars.Sir John Clarke at thepeerage.com, accessed 4 January 2012Reverend Marshal Clarke at thepeerage.com, accessed 4 January 2012 In 1868, at the age of thirteen, Eva Cecilia had been awarded the Royal Humane Society's Silver Medal for saving her ten-year-old sister Blanche Rosa from drowning in a pool of the River Erme at Ivy Bridge, Devon. She then needed to be saved herself by her governess.DNW Lot 548, 13 Dec 07 at dnw.co.uk, accessed 4 January 2012Royal Humane Society Case No 18,108 Career In 1898, at the age of seventeen, Barns went to Africa as an assistant manager to the Nyasaland Coffee Company. From 1900 to 1903 he was agent for the Tanganyika Concessions in Northern Rhodesia, where he also worked in ranching and organised expeditions to German and Portuguese East Africa, shot elephants, traded ivory, and collected zoological specimens for museums, such as a large African elephant for the South Kensington Museum. Between 1919 and 1922 Barns led three Trans-African Research Expeditions through the Belgian Congo and the Tanganyika Territory. He became the first Englishman to describe the Ngorongoro Crater, a volcanic caldera in the Crater Highlands of what is now Tanzania, at that time the largest known crater in the world. In his The Wonderland of the Eastern Congo (1922), Barns was an early observer of mountain gorillas and reported that he had observed them living in large troops and that all such troops included at least two adult females with young of different ages.C. K. Ogden, Psyche: An Annual General and Linguistic Psychology 1920–1952 (1995), p. 51: \\"Mr. T. A. Barns has also found the gorillas in the Eastern Congo living in large troops consisting of 'quite a number of gorillas', each troop including at least two females with several young of varying ages (T. A. Barns, The Wonderland of the Eastern Congo)\\" Some of Barns's expeditions to Africa were sponsored by James John Joicey, an amateur entomologist. One of these trips lasted a year, when travelling with his wife Barns collected many specimens of Lepidoptera for Joicey's Hill Museum at Witley.Sir Norman Lockyer, ed., Nature, vol. 106 (Nature Publishing Group, 1921), p. 56: \\"The museum has lately also received large collections of Lepidoptera from Central Africa, obtained by Mr. and Mrs. T.

The film score was composed by George Bruns, with songs written by Terry Gilkyson and the Sherman Brothers. Composition The instrumental music was written by George Bruns and orchestrated by Walter Sheets. Two of the cues were reused from previous Disney films, with the scene where Mowgli wakes up after escaping King Louie using one of Bruns' themes for Sleeping Beauty, and Bagheera giving a eulogy to Baloo when he mistakenly thinks the bear was killed by Shere Khan being accompanied by Paul J. Smith's organ score from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. \\"Overture\\" and \\"Jungle Beat\\" are scores separated from one deleted score \\"The Sand of Time\\" from The Sword in the Stone. Longtime Disney collaborator Terry Gilkyson was brought in to write the songs for the film. Gilkyson delivered several complete songs which were faithful in tone to Rudyard Kipling's novel, but Walt Disney felt that his efforts were too dark. The Sherman Brothers were brought in to do a complete rewrite, on the condition that they not read Kipling's book. The only piece of Gilkyson's work which survived to the final film was his upbeat tune \\"The Bare Necessities\\", which was liked by the rest of the film crew. In one of his first union jobs, famed songwriter Van Dyke Parks arranged the version of \\"Necessities\\" heard in the film. Walt Disney asked the Shermans to \\"find scary places and write fun songs\\" for their compositions, and frequently brought them to storyline sessions. The duo decided to do songs that fit in the story and advanced the plot instead of being interruptive. The song \\"Trust in Me\\" is based upon a song entitled \\"Land of Sand\\" which had been written by the Sherman Brothers for, but not used in, Mary Poppins. \\"We're Your Friends\\" was originally conceived as a rock and roll song, sung by the quartet of vultures. The vultures were even designed based on The Beatles, with moptop haircuts and Liverpudlian accents, and would be voiced by the band, which did not come into fruition due to problems with their schedule. During production Disney decided the 60's style rock would cause the song to be considered dated later, leading \\"We're Your Friends\\" to be changed to the barbershop quartet that appears in the film. One of The Mellomen's members, Bill Lee, sang as Shere Khan during the final recording of the song because George Sanders was unavailable, and can be heard on the soundtrack. Versions Storyteller The first version was Walt Disney Presents the Story and Songs of The Jungle Book, also known as the \\"Storyteller\\" version, issued on the Disneyland Records label. It featured a retelling of the story with narration by voice actor Dal McKennon as Bagheera, and dialogue and sound effects from the film itself along with the songs. It was a commercial success, being certified Gold by the RIAA, and was later nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Album for Children. Another version, simply titled The Jungle Book, was issued on the Buena Vista Records label, featuring less narration and dialogue to be marketed for adults. It was first reissued on CD in 1990, as Disneyland Records was reworked into Walt Disney Records. ;Track listing Songs from The Jungle Book and Other Jungle Favorites Disneyland Records issued another soundtrack album in 1967, Songs from Walt Disney's The Jungle Book and other Jungle Favorites, which featured reworked jazz versions of the film's songs plus two covers, performed by Louis Prima and his band under the title \\"The Jungle V.I.P.s\\". ;Tracks 1997 reissue Disney Records reissued the soundtrack in 1997, coinciding with the reissue of the film on VHS to celebrate its 30th anniversary. The soundtrack marked the first time a majority of George Bruns' instrumental score was included. This version included an interview with the Sherman Brothers, and four bonus songs: two demos of the discarded Terry Gilkyson songs, and two songs taken from the 1968 Disneyland Records album More Jungle Book, an unofficial sequel to the film written by screenwriter Larry Simmons. ;Track listing References Bibliography * External links *The Jungle Book soundtrack at Disney.com Soundtrack Disney animation soundtracks 1967 soundtrack albums Walt Disney Records soundtracks ","title":"The Jungle Book (soundtrack)"},{"id":"34272853","text":"Jennifer Morilla Bejarano (born 23 January 1989) is a Spanish footballer who plays as a forward for Primera División club Sporting de Huelva.

He was a city Alderman and was Lord Mayor of London from 1709 to 1710.  Early life  Garrard was born in 1650, the second son of Sir John Garrard, 2nd baronet, and his wife Jane Lambard, daughter of Sir Moulton Lambard of Westcombe. He was a grandson of the first baronet Sir John Garrard, and maternal grandson of Dr. John Cosin, Bishop of Durham. His family were connected with the city of London for more than two centuries and intermarriages took place between the Garrards and the city families of Roe, Gresham, and Barkham. Two of his ancestors were Lord Mayors, Sir William Garrard in 1555, and Sir John Garrard in 1601. Garrard carried on business as a merchant first in Watling Street and afterwards in Warwick Court, Newgate Street. He married Elizabeth Poyner, daughter of George Poyner of Codicote Bury, Hertfordshire on 16 October 1675. After she died without issue, he married as his second wife Jane Bennett, daughter of Thomas Bennett of Salthrop, Wiltshire on 22 January 1689. By the death, on 13 January 1700, of his brother Sir John Garrard, the third baronet, he succeeded to the baronetcy and the family estate of Lamer in Wheathamstead, Hertfordshire. He continued to reside and carry on business in London.  Career  Garrard was elected alderman of the ward of Aldersgate on 3 March 1701. In 1701, after a contested election, he was appointed Sheriff of London and Middlesex. Garrard was returned as Tory Member of Parliament for Amersham on the Drake interest at a by-election on 10 March 1701. He was blacklisted for opposing preparations for war with France. He was not returned again for Amersham until a by-election on 14 November 1702. He voted for the Tack on 28 November 1704. He was returned in a contest at Amersham at the 1705 English general election and voted against the Court candidate for Speaker on 25 October 1705. At the 1708 British general election, he was returned unopposed as Tory MP for Amersham. He served the office of Lord Mayor in 1709–10. There was no pageant at his inauguration, the practice having been finally dropped after the mayoralty of his predecessor, Sir Charles Duncombe, for whom a pageant was prepared, but not exhibited on account of the death of Prince George of Denmark. At the beginning of his mayoralty, on 5 November 1709, Dr. Henry Sacheverell preached before him at St. Paul's his celebrated sermon advocating the doctrines of non-resistance and passive obedience, for which, and for an earlier sermon preached at Derby in August, he was impeached before the House of Lords. Garrard is said to have approved of the sermon and to have sanctioned its publication, but this he repudiated in the House of Commons when Sacheverell pleaded the encouragement of the Lord Mayor in mitigation of his offence. During the serious riots which followed this trial Garrard exerted himself with much energy to restore order, and issued a proclamation, dated 30 March, prohibiting assemblies in the streets, the lighting of bonfires, and the sale of seditious books and pamphlets. In October 1710 Garrard was chosen colonel of one of the regiments of the trained bands, and in the same year he became master of the Grocers' Company, of which he was a liveryman. However he did not stand for Parliament again at the 1710 British general election, probably as a result of his behavior during the Sacheverell affair. In October 1720, he was chosen as president of Bridewell and Bethlehem Hospitals, and his portrait in full length, by an unknown artist, is preserved in the hall of Bridewell. Garrard removed as Alderman to Bridge Ward Without in 1722, becoming senior alderman. He was also deputy-lieutenant of Hertfordshire. Death and legacy Garrard died on 10 March 1724, and was buried in Wheathamstead Church, where a monument remains to his memory. By his second wife, Jane, he had five daughters and three surviving sons, Samuel (died 1761), who succeeded to the baronetcy; Thomas (died 1758), who became Common Serjeant of London; and Bennet (died 1767), who was Member of Parliament for Amersham and sixth and last baronet. His will, dated 20 December 1723, was proved in the P. C. C. on 1 April 1725. His property included estates in Exhall and Bedworth, Warwickshire; in Wheathamstead, Hertfordshire; and in the city of London; besides stock and annuities in the South Sea Company.

Ukiyo-e print by Ogata Gekkō. was a general in the early Imperial Japanese Army, and the highest ranking casualty on the Japanese side in the First Sino-Japanese War. Life and career Ōdera was born in Satsuma Domain (present day Kagoshima Prefecture), as the second son of a samurai in the service of the Shimazu clan. He studied at the domain’s military academy, and fought in the Boshin War of the Meiji restoration. During the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he fought alongside fellow Satsuma clansmen Yamamoto Gonnohyōe and Shibayama Yahachi. In an anecdotal account of the battle, Ōdera was sleeping when Tokugawa forces opened fire. When awakened by his comrades, he complained that he could not see the enemy since it was too dark, and he would wait until daylight to fire back as he did not want to waste ammunition. In 1872, he entered the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army as a second lieutenant. He was soon promoted to lieutenant, and in February 1874, Ōdera participated in the suppression of the Saga Rebellion, followed by the Taiwan Expedition of 1874. He later served in the Hiroshima Military District, the IJA 12th Infantry Regiment, During the Satsuma Rebellion, he was a company commander. During the campaign, he lost his right ear to enemy gunfire, but was instrumental in taking Kumamoto Castle back from the rebels. Ōdera subsequently served with the IJA 11th Infantry Regiment, as a brigade commander in IJA 8th Infantry Regiment, and as a brigade commander in the Imperial Guards. He was promoted to captain in 1888, after which he served as chief of staff of the IJA 2nd Division, IJA 4th Division and IJA 1st Divisions. In February 1894 and he was sent to the United States and Europe as a military attaché, visiting France and Germany. He was planning to continue on to visit Russia when recalled to Japan over rising tensions with China. In November 1894, Ōdera was promoted to major general and made commander of the IJA 11th Infantry Regiment. Under his command were cavalry detachments led by Nogi Maresuke and Akiyama Yoshifuru. Ōdera has praised by French military observers by his cool demeanor when under fire, calmly smoking a cigarette while enemy bullets fell all around him. He reportedly responded by saying that he was not strong - only the smell of smoke from his cigarette was strong. While leading his troops during the Battle of Weihaiwei in the First Sino-Japanese War against the land fortifications guarding the naval base, his position was hit by shrapnel from an artillery shell fired by the Beiyang fleet cruiser Jiyuan. Ōdera was the only Japanese general killed in combat during the war. Ōdera was posthumously promoted to 3rd Court rank, and his son was ennobled with the title of baron (danshaku) under the kazoku peerage system. Ōdera’s grave is at Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo, and some of his personal effects are on display at the Yūshūkan Museum associated with Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo.

It was affiliated with the Kuomintang and was supported by mostly Khampas, with the Pandatsang family playing a key role. Names The Tibetan, Chinese, and English versions of the party names all have separate meanings. The Chinese name () means \\"Tibet Revolutionary Party\\".Original from the University of Michigan In English, it is known as the Tibet Improvement Party or alternatively the Tibetan Progressive Party.Original from Northwestern University The Tibetan name () translates as \\"Western Tibet Reform Party\\". Background Gendün Chöpel The party was founded in 1939 in Kalimpong in India by Pandatsang Rapga, who came from the extensive Pandatsang family, a wealthy wool merchant family from Kham. The other core members of the movement were Thubten Kunphela, the Buddhist reformist monk Gendün Chöpel and the poet Canlocen. Kunphela was the most powerful man in Tibet after the 13th Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso, in the period between 1931 and 1933. After the death of the Dalai Lama, Kunphela lost his dominant position and was exiled. In 1937 he managed to flee and settled in Kalimpong. Beliefs The party considered the then government of Tibet as entirely outdated and feudal, and sought a modern, secular government which would improve infrastructure, introduce newer technology, better education, and a standing army. Pandatsang Rapga was strongly influenced by the ideas of Sun Yat-sen, especially his Three Principles of the People doctrine. He believed that change in Tibet would only be possible in a manner similar to when the Qing Dynasty was overthrown in China, and borrowed the theories and ideas of the Kuomintang as the basis for his model for Tibet. The party was funded by the Kuomintang and by the Pandatsang family. It was said that Rapga \\"was a devout believer in the political ideology of Sun Yat-sen and had translated some of Sun's more important writings into Tibetan\\", including the Three Principles of the People. The Kuomintang General Huang Musong, who was also Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, talked Rapga into traveling to China in 1936 to join the commission. The Tibet Improvement Party had \\"a hundred or so sympathizers among Khamba traders\\" according to Melvyn C. Goldstein. Rapga hailed the three principles of Dr. Sun for helping Asian peoples against foreign imperialism and called for the feudal system to be overthrown. In addition, he stated that \\"The Sanmin Zhuyi was intended for all peoples under the domination of foreigners, for all those who had been deprived of the rights of man. But it was conceived especially for the Asians. It is for this reason that I translated it. At that time, a lot of new ideas were spreading in Tibet\\", during an interview in 1975 by Dr. Heather Stoddard. The ultimate goal of the party regarding the future of Tibet was that Tibet would become an autonomous republic within the Republic of China. Rapga stated that the party goal was revolution and \\"liberation of Tibet from the existing tyrannical government\\". It is difficult to appraise the actual political power of the party. The Tibetan government of the Dalai Lama controlled the western part of Kham, which was one third of the entire Kham region, however, there was significantly large support for some ideas of the movement. The relationship between many Khampas and the Tibetan government in Lhasa was very negative. Hundreds of traders from Kham and a section of the Pandatsang family saw the party as an instrument to create an independent Kham state equally independent of both China and the Dalai Lama's Tibetan state. The 9th Panchen Lama Thubten Choekyi Nyima, who was also pro-Chinese and worked with the Republic of China, also adopted the ideas of Sun Yat-sen like Rapga. Activities The Republic of China Kuomintang government under Chiang Kai-shek sought to extend Chinese influence in Tibet. Chiang covertly propped up and financed Rapga and his movement. Rapga wanted to battle the Tibetan Army with a pro-China Khampa militia, seeking Chiang's assistance in September 1943 right before the Cairo Conference. Rapga used the term \\"hopelessly ill-suited for the modern world\\" to describe the Tibetan government of the Dalai Lama. The Tibet Improvement Party openly supported the Kuomintang and the Republic of China against the Lhasa government of Tibet. Chiang gave a Chinese passport to Rapga, as well as 100,000 yuan every month. In 1945, Rapga sent Gendün Chöphel on a mission to Lhasa via Tawang and Bhutan to draw maps of the area, while masquerading as a pilgrim beggar monk. When Rapga placed a request for 2,000 membership cards and 4,000 membership forms, the British official H. E. Richardson caught wind of his activities in Kalimpong and the existence of the Tibet Improvement Party. The British deliberated among themselves whether the Tibetan government should be tipped off about the party. The Tibet Improvement Party was reported to the Tibetan government on 10 April by Richardson. The extradition of Rapga was then demanded by the Tibetan government on 26 April, but since Rapga declared himself a national of China, Richardson could not go through with the extradition, advising deportation to China instead. Rapga's house was raided on 19 June 1946 for plotting revolution, counterfeiting, and spying, by the police under British orders. Rapga destroyed all relevant party documents beforehand since he was tipped off by the Chinese commissioner in Delhi, but the police searched a suit pocket and found letters documenting Rapga's correspondence with the Chinese over the Tibet Improvement Party. Rapga was ordered to be deported from British India. He requested assistance from the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission in China to halt the deportation. The end of the movement The activities of the party in Kalimpong were eventually noticed by the British. This led to the Tibetan Government becoming aware of the existence of the movement, and in particular of Pandatsang Rapga. The Tibetans demanded the extradition of Rapga to Tibet. This was not possible however, since Pandatsang was in possession of a Chinese passport. He was expelled from British India in 1947 to Shanghai. Kunphela was also expelled and went to Nanjing. In 1946, Gendün Chöpel disguised as a monk and went to Tibet on behalf of Rapga, to gather intelligence and support for the party. However, he was quickly arrested by the Tibetans and imprisoned until 1950. This event led to the end of the movement. References * Goldstein, Melvyn C.

Although MGM records do not state whether the film was profitable, the cost of $892,000 makes it likely it incurred a loss. Critical response Film critic Bosley Crowther panned the film. He wrote, \\"And childish it is, beyond question, despite the promising' presence in the cast of John Hodiak, Frances Gifford, George Murphy and other minor 'names.' It's a 'stream of consciousness' fable about a lawyer's neglected wife who takes up with a night-club owner and gets into a most embarrassing jam. It is unmercifully slow and sombre and utterly devoid of surprise.\\"Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, September 13, 1947. Accessed: August 11, 2013. Variety magazine was more positive. The staff wrote, \\"Arch Oboler, radio’s master of suspense, has effectively transposed his technique into the visual medium with The Arnelo Affair. Strictly speaking this is not a whodunit, nor can it be catalogued as a psychological suspense picture ... There’s never a question as to who committed the murder, but the crime is secondary to its effect on the characters involved. Until the film’s very climax, no hint is given to the ultimate denouement. Dialogue instills the feeling of action where none exists for much of the footage, and the gab is excellent but for a couple of spots when Oboler gives vent to florid passages.\\"Variety.

October 20, 967Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 5.Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter.), né Li Yiyin (李彝殷), formally the Prince of Xia (夏王), was an ethnically-Dangxiang warlord of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period and the early Song Dynasty, ruling Dingnan Circuit (定難, headquartered in modern Yulin, Shaanxi) from 935 to his death in 967, as its military governor (Jiedushi) in de facto independence.  Background  It is not known when Li Yiyin was born. It is known that he was a son of Li Renfu, who ruled Dingnan Circuit as military governor from 909/910 to 933, and a brother of Li Yichao, who ruled the circuit as military governor from 933 to 935, but it is not clear whether he was an older brother to Li Yichao (as asserted by the Zizhi Tongjian)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. or a younger brother (as asserted by the Old History of the Five Dynasties,Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 132. the New History of the Five Dynasties,New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 40. and the History of SongHistory of Song, vol. 485.). If he were an older brother, then he might have been the Dingnan general referred to in historical records by the nickname of \\"Prince Aluo\\" () in 933, when Li Yichao resisted Later Tang's attempt to dislodge him from Dingnan,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. as Li Yichao was said to be Li Renfu's second son. In any case, during Li Yichao's rule, Li Yiyin served as the commander of the Dingnan army (行軍司馬, Xingjun Sima). When Li Yichao fell ill in 935, he transferred his authorities to Li Yiyin, and then died. Shortly after, then-Later Tang emperor Li Congke commissioned Li Yiyin as the military governor of Dingnan.  As military governor   During Later Jin  In 943—by which time Later Tang had fallen and its former territory was reigned by the Later Jin's emperor Shi Chonggui—there was a plot for an uprising against Li Yiyin's rule, from within Dingnan itself, led by the commander of the headquarters guards, Tuoba Chongbin (). Also part of the plot was Li Yimin () the prefect of Sui Prefecture (綏州, in modern Yulin, part of Dingnan). (Based on Li Yimin's name and position, he was likely a younger brother or cousin of Li Yiyin's.) When the plot was discovered, Li Yimin and five younger brothers fled to Yan Prefecture (延州, in modern Yan'an, Shanxi). Li Yiyin thereafter submitted a petition to Shi, accusing Li Yimin of treason. In order to placate Li Yiyin, Shi arrested and delivered Li Yimin to Dingnan's capital Xia Prefecture (), and Li Yimin was executed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. In 944, during a time that there were major military confrontations between Later Jin and its northern rival, the Khitan Liao Dynasty, which was at that time aiding Yang Guangyuan, a Later Jin general who had rebelled at Pinglu Circuit (平盧, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong), Li Yiyin submitted a report to Shi indicating that he had taken his 40,000 men and made an incursion into Liao territory, across the Yellow River, from his Lin Prefecture (麟州, in modern Yulin). Shi gave him the title of the commander of southwestern forces against the Khitan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284.  During Later Han  In 948—by which time Later Jin had fallen and its former territory was reigned by Later Han's emperor Liu Chengyou—there was an incident in which Li Yiyin mobilized his troops and claimed that he wanted to launch an attack against the Qiang chieftain Yemu (㖡母), stating that three years prior, Yemu had ambushed and killed Sui's prefect Li Renyu () (who, based on name and position, was likely an uncle). The nearby Qing Prefecture (慶州, in modern Qingyang, Gansu), recommended that the Later Han imperial government take precautions (apparently distrusting Li Yiyin's intentions). Liu issued an edict, urging Li Yiyin to stand down, using the rationale that the imperial astronomers had stated that the year was, as a matter of astrology, unsuitable for military actions. That apparently defused the tensions at that time.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 288. Later in the year, the Later Han general Li Shouzhen rebelled at his Huguo Circuit (護國, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). Knowing that Li Yiyin had a rivalry with Gao Yunquan () the military governor of nearby Zhangwu Circuit (彰武, headquartered at Yan Prefecture), Li Shouzhen sent secret emissaries to encourage Li Yiyin to attack Zhangwu. Li Yiyin mobilized his troops and sent them to the borders with Zhangwu, but thereafter, hearing that the Later Han imperial forces, under the command of Guo Wei, had put Huguo's capital Hezhong Municipality () under siege, he withdrew. Gao subsequently submitted an accusation against Li Yiyin to the Later Han imperial government, and Li Yiyin submitted a defense of himself. The Later Han imperial government merely issued statements urging the two circuits to be peaceful with each other. To further placate Li Yiyin, who had developed a reputation for encouraging rebellions so that he could benefit from them, the Later Han imperial government further allocated Jing Prefecture (靜州, in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia) to him in 949. After Guo captured Hezhong and Li Shouzhen committed suicide thereafter, Liu, at Guo's request, bestowed honors on many regional governors, and Li Yiyin received the honorary chancellor title Zhongshu Ling ().  During Later Zhou/Northern Han  In 951, Guo Wei seized the Later Han throne (with Liu Chengyou having been killed earlier after provoking Guo to rebel), establishing Later Zhou.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 290.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 289. Liu Chengyou's uncle Liu Chong (who soon thereafter changed his name to Liu Min), however, declared himself the emperor and the legitimate successor to the throne of Later Han, at his Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi)—although his state is historically generally considered a new separate state (Northern Han) rather than part of the history of Later Han. Li Yiyin initially submitted to Liu Min as a vassal. However, by the time of the middle of the Xiande era (954–963) (which was used by Guo Wei, his adoptive son Guo Rong, and his adoptive grandson (Guo Rong's son) Guo Zongxun), Li Yiyin had apparently submitted to Later Zhou as a vassal, for by that point he carried the Later Zhou-bestowed title of acting Taifu (), in addition to Zhongshu Ling, and had also been created the Prince of Xiping by a Later Zhou emperor. (It is not clear whether Li Yiyin also continued to maintain a sovereign-vassal relationship with Liu Min and his son and successor Liu Jun.)  During Song  In 960, the Later Zhou general Zhao Kuangyin seized the throne from the young emperor Guo Zongxun, ending Later Zhou and starting Song Dynasty as its Emperor Taizu. He bestowed the title of acting Taiwei () on Li Yiyin. Shortly after, Li Yiyin changed his name to Li Yixing, to observe naming taboo for Emperor Taizu's father Zhao Hongyin (). Later in the year, there was apparently an attempt by Northern Han to have its non-Han Chinese tribal troops pillage modern northern Shaanxi region, west of the Yellow River; Li Yixing launched sent his officer Li Yiyu () (probably a brother or a cousin) to Lin Prefecture, which apparently came under siege by the Northern Han forces, and the Northern Han forces withdrew.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 1. In 962, Li Yixing offered 300 horses as a tribute to Emperor Taizu. Emperor Taizu, in return, had a jade belt made to award to Li. When he asked Li's emissary what Li's waist size was, Li's emissary responded that Li had a very wide waist. Emperor Taizu responded, \\"Your commander is a blessed person.\\" (Traditionally, Chinese considered those who have large abdomens to be blessed.) It was said that Li was touched by this gesture.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 2. Li Yixing died in 967. Emperor Taizu posthumously created him the greater title of Prince of Xia, and subsequently commissioned his son Li Kerui as the new military governor of Dingnan.

He taught courses in general entomology, insect systematics, and summer field courses in insect identification. From 1963 to 1967 he served as chair of the Department of Entomology for the University of California at Davis. In 1946 the Department of Entomology established a research-oriented insect collection, and Richard Bohart contributed research material in the Diptera, Hymenoptera and Strepsiptera. Bohart's interests in aculeate wasps resulted in one of the most comprehensive collections in the USA. His contributions to the Department of Entomology led to the dedication of the on campus Bohart Museum of Entomology, named after him in 1986.  Early life Bohart was born in Palo Alto, California, in 1913. As a child he had many interests: playing around with clay, looking at pretty woman, playing sports, and collecting fossils, rocks and bugs. He was known as \\"Dick\\" to friends and family. Research history Bohart's experiences in butterfly collecting transitioned to a more scientific endeavor after making an insect collection to satisfy requirements for a University of California, Berkeley field course in entomology. He found a bee (Andrena) which had a sack-like parasite protruding from its abdomen which was identified by E. C. VanDyke as a female Stylops (order Strepsiptera). This interested Bohart enough to a point where he continued to study Strepsiptera and eventually made them the subject of his Ph.D. thesis in 1938. After he was married, in 1939, and moved to West Los Angeles, Bohart was doing research and teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles. There Bohart was researching the sod webworm that was infesting his own front yard lawn from 1938 to 1941. In November 1942 Bohart was drafted into the US Army then transferred into the US Navy Medical Corps as an ensign. Here he taught malaria and mosquito control at Camp LeJeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina, and then at Marine base, Camp Perry in Williamsburg, Virginia. In the spring of 1944 Bohart was transferred to Washington, D.C., and assigned to Naval Medical Research Unit #2 housed at the National Academy of Sciences. Almost immediately Bohart was sent to Orlando and Tallahassee, Florida, to study mosquitoes for a month. In the fall of 1944 Bohart was assigned abroad to Guam then Okinawa for the purposes of malaria control. In the fall of 1945 Bohart remained in the navy to complete his research on mosquitoes. In the spring of 1946 Bohart was released from the navy with the rank of lieutenant commander and returned to the University of California, Los Angeles. The number of journal article publications authored by Bohart total over 200 over his research career. University of California, Davis career Richard Bohart transferred to the University of California at Davis from the University of California campus in Los Angeles in 1946. As the Davis campus began to declare administrative independence from the campus at Berkeley the departments of entomology at both campuses became independently governed. Bohart became vice chairman of the Davis campus Department of Entomology in 1957. From 1963 to 1967 Bohart served as chair for the Department of Entomology at UC Davis. During the time Bohart spent at the University of California, Davis, he contributed in building the university's insect collection. In the early 1940s the insect collection used for study at UC Davis had a limited number of specimens available. The university's commitment to establish a research- oriented collection in 1946 required that the collection be expanded. Bohart contributed insects in the orders of Diptera, Hymenoptera and Strepsiptera. His interest in aculeate wasps contributed to how comprehensive the collection has become today. The collection is now housed in the university's Bohart Museum of Entomology and is the seventh largest insect collection in North America.

This parasitoid's genus Apocephalus is best known for the \\"decapitating flies\\" that attack a variety of ant species, though A. borealis attacks and alters the behavior of bees and wasps. These flies are colloquially known as zombie flies and the bees they infect are colloquially known as zombees. Association with honey bees has so far only been documented from California, South Dakota, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia (Vancouver Island), and Vermont. History This phorid fly is native to North America, attacking bumble bees and paper wasps. The infection of European honey bees in North America by A. borealis is a recent development that was first discovered by Dr. John Hafernik, who collected some dead specimens near a light source at San Francisco State University's campus. These were placed in a vial and forgotten. About a week later larvae emerged from the dead bees. It is hypothesized that the bumble bee is A. borealis’s native host but may have a host shift to the honeybee. This is shown because A. borealis tend to parasitize bumble bees more often than honeybees because the bumble bee’s larger size allows for greater reproductive success. However, some regions have a greater population of honeybees, which increases the chances of a successful A. borealis infection Information is insufficient to explain why the parasitic fly jumped to its new host, but concern exists that this new host provides an opportunity for the fly to thrive and further threaten the decreasing honey bee population. To identify this fly, DNA barcoding was used, demonstrating that the phorids that emerged from Apis and Bombus had no more than 0.2% (1 bp) divergence among samples. What variation was found was from among those phorids reared from honey bees, rather than between flies reared from honey bees versus bumble bees. Other analyses gave similar results, including morphological criteria, sequencing of 18S rRNA genes, and cross-infection of honey bees using phorids that had emerged from both honeybees and bumblebees, thus confirming that the phorids attacking honey bees are the same species as those attacking bumble bees. As a vector for pathogens It has been shown that this parasite can reduce a bumble bee's lifespan by up to 70%. To make matters worse for the infected hosts, microarray analyses of honey bees from infected hives reveal that these bees are often infected with deformed wing virus and Nosema ceranae. Unfortunately, both larvae and adult phorids have tested positive for these pathogens, implicating the fly as a potential vector or reservoir host of these honey bee pathogens. A. borealis has also been suggested to be a possible vector promoting the spread of the pathogens responsible for colony collapse disorder. Life cycle Eggs are laid in the abdomen of the bee; when the larvae hatch, they feed on flight muscles in the thorax and hemolymph. Development of larvae takes an average of one week. Mature fly larvae typically emerge from the host between the head and thorax (but rarely result in decapitation), and the larvae pupate outside the host body. About 28 days are needed for the entire life cycle. Infected bees can be found walking in circles, as well as losing the ability to stand. Disorientation is likely caused by mechanical interference or by pressure of the growing larvae on the internal organs and nervous system. Inactivity during the daytime, along with activity during cold or inclement weather, has been observed in infected bees. Hive abandonment, particularly at night, has been implicated as a behavior modification of A. borealis. Reasons for abandoning the hive remain unclear. Researchers hypothesized that infected bees may be ejected by their hive mates, with chemosensory particles playing a possible role in detection of infected bees. It is also possible that infected bees altruistically remove themselves from the hive in efforts to stop the spread of disease to the bee colony. A bee leaving the hive and going towards a light source at night has yet to be observed. However, many dead bees have been observed near light sources, and when collected many of these bees show evidence of being parasitized, leading to the conclusion that parasitized bees might be drawn to light sources at night. The mechanisms of this phenomenon have yet to be analyzed, but possible culprits are mechanical interference of the larva growing within the bee or a response to chemical signals the larva are emitting in the bee. Effect of seasons The rates of infection in honey bees fluctuate as A. borealis populations increase and decline over the seasons. No adults of the fly were found within hives, indicating that phorids do not survive in large numbers in the late winter when foraging bees are inactive.

Zombee Watch A citizen science project, \\"Zombee Watch\\", uses a social media framework for people to report sightings of potentially parasitized bees.

He was pro-Kuomintang and pro-Republic of China, anti-feudal, anti-communist. He believed in overthrowing the Dalai Lama's feudal regime and driving British imperialism out of Tibet, and acted on behalf of Chiang Kai-shek in countering the Dalai Lama. He was later involved in rebelling against communist rule. Background He belonged to a branch of the large Pandatsang clan, who hailed from Kham. Pandatsang means \\"House of Pangda\\" in Kham. The Pandatsang were an extremely rich Khampa trading family with enormous influence in Kham. The family leader was Nyigyal. The family's servants were known to often boast \\"Sa spang mda' gnam spang mda'\\", meaning \\"The earth is Pangda's, the sky is Pangda's\\", and \\"I am connected to Pangda, what are you going to do to me?\\" They were behind the rebellion against Lhasa in 1934 and the Tibet Improvement Party. Rapga was the brother of Pandastang Togbye, who was a great friend of Thubten Kunphela who was from Nyemo county, located between Shigatse and Lhasa, U-Tsang. Partly out of anger over Kunphela's fall from power after the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso, Togbye organized a revolt in 1934 against the Tibetan government within areas they controlled in the western part of Kham, roughly one third of the entire Kham region. His brother had military control while Rapga was more of a \\"scholar\\". They aimed to ultimately attack Lhasa, and were required to take Chamdo first.Original from the University of Michigan He did so in the belief that many monks from Kham originating in the large monasteries near Lhasa would support him in this. The Tibetan government knew that the rebellion originated from within Kham. The residence of his family in Lhasa was confiscated, but ultimately negotiations ensued. The reason was that the family was the main exporter of Tibetan wool abroad, and any further incident could affect government funds. As a result of the outcome of the negotiations, the members of the family did not pursue the rebellion further. While the Kham rebels were escaping from the Tibetan government forces, they were forced into battle against both the Sichuan warlord Liu Wenhui and the Chinese Communist party forces which were on the Long March. Rapga fled from Kham to Kalimpong via Kanting and Nanking after the revolt failed. In India In 1935 Pandatsang Rapga left to India. Some time later, he went to Chongqing, which served as the wartime capital for the Kuomintang Republic of China government during the Second Sino-Japanese War, where he joined the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission of the Republic of China government. In 1939 he left again to return to Kalimpong in India. The Tibet Improvement Party In 1939 he eventually founded the Tibet Improvement Party in Kalimpong, in British India. The monk Gendün Chöphel, the exiled Thubten Kunphela (; ), and the poet Canlocen (; ) joined as members of the revolutionary party, which sought to topple the Tibetan government in Lhasa and reform Tibet, and sought to \\"oust the British from India\\". The party considered the then government of Tibet as entirely outdated, religious and feudal, and sought a more modern, secular government which would pay attention to improving infrastructure, such as the introduction of more advanced technology, better education, and a modern standing army. The ultimate goal of the party regarding the future of Tibet was that Tibet would become an autonomous republic within the Republic of China. The reform of the Buddhist religion in Tibet and the liberation of Tibet from the existing tyrannical Government‟ and the revolutionary restructuring of the Tibetan government and society\\", were among the goals that the Tibet Improvement Party wanted to accomplish. The Party advocated reform by \\"giving the monks salaries instead of estates and requiring them to study instead of engaging in business\\". Rapga would attempt to attain his aims for Tibet with the Kuomintang's help. Pandatsang Rapga was strongly influenced by the ideas of Sun Yat-sen, especially his Three Principles of the People doctrine. He believed that change in Tibet would only be possible in a manner similar to when the Qing Dynasty was overthrown in China. He borrowed the theories and ideas of the Kuomintang as the basis for his model for Tibet. The party was funded by the Kuomintang and by the Pandatsang family. In 1943 Rapga requested that China help him achieve revolution against the ruling Tibetan authorities in Lhasa as dissent grew among the Tibetan population, and face off against the Tibetan army with his own Kham militia. Chiang Kai-shek received a classified report on these plans from Wu Zhongxin in October 1943. Chiang then gave Rapga a Chinese passport, a salary of 100,000 each month via the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and the cooperation of his secret agents in India, Tibet, and Xikang. In 1945, Rapga sent Gendün Chöphel on a mission to Lhasa via Tawang and Bhutan to draw maps of the area, while masquerading as a pilgrim beggar monk. When Rapga placed a request for 2,000 membership cards and 4,000 membership forms, the British official H. E. Richardson caught wind of his activities in Kalimpong and the existence of the Tibet Improvement Party. The British deliberated among themselves whether the Tibetan government should be tipped off about the party. The Tibet Improvement Party was reported to the Tibetan government on 10 April by Richardson. The extradition of Rapga was then demanded by the Tibetan government on 26 April, but since Rapga declared himself a national of China Richardson could not go through with the extradition, advising deportation to China instead. Rapga's house was raided on June 19, 1946 for plotting revolution, counterfeiting, and spying, by the police under British orders. Rapga destroyed all relevant party documents beforehand since he was tipped off by the Chinese commissioner in Delhi, but the police searched a suit pocket and found letters documenting Rapga's correspondence with the Chinese over the Tibet Improvement Party. Rapga was ordered to be deported from British India. He requested assistance from the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission in China to halt the deportation. The British collected information on Rapga under a file titled \\"Chinese intrigues and Tibetan subversives (Rapga)\\". Other people affiliated with the Tibet Improvement Party like Abdul Wahid Ladakche, Jampa Wosel, and Kumphel La (Thubten Kunphela)'s activities were also put under surveillance by the British. Pandatsang hailed the Three Principles of Dr. Sun for helping Asian peoples against foreign imperialism and called for the feudal system to be overthrown. Rapga stated that \\"The Sanmin Zhuyi was intended for all peoples under the domination of foreigners, for all those who had been deprived of the rights of man. But it was conceived especially for the Asians. It is for this reason that I translated it. At that time, a lot of new ideas were spreading in Tibet\\", during an interview in 1975 by Dr. Heather Stoddard. The party had some tensions regarding financing. A section of Pandatsang's family saw the party as an instrument to create an independent Kham state equally independent of both China and the Dalai Lama's Tibet. The activities of the party were eventually noticed by the British. That led to the Tibetan government becoming aware of the existence of the party and in particular, Pandatsang Rapga. The Tibetans demanded that he be extradited to Tibet, however, it was not possible, due to Rapga possessing a Chinese passport. In 1947, British India expelled him to Shanghai. Return to Kham In 1950, Rapga travelled to Chamdo, which is located on the border between the part of Kham controlled by the Tibetan government, and the part which was independent of their control.Original from the University of Michigan Original from the University of Michigan The People's Liberation Army had occupied Kham without much opposition from the Khampas. The relationship between the Khampa and the Tibetan 14th Dalai Lama government in Lhasa was extremely poor at the time. Rapga offered the governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Ngawang Jigme, some Khampa fighters in exchange for the Tibetan government recognizing the independence of Kham. Ngabo refused the offer. After the defeat of the Tibetan Army in Chamdo, Rapga started mediating in negotiations between the People's Liberation Army and the Tibetans. Rapga and Topgay engaged in negotiations with the Chinese during the Battle of Chamdo. Khampas either defected to the Chinese PLA forces or did not fight at all. The PLA succeeded in the invasion. The Khampa Tibetans and Lhasa Tibetans held each other in mutual contempt and dislike, with the Khampa in some cases hating Lhasa rule even more than Chinese rule, which was why the Khampa did little to resist Chinese forces as they entered Kham and subsequently took over the entire Tibet. Rapga stayed independent in his own ideology and politics, refusing to join the Dalai Lama's elder brother Gyalo Thondup in an endeavour in which Gyalo proposed that all different Tibetan factions unite against China and pressure India to act over China's control of Tibet. Rapga participated in raising Khampa rebels to fight against the Communists during the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion. Rapga continued to cooperate with the Republic of China Kuomintang government after it fled to Taiwan, who had also provided training to Khampa rebels against the Communist PLA forces. Rapga claimed to have 100,000 troops under his control. The Republic of China on Taiwan had a dispute with the United States as to whether Tibet would be independent, since the ROC government claimed Tibet as part of its territory. Rapga agreed to a plan in which the revolt against the Communists would include anti-feudalism, land reform, a modern government, and to give power to the people. As late as the 1970s, Rapga believed that Sun Yat-sen's three principles were the best hope for Asian peoples against feudalism and foreign imperialism. References * Goldstein, Melvyn C.

Birkenfeld had been bypassed by the Nahetalbahn (Nahe Valley Railway) due to routing difficulties. Since Birkenfeld was part of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, a treaty had to be signed with Prussia in order to build the railway. The City of Birkenfeld saw the line as essential to its economic survival. Birkenfeld mayor Eissel had the railway licensed on December 2, 1879, and commissioned on October 15, 1880. At that time the railway was called the Birkenfelder Zweigbahn (Birkenfeld Branch Railway). The Königlich Preußische Eisenbahn-Verwaltung (KPEV) (Royal Prussian Railway Administration) and later the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG) (German Empire Railway Administration) maintained the privately held railway. In 1932, the DRG abandoned the railway due to low traffic. On December 31, 1933, the Birkenfelder Lokalbahn GmbH (Birkenfeld Local Railway Company), later to be called the Birkenfelder Eisenbahn GmbH (Birkenfeld Railway Company), was formed. The shareholders in the railway were the City of Birkenfeld with a 72 percent share and Degussa with a 28 percent share. Degussa had a siding to service its factory in Brücken. With the closing of Degussa, the line was exclusively owned by Bikenfeld from July 19, 1969, onward. On December 31, 1962, passenger service on the line was completely replaced by bus. This process began on October 2, 1955. The last freight train service was on September 30, 1991. The line was officially closed on December 31, 1994. Since then the rails have been removed. Today a bike and walking trail are on the former railway’s right-of-way.

Once Vishnu was inflicted with fever of Javarasura, when in form of Haya-griva. He killed the fever-demon, Jvarasura. by cutting him into three pieces using his cosmic-disk weapon, the Sudarshana Chakra. However, Jvarasura was later revived by Brahma, who joined the three parts. But by that time each three parts had grown head and limbs. Thus Jvarasura is depicted as having three faces, three feet and remarkable ability to move in all directions at once. He was later selected as consort of pox-goddess, Shitala. The cult of Shitala-Jvarasura is widely popular in Bengali culture. Incidentally, in Bengali, Oriya and Hindi languages, fever is referred to as Jvara. and Asura means demon.

Jvarasura is disguised as a young servant. Shitala, the consort of Jvarasura is widely worshipped by village folk in whole of North India, as a protector of pox and fever diseases. In Buddhism In Buddhist culture, Jvarasura is depicted sometimes as consort of Paranasabari, the Buddhist Goddess of diseases.

Background  It is not known when Li Shenfu was born, but it is known that he was from Ming Prefecture (洺州, in modern Handan, Hebei). He became a soldier in the army of Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), which Ming Prefecture belonged to, and was later posted to Huainan Circuit when Gao Pian the military governor of Huainan served as the overall commander of the operations against the agrarian rebel Huang Chao.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (十國春秋), vol. 5.Gao Pian served as the overall commander of the operations against Huang Chao from 880 to 882. Therefore, Li Shenfu's posting to Huainan must have happened sometime between those years. See Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 253, 255. He was later assigned to Lu Prefecture (廬州, in modern Hefei, Anhui) to serve under Gao's subordinate Yang Xingmin (who would later be renamed Yang Xingmi) the prefect of Lu.  Service under Yang Xingmi   Initial service  In 884, there was an occasion when the agrarian rebel Chen Ru () attacked Shu Prefecture (舒州, in modern Anqing, Anhui); Shu's prefect Gao Yu (高澞, Gao Pian's nephew) sought aid from Yang Xingmi. Yang consulted with Li Shenfu, who stated that he could repel Chen without fighting. Yang thus sent Li to aid Gao Yu. Li took many banners bearing the insignia of the Lu army and secretly got into Shu's main city. He then gave the banners to the Shu soldiers, and the Shu soldiers thereafter advanced out of the city bearing the Lu banners. The rebels under Chen, believing that a large detachment had arrived from Lu, fled.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255. In 886, Zhang Ao () the prefect of Shou Prefecture (壽州, in modern Lu'an, Anhui) sent his officer Wei Qian () to attack Lu. Yang sent Li, Tian Jun, and Zhang Xun () to resist, and they repelled Wei's attack.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256.  During the campaign against Sun Ru  In 887, a mutiny by the Huainan officer Bi Shiduo against Gao Pian and Gao's favorite sorcerer Lü Yongzhi triggered an internecine war that had Bi, Lü, Yang Xingmi, and Qin Yan contending for the control of Huainan, which eventually was taken by Sun Ru.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. Yang, in turn, advanced south and took Ningguo Circuit (寧國, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui) and became its military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. In 891, Sun took his army and advanced south, intending to destroy Yang. In an initial confrontation, Li Shenfu surprised Sun's advance troops and defeated them. Later in the year, Yang also sent Li to attack He (和州, in modern Chaohu, Anhui) and Chu (滁洲, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui) Prefectures, defeating the Sun-commissioned prefects Kang Wang () and An Jingsi (); Kang surrendered, and An fled. By spring 892, however, with Sun's much larger army approaching Ningguo's capital Xuan Prefecture (), Yang considered abandoning Xuan Prefecture and fleeing, but did not do so after Li and Liu Wei () advised against it. Yang thereafter was able to bog Sun's attack down, and defeated and killed Sun in a decisive battle in fall 892.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259.  Campaigns against Cai Chou  After Sun Ru's defeat, Cai Chou (), whom Yang Xingmi had previously made the prefect of Lu but who then surrendered to Sun when Sun attacked, tried to submit to Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan). Zhu, however, considered Cai unreliable and refused to launch an army to aid Cai, and instead informed what Cai was doing to Yang. Yang thereafter sent Li Shenfu to attack Cai. Later, Tian Jun and Yang himself also joined Li's siege of Lu Prefecture. In fall 893, the city fell, and Yang executed Cai. Subsequently, Cai's ally Ni Zhang () the prefect of Shu Prefecture fled. Yang thus made Li the prefect of Shu.  Campaigns against Qian Liu  In fall 901, Yang received a (false) report that Qian Liu the military governor of Zhenhai (鎮海, headquartered in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang) and Zhendong (鎮東, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang) Circuits had been assassinated. He thus sent Li to try to take Zhenhai's capital Hang Prefecture () in (what he thought to be) the confusion of Qian's death. Qian sent the general Gu Quanwu () to resist him. They stalemated for some time. Li then allowed captives from Gu's army to overhear a conversation in which he stated that he was going to retreat that night due to the length of the stalemate, and then allowed the captives to flee. He then began what appeared to be a withdraw, but had his subordinate Lü Shizao () lay a trap for Gu. Gu, who did not respect Li, gave chase, and fell into the trap that Li and Lü had set. Li soundly defeated Gu's army and captured him. Li then attacked Lin'an (臨安, in modern Hangzhou, Qian's hometown), but could not capture it quickly. By this point, he had found out that Qian had not died, and so wanted to withdraw, but he feared that Qian would give chase. He therefore carefully protected the tombs of Qian's ancestors and allowed Gu, whom Qian valued greatly, to write letters to report that he was safe. Qian sent an emissary to thank Li. When Li pretended to have received a large reinforcement from Huainan, Qian sued for peace and sent gifts. Li, after receiving Qian's gifts, withdrew.Zizhi Tongjian, 262. In 902, Yang made Li the prefect of Sheng Prefecture (昇州, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263.  Campaigns against Du Hong  In spring 903, Yang Xingmi made Li Shenfu the commander (行軍司馬, Xingjun Sima) of the Huainan army and put him in command of an army to attack Du Hong the military governor of Wuchang Circuit (武昌, headquartered in modern Wuhan, Hubei), with Liu You () serving as his deputy. He quickly captured Yongxing (永興, in modern Huanggang, Hubei), cutting off the food supplies for Wuchang. He then put Wuchang's capital E Prefecture () under siege.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. Du sought aid from Zhu Quanzhong, but at that time, Zhu was only able to send a small detachment commanded by Han Qing (), who could not lift the siege. Zhu thereafter made requests to Cheng Rui the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (荊南, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), Ma Yin the military governor of Wu'an Circuit (武安, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan), and Lei Yanwei the military governor of Wuzhen Circuit (武貞, headquartered in modern Changde, Hunan), asking them to save Du. Only Cheng launched a fleet to try to save Du, though. Further, as soon as Cheng left his capital Jiangling, Ma's officer Xu Dexun and Lei's officer Ouyang Si () rendezvoused and jointly attacked Jiangling, sacking it and taking its population and treasures before withdrawing. When the news arrived at Cheng's fleet, Cheng's soldiers' morale was destroyed. Li subsequently crushed him, and he committed suicide by drowning. When Han heard of Cheng's death, he also withdrew, leaving Du with no aid.  Campaigns against Tian Jun  However, another event would (for the time being) save Du. Tian Jun, who was the military governor of Ningguo at the time under Yang, had long wanted to expand his territory but was repeatedly curbed in that ambition by Yang, and therefore began to resent Yang. Li, seeing this, had warned Yang about Tian and urged Yang to react preemptively, but Yang refused, pointing out that Tian had great contributions and that acting against him first would destroy the army morale. In fall 903, Tian and An Renyi () the military prefect of Run Prefecture (潤州, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) rose against Yang. In light of Tian's rebellion, Yang ordered Li to withdraw from Wuchang and attack Ningguo. Fearing that Du would attack him from the rear, Li announced to his soldiers that he was heading west to seize Jingnan, and only after he was out of E Prefecture's vicinity did he inform the soldiers of Tian's rebellion and their actual mission. Meanwhile, Tian had launched a surprise attack on Sheng Prefecture and taken Li's wife and children. He initially treated them well, and he sent an emissary to Li, stating, \\"If you, Lord, take this opportunity properly, I will divide the lands with you so that we can both be princes. If not, your wife and children will not survive.\\" Li stated to his army, Li executed Tian's emissary and continued to advance toward Ningguo, encountering Tian's officers Wang Tan () and Wang Jian () at Jiyang Banks (吉陽磯, in modern Chizhou, Anhui). When Wang Tan and Wang Jian displayed Li's son Li Chengding () on the battlefield, Li ordered his soldiers to fire arrows anyway. He thereafter engaged Wang Tan and Wang Jian and pretended to suffer initial losses. He then pretended to retreat, inducing Wang Tan and Wang Jian to chase him, and then counterattacked, inflicting heavy losses on them. When Tian heard this, he personally led a fleet against Li. Li initially set up camps and refused to engage Tian, while sending suggestions to Yang that he use this opportunity to send another general to directly attack Xuan Prefecture. Yang thereafter sent Tai Meng () and Wang Maozhang to do so. Tian, hearing that Tai was heading directly toward Xuan Prefecture, withdrew to engage Tai, while leaving Wang Tan, Wang Jian, and Guo Xingcong () at Wuhu (蕪湖, in modern Wuhu, Anhui) to defend against Li. When Tai subsequently defeated him at Guangde (廣德, in modern Xuancheng) and forced him to flee back to Xuan Prefecture to defend it, Wang Tan, Wang Jian, and Guo surrendered to Li. Subsequently, when Tian made one final attempt to counterattack against Tai, Tai defeated him again and killed him on the battlefield. His soldiers surrendered, allowing the Huainan army to retake Ningguo. Yang commissioned Li as the new military governor of Ningguo, but Li, pointing out that he had not yet defeated Du, refused to accept the position, and instead headed west again to attack Du.  Death  In summer 904, while sieging E Prefecture, Li fell ill and returned to Huainan's capital Guangling (). Yang sent Liu Cun to replace him as the commander of the operations against Du. Li died soon thereafter. (Liu would capture E Prefecture in spring 905, allowing Wuchang to come under Yang's control.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265.

It was part of the Special Branch, and worked closely with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). It operated from 1968 to 2008. History The SDS was established by Special Branch as the Special Operations Squad in March 1968. Formed as a response to the anti-war demonstrations held outside the US Embassy in Grosvenor Square, London, the squad's purpose was to infiltrate \\"left-wing direct-action groups\\" using undercover police officers (nicknamed \\"hairies\\" because of their hippie appearance), who would liaise with MI5. In 1972 it was renamed the Special Demonstration Squad. It was renamed the Special Duties Squad in 1997 and disbanded in 2008. Activities The SDS used the names of 80 dead children to create false identities for its operatives. Some members of the SDS engaged in sexual relationships with protest organisers in an attempt to gain trust, and in some cases fathered children by them. In 2013, former SDS undercover officer Peter Francis revealed that the SDS investigated the family of Stephen Lawrence in order to seek possible evidence to smear Lawrence with in case of racially motivated public order issues. The revelation of this information led to Home Secretary Theresa May announcing an investigation in Parliament, while Stephen Lawrence's father Neville Lawrence arguing that the allegations merited an independent investigation. In the documentary broadcast as part of Channel 4's Dispatches programme, Francis confirmed that allegations made about officers having relationships with women involved with political protest movements were true. After its closure in 2008 the role of the SDS was taken up in part by the National Domestic Extremism Unit. Aftermath Litigation On 23 October 2014, the Metropolitan Police Service agreed to pay £425,000 to a woman called Jacqui whose child was fathered by former SDS operative Bob Lambert; she did not know at the time of their relationship that he was an undercover police officer. The payment was part of an agreement for her to drop her legal action alleging assault, negligence, deceit and misconduct by senior officers. She was a 22-year-old activist at the time of her relationship with Lambert – who was using the pseudonym Bob Robinson – and she gave birth to their son in 1985. When the boy was two years old his father vanished, and she told BBC News she had received psychiatric care after learning the officer's real identity. The unprecedented payment resulted from a legal battle with women who said they were duped into relationships with officers who were spying on them. Scotland Yard said it \\"unreservedly apologises for any pain and suffering\\" but added that \\"the Metropolitan Police Service has never had a policy that officers can use sexual relations for the purposes of policing\\". Scotland Yard had previously refused to either confirm or deny whether Bob Lambert was an SDS operative, despite his own admissions to journalists. However, it was forced to change its position in August 2014 after a legal ruling. Mr Lambert did not responded to BBC requests for comment on the settlement but had previously said that he wanted to apologise to women with whom he had relationships and that he had made some \\"serious mistakes\\". At the time of the October 2014 settlement there were 12 other legal claims relating to undercover officers still being fought. But Jules Carey of Bindmans lawyers, acting for Jacqui, said the legal battles so far suggested Scotland Yard wanted to maintain a \\"never say never\\" stance to sexual relations after the Met's lawyers argued there could be a hypothetical extreme situation where such a tactic was needed. Mr Carey said: \\"The Metropolitan Police are prepared to criticise the conduct of an individual officer, Bob Lambert. They are even prepared to be critical of the unit he was from – but they refuse to condemn the practice itself. It is time for the commissioner of Metropolitan Police to publicly commit to seeing the end of this shameful and abusive practice\\". In December 2018, the High Court ruled against a request that the Crown Prosecution Service should prosecute SDS officer Jim Boyling for the offences of rape, indecent assault, procurement of sexual intercourse and misconduct in public office. Apology Officer John Dines had a two- year relationship with campaigner Helen Steel while working undercover for the SDS. In 2016, Steel tracked down Dines in Australia; he apologised from the emotional suffering caused. In popular culture In early 2014 a television drama series was announced based on the Special Demonstration Squad officers and their long-term relationships with activists upon whom they were spying. The working title was Undercovers with writing to be done by Simon Beaufoy, Alice Nutter, and Franny Armstrong who had previously worked on McLibel. The series was scheduled to be produced by Spanner Films with Tony Garnett as the executive producer. A TV series based on this, along with Stephen Lawrence's family being spied on, was aired in 2016 as Undercover.

Texas is a large state, and its cuisine has been influenced by a wide range of cultures, including Southern, German, Czech, British, African American, Creole/Cajun, Mexican, Native American, Asian, and to a lesser degree, Jewish and Italian. Agriculture In the 1880s citrus growers in Texas and Florida discovered pink-fleshed seedless grapefruit mutations like the Ruby. Early varieties like the Duncan had many seeds and pale flesh.  Specialties   Barbecue  Barbecue meats and sausage at a restaurant in Texas Texas barbecue was influenced by the cooking technique barbacoa, a method of slow cooking meat that has been wrapped in leaves in a covered pit. In the 19th century, cowboys developed techniques to cook the tough beef from range cattle over coals and colonial style open pit barbecue was brought to the state when blacks arrived from the southeast, but later developed into closed pit Western-style barbecue which uses indirect heat instead of coals and imparts a smokier flavor. Near the end of the century immigrants from Germany and eastern Europe introduced their own distinctive culinary traditions, including sausage making, marked by bold and sometimes piquant spicing and coarser texture, which became part of Texan barbecue culture and smoked sausage remains a popular dish at Western- style barbecues.The Oxford Companion to American Food Early American traditional whole hog barbecues and later rib barbecues were prepared with pork, and Texas is among a handful of states that develop an early preference for beef barbecue, though goat is used as well. Beef brisket (slowly cooked in smoke in a wood-fired \\"pit\\") is the most common barbecue. Barbecue in Texas is most commonly served with white bread, spicy sauces, pickles, sliced onion, and jalapeños; sides include pinto beans, potato or rice salad, and cabbage slaw. Common desserts served with barbecue are fruit cobbler, banana pudding, and pecan pie. Dessert and pastry Fried sopapillas pastries Czech immigrants brought a tradition of pastry-making including fruit-filled kolaches and sausage-filled klobasniky, pastries. The Texas Legislature has declared West, Texas is the \\"Home of the Official Kolache of the Texas Legislature,\\" while Caldwell, Texas is \\"Kolache Capital of Texas.\\" Strudel was brought to Texas by European immigrants. Sopapillas are a simple fried pastry dough sweetened with sugar and cinnamon. The dish has roots in a lard-fried pastry made by the Tigua Pueblo people for Franciscan friars in Ysleta, El Paso. This early form of the pastry dates to at least 1682 making it one of the earliest pastries known found in Texan cuisine. Texan peanut butter pie Pecan pie is the official state pie of Texas. The crust for another local specialty, peanut butter pie, is made with crushed vanilla wafers and peanuts. The filling is a sweetened peanut butter pudding made with milk, sugar, peanut butter, corn starch and egg yolks. Though the origin of the term Texas sheet cake is unknown, with some speculating it's a reference to the cake's large size or decadence, and others who believe it's because the cake includes Texas-style ingredients like buttermilk and pecans, the cake has become a popular dessert throughout the United States since the original recipe was published by The Dallas Morning News in 1957. Peach cobbler is the official cobbler.  Hamburger  The earliest claim to the invention of the hamburger was Fletcher Davis of Athens, Texas, who was claimed to have served it at his restaurant at a time when there were more cows than people in Texas. According to oral histories, in the 1880s, he opened a lunch counter in Athens and served a \\"burger\\" of fried ground beef patties with mustard and Bermuda onion between two slices of bread; with a pickle on the side. The claim is that in 1904, Davis and his wife Ciddy ran a sandwich stand at the St. Louis World's Fair. Historian Frank X. Tolbert noted that Athens resident Clint Murchison said his grandfather dated the hamburger to the 1880s with \\"Old Dave\\" a.k.a. Fletcher Davis. A photo of \\"Old Dave's Hamburger Stand\\" from the 1904 connection was sent to Tolbert as evidence of the claim. Also the New York Tribune namelessly attributed the innovation of the hamburger to the stand on the pike.  Southern  European settlers and African slaves brought the culinary traditions of the Deep South with them including biscuits, red-eye gravy, pan-fried chicken, black-eyed peas, mashed potatoes, cornbread or corn pone, sweet tea, and desserts like peach cobbler and pecan pie. Even after emancipation many African slaves who had been cooks and domestic servants were not able to afford the highest quality meats and are recognized for the skilled preparation of simple ingredients like greens and beans flavored with salt pork, hog jowl, peppers and spices. These staple dishes were served alongside game meats, fried chicken and fried catfish. French immigrants from Louisiana introduced influences from Cajun and Louisiana Creole cuisine. Some claim the corn dog was invented by vendors at the Texas State Fair. Confederate cush is a dish associated with Confederate troops, the preparation of which was described by one Texas native in 1863 as follows: \\"chop up a small quantity of fat bacon into a frying pan, get the grease all out of it, put in a quart of water, when it boils crumble in cold corn bread and stir until dry\\". Fried okra is a quintessential side dish throughout the American South, including Texas. Hybrid cuisines Chicken fried steak with cream gravy served at a restaurant in Austin, Texas Dating back to the era of French and Spanish colonial rule in Texas, relations between ethnic groups have been tense throughout history, but despite these animosities different ethnic groups have enjoyed food from varied cuisines and incorporated borrowed ingredients into their own, contributing to Texas' varied and rich food culture. Tex-Mex is the best known hybrid cuisine from Texas but there are many others with contributions from around thirty ethnic groups including Czech, Korean and in Indian. Korean donut shops sell jalapeño kolaches, Indians make fajitas with chutney and Czech-Tex style hot dogs are topped with both sauerkraut and chili con carne. Other fusion dishes like bulgogi and banh mi burgers can be found as well. The origin of chicken fried steak is unknown, with one view that the dish developed in the cattle country of Texas and the Midwest and another holding that it's variation of German schnitzel.  Tex-Mex  Tex-Mex refers to a style of cooking that combines traditional Northeastern Mexican cuisine that makes heavy use of beef and extremely hot, tiny chiltepin pepper. Combination plates featuring tacos, enchiladas and tostadas served alongside rice and beans are not found in traditional Mexican cuisine. This custom developed only when Mexican American cooks adapted offerings for customers who preferred a full plate, rather than the traditional style of eating small, separate dishes. Commercial manufacture of chili powders began in Texas in the 1890s. Today, chili is the official state dish. Texas is known for its own variation of chili con carne. Texas chili is made typically with hot peppers and beef (or sometimes game meats like venison) and sometimes served with pinto beans, either on the side or in the chili itself (though the latter may be controversial as some believe that a proper Texas chili is made without beans). The dish can be topped with an assortment of garnishes including fresh or pickled jalapeños, raw onions or crumbled soda crackers. Thick chili gravy is served over tamales and enchiladas. Frank X. Tolbert's 1953 recipe included beef kidney suet, ancho chiles and lean beef for stewing such as chuck seasoned with oregano, garlic, cumin and cayenne pepper. Breakfast items include scrambled egg in flour tortilla tacos as migas and huevos con chorizo, huevos rancheros, and empanadas of various meats. King Ranch casserole is made with chicken, cream of mushroom and chicken soups, cheese and tortilla chips. Entrees are commonly accompanied by pan fried potato and refried beans. Ingredients commonly used in Tex-Mex cuisine include goat, chicken, pork, beef, venison, eggs, cheese, milk, beans, masa harina, peppers, chocolate, and various spices.https://texascultures.housing.utexas.edu/assets/pdfs/texas_cuisine.pdf Puffy tacos made with deep fried handmade corn tortillas and served with beef picadillo are a San Antonio specialty. Pan de campo is the official state bread. Also called \\"cowboy bread\\", the simple recipe was traditionally baked in a Dutch Oven. Deserts include flan, tres leches cake, sopapillas and pralines. menudo In the ranch lands of the 1930s, after cattle were butchered, the hide, the head, the entrails, and meat trimmings such as skirt were given to the Mexican cowboys called vaqueros as part of their pay. Hearty dishes like barbacoa de cabeza (barbecued head), menudo (tripe stew), and fajitas or arracheras (grilled skirt steak) have their roots in this practice. Considering the limited number of skirts per carcass and that the meat wasn't available commercially, the fajita tradition remained regional and relatively obscure for many years, probably only familiar to vaqueros, butchers, and their families. Modern \\"fajitas\\" were introduced at a county fair in Kyle, Texas in 1969 by Sonny Falcon, who later opened an Austin restaurant offering fajitas as a main fare. Other dishes associated with Tex-Mex cooking include guacamole, chile con queso, tostadas with red salsa, tortilla soup, nachos, tacos, quesadillas, chimichangas, burritos, and carne guisada. Restaurants and pubs The now defunct Kirby's Pig Stand was the first drive in restaurant in the United States. Founder Jessie G. Kirby reportedly pitched as it to potential investors in Dallas as a type of roadside dining establishment for where people could order and eat without leaving their vehicles. The restaurant served \\"pig sandwich\\" made with roast pork, pickle relish and barbecue sauce. Chinese restaurants serve authentic dishes like hand pulled noodles, char siu barbecue, and Americanized offerings like egg foo young, (brisket) fried rice, chow mein, and chop suey. There are also some restaurants serving spicy Sichuan offerings like ma po tofu and spicy fish in chili oil. Food and beverage industry Dr Pepper was founded in Waco, Texas. The Spoetzl Brewery in Shiner, Texas is the oldest independent brewery in Texas, and produces Shiner Beers, including their flagship Shiner Bock. The frozen margarita machine was invented in Dallas by Mariano Martinez. Frito-Lay is headquartered in Plano, Texas and Frito pie, a dish of Texas chili topped with corn chips cheese, is a popular recipe to serve at large events.

Current name of the plant is ArcelorMittal Poland Dąbrowa Górnicza, and its previous names were Mittal Steel Poland, Ispat Polska Stal S.A., and Polskie Huty Stali S.A.. Contrary to its name, Katowice Steelworks is not located in the city of Katowice, but in Dąbrowa Górnicza, which is located east of Katowice. Katowice Steelworks The decision to build a modern, brand new plant, located in a forested area of Zagłębie Dąbrowskie was taken by Edward Gierek during the VI Congress of Polish United Workers' Party, which took place on December 6–11, 1971. The construction was initiated on April 15, 1972, and it brought far-reaching changes to the social structure of the region. Thousands of migrants, mostly from eastern Poland, came to work and live in newly built flats. Furthermore, additional projects, serving Katowice Steelworks were initiated, such as Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line, which was used to transport iron ore from the Soviet Union. Construction of the plant was carried out with cooperation with Soviet experts, and the honorary title of the First Worker was granted to Leonid Brezhnev. Altogether, some 50,000 workers took part in the project. First unit of the plant was opened in 1975, and in May 1976, Metallurgical Corporation Huta Katowice (Kombinat Metalurgiczny Huta Katowice) was created, which, besides the plant itself, also included Felix Dzerzhinsky Steelwork (now Huta Bankowa) in Dąbrowa Górnicza, and Coke Plant in Zdzieszowice. On December 2, 1976, at 7 a.m., the blast furnace was fired for the first time, and on December 3, 1976, first 30 tons of pig iron were retrieved. Blast furnaces and the power station In 1980 - 1981, Katowice Steelworks was one of main centers of Solidarity. First strike began there on August 29, 1980, and on September 11, 1980, Katowice Agreement was signed in Katowice Steelworks, which was the fourth, final agreement between newly created free trade union and the Communist government (Gdańsk Agreement, Szczecin Agreement, Jastrzębie-Zdrój Agreement). Plant's Solidarity activists, headed by Andrzej Rozpłochowski, were very active, publishing several magazines, such as Free Trade-Unionist (Wolny Związkowiec), and Solidarity News (Wiadomości Solidarności) and organizing protests and industrial actions. In the night of August 14/15, 1981, “unknown individuals” destroyed Solidarity's publishing equipment in Katowice Steelworks. On December 12, 1981, a few hours before announcement of the Martial Law in Poland, Communist services arrested 36 Solidarity leaders of the plant, out of the list of 38. On December 13, 1981, at 5:40 in the morning, workers of both night and day shifts declared a strike and blocked all gates to the enterprise. On the next day, security forces stormed the plant, arresting 100 people. The strike nevertheless continued, and on December 16, some 6,200 workers participated in it. In the following days, military authorities amassed more than 4,000 officers and soldiers, together with helicopters and armoured carriers. They prepared an attack on the plant, but the workers, after a demonstration of force, finally gave up. The protest ended on December 23, at 1 p.m., with protesting workers leaving the plant and the police arresting hundreds. After collapse of the Communist system, Katowice Steelworks lost its Eastern markets and the plant had financial problems. In 1994, a large strike took place there, with workers demanding better salaries. In the following years, the situation did not improve and by 2000, bankruptcy of the plant was considered. In 2003, Katowice Steelworks joined Polskie Huty Stali S.A., and on January 14, 2005, it changed name to Mittal Steel Poland S.A., becoming part of Mittal Steel Company. In 1992, the plant employed 23,240, by 2006, the number of employees was reduced to 4,073. Among others, it manufactures rail and streetcar tracks, also it runs its own power station.

All the movements are from the overture to the opera Lucio Silla, K. 135, except for the minuet, K. 61h No. 3, which was composed separately. The symphony is scored for two oboes, two horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings. : \\\\relative c' { \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\tempo \\"Allegro\\" d2\\\\f d4 d  d r8 a d a d a  d4 r8 a fis' fis \\\\grace g16(fis8) e16 d  }  History and attribution  The symphony was discovered by Ernst Hintermaier in 1991. The parts he discovered were copied by Matthias Kracher, who was in close connection to Michael Haydn, but probably did not have a direct contact with the Mozart family. Hintermaier thought that Kracher did not expand the three- movement overture to Lucio Silla with a minuet, but instead copied all four movements from a set of parts or a full score of the complete four-movement symphony. The three overture movements in Kracher's copy are almost exactly identical with Mozart's autograph, but the minuet differs greatly from the copy of K. 61h by Johann Nepomuk Rainsprechter and an unknown copyist in Salzburg. Hintermaier also argued that the four-movement symphony is by Mozart, written some time after his return from Milan in March 1773, that this four-movement symphony was not cut down to three movements for the Lucio Silla overture, and that the four-movement symphony should be printed in a future NMA volume. The six minuets of K. 61h are doubtful. They were discovered by Friedrich Frischenschlager in some copies of Mozart's orchestral dances in the music archives of St. Peter in Salzburg in the early 20th century, and they were published in the 1923 Mozart Jahrbuch. This copy attributes the minuets to Wolfgang, and Frischenschlager accepted this attribution even though the dynamics were not in Mozart's style. He dated them between 1768 and 1772. Alfred Einstein dated the minuets to 1769 in Salzburg in his edition of the Köchel catalogue. Rudolf Elvers dated them instead to 1771-1772 in the NMA in 1961. The sixth edition of the Köchel catalogue repeated Einstein's dating of 1769. Wolfgang Plath placed doubts on K. 61h in the 1971/72 Mozart Jahrbuch, as some other minuets originally attributed to Mozart during this time were actually composed by Michael Haydn. He thought that K. 61h could be part of the 18 Minuets by Michael Haydn that Wolfgang told his sister he would make piano arrangements of. In the 1995 Mozart Jahrbuch, Andrea Lindmayr-Brandl stated that the authenticity for K. 61h was doubtful, but used Hintermaier's findings on the \\"Lucio Silla\\" symphony to say that Mozart's authorship was \\"at least probable\\", dating the set to ca. 1772. Rainsprechter was connected to Michael Haydn, and might have inserted a Michael Haydn minuet into the overture to make a symphony; since Mozart made copies of Michael Haydn's minuets, he could have believed it to be original Mozart. On the other hand, Rainsprechter had studied under Leopold Mozart, and may have obtained this symphony from him; if this is the case, this symphony is very likely to be authentic.MozartForum: KV.deest Mozart's Lucio Silla Symphony.

He belongs to All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul- Muslimeen party. Early Life Majid Hussain worked as an Executive with HSBC, migration and credit card division. After working for almost five years with the MNC, he left his cozy job and plunged into active politics. The 1980-born Hussain's schooling was at St Theresa's School, Humayun Nagar and Intermediate at Sultan Uloom College, Banjara Hills. After Inter, he enrolled for BCA at Anwar Uloom College, Mallepally. Majid hails from a family of Educationists. Both his father and mother are retired gazetted officers. His father MH Maqsood is a retired physical director and was Chairman of AP selection committee of handball, while his mother Qaisar Jahan a government teacher, retired as headmistress of the Government Girls High School, First Lancer. Majid's brother Mohd Shakir Hussain, who is a software professional, stays in the US. Political Career Majid Hussain was apparently hand-picked by the MIM President Asaduddin Owaisi because of his suave personality and affable manners. Majid fought the Municipal Elections first time on MIM ticker and won as the Corporator of Ahmednagar division in the 2009 GHMC Municipal elections. On January 4, 2012, Majid's candidature as GHMC Mayor was proposed by MIM’s Doodhbowli corporator MA Ghaffar and seconded by former mayor Banda Karthika Reddy. In a span of 15 minutes, the election process was completed and 31-year-old Majid Hussain was declared the new mayor of GHMC. After a gap of 21 years MIM’s has succeeded in installing its own mayor in the city of Hyderabad and in the process created a record of sorts. The party has chosen 31-year-old Mohammad Majid Hussain, the youngest mayor the city has ever had. On October 31, 2012, several developmental works worth Rs. 7 crore were inaugurated in Mayor Majid Hussain’s division of Ahmednagar by Hyderabad MP and Majlis chief Asaduddin Owaisi. The division boasted of a new community hall, a ladies training centre, a ration shop at Syednagar and a new bus stop. Feb 19, 2013, The lone corporator of Majlis Bachao Tehreek (MBT), Amjadullah Khan, was forcibly evicted from the council hall when he rushed to the mayor's podium protesting the denial of an opportunity to speak during the GHMC budget discussion. As Khan protested by standing at the podium, the mayor called marshals and got him evicted from the council hall. Majid Hussain had submitted his resignation on March 7, 2014 citing instructions from his party. The move was presented as honouring the agreement with Congress on seat- sharing but it was widely speculated that Mr. Hussain was being readied to contest from one of the Assembly constituencies in the city. Amid high drama, and apparently driven by political equations emerging ahead of the Assembly elections, the resignation of Mayor Majid Hussain was rejected by the GHMC’s General Council. Majid Hussain won as the Corporator of Mehdipatnam division in the 2016 GHMC Municipal elections. During Telangana Assembly elections held in December 2018, Majid Hussain was made the Election in-charge of Nampally Assembly constituency. MIM won Nampally seat comfortably under Majid Hussain. During 2019 General Elections, Majid Hussain was again made the election in-charge for Kishanganj seat.

Her father (1922–2001), a minister, is credited with teaching Aalfs about the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. By the age of sixteen, Aalfs had participated in assisting her mother in the founding of the women's center in New Bedford, Massachusetts, read and found inspiration in Sisterhood is Powerful, and had her poems published by the women's center at Southeastern Massachusetts University. During her first year at Hampshire College, in 1974, she joined the women's center and registered for women's studies classes at University of Massachusetts, which shared classes with Hampshire. While still in college, Aalfs came out of the closet as a lesbian. She would go on to get her Master's of Fine Arts degree from Sarah Lawrence College. Shortly thereafter she founded a women's writing group, and eventually two lesbian writing groups: Calypso Borealis and the Tuesday Night Lesbian Writers Group. She also founded Orogeny Press, a publishing house for fiction and lesbian poetry.

Anywhere has featured a revolving door of musicians, including Cedric Bixler- Zavala, Mike Watt, Krist Novoselic, Dale Crover and Jonathan Hischke. Biography First line-up Anywhere began as a Los Angeles/San Francisco collaborative project started by Christian Eric Beaulieu and Cedric Bixler-Zavala (of The Mars Volta/At the Drive-in). Fresh off years of writing and touring as co-founder of Bay Area acid punk extremists Triclops!, Beaulieu decided to immerse himself in the resonant universe of acoustic guitar and began performing solo under the moniker Liquid Indian. In early 2010 while in Los Angeles to perform at an art opening of mutual friend artist Sonny Kay, he befriended Bixler-Zavala who was a DJ for the event. The two exchanged numbers and planned to record something acoustic rooted in the open tuning, eastern raga style Beaulieu was delving into. Months later the pair met in Los Angeles, enlisted the mobile engineering talent of Toshi Kasai (Big Business) and tracked the new material in 2 days at The Melvins practice space in downtown Los Angeles. During that same visit Beaulieu played live on The Watt from Pedro Show as the musical guest of Mike Watt (of The Stooges, Firehose, Minutemen). After the show before leaving San Pedro, Beaulieu realized they needed bass for the recordings and boldly asked Watt if he'd contribute. Watt agreed immediately and a few months later delivered the entire projects bass tracks. Returning to San Francisco, Beaulieu decided to reach out to vocalist Rachel Fannan, who had recently parted ways with Bay Area psych rockers Sleepy Sun and had relocated to Los Angeles. Having never met Beaulieu before, Fannan generously contributed vocals to two of the songs, while Bixler-Zavala performed vocals on three tracks leaving the rest to exist as instrumentals. While searching for a label to release the album, Beaulieu solicited the talent of SF psychedelic poster artist Alan Forbes. During a meeting to discuss art concepts, Forbes revealed that he, along with his Secret Serpents business partner Justin Mcneal, had started a label called Valley King Records. They agreed to release a pair of singles as a series of limited edition silk-screened cover 7\\"s, all signed and hand numbered by Forbes. \\"Pyramid Mirrors\\" was released in November, 2011; the entire limited pressing of 500 sold out entirely on pre-order. The second 7\\", entitled \\"Infrared Moses\\", followed in March 2012. On March 20, 2012 it was announced that the self-titled debut full-length album by Anywhere will be released by All Tomorrow's Parties Recordings. It was first available exclusively as part of Record Store Day 2012 which took place on April 21 and was limited to 500 copies on 12\\" aqua coloured vinyl (with Download code). The regular CD, LP & digital releases followed on June 4 in the UK, available via ATP Recordings official site.http://www.atpfestival.com/recordings/release/anywhere/view.php Second line-up In 2013 a new, expanded line-up of Anywhere was formed, this time featuring Dale Crover (of Melvins and Altamont), Krist Novoselic (of Nirvana and Sweet 75), Jonathan Hischke (of Dot Hacker, Hella and EV Kain), Bret Constantino and Matt Holliman (of Sleepy Sun), Ethan Miller (of Comets on Fire and Feral Ohms) and Cyrus Comiskey (of Drunk Horse and Howlin Rain) alongside Beaulieu and Kasai. The first release by the new line-up was Olompali EP, released by Valley King Records on a limited edition 12\\" picture disk with the art by Alan Forbes. Third line-up On August 26, 2014, Valley King Records announced a third line-up, including Cedric Bixler-Zavala, Mike Watt, Christian Beaulieu, Jonathan Hischke, Bret Constantino, Greg Rogove and others, with work on a new release being in pre-production stage.

Government reports give a total of 24 killed and 54 injured, while survivors report over 100 killed. Background On 10 September 1984, Sergeant Hermanu, a member of the Community Advisory Non-Commissioned Officer () arrived at As Saadah Mosque in Tanjung Priok, North Jakarta, and told the caretaker, Amir Biki, to remove brochures and banners critical of the government. Biki refused, so Hermanu removed them himself; to do so, he reportedly entered the prayer area of the mosque without removing his shoes (a serious violation of mosque etiquette). In response, local residents, led by mosque caretakers Syarifuddin Rambe and Sofwan Sulaeman, burned his motorcycle and attacked Hermanu while he was talking with another officer. The two then arrested Rambe and Sulaeman, as well as another caretaker, Achmad Sahi, and an unemployed man named Muhamad Noor. Incident Two days after the arrest, Islamic cleric Abdul Qodir Jaelani gave a sermon against Pancasila at As Saadah mosque. Afterwards, Biki led a protest to the District Military Command office for North Jakarta, where the four prisoners were being held. Along the way, the group's numbers swelled, with estimates ranging between 1,500 and several thousand. Also during the trip, nine members of a Muslim Chinese Indonesian family headed by Tan Kioe Liem were killed by the protestors. The family's store, a pharmacy, was burned to the ground. Once at the military command, the group unsuccessfully demanded the release of the prisoners. At roughly 11 p.m. local time (UTC+7), the protestors surrounded the military command. Military personnel from the 6th Air Defence Artillery Battalion opened fire on the protestors. Around midnight, eyewitnesses saw Jakarta Military chief Try Sutrisno and Armed Forces commander Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani supervising the removal of the victims; the corpses were loaded into military trucks and buried in unmarked graves, while the wounded were sent to Gatot Soebroto Military Hospital. Aftermath The military reported that the riots had been triggered by a man in a fake military uniform who distributed anti-government pamphlets along with 12 other accomplices; it reported having the man in custody. General Hartono Rekso Dharsono was arrested for allegedly inciting the riots. After a four-month trial, he was convicted; he was eventually released in September 1990, after serving five years in jail. After the riots, at least 169 civilians were allegedly held without warrant. Some were reportedly tortured. The leaders were arrested and tried for subversion, then given long sentences when convicted. Others, including as Amir Biki, were among those killed. Initial reports suggested 20 dead. Current official records give a total of 24 killed and 54 injured (including the military), while survivors report over a hundred killed. Tanjung Priok residents estimate a total of 400 killed or missing, while other reports suggest up to 700 victims. Investigation With the influx of human rights movements after the fall of Suharto in 1998, several groups were created to advocate for the rights of the victims, including the 1984 Foundation, the National Solidarity for the 1984 Tanjung Priok Incident (), and the Extended Family for Victims of the Tanjung Priok Incident (; founded by Biki's widow Dewi Wardah and son Beni). These groups pushed for the People's Representative Council (DPR) and National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) to further investigate the massacre; inside the DPR, representatives A.W. Fatwa and Abdul Qodir Jaelani, both previously arrested after the massacre, pressed for further investigation. In 1999, Komnas HAM agreed to investigate the incident, forming the Commission for the Investigation and Examination of Human Rights Violations in Tanjung Priok (KP3T). The KP3T consisted mainly of political figures from the previous regime, including former prosecutor general Djoko Sugianto. The resulting report, released in early June 2000, found that there had been no systematic massacre in the incident. This was not well received by the general public. On 23 June 2000, approximately 300 members of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) attacked the headquarters of Komnas HAM while dressed in white Islamic clothing and green scarves. They broke windows with stones and rattan sticks, outnumbering and overwhelming the security forces. The FPI was upset at the commission's report on the massacre and perceived collusion with the military, arguing that it had ignored actions by the military; it insisted that the commission be abolished. Meanwhile, Minister of Law and Human Rights Yusril Ihza Mahendra wrote that Komnas HAM had seemingly applied double standards when investigating the issue; he said that they seemed more reluctant to investigate the Tanjung Priok incident than they had been in investigating the 1999 East Timorese crisis. Crescent Star Party leader Ahmad Sumargono called the verdict a disappointment to Muslims everywhere. In October 2000, Komnas HAM released another report indicating that 23 individuals, including Sutrisno and Moerdani, should be investigated for their involvement; it called for an ad hoc tribunal to look into the matter further. With President Abdurrahman Wahid calling for further investigation and the impending tribunal, several military officials made contracts of forgiveness (islah) with victims' families; although the islah did not contain admissions of guilt, it did provide for victims to receive a lump sum of Rp. 1.5-2 million (US$200–250). The first islah covered 86 families, as represented by Rambe, while the second covered Biki's family; by 1 March 2001 a number of islah had been made. As a result of the islah, several victims or their families, suggested to investigator M.A. Rachman that charges be dropped. However, the investigation continued, wrapping up in July 2003. Under international pressure, in 2003 the DPR approved the use of the 2000 human rights law to bring perpetrators of the massacre to trial for crimes against humanity; the trial began in September of that year. Those brought to trial included Colonel Sutrisno Mascung, leader of Platoon II of the Air Defense Artillery Battalion at the time, and 13 subordinates. Higher-ranking officials from the time, including Try Sutrisno and Benny Moerdani, were exempted from prosecution, as were former President Suharto and former Justice Minister Ismail Saleh. The prosecution was led by Widodo Supriyadi, and Deputy Speaker of the DPR A.M. Fatwa served as a witness for the prosecution. Several officers prosecuted were convicted, while Sriyanto and Pranowo were acquitted. In 2004, the Attorney General's Office unsuccessfully appealed the acquittals of Sriyanto and Pranowo. The convictions were later overturned by the Supreme Court of Indonesia. The trial was criticized by human rights groups and activisits; German author Fabian Junge argued that \\"prosecutors deliberately ignored substantial evidence while scare-tactics and bribery were rampant outside court\\". Approaching the 25th anniversary of the massacre, the victims, aided by the Human Rights Working Group and the Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence, sent a letter to UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, Gabriela Carina Knaul de Albuquerque e Silva, imploring her to intervene in the case. The survivors also requested compensation of Rp1.015 billion (US$130,000) from the government for their \\"pain and loss\\". Although victims and their representatives asked President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to further investigate the issue, the case has not come to closure.

After the death of the 48th Da'i al-Mutlaq Abdul Husain Husamuddin the helm of the Dawoodi Bohra sect came into his hands. He led the community out of a period of indebtedness, disorganization and lack of development within the sect. Being the son of the 47th Da'i al-Mutlaq he had always been closely associated with the members of the Dawoodi Bohra sect. For the whole part of his childhood and adolesence until age 40, he served his father. He was educated by his father in all aspects of religion and the world.Hozefa Mohiyuddin, Tuhfatuh ale Akhbaare Hudat, Al Jamea tus Saifiyah, 1995, pg. 91 He married Aaisaheba Amatulla Aaisaheba and settled in Surat. After the death of his father, he served Abdul Husain Husamuddin with the same respect and dedication that he had for his father. After he became the 49th Da'i al-Mutlaq he devised a time bound planHozefa Mohiyuddin, Tuhfatuh ale Akhbaare Hudat, Al Jamea tus Saifiyah, 1995, pg. 92 to bring about a total turnaround in the prospects of the members of the Dawoodi Bohra community. In the first five years he concentrated on paying off the debts of the community. In this effort Abdullah Badruddin lent complete support which resulted in all the debts getting paid off in five years. The next five years he devoted to restructuring the organisational setup and rearranging the work procedures of the community. The following five years after that, he worked towards development and growth of the members of the community in particular and the sect as a whole. He remained as the Da'i al-Mutlaq until 1906. He appointed, or did nass, upon his nephew Abdullah Badruddin as his successor and died chanting \\"Ya Ali, Ya Ali\\" continuously in his last moments. Early life Mohammed Burhanuddin was born to Abdul Qadir Najmuddin in Surat, a city in the state of Gujarat, India, where his father stayed. He spend his childhood being raised in the family of Da'i al-Mutlaq and educated by his father. His father was a very brave and intelligent leader who steered the community through testing times, when the enemies of the Dawoodi Bohra community hatched an conspiracy among the members of the community stating that nas (the process of appointing a successor) has not been done over his father by the 46th Da'i al- Mutlaq Mohammed Badruddin.Hozefa Mohiyuddin, Tuhfatuh ale Akhbaare Hudat, Al Jamea tus Saifiyah, 1995, pg. 68 This created great chaos and confusion within the community. His father remained quiet and did not answer his enemies but concentrated on imparting education to the members of the Dawoodi Bohra such that they remain unaffected by those rumors. When asked the reason of not answering the enemies his father said that the fifth Da'i al-Mutlaq from him will answer his enemies. He married Aaisaheba Amatulla Aaisaheba and settled in Surat. His son Taher Saifuddin, was said by Abdul Qadir Najmuddin to be the one who would answer his enemies. He spend most of his time being with his father and helping his father in performing the religious duties. This was also a time for learning the intercacies of the beliefs, customs and traditions of the Dawoodi Bohra sect from his father. While he was with his father, Aaisaheba Amatulla Aaisaheba always took great care of his children. But just eight years after the birth of Taher Saifuddin, Aaisaheba Amatulla Aaisaheba died, which was a great loss for him. Life Before Da'i al-Mutlaq Mohammed Burhanuddin was born in the same year his father became 47th Da'i al- Mutlaq of the Dawoodi Bohra community. He served his father and also served his uncle the 48th Da'i al-Mutlaq Abdul Husain Husamuddin. So Mohammed Burhanuddin had the honor of serving two Da'i al-Mutlaq. At the age of 15 Mohammed Burhanuddin was conferred Hadiyat (a title for learned) and the laqab (name to be used after the first name) of Burhanuddin by his father. His father also prepared Mohammed Burhanuddin to take up the responsibilities of a Da'i al-Mutlaq and appointed him as the raas ul hudood (a position of esteem in Dawoodi Bohra sect). After the demise of his father he served his uncle the 48th Da'i al-Mutlaq Abdul Husain Husamuddin with the same zeal and dedication as he served his father. His uncle appointed him as Mukasir e Dawat (The third highest position in Dawoodi Bohra sect). He was also the Wali of Mumbai. When he visited Karbala for the ziyarat of Imam Husain accompanied by Aaisaheba Amatulla Aaisaheba, he asked her to stand very close to the Zarih Mubarak of Imam Husain so that the child in her womb can get the blessings of Imam Husain. At that time that child in her womb was Taher Saifuddin. In the year 1891 AD his uncle 48th Da'i al-Mutlaq decided to go to Mumbai. At the time of his departure he said, \\"I am leaving my mansoos (appointed successor by nass) and jaan nasheen Mohammed Burhanuddin behind me.\\" In this way his uncle did nass upon him. His uncle became ill during the journey. When his uncle reached Ahmedabad, the ailment became very serious so his uncle again performed nass upon him before important post holders of the Dawoodi Bohra community and took a pledge (misaq) from them to uphold the nass and died. And Mohammed Burhanuddin became the 49th Da'i al-Mutlaq of the Dawoodi Bohra sect. At that time he was in Mumbai but was not able to go to Ahmedabad due to heavy rains. Even the skies were morning the demise of Abdul Husain Husamuddin. Life As Da'i al-Mutlaq Mohammed Burhanuddin became the 49th Da'i al-Mutlaq in the year 1891. At that time there were huge debts on the Dawoodi Bohra community. He continued the efforts of the 48th Da'i al-Mutlaq Abdul Husain Husamuddin to pay off the debts of the community. Abdullah Badruddin helped him extensively in this effort. The first five years of his era was marked with great hardship. But in five years he managed to settle all the debts of the community. In the next five years he regularised and organised the functing of the Dawoodi Bohra sect. For the next five years he ensured that the community becomes secured and that the name of the community is held high in esteem before the world. He has built many masjids (Places to perform prayers), madresas (schools to give knowledge about religion) and musafirkhana (places of stay for travellers). He also instituted the custom of providing meals to the travellers who come to pay their respects at the tombs of the deceased leaders and eminent persons of the Dawoodi Bohra sect. Whenever he visited Mumbai, he stayed in Saifee Mahal. He even performed a waaz (sermon) of Ashura (the tenth day of the first month, Moharam ul Haram, of the Hijri calendar) at Saifee Mahal. This place was later purchased by his son 51st Da'i al-Mutlaq Taher Saifuddin] who made it the House of the Da'i al- Mutlaq.http://wikimapia.org/7261856/Saifee-Mahal, many authors, 'Saifee Mahal (Mumbai)', wikimapia.org, reverted 10 March 2014 In the year 1904 he, at the age of 64, went to perform Haj. When he arrived in Kaaba, the King of Hijaz welcomed him with great respect and dignity. A ceremonial procession with him seated on a horse-drawn cart, was taken out on the streets of the markets of Mina. All the people were amazed by the radiance emanating from him. The local people showed their respects towards him by kissing his hands and feet. Not knowing who he was the people were so awestruck by his glory that they regarded him to be an angel. The year 1906 was marked with sadness for the members of the Dawoodi Bohra community as in this year the vallant and far sighted leader of the Dawoodi Bohra sect, Mohammed Burhanuddin became ill. The members of the community prayed for his recovery. But destiny had sorrow written for in 1906. His ailment became very serious. Such that he conferred nass upon Abdullah Badruddin and died. He remained as Da'i al-Mutlaq for a period of 15 years during which he led the Dawoodi Bohra community out of indebtedness to a position self-reliance and growth where each and every member of the Dawoodi Bohra community is happy and prospering. Achievements When Mohammed Burhanuddin became the 49th Da'i al-Mutlaq, the Dawoodi Bohra sect was greatly indebted, unorganized and there was lack of development. Burhanuddin charted out a plan to change the position of the Dawoodi Bohra sect which was as follows: *For the first five years he devoted all his time and efforts to pay off the debts of the sect. He approached the affluent and the prominent members of the community personally to raise the amount to pay off the debts. Such that all the debts were paid off during or by the end of five years. *For the next five years he concentrated on restructuring the organisational hierarchy of the Dawoodi Bohra community such that control and responsibility were established. This allowed the smooth functioning of the different departments and solved all the hurdles they had faced earlier. At the end of five years all the organisations of the Dawoodi Bohra community had become very efficient and began functioning effectively, managing the affairs of the community in an orderly manner. *The next five years he put in all his efforts towards the development of the community. He worked out ways and means to bring about growth and prosperity in the community. It is because of his efforts that within a period of five years had the Dawoodi Bohra community reached great heights as regards growth and standard of living. ::He has built a number of masjids, so as to facilitate the members of the community to perform their prayers and other tenents of the religion. He set up many madresas so as to facilitate learning of the religious teachings such that the current generation and the new generations would have a correct and same picture of the religion, its tenents, its beliefs and its culture. ::He made many musafirkhanas mostly near the places of the tombs of various Da'i al-Mutlaq and eminent members of Dawoodi Bohra sect so as to facilitate people from far away places to visit these tombs and pay their respects. He further went ahead and started the custom of making free food arrangements available for the visitors of the musafirkhanas. Such that people of the community members can come and stay at these musafirkhanas, pay their respects to the tombs present there without any worry about their food requirements. All these brought great posperity and growth in the community such that during the last moments of his life he was very satisfied with his efforts and chanted the name of Maulana Ali, whose famous last words were \\"I swear by the God of Khaba, I have won\\". Mohammed Burhanuddin too had won in his life.

Background  The Riber Award had its official beginning in 2002 but dates back to the time when film production became a part of the education program at Humanistic Informatics. The idea for a short film festival came from the tutor corps at Humanistic Informatics, who wanted to pay tribute to the unconventional and creative examination form. This tribute began at a very low practical level for example in connection with the annual Christmas party. But all this changed in 2002 when a group of students at Humanistic Informatics devised the idea of upgraded this tribute to a short film festival. The first couple of years the short film festival took place at the concert hall at the student house in Aalborg. The Riber Award quickly created so much media attention that Aalborg University began supporting the project in the hope that it could continue for many years to come. As the short film festival grow bigger and bigger it also became necessary to find larger and larger locations where it was possible to hold the event.

Early life and education Joann Aalfs was born in 1923 in St. Paul, Minnesota to Cecelia Elizabeth Nesler and James Humphrey Wilkinson. She attended the Summit School in St. Paul, graduating in 1941, and earned her undergraduate degree at Bennington College in 1945. She attended Union Theological Seminary in New York.  Career  Aalfs served alongside her then husband in various Presbyterian ministries, in areas such as Salem, New York and Kasur, Pakistan in 1951–1952. Aalfs began, in 1963, organizing political rallies and social events with women in New Bedford, Massachusetts. She would to work with the New Bedford Women's Center in 1972, Women and Violence from 1976 to 1977, and the Southeastern Massachusetts University Women's Center from 1972 to 1978. In time, the New Bedford Women's Center's focus on activism for women's health, access to abortions, etc., left her unsatisfied. She wanted to be part of a women's community that focused more on consciousness- raising as a tool toward personal and cultural change. Ultimately Aalfs left the NBWC to help found the New Bedford Women's Awareness Group, which met more or less surreptitiously for several years in the 1970s and early 80s in the local YWCA. The group created Rough Draft, a newsletter that told stories of the women within the organization. Personal life In 1950, Aalfs married John Linden Aalfs, with whom she had four children: Mary Linden (1951), Mark Stephen (1953), Janet Elizabeth (1956), and Thomas John (1958). Aalfs' daughter Janet is a poet and martial artist. in 1980, Aalfs escaped what had been an abusive marriage (with the help of Boston College professor, Mary Daly, some of whose classes she had attended) and divorced her husband.

Roveland, University of Massachusetts Amherst, commenting on self-taught archaeologists who played a major role from 1930 and onwards in archaeological discoveries in northern Germany, specifically cited Rust as \\"the most effective of these amateurs, whose work on the now classic sites of Meiendorf and Stellmoor launched the study of the Hamburgian period.\\"Blythe E Roveland, \\"Contextualizing the history and practice of Paleolithic archaeology: Hamburgian research in northern Germany\\" (January 1, 2000). Electronic Doctoral Dissertations for UMass Amherst. Paper AAI9978546. http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations/AAI9978546 Youth The swampy landscape around Hamburg has hardly changed since the days when Rust was a child (other than the graffiti on the little bridge over the Dove, an arm of the Elbe, and the antenna in the background ...). Coming from a very modest family, raised by his single mother, Alfred Rust loved observing nature in the moors and marshes surrounding the city of Hamburg as a child. As a young man he trained as an electrical worker, but enrolled in night classes at the Institute of Archaeology of Hamburg (Volkshochschule zur Archäologie). He was hard working and passionate about prehistory, drawing the attention and kindness of his teachers.  Journey to the Middle East  To better understand the origin of Paleolithic stone tools in Central Europe, (and no doubt attracted by the discovery in 1928 by Dorothy Garrod of the Natufian culture in Wadi en-Natuf in the current West Bank) Rust began a bike trip to the Middle East in 1930 with a friend. Leaving from Hamburg on 1 September, they crossed the Balkans, Turkey, Syria, Palestine, and finally succeeded at the cost many adventures and sufferings to Alexandria in Egypt. Exhausted and suffering from disease, Rust was hospitalized at the Danish hospital in Nebek, north of Damascus. During his convalescence, and for several months, he explored and excavated the caves carved into the cliffs of the wadi (valley) of Skifta, near the small town of Yabrud. He discovered, with the help of his friend and some local laborers, one of the most important Palaeolithic sites in the Middle East. The adventurous story of this discovery and the results of his excavations at Yabrud were published by Rust between the years 1931 and 1933 in Offa, the journal of Archaeology led by Gustav Schwantes (Rust's mentor) and Herbert Jankuhn. Maturity The lush meadows of Meiendorf (Schleswig-Holstein), where Rust began digging in 1930. Note the channels draining the water into a sump, and wetland vegetation. After his return to Germany, Rust worked for an electricity company and pursued his vocation as an amateur archaeologist. He was encouraged by the pre-historian Gustav Schwantes, who was also self-taught in his youth. With hard work and the spirit of innovation, Rust used new methods (soil coring, excavation in floodplains with drainage by pumps) to examine the layers of peat around the areas left by the melting of the ice sheet which currently form the Meiendorfer Ahrensburg valley, near Hamburg (in the district of Stormarn, State of Schleswig-Holstein). In the 1930s, Rust discovered the remains of Paleolithic settlements (tents, homes, carving reliefs etc. ...) in particular Meiendorf, the type site of the Hamburg culture. Kerbspitze (= \\"notched edge\\" in German) of flint with tang, typical of the Hamburgian culture Rust showed (which was denied at the time) that groups of hunter-gatherers frequented the tundra stretching to the foot of the huge glaciers that covered northern Europe during the Ice Age. He found numerous flint tools (awls, scrapers, chisels for working bone and antler, pairs of blades for mounting on a pair of scissors) and carved stone, wood or bone weapons (spears). He also discovered the bones of sacrificed animals, especially deer, found intact except for a large stone which was placed intentionally in the thorax of each animal. Among his other notable discoveries: an amber plate with a hole and engraved figures (horse, bird, fish), a finely carved and incised stick, and a baton decorated with a large pair of reindeer antlers. Rust, through his discoveries in the field excavations at Meiendorf, showed that reindeer hunters belonging to the Hamburg culture in the late Paleolithic were hunting in this region about 15000 years ago. During a period of warmer climate, about 13400 years ago, hunters belonging to the Magdalenian culture also lived at the foot of glaciers until a new cold period, 12,700 years ago, after which appeared the reindeer hunting Ahrensburg culture. tang at the base and the stem that allows a solid attachment to the shaft. In Stellmoor (\\"marshy place\\" in German), a site representative of the Ahrensburg culture, by studying the weapons and their traces on the bones of game (perforations of the scapula in particular) Rust brought to light that the weapons and mode of hunting had evolved from the spear with a large blade to the smaller arrows made of pine with sharp points.See \\"paleosite.free.fr/arc/origines/stellmoor.htm\\", that publishes excerpts (text and illustrations) from the book by Jürgen Junkmanns \\"Bow and arrows: manufacture and use in the Neolithic\\" (editions Schwaab, Bienne) Rust deduced that these different types of weapons matched a different hunting technique (as well as a social organization and lithic size): the spear was powerful but imprecise (used in killing large herds of reindeer driven by many beaters) and gave way to bow and arrows used in stalking, probably oriented thin by over-hunting and climate change. At the time of National Socialism Rust was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Kiel on 1 June 1940. In the words of B.E. Roveland \\"Researchers [German archaeologists at sites in northern Germany] were followed with passion by a fascinated public, and in the socio-political and economic context of inter-war Germany, they caused a powerful movement of regional and national pride.\\" Rust had to yield to the entreaties of Wolfram Sievers (Director of the SS Ahnenerbe) and he joined the \\"Institute of ancestral heritage,\\" which allowed him to escape conscription. After World War II Rust was a member of the research department for prehistory (Landesamt für Vor-und Frühgeschichte) and worked on other tools of the Paleolithic. He also worked with the archaeologist Gustav Steffens in a series of excavations conducted on the \\"Stufe\\" (degree, escarpment) of Altona, near Wittenberg,Die Artefact der Altonaer Stufe von Wittenberg. Eine mittelpleistozäne Untergruppe der Heidelberger Kulturen (K.Walcholtz Verlag, 1962) and made important work on othercultures (\\"dating the Clactonian by the typology of tools, and Treene through geological stratigraphy\\").See the website http://originsnet.org/hambwitt1gallery/index.htm Many of Rust's scientific findings were opposed from the year 1950according to Marc Groenen, in his book Pour une histoire de la Préhistoire : le Paléolithique, 1994, éditions Jérôme Million and scientific terminology that Rust had developed and he published in 1950 was abandoned in favor of the one established by a British archaeologist, Miss Dorothy Garrod.: ainsi la terminologie scientifique que Rust avait élaborée et qu'il publia en 1950.Die Höhlenfunde von Jabrud (Syrien) (K.Wacholtz Verlag, 1950) She continued his prospecting in the Holy Land where she had individualized Natufian culture in 1928, had excavated a site (the Mugharet el Emireh) in Lower Galilée.Notes sur le Paléolithique supérieur au Moyen-Orient by D.

Sonneville-Bordes also searched the site at Yabrud in the years 1954-55. However in the 1990s, the originality of the work of Rust in Syria was recognized, especially his discovery of \\"previously unknown lithic industries, such as the Yabrudian and pre-Aurignacian.cf.

Muhesen http://www.persée.fr/web/revues/prescription/article/syria_0039-7946-1992 And in the same year 1990, an excavation mission from Columbia University also made excavations at the site of Yabrud and its conclusions did justice to the vision of Rust, especially in the individualization of 45 layers of different cultures that had occupied it.according to the film documentary Das Geheimnis der Eiszeitjäger (cf. see paragraph Sources) For its participation in the Ahnenerbe, Rust suffered criticism in his later years.

The rostrum is edged with pointy teeth that are used for both hunting and defense. This species is noted for its general elongated and slender form and a rostrum roughly 1/3 of its total length. This shark was named by researchers at the Pacific Shark Research Center at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, the west coast representative of the National Shark Research Consortium. It was named after Nancy Packard of the Packard family, who has donated generously to organizations researching the oceans. Distribution and habitat The African dwarf sawshark has primarily been found off the coast of Mozambique. Possible records of this species off the coasts of Somalia and Kenya remain unconfirmed. This sawshark lives a benthic lifestyle on the continental shelf, at depths reaching . Behavior Very little is known about the biology of the African dwarf sawshark. It would appear, based on the stomach samples taken in the field, that these sharks favor benthic invertebrates like small crustaceans. Nothing is known about the reproductive habits of this sawshark, though it is safe to assume that like other members of Pristiophoriformes it is ovoviviparous. Conservation As the African dwarf sawshark was only recently discovered in 2011, the IUCN Red List has yet to evaluate the conservation status of this animal. Though it is not known to be utilized for food, this shark is at great risk of being caught as bycatch in shrimping and bottom trawling operations. Considering its habitat, rarity, and behavior, the African dwarf sawshark poses no threat to humans.

Its name is derived from the river Oos, which runs through Baden-Baden.  History  St. Dionysius Church, built in 1864 to replace its medieval predecessor Baden-Baden Station airship hangar in Oos BABO, a former office building of the French occupying forces The shopping mall \\"Shopping Cité\\" The village of Oos has always been important for the town of Baden-Baden, even before it was officially incorporated. Documents dating back to 1245, for instance, state that taxes collected from Oos were to be paid to the Lichtenthal Abbey, which was newly founded by Countess Irmengard of Baden. The settlement itself is considerably older. This is evidenced, for instance, by a Roman votive stone dedicated to Diana, goddess of the hunt, which was found in Oos in 1794. The Romans under Emperor Trajan had realized the strategic value of the place, a plain at the edge of the Black Forest, and built the military road leading northward from Basel through Oos. During the Middle Ages, the settlement was ruled at times by the Lichtenthal Abbey or the current Count of Baden. Its strategic value was proven once again in 1634, when the Catholic Margrave Wilhelm of Baden-Baden defeated his Protestant cousin and the Swedish occupying forces in battle on the \\"Ooser Blutfeld\\" (\\"blood plains of Oos\\"), thus ending foreign rule over his domain during the Thirty Years' War. In the early 19th century, the village of Oos, which consisted of around 100 houses at the time, received its own official borders, followed by a train station in 1844. From this station, passengers were transported to Baden-Baden via horsebus, until a railway was built the following year. The route was used until 1977, when the Oos train station became the new Baden-Baden station. In 1910, Oos was brought into the spotlight when Germany's first passenger airship hangar was opened on the new local airfield. The hangar and its assets were auctioned off for 295.000 Deutsche Mark following theTreaty of Versailles; some parts are still used in an industrial sawmill in Auggen today.flugplatz-baden-oos.de: Geschichte ab 1910, Zugriff am 15.

Bell and the sociologists Martin S. Weinberg and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith, in which the authors reevaluate what were at the time of its publication widely held ideas about the origins of heterosexuality and homosexuality, sometimes rejecting entirely the factors proposed as causes, and in other cases concluding that their importance had been exaggerated. Produced with the help of the American National Institute of Mental Health, the study was a publication of the Institute for Sex Research. Together with its Statistical Appendix, Sexual Preference was the conclusion of a series of books including Homosexuality: An Annotated Bibliography (1972) and Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women (1978), both co-authored by Bell and Weinberg. Using data derived from interviews conducted in 1969 and 1970 with subjects in the San Francisco Bay Area, Bell et al. attempted to test explanations of sexual orientation put forward by psychoanalysts and social scientists. They found that while homosexual men were more likely than heterosexual men to have felt especially close to their mothers, this had almost no effect on the development of male homosexuality. Poor father-son relationships appeared to be weakly connected to male homosexuality. Homosexual women were more likely than heterosexual women to describe their relationships with their mothers as negative, and to have detached or hostile fathers, but only the latter factor seemed significant. In both sexes, but especially in men, homosexuality was connected to \\"Childhood Gender Nonconformity\\", which was a measure partly of behavior more typical of the opposite sex and partly of subjective feelings of masculinity and femininity. Sexual abuse and labeling by others played no significant role. Bell et al. concluded that psychoanalytic explanations of sexual orientation are inadequate. They suggested that while bisexuality may be subject to influence by social and sexual learning, the development of heterosexuality and homosexuality may have a biological basis, possibly influenced by hormonal factors. They hoped that demonstrating a biological basis to homosexuality would have beneficial effects such as increasing tolerance of gay people. Seen as likely to provoke controversy even before its publication, Sexual Preference received considerable media attention, and mixed reviews. Critics questioned Bell et al.′s reliance upon a statistical technique, originally developed for use in the biological sciences, called path analysis, disputed the representativeness of their sample of homosexuals, pointed out the difficulty and potential unreliability of adult recall of childhood feeling and the vague and general nature of the questions respondents were asked, and disagreed with Bell et al.′s suggestion that sexual orientation is innate. Nevertheless, some reviewers complimented Sexual Preference for its authors' challenge to established views about the causes of homosexuality, and it eventually came to be considered a classic work. It is one of the most frequently cited retrospective studies relating to sexual orientation, credited by psychologists with disproving psychoanalytic theories about the development of homosexuality. It was the last study on homosexuality released by the Institute for Sex Research. Summary Overview of the study Bell et al.′s objective was to test the explanations of how people become heterosexual or homosexual proposed by psychoanalysts and social scientists, including psychoanalytic theories attributing homosexuality to a failure to resolve Oedipal conflicts. In their view, theories about the origins of sexual orientation had usually not been rigorously tested prior to their study, partly because some of them, including those advanced by psychoanalysts, use concepts which are hard to \\"pin down and operationalize.\\" They anticipated that psychologists and psychoanalysts would object to their work on methodological grounds, such as that no attempt was made to access unconscious material, or that the interviews, which lasted only a few hours, could never reveal what truly occurred in someone's childhood. They argued, however, that the fact that their data was not obtained from clinical sources was a strength, that attempting to access unconscious material risks selective interpretation of the data, and that \\"if the differences between homosexual and heterosexual patterns of development are really as great as psychoanalytic theory claims\\" then such differences would be reflected to at least some extent in the reports of their respondents. Aware that some scholars might reject any view of the development of homosexuality resembling psychoanalytic theory, they noted that many of the variables used in their statistical analyses pertained to \\"experiences occurring outside our respondents′ original households\\", including relationships with peers, labeling by others, and sexual experiences. They added that it was not easy to answer objections to the use of retrospective data, given the unresolved issue of how accurate their respondents′ recollections of childhood were, and that even a longitudinal study would have been open to question. They observed that some gay rights activists might object to their study on principle, and suspect that they wanted to find a way to prevent homosexuality. However, they argued that ideas about the development of homosexuality contribute to prejudice against homosexuals, and that so long as heterosexuals accepted largely untested theories that see homosexuality as the result of a bad upbringing, their negative attitudes toward homosexuals would never change. They considered their sample of homosexual adults more representative than those used in previous studies, and argued that examining blacks separately from whites, and men separately from women, helped them to determine the extent to which patterns of homosexual and heterosexual development depend on race and sex. They wrote that while Bell, a psychologist and therapist, was \\"relatively supportive of psychodynamic theory\\", Weinberg and Hammersmith were sociologists with a different outlook. They argued that their varying outlooks helped counteract bias. They did not believe that completing their study earlier would have altered their findings. Believing that familiarity with scientific theories about homosexuality might bias their respondents′ answers, they did not report results that could be explained through exposure to them. They used path analysis, a statistical technique originally developed for use in the biological sciences, to try to establish which factors were most important. It required dividing \\"the independent variables into sequential stages, according to the time when their influences are most likely to occur.\\" The dependent variable they wanted to explain, adult sexual preference, went at the final stage. Findings on white men Bell et al. found that homosexual men were more likely than heterosexual men to have felt especially close to their mothers. Male respondents who were unusually close to their mothers were more likely to describe themselves as having been feminine children, but only a minority of boys with this kind of background became homosexual. Bell et al. concluded that male homosexuality is not the \\"result of an unusually strong maternal identification\\", and that mothers have only a small influence on their sons′ psychosexual development. Homosexual men were less likely to give positive descriptions of their fathers, but more likely to have negative feelings toward their fathers, to dislike, hate, or fail to feel close to them, or to consider them hostile or detached. They were also more likely to feel more similar to their mothers than to their fathers, or to prefer to be like their mothers. Bell et al. concluded that, \\"Unfavorable relationships with fathers\\" have a weak connection to \\"gender nonconformity and early homosexual experiences\\". Few male respondents had engaged in childhood sex play, and it did not seem to be important in the development of homosexuality. Homosexual men were less likely to report having enjoyed boys' activities such as football and to see themselves as having been very masculine while growing up, but more likely to report having enjoyed stereotypical girls' activities. Three variables (dislike of typical boys' activities, enjoying typical girls' activities, and feelings of masculinity or femininity) were combined into a composite measure called \\"Childhood Gender Nonconformity\\", which proved to be the most important developmental variable. It appeared to make male respondents less likely to feel attraction to the opposite sex during childhood, but more likely to feel sexually different from other boys, experience homosexual arousal and activities, and become homosexual as adults. Homosexual men were more likely to recall having felt different from other boys their age, or to say that they felt different because they did not like sport, or because they were not interested in girls or were sexually interested in other boys. They were also more likely to report feeling different because they had stereotypical feminine traits or interests. Feeling different during childhood appeared to be irrelevant, but feeling different for gender reasons during adolescence had \\"modest total effects\\". Boys who felt sexually different were more likely to become homosexual as adults, whether they began to feel that way during childhood or adolescence. While homosexual men were more likely to have been labeled sexually different or homosexual before the age of 19, this apparently played no significant role in the development of sexual orientation. Homosexual men tended to have had their first homosexual encounter at a younger age, and were more likely to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data did not support the idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate predictor of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, did not seem to be important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not seem to be an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult sexual preference. Findings on white women Homosexual women were more likely to describe their relationships with their mothers as negative, and their mothers as having been hostile or rejecting. These measures were combined into a single measure, \\"Hostile-Rejecting Mother\\", which appeared to have only minimal influence on the development of sexual preference. Homosexual women were less likely to describe their mothers as having been pleasant people. This and two other connected variables were combined into a composite measure called \\"Unpleasant Mother\\", which had a weak and indirect connection with adult homosexuality. Homosexual women identified less strongly with their mothers, though this appeared to have very little influence on adult sexual preference, having only indirect effects, dependent upon its encouragement of childhood gender nonconformity. Homosexual women gave less favorable descriptions of their relationships with their fathers, and were more likely to have negative feelings toward them, and to describe them as having been hostile or detached. These variables were combined into a measure called \\"Detached-Hostile Father\\", which appeared to encourage childhood gender nonconformity and adolescent homosexual involvement. Homosexual women were less likely to identify with their fathers, but the \\"Identification with Father\\" variable appeared to be unimportant. Few female respondents reported engaging in sex play with their siblings, and it seemed to have no role in the development of sexual preference. Homosexual women were less likely to report having enjoyed typical girls' activities, but more likely to report having enjoyed typical boys' activities, such as football, and to describe themselves as having been very masculine while they were growing up. These and other variables were combined into a \\"Childhood Gender Nonconformity\\" measure, which proved to be the second strongest predictor of homosexuality. Bell et al. noted, however, that childhood gender nonconformity did not seem to have been important in the way proposed by psychoanalytic theory, in that it was not a crucial link between family influences and their respondents' sense of womanhood, and nor was it explained by relationships within the family. Homosexual women were more likely to recall having felt different from other girls their age during grade school and high school years, and to say that they felt different because they were more masculine than other girls, more interested in sports, or not interested in boys. Homosexual women were also more likely to have felt sexually different. However, these feelings did not appear to play a role in the development of female homosexuality. Homosexual women, unlike heterosexual women, were sometimes labeled sexually different or homosexual before the age of 19, but such labeling also appeared to play no significant role in the development of female homosexuality. Homosexual arousal in childhood appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence had a very strong connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and sexual molestation did not appear to be significant in the development of homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood had a very small effect on adult sexual preference. Homosexual women were more likely to have their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, did not appear to play a significant role in the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality. Findings on blacks The results for black men were in general the same as those for white men, except that while the \\"Identification with Father\\" variable had some significance for white men, it had none for black men, and whereas for white men pre-adult sexual feelings were important in the development of adult homosexuality, childhood and adolescent sexual activities were important for black men. Bell et al. suggested that this finding could show that black males became homosexual due to their early homosexual activities, which was consistent with a learning theory interpretation, but that alternatively it might reflect \\"the freer sexual attitude of the black community\\", which could have allowed their black respondents to act on their sexual inclinations at an earlier age than their white respondents. The findings for black women were very similar to those for white women. Conclusions Bell et al. rejected many accepted ideas about the development of homosexuality. They concluded that psychodynamic theories exaggerate the role of parents in the development of their sons' sexual orientation, and that the psychoanalytic model that attributes male homosexuality to dominant mothers and weak fathers is inadequate. They found the idea that \\"cold, detached\\" fathers and poor father-son relationships predispose boys toward homosexuality more plausible, but emphasized that these factors have only an indirect connection to sexual preference. They suggested that relationships with parents might play a greater role in the development of female homosexuality, although they found having a cold or distant father less significant as a cause of female than of male homosexuality. They also rejected sociological theories such as the idea that homosexuality results from labeling by others. Overall, they concluded that sexual preference is likely to be already determined by the time boys and girls reach adolescence, and that there is a powerful link between gender nonconformity and the development of homosexuality in both sexes, but especially in men. Although stressing that their model \\"applies only to extant theories and does not create new ones\\", they wrote that they had identified \\"a pattern of feelings and reactions within the child that cannot be traced back to a single social or psychological root\\". Different kinds of homosexuals were compared. The \\"Identification with Father\\" variable appeared to be important in the development of homosexuality among effeminate white homosexual men. Bell et al. noted that failure to identify with the father might encourage effeminacy, but that it was also possible that boys who were effeminate for other reasons might find it difficult to identify with their fathers. Pre-adult homosexual behavior was more important among men who were not effeminate. Bell et al. suggested that for effeminate males early homosexual feelings were the only important predictor of adult homosexuality, while other males were influenced by a combination of homosexual feelings and other factors. They found that sexual preference was much less strongly connected with pre-adult sexual feelings for white bisexual men than it was for white homosexual men. They concluded that exclusive homosexuality tends to emerge from a \\"deep-seated predisposition\\" but that bisexuality is \\"more subject to influence by social and sexual learning.\\" Exclusively homosexual white men tended to report that they had not identified with their fathers, but there was no significant tendency for white bisexual men not to identify with their fathers. Only white homosexual men who had undergone psychotherapy had \\"paternal variables\\" that were consistent with what clinicians had considered typical of homosexual males. Among whites, gender nonconformity appeared to be important in the development of homosexuality among masculine homosexual women, but not among homosexual women who were not masculine, while adolescent homosexual involvement was important for non-masculine homosexual women but not masculine homosexual women. Bisexual women appeared to be more influenced by involvement in homosexual genital activities in childhood than exclusively homosexual women, but unlike exclusively homosexual women, their homosexual preference did not appear related to inability to experience heterosexual arousal in childhood. Childhood gender nonconformity appeared more significant for exclusively homosexual women than for bisexual women, and more significant for women who had been in psychotherapy than for women who had not. Bell et al. briefly reviewed the ideas of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, the physician Havelock Ellis, and the psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing. They wrote that while there was an ongoing debate over the origins of homosexuality, there is evidence supporting the view that homosexuality has a biological basis, and that hormonal factors could be involved. They could not explain how sexual preference might be related to biology, but considered their findings consistent with what one would expect to find if it had a biological basis. They suggested that biological factors have a more powerful influence on exclusive homosexuals than on bisexuals, and that if there is a biological basis to homosexuality, it accounts for gender nonconformity as well as sexual orientation. They also proposed that the \\"familial factors commonly thought to account for homosexuality\\" may actually result from the way parents react to their prehomosexual children. They argued that demonstrating that homosexuality is biologically innate would lead to greater social tolerance, and help to relieve parents of gay people of guilt. They expressed hope that researchers would eventually produce more definitive answers about the origins of homosexuality. Background and publication history Together with its separately published Statistical Appendix, Sexual Preference was the concluding volume of a series of books including Homosexuality: An Annotated Bibliography (1972) and Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women (1978), both authored jointly by Bell and Weinberg. The study was supported by the United States National Institute of Mental Health, Indiana University, the Institute for Sex Research, and the Glide Foundation. Persons assisting the study included the gay rights activists Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, the sociologists John Gagnon and William Simon, and the anthropologist Paul Gebhard. Bell wrote that in the study he had \\"borrowed heavily from the psychodynamic view of sexual development\\", while his sociologist co-authors had ensured that the study's data could be used to evaluate conditioning and labeling theory. The study's data were derived from interviews conducted in 1969 and 1970 with \\"979 homosexual and 477 heterosexual men and women living in the San Francisco Bay Area.\\" Homosexuals were recruited from a variety of locations while heterosexuals were obtained through random sampling. The interview schedule included approximately 200 questions. Most offered respondents a limited number of possible answers, though some allowed respondents to answer as they wished. Bell et al. maintained that since most of their heterosexual respondents were exclusively heterosexual, and most of their homosexual respondents predominantly or exclusively homosexual, the classification of respondents into heterosexuals and homosexuals represented \\"a natural division\\". Sexual Preference was first published in 1981 by Indiana University Press. The same year, Bertelsmann published the book in German translation as Der Kinsey Institut Report über sexuelle Orientierung und Partnerwahl. Reception Mainstream media Prior to its publication, Jane E. Brody wrote in The New York Times that Sexual Preference was likely to cause controversy because of its findings and its reliance on path analysis and its subjects' memories. Brody noted that path analysis could be misused and that it \\"can only explore existing notions, not create new ones.\\" According to Brody, Bell said that he expected the study to be condemned by both \\"radical gays\\" and psychoanalysts, the psychologist John Paul De Cecco questioned the \\"theoretical basis\\" of Sexual Preference and the reliability and validity of relying on recollections of childhood, and the psychoanalyst Irving Bieber described Bell et al.′s findings as inconsistent with his clinical experience. Sexual Preference attracted considerable media attention in 1981, receiving positive reviews from the historian Paul Robinson in Psychology Today and Richard P. Halgin in Library Journal, a negative review from the sociologist John Gagnon in The New York Times, a notice in Newsweek, and a discussion in The Chronicle of Higher Education, which focused on the controversy surrounding the book. The following year, the book received a negative review from Michael Ignatieff in the London Review of Books. The work was faulted for the questionable representativeness of its sample of homosexuals, but those who reviewed it positively praised it for the sophistication of its path analysis. Robinson suggested that Bell et al. might have misidentified gender nonconformity as a cause of homosexuality, rather than as one of its expressions, but nevertheless found Sexual Preference to be a \\"superb\\" book that answered the question of how people become heterosexual or homosexual better than any previous study, disqualified most previous answers, and was comparable to Alfred Kinsey's best work. He maintained that their study's empirical foundation and path analysis gave Bell et al.′s findings \\"unprecedented trustworthiness\\". Robinson credited Bell et al. with documenting the \\"intellectual poverty\\" of psychoanalytic hypotheses about homosexuality. He lamented that unlike Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953), which gained popular attention, Sexual Preference \\"seems destined for academic oblivion.\\" Halgin wrote that the book would be considered a landmark publication in sexology, and was more scientifically rigorous than most research in the field, but that it was also likely to create controversy. Gagnon considered Sexual Preference a politically motivated study that would inevitably be received as a political and moral statement. He noted that its authors' conclusion that the lack of correlation between sexual orientation and early family experience means that the development of heterosexuality and homosexuality must be based on a biological predisposition was controversial. He criticized their use of path analysis, arguing that it over-emphasized differences between heterosexual and homosexual patterns of development. He also wrote that their reliance on adult recall of early childhood feeling was inconsistent with all recent research on memory, suggesting that respondents' answers to the vague and general questions employed in the study might reflect a subsequent reconstruction of events rather than an accurate recall of childhood. He also criticized their decision to group together \\"the respondents' observations relating to certain behaviors and attitudes\\", and their failure to provide new biological evidence. Ignatieff wrote that even if Bell et al.′s conclusion that family upbringing and factors such as labeling have little measurable effect on adult sexual orientation was correct it would not justify their additional claim that homosexuality is biologically innate, and that they had not resolved the question of how responsible people are for their sexual orientation. In 2002, The New York Times quoted the historian and gay rights activist Martin Duberman as saying that Sexual Preference resulted from \\"the most ambitious study of male homosexuality ever attempted\\", and that together with Homosexualities it helped to \\"refuted a large number of previous studies\\" identifying gay men as \\"social misfits\\". Gay media Sexual Preference received a positive review from Robert Herron in Christopher Street and a mixed review from George Smith in The Body Politic, while in The Advocate it received a note from the editor and mixed reviews from the biologist Doug Futuym and the social scientist Richard Wagner. Herron credited Bell et al. with disproving mistaken ideas about the causes of homosexuality and described it as a \\"massively impressive achievement\\". However, he criticized the authors for their use of the term \\"sexual preference\\" and for failing to define \\"homosexuality\\". He also believed that they should have stated unambiguously, instead of simply suggesting, that homosexuality is innate, and maintained that as social scientists, they could not properly assess research on biological influences on homosexuality. Smith considered the study useful for its challenge to established views about the causes of homosexuality. However, he was unconvinced by its conclusion that homosexuality has a biological basis and found its account of the subject remote from real experience. Smith argued that while Bell et al.′s path analysis suggested that various variables cause one another, this was \\"an illusion created by statistical manipulation\\", and concluded that their category of \\"Gender Nonconformity\\" was a construct created by the researchers. The Advocate wrote that the study had received media attention for its findings that sexual orientation is not determined by parenting and may have a biological basis. It described it as \\"the major report on homosexuality in 1981\\", and noted that for budgetary reasons it was likely to be the last report on homosexuality from the Institute for Sex Research. Futuym wrote that the book had received attention from the media because of its authors' suggestion that homosexuality may have biological causes. However, he believed that they failed to demonstrate this and that other aspects of the book were more important. He noted that it was subject to criticism on the grounds that its sample of homosexuals was unrepresentative and that its subjects may have distorted their accounts of their childhoods by making them conform to their present views of themselves, and that its path analysis was open to question, and criticized its authors for failing to explain the operations of \\"childhood gender nonconformity\\". He observed that while they argued that sexual orientation might be biological because of the lack of any apparent psychosocial causes for it, it was possible that there were psychosocial causes that they had failed to investigate and that might operate early in life. He argued that a study such as theirs would be able to identify the causes of sexual orientation only if the causes were \\"few and very strong.\\" However, he believed they deserved credit for showing that there was no support for the \\"standard psychosocial theories\\" or the belief that homosexuality is caused by seduction. Wagner credited Bell et al. with distancing themselves from medical and psychiatric hostility to homosexuality, but criticized them for failing to conclude that searching for causes of homosexuality is misconceived. He believed that the media had wrongly interpreted their study as showing that homosexuality has a biological basis. He described their path analysis approach as a \\"complex theoretical model\\", and predicted that it would be a long time before it and its associated data could be \\"tested by the scientific community.\\" Nevertheless, he considered the approach open to question, arguing that it was doubtful whether causal models could explain the development of sexual preference. Scientific and academic journals, 1981–1982 Sexual Preference received a positive review from J. Kenneth Davidson, Sr. in the Journal of Marriage and Family, mixed reviews from the sociologist John DeLamater in Science and the sex researcher James D. Weinrich in The Quarterly Review of Biology, and negative reviews from the psychologist Clarence Tripp in the Journal of Sex Research and the sociologist Ira Reiss in Contemporary Sociology. The book was also discussed by DeCecco in the Journal of Sex Research and Bell in Siecus Report. Criticisms made of the work included that its authors' conclusions were based on an unrepresentative or dubiously representative sample of homosexuals, and that their reliance on path analysis and adult recall of early childhood feeling was problematic. Davidson wrote that Bell et al. were aware that their work would be criticized on methodological grounds, and that they carefully addressed potential criticisms. He suggested that media reports had distorted their views about the possibility than homosexuality has a biological basis, writing that they acknowledged that their study did not provide the data to resolve this issue. Although he considered it regrettable that it took them more than a decade to publish their analysis of their study's data, and believed it was \\"directed more toward the lay reader than to the professional community\\", he found their work valuable for its exploration of the possible biological basis of homosexuality. DeLamater believed that Sexual Preference benefited from Bell et al.′s \\"eclectic theoretical basis\\", which drew from the psychodynamic model, social learning theory, sociological models that emphasize the importance of peer relationships, and labeling theory. However, while he accepted their claim that their study was methodologically superior to prior work on homosexuals, he still found it problematic for many reasons and hesitated to endorse its conclusions. In his view, the path analysis involved \\"arbitrary classification and sequencing of variables\\". Weinrich wrote that while Bell et al. had a \\"more than adequate sample size\\", the sample had at times been broken down into smaller groups, and some of their conclusions about those groups had to be considered tentative. Weinrich concluded that they effectively challenged environmental theories of sexual orientation, and that attempts by critics to dismiss their conclusions about such theories were unsuccessful. He based this conclusion partly on personal communication with Hammersmith, however, noting that they did not explain their procedures for verifying their findings well in Sexual Preference and its statistical appendix. He also suspected that they had relied on dubious information from heterosexuals about the sexual orientation of their siblings, and considered their review of evidence on the possible biological basis of homosexuality inadequate. Sex researcher Alfred Kinsey. The psychologist Clarence Tripp criticized Bell et al. for abandoning many of Kinsey's methods and conclusions. Tripp wrote that Sexual Preference would likely be seen as \\"a shock and a disappointment\\", since its authors abandoned or misrepresented many of Kinsey's methods and conclusions. He criticized them for ignoring Kinsey's warning to make careful observations and \\"avoid theory\\", and for attempting to test the validity of psychoanalytic theories, which he considered already discredited by professionals. While he nevertheless believed that they had rendered a valuable service by showing that psychoanalytic theories are unsupported, he rejected their argument that since psychoanalytic ideas are incorrect the origins of sexual orientation must be genetic and hormonal, noting that in order to draw that conclusion they had to ignore the work of sex researchers such as Frank Beach. He also accused them of citing low quality and unreplicated hormone studies, ignoring evidence relating homosexuality to early puberty, and replacing inductive with deductive methods. In the same issue, they replied to Tripp, accusing him of misrepresenting their data analysis and their conclusions and making \\"ridiculous criticisms\\" of the scientific method they had employed. Tripp responded in a later issue, accusing them of making personal attacks, and attempting to refute them on specific points. Reiss concluded that Sexual Preference helped suggest \\"the likely worth of ideas\\", but that given its shortcomings there was no way in which its authors could definitively resolve the issues they explored, despite their claim to \\"once and for all\\" discredit some ideas about homosexuality. He wrote that the study employed questions that were \\"vague\\" and \\"open-ended\\", and that its authors had an \\"arbitrary and rigid conception\\" of what could be done with their data, lacked \\"theoretical development\\" in its handling, and deliberately minimized the importance of the predictor variables they used to test psychoanalytic and other theories. He found their conclusion that sexual orientation has a biological basis unconvincing. De Cecco dismissed both Sexual Preference and Bell and Weinberg's previous study Homosexualities, writing that while their authors presented them as definitive, they suffered from the \\"theoretical blindness\\" that has dominated research on homosexuality in the United States since the early 1970s. He contrasted Bell and Weinberg's work unfavorably with that of European thinkers whom he credited with \\"provocative theoretical speculations\\": the philosophers Michel Foucault and Guy Hocquenghem, the gay rights activist Mario Mieli, the sexologist Martin Dannecker, and the sociologist Jeffrey Weeks. Bell wrote that he was astonished by his finding that \\"parent-child relationships\\" are less influential in the development of sexual orientation than has often been thought. He related his findings to the theme of androgyny. Scientific and academic journals, 1983–1986 Cheryl L. Gillespie gave Sexual Preference a mixed review in Family Relations. She commended Bell et al. for using a sophisticated methodology and trying to avoid \\"poorly designed measures and biased interpretation of data\\". Nevertheless, she found their methodology and interpretation of data open to question, writing that although their San Francisco Bay Area sample was arguably non-representative, they wrote as though the study was representative of the larger population, that they did not sufficiently explore the issue of bias in their subjects' self-reports, which might have been motivated by the subjects' ideology or desire to please the researchers by telling them what they thought they wanted to hear, and that they relegated the fact that respondents who had been exposed to scientific information regarding homosexuality were more likely to characterize their parents in accord with psychoanalytic models of emotionally absent fathers and domineering mothers to a footnote. She also suggested that readers might find Sexual Preference boring. Thomas Ford Hoult argued in the Journal of Homosexuality that Bell et al.′s conclusion that childhood gender nonconformity and adult sexual orientation have a biological basis is a legitimate hypothesis, but one that it is not confirmed by their failure to find a direct connection between sexual orientation and parent-child interaction. Jeanne Marecek gave Sexual Preference a negative review in Sex Roles, writing that it was tedious and succeeded well neither as a popular book nor as a scientific treatment of its topic. She maintained that it lacked \\"methodological detail\\", and that its true focus was homosexuality rather than sexual preference generally. She believed that there were many problems with \\"the premises and the execution\\" of the study, writing that its authors neither broke \\"new theoretical ground\\" nor offered \\"a critical reading of old theories\\" and ignored questions such as \\"how and why adults change their sexual preference, what meanings individuals ascribe to their sexuality, and how social context contributes to stability or change in sexual preference\\". In her view, other problems included their failure to critically examine \\"the accuracy of the retrospective memories\\" of their respondents and willingness to take their answers to questions at face value. She concluded that they must have been disappointed by the results of their path analyses since, \\"Very few of the respondents' reported early experiences were related to the emergence of homosexuality.\\" She disagreed with their focus on theories relating homosexuality to childhood experience and their conclusion that \\"sexual preference is dictated by developmental experiences\\", and wrote that they seemed politically conservative despite presenting themselves as liberals. The psychoanalyst Gerard J. M. van den Aardweg criticized Bell et al.′s interpretation of their data in the American Journal of Psychotherapy. He argued that too many studies suggest that domineering mothers play a role in the development of male homosexuality for their conclusion that mothers have at most a weak influence on the development of their sons' sexual orientation to be readily acceptable, that all questionnaire studies have inherent limitations, and that their data are inferior to those collected over time by psychotherapists. He suggested that homosexuals might give defensive answers due to not wanting to be labelled abnormal, that Bell et al.′s data were of poor quality, since too few questions about parental behavior had been asked and open-ended questions yielded superficial answers, and that it was unjustified to conclude that parents must have only a small influence on the development of their children's sexual orientation simply because that influence did not reveal itself clearly. He accused Bell et al. of admitting the limitations of path analysis only to then ignore those limitations, arguing that the technique had \\"numerous dubious premises\\" and that they used it in a way that was open to technical objections such as its failure to \\"distinguish between different types of psychodynamic development to homosexuality\\". He considered them mistaken to treat their variables as isolated items, rather than in combination with each other. He also found the studies they cited as evidence that homosexuality might have a hormonal basis unconvincing. The psychologists Paul H. Van Wyk and Chrisann S. Geist wrote in the Archives of Sexual Behavior that Bell et al. question a scientific consensus, established by researchers such as the psychologists Heino Meyer-Bahlburg and John Money, that biological factors have at most only a predisposing influence on the development of sexual orientation. Using their subject pool, which consisted of people interviewed between 1938 and 1963, they produced similar results. However they suggested that some significant differences could have been partly a result of the different methodology employed. In their view, the most important difference was that their outcome variable was based only on \\"overt behavior\\" whereas that of Bell et al. \\"is an average of subjective preference and overt behavior.\\" They noted that Bell et al. \\"excluded from their model variables that did not apply to everyone in their sample\\", which made it impossible to judge the effects of \\"idiosyncratic and unique sexual and nonsexual experiences\\". The philosopher Michael Ruse credited Bell et al. with avoiding the problems of earlier studies, such as Bieber et al.′s Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals (1962), in Behavioral and Brain Sciences. Scientific and academic journals, 1987–1996 De Cecco wrote in the Journal of Sex Research that Sexual Preference had no independent theoretical basis because it was conceived as an attempt to disprove theories viewing homosexuality as a mental or social pathology, and that Bell et al. were mistaken to conclude that, because such theories are incorrect, sexual orientation must be innate. He accused them of being motivated by \\"a misguided compassion for homosexuals\\", arguing that such compassion is actually a form of arrogance. The philosopher Frederick Suppe described Sexual Preference as very important study in the Journal of Homosexuality. He wrote that it failed to duplicate the findings of Bieber et al. or the predictions of symbolic interactionism, labeling theory, and societal reaction theory approaches. He considered its sample of homosexuals, while highly biased, to nevertheless be the most representative ever made, and argued that biased samples can be adequate for the purposes of refuting theories propounded in other studies \\"so long as the types of subjects used in those other studies constitute a subsample of the replicative study′s sample and the latter's population does not go beyond the claimed scope of the replicated studies.\\" He maintained that Bell et al.′s study meets these requirements, that their use of path analysis was appropriate, and that their procedures for developing a composite etiology model, which contained \\"virtually all paths advanced in the literature\\", are legitimate. He argued that the only plausible basis for disputing that the study definitively refutes \\"social learning theories of homosexual etiology\\" is to challenge the adequacy of its authors' models and the questions they employed. However, he criticized the questions asked. He wrote that while Bell et al. did not use the same specific questions that Bieber et al. had employed, they did use \\"questions directed at the same concerns.\\" He noted that their data regarding subjects′ negative feelings toward and relationships with their fathers were based on open-ended interview questions, adding that it would have been preferable had they employed the same \\"structured-answer questions\\" used in Bieber et al.′s earlier study. He rejected their claim that their study supports a biological explanation of sexual orientation. He wrote that since their study, research into the \\"social causes of homosexuality\\" has become \\"moribund.\\" The social psychologist Daryl Bem credited Bell et al. with providing the most important data concerning \\"experience-based theories\\" of the development of sexual orientation in Psychological Review. This included \\"the classical psychoanalytic account\\", as well as views that attribute the origins of sexual orientation to learning, conditioning, seduction, or labeling. According to Bem, their finding that \\"no family variables\\" are \\"strongly implicated in the development of sexual orientation for either men or women\\" is \\"consistent with accumulating evidence that family variables account for much less of the environmental variance in personality than previously thought\\". He proposed a hypothesis, which he referred to as \\"Exotic becomes erotic\\", according to which children feel different from either their same-sex peers or opposite-sex peers and therefore eroticize them, leading to homosexuality and heterosexuality respectively. He referred to Bell et al.′s finding that gay men and lesbians were significantly more likely to recall having felt different from same-sex children during the grade-school years, and to other studies that drew similar conclusions. He maintained that Bell's view that people become erotically attracted to those who are different from them out of a \\"quest for androgyny\\" does not accurately characterize or explain the data, and rejected Bell et al.′s conclusion that sexual orientation is innate. Scientific and academic journals, 1997–present Letitia Anne Peplau et al. wrote in a critique of Bem's \\"exotic becomes erotic\\" hypothesis published in Psychological Review that Bell et al. recruited heterosexuals and homosexuals through non-comparable methods, and that while it is unknown how this and the retrospective nature of their data affected their findings, \\"they may have exaggerated the extent of true differences between heterosexual and homosexual respondents.\\" Peplau et al. argued that Bell et al.′s data does not support Bem's hypothesis. Bem, in a defense of his hypothesis published in the same issue of Psychological Review, wrote that in their path analysis Bell et al. engaged in \\"an unfortunate dichotomization of the dependent variable, sexual orientation ... grouping the bisexual and homosexual respondents into the same category.\\" In his view, while this procedure \\"might have seemed reasonable on a priori grounds ... it should have been abandoned as soon as the researchers saw the results of their own subanalyses, which made it clear that the bisexual respondents were not only very different from their exclusively homosexual counterparts but actually were more like the heterosexual respondents in theoretically critical ways.\\" He argued that by grouping together the bisexuals and homosexuals Bell et al. \\"reduced many of the correlations and increased the likelihood that important antecedent variables would be erroneously eliminated during the recursive process of discarding the weaker correlates from successive iterations of the path model.\\" Peplau et al. wrote in the Annual Review of Sex Research that while Bell et al.′s suggestion that biological factors have a stronger influence on exclusive homosexuality than they have on bisexuality may seem plausible, it has not been directly tested and appears to conflict with available evidence, such as that concerning prenatal hormone exposure. The psychologist Bruce Rind credited Bell et al. with disproving psychoanalytic theories about the development of homosexuality, along with the idea that childhood seduction causes homosexuality, in the Archives of Sexual Behavior. The psychologist Mark Yarhouse wrote in the Archives of Sexual Behavior that Sexual Preference relies on retrospective memory recall, which can be unreliable. The psychologist J. Michael Bailey and his co-authors described Sexual Preference as a \\"landmark study\\" that \\"seemingly disposed of the idea that homosexuality resulted from the quality of parent-child relationships\\" in Psychological Science in the Public Interest. Other evaluations, 1981–1987 The gay rights activist Dennis Altman noted that Bell et al.′s conclusion that there is a powerful link between gender nonconformity and the development of homosexuality depended on the memories of their respondents, who were likely to have been influenced by social expectations about how homosexuals should conform to gender roles. He observed that Bell et al.′s data was collected in 1969 and 1970, prior to the \\"growth of the modern gay movement and the development of the macho style among gay men\\", and criticized them for confusing \\"social roles with what is inborn\\", thereby underestimating the extent to which masculinity and femininity are social constructs. The psychologist William Paul and the sex researcher Weinrich maintained that Sexual Preference documented social diversity well and was the largest study conducted specifically on homosexuality, but that it was limited by the problems Bell et al. encountered in trying to obtain a representative sample. They suggested that because Bell et al. collected their data in 1969, they may have missed \\"cultural developments in the gay younger generation of the late 1960s and early 1970s.\\" The gynecologist William Masters, the sexologist Virginia E. Johnson and the physician Robert C. Kolodny suggested that Sexual Preference was probably the most extensive study of homosexuality and maintained that it provided no support for Bieber's theory of homosexuality. Daniel Rancour-Laferriere credited Bell et al. with helping to support the idea that adult sexual preference has a biological basis, and with showing that a biological basis for homosexuality probably accounts for gender nonconformity as well as sexual orientation. He endorsed their view that the unfavorable relationships homosexual men tend to have with their fathers could be as likely to result from \\"the homosexual predisposition\\" of the child as the father's behavior. Weeks described Sexual Preference as \\"the Kinsey Institute's final publication on homosexuality\\". He suggested that like sociobiologists and others who have attempted to find a biological explanation for social behavior Bell et al. had an \\"urge to fill a conceptual gap\\" stronger than their \\"adherence to theoretical consistency and political judgment\\". He wrote that while Bell et al. carefully explored the evidence for the aetiology of homosexuality, unlike Kinsey they failed to consider that homosexuality might not be a single phenomenon with a single explanation. He criticized them for concluding that if a social or psychological explanation of homosexuality cannot be found then a biological explanation must exist, deeming the argument \\"a rhetorical device\\" that results in \\"an intellectual closure which obstructs further questioning.\\" The sociologists Frederick L. Whitam and Robin Mathy criticized Bell et al. for reporting mainly on their white subjects. The sexologist Richard Green described Sexual Preference as one of several studies, including Bieber et al.′s Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals, to have found strained relationships between fathers and homosexual sons. He added that an unresolved question in such studies is what percent of heterosexuals give answers more typical of homosexuals and what percent of homosexuals give answers more typical of heterosexuals, and that such \\"contradictory\\" outcomes require explanation. Other evaluations, 1988–1989 The psychoanalyst Richard C. Friedman maintained that despite the differing perspectives of their authors, the studies by Bell et al. and Bieber et al. were \\"in basic agreement with regard to childhood gender identity / gender role abnormalities in pre-homosexual children.\\" He considered Bell et al.′s claim that path analysis made it possible to give each influence on homosexuality a particular weight at a particular time of childhood development unlikely, since retrospective methods cannot be converted to prospective methods. He wrote that the meaning of data depends on the models used to interpret them, and that Bell et al.′s models differ from those accepted by \\"psychodynamically oriented investigators.\\" The sociologist Miriam M. Johnson described Bell et al.′s study as the \\"largest, best-designed, and one of the least heterosexist investigations\\" of the development of sexual preference. In her view, its only possible bias is that because of its nature and San Francisco location \\"activist\\" homosexuals were over-represented. Johnson argued that \\"this bias would probably work against finding support for any hypotheses concerning parental influences, because activist homosexuals have ordinarily been opposed to psychoanalytic speculations about parental involvements.\\" Johnson concluded, however, that the study's credibility was enhanced by the fact that Bell et al. took into account whether their respondents had been exposed to books or articles about the etiology of homosexuality, and disregarded results when they could be explained by such exposure. Johnson credited Bell et al. with showing that \\"almost all the alleged causes of adult sexual orientation are either nonexistent or highly exaggerated\\", but considered their claim that they had refuted psychoanalytic theories that attribute homosexuality to an unresolved Oedipus complex only \\"half true\\", given the father findings. Ruse observed that Bell et al.′s findings about the parental backgrounds of heterosexuals and homosexuals were \\"slanted in the way a Freudian would expect\\", adding that many other studies have pointed to very similar conclusions. Ruse argued that there is much to support Bell et al.′s conclusion that Freudian explanations of homosexuality confuse the direction of cause and effect and that the cold and distant relationships gay men report having with their fathers are a result of parental reactions to effeminate or sensitive sons. However, he noted that the accuracy of Bell et al.′s findings is open to doubt for many reasons: their subjects could have been unwittingly giving them the answers they wanted to hear, failed to remember accurately, or suppressed painful childhood memories. The ethologist Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt stated that modern medicine was rejecting psychoanalytic theories about the origins of homosexuality, pointing to Bell et al.′s conclusion that \\"pure homosexuals can scarcely be modified by their environment whereas bisexuals are accessible with social learning\\" as an example of this process. The psychologist Seymour Fisher described Sexual Preference as a high quality study. He argued that Bell et al.′s findings support some of Freud's predictions about how homosexual men view their parents, writing that despite their claim that there is no strong connection, the \\"negative father\\" factor had a detectable impact on \\"gender nonconformity and early homosexual experience\\" for men. He maintained that they provided no information that could be used to evaluate Freud's vague statements concerning how homosexual women would perceive their mothers, but that their data does support his expectation that they would perceive their fathers in negative terms, despite their deliberately minimizing the overall importance of the father factor in the development of female homosexuality. He viewed their findings about lesbianism as especially significant since their study was published in 1981 and had a large diverse sample. He argued that their finding that recalled patterns of relationships with mother and father predicted homosexual preferences during adolescence, but not the likelihood of being primarily homosexual as an adult, could be explained by the fact that only some of those willing to engage in homosexual sex during their earlier years are able to do so as they leave adolescence, which might make it more difficult to find correlations between early parent-child relationships and \\"later overt homosexuality.\\" The neuropsychologist Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen described Sexual Preference as a \\"pathbreaking study\\" which shows that parents are not \\"to blame for their 'sexually messed up' children\\". Other evaluations, 1990–1997 The philosopher Edward Stein maintained that Bell et al.′s data undermine the hypothesis that a person's sexual orientation is determined by the sex of the first person he or she has sex with. Gonsiorek and Weinrich maintained that Bell et al.′s view that sexual orientation is set by early childhood is also held by most other experts on the topic, including Green and Money. They described Bell et al. as \\"essentialists\\", who, unlike supporters of social constructionism, maintain that \\"homosexual desire, identity, and persons exist as real in some form, in different cultures and historical eras\\". Gonsiorek and Douglas C. Haldeman both credited Bell et al. with disproving psychoanalytic theories about the development of homosexuality. The economist Richard Posner credited Bell et al. with providing evidence that \\"childhood gender nonconformity is a good predictor of both male and female homosexuality\\". He also believed that they showed that boys are not more likely to become homosexual the more adult siblings they have, and provided evidence against the idea that adult homosexuality results from seduction or early homosexual experiences. The psychologist Kenneth Zucker and the psychiatrist Susan Bradley described Sexual Preference as a \\"classic study\\". They maintained that its data, including its finding that \\"detached-hostile father\\" is relatively characteristic of a majority of the white homosexual men in their study and a minority of white heterosexual men, are consistent with those of previous clinical research, including Bieber et al.′s study. They wrote that the psychoanalytic perspective that views homosexuality as a mental disorder and explains it in terms of family dynamics influenced the way in which Bell et al. conducted their inquiry, and that Sexual Preference must be understood in the context of sexual politics. They suggested that because homosexuality had been delisted as a mental disorder for eight years by the time the book was published, Bell et al. faced a problem if their data \\"showed a departure from an ideal of optimal functioning in homosexual men\\". They argued that, because of their concern for homosexuals, and also influenced by political correctness, Bell et al. deliberately minimized the \\"observed significant effects\\" shown by their study, though they noted that this was also in part an objective interpretation of weak effects. They wrote that prior to Bell et al.′s study, researchers were aware that phenomena usually interpreted as parents influencing their children could be interpreted instead as the reverse, and that Bell et al. recognized that \\"the direction of effects\\" was a \\"problematic aspect of their research design\\". In their view, resolving the \\"direction-of- effects issue\\" raised by Bell et al. through retrospective studies comparing homosexual with heterosexual men will be difficult, and that until then the issue will remain \\"a matter of theoretical taste.\\" The philosopher Timothy F. Murphy described Sexual Preference as an important study of homosexuality, adding that despite its limitations and flaws, it, like the Kinsey Reports and Homosexualities, should be considered a useful part of a scientific process of \\"measuring the adequacy of hypotheses and evidence\\". John Heidenry suggested that Sexual Preference was the most important book on sexuality published in the early 1980s. He wrote that Bell et al. \\"analyzed every known hypothesis, idea, or suggestion about the origins of homosexuality and found most of them were wrong.\\" He credited them with avoiding the biases of many previous studies, which had drawn their samples from unrepresentative sources such as psychotherapy patients or prison populations, but noted that they failed to identify the cause of homosexuality. He observed that their suggestion that homosexuality may have a biological basis placed them in opposition to Kinsey's views, and that they ignored research that correlated the origins of same-sex preference with factors such as time of puberty, the amount of early sex, and masturbatory patterns. Other evaluations, 1998–present The anthropologist Gilbert Herdt argued that Sexual Preference, like the Kinsey scale, places \\"too much emphasis upon discrete acts of sex and not enough stress upon the cultural context and total developmental outcomes to which those acts are related.\\" He called the study a \\"quantitative sociological\\" survey of homosexuality that decontextualizes \\"the culture and lives at issue\\", arguing that all developmental changes need to be viewed in the context of social structure. Stein described Sexual Preference as one of the most detailed and frequently cited retrospective studies relating to sexual orientation. In his view, while the study has been criticized on various grounds, including that all of its subjects were living in San Francisco, arguably an atypical place with respect to the sexual orientation of its inhabitants, Bell et al.′s conclusions about theories attributing sexual orientation to the effects of experience have been accepted and confirmed. He observed that many other studies have been conducted on childhood gender nonconformity partly because of Bell et al.′s findings relating it to homosexuality. The psychologists Stanton L. Jones and Mark Yarhouse described Sexual Preference as a famous study. They maintained that because Bell et al.′s data suggest that mothers have only a weak influence on the development of homosexuality their work is \\"sometimes thought of as the study that discredited the psychoanalytic theory.\\" However, they observed that in Bell et al.′s sample \\"considerably more homosexual males reported fathers who were detached or not affectionate than did heterosexual men\\", and concluded that, \\"While clearly not providing definitive support for the psychoanalytic hypothesis, this study is surely not the refutation of that hypothesis that it is sometimes supposed to be.\\" The historian Laurie Guy observed that the type of evidence on which Sexual Preference relied, adult recollection of childhood, had been criticized by Gagnon and Simon as long ago as 1973. He argued that gay rights organizations in New Zealand over-relied upon the work in the debate that preceded the passage of the Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986, writing that while important, it was only one study, and as such did not support gay rights activist claims that \\"all evidence\\" shows that sexual orientation is fixed early in life. Judith A. Allen and her co-authors wrote that Sexual Preference, like Homosexualities, abandoned Kinsey's understanding of human sexuality by focusing on homosexual people rather than homosexual behavior and rejecting the idea that categorizing people as homosexual was problematic. Position of the American Psychological Association The American Psychological Association, in \\"Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation\\", a document released in 2009, credited Bell et al. and other authors with discrediting theories claiming that sexual orientation is caused by family dynamics or trauma.

He proposed a theory of pre-Portuguese Christianity in Goa. Jose Cosme Costa reports that Mascarenhas even proposed that there were Christian temples dedicated to the persons of the Trinity: Abanath / Bhutnath (Father Lord), Ravalnath (from Rabboni - Rabulna - Rabulnath) / Bhai rav (Brother Lord), and Atman / Bhavka Devta, Santeri, Ajadevi (Spirit).See Mascarenhas, Konkannachem Apostolik Kristanvponn cited by J.

It carries on the traditions of the elite 1/38 Evzone Regiment (1/38 Σύνταγμα Ευζώνων, 1/38 ΣΕ).  History  The 1/38 Evzone Regiment was formed in Karditsa, Thessaly, as the 1st Evzone Regiment (1° Σύνταγμα Ευζώνων) shortly before the outbreak of the Balkan Wars, from the 8th and 9th independent Evzone battalions. It participated in the Balkan Wars, initially as part of the 6th Infantry Division, fighting in the battles of Sarantaporos, Giannitsa, Bizani (where it played a distinguished role under Major Ioannis Velissariou), Kilkis–Lachanas and Kresna–Djumaya (where the regiment lost almost half its strength and all three of its battalion commanders). After the Balkan Wars, the regiment was based in Larissa. In May 1917, during the National Schism, the French Army, in support of the Venizelist Provisional Government of National Defence at Thessaloniki, entered Thessaly and ordered the disarmament of the Greek military units in the region, still loyal to the royal government in Athens. The regiment refused to obey the command to surrender its weapons, and retreated west towards the mountains. The French launched a pursuit of the unit, encircling it and forcing it to surrender. The unit was disbanded and most of its officers were imprisoned until August, when, after the exile of King Constantine I and the assumption of the government by Venizelos, Greece formally entered World War I on the side of the Entente. Evzones of the 1/38 attack in Asia Minor, August 1921 The 1/38 Regiment was re-formed at Larissa as part of the 1st Infantry Division, and participated in the Macedonian front operations in 1918, recapturing the city of Serres. The regiment subsequently fought in the Asia Minor Campaign from the Greek landing at Smyrna on 2 May 1919 until its final retreat from Asia Minor on 1 September 1922. On 10 November 1921, the regiment was awarded the highest Greek military distinction, the Commander's Cross of the Cross of Valour, for its performance in the field. After its return from Asia Minor, the regiment demobilized and returned to its peacetime garrison at Larissa. It remained there, under the 1st Infantry Division, until the Army reorganization of 1929, when it was disbanded. In December 1975, the 121st Special Covering Regiment (121 ΕΣΠ) at Ano Kalamonas in Rhodes, was renamed into the 38th Hellenic Gendarmerie Command (38η Διοίκηση Ταγμάτων Ελληνικής Χωροφυλακής, 38 ΔΤΕΧ), reviving the traditions of the 1/38. This connection was further emphasized in September 2000, when the unit received its current name, 1/38 National Guard Command \\"Bizani\\" (1/38 Διοίκηση Ταγμάτων Εθνοφυλακής «ΜΠΙΖΑΝΙ»).

In 1950, construction began on the construction of a tunnel to Sakhalin, with Cape Lazarev to be the location of the western (mainland) portal. Construction was abandoned after Stalin's death in 1953, without any of the actual tunnel being dug. However, some construction shafts are still visible near the settlement.History of the Sakhalin Tunnel under Stalin (Russian) The village received urban-type settlement status in 1952, at which point its name was shortened to simply \\"Lazarev\\". Economy The town's two main employers are the timber and natural gas industries. There is a pumping station for gas and oil from Sakhalin. During the Soviet era, the town also had some fishing activity.

This is why they used to be referred to as electro-mechanical clutches or brakes. Over the years, EM became known as electromagnetic versus electro mechanical, referring more about their actuation method versus physical operation. Since the clutches started becoming popular over 60 years ago, the variety of applications and brake and clutch designs has increased dramatically, but the basic operation remains the same. This article is about the working principles of single face friction plate clutches and brakes. In this article, clutches and brakes are referred to as (mechanical) couplings. Construction A horseshoe magnet (A-1) has a north and south pole. If a piece of carbon steel contacts both poles, a magnetic circuit is created. In an electromagnetic coupling, the north and south pole is created by a coil shell and a wound coil. Image:A-1 horseshoe-magnet-red-silver-iron-filings- AHD.jpgA-1 Horseshoe magnet Image:B-1 electromagnetic-clutch1.pngB-1 Electromagnetic clutch Image:A-2 Ogura VCEH clutch.jpgA-2 Ogura Industrial Typical 2 pole clutch Image:A-4 triple flux clutch.jpgA-4 Triple flux clutch Image:A-6 Double Flux.JPGA-6 Double Flux clutch Image:A-7 Triple flux rotor with banana slots and bridges.jpgA-7 Triple flux rotor with banana slots and bridges File:A-3_electromagnetic-brake1.pngA-3 Electromagnetic brake Clutches In a clutch, (B1) when power is applied, a magnetic field is created in the coil (A2 blue). This field (flux) overcomes an air gap between the clutch rotor (A2 yellow) and the armature (A2 red). This magnetic attraction, pulls the armature in contact with the rotor face. The frictional contact, which is being controlled by the strength of the magnetic field, is what causes the rotational motion to start. The torque comes from the magnetic attraction, of the coil and the friction between the steel of the armature and the steel of the clutch rotor or brake field. For many industrial couplings, friction material is used between the poles. The material is mainly used to help decrease the wear rate, but different types of material can also be used to change the coefficient of friction (torque for special applications). For example, if the coupling is required to have an extended time to speed/stop or slip time, a low coefficient friction material can be used. Conversely, if a coupling is required to have a slightly higher torque (mostly for low rpm applications), a high coefficient friction material can be used. The electromagnetic lines of flux have to attract and pull the armature in contact with it to complete engagement. Most industrial couplings use what is called a single flux, two pole design (A-2). Mobile clutches of other specialty electromagnetic clutches can use a double or triple flux rotor (A-4). The double or trip flux refers to the number of north–south flux paths (A-6), in the rotor and armature. These slots (banana slots) (A-7) create an air gap which causes the flux path to take the path of least resistance when the faces are engaged. This means that, if the armature is designed properly and has similar banana slots, what occurs is a leaping of the flux path, which goes north south, north south (A-6). By having more points of contact, the torque can be greatly increased. In theory, if there were 2 sets of poles at the same diameter, the torque would double in a clutch. Obviously, that is not possible to do, so the points of contact have to be at a smaller inner diameter. Also, there are magnetic flux losses because of the bridges between the banana slots. But by using a double flux design, a 30–50% increase in torque, can be achieved, and by using a triple flux design, a 40–90% in torque can be achieved. This is important in applications where size and weight are critical, such as automotive requirements. The coil shell is made with carbon steel that has a combination of good strength and good magnetic properties. Copper (sometimes aluminum) magnet wire, is used to create the coil, which is held in shell either by a bobbin or by some type of epoxy/adhesive. To help increase life in applications, friction material is used between the poles. This friction material is flush with the steel on the coil shell or rotor, since if the friction material was not flush, good magnetic traction could not occur between the faces. Some people look at electromagnetic clutches and mistakenly assume that, since the friction material is flush with the steel, that the clutch has already worn down, but this is not the case. Clutches used in most mobile applications, (automotive, agriculture, construction equipment) do not use friction material. Their cycle requirements tend to be lower than industrial clutches, and their cost is more sensitive. Also, many mobile clutches are exposed to outside elements, so by not having friction material, it eliminates the possibility of swelling (reduced torque), that can happen when friction material absorbs moisture. Brakes In an electromagnetic brake, the north and south pole is created by a coil shell and a wound coil. In a brake, the armature is being pulled against the brake field. (A-3) The frictional contact, which is being controlled by the strength of the magnetic field, is what causes the rotational motion to stop. Basic operation Engagement of clutches The clutch has four main parts: field, rotor, armature, and hub (output) (B1). When voltage is applied the stationary magnetic field generates the lines of flux that pass into the rotor. (The rotor is normally connected to the part that is always moving in the machine.) The flux (magnetic attraction) pulls the armature in contact with the rotor (the armature is connected to the component that requires the acceleration), as the armature and the output start to accelerate. Slipping between the rotor face and the armature face continues until the input and output speed is the same (100% lockup). The actual time for this is quite short, between 1/200th of a second and 1 second. Engagement of brakes There are three parts to an electromagnetic brake: field, armature, and hub (which is the input on a brake) (A-3). Usually the magnetic field is bolted to the machine frame (or uses a torque arm that can handle the torque of the brake). So when the armature is attracted to the field the stopping torque is transferred into the field housing and into the machine frame decelerating the load. This can happen very fast (.1-3sec). Disengagement Disengagement is very simple. Once the field starts to degrade, flux falls rapidly and the armature separates. One or more springs hold the armature away from its corresponding contact surface at a predetermined air gap. Voltage/current and the magnetic field V-1 Right hand thumb rule If a piece of copper wire was wound, around the nail and then connected to a battery, it would create an electro magnet. The magnetic field that is generated in the wire, from the current, is known as the \\"right hand thumb rule\\". (V-1) The strength of the magnetic field can be changed by changing both wire size and the amount of wire (turns). EM couplings are similar; they use a copper wire coil (sometimes aluminum) to create a magnetic field. The fields of EM couplings can be made to operate at almost any DC voltage, and the torque produced by the clutch or brake will be the same, as long as the correct operating voltage and current is used with the correct coupling. If a 90 V clutch, a 48 V clutch and a 24 V clutch, all being powered with their respective voltages and current, all would produce the same amount of torque. However, if a 90 V clutch had 48 V applied to it, this would get about half of the correct torque output of that clutch. This is because voltage/current is almost linear to torque in DC electromagnetic couplings. A constant power supply is ideal if accurate or maximum torque is required from a coupling. If a non-regulated power supply is used, the magnetic flux will degrade, as the resistance of the coil goes up. Basically, the hotter the coil gets the lower the torque will be, by about an average of 8% for every 20 °C. If the temperature is fairly constant, but there may not be enough service factor in your design for minor temperature fluctuation. Over-sizing, the clutch would compensate for minor flux. This will allow the use a rectified power supply which is far less expensive than a constant current supply. Based on V = I × R, as resistance increases available current falls. An increase in resistance, often results from rising temperature as the coil heats up, according to: Rf = Ri × [1 + αCu × (Tf - Ti)] Where Rf = final resistance, Ri = initial resistance, αCu = copper wire's temperature coefficient of resistance, 0.0039 °C-1, Tf = final temperature, and Ti = initial temperature. Engagement time There are actually two engagement times to consider in an electromagnetic coupling. The first one is the time it takes for a coil to develop a magnetic field, strong enough to pull in an armature. Within this, there are two factors to consider. The first one is the amount of ampere turns in a coil, which will determine the strength of a magnetic field. The second one is air gap, which is the space between the armature and the coil shell or rotor. Magnetic lines of flux diminish quickly in the air. The further away the attractive piece is from the coil, the longer it will take for that piece to actually develop enough magnetic force to be attracted and pull in to overcome the air gap. For very high cycle applications, floating armatures can be used that rest lightly against the coil shell or rotor. In this case, the air gap is zero; but, more importantly the response time is very consistent since there is no air gap to overcome. Air gap is an important consideration especially with a fixed armature design because as the unit wears over many cycles of engagement the armature and the rotor will create a larger air gap which will change the engagement time of the clutch. In high cycle applications, where registration is important, even the difference of 10–15 milliseconds can make a difference, in registration of a machine. Even in a normal cycle application, this is important because a new machine that has accurate timing can eventually see a \\"drift\\" in its accuracy as the machine gets older. The second factor in figuring out response time of a coupling is actually much more important than the magnet wire or the air gap. It involves calculating the amount of inertia that the coupling needs to accelerate. This is referred to as \\"time to speed\\". In reality, this is what the end-user is most concerned with. Once it is known how much inertia is present for the clutch to start or for the brake to stop, then the torque can be calculated and the appropriate size of clutch can be chosen. Most CAD systems can automatically calculate component inertia, but the key to sizing a brake or clutch is calculating how much inertia is reflected back to the clutch or brake. To do this, engineers use the formula: T = (WK2 × ΔN) / (308 × t) Where T = required torque in lb-ft, WK2 = total inertia in lb-ft2, ΔN = change in the rotational speed in rpm, and t = time during which the acceleration or deceleration must take place. There are also online sites that can help confirm how much torque is required to decelerate or accelerate a given amount of inertia over a specific time. Remember to make sure that the torque chosen, for the clutch or brake, should be after it has been burnished. Inertia Calculator Burnishing Burnishing is the wearing or mating of opposing surfaces. When the armature and rotor or brake faces are produced, the faces are machined as flat as possible. (Some manufacturers also lightly grind the faces to get them smoother.) But even with that the machining process leaves peaks and valleys on the surface of the steel. When a new \\"out of the box\\" coupling is initially engaged most peaks on both mating surfaces touch which means that the potential contact area can be significantly reduced. In some cases, an out of box coupling can have only 50% of its torque rating. Burnishing is the process of cycling the coupling to wear down those initial peaks, so that there is more surface contact between the mating faces. Even though burnishing is required to get full torque out of the coupling, it may not be required in all applications. Simply put, if the application torque is lower than the initial out of box torque of the coupling, burnishing is not required however, if the torque required is higher, then burnishing needs to be done. In general, this tends to be required more on higher torque couplings than on smaller torque couplings. The process involves cycling the coupling a number of times at a lower inertia, lower speed or a combination of both. Burnishing can require anywhere from 20 to over 100 cycles depending upon the size of a coupling and the amount of initial torque required. For bearing mounted couplings, where the rotor and armature are connected and held in place via a bearing, burnishing does not have to take place on the machine. It can be done individually on a bench or in a group burnishing station. If a clutch has a separate armature and rotor (two piece unit) burnishing is done as a matched set, to make sure proper torque is achieved. Similarly, two-piece brakes that have separate armatures should be burnished on a machine rather than a bench because any change in the mounting tolerance as that brake is mounted to the machine may shift the alignment so the burnishing lines on the armature, rotor or brake face may be off, slightly preventing that brake from achieving full torque. Again, the difference is only slight so this would only be required in a very torque sensitive application. Torque Burnishing can affect initial torque of a coupling but there are also factors that affect the torque performance of a coupling in an application. The main one is voltage/current. In the voltage/current section, it was shown why a constant current supply is important to get full torque out of a coupling. When considering torque, the question of using dynamic or static torque for the application is key. For example, if a machine is running at a relatively low rpm (5–50 depending upon size) then dynamic torque is not a consideration since the static torque rating of the coupling will come closest to where the application is running. However, if a machine is running at 3,000rpm and the same full torque is required the result will not be the same because of the difference between static and dynamic torques. Almost all manufacturers put the static rated torque for their couplings in their catalog. If a specific response time is needed, the dynamic torque rating for a particular coupling at a given speed is required. In many cases, this can be significantly lower. Sometimes it can be less than ½ of the static torque rating. Most manufacturers publish torque curves showing the relationship between dynamic and static torque for a given series of couplings. (T-1) T1 Over- excitation Over-excitation is used to achieve a faster response time. It's when a coil momentarily receives a higher voltage than its nominal rating. To be effective the over excitation voltage must be significantly, but not to the point of diminishing returns, higher than the normal coil voltage. Three times the voltage typically gives around ⅓ faster response. Fifteen times the normal coil voltage will produce a 3 times faster response time. For example, a clutch coil that was rated for 6 V would need to put in 90 V to achieve the 3 times factor. With over-excitation the in-rush voltage is momentary. Although it would depend upon the size of the coil the actual time is usually only a few milliseconds. The theory is, for the coil to generate as much of a magnetic field as quickly as possible to attract the armature and start the process of acceleration or deceleration. Once the over excitation is no longer required the power supply to the clutch or brake would return to its normal operating voltage. This process can be repeated a number of times as long as the high voltage does not stay in the coil long enough to cause the coil wire to overheat. Wear It is very rare that a coil would just stop working in an electromagnetic coupling . Typically, if a coil fails it is usually due to heat which has caused the insulation of the coil wire to break down. The heat can be caused by high ambient temperature, high cycle rates, slipping or applying too high of a voltage. Bushings can be used in some clutches that have low speed, low side loads or low operating hours. At higher loads and speeds, bearing mounted field/rotors and hubs are a better option. Most brakes are flanged mounted and have bearings but some brakes are bearing mounted. Like the coils, unless bearings are stressed beyond their physical limitations or become contaminated, they tend to have a long life and they are usually the second item to wear out. The main wear in electromagnetic couplings occurs on the faces of the mating surfaces. Every time a coupling is engaged during rotation a certain amount of energy is transferred as heat. The transfer, which occurs during rotation wears both the armature and the opposing contact surface. Based upon the size of the clutch or brake, the speed and the inertia, wear rates will differ. For example, a machine that was running at 500 rpm with a clutch and is now sped up to 1000 rpm would have its wear rate significantly increased because the amount of energy required to start the same amount of inertia is a lot higher at the higher speed. With a fixed armature design a coupling will eventually simply cease to engage. This is because the air gap will eventually become too large for the magnetic field to overcome. Zero gap or auto wear armatures can wear to the point of less than one half of its original thickness, which will eventually cause missed engagements. Designers can estimate life from the energy transferred each time the brake or clutch engages. Ee = [m × v2 × τd] / [182 × (τd + τl)] Where Ee = energy per engagement, m = inertia, v = speed, τd = dynamic torque, and τl = load torque. Knowing the energy per engagement lets the designer calculate the number of engagement cycles the clutch or brake will last: L = V / (Ee × w) Where L = unit life in number of cycles, V = total engagement area, and w = wear rate. Backlash Some applications require very tight precision between all components. In these applications, even 1° of movement between the input and the output when a coupling is engaged can be a problem. This is true in many robotic applications. Sometimes the design engineers will order clutches or brakes with zero backlash but then key them to the shafts so although the clutch or brake will have zero backlash there's still minimal movement occurring between the hub or rotor in the shaft. Most applications, however, do not need true zero backlash and can use a spline type connection. Some of these connections between the armature and the hub are standard splines others are hex or square hub designs. The spline will have the best initial backlash tolerance. Typically around 2° but the spline and the other connection types can wear over time and the tolerances will increase. Environment / contamination As couplings wear they create wear particles. In some applications such as clean rooms or food handling this dust could be a contamination problem so in these applications the coupling should be enclosed to prevent the particles from contaminating other surfaces around it. But a more likely scenario is that the coupling has a better chance of getting contaminated from its environment. Obviously oil or grease should be kept away from the contact surface because they would significantly reduce the coefficient of friction which could drastically decrease the torque potentially causing failure. Oil mist or lubricated particles can also cause surface contamination. Sometimes paper dust or other contamination can fall in between the contact surfaces. This can also result in a loss of torque. If a known source of contamination is going to be present many clutch manufactures offer contamination shields that prevent material from falling in between the contact surfaces. In clutches and brakes that have not been used in a while, rust can develop on the surfaces. But in general, this is normally not a major concern since the rust is worn off within a few cycles and there is no lasting impact on the torque.

There is some speculation that Acourt may be another name for the French composer Hohannes de Alte Curie Haucourt (fl. 1390-after 1416). However, musicologist Reinhard Strohm says this theory is very unlikely as Acourt's chansons have little similarity to the surviving works by Haucourt.

The study was initiated by Gert-Jan van Ommen of the LUMC team and director of the Center for Medical Systems Biology (CMSB), to gain insight in X-chromosome variability. The data set contained significant redundancy, as each base pair was sampled an average of seven to eight times. The sequencing has been performed in close collaboration with a spin-off company, 'ServiceXS'. At the time Dr. Kriek was one of five or six people to have their entire genome sequenced, the others being James D. Watson, Craig Venter, two Yoruba-African men and possibly Dan Stoicescu of Switzerland.

Her graduate studies included mutation screening in the mentally retarded.

The date celebrates Myanmar's Declaration of Independence from the British rule on 4 January 1948. Origin In the 19th century, following three Anglo-Burmese Wars, Burma was colonized by Britain. On 1 April 1937, Burma became a separately administered colony of Great Britain and Ba Maw the first Prime Minister and Premier of Burma. Ba Maw was an outspoken advocate for Burmese self-rule and he opposed the participation of Great Britain, and by extension Burma, in World War II. He resigned from the Legislative Assembly and was arrested for sedition. In 1940, before Japan formally entered the Second World War, Aung San formed the Burma Independence Army in Japan. A major battleground, Burma was devastated during the Second World War. By March 1942, within months after they entered the war, Japanese troops had advanced on Rangoon and the British administration had collapsed. A Burmese Executive Administration headed by Ba Maw was established by the Japanese in August 1942. Beginning in late 1944, allied troops launched a series of offensives that led to the end of Japanese rule in July 1945. However, the battles were intense with much of Burma laid waste by the fighting. Although many Burmese fought initially for the Japanese, some Burmese, mostly from the ethnic minorities, also served in the British Burma Army. The Burma National Army and the Arakan National Army fought with the Japanese from 1942–44, but switched allegiance to the Allied side in 1945. Following World War II, Aung San negotiated the Panglong Agreement with ethnic leaders that guaranteed the independence of Burma as a unified state. In 1947, Aung San became Deputy Chairman of the Executive Council of Burma, a transitional government. But in July 1947, political rivals backed by the BritishThe Irrawaddy, Who killed Aung San? assassinated Aung San and several cabinet members. On 4 January 1948 at 4.20 am, the nation became an independent republic, named the Union of Burma in which the time was chosen for its auspiciousness by an astrologer, with Sao Shwe Thaik as its first President and U Nu as its first Prime Minister. Unlike most other former British colonies and overseas territories, it did not become a member of the Commonwealth.

R., 1986, Engineer in Charge, NASA, p417, https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4305/ He is arguably most widely known today as the author of Unconventional Flying Objects: a Scientific Analysis.Hill, P. R., 1995, Unconventional Flying Objects: a Scientific Analysis, Hampton Roads Publishing Company Inc., Charlottesville, VA. Background Hill was born in Odebolt, Iowa in February 1909.Obituary of Paul Richard Hill, Hampton Roads (VA) Daily Press - Apr 12, 1990. After graduating with a B.S. in mechanical engineering from University of California, Berkeley in 1936 he was Professor of Aeronautics at the Polytechnic College of Engineering in Oakland, California for three years before joining the National Advisory Committee of Aeronautics (NACA) in 1939. He continued to work in a range of senior R&D; management roles when NACA became the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958 at the NASA Langley Research Center. Hill was married to Frances Hoback Hill (d. 1999). They had one daughter, Julie M. Hill. Paul Richard Hill died on April 9, 1990 in the James River Regional Convalescent Centre, Newport News, Virginia, USA. The Paul R Hill Special Collection is held by the Archives of American Aerospace. He was awarded NASA's Exceptional Service Medal in 1969.SP-4012 NASA Historical Data Book: Volume IV, Appendix A: National Aeronautics and Space Administration Honor Awards. https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4012/vol4/appa.htm This award was \\"… granted for significant achievement or service characterized by unusual initiative or creative ability that clearly demonstrates substantial improvement in engineering, space flight, or space-related endeavors which contribute to NASA programs\\". In 1970 Hill received a citation for outstanding scientific leadership for \\"directing research applicable to space laboratories and other spacecraft.\\" NACA and NASA Research During the second world war Hill co-authored a number of technical NACA papers,Brevoort, M. J., Stickle, G. W, Hill, P.R., 1942, 'Effect of airplane design efficiency and engine economy on range', NACA.Hill, P.R., Crigler, J. L., 1943, 'The effect of altitude on bomber performance', NACA. focusing on aerodynamic aspects of aircraft performance. Hill was also involved in NACA collaboration with the Republic Aircraft Company, assisting in the design of the highly successful P-47 fighter. Hill's specific role was in the aerodynamic design.Naiman, I., Hill, P. R., 1941, 'The effect of external shape upon the drag of a scoop', NACA. In the immediate post war period Hill made a number of significant contributions to the development of ram jet technology, including establishing and supervising the Wallops Island ram jet test flight programme and authoring the first NACA technical paper on ram jet technology.Hill, P. R., 1946, 'Parameters determining performance of supersonic pilotless airplanes powered by ram-compression power plants', NACA. By the early 1950s, in part inspired by his personal interest in the 'flying saucer' or 'UFO' phenomenon, Hill began experimenting in his own time with kinesthetically controlled flying platforms. This led to an official project, which Hill initiated with Charles Zimmerman, who had been independently working on similar concepts for some time. This project designed and test flew such platforms in collaboration with the United States Air Force, the Royal Canadian Airforce and the US Office of Naval Research. The increased understanding of the aerodynamic and performance characteristics of such platforms informed future design work for the Lunar Landing Module (LM), other VTOL designs and experiments with disc shaped aircraft in the period.Zimmermann, C. H., Hill, P.R., Kennedy, T.L., 1953, 'Preliminary experimental investigation of the flight of a person supported by a jet thrust device attached to his feet', NACAHill, P. R., Kennedy, T. L., 1954, 'Flight tests of a man standing on a platform supported by a teetering rotor.' NACA.Thomas, D. E.,Thomas, D. F., Hill, P. R., 1970, 'Lunar flying platform simulator', NASA. In the early 1950s Hill was part of a specially- assembled advisory panel of \\"great men\\";Brodsky, R. F., 2006, On the Cutting Edge, Gordian Knot Books, pp31, 45-46. aerodynamicists advising Sandia Labs on problems encountered with the design of the second generation bombs (H Bombs). In addition to Hill, who at this time headed NACA's Pilotless Aircraft Division, the \\"great men\\" listed by Dr Robert F Brodsky of Sandia Labs in his memoir were Jack Northrop (founder of Northrop Aircraft), George Schairer (Chief of aerodynamics at Boeing), Ira H. Abbott (\\"a legendary engineer\\"), Ed Heinemann (Chief engineer Douglas Aircraft), Dr. Alex Charters (\\"a famous ballistician\\"), Al Sibilia (Vought aircraft chief of aerodynamics), Dr. Charles Poor (Chief Scientist Army's Ballisic Research Laboratory), and \\"several other distinguished engineers\\". It was Hill and Charters, however, whom Brodsky called the \\"heroes\\". Hill's specific contribution was in diagnosing the aerodynamic problems in the bomb design, though Brodsky acknowledges that at the time they were ignored until a year later when the Sandia scientists realized they were right. \\"Both experts were correct, but they were too far ahead of us technically\\". In 1956 the US Air Force established project HYWARDS, with the aim of developing a hypersonic design capable of up to Mach 12, as a successor to the X-15.Hansen, J. R., 1986, Engineer in Charge, NASA, Chp 12, https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4305/ch12.htm The aerospace historian, James Hansen notes that a number of NACA engineers later joined the initial HYWARDS study group at Langley Research Centre \\"notably Paul Hill, configuration and propulsion…\\". Hill made a number of important contributions, particularly in the design of hypersonic wind tunnels.Hill, P. R., 1957, 'A method of computing the transient temperature of thick walls from arbitrary variation of adiabatic-wall temperature and heat- transfer coefficient', NACA. By 1959 Hill became involved in research for a future lunar mission. A lunar study group was established under the leadership of Clint Brown who asked for the participation of six of \\"Langley's most thoughtful analysts: David Adamson, Supersonic Aerodynamics Division; Paul R. Hill, PARD; John C. Houbolt, Dynamic Loads Division; Albert A. Schy, Stability Research Division; Samuel Katzoff, Full-Scale Research Division; and Bill Michael of his own Theoretical Mechanics Division\\".Hansen, J. R., 1995, Spaceflight Revolution: NASA Langley Research Center from Sputnik to Apollo, NASA history series SP-4308, http://purl.access.gpo.gov/GPO/LPS69854 This was one of many study groups to examine a lunar mission during the period, with arguably its major contribution being in initiating the concept of rendezvous in orbit between a lander and a main spacecraft.\\". Space station research began in earnest at NASA-Langley in the early 1960s and Hill played a prominent role. The historian James Hansen describes Hill as one of two \\" key members of Langley's early space station research\\" (along with Robert Osborne),Hill, P., R., Schnitzer, E., 1962 \\"Rotating Manned Space Stations.\\" Astronautics, vol. 7, no. 9, pages 14-18. American Rocket Society. with again much of Hill's pioneering work feeding into later developments.Hall, T., D., 1994, The Architecture of Artificial Gravity Environments for Long Duration Space Habitation, Ph.D Thesis, University of Michigan. \\"Of all those who contributed to the Moon decision, the ones farthest in the background were the engineers of Langley and Goddard and Marshall, many of whom devoted their lives to spaceflight, designing dreams ...\\". Interest in Unidentified Flying Objects Hill maintained a long-term interest in Unidentified Flying Objects. He had two personal UFO sightings. The first, on July 16, 1952, was with his future wife, Frances Hoback, and was reported to the USAF Blue Book project.Hill – Hoback report of 16th July 1952. Project Bluebook archive pages MAXW-PBB12-435, MAXW-PBB12-436 and MAXW-PBB12-437; www.bluebookarchive.org/ This sighting was officially classified as aeroplanes as a flight of bombers were in the area.Hill – Hoback report of 16th July 1952 case evaluation. Project Bluebook archive page reference MAXW-PBB12-318; www.bluebookarchives.org/ The then head of Blue Book, Captain (later Major) Edward Ruppelt was later to write of the case, however, \\"The only possible solution to the sighting was that the two men (sic) had seen airplanes. We investigated this report and found that there were several B-26's from Langley AFB in the area at the time of the sighting, but none of the B-26 pilots remembered being over Hampton Roads. In fact, all of them had generally stayed well south of Norfolk until about 10:30P.M. because of thunderstorm activity northwest of Langley. Then there were other factors - the observers heard no sound and they were away from all city noises, aircraft don't carry just one or two amber lights, and the distance between the two lights was such that had they been on an airplane the airplane would have been huge or very close to the observers. And last, but not least, the man from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics was a very famous aerodynamicist and of such professional stature that if he said the lights weren't airplanes they weren't.\\"Ruppelt, E., J., 1956, Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, Doubleday, New York Hill's second personal UFO sighting, in 1962, was not reported to Blue Book, but is described in his book. Hill was a strong proponent of the extraterrestrial hypothesis, which suggests that some UFOs represent structural craft of extraterrestrial origin. After retiring from NASA he developed his analysis with the aim of demonstrating that those UFOs that are not misidentifications of mundane objects or phenomena, have a coherent and consistent set of performance characteristics that are in line with what is allowable within physical theory. Hill presented his case within his book, Unconventional Flying Objects: A Scientific Analysis. The book was published posthumously, following a number of rejections from publishers during Hill's lifetime.Interview with Julie M Hill, 2000; www.thiemeworks.com/interview-with-julie-hill-daughter-of-paul-r-hill/ Unconventional Flying Objects was well received by the ufology communityPuthoff, H. E., 1997, 'Synopsis of Unconventional Flying Objects: JSE Review', Journal of Scientific Exploration. and is widely referenced by authors interested in UFOs,Jacobs, D., M., 2000, UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge, p354, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence KS., .Haisch, B. 'UFO Skeptic' website, recommended reading page, CUFOS (undated), 'Getting involved in Ufology', recommended reading section, http://www.hyper.net/ufo.html. Interest in psi phenomenon In an interview in 2000 Hill's daughter, Julie, described her father's interest in psi research: \\"He spoke about a friend who was a psychic and experiments they did. He said he set up a pinwheel experiment – I don't know how, but he knew how to set up an experiment that would be valid – and he told me that for about a week he could turn it with his mind, with his thoughts, but after about a week he couldn't do it anymore. He also told me a story about being in a car parked on the street, he was into thought experiments, and he said he projected a thought into her mind to get into my car, and as the woman was walking by the car she stopped, opened the door and sat down and looked at him, and I don't know if she shrieked or what but she was absolutely stunned at what she was doing. He said, I willed her to get into the car, and she did. I think he was as shocked as she was. They were both shocked. He told me when I was in my late teens, and this was before Shirley Maclaine and astral projection, that when he slept, he could float out of his body at night and float on the ceiling and look down and watch himself sleep. He never said he went anywhere or saw fantastic things, just that he left his body and watched himself sleep\\". None of these experiments were subject to peer review or published in any other way, however.

It held that an education institution may not discriminate against students in terms of the fees they charge on grounds of nationality. The judgment did not concern maintenance grants from the government. In order to claim those, the European Court of Justice's (ECJ) decisions in Bidar v London Borough of EalingCase C-209/03 Bidar [2005] ECR I-2119 and Förster v Hoofddirectie van de Informatie Beheer Groep(2007) C-158/07 state that a person can be required to have lived in a country for five years prior to a claim. Facts Françoise Gravier, a French national, applied in 1982 to study cartoon drawing at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in the Belgian city of Liège. Gravier was requested to pay a fee of 24,622 Belgian francs (approximately 610 euros) as a Minerval (enrolment fee) which was only demanded from foreign students. After refusing to meet the fee, Gravier was rejected by the Académie and her Belgian study visa was revoked. Case Gravier argued that the fee breached Article 7 of the 1958 Treaty of Rome (discrimination on the grounds of nationality) and Article 59 (equality in the provision of services). Gravier took the City of Liège to the tribunal of first instance in Belgium. The court ruled that the matter concerned European Community law and that a judgment could not be produced until two points of law had been ruled on by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg. The case was tried in 1985. Judgment On 13 February 1985, the ECJ ruled that: It also ruled that learning cartoon art counted as \\"vocational training\\" and thus qualify for the same legal status. Gravier v. City of Liège is acknowledged as a precedent in European case law. The ECJ further ruled that, although higher education was outside European laws and regulations, the access to it was not. As a result, non-discriminatory access had to be applied by member states for access to professional education. With the later case in 1988, Blaizot v. University of Liège, the ECJ decreed that any education at universities can be counted as professional education.

From 2013 and through February 2016, he was a producer at STS Media. Pivovarov is currently editor-in-chief and general producer of RTVi (International Russian-Speaking Television, based in NYC), appointed in September, 2016. Pivovarov's tasks include the creation of a new news team and of an image that is attractive to advertisers. \\"We want to see not just the TV channel RTVi, but a modern media, available in on all environments [accessed by] our audience, both on air and through mobile applications and on social media,\\" said Pivovarov \\"September 2016, interview on his new position on RTVI\\" Career Pivovarov began his career in 1988 working in radio. In 2005 he became a news presenter for Evening News \\"Segodnya\\" (\\"Today\\"), usually appearing with Lilia Gildeeva, and for his own TV projects. At the beginning of his TV career, Pivovarov was a protégé of Leonid Parfyonov. In 2004-2005 when Parfyonov was fired from NTV, Pivovarov supported him with a sarcastic comment on the air, and was suspended from the Evening news as punishment.\\"Russia TV host suspended for joke\\", 9 December 2004, BBC News. Retrieved 4 January 2012. The news agency Reuters called Pivovarov \\"an unlikely opposition hero\\" after the website of the newspaper Kommersant reported that he allegedly refused to read the news on December 8, 2011 if he could not report on the ongoing protests in Moscow, which were being ignored by the state-controlled media. The next day, reports on the protests were included in the evening NTV news report, and other channels followed their example. NTV denied that Pivovarov had made any ultimatum,НТВ опровергло сообщения об ультиматуме телеведущего Lenta.ru and Pivovarov himself never confirmed the report. Filmmaking In recent years Pivovarov has written, produced and presented five docudramas about World War II: Rzhev: General Zhukov's Unknown Battle (2009); Moscow. Fall of 1941 (2010); The Captive Heroes of Brest (2010); Betrayal:The Story of Vlasov's Second Shock Army (2011); and June 22, 1941: Fateful Decisions (2011). Based on thorough research, newly released historic documents and interviews with experts and surviving witnesses, each film sheds new light on events of the recent past, deviating significantly from the version imposed by official soviet historiography. Poignant and revealing, these films depict the tragedy of war through the eyes of ordinary people, while stressing the parallels between Stalin and Hitler. All five films generated a wide response among the general public. One of the films, Rzhev: General Zhukov's Unknown Battle was awarded a special prize at the 2009 NIKA Ceremony (the Russian Oscars). In 2011 Pivovarov participated in a joint Russian-German documentary project about the events leading up to World War II, acting as producer and one of the on-screen presenters. In 2012, alongside documentary filmmakers Alexander Rastorguev and Pavel Kostomarov, Pivovarov created the documentary project “Srok” on political protests in Russia. Later, “Srok” was renamed Lenta.doc became a project on the old version of Lenta.ru, before Russia's media reforms of 2014. In 2014, the feature film Srok was assembled from the project's materials. Aviator Production Aviator Production is an independent production company launched by Pivovarov in 2009. It develops and produces documentary films, docudramas, feature films and TV shows for Russian Channels. Personal life Pivovarov is married to journalist Anna Schneider, and has a son named Ivan.

He was one of the leaders of the convention movement in New England.Easton, Hosea by Donald Yacovone, Oxford African American Studies Center. Background He was one of four sons of James Easton of North Bridgewater, originally a blacksmith, from Middleborough, Massachusetts. Background on the side of his father traces back to a group of slaves freed by Nicholas Easton and his brother Peter, on Rhode Island in the 17th century. James Easton married Sarah Dunbar, thought to be of mixed race. His ancestry was therefore probably African, Native American (Narragansett and Wampanoag), and European. Racial classifications meant little for this family, and Hosea Easton was later to write against their meaning anything intrinsic.William Cooper Nell, The Colored Patriots of the American Revolution (1855), p. 33; Google Books.James Brewer Stewart, Abolitionist Politics and the Coming of the Civil War (2008), p. 70; Google Books.John Wood Sweet, Bodies Politic: negotiating race in the American North, 1730-1830 (2003), p. 392; Google Books. James Easton became a successful businessman in ironwork and was well-connected in the Boston area. He ran a vocational school for persons of color, attached to his foundry, from about 1816 to 1830. His son Hosea participated in it, with his brother James who became a homeopathic physician.James Brewer Stewart, Abolitionist Politics and the Coming of the Civil War (2008), pp. 73-5; Google Books. Activism in Boston Easton married in 1827 and moved to Boston in 1828, where he was minister in a church in West Centre Street, Beacon Hill (from 1861 Anderson Street).Donald M. Jacobs, Courage and Conscience: Black and white abolitionists in Boston (1993), p. 167, note 13; Google Books. He joined the Massachusetts General Colored Association, set up in 1826. It had the dual aims of agitation for the abolition of slavery, and the welfare of free blacks.John Daniels, In Freedom's Birthplace; a study of the Boston Negroes (1914), p. 36; archive.org. He was one of the Boston committee set up by the convention of June 1831 in Philadelphia. It also included Samuel Snowden and Thomas Paul, the only black ministers then in Boston, Robert Roberts who had married Easton's sister Sarah as his second wife and so become brother-in- law,Robert Roberts, The House Servant's Directory, or, A monitor for private families: comprising hints on the arrangement and performance of servantsʾ work (1998 edition), p. xxiv; Google Books.Stewart, p. 80; Books. and James G. Barbadoes.Daniels, p. 46; archive.org. Robert Roberts and Easton's brother Joshua had joined with him in a previous venture, a vocational school in New Haven that would continue his father's ideas. That project had been made impossible by local racial hostility. They now united with him to oppose the American Colonization Society, who were acquiring land in what became Liberia. Some 1831 meetings in Boston on the colonization issue were reported in The Liberator, in March and May.Liberator item March 12, 1831.Liberatoritem May 28, 1831. Pastor in Hartford Easton moved to Hartford, Connecticut in 1833 with his wife Louisa and family. With local black leaders he formed the Hartford Literary and Religious Institution, and in January 1834 was appointed its agent. He then toured New England as a fundraiser, but had to cut his plans back because of racial violence.Charles William Calhoun, The Human Tradition in America from the Colonial Era through Reconstruction (2002), p. 200–1; Google Books. Easton was a preacher of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (AMEZ) which he joined in the 1830s,Henry H. Mitchell, Black Church Beginnings: the long-hidden realities of the first years (2004), p. 114; Google Books.Carter Godwin Woodson, The History of the Negro Church (c. 1921), p. 103 note; archive.org. and an influence on the young Amos Beman who was in Hartford teaching.Nathan Aaseng, African-American Religious Leaders (2003), p. 17. Easton applied to the New York AMEZ conference in 1832; it was in 1834 that he was ordained as deacon and elder, by Christopher Rush.David E. Swift, Black Prophets of Justice: Activist Clergy Before the Civil War (1989), p. 177; Google Books. The dates and details of his associations with churches are not completely clear, however. According to one source, in 1833 there was a split of the congregation in Hartford, resulting in Congregational and Methodist churches, and the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, now on Main Street, traces its history back to that year.Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, Hartford Heritage Trail page. The Metropolitan Church's official history describes an African Religious Society in Hartford in existence in 1827, owning a church on Talcott Street, and the split occurring about 1835. There resulted the Colored Congregational Church, and the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church where Easton was the first pastor. David E. Swift writes that the Talcott Street premises being shared by the Congregational and Methodist groups, Easton persuaded the Methodists to buy land of their own in Elm Street for a new church (which was at a later point identified as the AMEZ church). Hartford was singled out by Edward Strutt Abdy at this period for the virulence of racial hatred he saw. Easton's congregation were involved in the period 1834–36, culminating in the burning of the Methodist church in 1836. (The evidence points to this church though there is no conclusive local report that identifies the burned church explicitly.)George R. Price, James Brewer Stewart,To Heal the Scourge of Prejudice: the life and writings of Hosea Easton (1999), p. 45 note 27; Google Books. Works Easton published A Treatise On the Intellectual Character, and Civil and Political Condition of the Colored People of the U. States; And the Prejudice Exercised Towards Them; With A Sermon on the Duty of the Church To Them (1837). In this work Easton wrote against racial prejudice. He invoked the Declaration of Independence as free from racial discrimination;Benjamin Quarles, Black Mosaic: essays in Afro-American history and historiography (1988), p. 102; Google Books. and he challenged the assumption that slaves could be regarded as machines and lacking in morality.Michael Fellman, Antislavery Reconsidered: new perspectives on the abolitionists (1979), p. 93; Google Books. Not well received in its time, it is now considered to be a leading work articulating the African-American abolitionist view, with the 1829 Appeal of David Walker. William Cooper Nell quoted Easton at length in 1859 on the constitutional point, while speaking against the Dred Scott Decision.Dorothy Porter Wesley, Constance Porter Uzelac (editors), William Cooper Nell, Nineteenth-century African American Abolitionist, Historian, Integrationist: selected writings from 1832-1874 (2002), p. 541; Google Books. It has been argued that the book shows the influence of William Apess.Maureen Konkle, Writing Indian Nations: native intellectuals and the politics of historiography, 1827-1863 (2004), p. 104; Google Books. Easton's outlook was rather pessimistic, informed by what he perceived as a hardening of racial divisions into a polarization in the North-East of his time and experience.Jeffrey L. Pasley, Andrew Whitmore Robertson, Beyond the Founders: new approaches to the political history of the early American republic (2004), pp. 191-2; Google Books. He wrote of the racist taunts and caricatures common even in Boston.Peter P. Hinks, To Awaken My Afflicted Brethren: David Walker and the problem of antebellum slave resistance (1997), p. 82; Google Books. Further, he argued, the stereotypical denigration based on race was a matter of early indoctrination, had economic ends, and was supported by the way white clergy condoned slavery.Rita Roberts, Evangelicalism and the Politics of Reform in Northern Black Thought, 1776-1863 (2011), p. 134; Google Books. Easton argued for race as no more intrinsic than any other effect of variegation.Colin Kidd, The Forging of Races: race and scripture in the Protestant Atlantic world, 1600-2000 (2006), p. 250; Google Books. He put his case in a way not calculated to offend on all sides, but still risking having that effect. He dealt with stereotypes, attempting to sift those that were artefacts of the institution of slavery from those that represented human variability and could be attributed to God.Michael A. Morrison, The Human Tradition in Antebellum America (2000), p. 157; Google Books. Along with James Forten and William Watkins, Easton queried the \\"immediatist\\" assumptions common in white abolitionists.Stewart p. 19; Google Books. He stated that emancipated slaves would not be capable of self-improvement without help. His message was not what abolitionists, whether black and in many prominent cases escaped slaves, or white, much wanted to hear, and his reputation accordingly suffered. He is now seen as an early Afrocentrist writer,Jacob Shavit, History in Black: African-Americans in search of an ancient past (2001), p. 7; Google Books. arguing for the cultural inheritance of Ancient Greece from Ancient Egypt.Shavit, p. 275 note 28; Google Books.

Its benefice is united with those of St Margaret, Hornby, St John the Evangelist, Gressingham, and St Michael the Archangel, Whittington-in-Lonsdale. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It stands at the end of the village street, overlooking the River Lune, within the bailey of a former castle. The former 11th-century motte stands to the northeast of the church. History A church has been present on the site since about 1450, and was originally a chapel of ease in the parish of Melling. It became a parish in its own right in 1866. The church has been restored twice. It was initially a simple rectangular barn-like building. A bellcote was added in 1788, together with a vestry and a west door. It was further restored in 1899 by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley. They replaced the west door with a window, installed new pews and an east window, replaced the pulpit, enlarged the vestry, and reconstructed the porch. The former Georgian style windows were replaced with windows in Perpendicular style. The work cost over £2,000 (equivalent to £ in ). Description Precincts In the churchyard is a medieval sandstone cross base. It is roughly octagonal in shape with a diameter of about , and is about high. The cross base is listed at Grade II. Exterior St John's is constructed in sandstone rubble, and has a stone slate roof. Its plan consists of a nave with a south aisle, a chancel, a vestry, and a south porch. On the west gable is a bellcote. Also at the west end of the nave is a three-light window containing Perpendicular tracery. The west window of the aisle consists of a single trefoiled light. The east window of the chancel has four trefoiled lights, and the window at the east end of the aisle has two round-headed lights. Interior Inside the church is a four-bay arcade of round arches carried on octagonal piers. The capital of the easternmost pier is carved with images, including a dog chasing a hare, and a horn. In the chancel is a twin sedilia and a piscina. There are two fonts, one dating from the 18th century with an octagonal bowl, and the other from the early 20th century. The stained glass includes a window designed by Shrigley and Hunt dated 1965 depicting Saint Hilda and Bede. The two-manual organ was built in 1906 by the local firm of Bibby and Wolfenden, and was rebuilt in 1950 by Wilkinson. The single bell is said to be one of the oldest in England to be inscribed along its lower edge.

He was fierce politician, was ready to face anything. He would go to extreme lengths in order to achieve what he wants. One of the strongest allies of Srimavo Bandaranaike, more importantly he cared about the people. He had to relocate his supporters during an internal conflict in the area; he got them state lands and compensation from the government. He did this all keeping in mind that his voter base is being relocated, as their safety came before anything else. Which eventually led to his defeat, but he actually won. The people of that electorate are able to enjoy now what he had initiated 30 years ago. He moved from the federal party as their views were different sat as an independent MP in the parliament following election he contested as an SLFP candidate. No one would do that today. He is non communal and a nationalist. He has saved many people from the LTTE. He was one of few politicians who were allowed to go in to the LTTE controlled areas and return alive. People were always in his mind.

It is published in Pyongyang. It was started in 1945. It is the principal newspaper of the Cabinet of North Korea and the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly. History Minju Choson was founded in 1945. It began as Pyongyang Ilbo, the organ of the South Pyongan People's Committee. In October 1945, it changed its name to the current one, as it became the organ of the North Korean Provincial People's Committee, and took its current position in September 1948 when the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was officially established. Minju Choson was intended as a North Korean equivalent of the Soviet newspaper Izvestiya. In the Soviet Union, Izvestiya was more focused on economy than Pravda, which was more propagandist in content. This distinction was reflected in the North Korean papers Minju Choson and Rodong Sinmun. Since 1967 – the year of the Kapsan Faction Incident – the content of Minju Choson has been identical in tone to that of Rodong Sinmun. The newspaper launched its website in 2019. Overview Minju Choson is the official newspaper of the government of North Korea. Specifically, it is the organ of the Cabinet of North Korea and the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly. It is considered the second most authoritative newspaper in the country, after Rodong Sinmun. Unlike Rodong Sinmun, it handles more administrative matters, such as decisions and orders of the Cabinet, laws, regulations and policy issues. Content on both foreign and domestic policy, the economy, and culture is typical as well. The official mission of the newspaper is to \\"arm the workers of the people's governing bodies and the national economic bodies with the Great Leader's revolutionary thought and Juche ideology, and to greatly help the entire society in accomplishing Juche exploits by holding the workers firmly around the Party and the Great Leader and forcefully organizing and mobilizing them\\". Minju Choson is published in Pyongyang. Circulation is 200,000. The editor-in-chief is Jong Ri-jong. New Year editorials As a tradition since 1996, along with the two other main state run newspapers in North Korea and the Korean Central news agency, Rodong Minju Choson publishes a joint New Year editorial that outlines the country's policies for the year. The editorials usually offer praise for the Songun policy, the government and leadership, and encourage the growth of the nation. They are also critical of the policies of South Korea, Japan, the United States, and Western governments towards the country.North Korea issues New Year denuclearization pledge. Reuters.

The 2012 joint editorial edition, the first under Kim Jong-un's leadership, started with a great tribute to Kim Jong-il and aside from recurring calls for improving inter-Korean relations and for the fulfillment of the October 4 Declaration of 2007, also called on the whole nation to give priority to do Kim Jong-il's 2012 mission of Strong and Prosperous Nation, continue his and his father Kim Il-sung's legacies to the entire country and the socialist cause, and to build up and encourage the various sectors that compose the nation to become contributors to national progress in all areas at all costs.

In a career that lasted from 1849 to August 1852 he ran ten times and won five races. In 1850 he won The Derby and the St Leger against his fellow three- year-olds and then recorded his most famous victory when beating The Flying Dutchman in the Doncaster Cup. In May 1851 Voltigeur was beaten by The Flying Dutchman in what was probably the most celebrated match race in the history of British thoroughbred racing. Voltigeur was never as good again, winning once from his remaining five races, but went on to have a successful stud career. Background Voltigeur, described in sources as being bay, brown or even black, was bred by Robert Stephenson at his stud at Hart, near Hartlepool, County Durham. He stood high and was described as being \\"muscular\\" and \\"powerful\\" but having a rather coarse head and being rather \\"high on the leg\\". As a yearling he was sent to the sales, but was returned to his breeder after failing to attract any interest. Robert Hill, the private trainer for Lord Zetland was however, impressed by the colt and eventually persuaded the Earl to buy him the following autumn for £1,000. The sale arrangement provided for an extra £500 to be paid if the colt won the Derby. Hill took charge of training the colt at Aske, North Yorkshire. Voltigeur's sire, Voltaire was a successful racehorse who won the Doncaster Cup in 1829. He went on to become a good stallion, with his best son apart from Voltigeur being the St Leger winner Charles the Twelfth. His dam Martha Lynn went on to produce the Yorkshire Oaks winner Vivandiere and was the grandam of the 1000 Guineas winner Imperieuse. Racing career 1849: two-year-old season Voltigeur ran once as a two-year-old, appearing in the Wright Stakes at Richmond, North Yorkshire on 31 October 1849. He looked impressive in the paddock and won well, beating Mark Tapley by a length. 1850: three-year-old season Although Voltigeur did not run in the spring of 1850 he was quietly fancied for the Epsom Derby with his support being particularly strong in Yorkshire where Zetland owned large estates and among the order of Freemasons of which he was a Grand Master. Shortly before the race, Zetland discovered that the colt’s breeder had not made the correct entry payments and that it would cost £400 to run in the Derby. Zetland was determined to withdraw Voltigeur, but was persuaded to pay the entry fee after representations from his Yorkshire tenants, who explained that they had wagered heavily on the horse and faced ruin if he failed. Francis Grant Voltigeur performed poorly in an exercise gallop shortly after arriving at Epsom, and was allowed to start at odds of 16/1 in a field of twenty-four runners. The start of the race was delayed after an objection was lodged against one of the runners, Diecoon. In an echo of the \\"Running Rein\\" affair of five years' earlier, the horse was only cleared to run after a veterinary surgeon examined him and confirmed that he was a three-year-old. Ridden by Job Marson, Voltigeur was settled in seventh place in the early stages before making his challenge in the straight. Inside the final furlong (), Voltigeur took the lead ahead of the favourite Clincher and ran on strongly to win comfortably by a length. The 2000 Guineas winner Pitsford finished well to take second from Clincher in the last strides. In September, Voltigeur returned to Yorkshire for the St Leger at Doncaster. He started favourite at odds of 8/13 against seven rivals. In the early stages, he was badly hampered as the other jockeys attempted to “box” him in a \\"ruck\\" against the rails, and Marson decided to change tactics. Instead of holding the colt up for a late run, he took Voltigeur into the lead at the turn into the straight and attempted to win from the front. In the closing stages Voltigeur began to tire and was caught in the last strides by Russborough, despite being hard ridden by Marson who had to use his spurs on the favourite. The judge declared a dead-heat, and with the owners of the colts failing to reach an agreement to divide the stakes, the two colts had to race again over the same course later that afternoon. Hill had planned to rest Voltigeur in his stable before the rematch but was advised by John Scott that if he did so he \\"might as well shoot him through the head\\" as he would stiffen up. Hill therefore kept Voltigeur walking round until he was called out for the deciding heat. At the second attempt, Marson was able to ride a waiting race on Voltigeur, tracking Russborough before moving ahead inside the final furlong to win \\"cleverly\\" by a length. The win, described by the Liverpool Albion as \\"one of the most memorable on record\\", provoked scenes of enthusiastic and prolonged celebrations by the Yorkshire crowd. Having run almost in the course of the afternoon, Voltigeur appeared the following day, and walked over to take the prize money in the Scarborough Stakes, when no other horses opposed him. Despite his exertions, he turned out two days later for the Doncaster Cup in which he was the only horse to oppose The Flying Dutchman, the winner of the 1849 Derby and St Leger and undefeated in thirteen career starts. The Flying Dutchman, whose jockey appeared to be the worse for drink, set off at an exceptionally fast pace and Marson was able to bide his time on Voltigeur. In the straight Voltigeur moved up alongside the four-year- old champion and then pulled ahead to win by half a length in a huge upset. The race inspired a poem from \\"The Druid\\" (W. H. Dixon), which was printed in Bell's Life and culminated with the stanza: :The ring stands pale. Forth speeds the tale, which many a doubt inspires :From east to west, from north to south, it glances o'er the wires. :From Richmond unto Middleham this message quickly passed :Your conqueror of conquerors has bowed his head at last. After the race it was agreed that the two horses would meet again in a match race at York the following spring for a prize of 2,000 guineas, with each owner putting up half the sum. 1851: four-year-old season The Great Match by J F Herring: \\"Volti\\" is beaten by \\"The Flyer\\" The two-mile race (3.2 km) was held as part of a renewed spring meeting at York on 13 May 1851. The weights for the match were set by Henry John Rous, who decided that The Flying Dutchman should carry to Voltigeur's . The race between the two Yorkshire- trained horses generated enormous public interest among all classes of society, even among those who normally took no interest in horse racing. The match drew an estimated 100,000 spectators, the largest crowd to the Knavesmire since the execution of Eugene Aram in 1759. According to a lengthy analysis of the race published in Bell's Life, previous great matches, such as the one at Newmarket between Hambletonian and Diamond in 1799, \\"fell into insignificance\\" in comparison with the York event. Even the horses' exercise gallops attracted large crowds of fans attempting to assess their relative condition. On the day of the race, the crowd was divided into partisan camps, cheering for either \\"Volti\\" or \\"The Flyer\\". Ridden by Nat Flatman, Voltigeur made the running, but although he held the lead into the straight, he was unable to dispose of his rival. In the final furlong, the Flatman dropped his whip, and The Flying Dutchman moved up level and then pulled ahead to win by a length. The painting of the finish of the match by John F. Herring (right) became one of the most widely reproduced images of the time with \\"scarcely a village\\" in the British Empire being without at least one copy. One day after his defeat, Voltigeur turned out for the York and Ainsty Hunt Cup over two miles (3.2 km), in which he was surprisingly beaten by a three-year-old filly named Nancy. 1852: five-year-old season Voltigeur was successful on his five-year-old debut on 20 April when he carried top weight of to victory a race at York named \\"The Flying Dutchman Handicap\\", proving himself \\"very game\\" by staying on under extreme pressure to win by a head. He started 7/4 favourite but finished only fifth at Ascot, behind Joe Miller in the Emperor of Russia's Plate, where he appeared less than fully fit and was unsuited by the soft, muddy ground. In the Ebor Handicap at York in August, he again carried top weight but was eased down when beaten and finished eighth behind Adine, a filly to whom he was conceding forty-six pounds. Despite looking leg- weary, he was sent out again later that same afternoon for Country Plate, a five-furlong () sprint race, in what The Sportsman described as a \\"strange\\" decision. He finished last of the five runners and never ran again. Assessment and honours In May 1886 The Sporting Times carried out a poll of one hundred experts to create a ranking of the best British racehorses of the 19th century. Voltigeur was ranked thirtieth, having been placed in the top ten by eight of the contributors. He was the sixth-highest placed horse to have raced before 1850. On Voltigeur's death in 1874 the Sheffield Telegraph called him \\"the pride of the Yorkshire sportsman, and one of the best and most popular horses that ever trod the British turf.\\" The stable block at Aske Hall, where Voltigeur spent his last years When the racecourse authorities at York instituted a new trial race for the St Leger in 1950, the race was named the \\"Great Voltigeur Stakes\\" in his honour. Voltigeur was the only racehorse painted by the famous animal painter Edwin Henry Landseer. Landseer's interest was reportedly engaged when he heard that Voltigeur was constantly accompanied by a tortoiseshell cat who slept on the horse's back. Stud career Voltigeur initially stood as a stallion at Middlethorpe near York at a fee of 15 guineas. Voltigeur’s most notable offspring was the 2000 Guineas winner Vedette, from his first crop of foals, who sired the Derby winner Galopin among other winners. Galopin sired the undefeated champion St. Simon who became the dominant British stallion of his era. At the age of twenty-seven Voltigeur sustained a fractured hind leg when he was kicked by a mare named Time Test. He was shot on 21 February 1874, and buried in the grounds of Aske Hall.

Asan Gunla Bajan players Tebaha Gunla Bajan players Gunlā Bājan () is devotional music played by the Newars of Nepal. Page 111. \\"Gunla\\" is the name of the tenth month in the Nepal Sambat calendar, which corresponds to August in the Gregorian calendar and \\"bajan\\" means \\"music\\" and \\"music playing group\\". Page 328. Gunla is a holy month for Newa Buddhists when they recite the scriptures and visit places of worship playing devotional music. The practice of observing the sacred month is descended from the rains retreat dating from the Buddha's time when monks stayed in one place and taught the Dharma.LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005) Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal. Harvard University Press. . Page 64. Retrieved 5 January 2012. Performances Societies based on locality or caste, in which membership is hereditary, organize Gunla Bajan performances. These groups follow an annual calendar of public performances. They also conduct music lessons and hold religious festivals, hymn singing sessions and feasts. The most important activity of the year is making daily pilgrimages during Gunla to Swayambhu and other Buddhist sites playing Gunla music. The main days during the holy month are Bahidyah Swahwanegu (बहीद्यः स्वःवनेगु), when devotees playing Gunla music visit sacred courtyards to view the images of Bahidyah (Dipankara Buddha) and paubha paintings put on display for the festival;Locke, John Kerr (1985) Buddhist Monasteries of Nepal: A Survey of the Bahas and Bahis of the Kathmandu Valley. Kathmandu: Sahayogi Press. Page 408. and Nisala Chhawanegu (निसला छा:वनेगु), when offerings are made to Swayambhu and concerts are held at one's neighborhoods. Gunla musical bands also lead processions during New Year's Day of Nepal Sambat. Music A performance of Gunla music Page 415. starts with Dyah Lhayegu, a short salutation to the deities. Separate pieces of music are played when marching in procession, going around a shrine and crossing a bridge. These are known as Lawantah, Chwoh, Graha, Astar, Palimaa and Partaal. During processions, musicians usually play the tunes of seasonal songs or other traditional songs backed by drums and cymbals. Tunes of modern hits are also played. Gwara is a long piece of music which is played in temple squares and sacred courtyards with the musicians standing in a circle. It is 15 to 20 minutes long. The popular ones are Annapurna Gwara, Swetkali Gwara and Sangin Gwara. Instruments The double-sided drum known as \\"dhaa\\" (धा:), which is the main instrument in Gunla music, is believed to have been played in the Kathmandu Valley for 2,000 years. It is struck on the left side with a short stick and on the right side with the hand. Trumpets and clarinets are used to play the tune. Originally, local wind instruments known as \\"mwahali\\" (म्वाहालि) and \\"basuri\\" (बासुरि) provided the tune. The other instruments used are \\"taa\\" (ता:) and \\"bhusya\\" (भुस्या:), small and large cymbals respectively. The \\"naykhin\\" (नायखिं) small drum and \\"chhusya\\" (छुस्या:) cymbals form a separate set of instruments. The \\"payentah\\" (पंयता:) is a long trumpet. Page 328.

While in Pakistan they have settled in Karachi. They are a sub-group within the larger Faqir ethnic group of North India, and are also known as Peerahi, while in Punjab, they are known as Bharai. The Bharai were traditionally priests of the Sultani sect, a syncretic sect with combined elements of Hinduism and Islam. The Sultanis were followers of the Sufi saint Sultan Sakhi Sarwar of Dera Ghazi Khan in what is now Pakistan. Most Sultanis were members of the Hindu Jat community, but the Bharai were always Muslim, and belonged either to the Muslim Jat or Muslim Rajput castes. The Jat Bharai in the central Punjab claim descent from one Garba Jat, a Hindu attendant at the shrine of Sakhi Sarwar, who said to have been instructed by Sakhi Sarwar to convert to Islam in a dream. There are various theories as to the origin of the word Bharai. Horace Rose, the early 20th-century ethnologist of the Punjab made castes such as the Dogar, Habri, Rajput,Gujar, Tarkhan and last, but not least, Jat joining the Bharai brotherhood. Like other Faqir groups, the Sarwari started off as a Sufi order, the Sarwari Qadiriyya. The word sarvar means ‘leader’, ‘chief’, and ‘master’ in the Persian language, and the Sarwari order was said to be founded by Sultan Bahoo, the famous Sufi of Punjab.Abun- Nasr, Jamil M. \\"The Special Sufi Paths (Taqiras).\\" Muslim Communities of Grace: The Sufi Brotherhoods in Islamic Religious Life. New York: Columbia UP, 2007. 86-96. Over the time, the Sarwaris have evolved into a distinct caste grouping, bound by the rules of endogamy. They are attendants of sakhi sarwar and thats their occupation. In terms of distribution, they are concentrated in the western districts of Uttar Pradesh such as Moradabad, Jyotiba Phule Nagar, Bijnor, Rampur and Bareilly. The Sarwari live in multi-caste villages, but occupy their own distinct quarters. They speak both Urdu and the Khari Boli dialect, and are entirely Sunni..

Under its subsidiaries iFrogz, mophie, Braven, Gear4 and HALO, the company distributes accessories such as chargers, battery packs, protective cases and audio accessories.  History  The line of screen protection by ZAGG that is under the InvisibleShield brand, was created by Phillip Chipping, who then formed Protective Solutions, Inc. in March 2005. The brand started selling the InvisibleShield product online, and in locally owned gadget retailers. The company began in a back yard shed, selling $200 worth of goods per day. In January 2006, Chipping brought in Robert G. Pedersen II, a friend and mentor who previously acted in an advisory capacity, as a partner with the title of CEO, while Chipping retained the title of president and founder. Later that year, after buying out Chipping, Pedersen became the largest shareholder. In 2010, he was also named Ernst & Young's Entrepreneur of the Year.http://utahpulse.com/featured_article/zagg-ceo-robert-g-pedersen-ii- named-ernst-young’s-2010-entrepreneur-of-the-year The company changed names to become ShieldZone Corporation in March 2006 and then again to ZAGG Inc in July 2007. The most recent name change coincided with a reverse merger that made ZAGG a publicly traded company on the OTC Bulletin Board exchange with ZAGG as its stock symbol. On November 10, 2009; it was listed on the NASDAQ Market. In August 2012, Pedersen stepped down as CEO and Chairman following a margin call, and Randall Hales, previously President and COO, became interim CEO. In December 2012, Hales was named CEO by the Board of Directors. In March 2018, Randall Hales who served since 2012 as CEO of ZAGG resigned. At his resignation, the Board of Directors appointed Chris Ahern to be the CEO. Ahern formerly was serving as the head of the Mophie brand and international business. In 2020, ZAGG was a recipient of a loan of US$ 9.4 million as part of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The allocation of loans to publicly traded companies such as ZAGG caused criticism of the program, and allegations that funds were misallocated by the federal government. On April 23, 2020 the US Treasury announced that the eligibility criteria for PPP had been updated to be less inclusive of publicly traded companies. ZAGG released a statement that it would not be returning its loans, stating that “With extensive retail closures nationwide, our business has been severely impacted during the shutdown of all non-essential businesses due to COVID-19. We are using the money in accordance with government guidelines.”  Acquisitions and subsidiaries  The company sells protective cases for devices such as smartphones, tablets and Apple Watches under the InvisibleShield brand. The company also manufactures keyboards under the ZAGG brand name for mobile devices such as iPads and tablets.

In November of that year ZAGG acquired smartphone case manufacturer Gear4 for $40 million. In January 2019 ZAGG acquired HALO for $43 million. HALO manufactures wireless charging accessories such as car and wall chargers, portable power, and power wallets.  Financials  ZAGG Inc is traded on the NASDAQ. ZAGG currently has over 500 employees and is in the Specialty Retail industry and Consumer Cyclical sector. Zagg inc (ZAGG.O), a maker of screen protectors for mobile devices, said on Friday it plans to keep a $9.5 million loan granted under Treasury's Payroll Protection Program (PPP), a day after new guidance that publicly traded firms would have a hard time proving they really needed the coronavirus relief funds. \\"These funds will play a critical role in ensuring we have our team in place as the economy reopens,\\" a spokesman for Zagg said in an emailed statement. U.S. companies on Thursday began refusing government loans they were just awarded, after the Treasury Department updated its guidance.Zagg has also furloughed 20% off the company to comply with the loan. COVID-19 Response The Company and its Board of Directors have taken the following proactive measures to provide enhanced financial flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic: Closed on amendment to its secured revolving credit facility to increase available borrowings by $19.8 million through March 2021. Closed on a small business administration loan under the CARES Act of approximately $9.4 million that is expected to fund in the next five business days.

Fish head curry A Cheese Naan Maggi goreng Biryani Malaysian Indian cuisine, or the cooking of the ethnic Indian communities in Malaysia consists of adaptations of authentic dishes from India, as well as original creations inspired by the diverse food culture of Malaysia. Because the vast majority of Malaysia's Indian community are of South Indian descent, and are mostly ethnic Tamils who are descendants of immigrants from a historical region which consists of the modern Indian state of Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka's Northern Province, much of Malaysian Indian cuisine is predominantly South Indian inspired in character and taste. A typical Malaysian Indian dish is likely to be redolent with curry leaves, whole and powdered spice, and contains fresh coconut in various forms. Ghee is still widely used for cooking, although vegetable oils and refined palm oils are now commonplace in home kitchens. Before a meal it is customary to wash hands as cutlery is often not used while eating, with the exception of a serving spoon for each respective dish. Cuisine Culture Banana Leaf As nearly 90% of Malaysian Indians originated from South India, banana leaf is used traditionally to eat food from. The banana leaf meal is famous in Malaysia. With rice at the center and different accompaniments like pickle, fried meat or vegetable, papadam (Indian fries made of lentils), it's a feast by itself and various curries that are served around this is not just a treat for the eyes but also to the palate.http://blog.tourism.gov.my/banana-leaf-rice/ Etiquette is important when it comes to a banana leaf rice meal. One part involves the practice of serving, namely the way the leaf is placed before a diner and where the food is placed on the leaf itself. Eating with your hands is a must The folding aspect of the banana leaf is also contentious with many believing it to be a rating system – fold towards you if you're satisfied and fold away if you're not. Chettinad cuisine Chettinad cuisine, the cuisine of the Chettinad region in Tamil Nadu, is very popular and available at specialist restaurants. The traditional cookery of the Chettiar community is distinct from the predominantly vegetarian fare of Tamil cuisine as it is heavily based on robustly spiced meat preparations. Coconut milk is sparingly used in favour of liberal quantities of onions and tomatoes to flavour and thicken curries. Mamak culture Mamak (Indian Muslims) dishes have developed a distinctly Malaysian style. Available throughout the country, the omnipresent Mamak stalls or restaurants are particularly popular among the locals as they offer a wide range of food and some outlets are open 24 hours a day. A type of Indian Muslim meal served buffet-style at specialist Mamak eateries is called nasi kandar (analogous to the Indonesian nasi padang, where you pay for what you have actually eaten), white rice or briyani rice served with other dishes of curry either with chicken, fish, beef, or mutton, and usually accompanied with pickled vegetables and papadum. People of all races, religions and ages frequent mamak stalls to gossip or catch a late-night football game while enjoying a cup of hot teh tarik.

The screenplay was written by Stewart Harcourt, produced by Laurie Borg and directed by Steve Barron. It was made by BSkyB and first shown in the United Kingdom on Sky1 on 1 & 2 January 2012. Plot Young Jim Hawkins (Toby Regbo) discovers a map to a legendary island of treasure belonging to the infamous Captain Flint (Donald Sutherland) and embarks on a journey aboard the ship Hispaniola to find it; however, the enigmatic Long John Silver (Eddie Izzard) and crew have other plans. Cast * Eddie Izzard as Long John Silver, formerly Captain Flint's quartermaster and latterly landlord of the Spyglass Inn, cook on the Hispaniola, and leader of the mutineers. In this adaptation he loses his leg after Flint fires a cannon at his crew to get them off the ship. * Philip Glenister as Captain Smollett, captain of the Hispaniola * Rupert Penry-Jones as Squire John Trelawney, the leader of the expedition, a greedy, stupid man who betrays his comrades. Rather different from his portrayal in the book, in which he is something of a buffoon but is described as \\"the most liberal of men\\". * Toby Regbo as Jim Hawkins, son of the proprietors of the Admiral Benbow inn and the Hispaniola's cabin boy * Daniel Mays as Dr David Livesey, the ship's doctor, an old friend of Jim's parents. A former army surgeon who fought at Fontenoy, in the book he is always sensible and brave, but in this adaptation is initially something of a coward (though he later proves to be quite brave). * Reda Kateb as Dujon, the second mate of the Hispaniola. Dujon was invented for this adaptation. * Donald Sutherland as Captain Flint, a legendary pirate. Flint does not appear in the book, but is only spoken of. In this adaptation he appears in a prologue. * Elijah Wood as Ben Gunn, a former member of Flint's crew marooned on Treasure Island three years before after he persuaded his crewmates on another ship to search for the treasure. When they could not find it they left him there. In this adaptation he is portrayed as a Yankee, although this is not specified in the book. * David Harewood as Billy Bones, formerly Flint's first mate, who precipitates the whole adventure by dying in the Admiral Benbow inn. In this adaptation he is portrayed as Jamaican. * Julian Barratt as Redruth. In the book, Tom Redruth was Trelawney's elderly gamekeeper and accompanied the expedition to Treasure Island, where he was killed. In this adaptation, he is Trelawney's ruthless agent; he remains in England, where he repossesses the Admiral Benbow from Meg Hawkins. * Shirley Henderson as Meg Hawkins, Jim Hawkins' mother, recently widowed landlady of the Admiral Benbow inn. Her first name is not given in the book. * Nina Sosanya as Alibe Silver, Silver's wife, who flees to the Admiral Benbow to get away from Black Dog and befriends Meg Hawkins. The character has essentially been invented for this adaptation, although the book does state that Silver has an (unseen) wife, a \\"woman of colour\\" whom he leaves in charge of his inn. * Geoff Bell as Israel Hands, formerly Captain Flint's gunner, later a crewman on the Hispaniola and one of the leaders of the mutineers. In the book he serves as the Hispaniola's coxswain and is described as a good seaman, but in this adaptation this role has been taken over by Abraham Gray and Silver says that Hands is a poor seaman (although a good gunner). * Shaun Parkes as George Merry, a former member of Flint's crew and boatswain (and later mate) of the Hispaniola and a mutineer. In the book he is a simple crewman (although also a former member of Flint's crew) and leads the discontent against Silver's leadership. * Keith Allen as Blind Pew, a former member of Flint's crew, now a blind beggar * Sean Gilder as Black Dog, a former member of Flint's crew * Barnaby Kay as Tom Morgan, a former member of Flint's crew and later of Hispaniola's and a mutineer. He is described in the book, in which he was also a member of Flint's crew, as elderly and \\"mahogany- faced\\" (although it is not specified whether this means he is heavily tanned or black). * Clinton Blake as Freddie Arrow, the Hispaniola's first mate. In the book he is the only mate, an appalling officer who disappears one night (presumably fallen overboard while drunk), but in this adaptation (in which he is portrayed as Jamaican) he dies after being keel-hauled by Trelawney after striking him (also while drunk). He is not given a first name in the book. * Tom Fisher as Abraham Gray, the Hispaniola's coxswain and the only survivor among the seamen who refuse to join the mutineers. In the book, Gray (the carpenter's mate, not the coxswain, as Hands holds that position) initially joins the mutineers, but then defects after Captain Smollett appeals to his better nature. * Madhur Mittal as Dick Johnson, a young former member of Flint's crew and later a crewman on the Hispaniola and one of the mutineers. In the book, Johnson is the youngest hand on the Hispaniola and is persuaded to join the mutiny by Silver. He is not a former member of Flint's crew. * David Wilmot as William O'Brien, one of the mutineers. His first name is not given in the book. * Chu Omambala as Job Anderson, one of Flint's crew who later serves on the Hispaniola. In the book he is the ship's boatswain and effectively takes over as mate after Arrow disappears, but in this adaptation this role has been taken over by George Merry. The book does not say whether or not he was a member of Flint's crew. * Lorenzo Grozco as Allardyce, one of Flint's crew who helps him bury his treasure and whose skeleton is later used as a pointer by Flint. * Alfredo Salgado as Jeremiah Darby, one of Flint's crew who helps him bury his treasure. He is not named in the book. * Ruaidhri Conroy as John Hunter, one of Trelawney's servants, who accompanies the expedition and is killed on Treasure Island. * Mal Whyte as Richard Joyce, Trelawney's valet, who accompanies the expedition and is killed on Treasure Island. * Tom Wu as Joe Thoby, a Chinese seaman on the Hispaniola who refuses to join the mutiny, whereupon Silver kills him. In the book this is a man named Tom, an old friend of Silver's. * Damien Hannaway as Alan Tab, a crewman of the Hispaniola killed by the mutineers after he refuses to join them. His surname is not given in the book. * Siobhan O'Kelly as Mrs Livesey, now deceased and only appearing in flashback * Tommy O'Neill as Salt Reception The series was moderately well received by critics, with praise towards its production values and cast, but some criticism leveled at the direction and changes to the original story. Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote, \\"They've changed it, not just unnecessarily but unquestionably for the worse, and that's a travesty. Robert Louis Stevenson, Captain Flint, Davy Jones, will be turning in their graves/lockers.\\" Rachel Ward of The Telegraph, however, called it \\"an imaginitive take\\", said \\"Izzard excels as both villain and hero, and brings his trademark humour to the role ('Let’s parle'), though it would have been nice to hear a few more squawks from his pet parrot\\", and praised the action.

It is the first independent rating platform mainly based on community's contributions to feed data and information to establish independent, impartial and transparent ratings. History Development of the platform started in spring 2010 by Austrian mathematician Dorian Credé and his colleague Erwan Salembier. The platform, which is based on the MediaWiki framework, went online in October 2011. By the end of 2011, around 2100 users had contributed ratings. In February 2012 Salembier left Wikirating, and in November 2012 the US not-for-profit rating provider Public Sector Credit Solutions published its open-source framework on the platform. Rating scheme Wikirating uses a similar rating scheme as traditional credit rating agencies, ranging from \\"AAA\\" (highest rating) to \\"D\\" (default). Rating methods The platform offers three rating methods. Public Sector Credit Framework Poll method Wikirating users can vote on the rating of each country or company. Voting is limited to one vote each to prevent manipulation. Sovereign Wikirating Index The Sovereign Wikirating Index (SWI) contains a transparent formula that takes into account various factors, believed to influence the creditworthiness of nations. As of October 2013, the SWI contains the following five criteria (with weights): *Public debt (in % of the GDP) — 50% weight *Account balance (in % of the GDP) — 20% weight *GDP growth rate — 10% weight *Inflation rate — 10% weight *Unemployment rate — 10% weight The resulting value is adjusted by multiplying it with a \\"scaling factor\\", which is composed by the Human Development Index (HDI)Human Development Report 2010 (60% weight) and the Corruption Perceptions IndexCorruption Perceptions Index 2010 (40% weight). ;Calculations Each criterium is calibrated with respect to the relative minimum and maximum value of all countries. For all criteria, a threshold value is defined in order to avoid distorted values. The calculated values are done with a spreadsheet.See http://www.wikirating.org/wiki/Rating_Method_Sovereign_Wikirating_Index_(SWI) The founders hope to engage the community to further improve the formula in order to provide optimal ratings.

Opened in 1892, the tramway has waxed and waned over the years. Currently, it comprises only one long interurban line, which runs via Auvernier and Colombier to Boudry, and is designated as line 5. All of the system's urban tram lines were converted to trolleybuses, the last such closure and conversion taking place in 1976, leaving just interurban line 5 (present line 215). The tramway is currently operated by Transports publics Neuchâtelois (formerly Compagnie des Tramways de Neuchâtel) (TN), which also runs three funiculars, the Neuchâtel trolleybus system and various conventional bus lines. History  Interurban line  The line to Boudry, including an Areuse-to-Cortaillod branch line long,Vogt, H.

Bielefeld, Germany: Werner Stock. was opened on 16 September 1892 by the former company Régional Neuchâtel-Boudry Cortaillod (NCB). It was originally a steam tramway, until in 1902 it was electrified at 600 volts DC. The branch line to Cortaillod was permanently converted to bus operation on 2 June 1984, and is now served by line 5b. Since its modernisation in the early 1980s, the line to Boudry has mostly been called Littorail. This expression is a composition of the word Littoral (French for coast in general, or for the coastal region of Lake Neuchâtel in particular) and rail (French for rail). The modernisation included equipping the line with automatic block signalling. Today, trams run to Boudry at rigid 20-minute intervals and serve a total of twelve stops. The average distance between stops is . The line to Boudry is mostly single-track, and runs on its own right-of-way, independently of road traffic. In similar fashion to a classic railway, it is controlled by automatic block signalling, as previously noted, and equipped with push button interlocking. The line is operated with bi- directional vehicles, and the travel time is either 16 or 18 minutes, depending upon the direction of travel. A route 5 tram set composed of 1902-built cars leaving the former Place Pury turning loop, in 1979. The trams of this type were in service for nearly 80 years. Until early 1988, the line's Neuchâtel terminus was a loop through the centre of Place Pury. The loop was abandoned at that time,Modern Tramway and Light Rail Transit, November 1988 issue, p. 398.

It is located about west of Place Pury, but is still referred to by TN as Neuchâtel Place Pury terminus. The now one-line system has two carhouses (or depots) for maintenance and housing of the fleet. One is at Boudry terminus, and the other is in Neuchâtel, called Evole depot and located along line 5, about west of the Place Pury terminus. The current Boudry carhouse was built in 1985,Wansbeek, C. J. (December 2005). \\"Neuchâtel: Swiss lakeside city with tram-train ambitions\\". Tramways & Urban Transit, pp. 476–479.

Urban lines  Trams at Evole depot in Neuchâtel in 1976 The first urban tramway in Neuchâtel, to Saint-Blaise, went into operation on 16 September 1893, and was originally powered by gas. For this first line, the Tramway Neuchâtel–Saint-Blaise (NSB) was responsible. On 22 December 1894, due to technical problems with the gas-engined vehicles, the line was converted into a horsecar line (). For the horsecar operations, the NSB procured six small lightweight trams, each of which was hauled by one horse. In 1897, the first urban line was finally electrified. The following year, a Port–Gare (railway station) line was opened. In subsequent years, the first two urban lines were joined by the following lines: * 1899: Place Pury–Serrières * 1901: Place-Pury–Vauseyon * 1902: Peseux–Corcelles Meanwhile, in 1901, the NSB merged with the NCB to form the Compagnie des Tramways de Neuchâtel. A tram set on route 3, the last urban route, in May 1976 The city's tramway network was subsequently expanded further, and in 1926 reached its maximum route length of . Up to six urban lines were in operation at any one time. They were numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7, and most started at Place Pury, in the city centre. Line 4 included interurban service to Cernier. Between 1940 and 1976, the urban tram lines were progressively replaced by trolleybus lines, which kept the same numbers. First to close was line 2, to Serrieres, in 1940. Line 4 to Valangin followed in 1949, line 1 to St. Blaise in 1957, and lines 6 and 7 to Neuchâtel railway station (Gare CFF) and La Coudre, respectively, in 1964.Roggenkamp, Helmut (January 1978). \\"85 Jahre Straßenbahn in Neuchâtel\\" (85 Years of the Neuchatel Tramway) (in German). Strassenbahn International, pp. 16–18. Vienna: Spurkranz Verlag. The final urban tram line to close was line 3, from Place Pury to Corcelles. Its final day as a tram service was 11 July 1976.Modern Tramway and Rapid Transit Review, November 1976 issue, p. 394. UK: Ian Allan Publishing/Light Rail Transit Association.  Fleet   Past fleet  1947-built Swiss Standard tram 83 with Lake Neuchâtel Two ex-Genoa articulated trams passing on route 5 The interurban line to Boudry always had a separate fleet from the urban fleet, but one small group of trams began service on the urban system and later moved to the interurban line after closure of the last urban line (3). These were cars 81–83, built in 1947 by Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG) and purchased new by TN. These four-axle cars were the only double-ended (bi- directional) Swiss Standard trams ever built. They were originally purchased for use on line 1, but were later used on line 3. All other trams used on the urban lines were two-axle cars and trailers, most commonly operated in sets of one powered tram and one trailer. They were built between 1892 and 1931. The last two-axle cars were retired from service when line 3 closed, in 1976. Four-axle cars 81–83 of 1947 remained in service, running on line 5. They were renumbered 581–583 in 1980. For the interurban line, the original fleet consisted of five steam locomotives, nos. 1–3 built in 1892 and 4–5 built in 1895 and 1898. They hauled passenger trailers of two or four axles. Locomotives 2, 3 and 5 remained in the fleet until 1903. For the introduction of electric tram service on line 5 in 1902, TN acquired seven double-ended, double-truck (four-axle) tramcars and four matching trailers. All were built in 1902 by SWS, the motored cars being numbered 41–47 and the trailers 51–54; the latter were renumbered 121–124 in 1911. The 1902 cars remained in service for almost 80 years. In 1967–68, they were joined by four articulated trams acquired secondhand from Genoa, Italy. Built in 1942 by Breda, these had carried numbers 1101–1104 in the Genoa tram system's fleet, and they kept the same numbers in Neuchâtel until 1980. They were the only articulated trams ever included in the fleet, and were used exclusively on line 5. Except for the soon-to-be-retired 1902 cars, the tram fleet was renumbered into the 500 series in 1980. The ex-Genoa Breda cars 1101–1104 became numbers 591–594. After the arrival of the new cars in 1981 (see below), Swiss Standard cars 581–583 were relegated to evening service, as were the ex-Genoa cars on the main line to Boudry. However, the latter were in all-day service on the Cortaillod branch, which became operated as a shuttle service to/from Areuse only (on the main Neuchâtel–Boudry line), needing only one car at a time. After closure of the Cortaillod branch in 1984, the ex-Genoa articulated cars and the Swiss Standard cars were seldom needed for service, but remained available. They were withdrawn permanently after TN acquired two additional new cars in 1988.  Current fleet  Control trailer 552 and motor tram 504 in service in 2010 The Neuchâtel tramway currently has an exclusively high- floor tram fleet, mostly built in 1981, comprising six four-axle power cars of type Be 4/4 with the numbers 501–506 and four corresponding, externally identical control cars (Bt) with the numbers 551–554. These two vehicle types are derived from the Tram 2000 vehicles of the Forchbahn. All were built by SWS in 1981, except the last two powered cars, 505–506, which were built in 1988 and had bodies built by Schindler Waggon (DE) (to the same style as cars 501–504) and trucks by SIG. The eight 1981 cars entered service on 29 June 1981,Modern Tramway and Light Rail Transit, October 1981 issue, p. 382. replacing all of the surviving 1902 cars, which were permanently withdrawn at that time. Preserved cars The former Neuchâtel heritage tram Ce 2/2 No. 76, on the Blonay–Chamby Museum Railway, 2011. TN has preserved the following cars (as of 2000): * Two-axle tram 73, built in 1922 by SIG * Two-axle trailer 143, built in 1897 by SIG, rebuilt in 1914 and 1954 * Two-axle trailer 1, ex-101 (II), ex-105, built in 1894 by SIG Elsewhere, the Blonay–Chamby museum railway has preserved Neuchâtel cars 76 (two-axle tram, built in 1922 by SIG) and 121 (four-axle trailer, built in 1892 by Maschinenfabrik Burkhard, Basel). A large number of ex-Neuchâtel trams have been preserved in various other collections. These include 1902 four-axle cars 41 and 43–47; 1920s-built two- axle cars 72, 74 and 78; 1947-built Swiss Standard Trams 582–583; and ten trailers dating from 1892–1902. None of the 1942 ex-Genoa articulated trams survives. Car 592, ex-1102, was initially preserved by the Association Neuchâteloise des Amis du Tramway (ANAT), which group also owns some of the aforementioned other trams, but was scrapped in 1993 due to its poor condition. All three others of the class had already been scrapped by 1988.

His photographic work documenting the 1871 Paris Commune is considered an important early example of photojournalism.Chrystel Jubien, \\"Braquehais Reporter , Musée d'art et d'histoire de Saint-Denis website.

While largely forgotten after his death, his work was rediscovered during preparations for the Commune's centennial in 1971, and his photographs have since been the exhibited at numerous museums, including the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire, the Musée d'Orsay, and the Carnavalet Museum. Life Braquehais was born in Dieppe, Seine-Maritime, in 1823. Deaf from a young age, he attended the Institut royal des sourds et muets (Royal Institute of the Deaf and Mute) in Paris. He worked as a lithographer in Caen until 1850, when he met photographer Alexis Gouin (ca. 1790s–1855), and moved to Paris to work in Gouin's studio. Gouin specialized in colored daguerreotypes (they were colored by his stepdaughter, Laure) and stereoscopic plates. Stereoscopic plate of a reclining female nude, taken by Braquehais ca. 1856 In 1852, Braquehais opened his own studio on the rue de Richelieu in Paris, where he produced images of female nudes. Following the death of Gouin in 1855, he managed Gouin's studio with Gouin's widow and stepdaughter (he married Gouin's stepdaughter, but sources are unclear whether it was before or after Gouin's death). In 1863, after the death of Gouin's widow, Braquehais opened a new studio, Paris Photography, on the Boulevard des Italiens. Braquehais's work was exhibited at the Société française de photographie in 1864 and at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1867. In March 1871, a group of disenchanted soldiers, workers, and professionals seized control of Paris and set up a government known as the Paris Commune. This was one of the first major events in France to be \\"covered\\" by photographers. While many of these photographers focused on the ruins and destruction in the aftermath of the fall of the Commune, Braquehais ventured out of his studio at the height of the Commune's power, photographing its participants and events, most notably the toppling of the Vendôme Column. Braquehais published 109 of his photographs in a booklet, Paris During the Commune. After the fall of the Commune, government authorities used Braquehais's photos to track down and arrest the Commune's supporters.Mary Warner Marien, Photography: A Cultural History (London: Laurence King Publishing, 2001), p. 115. In the years after the Paris Commune, Braquehais struggled financially, though he did do photographic advertising work for a clock company. By early 1874, he was bankrupt, and was jailed for 13 months for loss of confidence. He died in February 1875, a few days after his release. Works Communards pose with the toppled statue of Napoleon following the destruction of the Vendôme Column on May 8, 1871 Braquehais's early photographs consist primarily of portraits and female nudes,BRUNO BRAQUEHAIS (1823-1875) .

Art critics have pointed out that many of Braquehais's photographs of female nudes are cluttered with distracting objects (e.g., the Venus de Milo), giving the model the appearance of being isolated. Notable portraits by Braquehais include composer Ludwig Minkus and choreographer Arthur Saint-Léon. Braquehais's 109 photographs of the Paris Commune document the Commune at its height and after its fall. His photographs documenting the toppling of the Vendôme Column include scenes of the Column before its fall, a scene showing workers with ropes tied to the column ready to pull it down, and a photograph of Communards posing next to the toppled statue of Napoleon that had graced the top of the column. Braquehais also took numerous photographs of the various barricades the Communards had erected in anticipation of an invasion of republican forces, troops gathered at Tuileries Palace and Porte Maillot, and the ruins of the Maison Thiers. Braquehais's photographs have been exhibited by the Musée d'Orsay, the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire at St. Denis, the Carnavalet Museum, and the Budapest Museum, and are included in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Bibliothèque Nationale, and the Bibliothèque historique de la ville de Paris.

He then spent a year in London at the Alhambra Theatre, where he met and married the singer Emma Davies. Saracco left London in 1886 in order to become the ballet master at Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels, a position he held until 1888. Afterwards, he spent 4 months at the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma in Rome, after which he returned to Brussels in March 1889. He then started travelling between Milan, Monte-Carlo, and Brussels, and also performed at Saint Petersburg, Odessa Moscow, London, and Geneva. Saracco put an end to his career in 1916.

He was a French industrialist and philanthropist. Biography From a Jewish Alsatian family, Weiller was the son of the industrialist and politician Lazare Weiller (1858–1928) and Alice Javal (1869–1943), scion of the Javal family, who rose to prominence in business, finance, and politics during the 19th century. Weiller studied engineering at the École Centrale Paris and graduated in 1914 with a graduate diploma. He later became an aviation hero during the First World War. Using aerial photography during his reconnaissance flights, he was shot down on several occasions and wounded.Biography from Musée aéronautique et spatial du groupe SAFRAN (accessed 23 August 2008) Receiving 12 honorable citations from the army, he was made an officer in the Legion of Honor at the age of 25 (the youngest officer in the Legion of Honor to be so awarded after Georges Guynemer and René Fonck), he finished the war next to maréchal Foch and was present at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles as an aide-de-camp to the allied armies. A business leader from the age of 29 (from 1922 to 1940), Weiller developed the most important airplane engine factory in Europe, Gnome et Rhône, which became Snecma S. A. after nationalization in 1945. From 1925, he progressively purchased capital in the aviation company CIDNA. He also participated in the creation of airlines serving Africa, which were all nationalized in 1933 to become Air France, of which he was one of the company’s first administrators (in 1933, he was offered the post of president of Air France by Pierre Cot, the then ministre de l’Air, but refused the offer). In 1940, Weiller and his family, his wife Aliki, his son Paul-Annik and his mother-in-law, Hélène Diplarakos, travelled to Bordeaux, France, where they received transit visas to Portugal from the Portuguese consul Aristides de Sousa Mendes, on 22 June. The family crossed into Portugal and stayed in Monte Estoril, at the Grande Hotel D’Itália, between 15 August and 23 August 1940, and the Hotel Atlântico, between 23 August and 25 September 1940.See 'Weiller family biography' held at the Exiles Memorial Center. The family then flew from Lisbon to New York City on the Pan Am Atlantic Clipper seaplane in October 1940, with the exception of Paul-Louis. Sousa Mendes Foundation - Diplarakos/Weiller Family. Arrested on 6 October 1940 in Royat, he was stripped of his French citizenship by the Vichy government and placed under house arrest in Marseille. He escaped in January 1942, fleeing first to Morocco, then to Cuba, and finally to Canada, where he contributed to the efforts of France libre (he was issued passport no. 1). His mother was deported and died at Auschwitz in 1944. Returning to Europe after the war, he began to concentrate his business activities first on energy (oil exploration in Venezuela and the Gulf of Mexico; natural gas exploration in Texas; electricity companies in Japan, etc.), and then later he focused on international finance. He subsequently became a philanthropist of the arts; through his influence and financial support, he contributed to the restoration of the Palace of Versailles, created a ballet company, and aided a number of artists (Robert Hossein, Roger Vadim, Maurice Béjart, Michèle Mercier, Brigitte Bardot, Alain Delon, etc.). His objective was to revive Paris as the capital of culture, an action that led to his election to the Académie des beaux-arts. Paul-Louis Weiller led an active social life associating with the royal families of Europe, business and political leaders (Aristotle Onassis, Henry Ford II, Jean Paul Getty, Richard Nixon, and Georges Pompidou, some of whom from time to time worked for him), and personalities in the arts and entertainment, whom he gathered in last of the salon traditions as described by Marcel Proust. His home on the French Riviera, the villa La Reine Jeanne (designed by the American architect Barry Dierks), attracted international society for the greater part of the 20th century. Weiller’s philanthropic activities included numerous charitable works. On 29 August 1922 in Paris, he married princess Alexandra Ghica, with whom he had one daughter, Marie- Élisabeth (wife of Irisarri; 1924–2006). Princess Alexandra was the daughter of prince Ioan Ghica (1875–1922) and Hazel-Marie Paliner-Singer (1882–1951). He later divorced on 25 March 1931 in order to marry on 31 October 1932 Aliki Diplarakou (Miss Europe of 1930) from whom he was also divorced. They had one son, Paul-Annik, whose daughter, Sibilla Weiller, married Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg, youngest son of Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, in 1994. A small park in the city of Sélestat (Bas-Rhin), of which he was made an honorary citizen, was named in his honor.

The sentence \\"Walking is good exercise\\", for example, might be pronounced as \\"Walk (pause) ing is good ex (pause) er (pause) cise\\". Additionally, stress may be placed on unusual syllables. The name is derived from literary scansion, because the speech pattern separates the syllables in a phrase much like scanning a poem counts the syllables in a line of poetry. There is no universal agreement about the exact definition of this term. Some sources require only a noticeable pause between syllables, while others require other speech abnormalities, such as the unusual stress pattern on syllables. Some sources consider it a common, but not necessary, feature of ataxic dysarthria; others consider it exactly synonymous with ataxic dysarthria. Cause Scanning speech, like other ataxic dysarthrias, is a symptom of lesions in the cerebellum. It is a typical symptom of multiple sclerosis, and it constitutes one of the three symptoms of Charcot's neurologic triad. Scanning speech may be accompanied by other symptoms of cerebellar damage, such as gait, truncal and limb ataxia, intention tremor, inaccuracies in rapidly repeated movements and sudden, abrupt nausea and vomiting.

Gerard was born in Alençon, France in 1844. At age 15, He enrolled in a seminary in the commune of Sées in France. At age 20, Gerard moved to Paris, where he apprenticed as a chef in a hotel. He then moved to London, where he worked with a newspaper on its reviews and translations (Gerard was fluent in English, German and Latin). At age 22, Gerard moved to New York City, where he again worked for a newspaper. In 1868, Gerard enlisted in the U.S. Army at Fort Hamilton, New York and was assigned to Fort D. A. Russell near Cheyenne, Wyoming. In April 1869, Gerard deserted the Army and moved to Denver, Colorado, assuming the name \\"Louis Dupuy\\". He started working for the Rocky Mountain News as a roving reporter for the mining camps. Gerard soon decided to become a miner himself. In 1873 while working in the Cold Stream Mine on Mount Sherman in Silver Plume, Colorado, he was badly injured in a delayed dynamite explosion in the Kennedy Tunnel. Gerard took the brunt of the blast and saved the life of a fellow miner. Gerard broke a rib and clavicle, and injured his left eye. Because he could not return to mining, the people of Georgetown, Colorado raised enough money for Gerard to rent the former Delmonico Bakery. He was able to purchase the property within a few years, and created a successful restaurant and hotel he called Hotel de Paris. By the early 1890s the original building had tripled in size. It contained numerous rooms, a formal dining room, a sizeable kitchen, and an apartment for Gerard. The Hotel de Paris had indoor plumbing with a washbasin in each room, as well as electric lighting, which replaced gas lighting in 1893. Dinners were served on Haviland & Co. china from Limoges, France, with elegant linens and imported glassware. The menu included steaks from cattle raised on Louis' ranch Troublesome Creek, delicacies such as oysters, and anchovies in olive oil imported from France. Gerard was an avid reader of literature and philosophy. His library contained a full set of Encyclopædia Britannica. On October 7, 1900, Gerard died from pneumonia at age 56. He left the hotel to his housekeeper Sophie Gally, who died only four months later. In 1904, the Hotel de Paris was purchased by James H. and Sarah Burkholder. Their daughter Hazel Burkholder McAdams owned the hotel until 1954, when the National Society of The Colonial Dames of America in the State of Colorado acquired it and turned it into a museum.

He was guillotined for double murder in a notorious case that involved him dissolving the bodies of his victims in sulphuric acid. Sarret's crimes reportedly inspired British serial killer John George Haigh, known as the Acid Bath Murderer. Biography Sarret was born in Trieste, of Greek descent, and emigrated to France in his youth. He studied medicine, chemistry and law at the University of Marseille. He became a lawyer and then a swindler, beginning a life insurance scam, in which two of his lovers, German sisters Catherine and Philomène Schmidt, married unhealthy men. The scheme involved another accomplice, Louis Chambon-Duverger, who would go for a medical examination while posing as one of the unhealthy husbands in order to be approved for life insurance. The husband's death would then be hastened via poison or some other measure, and the life insurance shared among the conspirators. Sarret and the sisters lived together in the suburbs of Aix- en-Provence at a villa they dubbed L'Hermitage. However, at some point Sarret decided that Chambon-Duverger had become too greedy. In 1925, Sarret murdered him along with his mistress, Noémie Ballandraux. He then dumped their corpses in sulphuric acid to dispose of their bodies. This crime went unsolved for six years until Catherine Schmidt was arrested for another life insurance scheme, in which she faked her own death by obtaining the body of a woman her own age and general description who had died of tuberculosis. Catherine moved to Nice to hide out, but fell in love with a man there and followed him to Marseille, very close to Aix-en-Provence, where she was recognized. During police interrogation, she confessed to her crimes as well as to what Sarret had done. Sarret successfully delayed trial for two years, but was found guilty in October 1933 and sentenced to death. He was guillotined a few months later by Anatole Deibler. The Schmidt sisters each received 10 years in prison. In popular culture The Sarret case was told by Solange Fasquelle in the book (Le Trio infernal) The Infernal Trio , which was adapted to the cinema in 1974 under the same title by Francis Girod, starring Michel Piccoli as Sarret, Romy Schneider as Philomène Schmidt and Mascha Gonska as Catherine Schmidt.

Iris von Roten was born in Basel, Switzerland . She was the editor of the women's paper Schweizer Frauenblatt in 1943–1945. She was a feminist, inspired by Simone de Beauvoir. She is most known for her feminist work Frauen im Laufgitter: the book received such negative criticism and hostility that she was blamed for the fact that the proposal for women's suffrage was voted down in 1959. On 6 December 1955, during the \\"Panthermantel Affair\\", von Roten was stopped by Police officers at 2 am while on the way to her analyst. The police officers did not believe that she was a lawyer and took her to the police station where she was interrogated for refusing to comply with their questions. She later claimed that she had been Arrested because she had been wearing trousers and thus the police has mistaken her for a prostitute. Feeling discriminated against, von Roten went to the news to open a dialogue about women's right. This incident in part inspired her to write her controversial book \\"Frauen im Laufgitter\\" Her book \\"Frauen im Laufgitter\\" evoked a negative reaction from men and women alike. Men saw her as man-hating and mocked her; the women of Switzerland saw her as a radical, and blamed her for the losing vote on women's suffrage. They believed in gradual change and saw her as far too extreme. von Rotens daughter Hortenia has been quoted explaining the rejection, saying: \\"Women do not like to recognize and do not gladly admit what a lousy situation they are.\\" After the negative reception of her book, she left for Turkey to fulfill a childhood dream and not, as many believed, to run from the backlash. Once in Turkey, she thoroughly enjoyed herself and did as she pleased, being able to ignore Traditional Gender roles. After her short stay in Turkey, von Roten returned to Switzerland and wrote a memoir of her Travels. It was rejected by publishers. Following her rejection, she chose to continue traveling. Iris von Roten committed suicide on 11 September 1990 at the age of 73.

During an expedition to Maboko Island in 1982–83, paleoanthropologist Martin Pickford recovered more than a hundred small catarrhine fossils. Among them, described the new genus and species Nyanzapithecus pickfordi, characterized by several dental specializations, and also transferred the Rangwapithecus species R. vancouveringi to the genus renaming it N. vancouveringorum. Nyanzapithecus was considered closely related to Rangwapithecus and Mabokopithecus based on dental similarities, and an early relative of Oreopithecus bambolii. Nyanzapithecus was originally included in Oreopithecidae before being transferred to Proconsulidae. described a new species, N. harrisoni, from Nachola, Kenya. considered Mabokopithecus clarki congeneric and even conspecific with N. pickfordi and thus renamed the latter Mabokopithecus pickfordi/clarki and Kunimatsu's species M. harrisoni. Dental morphology Nyanzapithecus pickfordi has a dental formula of 2:1:2:3 on both the upper and lower jaw. The upper premolars were long and had buccal and lingual cusps which resembled each other in size the lower molars had deep notches.

Part of it was located on the territory of the Lordship of Prilep, a realm in Macedonia ruled by the Ottoman vassal Prince Marko until his death in the Battle of Rovine.  Administrative division  When the Sanjak of Ohrid was established in 1395 it was a part of the Rumelia Eyalet and one of its earliest established sanjaks. Before it became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1395 its initial territory belonged to the realm of Prince Marko. At the beginning its county town was Bitola and later it was Ohrid, thus, it has also been referred to in sources as Sanjak of Monastir (or Bitola). The territory of the Sanjak of Ohrid changed over time. In 1406 the sanjakbey of Ohrid was Junayd of Aydın. In 1464 and 1465 the sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Ohrid was Ballaban Badera, famous for his battles against Skanderbeg, replacing Şeremet bey on that position. Although Halil Inalcik explains that the Sanjak of Elbasan was established as soon as the fortress of Elbasan has been constructed in 1466, based on Tursun Beg's records there is a possibility that Elbasan initially was part of the Sanjak of Ohrid. The official Ottoman censuses () were organized in 1467, 1519 (collective census) and 1583 on the territory of the Sanjak of Ohrid. The census from the beginning of the 16th century registered that the Sanjak of Ohrid had the kazas (districts) of Ohrid, Debar, Akçahisar (Krujë) and Mat, and had 4 towns, 6 fortresses, 849 villages, 32,648 Christian families and 623 Muslim families. According to the census of 1583 Sanjak of Ohrid had three kazas with 13 nahiye. After later expansion the Sanjak of Ohrid had 22 nahiyahs, 6 in the region of Macedonia and 16 in Albania. There was substantial presence of ethnic Albanians in this sanjak. In autumn 1794 Kara Mahmud Bushati, who was Pasha of Scutari, gained control over the Sanjak of Ohrid. During 1796-7 it was ruled by Muhtar Pasha, son of Ali Pasha. From 1820 to 1831 the Sanjak of Ohrid was put under control of another pasha of the Pashalik of Scutari, Mustafa Reshit Pasha Bushati. The administrative division of the Rumelia Eyalet was reformed, based on the sultan's hatisherif of 21 June 1836, and the territories of its sanjaks were substantially changed while Sanjak of Ohrid became an arpalik of Valide Sultan. Until 1864 it was part of the Monastir Eyalet, while the kaza of Krujë among others had been incorporated in the sanjak of Scutari during the. After the establishment of the Monastir Vilayet in 1864 the Sanjak of Ohrid ceased to exist and its territory was incorporated the Sanjak of Bitola (established as sanjak, separate from the Sanjak of Ohrid, in 1826).http://tarihvemedeniyet.org/documents/makaleler/20.%20yy%20Osmanli%20Vilayetleri.pdf Ottoman Provinces before 1908  History  Dorotheos, the Archbishop of Ohrid and his clerks and boyars were expatriated to Istanbul in 1466 probably because of their anti-Ottoman activities during Skanderbeg's rebellion. In 1467 many Christians from Skopje, Ohrid, Serres and Kastoria were forcibly deported to Elbasan, a new Ottoman fortress in Albania. Peasants of the Sanjak of Ohrid participated for ten years in the anti-Ottoman 1564 rebellion of the peasants from Mariovo and Prilep. On 25 July 1571 it was proposed to divide Sanjak of Ohrid on two part, in order to increase public security in situation of constant rebellions in this sanjak. In 1613 Ottoman authorities ordered the destruction of all newly built Christian churches in the villages of the Sanjak of Ohrid. Evliya Çelebi (1611–1682) dedicated a whole chapter of his work Seyahatname to the Sanjak of Ohrid.

On his return to Tuscany, he spoke openly against the Medici, and even participated in a conspiracy whose aim was to take power from them. Condemned by the Council of Florence to lose his head on the scaffold, he owed his salvation to the generosity of Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who banished him for life in Cedri near Volterra, after which Soderini devoted himself to the study of agriculture.

Soderini gives a major role to astrology, recommending to bring in the harvest when the Moon is in a certain sign and in decline, for \\"if one collects then less wine, at least one is sure of its quality and its conservation\\". The book is dedicated by the editor Giunti to Florentine poet Luigi Alamanni. It appeared for the first time with another treatise on the same subject by Bernardo Davanzati, and the Apology of the Melon (Popone) by Lionardo Giachini.French Wikipedia Soderini's book was reprinted separately by Domenico Maria ManniItalian Wikipedia in 1734, with some biographical information.https://archive.org/details/trattatodellacol00sode In 1590 under the alais Ciriegiulo he published the first documented mention of the Sangiovese (\\"blood of Jove\\") grape, calling it \\"Sangiogheto\\", noting that in Tuscany the grape makes very good wine, but if the winemaker is not careful, it risks turning into vinegar.

He presented to the minister of agriculture and trade a draft decree for the teaching of horticulture which, however, remained unfulfilled. In 1853, he was a professor of arboriculture at the National Conservatory of Works and Arts Conservatoire des arts et métiers in Paris. He was charged by the Ministry of Agriculture to provide lectures on fruit growing for all district departments who desired them. He gave this course up until 1870. In 1867, he and Jean Darcel were made chief engineers of the Department of Bridges and Roads, responsible among other duties for the provision of gardens, footpaths, walkways and promenades in the city of Paris, along with responsibility for the municipal and departmental arboriculture for the whole city region of Paris.

He held the seat temporarily until a tribal election could be conducted to elect a Maliseet Tribal Representative, which the Maliseet Tribe then did on December 22, 2012 when tribal members elected Henry John Bear as their first elected Tribal Representative to the Maine House of Representatives. Slagger did not seek another term as Maliseet representative. Slagger was one of three non- voting representatives from Maine's Native American tribes in the House of Representatives. Representatives from each tribe are all elected by tribal members. Slagger did not seek another term as the Maliseet representative due to the limitations placed on tribal representatives, including the inability to vote and sponsor bills without co-sponsors. Slagger was humiliated when, during a tie vote in the Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development Committee on which he sat, Slagger's deciding vote was recorded but cast aside by the committee chair. In May 2012, Slagger announced a bid for the non- tribal seat in which he lived, District 22. Still running as a non-party (independent) candidate, he challenged incumbent Republican incumbent Stacy Guerin with no Democrat in the race. He received 1,299 votes (26%) and lost. Gubernatorial campaign In February 2013, Slagger formed a campaign committee to run for Governor of Maine in 2014 as a Democrat. In April, Slagger enrolled as a Green Independent and began seeking the Maine Green Independent Party's nomination. Shortly thereafter, Slagger unenrolled as a Green Independent and continued his run as an unenrolled candidate for Governor. Slagger did not qualify for the November 2014 ballot as an independent. Personal Slagger grew up in Aroostook County, Maine and lives in Kenduskeag in Penobscot County with his wife (a Mi'kmaq) and their three children. In September 2005, Slagger, a non-traditional undergraduate at the University of Maine, was awarded an internship at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C.

Following a brief stint teaching literature and philosophy in France, Jacques Bobet immigrated to Canada and joined the NFB in 1947 as a writer at a time when 90 percent of the staff was English-speaking and its French Unit found it hard to retain French Canadian filmmakers. Bobet worked to strengthen the French Unit and retain French talent, and was appointed producer of French versions in 1951. By 1956, when he was named executive producer of the newly created Versions Unit, he had been involved in versioning approximately 500 films. That same year, the NFB's headquarters was relocated from Ottawa to Montreal, improving the NFB's reputation in French Canada and making the NFB more attractive to French- speaking filmmakers. In 1959, Bobet assumed responsibility for producing more original French-language films. In 1964, a separate French production branch was finally established, with Bobet as one of the four executive producers. He oversaw the production of some of the most important films made in Quebec during the 1960s: La lutte', The Cat in the Bag (Le Chat dans le sac), Pour la suite du monde, The Times That Are (Le Règne du jour) and The River Schooners (Les Voitures d'eau). His personal favourite was the mammoth Games of the XXI Olympiad, the official film of the 1976 Montreal Olympics. In 1982 Bobet was appointed head of NFB/private-industry co-productions, and in 1983 became executive producer of Studio C (French-language feature production). He retired from the board in 1984 but continued to teach and he co-wrote the script for The Tadpole and the Whale. Bobet once said the job of a producer was 'to do all those little things that you don't see in bringing a movie to the screen.'

He was most notable for his work as a French historian and archaeologist.  Biography  Pierre Demargne went to school at l'École normale supérieure, where he took and passed the agrégation de lettres exam. He conducted his first research in Anatolia, more specifically in the south coast of Turkey. In 1951, he initiated a series of archaeological excavations (financed by the French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs) at the ancient capital of Lycia, Xanthos, which was occupied from the 7th century BCE by the Lycians, Greeks, Romans and Byzantines for more than a thousand years. His discoveries from Xanthos, including monumental and funeral architecture and inscriptions, were a decisive step in our understanding of ancient Lycian civilization today. Pierre Demargne continued his research and publications into old age: from 1926, he was a member of the French School at Athens; and from 1969 to his death, he was a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. Overall, Pierre Demargne was a man of letters; however, he was also a fieldworker and renowned scientific expert, who was respected by the scientific community around the world. The majority of his career took place during a pivotal period in archaeological methods: from traditional archaeology, which was inspired from ancient texts and the hopes of finding treasure; to the more literary and artistic approaches of archaeology of the 17th and 18th centuries, which was inherited from the cabinets of curiosities; the archaeology of Pierre Demargne’s time was changing to ever-increasing modern methodologies and tools and also (as budgets decreased) to more systematic and rigorous field methods.

Biography Pierre Dominique Dunoyer de Segonzac was born on March 10, 1908 in Toulon. He is the son of Charles Dunoyer de Segonzac, naval officer, and Adèle Desvaux. His childhood takes place in the various maritime bases in which his father is affected: mainly Toulon and Lorient. As a child, during the war of 1914–1918, he spent a few years in Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat, in the Limousin, where his mother settled, while his father was engaged in the Atlantic then in the Mediterranean and France. black Sea. At the beginning of the war of 1939–1945, at the head of his squadron of tanks of the 4th regiment of cuirassiers, he fought near a Quesnoy a regiment of panzers supported by a regiment of riflemen, and fights until the armistice. He then becomes the director of the School of the cadres of Uriage, which he creates immediately after the defeat of 1940 with the support of the secretariat to the Youth of the Vichy regime. Resisting the multiple pressures exerted by the regime, Dunoyer de Segonzac spares his school a great autonomy which allows him to make of it a place of reflection, a breeding ground of the Resistance. At the closing of the school by the Laval government at the end of 1942, he went into hiding and his team spread in many maquis (the Vercors, the Paris region, Brittany, the North ...). At the beginning of February 1943, he made contact with Captain Pommiès while he was in Toulouse for the development of an intelligence and counterintelligence service1. Subsequently, he himself took command of the French Forces Interior (FFI) Zone A Tarn with which it frees the cities of the region (Castres, Mazamet, Béziers). Constituting his troops in regiment (the 12th Dragons), he took Autun, entered Nevers to join with the 1st Army of General de Lattre. He enters Germany after very hard fighting in the Vosges.

Biography Noguès was born in Rennes, to Marthe Vallée and Émile Noguès; his father was a Colonel in the artillery. He taught himself to fly in 1909, and served in various French air squadrons during World War I, receiving command of Escadrille 73 in March 1918. During the war he received both the Croix de Guerre, multiple citations, and the Legion of Honour (the highest decoration in France). Toward the end of the war, 29 July 1918, Noguès married Magdalene Gicquel. Dissatisfied with city life, in 1922 he joined the Franco- Romanian Air Transport Company (CFRNA, later CIDNA), flying primarily the Paris–Strasbourg route, but including flights as far east as Moscow. In 1924 he received the Medal of Encouragement to Progress (la médaille d'Encouragement au Progrès) and the vermeil medal from the Aéro-Club de France for establishing the Bucarest–Constantinople–Ankara air route. In 1926 he joined the Transair Courier Company (Compagnie des Messageries Transaériennes) (later part of Air Orient) initiating flights to Syria and then Lebanon. He was the chief pilot for Air Orient and in 1931 he extended the Syrian route to Saigon in then French Indochina. When Air Orient merged to become Air France in 1933, Noguès became the executive vice president in charge of expanding the airline's routes. In December 1933 he took a prototype Dewoitine D.332, named Emeraude on a test-of-concept flight to Saigon. On the last leg of the return flight in January he encountered a snowstorm over central France and crashed into a hill near Corbigny. Noguès and all nine passengers were killed, including Pierre Pasquier, the Governor-General of French Indochina, and Emmanuel Chaumé, the French Director General of Civil Aviation. The probable cause of the crash was excessive icing. At the time he died, Noguès was actively working on both extending the Saigon–Hanoi route to Hong Kong and Canton, as well as the feasibility of a South Atlantic route to Brazil.  Legacy  In 1938, Syria issued a postage stamp commemorating Noguès and the ten years of operations on the Paris-Damascus air route.Scott #C88 - Scott (2008) \\"Syria: Air Post Stamps\\" Scott 2009 Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue Volume 6 (165th edition) Scott Publishing Co., Sidney, Ohio, pages 392–393.

He is best known for an around-the-world flight he made as copilot and navigator in 1927-1928 which included history's first flight across the South Atlantic Ocean, and for record-setting nonstop long-distance flights he made or attempted between 1929 and 1931. Biography Early life Le Brix was born on 22 February 1899 in Baden, Morbihan, in the Brittany region of northwestern France.Menim Encyclopedia: Joseph Le Brix Early career Le Brix enrolled in the French naval academy, the École Navale, in Brest on 2 April 1918 and completed his basic seamanship training aboard the academy's training ship, the French Navy armored cruiser Jeanne d'Arc. After graduating from the academy, he served aboard the armored cruiser Jules Michelet. He then began training as a naval aviator in 1924, and qualified as an aerial observer and navigator in September 1924. Promoted to lieutenant de vaisseau (\\"ship-of- the-line lieutenant\\"), he received his pilot's license in March 1925. By August 1925, Le Brix was serving in French Naval Aviation's Escadrille (Squadron) 5.B.2 and taking part in the Rif War, flying missions over Spanish Morocco in a Farman F.60 Goliath. He flew geographic survey missions over the Sahara Desert in southern French Morocco until 1927, pioneering the use of maritime navigation techniques not yet in wide use aboard aircraft. For his service, he was awarded the Croix de Guerre and the Legion of Honor. Flight around the world By October 1927, Le Brix was a capitain de corvette (\\"corvette captain,\\" the equivalent of a lieutenant commander). On 10 October, he and the French aviator Dieudonné Costes left Paris in the Breguet 19 G.R. Nungesser-Coli to attempt a trip around the world, with Costes as pilot and Le Brix as copilot and navigator. Their first leg was a flight to Saint Louis, Senegal, where they landed on 11 October. The second leg was the worlds first aerial crossing of the South Atlantic Ocean, flying from Saint-Louis to Port Natal, Brazil, on 14–15 October. The two men then visited every country in South America before flying north across Panama and Mexico to the United States, reaching Washington, D.C., on 6 February 1928. By this time, their friendship had broken down, to the point that they almost had a fistfight during a reception hosted by the French ambassador in Washington. Despite their growing dislike for one another, the two men pushed on, flying across the United States to San Francisco, California. There they boarded a ship to cross the Pacific Ocean by sea. Arriving in Tokyo, Japan, they resumed their flight, stopping in French Indochina, India, French Syria, and Greece before completing their trip with an arrival before an enthusiastic crowd at Paris–Le Bourget Airport in Paris on 14 April 1928. The trip had covered 57,410 kilometers (35,652 miles) by air in 338 flight hours over 187 days with 43 stops. Le Brix's relationship with Costes was ruined, however; upon arrival at Paris–Le Bourget, Le Brix supposedly said sharply, \\"Finally I am no longer the servant of Costes.\\"Donald, p. 187. The round-the-world flight made Le Brix one of France's most famous aviators. Le Brix and Costes were both awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross by a special act of the Congress of the United States on 2 May 1928 in recognition of their achievement.American Decorations Awarded Under the Authority of the Congress of the United States January 1, 1927 to June 30, 1937.

After completing the around- the-world trip, Le Brix became an instructor at the flight school of the École Navale in Brest, training pilots for both French Naval Aviation and the French Army's air service, the Aéronautique Militaire. France-Saigon flight attempts Now rivals, Le Brix and Costes planned to set out in early 1929 in separate attempts to become the first pilot to fly from Paris to Saigon in French Indochina in fewer than five stages. Le Brix secretly set out first, taking off in February in the Bernard 197GR from Istres, France, with his copilot Antoine Paillard and mechanic Camille Jousse. They had already reached Tunis in French Tunisia when Costes learned of their departure and angrily decided to take off in his own aircraft even though its engine was not yet ready for the flight; the engine failed soon after Costes took off and he crashed into a forest near Paris, although he survived. Meanwhile, Le Brix, Paillard, and Jousse flew 11,220 kilometers (6,968 miles) to Burma before having to crash-land in tidal waters 30 miles south of Moulmein on 26 February 1929, wrecking the Bernard 197GR and Jousse breaking a leg. Le Brix made a second attempt to fly from France to Saigon in December 1929. Taking off in a Potez 34 on 16 December with Maurice Rossi as copilot, he again got as far as Burma, flying 10,500 kilometers (6,521 miles) in 72 hours of flight time before the two men had to bail out over the rain forest on 22 December 1929 after encountering severe weather. Closed-circuit records In June 1931, Le Brix, Dewoitine chief pilot Marcel Doret, and mechanic René Mesmin broke the record for the longest flight over a closed circuit, flying the Dewoitine D.33 Trait d'Union, funded by the French billionaire François Coty. In a 70-hour nonstop flight from Istres that lasted from 7 to 10 June, they flew 10,372 kilometers (6,441 miles). They also set eight other closed-circuit records, including for flight duration and speed. Paris-Tokyo flight attempts and death Le Brix, Doret, and Mesmin decided to follow up their success by using Trait d'Union to attempt the first non-stop flight between Paris and Tokyo. Taking off from Paris–Le Bourget Airport on 12 July 1931, they had made it to the vicinity of Lake Baikal in Siberia when the aircraft's engine iced up. Le Brix and Mesmin parachuted to safety, and Doret crash- landed the plane into the treetops of a Siberian forest. All three men survived unharmed. Undaunted, the men decided to make a second attempt, departing Paris–Le Bourget Airport on 11 September 1931 in a second Dewoitine D.33 named Trait d'Union II, hoping to beat their competitors, Paul Codos and Henri Robida, who took off the same day in the Breguet 19 TF Super Bidon Point d'Interrogation also intending to fly nonstop to Tokyo; Codos and Robida, however, were forced to land at Düsseldorf, Germany, after only a few hours. Flying on, Le Brix, Doret, and Mesmin were over Ufa in the Soviet Union on 12 September when the aircraft's engine failed and they decided to bail out. Doret jumped first, parachuting to safety. Mesmin apparently had trouble with his parachute and could not follow, so Le Brix stayed with the airplane rather than leave Mesmin alone on board. The D.33 crashed and caught fire, killing both Le Brix and Mesmin. France honored Le Brix with a state funeral at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on 25 September 1931. He was buried in his native Baden. The crash of Trait d'Union II and death of Le Brix prompted the French government to refuse clearance to any French aviator who wished to attempt to set a nonstop long-distance record with a flight that took him or her beyond the borders of Metropolitan France. Until it lifted the ban in 1933, French aviators were forced to attempt to set such records only on closed-circuit courses within Metropolitan France. Commemoration In January 1932, the French aviators Lucien Bossoutrot and Maurice Rossi named the Blériot 110 they used to set several nonstop flight distance records Joseph Le Brix in Le Brix's honor. Rennes–Saint-Jacques Airport also was named for him, as was a school in Baden, and a bridge in the town of Bono is named Pont Joseph Le Brix. Streets in Baden, Nantes, Lorient, Bourges, Toulouse, Tours, Marseille, Vannes, Pontivy, and Saint-Avé, among others, bear his name, as does a plaza in Langueux. The Passions and Wings museum in Baden is dedicated to Le Brix and his biography, and a memorial plaque in his honor is mounted on the façade of Collège Jules Simon in Vannes, where he was a student. The French Navy frigate Le Brix (F715), which served as a weather ship while in commission from 1948 to 1958, was named in Le Brix's honor. Notes References * Donald, David, ed.

Career  First employed in the Lumière factories, where he entered in 1894, he became a portrait photographer in Paris, where he settled in Antoine Lumière's studio at 8 boulevard des Italiens, above the Robert-Houdin Theater, property of the future filmmaker Georges Méliès. This and that allow him to enter the world of cinematography. From 1898 to 1906, he was the cameraman for surgeon Eugène Doyen for whom he filmed for educational purposes around sixty operations. He worked there with: Ambroise-François Parnaland (1854 - 1913), who founded in 1908 with Charles Jourjon (1876 - 1934) the Éclair Laboratories. In 1899, the production company Association frères Lumière hired him as a cinematographer collaborator and technician for the shooting of the film Excursion automobile Paris-Meulan. Quickly, he started producing and directing feature films such as Le Duel d'Hamlet or Cyrano de Bergerac. With Henri Lioret, he developed the Phono- Cinema-Theater, a pioneering system of sound cinema, presented at the Universal Exhibition of 1900.

He was born Bolesław Kamil Plucinski in Lublin, Poland (then part of the Russian Empire) and died in Nice, France. Boleslaw Kamil Plucinski professionally known as Armand Dutertre was a silent movie and theater actor. Born in Lublin on 17 July 1854, his father, Apolinary Plucinski, was a Polish insurgent, on of the organizers of the January Uprising in Lublin in January 1863. It was also the reason which forced Plucinski's family to move to Paris. After having arrived in Paris, Apolinary Plucinski started working as a professor in Polish school. Young Bolesław had a great opportunity to be educated in two languages and two cultures. He began his acting lessons very early; he was formed by the great actors from La comedy Française, what was his highest reference. During his career in Paris he appeared in many notable productions at the Théâtre de l'Odéon, Théâtre des Batignolles, Fantasies-Parisienne Theatre, as well as at theatres in Reims, Brussels, Nice. Armand Dutertre – his pseudonym in France as an actor – appeared in thirty-five silent films. Among his numerous roles, his favourite was the one of the priest in Le Roman d'un Mousse (1914). It was one of Léonce Perret's movies with whom Dutertre made thirteen films. The most successful film in his career was The Garden of Allah (1927) directed by Rex Ingram, one of the most important movie director of this epoch. The film was shot on location in Cairo and Nice and had international success with very good reviews. After many great performances and because of his talent, he was nominated as a director in the Theater in Cairo. The repertoire composed by Dutertre was only including the most valuable texts. He was also a director of Theatre in Brussels. In Nice, he worked for fifteen years as a professor as well as teaching acting at the Villa Thiole - the oldest fine arts school in the city. For most of his life, Bolesław Kamil Plucinski was connected with the Association of Polish Students at the Polish School in Paris. He was invited to speak at many Polish cultural events. He was always satisfied to participate; he was born in a patriotic family and he always maintained his Polish identity. Plucinski was married twice and had two children. Both children died before him. His first wife, Marie Plucinska (née Brzezicka) was a Polish pianist. Afterward, he married a factory worker from Saint-Quentin named Marie-Jeanne, who cared from him until his death. Despite his impressive career, Plucinski spent the last of his years in poverty and suffering from kidney disease. Before his death, he was motivated to perform some poetry recitals in the United States of America. On 31 May 1932, aged 78, Pluciński died after an episode of uremia while in hospital. He was interred at the Cimetière du Grand Jas in Cannes on 2 June 1932 in a white marble tomb next to his mother and his first wife.

Allen was born in Buffalo, New York, the son of Daniel Williams Allen and Anna née Moore. He studied at Cornell University, where he obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1907, his Master of Arts in 1908 and his Ph.D. in 1911. His thesis is entitled \\"The Red-Winged Blackbird: A Study in the Ecology of a Cattail Marsh\\". From 1911 to 1912 he went on an expedition to Colombia, and from 1912 to 1916, he was appointed an instructor in zoology at Cornell. Former stockbroker Albert R. Brand was one of his graduate students. Brand collaborated with Cornell's engineering department to record bird songs, publishing two books accompanied by phographs.https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/about/history/early-milestones/ He became an assistant professor in 1916, and a professor in 1926. Arthur continued his career at Cornell until his retirement in 1953, After his retirement, he was a public lecturer for the National Audubon Society from 1953 to 1959. It has been estimated that over 10,000 students took his courses, including over 100 doctoral students, at a time when Cornell was the only institution to offer advanced degrees in ornithology. Through his work, Allen introduced the field of ornithology to generations of professionals and amateurs. Allen observing ivory-billed woodpeckers on the Singer tract in 1935 In 1935 Allen led an expedition to the Singer Tract in Louisiana to search for ivory-billed woodpeckers. They did discover some, in what was to turn out to be the last documented, definite sighting, including photographs and audio. In the early 2000s there was a flurry of excitement at possible sightings in the same region, but controversy surrounds how sure the sightings were. Allen released a published an ornithological history in 1933 under the title Fifty Years' Progress of American Ornithology, 1883–1933. He was dedicated to promoting the study of birds to a wide audience, in his books, films and public lectures. His Book of Bird Life (1930, reissued in 1961) was a well- written introduction to ornithology for its time. He also conducted pioneering studies on recording bird songs in 1929 which led to the first record on the phonograph of bird songs in 1932. He worked on what eventually became the independent Cornell Lab of Ornithology in 1955, and founded the Wildlife Society in 1936, leading the organisation from 1938 to 1939. Personal life Allen married Elsa Guerdrum in 1913. They had five children. His wife also received a doctorate at Cornell and pursued a successful career as a historian of ornithology.

Catholic Scouting Fr Sevin was exempted from military service in 1902 and remained in Belgium through the First World War. In 1916 he was appointed professor at the college of Tuquet in Mouscron, near the French border. Eight days after his arrival in Mouscron, the Germans took over the college as a military hospital. It was then that Father Sevin became involved in the Scouting movement then gaining strength in the United Kingdom. Between 1917 and 1919, he wrote his classic book Scouting and established the first Catholic Scout troop in Mouscron in 1918. Scouting, being an import from Britain, was strongly disparaged in ecclesiastical circles of the time. But Father Sevin was able to demonstrate that it could be revised to correspond to a deep Christian vision of man. By the founding of the Scout Association of France in July 1920, he absorbed the experiences of Catholic Scouting that had existed in France since 1911 and became the architect of an alliance between Scouting on the model established by Lord Baden-Powell and the Christian Gospel. He began publishing the monthly newsletter Le Chef in 1921. According to Mother Madeleine Bourcereau, \\"The meeting between the Scout method and intuitions of P. Sevin, has developed a pedagogy based on Gospel values, where each young person is encouraged to flourish and develop his or her personality by drawing out the latent talent within himself or herself.

Early life Ollokot was the son of Tuekakas or Old Joseph and the younger brother of Chief Joseph. His father and brother were advocates of peace and passive resistance to encroachments by White settlers and miners on the land of the Nez Perce. Ollokot, described as tall, graceful, intelligent, fun-loving and daring, was a hunter and warrior but also experienced in diplomacy, accompanying his father and older brother to treaty negotiations between the U.S. and Nez Perce in 1855 and 1863.Hampton, Bruce.

O. Howard. Howard demanded that Joseph's and Ollokot's people move from their traditional lands in the Wallowa Valley of Oregon to a reservation established for them in Idaho. Although Ollokot supported the peace initiatives of his brother in council, Howard believed that behind the scenes Ollokot was on the side of the \\"reckless young men, who would rather than not have a fight with the white men.\\"Hampton, p. 50 Ollokot was married to Tamalwinonmi (Cloudburst) and the couple had one child who later became known as Sarah Connor.\\"Ollokot\\" http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3892.html, accessed 3 Jan 2012 War Although Joseph and Ollokot acceded to Howard's demand that the Nez Perce relocate to the reservation, a handful of Nez Perce warriors, outraged by abuses they had suffered and the Murder of a Nez Pierce man falsely accused of stealing a horse, precipitated the war by attacking and killing 18 White settlers in June 1877. General Howard sent out two companies of cavalry to punish the Nez Perce, but at the Battle of White Bird Canyon on 17 June, 70 Nez Perce, led by Ollokot, decisively defeated a larger force of soldiers and civilian volunteers.McDermott, John D.

Although Chief Joseph is usually considered the leader of the Nez Perce, the war chiefs such as Ollokot, Looking Glass, White Bird, and Toohoolhoolzote probably determined the strategy and tactics of the Indians. The Nez Perce won victories, or escaped from larger U.S. army forces, in battles at Cottonwood, Clearwater, Big Hole, and Canyon Creek. Ollokot and 60 young men surrounded and pinned down a larger number of soldiers at the Battle of the Big Hole, permitting the Nez Perce to escape.

The site was discovered by Louis Dubertret and materials studied by Jacques Cauvin. Heavy Neolithic materials recovered resembled those from Qaraoun. History In 1875, Victor Guérin found here a village with 800 Metualis.Guérin, 1880, pp. 268-269 He further noted: \\"Its principal mosque, now in ruins, is built of superb blocks, apparently ancient. It contains in the interior several monolithic columns.\\"Guérin, 1880, pp. 268-269; as given in Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 139 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) noted here: \\"There are several sarcophagi and cisterns in the village ; some caves near.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 139 They further described it as: \\"A large well-built village, built of stone, containing about 600 Metawileh and 400 Moslems. The Caimacam has a good house here. There are some figs and olives round the village and arable land; water is supplied from a spring and two birkets.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 90 Modern era On August 5, during the 2006 Lebanon War, Israeli war- planes killed 3 civilians, aged 2 to 48 years of age.

It is visible from the American Legion Memorial Bridge of the Capital Beltway, just downriver (east) of the bridge. Plummers Island (on the right), from across Rock Run Culvert Scientific study of Plummers Island began in 1899, when botanist Charles Louis Pollard formed the Washington Biologists' Field Club and began the search for a field camp near the club's Washington, D.C. home. The club leased the island in 1901, and bought it seven years later; the island is now owned by the U.S. National Park Service. A 2008 issue of the Bulletin of the Biological Society of Washington was dedicated to articles about the flora and fauna of the island. The study of the island's three main plant communities, riparian, terrace, and upland forest, documented 3,012 insect species in 253 families, in 18 orders: Collembola, Odonata, Dermaptera, Blattodea, Phasmatodea, Orthoptera, Psocoptera, Thysanoptera, Hemiptera, Neuroptera, Megaloptera, Coleoptera, Mecoptera, Trichoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, Siphonaptera, and Hymenoptera. Another of the studies reported 19 species of freshwater mollusks (7 bivalves, 12 gastropods) in the island's immediate area, bringing the total known for the Middle Potomac River to 42 species.Timothy A.

Surrounded by magnificent landscape of the Dyje (Thaya) River Valley, Cornštejn Castle stands on a strategic location, not far from an Eneolithic fortified settlement. Though in ruins now, it still shows what a lofty medieval residence and fortress it once was. The Dyje (Thaya) River, now impounded by Vranov Dam, flows around the castle in a big meander. The name of the castle is derived from German \\"Zorn\\" (anger) and \\"Stein\\" (stone).  History  It was built on royal demesne land which was subordinated to Bítov Castle and which was pawned and later (1308) granted as a fief to the noble family of Lichtenburg. In the 1320s Raimund of Lichtenburg, King Wenceslaus II’s favourite, decided to strengthen the security of Bítov Castle and the road connecting Bítov with Vranov Castle by building a fort – Zornstein / Cornštejn. After all, Raimund’s sons had to be provided for as well. According to the instrument issued by Moravian Margrave Charles on 31 May 1343, Raimund\`s sons Smil and Czenek were allowed to divide their father’s domain with \\"Vethow\\" and \\"Czornstein\\" castles. This is the first written record of Cornštejn we know of.Codex diplomaticus et epistolaris Moraviae 7, p.347. http://147.231.53.91/src/index.php?s=v&cat;=3&bookid;=68&page;=351 Originally a small Gothic noble residence with a Courtyard, a high enclosing wall (Enceinte) and a palace (guarded by a high shield-wall) gradually developed into a large medieval fortress. In the latter half of 14th century Henry of Lichtenburg built a pre-wall around the whole castle, which is how the Upper Bailey came to being. In the first third of 15th century Albrecht and John of Lichtenburg and Zornstein erected another palace on the other side of the Courtyard and established the Lower Ward with barracks and some other buildings, surrounded by a new ring of curtain walls with two new gates and two bastions. In 1422 the castle was besieged by the Hussite troops, which afterwards made the lords of the castle fortify the dangerous strategic hill south of Cornštejn with a detached outwork. The Lichtenburg Family had become very powerful by that time. John of Lichtenburg even dared to wage war with Austrian lords and oppose to Holy Roman King Frederick III. Also John\`s son Hynek of Lichtenburg was very powerful. Supported by Pope Pius II, he denied allegiance to King George of Bohemia, and stood up to him in 1463. In turn, Hynek was declared a traitor by the Moravian Diet and his fortress Cornštejn was assaulted.František Palacký, Dějiny národu českého v Čechách a v Moravě, díl IV. Praha 1894. However, Cornštejn turned out to be impossible to be stormed in a few days! The siege lasted eleven months in the end! For Hynek, the power of Pope ius II proved to be of no avail. King George punished Hynek and confiscated the castle. Cornštejn was subsequently granted to Wolfgang Kraiger of Kraigk who reconstructed the castle and modernised both the palaces. His sons Lipolt and Henry then built an up-to-date advanced fort on the rocky platform south of the castle, reflecting latest trends in artillery warfare. After 1526 the castle got back into the hands of the Lichtenburgs of Bítov. In 1542 the Moravian Estates ordered that Cornštejn be repaired and improved so as to withstand a possible Turkish assault. Fortunately, the Ottoman army never made it to southern Moravia, and Cornštejn was spared. However, the time of medieval castles was over by the late 16th century and there was no need to maintain Gothic fortresses any longer. After the Lichtenburgs died out in 1576, the new owners – Streuns of Schwarzenau abandoned the castle and may well have got all roofs removed (so as not to pay tax). Thus Cornštejn began to fall into ruin and none of the noble families that owned the castle after the Streuns (1617 Jankovský of Vlašim, 1788 Counts von Daun, 1912 the Haases von Hasenfels) would change anything about it. In 1945, pursuant to the decrees of President Edvard Beneš, Cornštejn was confiscated from the Haases and nationalised. In the early 1970s two thirds of the castle were reconstructed by the Monument Preservation Institute, Brno. Since 1987, Cornštejn has been administered and maintained by the South Moravian Museum in Znojmo. The castle ruins have been stabilised and since 1998 open to public.

He grew up in Chilton, County Durham, and as a youth played for the Chilton School team. Robinson went on to assist Kirk Merrington, Shildon Athletic and Chilton Colliery Railway before joining Football League First Division side Sunderland on amateur terms in September 1929. Although he was awarded a professional contract the following month, he failed to break into the first team and spent the entire season playing with the reserves in the North Eastern League. Robinson left Sunderland in May 1930 and was signed by Third Division North club Nelson. He made his senior debut for Nelson in the opening match of the 1930–31 season, a 4–5 defeat away at Rochdale on 30 August 1930.Dykes (2009), p. 84 Robinson scored his first Football League goal on 20 September 1930, netting his side's first in a 2–2 draw with New Brighton at Seedhill. He was on the scoresheet again four games later in the 2–4 defeat to Crewe Alexandra. Robinson kept his place in the first team for most of the first half of the season, although Archie Howarth and Tom Carmedy also played at outside-left occasionally. On 20 December 1930 he scored his third goal of the season, a penalty kick, in the 2–0 win against Wrexham. Nelson progressed to the second round of the FA Cup in the 1930–31 campaign and Robinson played in all three matches, scoring once. He made his final appearance for the club on 24 January 1931 as Nelson were beaten 0–2 at New Brighton. In February 1931, Robinson was released by Nelson along with several other players because of financial problems at the club. He spent the remainder of the season with Hartlepools United, where he scored one goal in six league games. In the summer of 1931 he returned to the North Eastern League with Spennymoor United. After spending the 1931–32 season with the County Durham club, Robinson was offered a short-term contract by Darlington. He signed for the Quakers in August 1932, marking a return to the Third Division North, but played only one first-team game before leaving the club the following month. Robinson subsequently had spells in non-League football with Crook Town and Horden Colliery Welfare before retiring from football.
