The extended play was released on November 22, 2011 through Paper + Plastick records. The EP focuses on \\"stripped down\\" acoustic songs, including three acoustic versions of songs from their debut album 'End Measured Mile', two original songs and a cover of Touch√© Amor√©. The record was engineered and produced by Greg Thomas at Silver Bullet Studios in Burlington, Connecticut. Background James Carroll, Make Do and Mend's lead vocalist has stated that the extended play was something they've \\"talked about doing for a while.\\" Its creation was rooted in the encouragement from fans and close friends to do acoustic versions of their songs and it became an opportunity for the band to \\"explore the versatility of [Make Do and Mend's] songs and also expolore our boundaries as songwriters.\\" The band also wished to add a cover onto the record, but were split between picking an iconic band or doing something different with a modern song. They then decided to cover Touch√© Amor√© believing the choice might \\"throw people off\\". The release acted as a learning experience for the band as they were writing their second album Everything You Ever Loved. Vocalist James Carroll said that the band learned that \\"we're able to incorporate a little more dynamic into our songs, and that it doesn't have to be loud, hard and fast at all times.\\" Release Despite initially being planned to be released for November 21, 2011 it was instead released the next day on November 22. To accompany the release of both physical and digital copies of the extended play the band uploaded the entire EP onto their Facebook profile for streaming. The physical release of the EP came in both Compact Disc form and 12‚Äù vinyl. The vinyl release came in two variations; with a limited to 100 copies colour combination of yellow with black haze and the commonly distributed version transparent blue with white haze. Reception The album gained little attention from mainstream critics but received generally favourable reviews from others. Nick Robbins of Alter The Press gave the album a four stars out of five rating, praising the album for its stripped down reconstruction of tracks from their debut album, End Measured Mile describing them as \\"almost different songs that evoke completely different moods. In fact, there's a pleasure in playing the acoustic and full- blooded versions side-by-side, to see how two seemingly identical songs can be constructed so differently.\\" Luke Davis of Dead Press gave the album nine out of ten stars spoke about the extended plays soft and melodic songs and in summary calling the ep \\"outstanding\\". Rob Watson-Lang when writing for Ourzone Magazine credetied the band for the folk-rock influences shown on the two new songs. Chris Marshman of Punktastic expressed concern for the band doing an extended play of acoustic songs, saying: \\"a band known for their heavier sound, an entirely acoustic EP was always going to a risky move.\\" He did however give the album a four out of five star rating saying it \\"delivers on a big scale, proving that Make Do and Mend are far from a one trick pony, and also potentially on the verge of something great.\\" Track listing References 2011 EPs Make Do and Mend albums ","title":"Part and Parcel"},{"id":"34290136","text":"The Lower Moors is a wetland between Hugh Town and Old Town Bay on St Mary's, the largest island in the Isles of Scilly.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago off the southwestern tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. The site is owned and managed by the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust and is within the Isles of Scilly Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. First designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1971 for its range of wetland habitats; it is an important feeding station for migrating and wintering birds such as common snipe and water rail. In 2007 Cavell Smith found a (great blue heron); the first confirmed record for Britain. The second British record for great blue heron also occurred on Lower Moor and, was also found by Cavell Smith. Wildlife and ecology Reed beds in the Lower Moors reserve Lower Moors is one of two wetlands on St Mary's and is designated as a SSSI for its wide range of wetland habitats, and also as a feeding site for passage and wintering birds. The marsh is fed by ground water and small streams forming small open pools, mire and willow scrub, and the marsh once extended from Old Town Bay to Porthloo Pool . As late as the 1960s there were wet fields around Porthloo Pool and Rose Hill with hemlock water-dropwort (Oenanthe crocata), lesser water-plantain (Baldellia ranunculoides) and yellow iris (Iris pseudacorus); but these fields are much dryer nowadays. Lesser water-plantain has not been seen on the Isles of Scilly since the year 2000. The site can be entered via a short lane at Old Town, the original medieval settlement on St Mary‚Äôs, or from the A3111 near Porth Mellon. The soils are wet, alluvium and peat overlying Hercynian granite bedrock. Since grazing was withdrawn some of the marsh is overgrown with abundant common reed (Phragmites australis), rushes (Juncus sp) and grey willow (Salix cinerea). The drainage ditches, flow southward to Old Town Bay and divide the marsh into wet meadows with abundant soft rush (Juncus effusus), yellow iris and some ragged robin (Lychnis flos- cuculi) and greater bird‚Äôs-foot trefoil (Lotus pedunculatus). Bramble (Rubus fruticosus) and bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) dominate the drier areas. Lower Moors is a vital feeding area for resident birds, such as Eurasian coot, gadwall, mallard, common moorhen, Eurasian teal and various warblers. The small area of open water is important for passage snipe and water rail, while the reed beds and wet meadows are used by birds such as corncrake and spotted crake. The first records of the short-winged cone-head was on St Agnes in 1989, confirmed in 1992 and found on Lower Moors in 1996. The eggs can be carried on vegetation as sea flotsam so it could have been established on Scilly earlier than 1989. Great blue heron To most bird watchers the Isles of Scilly are associated with rare birds, migrants and vagrants. The first accepted record of a great blue heron in Britain was recorded on 7 December 2007, by Cavell Smith at Lower Moors, and subsequently added to the British List of birds by the British Ornithologists' Union Records Committee (BOURC). On 14 April 2015, Cavell Smith observed two herons from the bird-hide on Lower Moor, one was a grey heron and the other a great blue heron; the second British record (if accepted by the (BOURC). It had since been seen at Old Town Bay, on Tresco and on Bryher. Two previous records of the bird in Britain had had assisted passages aboard ships.

The family seat of the same name is an eponymous castle on the River Fuhse in Salzgitter-Salder. Originally the family, whose branches are still alive today, only owned estates in the Lower Saxony area, but from the middle of the 16th century they also owned extensive property in the March of Brandenburg.  Family history  According to legend the founder of the line (Stammherr), Sieghard de Rosis, came to Germany from Rome in 718 with St. Boniface. In 1102, the family is mentioned for the first time in the chronicle, Chronicon coenobii Sancti Michaelis, in Hildesheim. According to this document, the knightly family of von Saldern was enfeoffed that year with tithe rights (mit den Zehnten) by St. Michael's Abbey near Nettlingen (S√∂hlde). According to historical records the first member of the family to be classed amongst the nobiles layci (\\"lay nobility\\") was Thidericius de Saldere in 1161.Urkundenbuch des Hochstifts Hildesheim 1, p. 308-311 The titled aristocratic line begins in 1226 with the knight, Burchard von Salder. From 1299 to 1332, a Johann von Salder is also recorded.  Lichtenberg Castle  In 1267, the Duke of Brunswick and L√ºneburg, Otto the Child, bequeathed the L√ºneburg estates to his son, John. These included Lichtenberg Castle in present-day Salzgitter, thus John became the lord of the castle (Burgherr). In 1273 records show that court jurisdiction [\\"circa castrum Lichtenberg\\"] was exercised in the castle. In 1299, Aschwin von Salder was named as the judge and bailiff (Richter and Amtmann) here. It is possible that the lords of Saldern had already been given advocacy rights (Vogteirechte) by this time. According to the book of fees (Fehdebuch) for the town of Brunswick, the lords of Saldern carried out raids in the surrounding area between 1379 and 1382. In 1379 Aschwin attacked a baggage train of goods wagons with 17 tonnes of herrings. The booty was carried off to Lichtenberg castle with the enforced assistance of the escort. As well as Aschwin, other robber barons occupied the castle, such as Jan and Borchhard von Saldern, Sieverd von Broistede and Kord von dem Steinberge. In 1388, after Lichtenberg Castle had returned to the possession of the Brunswick dukes, the lords of Saldern were once again given the castle as a fief. Between 1390 and 1396 Duke Frederick renewed the enfeoffment of castle and court to the lords of Saldern. In the 15th century, however, they were apparently driven from the castle, because other families are named as the castle advocates (Burgv√∂gte).  Entailed estates  Former fortified entailed estates (Fideikommiss) of the family: * Wilsnack (owned by the family since 1560), consisting of Wilsnack, √ñvelg√ºnde and Jackel, (Westprignitz) and Werder/Altmark In the Church of the Precious Blood (Wunderblutkirche) in Bad Wilsnack there is a number of artefacts that bear witness to the family. The pulpit of the church was sponsored by Jakob Friedrich von Saldern (born 18 April 1658, died 24 December 1698) after the death of his wife, Ottilie Elisabeth von Bismarck (1659‚Äì1695). The pulpit is decorated with the coats of arms of the von Saldern and Bismarck families. To the right and left of the organ are two epitaphs. The right-hand one is in memory of Matthias Friedrich von Saldern (born 22 April 1650; died 3 June 1680). The oval portrait, painted in oil on wood, has cherubs on both sides. Underneath is a relief with a portrayal of von Saldern bearing arms. The epitaph to the left of the organ commemorates the Prussian court baron and Court of Appeal advisor (Hof- und Kammergerichtsrat), Friedrich August von Saldern (born 28 June 1694; died 20 February 1729), and his wife, Elisabeth Charlotte von Saldern (born 17 December 1688; dided 5 April 1732), (daughter of Siegfried Christoph von Saldern of Plattenburg; widow of von Krosigk) as well as other members of the family. * Klein-Leppin (Westprignitz) * The Plattenburg, bought by Matthias von Saldern (1508‚Äì1575), a fief since 1552, hereditary possession of the family from 1560 to 1945 with Plattenburg and Zernikow (Westprignitz)  Other estates  Around 1400 Aschwin von Saldern is named as the vassal (Pfandinhaber) of Wohldenberg Castle near Holle. On 22 May 1406 troops under the Hildesheim bishop, John III of Hoya, Henry of Bortfeld and Burghard of Cramm, destroyed the walls of Gebhardshagen castle (today Salzgitter- Gebhardshagen) and captured it. The ducal vassals, Jan and Burchhard von Saldern, were ordered to rebuild the armoury, the Red and the Grey Towers. In the 14th century, the family held fiefs in Nettlingen (today a village in the municipality of S√∂hlde in Hildesheim district) belonging to the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel and Principality of Hildesheim. Around 1325, the counts of Wohldenberg enfeoffed the knights with the juridisdiction (Gerichtsbarkeit) of the village and the logging rights (Holzgrafschaft) on the Vorholz, a low, heavily forested ridge near Hildesheim. In 1509 Heinrich von Saldern, father of the von Saldern brothers, signed a treaty with the Hildesheim bishop, John IV of Saxe-Lauenburg which pledged that the enfeoffment of Lauenstein and the Amt of Lauenstein (Salzhemmendorf) to the von Salderns, that had been in force since 1497, would not be revoked during the lifetime of Heinrich von Saldern. After his death, the fief would transfer exclusively to the episcopal administration. Hans von Saldern, vassal of the fortified house at Lutter am Barenberge had to vacate it against his will. Following his departure, the bishop provisioned his castles at Steuerwald and Peine with food and munitions as a precaution. In 1515, Burchard von Saldern took over the castle and Amt of Lauenstein from his father. That same year, however, Bishop John, dismissed the three sons of Heinrich von Saldern from the castle and Amt of Lauenstein. The brothers refused the order in view of the aforementioned treaty. They also demanded 3,000 guilders from the bishop to pay for their investment in fortifications, a demand which the bishop in turn refused to pay. Various negotiations followed that finally led, on 15 March 1518, to an arbitral decision by the estates (Landst√§nde) that Bishop John should pay the von Salderns for the cost of constructing the fortifications, but that the von Salderns had to leave the castle and Amt of Lauenstein by Easter. However, because Burchard refused to accept the repayment of the pledge sum (Pfandschilling), he was driven from the Lauenstein Castle that year and was replaced by Statius von M√ºnchhausen as the Hildesheim advocate (Vogt) at Lauenstein. After an unsuccessful attack on the castle, Burchard von Saldern, burned the castle hamlet (Burgflecken) of Lauenstein to the ground. In summer he nailed a letter to the castle gate with the words: \\"Borchert von Salder do bekand; dat ick hebbe jedan du√üen Brand; dat bekenne ick mit meiner Hand.\\" (\\"Burchard von Saldern makes known that I lit this fire; I confess this with my own hand\\"). Several fights ensued, the conflict eventually escalating into a statewide issue. On 5 July 1518 Burchard razed Schellerten. He also had Gronau set on fire by a hired servant and almost completely destroyed. In January 1519 the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud began. Following that, in 1523, Henneckenrode castle belonged to Brunswick. Henry of Saldern had the castle remodelled in 1579/80. In 1687, Adam Arnold von Bocholtz bought the Henneckenrode estate. In 1597, his son Burchard von Saldern (born 1568, died 29 December 1635), built the chapel in the castle courtyard. In 1613, before the onset of the Thirty Years' War, he had the Wilsnack hour bells cast for the Church of the Precious Blood in Bad Wilsnack, whose patron he was. His wives were Anna von Klitzing and Agnes von der Schulenburg. In 1552, the Brandenburg prince-elector, Joachim II had the water castle of Plattenburg in the Prignitz transferred to his Keeper of the Privy Purse (Oberstk√§mmerer), Matthias von Saldern, as a bequest and fief. The castle and its associated estates remained in the ownership of the family until 1945, when they were dispossessed. Around 1570, Kurt von Saldern built Nettlingen castle and sold it around 1611 to the Brewers' Guild in Hildesheim. Because of debts totalling 21,000 talers, Jacob and Heinrich von Saldern enfeoffed their family seat to Statius von M√ºnchhausen. In the 18th century, Caspar von Saldern was a civil servant and minister of state to Catharine II of Russia. At the time of King Frederick the Great, the lord of Saldern- Plattenburg was at odds with his cousin, the lord of Saldern-Wilsnack. The royal Prussian governor (Landrat), Gustav von Saldern-Plattenburg and his wife Thusnelda, n√©e Countess von Seherr-Tho√ü, had five children. The two eldest were Thusnelda and her twin sister, Agnes, who died at 14. Thusnelda inherited Meffersdorf Castle in Silesia, to which the family moved. From 1800 to 1850 the castle at Gro√ü Plasten was owned by Lieutenant von Saldern. In 1945 Sieghard von Saldern and his family fled before the Red Army to West Germany. Their estate at Plattenburg was divided up in the wake of the post-1945 land reform in the Soviet Occupation Zone. After 1990 his eldest son, Dietrich von Saldern, returned and founded a society with the aim of preserving the Plattenburg. The building was at that time the property of the municipality.

The background to this donation was the fact that the Old Grammar School (Alte Lateinschule) west of the church was not able to cope with the rising number of students. On the alienation of this property the Salder School was founded, named after her, and was housed in the former bishop's seat.

It gives a fictional account of the last days of Marie Antoinette in power seen through the eyes of Sidonie Laborde, a young servant who reads aloud to the queen. The film stars Diane Kruger as the Queen, L√©a Seydoux, and Virginie Ledoyen. It opened the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival in February 2012 and has subsequently been screened at other festivals. Its was released on 21 March 2012 in France. Plot In 1789, on the eve of the French Revolution, the court at the Palace of Versailles still live their routines, relatively unconcerned by the increasing turmoil in Paris a mere twenty miles away. The routines are seen through the eyes of the young Sidonie Laborde, who serves Queen Marie Antoinette. When news about the storming of the Bastille reaches the Court, most aristocrats and servants desert the Palace and abandon the Royal Family, fearing that the government is falling. But Sidonie, a true believer in the monarchy, refuses to flee. She feels secure under the protection of the Royal Family. She does not know these are the last three days she will spend by the Queen's side. The Queen orders Sidonie to disguise herself as Yolande Martine Gabrielle de Polastron, Duchess of Polignac, and serve as bait so that the latter can safely flee to Switzerland. This Sidonie does, despite a prior warning from one of the Queen's ladies in waiting. Sidonie is stripped naked and then redressed in a green gown. The coach carrying Sidonie is also occupied by the real Duchess and her husband, dressed as her servants. They treat her with disdain during the journey but she plays her role convincingly enough to enable the party to safely cross the border. As the film ends, she remarks that she has no connections other than her position as reader to the Queen, and soon she will be a nobody.

They adapted the script from the novel of the same name by Thomas. She won the Prix Femina for her book in 2002. After reading Chantal's feminist novel, Jacquot wanted to create a film from this perspective. The German actress Diane Kruger was cast as Marie Antoinette. Recognizing that many audience members had preconceptions of Marie Antoinette, Kruger approached the role by \\"trying not to judge her... We have the same origins, the same age. I could relate to her as a woman.\\" While the actress L√©a Seydoux is younger than the age of the lectrice character in the novel, Jacquot cast her as Laborde because \\"she brought this carnal dimension. She has incontrovertible sex appeal.\\" He also added to the plot the same-sex relationship between the Queen and duchess of Polignac; he thought it might be possible, given women's strong relationships with each other in that time period. Release Diane Kruger promoting the film at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival. The film opened the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival in February 2012. It was later shown at the San Francisco International Film Festival (19 April) and the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul International Film Festival (27 April) and as part of the L'Alliance Fran√ßaise French Film Festival, in Australia, in March 2013. Farewell, My Queen opened in theaters in France on 21 March 2012, and was released on a limited basis to American theaters on 13 July 2012. Reception Farewell, My Queen holds a rating of 67/100 on Metacritic. Several reviewers compared the film to Sofia Coppola's 2006 production, Marie Antoinette. IndieWire's Anne Thompson believed it was \\"an intimate and sexy period spectacle that takes us backstage at Versailles and into territory Sofia Coppola was not willing to go.\\" Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter called Farewell, My Queen a \\"visual joy, even while its tale of a lower class girl at court infatuated with the Queen of France labors to say something relevant. Though director Benoit Jacquot opts for the grand European style of Girl With a Pearl Earring rather than a modernist rereading √† la Sofia Coppola's post-punk vision Marie Antoinette, the film has its own charm, a matter-of-fact treatment of lesbianism and 'magnifique' costumes and settings guaranteed to please Upper East Side patrons, all of which suggests a wide art-house release for this lavish French-Spanish coprod.\\" Writing for The Independent, Geoffrey Macnab said that the director \\"doesn‚Äôt have any grand political statements to make. He is not trying to make a sweeping melodrama either. His approach is more like that of an anthropologist, studying a tribe in its death throes. The result is quietly fascinating.\\" Manohla Dargis of the New York Times describes Jacquot's film as a \\"tense, absorbing, pleasurably original look at three days in the life and lies of a doomed monarch...\\" Dargia, Manohla (12 July 2012). \\"As the Bastille Falls, Gossip in Versailles\\". The New York Times. Retrieved 20 August 2012. She suggests that Jacquot adopted his addition of the lesbian relationship from virulent political pamphlets of the time attacking the Queen. Justin Chang, the critic of Variety magazine wrote, \\"Benoit Jacquot's venom-tipped account of palatial intrigue and royal oblivion scrupulously maintains a servant's-eye view but winds up holding the viewer at an unrewarding distance. Cast names should lend the picture some Euro arthouse traction, though Stateside biz won't far exceed that of Jacquot's recent work.\\" While Chang criticized the characterization and depiction of Seydoux's character Sidonie Laborde, he praised Kruger's projection of \\"regal desperation\\" as well as Ledoyen's performance as the duchess.

Having taken his grandfather's name upon his accession to rulership, K ºan often combined it with his childhood name (Sak B ºaah Witzil [or Sak Witzil B ºaah]) in order to distinguish his inscriptions from those of his ancestor. He was a successor of his half-brother. The fact that his mother, Lady Batz º Ek º, was the more junior wife caused K ºan II to emphasize his royal legitimacy and his mother's importance in the text of Stela 3.

The Eurolight series was announced by Vossloh during 2009, the first examples were completed and commenced testing in the following year. The type has been intentionally developed to support use on secondary lines without limiting power or speed performances, making it suitable for mixed traffic operations. Specific versions of the Eurolight have been developed for the United Kingdom market, and a 6-axle Co'Co' machine for narrow gauge Asian markets, named UKLight and AsiaLight respectively. Furthermore, an electro- diesel locomotive derivative of the UKLight that shares much of its design, referred to as the Stadler Euro Dual, has also been developed and introduced during the late 2010s. Background and design  In 2009, Vossloh announced its intention to expand its diesel locomotive range to include further shunting/light mainline locomotives with either hydraulic or electric transmissions, and to produce a mainline diesel-electric locomotive (EURO Light) for markets where an axleload below 20 t is required. The four-axle EuroLight was designed to have a low axle load for use on cross-border operations on non-electrified European secondary routes, enabling operators to bypass bottlenecks on main corridors. It is reportedly suited for mixed- traffic operations, and can be outfitted to haul both passenger services and freight consists alike. The locomotive used numerous components from the 20‚Äì22 t axleload Vossloh Euro locomotive series. Differences include the adoption of a C175 engine from Caterpillar Inc. (12- or 16-cylinder of 2.3 or 2.8 MW) and traction equipment supplied by ABB Group. In comparison to the Vossloh Euro, a noticeable reduction in mass was achieved, which has been attributed to the adoption of a lighter engine/alternator set, as well as using lighter weight auxiliary system components. The bogie is the design used in the RENFE Class 334 locomotive, HTML text via findarticles.com with coil spring primary and secondary suspension. Wherever feasible, elements of the engine and traction system are composed of lighter aluminium rather than steel. For greater efficiency, the CAT engine has been furnished with electronically-regulated fuel injectors, enabling it to be precisely tuned to match the demands being placed on the engine at that time; factors taken into account include load, speed, engine temperature, ambient air temperature, and fuel temperature. For further fuel savings, automated stop-start technology has been incorporated to shut the engine down at times of inactivity and restart when required or to keep coolant temperatures above a set threshold; this behaviour can be manually overridden by the driver if desired. It is also equipped with turbochargers and after-cooling apparatus. The engine incorporates its own telemetry equipment, separate from the general system used by the locomotive; these systems aid in performance analysis and fault reporting. It is reportedly to be serviceable at trackside locations and requires a major service to be performed at intervals of 18,000 operating hours, reducing the need for the locomotive to return to the operator's depots. The CAT engine conform to European Stage IIIA emission standards, and can be modified to meet 2012 IIIB emission standards by replacing the exhaust silencer with a diesel particulate filter. Implementing such equipment in some regions can be complicated by the need to adhere to restrictive loading gauges, such as that predominantly used in the United Kingdom; accordingly extensive redesigning may be required. Both the engine and traction apparatus are frame mounted to reduce unsprung mass, being typically fitted using a five-point flexible mounting system, the mounting points of which being intentionally isolated. The ABB traction system uses a 6-pole brushless WGX560 synchronous alternator, which is directly coupled to the CAT engine. The alternator supplies two traction packages (ABB Bordline CC1500 DE Compact Converters. ), each with rectifier to create an intermediate DC supply, braking chopper, and drive electronics (AC800 PEC) with adhesion (anti slip) control controlling two traction inverters and one auxiliary inverter per package. There is one traction inverter per traction motor. The traction motors are rated at 600 kW at 4400 rpm. The drive electronics incorporate features such as fault condition detection and anti-slip control to maximise wheel adhesion to the rails, the latter being augmented by an automated sanding system. Head end power (for passenger versions) is taken from the intermediate DC link; the DC power system which is also used for dynamic braking. The braking systems typically used are a combination of rheostatic and disc brakes. The first EuroLight was unveiled at the InnoTrans trade fair in Berlin in 2010. From the onset, the design was designed to be customisable to customer requirements, allowing for a variants with a higher top speed, increased fuel capacity, or compatibility with limited loading gauges to be produced. Modified versions for broad and narrow gauge railways, and a long distance 7000l fuel capacity version are also said to be buildable. An electro-diesel locomotive derivative, referred to as the Stadler Euro Dual, has also been developed; it shares most of its design, such as the bodyshell, braking systems, bogies, traction equipment and software, with vehicles of the Stadler Eurolight series. Versions European mainland - EuroLight During early 2010, a pair of prototypes were constructed, numbered 248.001 and 248.002. That same year, 248.002 was publicly exhibited at Innotrans. Homologation tests with 248.001 in Germany began in January 2011. Performance data gathered from these prototypes was subsequently made available to prospective operators to aid in evaluating the EuroLight's capabilities. During July 2015, the Italian operator Dinazzano Po ordered a single unit; the locomotive performed its maiden fright service during Apil 2018.

Fischer (June 9, 1943 ‚Äì March 30, 2020) was an educator, author, and researcher in the field of neuroscience and education. Until his retirement in 2015, he was the Charles Bigelow Professor of Education and Director of the Mind, Brain, and Education Program at Harvard Graduate School of Education. Fischer studied cognitive and emotional development and learning. His work, called dynamic skill theory, is considered to be one of the Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development. It offers an explanation for both consistency and variability in developmental patterns. In later years, his focus was on the interdisciplinary field of Mind, Brain and Education. In the 1990s, Fischer with Howard Gardner and David Rose developed the Mind, Brain, and Education Program at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, which was the leading program in its area. A leader in his field, he was the founding president of the International Mind, Brain, and Education Society and founding editor of the journal Mind, Brain, and Education.

Musical career Nabin K Bhattarai started his musical career in 1990 with the band \\"The Steel Wheels\\" as the vocalist and rhythm guitarist for the band. After the band disbanded, he pursued a solo career. He was able to capture the attention of many Nepali music-lovers with his first released song Aankhama Timilai from the album Raharai Raharma which instantly made him a household name in Nepal. After the huge success of his first album, he has recorded eleven more albums from 1990 till date. His most recent album is Slok. Nabin K Bhattarai is considered to be the first real pop-star and unarguably one of the greatest pop singers of the country with an enormous fan following. He has won the Sajha Smriti Award for Best Male Vocalist on two occasions, first for Preetka Geet and then for Aankhama Timilai. He also won Album of the Year Award for Raharai Raharama. He further won the Shikhar Hits FM Music Awards 2054 (1997) on Best Male Vocal category for his hit single Sanjhapakha. He has also won the Chhinnalata Award, and at that time he was the youngest artist to receive that award.

He has also won several other awards and recognition afterwards. Some of his notable hits include Sanjhapakha', Timilai Ma Dobatoma, Timile Herda Kasailai, Timilai Bhetne, Chaina Joona', Yaad Le Timro and many others. As of 2011, he had been seen a lot in social works. Musical style Most of Nabin K Bhattarai's earlier songs have a melodic pop style to them, depicting the loneliness of a young lover. While his first four albums Raharai Raharma, Aabhas, Smriti, Samjhana, and Samarpan had the more melodic style, he began experimenting around his sixth album, Nabin. Many of his compositions after \\"Nabin\\" mostly include the elements of rock in them, which was positively received by the Nepali audience. In all his successive albums, he has tried to add a new musical element and contribute something different to the Nepali music industry. His song Ali Alikati Pida from the album G-Major was critically acclaimed by many for its folk and pop mix and the affluent use of musical instruments. He is known as the 'king of Nepali Pop'.

Despite its name, Robert Jenks estimates that ethnic Miao made up less than half of the uprising's participants.Jenks, 58-73 The uprising was preceded by Miao rebellions in 1735‚Äì36 and 1795‚Äì1806, and was one of many ethnic uprisings sweeping China in the 19th century. The rebellion spanned the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods of the Qing dynasty, and was eventually suppressed with military force. Estimates place the number of casualties as high as 4.9 million out of a total population of 7 million, though these figures are likely overstated. The rebellion stemmed from a variety of grievances, including long-standing ethnic tensions with Han Chinese, poor administration, grinding poverty and growing competition for arable land. The eruption of the Taiping Rebellion led the Qing government to increase taxation, and to simultaneously withdraw troops from the already restive region, thus allowing a rebellion to unfold. Millenarianism was an influence especially on the non-ethnic Miao participants.The New Way: Protestantism and the Hmong in Vietnam, By Tm T. T. Ng The aftermath of the rebellion causes many Miao, Hmong and other groups to migrate into Vietnam and Laos. The term \\"Miao\\", explains the anthropologist Norma Diamond, does not mean only the antecedents of today's Miao national minority; it is much more general term, which had been used by the Chinese to describe various aboriginal, mountain tribes of Guizhou and other southwestern provinces of China, which shared some cultural traits. They consisted of 40‚Äì60% population of the province. To date, the only English language account of the Miao Rebellion was written by Robert D. Jenks.Forward to the 1994 University of Hawaii press edition Most contemporary records from the uprising comes from Qing officials who were sent to quell the rebellion.

Career Early career Abdullah Atfeh began his military career at the Ottoman Military Academy in Istanbul. After his graduation in 1915, he served as an officer in the Ottoman Army. He defected in 1916 to join the Arab Revolt led by Sharif Hussein against the Ottomans. After the end of World War I and the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, Atfeh joined the newly created Syrian Army under King Faisal I. Following the defeat at Maysalun and the French occupation of Syria in 1920, the Syrian Army was dissolved and Atfeh fled to Jordan to avoid arrest. He returned in 1921 following a general amnesty. Atfeh joined the Army of the Levant, which was created by France, and received advanced military training at the √âcole Sup√©rieure de Guerre in 1938. Atfeh rose in the ranks and by World War II he became commander of Syria's coastal region. During the 1945 uprising in Damascus, Atfeh led his troops to mutiny against the French. Syrian Army The last French troops left Syria in 1946 and the country regained its independence. Syrian president Shukri al- Quwatli appointed Atfeh as chief of staff of the newly formed Syrian Army. The army was formed around the nucleus of the French-led Army of the Levant, and Atfeh was tasked with ensuring the allegiance of the army to the Syrian Republic. Atfeh continued his role as chief of staff when the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War broke out. Syrian troops suffered heavy losses during the first days of the war. Atfeh, along with Minister of Defense Ahmad al- Sharabati, were considered the principal parties responsible for the poor preparation and management of the war. Consequently, Atfeh was relieved from his duties soon after and replaced with then-Director of Public Security, Husni al-Za'im. In 1949, al-Za'im led a military coup that overthrew the al- Quwatli's government, and appointed Atfeh as his defense minister. Al-Za'im's rule lasted around five months, and in August 1949 Atfeh switched his allegiances again and supported the politicians that replaced him. After the 1949 elections Atfeh was appointed minister of defense by Syria's new president, Hashim al-Atassi. However, his term did not last long and he was relieved from his post after three months, after which he retired from public life.

Her dog handler, McClure Halley, was sent to Europe to find the best dog he could, and returned with Ferry to Dodge's surprise as she was not expecting a Doberman Pinscher. He arrived in the USA just before the 1939 Westminster show and was promptly entered in it. He won his breed, and the Working Group, qualifying him for the Best in Show round where he faced a Cocker Spaniel, a Beagle, a Smooth Fox Terrier, a Yorkshire Terrier and a Standard Poodle. He won the title, and went on to win a further twelve Best in Shows out of the thirteen shows he entered whilst in Dodge's ownership. These wins included the International Kennel Club of Chicago Dog Show, and the Rochester Kennel Club show. He was not entered in Westminster in the following year. Issues with Ferry's temperament were noted, and reported his Westminster Best in Show judge could not touch him. His second place showing was at the Chicago show in 1940, being beaten by the English Setter Maro of Maridor in the Best in Show round. Dodge announced Ferry's retirement and sold him to L. R. \\"Jim\\" Randle, from San Francisco, to replace his dog Ch. Jockel v Burgund. He was given to handler Russell Zimmerman to show him in conformation shows throughout the Western United States. When Zimmerman was unavailable, Ben Brown would handle him. Reportedly Ferry attempted to intimidate Brown by charging at him when he let him out of the crate on the first occasion. After shutting the crate door in Ferry's face three times, he and Brown became good friends and Brown described him as one of the best dogs he ever handled. Ferry changed handlers on several more occasions until he was in the hands of Harold Duffy. He was found in Duffy's kennels dead at the age of six and a half, a necropsy reported that he had been beaten to death. Legacy He was used at stud several times while in the Western United States, producing litters for several kennels. One such Kennel was Rancho Dobe, and Ferry's grandson Ch. Rancho Dobe's Storm went on to win Best in Show twice at the Westminster Show, one of only eight dogs to have done so.

Biography Early life Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Clarence was the son of a German immigrant father, Richard Hatzfeld and an American-born mother, Emma Drake Hatzfeld. When he was a child, Hatzfeld's family moved to Chicago and his father, who was a pharmacist, soon opened a drug store in Lakeview on the city's North Side. After attending college, Hatzfeld's early architectural training was \\"largely in the office of the late Julius Huber.\\"Illinois Society of Architects Monthly Bulletin, Oct/Nov, 1943, v. 28, no 4-5, p. 8. Son of architect John Paul Huber, Julius Huber was a locally prominent architect who designed many residences in Chicago's Edgewater neighborhood.Julia S. Bachrach, National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for the Theodore Rozek House, July 8, 2011, available on-line at http://www.illinoishistory.gov/PS/IHSAC/nominated/Theodore%20Rozek%20House.pdf Hatzfeld worked for Julius Huber for several years, was promoted to partner in 1899, and the firm became known as Julius Huber & Co.LeRoy Blommaert, \\"Julius Huber: Edgewater Architect\\" Edgewater Historical Society Newsletter, v. XIV, n. 3, 2003. During this period, Hatzfeld became an active member of the Chicago Architectural Club, where he became acquainted with \\"many aspiring designers who would make important contributions to the burgeoning Prairie style of architecture including Henry Webster Tomlinson, Hermann von Holst, Birch Burdette Long, Robert Spencer Jr., Irving K. Pond, and Dwight Heald Perkins.\\" In 1901, Hatzfeld left Huber's firm to work as a draftsman for the Chicago Board of Education, first under head architect William B. Mundie, and later under Dwight Heald Perkins, with whom he was already acquainted through the Chicago Architectural Club. Under Perkins's leadership, a large collection of earth-toned brick Chicago Public School buildings were constructed with simple terra cotta details conveying his own distinct expression of the Prairie style. Among them are Carl Schurz, Cleveland, and Tilton schools. Hatzfeld was married to Laurette Haentze (who went by Laura), a music teacher and daughter of a prominent German family who helped Clarence in his career. He was permitted by the Board of Education to accept private commissions, and both Hatzfeld's father-in-law, Richard Haentze, and brother-in-law, Albert Haentze, hired him to design buildings for their real estate ventures. Albert and partner Charles M. Wheeler developed residences on the city's Northwest side, and Hatzfeld designed many properties for them, including more than a dozen for the landmark Villa District which advertised and that every home was \\"a little gem of beauty and comfort.\\" Hatzfeld produced plans for a number of these after forming partnership with another Board of Education architect, Arthur Knox, in 1905. In 1913, Chicago's Irving Park District hired Hatzfeld & Knox to design the Independence Park field house. This represented the first of approximately twenty park buildings that Hatzfeld produced in Chicago. The building \\"conveys a strong feeling of classicism through its monumentality, symmetrical layout and broad arched openings. A sense of the Prairie style is also expressed through its long horizontal outer wings, broad tiled roofs with bracketed overhanging eaves, rich brick pattern-work, and large shallow concrete urns that were originally located at both entrances to the building.\\" It combined features of earlier field houses that were meant to provide services to poor immigrant neighborhoods and those of private athletic clubs. For instance, it had a branch of the Chicago Public Library and an indoor swimming pool.Julia S. Bachrach, National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for Independence Park, June 16, 2008. Between the late 1920s and mid 1930s, Hatzfeld designed many other field houses including those in: Athletic Field, Avondale, Gladstone, Kilbourn, Thomas Jefferson, Hollywood Park, Indian Boundary, Gladstone, Green Briar, Euguene Field, Portage, Paul Revere, and River Parks. Hatzfeld & Knox dissolved in 1915. Along with park field houses, Masonic Temples also became one of Hatzfeld's specialties. \\"These tended to be large brick structures with heavy rectangular massing and well-detail facades.\\" For many of such lodges, Hatzfeld created fanciful interiors, often relying on specific themes for each room. For instance, his 1921 Logan Square Masonic Temple (now the Armitage Baptist Church) originally had a Pompeian Ball Room, American Hall, Ionian Lounge, Norman Hall, and the Egyptian Ball Room. Hatzfeld's Masonic Temples include the Des Plaines Masonic Hall (now Stage One Theatre), and the South Side Masonic Temple, and Myrtle Masonic Temple (now Korean Bethel Presbyterian Church) which are both extant in Chicago. In addition to these projects, Hatzfeld also designed the Immel State Bank at 2800 W Belmont Ave.Chicago Public Library, \\"Hatzfeld Papers\\" Later life and death Hatzfeld's business dwindled during the Great Depression, and after closing his architectural office, he was hired by the Chicago Park District in 1935 as Recreation Plants and Equipment Technician. He was forced into mandatory retirement in 1939, and then moved to Washington DC to accept the position of Recreation Technician for the Federal Works Administration. Clarence Hatzfeld died in Washington, D.C. in 1943.

It is located near the town of Vyshny Volochyok Tver Province, in a picturesque location on the banks of Msta River and Lake Mstino. In a broader sense the Akademicheskaya Dacha (or \\"Akademichka\\") refers to the entire surrounding area including villages of Bolshoy Gorodok, Maliy Gorodok, Kisharino, Terpigorevo, Valentinovka and Podol, where many Russian artists resided in the mid-second half of the 20th century.  History  A view of frozen Msta River from the Dacha The Akademicheskaya Dacha was opened on July 22, 1884, as a place of summer practice for poor students of the Imperial Academy of Arts. A plot of land with the park, house and buildings had been taken on lease by the Academy of Arts from the Ministry of Railways. It was originally named as \\"Vladimir and Maria shelter\\" in honor of Grand Duke Vladimir, president of the Imperial Academy of Arts, and his wife Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna and the Empress Maria Alexandrovna. The exceptional role in Dacha's organization were the \\"Academic cottages\\" belonging to her guardian (1817‚Äì1889), a major industrialist, and the owner of one of the largest collections of Russian and Western European art. Before the October Revolution of 1917, many famous Russian artists worked on the Akademicheskaya Dacha, including Ilya Repin, Nikolay Bogdanov-Belsky, Pavel Chistyakov, Arkhip Kuindzhi, Isaac Levitan, Andrei Ryabushkin, Nicholas Roerich and Valentin Serov. After 1917 the house was given to the children for an open summer camp. Its artistic purpose was restored only in 1948. Since that time the Dacha has become one of the recognized centers of creative life in the Soviet Union and Russia. In those years here worked Russian painters Aleksei Gritsai, Vecheslav Zagonek, Dmitry Maevsky, Maya Kopitseva, Fyodor Reshetnikov, Nikolai Pozdneev, Nikolai Timkov, and many others. It is no accident, noting the role of the Akademicheskaya Dacha in preserving and promoting the traditions of Russian realistic Art, that it is called the \\"Russian Barbizon\\". The best art works of landscape and genre painting, exhibited in Art Shows of 1960s-1980s, were created primarily on the Dacha and its surroundings. Later in the 1970s-1980s, modern workshops and office buildings were built, providing year-round use of the Dacha for artistic purposes. In 1964, the Akademicheskaya Dacha was named after the famous Russian painter Ilya Repin. In 1974, near the main pavilion a monument to Ilya Repin was erected, designed by sculptor Oleg Komov and architect Nikolai Komov, in honor of the 130th anniversary of the artist's birth. In 2004, during celebration of the 120th anniversary of the Akademicheskaya Dacha, a plaque in memory of Vasily Kokorev was open at the main pavilion building.

At the 2011 census, there were about 27,355 people of Latvian descent in Canada.  History  Although by 1921 the Canadian government considered all persons from the Baltic provinces to be Russians, it is known that there were some Latvians living in Canada in those years, because in 1961, 379 Latvian indicated that they had arrived in Canada prior to 1921, and most probably left Latvia after the 1905 Revolution. Between 1921 and 1945, 409 Latvians arrived to Canada, although in the 1941 census listed 975 people claimed Latvian origin. After the Second World War in 1947, many Latvians moved to Canada as war refugees. This migration, which accounted for 92% of Latvians who immigrated to the country between 1921 and 1965, ended in 1957. Many of these Latvians worked in the agricultural areas during their first years in Canada, but soon settled in cities. By 1961, only 10% of those immigrants lived in rural zones and farms (6% in rural areas and 4% on farms). The majority of Latvian immigrants in Canada in 1991 were women, 775 more women than men.

By 1991, 20,445 persons indicated they were of Latvian descent, most of them living in the capital, 14 percent in the prairie provinces, 12 percent in British Columbia, 5.9 percent in Quebec, and 1.8 percent in the Atlantic region. In 1991 the largest populations of Latvian Canadians are in Toronto, Vancouver, Hamilton, Ottawa, and Montreal, Quebec.  Religion  Most Latvian Canadians are Christians: close to 90 percent are Lutheran, 10 percent Roman Catholic, and 1 percent Baptist. The organization of Lutheran congregations in Canada is in regional dioceses, which belong to the Lutheran Evangelical Church in Exile. In 1970 there were 1,400 Latvian-Canadian Roman Catholics.

It operated from 1903 to 1933 using a third rail and had no grade crossings. It was approximately thirty miles long and had one tunnel between Warrior Run and Nuangola through Penobscot Knob which Interstate 81 now crosses. Prominent Hazleton banker and coal-mine owner Alvan Markle obtained a railway-company charter in 1892 and the Wilkes-Barre & Hazleton Railroad incorporated in New Jersey in 1899. Service opened from Hazleton to Ashley in 1903 but did not reach Wilkes-Barre until the 1907 completion of a 3rd-floor downtown station with a viaduct 34 feet in height and 1040 feet in length. General Electric had the contract for providing the electrification infrastructure. The completion of Route 309 greatly shortened the trip between Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton by road, leading to the Interstate Commerce Commission approval of abandonment in 1933. The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railroad allowed faster travel between Hazleton and Wilkes-Barre than the 50-mile journey along the Lehigh Valley Railroad that was used previously. The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway consisted of 24.76 miles of railway line for the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway Company, 3.3 miles of railway line for the Wilkes-Barre Terminal Railroad Company, and 1.64 miles of railway line for the Lehigh Traction Company. This totalled to 29.70 miles of railway line. History and operation A completed order of cars for the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway Co. The charter for the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railroad was granted on November 7, 1892. The railroad was incorporated in New Jersey in 1899. The railroad obtained a New Jersey charter on May 8, 1901. The railroad's power, generating station, sub-stations, and transmission lines were designed by the General Electric Company. In 1921, the Pennsylvania Power and Light company started to do the job of powering the railroad instead, as part of an attempt for the railroad to reduce its expenses. The railroad stopped bringing in profit in the middle of the 1920s. The railroad company defaulted its bonds in 1929. Henry S. Drikard, a businessman from Philadelphia, bought the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton railroad company for $165,000 in February 1930. Briefly in 1932, several railbusses were used on the railroad. All service on the railroad stopped on September 17, 1933, following a ruling from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, and power to the rail line was removed on October 3, 1933, after a final attempt to save the railroad from bankruptcy. Construction of the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railroad started in 1901. Nine railroad bridges were required for the construction of the railroad. Most of the bridges were made of concrete, but some of the largest ones were not. The grade of the railroad on hills was 3%. The rails used weighed 95 pounds per yard. These rails were 30 feet (9 meters) long and on top of 8-inch by 6-inch ties. The ties for the third rails were 9 feet (3 meters) long. Wooden cars were used until 1916, when they were replaced by steel cars. The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railroad opened for business in 1903. However, at that time it only ran from Hazleton to Ashley. In 1907, trains began running all the way to Wilkes-Barre via a 1040-foot long viaduct that was 34 feet (10 meters) high over the steam railroads of Wilkes- Barre. The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railroad ran freight trains and passenger trains alternately. The railroad started operation at 6 a.m. and stopped operation at 2 a.m. Course The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railroad started in Hazleton and ran to West Hazleton on tracks belonging to the Lehigh Traction Company. From there, it went past Conyngham Gap, Butler Mountain, and Buck Mountain, before going down into the valley of Nescopeck Creek. Upon leaving the Nescopeck Creek valley, it went up Nescopeck Mountain via Nescopeck Pass, then descended into the valley of Big Wapwallopen Creek. Upon leaving the Big Wapwallopen Creek valley, the railroad went up Penobscot Mountain, tunneling through it at 1300 feet above sea level. The route then went down the mountain and past Sugar Gap and Solomon Creek to the community of Ashley. There the railroad connected to the tracks of the Wilkes-Barre Traction Company. The route was 26 miles long, but was later extended into downtown Wilkes-Barre via Georgetown. In Nuangola, a sub-station was built to supply the third rail of the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railroad with 625 volts. An additional sub station is in Georgetown, and the main power house was located at St. Johns, Pa. The crossing of the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway over Black Creek is a very large three-arch viaduct made of stone. Slightly over two miles north of the railroad's southern terminus, there is an interchange to the Lehigh Valley Railroad. This interchange is known as Oak Bur. The railroad also featured a horseshoe curve near Kis-Lyn. The railroad's Beisel Station was between 7.25 and 8.5 miles north of the southern terminus. Another station on the route was St. John's Station in the community of St. Johns. The railroad also had a station at the community of Blytheburn. The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Turnpike passed close to the railroad near the Yeager farms. There was a spur that goes towards the Ice Ponds. Financial information and leaders The initial officers of the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railroad were A. Markle, J.B. Price (the vice-president), E.S. Doud (the secretary), and N.C. Yost (the treasurer). The initial directors of the railroad were K.K. McLauren, A. Markle, W.B. Given, E.R. Payne, J.B. Price, A.A. Sterling, and Benjamin Reynolds. Two of Alvan Markle's sons, Alvan Markle Jr. and E.B. Markle, also held positions in the railway company. Alvan Markle Jr. joined the company in 1922 and became secretary and treasurer. E.B. Markle became the general manager, but took his father's position in 1928. Uses When the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway was first opened, traffic along it mostly consisted of traffic going between Hazleton and Wilkes-Barre, although occasionally passengers got on at intermediate points. However, after the railroad was constructed, and due to its construction, some businesses began operation near the Pine View Ice Lakes along the route. The railroad also improved business for farmers near the community of Albert, who were able to send their milk to creameries in Hazleton. It also provided electricity for communities along the route. Additionally it transported materials for the mining industry, such as timber props, wedges, and sprags to Nuangola. The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway provided an easy way for hunters, fishermen, and sportsmen to access the mountainous countryside between Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton. Common places that such people frequented along the route included Nuangola Lake, Pine View Lake, and Lake Blytheburn. These areas gradually developed into villages. chickens were once exported from the railroad's Nuangola station. Another use of the railway was to carry passengers from Hazleton to the Luzerne County Courthouse. Controversies and accidents In 1907, a train running along the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway northward went off the tracks and crashed into a forest, catching fire. Several people were seriously injured during this event. This was the first accident on the railroad, but not the only one. Another accident occurred on one early afternoon when two interurban trains going in opposite directions on the railroad collided, causing a fire (due to broken electrical wiring), several serious injuries, and one death. This accident was primarily due to one of the trains leaving its station at an abnormal time. Another accident occurred near the Yeager farms, where a car fell from the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Turnpike and got hit by a train, which killed the car's seven passengers. In 1933, there were two train wrecks on the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway. The termination of use of the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway drew numerous protests from long-term users of the railroad. Records and legacy The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railroad was the earliest railroad to have a guarded third rail (guarding a third rail is done to protect it from the weather). It was also one of the first interurban railroads to have no grade crossings and a fenced, private right-of-way. A road called Henry Drive was later built on the old railroad bed. Parts of the line in Hazleton Pa are still used by the present Norfolk Southern Ry. to serve the Valmont industrial Park, including the Black Creek viaduct.

Plot  While making out on the beach, a couple is attacked by a blade-wielding man dressed like a hippie. After beheading the man with a machete, the hippie slashes the woman to death with a dagger, then sexually assaults her corpse. Charged with solving \\"the Lake Front Butcher\\" murders (as the media have dubbed them) are Sergeant Connor and Detective Haller, whose main suspect is the man who found the bodies, a retired army colonel named Peter Wayne. Routinely intruding upon the investigation is stubborn local reporter Susan Rather, the occasional lover of Assistant District Attorney Ralph Kennedy. Over the next two nights two more couples are butchered, one in their van, and the other in an abandoned factory. The modus operandi (male killed with a machete, the female killed with a knife and raped post-mortem) is the same, and the theory that Wayne is the killer is strengthened when he goes into hiding. Shortly after another couple is killed (this time in their bedroom) on the fourth night, Connor finds Wayne, who he had discovered had lived in at least two of the four cities where similar crimes (five couples killed over the course of five nights, each spree five years apart) have occurred. However, due to a lack of solid evidence connecting him to any of the murders, Wayne (who claims to have only hid because he believed Connor was personally out to get him) is let go. After Wayne's release, Connor and Haller are approached by Susan, who claims that Ralph is the Lake Front Butcher. Susan explains that she had earlier snuck into the station to look through the case files, and found out that the ex- boyfriend of the very first victim (murdered twenty years ago in Massachusetts alongside her lover) was named Joseph Ralph Dwyer, which is Ralph's birth name. Searching for Ralph, the trio track him down to the abandoned factory, where he is killed in a shootout, though only after claiming the lives of another young couple, completing his pattern for the fifth time.

Trash Film Guru found the film enjoyable, despite the low productions values, abysmal acting, and occasional dullness. Critical Condition said that while 555 was by no means good, it did have decent acting, and gore effects. A score of one and half (\\"Bad\\") was given by The Bloody Pit of Horror, which said the film was highly inept on a technical level, and suffered from obnoxious characters, bad dialogue and acting, a pedestrian and ridiculous mystery, a silly plot, and a limp finale. The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre found the acting weak and the plot formulaic, and stated the only memorable aspect of the film was two or three over-the-top splatter scenes. The Video Graveyard categorized the film as garbage with lame gore and amateurish acting, though the website admitted that the \\"compellingly awful indie effort\\" is worth watching once by bad movie enthusiasts. Video Junkie Strikes Back from the Grave quipped \\"The only thing going for 555 is the effects work, which is suitably gory\\". Soiled Sinema summed up 555 as a \\"complete piece of zombie shit\\" that offered only a minimal amount of entertainment.  Home media  It was originally released on VHS in 1988 by Slaughterhouse Entertainment (Wally Koz's distribution company) However, VHS prints of the film have become collector's items due to their limited quantities. VHS copies of the film have been spotted on eBay with extremely high prices (such as one copy selling for $350.00). In 2011, Massacre Video released the film for the first time on DVD. It includes special features such as interviews with actor Scott Hermes, special effects artist Jeffrey Lyle Segal, and a slideshow of behind the scenes photos.

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the mixtape received an average score of 70, based on 12 reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone gave the mixtape three and a half stars out of five, saying \\"Rich Forever is a mixtape that plays like an album, with blaring, heraldic production by the likes of Boi-1da and up-and-comer Beat Billionaire, plus guest appearances by Drake, Nas and Diddy.\\" Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club gave the mixtape a B+, saying \\"Rich Forever meets a standard of quality control that‚Äôs rare for albums, let alone mixtapes: 18 new songs, all of them good, many of them exhilarating‚Äîchief among them the exultant ‚ÄúKeys To The Crib,‚Äù and ‚ÄúTriple Beam Dreams,‚Äù a courtroom drama featuring an elaborate Nas verse that‚Äôs downright Illmatic-worthy. It‚Äôs a big project, but it never drags, overreaches, or stumbles; Ross rhymes throughout with so much power and economy that it just keeps barreling forward. If he can sustain this remarkable stride, Ross could probably pull off a double album if he wanted to.\\" Mike Madden of Consequence of Sound gave the mixtape three out of five stars, saying \\"Rich Forever doesn‚Äòt boast any potential mega-hits. But that‚Äôs actually a good reason to give this a spin; the songs here are strong without shooting for the stars, hopefully because Ross is saving that kind of stuff for God Forgives. Consider this a rousing sneak-peek to what could be rap‚Äôs biggest event-album of 2012.\\" Jordan Sargent of Pitchfork gave the mixtape an 8.2 out of 10, saying \\"Rich Forever adds vindictive muscle to a motto that at one point might have come off as a hollow attempt at branding. It's a record that uses nastiness to cement the character \\"Rick Ross\\" as three-dimensional, and uses a barrage of bangers to cement the rapper Rick Ross as an undeniable force.\\" David Amidon of PopMatters gave the mixtape a five out of ten, saying \\"Rich Forever is Ross at his most emotionally basic, and therefore, anyone choosing to take its journey should be willing to admit it‚Äôs mainly for the aesthetic quality of his bearded husk grunting over some of the crispiest production you‚Äôre likely to hear in 2012, even if the sum of those parts is somewhat unremarkable most of the time.\\" Carl Chery of XXL gave the mixtape an XL, saying \\"With Rich Forever, Ross continues to cement his position as one of hip-hop‚Äôs best artists.

And if Ross is simply giving away music of this caliber, Lord knows he‚Äôll be taking it up a few notches with his next commercial release.\\" Jonathan Witz of AllHipHop gave the mixtape an eight out of ten, saying \\"Overall, Rich Forever is good enough to be an album, which ends up raising the bar as well as fan expectations for Ross‚Äôs delayed and much-anticipated upcoming LP. The entire process of releasing the Rich Forever tape generated a huge amount of buzz for the album as Ross had likely planned. Now, all he has to do is fulfill even higher expectations on God Forgives, I Don‚Äôt and continue to lead the way for his Maybach Music Group in 2012.\\" Pedro Hernandez of RapReviews gave the mixtape a five out of ten, saying \\"Though I doubt these songs will have much in the form of lasting impact on anyone, for a weekend of partying or long car drive to work there certainly is enough to warrant a download.

The magazine was founded in New York City in 1890 and, since the mid-1970s, has been based in Englewood, New Jersey. The Music Trades is one of the longest-running, without interruption, trade publications in the world. The issue ‚Äî Vol. , No. ‚Äî is approximately the issue. A controlling ownership over the last years ‚Äî percent of the publication's total age ‚Äî has been held by three generations of the Majeski family, making it among the few current publications of any ilk that has been closely held by a single family for as long a period.  History  The Music Trades was founded in 1890 by John Christian Freund (1848‚Äì1924) and Milton Weil (1871‚Äì1935). Freund and Weil also, in 1898, founded Musical America, the oldest American magazine on classical music. John Christian Freund Freund, who matriculated in 1868 at Exeter College, Oxford but left after three years without a degree, had first been a playwright and actor. Freund emigrated to New York in 1871. In 1875, he founded The Music Trade Review, a fortnightly publication that he later renamed The Musical and Dramatic Times and Music Trade Review. The publication ran for about 2 years. In 1878, Freund founded the Musical Times, which soon changed to Musical and Dramatic Times. On January 7, 1882, Freund launched a weekly magazine, Music: A Review (Vol., No. 1), which contained an insert called The Music Trade. Sometime on or before July 8, 1882, Freund changed the name to Music and Drama, supplemented by Freund's Daily Music and Drama. Music and Drama evolved into the weekly publication, The Music Trades. In 1884, Freund, with John Travis Quigg (1839‚Äì1893), founded The American Musician, which ran until 1891 and became the official publication of the National League of Musicians, the forerunner of the American Federation of Musicians. Before founding the American Musician, Henry Cood Watson (1818‚Äì1875) began in 1864 the publication Watson's Art Journal, devoted to music criticism and trade. Watson died in 1875 and his Journal was taken over by his pupil, William M. Thoms, who improved it, renamed it American Art Journal, edited it until his retirement in 1906, then, upon his retirement, merged it with the American Musician. Around 1895, Freund's younger brother, Harry Edward Freund (1863‚Äì1950), was editor of Musical Weekly, which continued as a weekly with a new name, beginning January 1896, as The Musical Age. The publication was aimed at piano dealers. Milton Weil, 1926 (photo courtesy of The Music Trades Corporation) 1927 sale by Milton Weil Milton Weil (1871‚Äì1935) was married to the actress Henrietta Lander (n√©e Rich; 1874‚Äì1935). On June 13, 1927, three years after Freund died, Weil sold The Music Trades and Musical America to a newly formed syndicate that acquired four other publications and consolidated them into Trade Publications, Inc., headed by Walter Crawford Howey (1882‚Äì1954) as president, Verne Hardin Porter (1888‚Äì1942) as vice president and secretary, and Edwin John Rosencrans (1870‚Äì1935), as treasurer. The other publications were The American Architect, The Barbers' Journal, Beauty Culture, and Perfumers' Journal. Schluter & Company and Shields & Company were the investment bankers who handled the deal, which involved an issuance of $1,100,000 in preferred and common stock. Howey, Porter, and Rosencrans were also directors of Trade Publications, Inc. The other directors were G. Murray Hulbert, John Zollikoffer Lowe, Jr. (1884‚Äì1951), and Joseph Urban. Shields & Company and Nixon & Company, of Philadelphia, also made s public offering of ten-year percent gold bonds of Trade Publications, Inc., that carried warrants to purchase common stock at a price that closely corresponded with the value of the stock. Howey and Porter had been former executives of the Hearst Corporation. Rosencrans was the managing editor of The American Architect. Years before the deal, Rosencrans, a civil engineer, had been partners with architect John F. Jackson (1867‚Äì1948). Their firm, Jackson & Rosencrans, designed over seventy YMCAs. Lowe was a lawyer and onetime law partner in a firm with Samuel Seabury. 1929 bankruptcy Henrietta Lander, 1888 Walter Howey ‚Äî who, before heading Trade Publications, had been the founding managing editor of the New York Daily Mirror ‚Äî left Trade Publications to again become the managing editor of the Mirror on August 1, 1928. Trade Publications, Inc., filed for bankruptcy in 1929. The Irving Trust Co. was appointed receiver for Trade Publications, Inc., which had liabilities of $716,839 and assets of $59,511. John Logan Lyttle (1879‚Äì1930), bankruptcy referee, sold at auction to John Majeski, Weil's former assistant, on July 19, 1929, four of the six magazines for $45,200: (i) Musical America, (ii) The Music Trades, (iii) The Barbers' Journal, and (iv) Beauty Culture. Of the $45,000 Majeski paid for the six publications, $11,000 of it was attributable to Musical America and The Music Trades, for which, three years earlier, around 1926‚Äì1927, he had offered a quarter of a million dollars, in a losing bid against Trade Publications, Inc. Majeski's acquisition included the publications' names, a collection of back issues, and a few months of office space in the Steinway Building. A few months before the bankruptcy auction on July 19, 1929, Weil was said to have sold all his interest in Trade Publications, Inc., for $200,000 in preferred stock. After he sold, he and his wife moved to Paris, where they were residing during the bankruptcy auction. The bankruptcy sale wiped-out Weil's stake built-up over a lifetime. Weil, at the time of the bankruptcy sale, was said to have only taken $5,000 with him to Paris. Weil's father, Jacob A. Weil (1835‚Äì1913), was a Paris-born American and his mother, Dina (n√©e Lilienthal; born 1843), was a German-born American. Double suicide of Milton and Henrietta Weil Hotel Scribe, Paris, 2011 Distraught over the loss of their fortune during the pre-Crash of 1929, then the Crash, and their subsequent inability to recover during the Great Depression ‚Äì Milton and Henrietta Weil carried out a double suicide pact on May 22, 1935, leaving a note and taking veronal in their room of the Hotel Scribe in the Opera District of Paris. Henrietta died the next morning, May 23, 7:40 at the American Hospital; Milton died 23 hours and 25 minutes later, May 24, 7:05 , at the same hospital. They are buried next to each other at the New Cemetery of Neuilly-sur-Seine. Legacy of Freund and Weil : Freund and Weil were exponents of American classical music, despite the fact that Freund had only become a naturalized United States citizen on November 2, 1903. Their publications Musical America and The Music Trades complemented each other, and, in a unique sense, gave them a comprehensive and credible view of the growth of classical music in America and its international rank, as an art-form and in commerce. To the extent that both publications reached an international readership, Freund and Weil held sway as impresarios and movement leaders of American classical music. Their publications flourished during the early 1900s ‚Äî on a new wave of American composers, including those of the Second New England School ‚Äî joined by foreign composers that emigrated to America after 1880 in a flood of nearly 25 million Europeans. In commerce, 1875 to 1932 represented a golden age of piano making ‚Äî nearly 364,545 were sold at the peak in 1909, according to the National Piano Manufacturers Association. New York City, followed by Chicago, was the manufacturing leader of pianos during that age. Freund and Weil's publications gave them broad access in the field of music. Notably, they served as bridges between the art and the money, connecting artists, organizations, commerce, and public policy. The spectrum that both publications collectively chronicled gave Freund and Weil a strong platform to serve as advocates, opinion leaders, conciliators, counselors, arbiters, and ambassadors for music and the music trades in America. As an example, Freund and Weil were influential in the founding of the National Music Managers Association (for national managers) and the National Concert Managers' Association (for local managers), aimed at improving cooperation between the two for the benefit of musicians. Also, Freund and Weil were, in 1918, the founding president and secretary-treasurer, respectively, of the Musical Alliance of the United States, an organization that endures today. At its founding, Freund had called for an alliance to organize \\"all workers in the field, from the man at the bench in a piano factory to the conductor of the great symphony.\\" The Majeski years ‚Äî 1910‚Äìpresent John F. Majeski, Sr., 1926 (photo courtesy of The Music Trades Corporation) On July 19, 1929, John Francis Majeski, Sr. (1892‚Äì1971) ‚Äî who in 1910 had joined the staff of Musical America, which at the time owned The Musical Trades ‚Äî became the new owner of (i) The Music Trades, (ii) Musical America, (ii) Barbers Journal, and (iv) Beauty Culture. On August 22, 1929, Majeski formed three holding companies: The Music Trades Corporation, The Musical America Corporation, and Beauty Culture Publishing Corporation ‚Äî the third as holding company for Barbers Journal and Beauty Culture. In 1959, Majeski sold Musical America ‚Äî which later merged with High Fidelity in 1964 ‚Äî but retained his interest in The Musical Trades, and served as its publisher until his death.

In it, he lauds The Music Trades as \\"one of the foremost publications which may be classed as a trade journal,\\" and proceeds to examine a particular issue ‚Äî Vol. 58, No. 25, December 20, 1919. Botsford points out that the articles in the issue are diverse, but at first glance, seemingly not relevant for a lack of direct connections to the music field. Yet he sees how topics of other sectors and industries ‚Äî and commerce as a whole ‚Äî relate to music commerce. Botsford stated that the articles, all of them, were interesting and well-written; but averred that each writing assignment might have been better-filled by \\"a live writer in the field, if said writer would have used his brain.\\" Botsford, a trade writer himself, seemed to be challenging his profession to exercise more interdisciplinarity writing. Referring to Secor's article, Botsford posed the question, \\"Why couldn't some of we fellows who write for farm papers have thought of the idea? Have we been overlooking possibilities?\\" The December 20, 1919, issue, as a whole, bears some similarities to some of the special macro-economic issues of the 21st- century.

Nixon and David Berkowitz. He was the father of Inger McCabe Elliott.https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/business/media/29elliott.htmlhttps://www.dn.no/d2/2018/07/11/1057/Profil/fra- uranienborg-til-new-yorks- elitehttps://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/21/archives/osborn-elliot-newsweek-chief- exeeutive-weds-mrs-inner-mccabe.html Early life and education Abrahamsen was born in Trondheim, Norway in 1903. He studied medical science at the Royal Frederick University in Oslo and was graduated in 1929. He eventually relocated to England, taking positions at the Tavistock Clinic and the London School of Economics. He moved to the United States in 1940 and joined the staff at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, D.C. Later he served as a psychiatrist and criminal psychopathologist at two major prisons in the U.S., first the Illinois State Penitentiary in Joliet, and then the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining, New York. He also worked for the New York State Psychiatric Institute at Columbia University, and served as a teacher and research associate at Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons. Writing career Abrahamsen belonged to one of the oldest families of Jewish settlers in Norway, and his heritage informed the writing of his first book, I Am a Jew, which described and compared the traditional Norwegian and Jewish ways of life. Abrahamsen's paper, A Study of Lee Harvey Oswald: Psychological Capability of Murder, was published in the Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine, in October 1967. His book, Our Violent Society, came out in 1970, a Funk & Wagnalls' publication.The Murdering Mind, David Abrahamsen, Harper & Row, 1973, 21. Abrahamsen's expertise in psychopathology was enlisted by authorities during the notorious Son of Sam serial murder case: when the killer, David Berkowitz, was finally in custody, Abrahamsen was directed by the Brooklyn District Attorney to evaluate his ability to stand trial. He deemed him competent, but Berkowitz never went to trial, pleading guilty instead and receiving multiple life sentences. Abrahamsen continued to examine Berkowitz in jail, and ultimately documented his life in Confessions of Son of Sam (1985). Abrahamsen suspected Prince Albert Victor and James Kenneth Stephen worked as a collaborating team to commit the Jack the Ripper murders.\\"Murder and Madness: The Secret Life of Jack the Ripper\\".

A former United States citizen, he was one of the first people to relinquish that citizenship in order to take up Ukrainian citizenship after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Early life Zvarych was born in Yonkers, New York to Soviet √©migr√© parents who came to the United States during World War II. In later interviews, he says that at age fifteen he swore an oath to \\"achieve Ukrainian statehood or ... die fighting for it\\". In 1976 he earned a B.A. with honors from Manhattan College in Bronx, New York. Emigration to Ukraine and political career Zvarych moved to Ukraine in 1991 with the intention of pursuing an academic career, but soon after became involved in politics. In 1992, he and Slava Stetsko founded the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, a right-wing party. He renounced his U.S. citizenship in 1995. Along with fellow politician Ivan Lozowy this made him one of the first former Americans to renounce U.S. citizenship in favour of Ukrainian citizenship. A notification confirming his loss of citizenship appeared in the Federal Register in June 1997 with his name listed as \\"Roman Mychajlo Zwarycz\\". Zwarych ran for a seat in the 1994 election for a single-mandate seat representing a district of Kyiv in the Verkhovna Rada, and received 70% of the vote but was not elected due to his failure to meet the voter turnout threshold of 50% mandated by the electoral law at the time. He was eventually elected in the 1998 election from a party-list proportional district. Thereafter he sat in the Verkhovna Rada for six years, serving on various committees including the Committee on Legal Reform and the Committee on European Integration. Outside of the Verkhovna Rada he also moonlighted as a lawyer; Ukrainian courts had no requirement for practitioners of law to hold certifications or pass a bar examination. On one occasion Zvarych successfully defended a family against eviction. More importantly, during the Orange Revolution in the midst of the 2004 presidential election, he successfully argued a case on behalf of Viktor Yushchenko to prevent the creation of Ukrainian voting districts for Ukrainians in Russia. In February 2005, with Yushchenko having emerged victorious in the election, he appointed Zvarych to head the Ministry of Justice. In April 2005, articles in Ukrayinska Pravda and other media outlets accused Zvarych of lying about holding a Ph.D. from Columbia University. A spokesperson for the university had confirmed to a Ukrayinska Pravda reporter that no person by his name had earned a degree there. Zvarych called a press conference the following month in which he admitted the truth of the accusations about the Ph.D.; in his clarifying remarks, he claimed to have been an \\"all but dissertation\\" student and to have worked as an adjunct lecturer at Columbia University, being informally referred to by colleagues and students as \\"professor\\" without having held that academic rank. He accused the Ukrainian diaspora and the Komsomol of Ukraine of orchestrating a political smear campaign to blow the misunderstanding out of proportion. In the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election Zvarych was a candidate of Petro Poroshenko Bloc; placed 82nd on the electoral list.Party list of Petro Poroshenko Bloc, Ukrayinska Pravda (September 19, 2014) But the party only won 63 seats on the electoral list; hence he was not (re-)elected into parliament.Poroshenko Bloc to have greatest number of seats in parliament, Ukrinform (8 November 2014) People's Front 0.33% ahead of Poroshenko Bloc with all ballots counted in Ukraine elections - CEC, Interfax-Ukraine (8 November 2014) Poroshenko Bloc to get 132 seats in parliament - CEC, Interfax-Ukraine (8 November 2014) But he returned to parliament nevertheless on 15 March 2018 to take the place of Valery Pakzkan who was just elected head of the Accounting Chamber of Ukraine.https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2018/03/15/7174743/ References Government of Yulia Tymoshenko 1953 births People from Yonkers, New York American emigrants to Ukraine People who lost United States citizenship Manhattan College alumni Living people Third convocation members of the Verkhovna Rada Fourth convocation members of the Verkhovna Rada Fifth convocation members of the Verkhovna Rada Sixth convocation members of the Verkhovna Rada Eighth convocation members of the Verkhovna Rada Justice ministers of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko Bloc politicians Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists politicians People's Movement of Ukraine politicians Reforms and Order Party politicians Our Ukraine (political party) politicians Front for Change (Ukraine) politicians 21st-century Ukrainian politicians ","title":"Roman Zvarych"},{"id":"34291120","text":"Zich (, also Romanized as Zej; also known as Zej-e PƒÅ‚Äôƒ´n) is a village in Kakavand-e Gharbi Rural District, Kakavand District, Delfan County, Lorestan Province, Iran.

He was created a Knight of the Bath after his nephew's coronation. Family Sir Henry Seymour was born around 1503, probably at Wulfhall, Wiltshire. He was the third son of Sir John Seymour (c.1474 ‚Äì 21 December 1536.) and Margery Wentworth (c. 1478 ‚Äì 18 October 1550). His family rose to prominence following his sister Jane's marriage to the King in 1536. As well as Queen Jane, Henry Seymour's siblings included Elizabeth Seymour, Lady Cromwell, the daughter-in-law of Henry VIII's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell; Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, who was Lord Protector of England during the minority of their nephew; and Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley, the fourth husband of Catherine Parr, and stepfather to the future Elizabeth I. Career Seymour may have begun his career in the service of Richard Foxe, Bishop of Winchester. By 1526 he had followed his father and siblings into royal service, although he does not seem to have shared the ambitions or abilities of his brothers, Edward and Thomas, and did not progress at court. He served under four Tudor monarchs, although for the most part, he lived in relative obscurity and did not seek honours and preferments. He held a number of offices, including: * Keeper, Taunton Castle, Somerset by 1526‚Äì1578 * Keeper, Bridgwater Castle, Somerset 1544 * Keeper, Marwell park, Hampshire by 1547‚Äì51 * Sewer extraordinary, the chamber by 1533 * Bailiff, manor of Hampstead Marshall, Berkshire 1536‚Äì1578 * Bailiff, Romsey, Hampshire by 1546‚Äì1578 * Steward, manors of Bierton with Broughton, Whaddon and Wendover, Buckinghamshire 1536, Wyrardisbury, Buckinghamshire and Kings Langley, Hertfordshire 1536‚Äì39 * General‚Äìreceiver, manors of Bierton with Broughton, Claydon, Swanbourne, Wendover and Whaddon, Buckinghamshire, Berkhampstead, Hertfordshire and Finmere, Oxfordshire 1536-10 * Captain Lyon of Hamburgh 1544 * Carver, household of Anne of Cleves 1540 * Carver, household of Catherine Parr by 1544 * Commissioner, relief, Hampshire 1550 * Commissioner, goods of churches and fraternities 1553 * Justice of the Peace 1554‚Äì1578 * Sheriff, Hampshire 1568‚Äì9 He was, presumably, the Henry Semer who was Catherine of Aragon's carver. In 1536 he appears to have replaced Mark Smeaton in the privy chamber and following his sister's marriage, he was appointed to several offices chiefly related to the administration of her estates, some of which he lost at her death. Jane left him \\"several valuable chains\\" in her will in 1537. He was carver in the households of Anne of Cleves (1540) and Catherine Parr (1545). The queen's jewels were placed in his custody in November 1541 following Catherine Howard's arrest. In 1544 he was made captain of the ship Lyon of Hamburgh under the command of his brother Thomas, Lord High Admiral, but was held to be culpable whe in Novembern it foundered in the Dart estuary during a storm. He was offered no further military or naval command following this incident, and some time in 1545, lost his position in the household of Catherine Parr. He was made a Knight of the Bath in February 1547, soon after his nephew's accession to the throne. In the autumn of 1547, he was elected MP for Hampshire. He is not mentioned in the diaries of Edward VI, although he received a number of royal grants of land during the reign of his nephew. While both his brothers were executed after conspiring against their rivals in their struggles for power, Henry Seymour appears unscathed. In 1549, his brother, Edward, Lord Protector of England, wrote to him and asked him to bring troops to support him. It seems Henry Seymour did not respond, and did well under the administration of his brother's replacement, John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland. He was the sole executor of his mother's Will following her death on 18 October 1550, by which she bequeathed \\"various legacies of plate, jewels etc. to her relations.\\" In 1551, he was granted the manors of Marvell and Twyford, which had constituted a portion of the estates of the bishopric of Winchester, and the following year, grants for life of the manors of Somerford and Hurn, in the parish of Christchurch, with other lands to the value of ¬£202 6s. 9d. During the reign of Elizabeth I, he was High Sheriff of Hampshire for 1568‚Äì69. Marriage and issue Henry Seymour married Barbara (born c. 1515), the daughter of Morgan Wolfe, and by her had three sons and seven daughters: * Sir John Seymour married Susan, youngest daughter of Lord Chidiock Powlett, third son of William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester, by his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Capel, Lord Mayor of London. They had three sons: :* Edward Seymour :* Henry Seymour :* Thomas Seymour :* Jane Seymour (died February 1634) married Sir John Rodney (c. 1551‚Äìdied 6 August 1612) of Stoke Rodney, Somersetshire.

As with domestic violence against women, violence against men may constitute a crime, but laws vary between jurisdictions. Men who report domestic violence can face social stigma regarding their perceived lack of machismo and other denigrations of their masculinity. Additionally, intimate partner violence (IPV) against men is generally less recognized by society than IPV against women, which can act as a further block to men reporting their situation. The relative prevalence of IPV against men to that of women is highly disputed between different studies, with some countries having no data at all. Some researchers believe the actual number of male victims may be greater than law enforcement statistics suggest due to the number of men who do not report their abuse. However, for both men and women, domestic violence is among the most underreported crimes worldwide. IPV against men is a controversial area of research, with terms such as gender symmetry, battered husband syndrome and bidirectional IPV provoking a great deal of debate. The lines of the debate tend to fall between two basic polemics. The first of these argues that scholars who focus on female- perpetrated IPV are part of an anti-feminist backlash, and are attempting to undermine the problem of male-perpetrated abuse by championing the cause of the man, over the much more serious cause of the abused woman. The second polemic argues that IPV against men is a significant problem and underreported, that domestic violence researchers and feminist academics have ignored this in order to protect the fundamental gains of the battered women's movement, specifically the view that intimate partner abuse is an extension of patriarchal dominance, and that concealing violence perpetrated by women puts the abuser herself at risk of future escalation of IPV. One of the tools used to generate statistics concerning IPV perpetration, the conflict tactics scale, is especially contentious. Prevalence Estimation difficulties Determining the rate of intimate partner violence (IPV) against males can be difficult, as men may be reluctant to report their abuse or seek help. Male victims of IPV may face socio-cultural issues such as judgement by male peers, fear of coming out as LGBTQ, or having their masculinity questioned. IPV against men is generally less recognized by society than IPV against women. For some men, admitting they are the victim of female perpetrated IPV could feel like admitting that they do not follow the established social role for men, and may be an admission they are unwilling, or unable, to make. On the other hand, many abusive men readily adopt a victim identity. For example, O. J. Simpson often referred to himself as a \\"battered husband\\". In cases like this, reporting IPV victimization may lead to exposing themselves as batterers. Some male victims fear people assuming that the woman is the real victim, and must have been acting in self-defense or retaliating for abuse. Researchers have demonstrated a degree of socio-cultural acceptance of aggression by women against men as opposed to a general condemnation of aggression by men against women. Male-on-female IPV has been shown to cause significantly more fear and more severe injuries than female-on-male violence. This can lead to men not considering themselves victims, and/or not realizing the IPV they are experiencing is a crime. Some research has shown that women who assault their male partners are more likely to avoid arrest than men who assault their female partners, due to the fact that female perpetrators of IPV tend to be viewed by law enforcement agencies and the courts as victims. As such, some men fear that if they do report to the police, they will be assumed to be the abuser, and placed under arrest. However, analyses of research indicates that frequently the legal system fails to view women who use IPV against controlling male partners as victims due to gendered high expectations on women to be the \\"perfect victim\\" and the culturally pervasive stereotype of the passive, \\"cowering\\" battered woman. Statistics indicate that under- reporting is an inherent problem with IPV irrespective of gender. For example, in England and Wales, the 1995 \\"Home Office Research Study 191\\", carried out as a supplementary study to the British Crime Survey, reported 6.6 million incidents of IPV in the previous twelve months, compared with the 987,000 incidents found by the Crime Survey. The difference in the two reports was that Study 191 was a questionnaire of a random representative sample of people, while the Crime Survey attained its figures from crime records, i.e. actual reported cases of IPV. Supplementary studies carried out in 2001 and from 2004 onwards have consistently recorded significantly higher rates of IPV (committed against both men and women) than the standard crime surveys. The 2010‚Äì2011 report found that whilst 27% of women who experienced IPV reported it to the police, only 10% of men did so, and whilst 44% of women reported to some professional organization, only 19% of men did so. In a 2005 report carried out by the National Crime Council in the Republic of Ireland, it was estimated that 5% of men who had experienced IPV had reported it to the authorities, compared to 29% of women. Estimates of male victimization In England and Wales, the 1995 \\"Home Office Research Study 191\\" surveyed 10,844 people (5,886 women and 4,958 men) between the ages of 16 and 59, finding that for the twelve-month period preceding the survey, 4.2% of men had experienced IPV. Over a lifetime, this figure increased to 14.9% of men. Of the 6.6 million incidents of IPV in 1995, 3.25 million involved male victims, with 1 million incidents resulting in injury. Since 2004, more detailed annual records have been maintained as a supplementary survey attached to the annual Home Office Crime in England and Wales reports. These reports have consistently recorded significantly higher rates of both male and female victims of IPV than the standard crime surveys. In the case of male victims, the figures range from a high of 4.5% in 2007/2008 to a low of 3.1% in 2009/2010. In the Republic of Ireland, a 2005 report carried out by the National Crime Council found that 15% of women and 6% of men had suffered severe IPV in their lifetime, equating to roughly 213,000 women and 88,000 men. In Northern Ireland, police records for 2012 listed 2,525 male victims of domestic violence, an increase of 259 cases from 2011. In the United States, the National Violence Against Women Survey carried out by the Department of Justice in 2000, surveyed 16,000 people (8,000 men and 8,000 women), and found that 7.4% of men reported physical assault by a current or former spouse, cohabiting partner, boyfriend/girlfriend, or date in their lifetime. Additionally, 0.9% of men reported experiencing domestic violence in the past year, equating to 834,732 men. In 2000, the Canadian General Social Survey found 7% of men had experienced IPV from 1994 to 1999, amounting to 549,000 men. Another Canadian General Social Survey, in 2005, found 6% of men had experienced IPV between 2000 and 2005, amounting to 546,000 men. Data concerning campus rape, such as from a National Institute of Mental Health and Ms. Magazine study, has found a 1 in 7 sexual assault rate for men in U.S. colleges. In 2013, the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that from a sample of 16,000 U.S. adults, 26% of homosexual men, 37.3% of bisexual men, and 29% of heterosexual men had been a victim of IPV, compared to 43.8% of lesbians, 61.1% of bisexual women and 35% of heterosexual women. CDC Director Tom Frieden stated, \\"This report suggests that lesbians, gay men and bisexuals in this country suffer a heavy toll of sexual violence and stalking committed by an intimate partner.\\" In New Zealand, the twenty-one year Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, published in 1999, reported that of their sample of 1,037 people, 27% of women and 34% of men reported being physically abused by a partner, with 37% of women and 22% of men reporting they had perpetrated IPV. Also in New Zealand, a 2009 report by the Journal of Applied Social Psychology evaluated samples of university students (35 female, 27 male), general population (34 female, 27 male), and incarcerated participants (15 female, 24 male), and found that 16.7% of the male respondents reported physical abuse (12.9% for students and 15.4% for convicts), while 29.5% reported bidirectional (i.e. both partners commit IPV) violence (14.5% for students and 51.3% for convicts). The 2006 International Dating Violence Study, which investigated IPV amongst 13,601 students across thirty-two-nations found that \\"about one-quarter of both male and female students had physically attacked a partner during that year\\". It reported that 24.4% of males had experienced minor IPV and 7.6% had experienced \\"severe assault\\". In 2012, two Swedish studies were released that showed men experienced IPV at rates similar to women‚Äî8% per year in one study and 11% per year in the other. Gender symmetry \\"Femme battant son mari\\"; Albrecht D√ºrer The theory that women perpetrate IPV at roughly similar rates as men has been termed \\"gender symmetry\\". The earliest empirical evidence of gender symmetry was presented in the 1975 U.S. National Family Violence Survey carried out by Murray A. Straus and Richard J. Gelles on a nationally representative sample of 2,146 \\"intact families\\". The survey found 11.6% of women and 12% of men had experienced some kind of IPV in the last twelve months, also 4.6% of men and 3.8% of women had experienced \\"severe\\" IPV. These unexpected results led Suzanne K. Steinmetz to coin the controversial term \\"battered husband syndrome\\" in 1977. :See also: Ever since the publication of Straus and Gelles' findings, other researchers in domestic violence have disputed whether gender symmetry really exists, and how to differentiate between victim and batterer.List of articles:   * Since 1975, numerous other empirical studies have found evidence of gender symmetry in IPV. For example, in the United States, the National Comorbidity Study of 1990-1992 found 18.4% of men and 17.4% of women had experienced minor IPV, and 5.5% of men and 6.5% of women had experienced severe IPV. In England and Wales, the 1995 \\"Home Office Research Study 191\\" found that in the twelve months prior to the survey, 4.2% of both men and woman between the ages of 16 and 59 had been assaulted by an intimate. The Canadian General Social Survey of 2000 found that from 1994 to 1999, 4% of men and 4% of women had experienced IPV in a relationship in which they were still involved, 22% of men and 28% of women had experienced IPV in a relationship which had now ended, and 7% of men and 8% of women had experienced IPV across all relationships, past and present. The 2005 Canadian General Social Survey, looking at the years 1999‚Äì2004 found similar data; 4% of men and 3% of women had experienced IPV in a relationship in which they were still involved, 16% of men and 21% of women had experienced IPV in a relationship which had now ended, and 6% of men and 7% of women had experienced IPV across all relationships, past and present. An especially controversial aspect of the gender symmetry debate is the notion of bidirectional or reciprocal IPV (i.e. when both parties commit violent acts against one another). Findings regarding bidirectional violence are particularly controversial because, if accepted, they can serve to undermine one of the most commonly cited reasons for female perpetrated IPV; self-defense against a controlling male partner. Despite this, many studies have found evidence of high levels of bidirectionality in cases where women have reported IPV. For example, social activist Erin Pizzey, who established the first women's shelter in the U.K. in 1971, found that 62 of the first 100 women admitted to the centre were \\"violence-prone,\\" and just as violent as the men they were leaving. The 1975 National Family Violence Survey found that 27.7% of IPV cases were perpetrated by men alone, 22.7% by women alone and 49.5% were bidirectional. In order to counteract claims that the reporting data was skewed, female-only surveys were conducted, asking females to self-report, resulting in almost identical data. The 1985 National Family Violence Survey found 25.9% of IPV cases perpetrated by men alone, 25.5% by women alone, and 48.6% were bidirectional. A study conducted in 2007 by Daniel J. Whitaker, Tadesse Haileyesus, Monica Swahn, and Linda S. Saltzman, of 11,370 heterosexual U.S. adults aged 18 to 28 found that 24% of all relationships had some violence. Of those relationships, 49.7% of them had reciprocal violence. In relationships without reciprocal violence, women committed 70% of all violence. However, men were more likely to inflict injury than women. In 1997, Philip W. Cook conducted a study of 55,000 members of the United States Armed Forces, finding bidirectionality in 60-64% of IPV cases, as reported by both men and women. The 2001 National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health found that 49.7% of IPV cases were reciprocal and 50.3% were non-reciprocal. When data provided by men only was analyzed, 46.9% of cases were reported as reciprocal and 53.1% as non-reciprocal. When data provided by women only was analyzed, 51.3% of cases were reported as reciprocal and 49.7% as non-reciprocal. The overall data showed 70.7% of non-reciprocal IPV cases were perpetrated by women only (74.9% when reported by men; 67.7% when reported by women) and 29.3% were perpetrated by men only (25.1% when reported by men; 32.3% when reported by women). The 2006 thirty-two nation International Dating Violence Study \\"revealed an overwhelming body of evidence that bidirectional violence is the predominant pattern of perpetration; and this ... indicates that the etiology of IPV is mostly parallel for men and women\\". The survey found for \\"any physical violence\\", a rate of 31.2%, of which 68.6% was bidirectional, 9.9% was perpetrated by men only, and 21.4% by women only. For severe assault, a rate of 10.8% was found, of which 54.8% was bidirectional, 15.7% perpetrated by men only, and 29.4% by women only. In 2000, John Archer conducted a meta-analysis of eighty-two IPV studies. He found that \\"women were slightly more likely than men to use one or more acts of physical aggression and to use such acts more frequently. Men were more likely to inflict an injury, and overall, 62% of those injured by a partner were women.\\" Pdf. By contrast, the U.S. Department of Justice finds that women make up 84% of spouse abuse victims and 86% of victims of abuse by a boyfriend or girlfriend. As both Fiebert and Archer point out, although the numerical tally of physical acts in these studies has found similar rates of IPV amongst men and women, and high rates of bidirectionality, there is general agreement amongst researchers that male violence is a more serious phenomenon, primarily, but not exclusively, because male violence tends to inflict more psychological and physical damage than female violence. Pdf. Male violence produces injury at roughly six times the rate of female violence. Women are also more likely to be killed by their male partners than the reverse (according to the US Department of Justice, 84% of spousal murder victims are female), and women in general are more likely to be killed by their spouses than all other types of assailants combined. In relation to this, Murray A. Straus has written \\"although women may assault their partners at approximately the same rate as men, because of the greater physical, financial, and emotional injury suffered by women, they are the predominant victims. Consequently, the first priority in services for victims and in prevention and control must continue to be directed toward assaults by husbands.\\" * See also: From 2010 to 2012, scholars of domestic violence from the U.S., Canada and the U.K. assembled The Partner Abuse State of Knowledge, a research database covering 1700 peer-reviewed studies, the largest of its kind. Among its findings:Partner Abuse State of Knowledge Project Findings At- a-Glance, Sponsored by the Journal Partner Abuse, John Hamel, LCSW, Editor-in- Chief, www.springerpub.com/pa, November 2012 * More women (23%) than men (19.3%) have been assaulted at least once in their lifetime. * Rates of female-perpetrated violence are higher than male-perpetrated (28.3% vs. 21.6%). * Male and female IPV are perpetrated from similar motives. * Studies comparing men and women in the power/control motive have mixed results overall. A 2013 review examined studies from five continents and the correlation between a country's level of gender inequality and rates of domestic violence. The authors found that when partner abuse is defined broadly to include emotional abuse, any kind of hitting, and who hits first, partner abuse is relatively even. They also stated if one examines who is physically harmed and how seriously, expresses more fear, and experiences subsequent psychological problems, domestic violence is significantly gendered toward women as victims. Conflict tactics scale In a 2002 review of the research presenting evidence of gender symmetry, Michael Kimmel noted that more than 90% of \\"systematic, persistent, and injurious\\" violence is perpetrated by men. He was especially critical of the fact that the majority of the empirical studies reviewed by Fiebert and Archer used the conflict tactics scale (CTS) as the sole measure of domestic violence, and that many of the studies used samples composed entirely of single people under the age of thirty, as opposed to older married couples. Pdf. Although the CTS is the most widely used domestic violence measurement instrument in the world, Pdf. it is also one of the most criticized instruments, due to its exclusion of context variables, inability to measure systemic abuse and motivational factors in understanding acts of violence. For example, the National Institute of Justice cautions that the CTS may not be appropriate for IPV research at all \\"because it does not measure control, coercion, or the motives for conflict tactics\\". Kimmel argues that the CTS is particularly vulnerable to reporting bias because it depends on asking people to accurately remember and honestly report incidents which have occurred up to a year previously. Even Straus admitted that the data indicates men tend to underestimate their use of violence, and women tend to overestimate their use of violence. \\"He attempts to control for this by examining only reports from women. Yet this does not correct the bias, because women also tend to underestimate men‚Äôs use of violence. Furthermore, men and women alike tend to overestimate women‚Äôs use of violence. Violence by men is expected, so it is not reported; violence by women is not expected, so it is notable and reported.\\" Thus men will overestimate their victimization and underestimate their perpetration, while women will underestimate their victimization and overestimate their perpetration. Barbara J. Morse and Malcolm J. George have presented data suggesting that male underestimation of their partner's violence is more common in CTS based studies than overestimation. Linda Kelly has noted that even when dividing the data provided by CTS based studies into that given by men and that given by women (such as in the 2001 National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health), the rate of female perpetrated IPV remains at roughly the same level. Pdf. The Dunedin Longitudinal Study interviewed both partners in an attempt to test for intentional bias by the participants but found a high degree of correlation between the two partners. Indeed, > Contrary to expectations, agreement between partners did not vary with the > perpetrator‚Äôs gender or with the type of abusive behavior. R. Emerson Dobash and Russell P. Dobash have also criticized the CTS, arguing that it is improper to equate male IPV with female IPV. They question the methodology behind the CTS, the data which stems from it and the theoretical framework used by investigators who champion it, arguing that male aggression is much more severe than female aggression and the two should not be measured by the same tool on the same scale. *See also: Such an approach would make it impossible to compare male and female aggression because there would be no common measurement. Another critic, Kersti Yll√∂, who holds Straus and those who use the CTS accountable for damaging the gains of the battered women's movement, by releasing their findings into the \\"marketplace of ideas\\". She argues that, as sociologists committed to ending domestic violence, they should have foreseen the controversy such statistics would cause and the damage it could potentially do to battered women. Similarly, Nancy Worcester refers to studies which find evidence of gender symmetry and high levels of bidirectionality as part of the \\"anti-feminist backlash\\", arguing that studies which use the CTS demonstrate the \\"limitations and dangers of a gender-neutral approach to anti-violence work\\". Straus argues that it is more harmful to women to attempt to tackle the problem of domestic abuse without proper strategy based on facts: \\"The research shows that this so-called harmless violence by women because a meta-analysis by Stith and colleagues (2004) found that a woman's perpetration of violence was the strongest predictor of her being a victim of partner violence.\\" Straus responded to criticism of the CTS by arguing that it is driven by radical-feminists who are uncomfortable with any evidence that women can be as violent as men because it undermines their belief that IPV is an extension of men's desire to subjugate women; \\"one of the explanations for denying the evidence on gender symmetry is to defend feminism in general. This is because a key step in the effort to achieve an equalitarian society is to bring about recognition of the harm that a patriarchal system causes. The removal of patriarchy as the main cause of IPV weakens a dramatic example of the harmful effects of patriarchy.\\" Pdf. Straus also points out that despite being critical of the CTS, numerous feminist researchers use it for their own research, and that it was CTS based studies which first illustrated and brought to the public's attention the extent of the battered women problem in the 1970s. Battered husband syndrome The most controversial aspect of female perpetrated IPV is the theory of \\"battered husband syndrome\\". In reaction to the findings of the U.S. National Family Violence Survey in 1975, Suzanne K. Steinmetz wrote an article in 1977 in which she coined the term as a correlative to \\"battered wife syndrome\\". Steinmetz conducted several empirical investigations prior to writing her article. Using a broad-based non-representative sample of fifty-four couples, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 47% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 43%. She further found that while 39% of husbands had thrown objects, 31% of wives had done likewise; 31% of husbands had pushed or shoved their partner, compared to 32% of wives; 20% of husbands had hit their wives, 20% of wives had hit their husbands; 10% of husbands had hit their wives with an object, 10% of wives had hit their husbands with an object. In another study, using a sample of fifty-two Canadian college students, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 23% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 21%. Further investigation found that 21% of both husbands and wives had thrown objects; 17% of husbands had pushed or shoved, compared to 13% of wives; 13% of husbands had hit their wives, 13% of wives had hit their husbands; 10% of husbands had hit their wives with an object, 12% of wives had hit their husbands with an object. In a third study, using a random sample of ninety-four people, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 32% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 28%. Further investigation found that 31% of husbands had thrown objects compared to 25% of wives; 22% of husbands had pushed or shoved, compared to 18% of wives; 17% of husbands had hit their wives, 12% of wives had hit their husbands; 12% of husbands had hit their wives with an object, 14% of wives had hit their husbands with an object. These findings led Steinmetz to conclude that IPV was roughly reciprocal between husbands and wives, with a similar level of intentionality between men and women; \\"women are as likely to select physical conflict to resolve marital conflict as are men ... women have the potential to commit acts of violence and under certain circumstances, they do carry out these acts\\". According to Malcolm J. George, Steinmetz' article \\"represented a point of departure and antithetical challenge to the otherwise pervasive view of the seemingly universality of female vulnerability in the face of male hegemony exposed by the cases of battered wives\\". Steinmetz' colleague, Richard J. Gelles, publicly addressed confusion caused by the research and father's rights groups \\"significant distortion\\" of the data in his public response Domestic Violence: Not An Even Playing Field, \\"Indeed, men are hit by their wives, they are injured, and some are killed. But, are all men hit by women battered? No. Men who beat their wives, who use emotional abuse and blackmail to control their wives, and are then hit or even harmed, cannot be considered battered men. A battered man is one who is physically injured by a wife or partner and has not physically struck or psychologically provoked her.\\" Steinmetz' claims in her article, and her use of the phrase \\"battered husband syndrome\\" in particular, aroused a great deal of controversy, with many scholars criticizing research flaws in her work. In particular, she was criticized for not differentiating between verbal and physical aggression or between intentionality and action (wanting to hit was considered the same as actually hitting). For example, David Finkelhor argues that Steinmetz' methodology was unacceptably unscientific. He argues that her work looks at all violence as fundamentally similar; there is no differentiation between male and female violence, or violence against a child and violence against a wife, such as a mother spanking a child and a father breaking a mother's ribs. Finkelhor sees this as especially important insofar as it does not allow a differentiation between ongoing systemic abuse and once-off violence, or between disciplining a child and beating a partner. Causes of female-perpetrated IPV Linda Kelly writes that \\"in conceding that women do engage in acts of domestic violence, female use of violence is justified as self-defense‚Äîa lifesaving reaction of women who are being physically attacked by their male partners. The development of the battered woman syndrome as a defense for crimes committed against abusive male partners, including homicide, evidences the wide acceptance of a woman's use of violence as self-defense.\\" The theory is that when women commit IPV, it is probably justified because they were previously victims and, therefore, the male was the \\"primary aggressor.\\" Thus, the woman's violent behavior is caused by her background as a victim. Juan Carlos Ram√≠rez explains that given the socially accepted model of femininity as one of submission, passivity and abnegation, whatever behavior does not follow this stereotype will be perceived in an exaggerated manner as abnormal and violent. Thus, women will be perceived as disproportionately aggressive even if merely defending themselves. Multiple studies indicate that the majority of women's IPV against male partners is in the context of being victimized. A 2010 systematic review of the literature on women's perpetration of IPV found that anger, self- defense and retaliation were common motivations but that distinguishing between self-defense and retaliation was difficult. Other studies indicate that only a small proportion of women identify their IPV as self-defense. For example, in a 1996 study of 1,978 people in England, 21% of women who admitted to committing IPV gave self-defense as a reason. More prevalent reasons were \\"Get through to\\" (53%), \\"Something said\\" (52%) and \\"Make do something\\" (26%). In a five-year study of 978 college students from California, concluded in 1997, Martin S. Fiebert and Denise M. Gonzalez found an IPV rate amongst women of 20%. Within this group, perpetrators were asked to select reasons as to why they assaulted their partner, with the option to choose multiple reasons. The breakdown of reasons had \\"my partner wasn't sensitive to my needs\\" as the most prevalent (46%). Also found more frequently than self-defense were \\"I wished to gain my partner's attention\\" (44%) and \\"My partner was not listening to me\\" (43%). Looking beyond self-defense, studies have found a range of causes for female-perpetrated IPV. Writing of the feminist theory which regards reinforcement of patriarchy as a primary cause of IPV, Murray A. Straus writes \\"Patriarchy and male dominance in the family are clearly among the causes [of IPV], but there are many others. However, with rare exceptions, current offender treatment programs are based on the assumption that the primary cause is male dominance. Thus, they proceed under an erroneous assumption. Illustrative of this fallacious single-cause approach are the state-mandated offender treatment programs that forbid treating other causes, such as inadequate anger management skills.\\" In 2006, Rose A. Medeiros and Murray A. Straus conducted a study using a sample of 854 students (312 men and 542 women) from two American universities. They identified fourteen specific risk factors common amongst both males and females who had committed IPV; poor anger management, antisocial personality disorders, borderline personality disorders, pattern of dominating relationships, substance abuse, criminal history, posttraumatic stress disorders, depression, communication problems, jealousy, sexual abuse as a child, stress, and a general attitudinal approval of partner violence. Straus states that most female perpetrated IPV is not motivated by self-defense, but by a desire to control their partners. In 2014, a study involving 1,104 male and female students in their late teens and early twenties found that women are more likely than men to be controlling and aggressive towards their partners, more likely to demonstrate a desire to control their partners, and more likely to use physical aggression in ensuring that control. The main author of the study, Elizabeth Bates, wrote \\"this suggests that intimate partner violence may not be motivated by patriarchal values and needs to be studied within the context of other forms of aggression, which has potential implications for interventions.\\" Other explanations for both male and female-perpetrated IPV include psychopathology, anger, revenge, skill deficiency, head injuries, biochemical imbalances, feelings of powerlessness, lack of resources, and frustration.Articles: :* :* :* :* :* :* :* :* Researchers have also found a correlation between the availability of domestic violence services, increased access to divorce, higher earnings for women, and improved laws and enforcement regarding domestic violence with declines in female perpetrated IPV.  Criticism  Many critics have rejected the research cited by men's rights activists and dispute their claims that such violence is gender symmetrical,Miller, Susan L.; Lilley, Terry G. (2008), \\"Female perpetrators of intimate partner violence \\", in arguing that MRAs' focus on women's violence against men stems from a misogynistic political agenda to minimize the issue of men's violence against women and to undermine services to abused women. Pdf. Current literature on IPV has alternative viewpoints in relation to gender symmetry theory. A 2008 review published in journal of Violence and Victims found that although less serious situational violence or altercation was equal for both genders, more serious and violent abuse was perpetrated by men. It was also found that women's physical violence was more likely motivated by self-defense or fear while men's was more likely motivated by control. A 2011 systematic review from the journal of Trauma Violence Abuse also found that the common motives for female on male domestic violence were anger, a need for attention, or as a response to their partner's own violence. Another 2011 review published in the journal of Aggression and Violent Behavior also found that although minor domestic violence was equal, more severe violence was perpetrated by men. It was also found that men were more likely to beat up, choke or strangle their partners, while women were more likely to throw things at their partner, slap, kick, bite, punch, or hit with an object. Researchers have also found different outcomes in men and women in response to intimate partner violence. A 2012 review from the journal Psychology of Violence found that women suffered disproportionately as a result of IPV especially in terms of injuries, fear, and posttraumatic stress. Pdf. The review also found that 70% of female victims in one of their studies were \\"very frightened\\" in response to intimate partner violence from their partners, but 85% of male victims cited \\"no fear\\". The review also found that IPV mediated the satisfaction of the relationship for women but it did not do so for men. Gender asymmetry is also consistent with government findings. According to government statistics from the US Department of Justice, male perpetrators constituted 96% of federal prosecution on domestic violence. Another report by the US Department of Justice on non-fatal domestic violence from 2003‚Äì2012 found that 76 percent of domestic violence was committed against women and 24 percent were committed against men. Dr. Ruth M. Mann of the University of Windsor, an expert on sociology and criminology, stated her opposition to the gender symmetry theory of domestic violence on the grounds that women as well as children are the main victims in the \\"annual pile up\\" (Coyle, 2001) of victims being murdered by intimate partners and fathers throughout Canada (AuCoin, 2005; Ogrodnik, 2006). :Citing: :* :* :* Responses Police services in several locations have expanded their domestic violence programs and response units in an effort to deal with IPV against men. Shelters specifically for men have been set up in the UK; as of 2010, there are sixty refuge places available to men throughout England and Wales, compared to 7,500 places for women. The Police Service of Northern Ireland has also campaigned to spread awareness of the problem of male victimization and to promote reporting of incidents. The country's first shelter for male abuse victims, Men's Aid NI, opened in early 2013. Chairman Peter Morris has remarked, \\"Domestic violence against men can take many forms, including emotional, sexual and physical abuse and threats of abuse. It can happen in heterosexual and same-sex relationships and, as with domestic abuse against females, can go largely unreported.\\" See also * Outline of domestic violence * Battered person syndrome * Male genital mutilation * Violence against women * Violence against men References Further reading * External links Abuse Crimes Intimate partner violence Violence against men fr:Violence conjugale#Prise en compte des victimes masculines ","title":"Domestic violence against men"},{"id":"34291303","text":"The Lat√©co√®re 225 was an unusual single seat canard microlight amphibian, with a swept wing, and of pusher configuration. It first flew in 1984 but was not put into production. Design and development Before World War II Lat√©co√®re was a prolific aircraft manufacturer, particularly known for large flying boats. Post-war they produced many projects but no new designs were built and flown for almost 40 years. By the mid-1950s they had diversified, with a wide range of technical products, many with their own Lat√©co√®re type number. Some of these numbers duplicated those of earlier aircraft, for example the Lat√©co√®re 300 was an early 1930s flying boat but a 1960s high voltage circuit breaker. Just one of their diversifications produced an aircraft; the Lat√©co√®re 225 ultralight shares its number with a post-war four engine bomber project. The Lat√©co√®re 225, or Lat√©co√®re Lat√© 225 is an unusual aircraft in many ways, a low powered, single seat microlight amphibian of swept wing, canard, pusher, pod and boom configuration. Design was under way by 1983 and the unflown aircraft appeared at the Hanover and Cannes airshows of 1984. The first flight followed that July. The Lat√© 225's airframe is of composite construction. Its high wing is swept at 13¬∞ and has constant chord. There are long chord end plate fins on the wing tips, rounded at the front but increasing in depth and with a vertical trailing edge that projects aft of the wing. The lower trailing edge of these fins is diagonally hinged to provide roll control. The wing is mounted on a boom which mounts the pusher engine at its rear end and reaches forward beyond the nose, where it carries an unswept, rectangular canard. This has an elevator for pitch control. The flat sided pod fuselage is attached to the underside of the boom, with a glazed, single seat cabin forming the blunt nose. An inset rudder at the rear provides roll control. A single lift strut on each side braces the wing to the mid-lower fuselage. The underside of the pod is formed into a single step hull, equipped with a water rudder. The Lat√© 225 has an unusual tricycle undercarriage; the nosewheel retracts conventionally but the mainwheels, housed in fairings and fuselage mounted on cantilever legs, hinge upwards for landings on water, when they act as lateral stabilisers. The Lat√© 225 was originally powered by an 18 kW, (24 hp) flat-twin two stroke engine but this was soon replaced by a 20 kW (30 hp) KFM 107er. It was undergoing tests in early 1985 but its subsequent career was either short or mostly unrecorded. At some point the design was acquired by SERLAG, who renamed it the SERLAG 225EX. Aircraft on display The Lat√©co√®re 225 prototype F-WZLM, renamed as the SERLEG 225EX, is on display at the Mus√©e Historique de l'Hydraviation at Biscarrosse, once Lat√©co√®re's seaplane base.

She was the first woman to hold the office and the first woman to be elected mayor in any of the Big Four cities (Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville and Chattanooga) in Tennessee. Before entering politics, Rogero worked as a community development director, non-profit executive, urban and regional planner, and community volunteer. She served on the Knox County Commission from 1990 to 1998, and first ran for mayor in 2003, losing to the later Governor of Tennessee, Bill Haslam. While Knoxville municipal elections are officially nonpartisan, Rogero is known to be a Democrat. Early life Madeline Rogero was born in Jacksonville, Florida, one of three children of Gerald Rogero, a plumber, and Anita Ghioto, a former nun. She spent her childhood in Eau Gallie, Florida, and later in Kettering, Ohio, where she attended Archbishop Alter High School. Rogero attended Temple University and Ohio State University, before graduating with a degree in political science from Furman University in 1979. During the mid-1970s, Rogero and her first husband, Mark Pitt, worked as organizers for C√©sar Ch√°vez's United Farm Workers, a labor union that sought better wages for migrant farm workers. She and Pitt moved to Knoxville in 1980, where Pitt helped run the textile workers' union, Amalgamated Clothing & Textile Workers, now UNITE HERE. Rogero obtained a master's degree from the University of Tennessee's Graduate School of Planning, having been inspired to enter the urban planning field while helping fight an attempt by a developer to install temporary trailers in her neighborhood in anticipation of the 1982 World's Fair. Knox County Commission In 1990, Rogero successfully ran for the 2nd District Knox County Commission seat, defeating 24-year incumbent Jesse Cawood. She was reelected in 1994. Following her second term, she chose not to run again after a term-limits referendum was passed by voters in 1994. Though the referendum was not enforced until 2007, Rogero returned to non-profit work and community development, namely as head of Dolly Parton's Dollywood Foundation and then as executive director of Knoxville's Promise, a branch of Colin Powell's America's Promise. 2003 mayoral campaign In 2003, Rogero ran for mayor of Knoxville, Tennessee, competing with businessman Bill Haslam for the position being vacated by long-time Knoxville mayor Victor Ashe.

The vessel's keel was laid down on 30 January 1967 and the ship was given the yard number 1084. The ship was launched on 15 October 1967 and named Senneville, for a town in Quebec. The ship was completed on 3 November 1967 and registered in Montreal. Initially the Mohawk Navigation Company operated the ship, carrying grain for James Richardson & Sons, Limited. In 1969, operation of the ship passed to Scott Misener Steamships, with the Mohawk Navigation Company retaining ownership. On 3 July 1973, Senneville lost power in Montreal and struck a pier, causing damage to the ship's bow. Senneville set rye and soybean grain-carrying records on the Great Lakes in 1975 and 1977 respectively. On 3 October 1977, the ship went aground at Thunder Bay, Ontario carrying a load of grain. After removing some cargo, the ship was freed on 4 October with a crack in ballast tank.

The city's tree coverage percentage was estimated at 36% in a 2004 model. A peer-reviewed empirical study estimated its tree coverage at 50-53% in 2010. Atlanta's tree coverage does not go unnoticed‚Äîit was the main reason cited by National Geographic in naming Atlanta a \\"Place of a Lifetime\\": > For a sprawling city with the nation‚Äôs ninth-largest metro area, Atlanta is > surprisingly lush with trees‚Äîmagnolias, dogwoods, Southern pines, and > magnificent oaks. The city's lush tree canopy, which filters out pollutants and cools sidewalks and buildings, has increasingly been under assault from man and nature due to heavy rains, drought, aged forests, new pests, and urban construction. A 2001 study found that Atlanta's heavy tree cover declined from 48% in 1974 to 38% in 1996. This loss of tree canopy resulted in a 33% increase in stormwater runoff and a loss of 11 million pounds of pollutants removed annually, a value of approximately $28 million per year. Due to a historic drought in the late 2000s, Atlanta lost trees at an unprecedented rate. For example, Piedmont Park lost about a dozen large, historic trees in 2009, compared to two or three during normal years. Although many of Atlanta's trees are between 80‚Äì100 years old and thus reaching the end of their normal lifespan, the drought accelerated their demise by shrinking the trees' roots. However, the problem is being addressed by community organizations and city government. Trees Atlanta, a non-profit organization founded in 1985, has planted and distributed over 126,000 shade trees. Atlanta's city government awarded $130,000 in grants to neighborhood groups to plant trees. The city is home to the Atlanta Dogwood Festival, an annual arts and crafts festival held one weekend during early April, when the native dogwoods are in bloom. Clearcutting The low-density residential subdivision development that dominates the Atlanta area has historically not been required to replace lost tree inventory. Because of larger lot sizes and natural-looking architecture, such as California contemporary, older neighborhoods typically have many mature forest trees, except in cases where they have been destroyed by homeowners. Increasing density allowed by zoning since the 1980s has meant fewer and fewer trees left, and by the 2000s it became common for developers to completely clearcut dozens of acres of forest and bulldoze all hills flat to build generic tract housing, often with tightly packed homes nearly touching each other and up against the street. However, over the past decade some area cities and counties have revised their tree ordinances to require tree recompense to be equal to or greater than the pre-development tree density, trying to ensure a future tree canopy. Rather than leaving trees on each home lot as before, this typically involves a set-aside of green space in each development, with most other areas still clear-cut. Even when some trees are replaced, it is with a single type of trees planted the same distance from each other, rather than different trees at random placement and age as in the native forest. At a rate of 50 acres (20 hectares) per day, the deforestation brought by land development has had a significant impact on area watersheds, as they now flood far more rapidly and to a much greater extent than prior to development. Commentary The American Institute of Architecture's 1993 Guide to the Architecture of Atlanta: \\"Interestingly enough, the city's greatest natural asset, its lush vegetation and gently rolling topography, which eighty years ago enabled Druid Hills to become one of the most beautiful Olmstedian garden suburbs in North America, distinguishes Atlanta's highway architecture from suburban office complexes in other boom towns like Houston and Tampa.\\" Tom Wolfe, A Man in Full: \\"He looked away from the buildings and out over the ocean of trees. Since Atlanta was not a port city and was, in fact, far inland, the trees stretched on in every direction. They were Atlanta's greatest natural resource, those trees were. People loved to live beneath them.\\"[Tom Wolfe, A Man in Full, 1998, p. 63] References Geography of Atlanta Environment of Georgia (U.S. state) Forests of Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Atlanta tree canopy"},{"id":"34291645","text":"Seventh Avenue is a signal free road located in Islamabad.

Traditionally, the main work of the Summit has been an annual meeting, where top decision makers convene to discuss how to realize the dream of a healthier future through the effective utilization of scientific advances, combined with industrial innovation and appropriate policies. In autumn of 2012 on the heels of its eight major conference, the Summit shifted its focus from an annual meeting to more targeted work that builds on the past themes and concrete outcomes. As it has since 2005, the Summit will continue to provide a year-round forum for world leaders to grapple with problems and solutions, share best practices, and forge effective collaborations. History The first Pacific Health Summit was held in Seattle, Washington in 2005 with foundational support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Russell Family Foundation.\\"Summit hopes to spark talks on Earth‚Äôs health\\", The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 12/19/2004 It was the co-creation of 2001 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine winner Leland H. Hartwell, businessman and philanthropist George F. Russell Jr., Co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation William H. Gates Sr., and Founding Director of the National Bureau of Asian Research‚Äôs Center for Health and Aging Michael Birt.About the Summit NBR has been the Secretariat of the Summit since the inaugural 2005 conference. Birt, founding Executive Director of the Summit, stepped down from his role as NBR‚Äôs Center for Health and Aging Director in 2009, and from his role as Executive Director in 2012, handing the mantle to Claire Topal, the Summit's Managing Director, who ran the Summit and managed the team from 2009-2012. She now serves as Senior Advisor for International Health to NBR. Nualchan Sakchalathorn, the Summit‚Äôs Project Director, served on the Summit team from 2007-2012. Building on Bill Gates Sr.'s strong personal support, in 2007 Tachi Yamada, then President of Global Health at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, took on a decisive leadership role and formally established the Foundation as the Summit's third co-presenting organization. In 2008, the Wellcome Trust joined the Summit as the fourth official co-presenting organization, and Trust Director, Sir Mark Walport, joined our Executive Committee. Both Sir William Castell, Chairman of the Wellcome Trust, who has participated in the Summit since its first year, and Sir Mark provided crucial leadership as the Summit began its rotation in London for the annual meeting. Peter Neupert, then Corporate Vice President for Health Solutions Strategy for Microsoft, and Craig Mundie, Chief Research and Strategy Officer of Microsoft, consistently provided a private sector perspective to the Summit's strategic discussions. Additionally, GE Healthcare, through Bill Castell in 2005, has always provided critical advice and perspective, as well as the critical founding sponsorship for the annual meeting. Out of this initial foundation of leadership, the Summit grew into one of the world's premier global health gatherings every year. In 2012, eight years after the inaugural meeting, which was never designed to take place in perpetuity, global health is in an exciting new place. The Summit‚Äôs interactive format has proliferated, and decision-makers across all sectors and geographies are collaborating on all the critical global health issues the Summit sought to address: health technology, pandemic flu, MDR-TB, vaccines, malnutrition, maternal and newborn health, and many more. While the Summit is proud of eight years of transformational conversations, countless new friendships, and exciting partnerships, there is still much work to do ‚Äì and so much momentum on which to build. NBR is looking forward and excited to build on the Summit‚Äôs legacy in the years to come. Outcomes The Summit has been a catalyst for partnerships, and the setting of several global health announcements.Summit Impact In 2007, during a speech\\"Pandemics: Working together for an effective and equitable response\\", Speech by Margaret Chan, 6/13/2007 at the Summit, Margaret Chan, Director- General of the World Health Organization, publicized ‚Äúa new initiative to establish a world stockpile of vaccines to prepare for the threat of pandemic influenza.‚Äù\\"Vaccine to be stockpiled to stop a world flu pandemic\\", The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 6/13/2007 At the Summit in 2009, Sanofi bolstered that stockpile with 100 million donated doses of flu vaccine.\\"Sanofi Aventis Donates 100 Million Flu Vaccine Doses to WHO at Seattle Summit\\", Xconomy, 6/17/2009 Other partnerships furthered by, or formed at, the Summit have helped to lead to the establishment of the MSD Wellcome Trust Hilleman Laboratories,\\"Behind the Scenes on a New Vaccines Push in India\\", ScienceInsider, 9/17/2009 the Access to Nutrition Index, the Critical Path to TB Drug Regimens,\\"New collaboration aims to speed TB drugs to market\\", Reuters, 3/18/2010 and a cervical cancer vaccination deal between Merck & Co. and Qiagen.\\"Merck, QIAGEN to collaborate to increase access to HPV vaccination and HPV DNA testing in developing countries\\", NewsMedical, 9/24/2009 Additionally, the denial of a US visa for 2009 Summit participant Paul Thorn of the Tuberculosis Survival Project, due to his HIV positive status, became the impetus behind the repeal of a US travel restriction law on individuals carrying the HIV/AIDs virus.\\"Activist helps US HIV law change\\", BBC News, 7/06/2009 Publications, Videos, and Photos The Summit Secretariat, the Center for Health and Aging at The National Bureau of Asian Research, publishes reports, videos, and photos of Summit sessions and workshops.

The richest center of this more easterly style would appear to have been the area between the Dnieper and Don river systems - at least as far as indicated by the discoveries made up to the present. The art was not, like that of the caves, impressionistic, but geometrically stylized, and the chief figure was not the costumed shaman, at once animal and man, master of the mysteries of the temple-caves, but the perfectly naked, fertile female, standing as guardian of the hearth. And I think it most remarkable that we detect in her surroundings a constellation of motifs that remained closely associated with the goddess in the later epoch of the neolithic and on into the periods of the high civilizations: the meander (as a reference to the labyrinth), the bird (in the dove- cotes of the temples of Aphrodite), the fish (in the fish ponds of the same temples) , the sitting animals, and the phallus.

Their primary activities include organizing workshops for improvisational music, hosting a four-year Musicianship and Leadership Program that provides training in music facilitation, and publishing various resources related to improvisational music. Music for People was founded in 1986 by cellist David Darling and flautist Bonnie Insull. The core of the teaching methods center on Humanistic education. Graduates of the Musicianship and Leadership Program facilitate a wide range of music events and programs such as drum circles and flute circles.  Philosophy  The philosophy of Music for People is encapsulated in a Bill of Musical Rights that centers on the need for musical self- expression, authenticity, and acceptance of the full range of music traditions and the musical contributions of all people, regardless of their level of experience. The approach to music facilitation is generally unconventional, using a playful teaching style developed by David Darling beginning with his work leading workshops as part of the Paul Winter Consort beginning in 1980. The approach to tonal and rhythmic improvisation has been found to have positive social influences, both similar to and contrasting with clinical music therapy approaches. One of the core techniques used is ensemble playing, where participants have varying levels of musical experience, come from different genres of music, and often include instruments that typically do not play together. Darling's dedication to Arts-in-Education innovation and creativity earned him the 1995 Artist of the Year Award from Young Audiences, Inc. Music for People has prompted many offshoots, such as the Improv Collective at Fredonia University and the classical music program at DePauw University that incorporates music improvisation.  A Musical Bill of Rights  This sums up the philosophy promoted by the organization: * Human beings need to express themselves daily in a way that invites physical and emotional release. * Musical self-expression is a joyful and healthy means of communication available to absolutely everyone. * There are as many different ways to make music as there are people. * The human voice is the most natural and powerful vehicle for musical self-expression. The differences in our voices add richness and depth to music. * Sincerely expressed emotion is at the root of meaningful musical expression. * Your music is more authentically expressed when your body is involved in your musical expression. * The European tradition of music is only one sound. All other cultures and traditions deserve equal attention. * Any combination of people and instruments can make music together. * There are no \\"unmusical\\" people, only those with no musical experience. * Music improvisation is a unique and positive way to build skills for life-expression. * In improvisation as in life, we must be responsible for the vibrations we send one another.  Resources  The techniques used in music education have been published in a handbook on musical forms and structures,Oshinsky, 2008 as well as a set of three CDs of interviews with David Darling and Julie Weber. There are also supplementary information relating to the Musicianship and Leadership program relating to the development of activities in music workshops.

The company had its beginnings in 1898, in buildings constructed in 1890 for a shoe business, and was incorporated in 1901. Old Town entered the canoe market as a builder of canvas-covered wooden canoes. In the latter half of the 20th century, the company adopted more modern materials to maintain competitiveness. The company's plant was located along the Penobscot River.Bangor Daily News - Google News Archive Search Old Town is the largest and best known American canoe manufacturer.Tux Turkel \\"Course Correction\\" Maine Sunday Telegram (Portland, ME) September 7, 2003 It was the leading manufacturer in the world before competitors such as Grumman pressured it by adopting aluminum for manufacture after World War II. It adjusted by moving to using fiberglass and plastic in the 1960s. Old Town also produces kayaks. History The first canoe built by Old Town Canoe was constructed in 1898 behind the Gray hardware store in Old Town, Maine. Unlike the pioneering canoe businesses established by E.H. Garrish, B.N. Morris, and E.M. White, the Grays were not canoe builders themselves, but were entrepreneurs who hired others to design and build their canoes.Audette, Susan T., with David E. Baker, The Old Town Canoe Company: Our First Hundred Years, Tilbury House, 1998. The Old Town factory on Middle Street was purchased on October 23rd, 1901 by brothers Herbert and George Gray along with George Richardson.Penobscot County, Maine registry of deeds, Book 708, Page 325. It was run as a family business until 1974. The origins of canvas canoes can be traced to Maine and early canoe makers such as E.H. Gerrish and C.B. Thatcher of Bangor, B.N. Morris of Veazie and G.E. Carleton and E.M. White of Old Town, Maine. White's brother-in-law, E.L. Hinckley, became his working partner and provided the capital to open a large shop in Old Town, employing several men. The Carleton Canoe Company of Old Town built batteaux and bark canoes in the 1870s and \\"appears to be the only one of the batteaux and/or bark builders who switched to building canvas canoes and as such was the only one who brought any previous boat building experience to the industry.\\" In addition to White and Carleton, there were several smaller companies building canvas-covered canoes in the town of Old Town when the Old Town Company began its venture. Carleton and White were later bought by the Old Town Canoe Company.The Wood and Canvas Canoe, by Jerry Stelmok and Rollin Thurlow, pp. 24-25, Harpswell Press, Gardiner, Maine, 1987, Cover of 1921 Old Town catalog In 1905 a court dispute, Old Town Canoe v.

The duo consists of frontman Brandon Asraf (bass guitar, vocals) and John Tacon (drums, electronic samples, vocals). The two members have garnered a notable amount of regional success since their formation. They were signed to Photo Finish Records / Island Def Jam Records, and then Merovee Records / ADA, but now currently have distribution through Believe Recordings. History Early Years Asraf and Tacon began playing music together when they were in middle school, initially as a drum and bass improvisational duo. The two bonded further over their shared interest in songwriting. They made many attempts at playing music with other people but \\"it never worked. It always ended up with Brandon [Asraf] and I\\", according to John Tacon. Their first band together was called Black Rhythm. Both members took private lessons for their respective instruments at a young age, but were largely self-taught in their knowledge of theory and performance. Asbury Park and 7 Years in the Mystic Room In 2008, Asraf and Tacon renamed their project Brick + Mortar, and began focusing more heavily on the use of electronic samples in their music as well as relying less on improvisation and more on structured pop songs. With the promising rise of the Asbury Park musical scene, the duo began performing regularly up and down the New Jersey coast and building a reputation as one of the strongest live acts to come out of the state. Brick + Mortar's consistent performances quickly gained them a strong following as one of the best live bands in the Asbury Park music scene, eventually rewarding them with opening spots for larger national acts such as River City Extension and Jimmy Eat World at such well-known venues as the Starland Ballroom and the Stone Pony. In 2010, the band released their first studio LP, recorded independently, entitled 7 Years in the Mystic Room. The record garnered a great deal of positive feedback by critics and fans. The duo's high energy shows, positive local press, and successful first record had not gone unnoticed by music executives. In December 2010, Brick + Mortar were invited to perform at a Sony/Jive Records showcase the performance venue Le Poisson Rouge in New York City. After a sing-off with a heckler in the audience, the duo won an award presented to them by Senior V.P. of the label.  2011‚Äì2015: Dropped EP  Brick + Mortar continue to build their fanbase as well as showcase for additional labels.

The plans remain available from the Vintage Ultralight and Lightplane Association.Cliche, Andre: Ultralight Aircraft Shopper's Guide 8th Edition, page E-45. Cybair Limited Publishing, 2001. Design and development The Woodhopper was a development of the highly successful Weedhopper, substituting wood for aluminum tubing wherever possible and simplifying the design to reduce cost. It is therefore essentially a wooden Weedhopper. Both aircraft pre-dated the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules, but comply with them, including the category's maximum empty weight of . The Woodhopper has a standard empty weight of . It features a cable-braced high- wing, a single-seat, open cockpit, tricycle landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. The aircraft is of mixed construction and is optimized for low cost and ease of building. The pilot cage, landing gear and kingpost are made from aluminum tubing, while the main fuselage keel, wings and tail surfaces are all wooden structures. The Woodhopper's flying surfaces are covered in doped aircraft fabric. Its span wing is cable-braced from the single, tube-style kingpost and the whole airframe is liberally supported with a large number of steel cables. The control system is two-axis and consists of a sidestick that moves longitudinally to control the elevator for pitch and laterally to actuate the rudder for yaw control. Roll is induced by yaw-roll coupling as a result of the wing's dihedral. This control system does not allow crosswind landings, but it does make learning to fly the aircraft easy and also greatly simplifies the construction of the wing, as it has no control surfaces on it. The Woodhopper can be flown on wheels and floats. The Woodhopper was featured on the cover of Popular Mechanics in 1978, and as a result a large number of plans were sold and many aircraft were completed and flown. Construction time from the plans is estimated at 250‚Äì300 hours. Performance is determined by the engine fitted, and a wide variety of small two-stroke engines have been employed. The Woodhopper was later developed into the Gypsy.

The film is directed by William Keighley and was released by Warner Bros. on October 13, 1934. Farrell and Blondell were a comedy team in five Warner Bros. films in the early 1930s as two blonde bombshells. The other four films are Havana Widows (1933), Traveling Saleslady (1935), We're in the Money (1935), and Miss Pacific Fleet (1935). Rosie and Marie are two manicurists from Kansas City. When Rosie loses an expensive ring her gangster boyfriend gave her, she and Marie take an ocean voyage to Paris and masquerade as Girl Scouts. Plot Rosie Sturges (Joan Blondell) is a Kansas City manicurist, who has a gangster boyfriend name Dynamite Carson (Robert Armstrong). Rosie's friend Marie Callahan (Glenda Farrell) a fellow manicurist and roommate, urges Rosie to drop Dynamite and go after the three things a girl really needs \\"money, fur and diamonds\\". While Dynamite is away on business, Rosie goes on a date with a customer, Jimmy the Duke (Gordon Westcott), and he steals the diamond engagement ring that Dynamite gave to Rosie. Fearing Dynamite's anger, Rosie and Marie travel by train to New York and disguise themselves as Girl Scouts. In New York, Rosie and Marie meet two businessmen, Samuel Warren (Hobart Cavanaugh) and Jim Cameron (T. Roy Barnes), and follow them on a ship bound for Paris. Rosie and Marie persuade the two men into paying for their ship fares and buying them new clothes. Dynamite, who has followed the women to New York and on board the ship, is hiding in the stateroom of millionaire Junior Ashcraft (Hugh Herbert). Junior has hired detective Marcel Duryea (Osgood Perkins) to investigate his wife, who is having an affair in Paris with Dr. Sascha Pilnakoff (Ivan Lebedeff). Rosie and Marie learn that a millionaire is on board the ship, and they pose as French manicurists to enter his room. When Dynamite exposes them, they fall into hysterics. Junior gives them a check to calm them, and then repay Samuel and Jim for the fare. In Paris, Marcel reports to Junior, and Rosie agrees to pose as Dr. Sascha's lover to make Junior's wife jealous. Marcel, who is in league with Junior's wife, double-crosses him. However, instead of his wife's finding Rosie with Dr. Sascha, she finds Junior with Marie. Junior decides to get a divorce and marry Marie, and Rosie promises Dynamite to return to Kansas City with him. Cast * Joan Blondell as Rosie Sturges * Glenda Farrell as Marie Callahan * Robert Armstrong as Dynamite 'Dynie' Carson * Hugh Herbert as Junior Ashcraft * Osgood Perkins as Marcel Duryea * T. Roy Barnes as Alderman James 'Jim' Cameron * Hobart Cavanaugh as Alderman Sam Warren * Gordon Westcott as Jimmy the Dude * Vince Barnett as Quincy * Ivan Lebedeff as Dr. Sascha Pilnakoff Production The film was completed three months before its release, but Warner Bros. decided to delay the release of the film until after the birth of Joan Blondell's child, so that Blondell would not be off the screen for too long a period. Before the release, the film was titled \\"Princess of Kansas City\\". Reception Andre Senwald of The New York Times wrote: \\"If you can imagine the Misses Blondell and Farrell as bogus girl Scouts you can imagine almost anything, a factor which should prove of considerable assistance at Kansas City Princess. In the athletic farce at the Roxy these racy girls, the screen's foremost professors in the study of the female acquisitive instinct, are demonstrating the merry art of getting something for nothing. Like most of the product which wears the Warner Brothers trade-mark, this one is fast and lively even when it isn't funny. Its principal misfortune is that its stock is shopworn. The cynical gold-digger has gone out of fashion lately, and the photoplay suffers the ills of obsolescence. The humor is improved by Hugh Herbert and Robert Armstrong, while Osgood Perkins is attractively loony as a treacherous French detective. But Kansas City Princess is muscular, loud and frantic, rather than impressively hilarious, and even for farce it never makes a great deal of sense.\\" References External links  1934 films American films Films directed by William Keighley Warner Bros. films 1934 romantic comedy films American romantic comedy films American black-and-white films 1934 comedy films ","title":"Kansas City Princess"},{"id":"34291988","text":"Delaware and Hudson Canal Gravity Railroad Shops was a historic gravity railroad maintenance facility located at Carbondale, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania.

Population: Etymology The settlement's name is the Russian phonetic transliteration of the name of the Marquis de Castries, who sponsored the expedition of the French explorer La P√©rouse, who was the first European to sight the bay where the settlement is located. Geography The settlement is located on the Chikhachyova Bay, which was known as Bay of de Castries until 1952. History De-Kastri was named for the former name of the bay on which it stands. The bay was discovered by La P√©rouse on July 25, 1787 and named after the sponsor of the expedition‚Äîthe then Secretary of State of the French Navy, the Marquis de Castries. The bay is a convenient natural refuge for vessels, giving it strategic importance from a military viewpoint. The settlement was founded in 1853, although the land where it was situated would not officially be Russian territory until the signing of the Treaty of Aigun five years later. In 1854, the difficult task of defending Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky when it came under siege from the British and French forces during the Crimean War brought to attention the difficulties of supply and defense of the Kamchatka Peninsula, where a large section of the Russian Pacific Fleet was based. It was decided to move the port from Kamchatka without waiting for another attack. In the spring of 1855, the Russian navy's weapons and sailors under the leadership of Rear Admiral Vasily Zavoyko headed toward the mouth of the Amur River; however, the river mouth was still covered with ice. It was decided to wait for the break-up, hiding in the Bay of de Castries from the superior forces of French and English. Russian ships were discovered there, but managed to escape to the Amur River in the Strait of Tartary before the arrival of enemy reinforcements. The British and French did not know that Sakhalin was an island, and spent the later years of the war waiting in vain for the Russian fleet at its southern coast.Russia on the Pacific, and the Siberian railway (Zenone Volpicelli 1899) Anton Chekhov visited the settlement in 1890, and described it in his book Sakhalin Island. During the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese landed at De-Kastri on July 10, 1905. During the Russian Civil War, from January 11 to February 27, 1920, De- Kastri was occupied by the 48-man strong White Army detachment of Ivan Vits. The White Army was hoping to hold out in the village until the arrival of spring, to be rescued by sea by the Japanese. After a brief siege, De-Kastri was captured by the Red Army. Commander Vits was shot in the lighthouse at Kloster-Kamp (now Cape Orlov) in the settlement's vicinity. During the 1930s and early 1940s, De-Kastri became the location of a naval outpost to protect against the Japanese, who until the end of World War II possessed the southern half of Sakhalin as Karafuto Prefecture. During the war, the bay sheltered Russian naval ships. The military installations were abandoned after the war, as the whole of the island of Sakhalin reverted to Russian control. Under Joseph Stalin, De-Kastri became a gulag camp base, involved in coordinating part of the construction of a tunnel to Sakhalin beginning in 1950; specifically the construction of the railway connecting the planned tunnel with the rail network at Selikhino (near Komsomolsk-on-Amur). At its largest, the De-Kastri camp held 13,030 prisoners. The project was abandoned after the death of Stalin in 1953.De-Kastri gulag (Sakhalin Tunnel project) at Memorial Economy and infrastructure Today, De-Kastri is a seaport associated with the oil and natural gas industry, with the De-Kastri terminal located nearby. It is connected by road to Komsomolsk-on-Amur.

Jefferson has written ten novels in the Body Farm series under the pen name Jefferson Bass, in consultation with renowned forensic anthropologist William M. Bass, as well as two non-fiction books about Bass‚Äôs life and forensic cases. Life Born in St. Joseph, Missouri, Jefferson spent most of his youth in Guntersville, Alabama. As a high school senior, he was named a National Merit Scholar, a state winner in the National Council of Teachers of English writing contest, and a Presidential Scholar (one of two from Alabama). He won a scholarship to Birmingham-Southern College, where he majored in English, graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa. He did graduate study in English and comparative literature at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Prior to writing books, Jefferson worked as a staff science writer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory; as an educator and administrator at Planned Parenthood of East Tennessee; as a freelance magazine and newspaper journalist; and as a television documentary writer/producer. His writings have been published in The New York Times, Newsweek, USA Today and Popular Science, and have been broadcast on NPR. His documentaries include programs for the A&E; Network, The History Channel, and the Oxygen Network. He also wrote and directed for the National Geographic Channel a two-part documentary ‚Äî Biography of a Corpse and Anatomy of a Corpse‚Äî about the University of Tennessee Anthropological Research Facility, which is also widely known as the Body Farm. During filming, Jefferson met the founder of the Body Farm, Bill Bass, who asked for Jefferson's assistance to write his memoir, which was published in 2003 under the title Death‚Äôs Acre. Jefferson Bass The success of the memoir Death‚Äôs Acre inspired Jon Jefferson to create a series of collaborative crime-fiction novels with Bass using the pen name Jefferson Bass. In 2006, the pair published a debut novel, Carved in Bone, which reached # 25 on the New York Times Best Seller List. Every year thereafter, Jefferson Bass published another novel in the Body Farm series, including: Flesh and Bone, The Devil's Bones, Bones of Betrayal, The Bone Thief, The Bone Yard, The Inquisitor's Key and Cut to the Bone. Based on accurate forensic science, the Body Farm series has helped to increase popular interest in forensic criminal investigations involving the remains of the human body.

It uses a Dirichlet process for each group of data, with the Dirichlet processes for all groups sharing a base distribution which is itself drawn from a Dirichlet process. This method allows groups to share statistical strength via sharing of clusters across groups. The base distribution being drawn from a Dirichlet process is important, because draws from a Dirichlet process are atomic probability measures, and the atoms will appear in all group-level Dirichlet processes. Since each atom corresponds to a cluster, clusters are shared across all groups. It was developed by Yee Whye Teh, Michael I. Jordan, Matthew J. Beal and David Blei and published in the Journal of the American Statistical Association in 2006, as a formalization and generalization of the infinite hidden Markov model published in 2002. Model This model description is sourced from. The HDP is a model for grouped data. What this means is that the data items come in multiple distinct groups. For example, in a topic model words are organized into documents, with each document formed by a bag (group) of words (data items). Indexing groups by j=1,...J, suppose each group consist of data items x_{j1},...x_{jn}. The HDP is parameterized by a base distribution H that governs the a priori distribution over data items, and a number of concentration parameters that govern the a priori number of clusters and amount of sharing across groups. The jth group is associated with a random probability measure G_j which has distribution given by a Dirichlet process: : \\\\begin{align} G_jG_0 &\\\\sim \\\\operatorname{DP}(\\\\alpha_j,G_0) \\\\end{align} where \\\\alpha_j is the concentration parameter associated with the group, and G_0 is the base distribution shared across all groups. In turn, the common base distribution is Dirichlet process distributed: : \\\\begin{align} G_0 &\\\\sim \\\\operatorname{DP}(\\\\alpha_0,H) \\\\end{align} with concentration parameter \\\\alpha_0 and base distribution H. Finally, to relate the Dirichlet processes back with the observed data, each data item x_{ji} is associated with a latent parameter \\\\theta_{ji}: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\theta_{ji}G_j &\\\\sim G_j \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{ji}\\\\theta_{ji} &\\\\sim F(\\\\theta_{ji}) \\\\end{align} The first line states that each parameter has a prior distribution given by G_j, while the second line states that each data item has a distribution F(\\\\theta_{ji}) parameterized by its associated parameter. The resulting model above is called a HDP mixture model, with the HDP referring to the hierarchically linked set of Dirichlet processes, and the mixture model referring to the way the Dirichlet processes are related to the data items. To understand how the HDP implements a clustering model, and how clusters become shared across groups, recall that draws from a Dirichlet process are atomic probability measures with probability one. This means that the common base distribution G_0 has a form which can be written as: : \\\\begin{align} G_0 &= \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\pi_{0k}\\\\delta_{\\\\theta^*_k} \\\\end{align} where there are an infinite number of atoms, \\\\theta^*_k, k=1,2,..., assuming that the overall base distribution H has infinite support. Each atom is associated with a mass \\\\pi_{0k}. The masses have to sum to one since G_0 is a probability measure. Since G_0 is itself the base distribution for the group specific Dirichlet processes, each G_j will have atoms given by the atoms of G_0, and can itself be written in the form: : \\\\begin{align} G_j &= \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\pi_{jk}\\\\delta_{\\\\theta^*_k} \\\\end{align} Thus the set of atoms is shared across all groups, with each group having its own group-specific atom masses. Relating this representation back to the observed data, we see that each data item is described by a mixture model: : \\\\begin{align} x_{ji}G_j &\\\\sim \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\pi_{jk} F(\\\\theta^*_k) \\\\end{align} where the atoms \\\\theta^*_k play the role of the mixture component parameters, while the masses \\\\pi_{jk} play the role of the mixing proportions. In conclusion, each group of data is modeled using a mixture model, with mixture components shared across all groups but mixing proportions being group-specific. In clustering terms, we can interpret each mixture component as modeling a cluster of data items, with clusters shared across all groups, and each group, having its own mixing proportions, composed of different combinations of clusters. Applications The HDP mixture model is a natural nonparametric generalization of Latent Dirichlet allocation, where the number of topics can be unbounded and learnt from data. Here each group is a document consisting of a bag of words, each cluster is a topic, and each document is a mixture of topics. The HDP is also a core component of the infinite hidden Markov model,Beal, M.J., Ghahramani, Z. and Rasmussen, C.E. (2002). \\"The infinite hidden Markov model\\" (PDF). Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 14:577‚Äì585. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. which is a nonparametric generalization of the hidden Markov model allowing the number of states to be unbounded and learnt from data. Fox, Emily B., et al. \\"A sticky HDP-HMM with application to speaker diarization.\\" The Annals of Applied Statistics (2011): 1020-1056. Generalizations The HDP can be generalized in a number of directions. The Dirichlet processes can be replaced by Pitman-Yor processes and Gamma processes, resulting in the Hierarchical Pitman-Yor process and Hierarchical Gamma process. The hierarchy can be deeper, with multiple levels of groups arranged in a hierarchy. Such an arrangement has been exploited in the sequence memoizer, a Bayesian nonparametric model for sequences which has a multi-level hierarchy of Pitman-Yor processes.

Cramer & Co (London). Published in 1870 and the English words to \\"Men of Harlech\\".The Oxford Song Book (Volume 1) (1916) Political career Oliphant was a Member of Parliament, elected both before and then again after the change in the electoral system introduced by the Reform Act of 1832. His first election had been bitterly opposed because of his support for the electoral reform. His election manifesto was equally controversial and included opposition to people receiving places, pensions or sinecures (the abolition of patronage, protectionism and privilege); hostility to slavery; opposition to monopolies and the injustices of the Corn Laws; demands for reform of government Burghs, such that they should be elected by all citizens (and not just by the elite). Oliphant and Buckingham petitioned Parliament for the Repeal of the Corn Laws in 1834. It was to be another eleven years before Parliament voted to put the repeal on the statutes.Hansard 1834/apr/24 Oliphant introduced petitions to Parliament for establishing District Courts in Scotland and another against the System of Church Patronage in ScotlandHansard 1833/mar/27 and one for the return of all offices abolished by the recommendation of the Select Committee on Sinecure Offices, in 1810, 1811, and 1812, and of the Finance Committee in 1817.Hansard 1833/feb/07 He was also one of the MPs who presented a petition for the better observance of the Sabbath. In 1833 Oliphant also petitioned Parliament for the Abolition of Colonial Slavery.Hansard 1833/feb/14 In 1834 he petitioned Parliament for the Repeal of the Stamp Duty on Receipts.Hansard 29 April 1834 It was not until 1964, some 131 years later that this finally came into effect.Hansard 18 June 1964 Provost Wright nominated Lord James Stuart as a candidate to stand against Oliphant but on the day of the election polling was stopped as Oliphant had 458 votes to Lord James Stuart's 205 votes out of a possible 780 votes. So hostile were the sentiments of some members of Perth Burgh that Robert Smyth of Methven tried to block the use of the City Hall for a dinner organised for Oliphant in November 1833. The event finally went ahead in the December of the same year. In the General Election of 1837 Arthur Kinnaird, 10th Lord Kinnaird stood as a Liberal candidate in direct competition to Oliphant. This would have split the Liberal vote and so Oliphant withdrew. Other appointments Oliphant was also a Justice of the Peace for Perthshire and worked with the Perth Harbour Commission to improve facilities for access to Perth Harbour. He was also on the board of the Scottish Central Railway. Laurence was given the Freedom of the City of Perth in November, 1833 \\"for his independent behaviour at London\\". Personal life Laurence 8th of Condie is most remembered for his part in the claim for the Gask inheritance. It was a legal battle which was to last for twenty years. In 1847 James Blair Oliphant, 10th and last laird of Gask (in the male line) died. In 1848 Laurence Oliphant of Condie obtained a decree of service in absence as heir male to the estate. However his claim was contested as insufficient evidence was provided. In February 1862 the decree of service was reversed and Laurence died very shortly afterwards in May of the same year. The case was continued on behalf of his only son and heir (Laurence James Oliphant, 9th of Condie) who was a minor. The 8th Condie was 55 years old when his son was born (by his third marriage); up until that point, Laurence Oliphant the author (8th Condie's nephew) was the heir male to the Condie estate (after his father, Sir Anthony Oliphant). It was Laurence the author who then found a better claimant (Dutch Oliphants, a father and son) to the Gask inheritance than his cousin the 9th of Condie. In 1867 Laurence James Oliphant, 9th of Condie reached the age of 21 and withdrew from the contest. The Dutch Oliphants were unable to prove their ancestry but had no heirs. An arrangement was created whereby they had the benefit of the Gask inheritance during their lifetimes after which it was to revert to the female line.

The Type III Hunts differed from the previous Type II ships in replacing a twin 4-inch gun mount by two torpedo tubes to improve their ability to operate as destroyers. The Type III Hunts were long between perpendiculars and overall, with a beam was and draught . Displacement was standard and under full load.

Another, more specific source, says the destroyer was damaged by I./KG 54 and KG 77, which also sank the Ocean Voyager (7,174 grt), Greek steamer Vavara (1,654 grt).Smith, Kindell and Bertke 2012, p. 68. Derwent was beached to prevent her from sinking and was later temporarily repaired and towed to England. Some repairs were carried out, but the decision was taken to suspend work in January 1945 and she was reduced to the reserve, and finally scrapped in 1947.

First introduced as pyinstall in 2008 by Ian Bicking (the creator of the virtualenv package) as an alternative to easy_install, pip was chosen as the new name from one of several suggestions that the creator received on his blog post. According to Bicking himself, the name is an acronym for \\"Pip Installs Packages\\". In 2011, the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) was created to take over the maintenance of pip and virtualenv from Bicking, led by Carl Meyer, Brian Rosner, and Jannis Leidel.  Command-line interface  An output of \`pip install virtualenv\` One major advantage of pip is the ease of its command-line interface, which makes installing Python software packages as easy as issuing a command: pip install some-package-name Users can also easily remove the package: pip uninstall some-package-name Most importantly pip has a feature to manage full lists of packages and corresponding version numbers, possible through a \\"requirements\\" file. This permits the efficient re-creation of an entire group of packages in a separate environment (e.g. another computer) or virtual environment.

There are many examples of hold-outs in China, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and other countries.  Examples  Wickhams Department Store, Mile End Road, built around the Spiegelhalter jewellers shop Macy's headquarters at Macy's Herald Square in New York City, for example, does not cover the whole block because of a holdout named the Million Dollar Corner on the corner of Broadway and West 34th Street (in Herald Square). Now decorated as a Macy's shopping bag, the building received its name from the fact that it sold for a million dollars in 1911, an unprecedented sum at the time. One mile () north of Macy's Herald Square is 30 Rockefeller Center, which has slight setbacks at its corners of 49th and 50th Streets on Sixth Avenue due to two buildings at those corners. The owner of 1258 Sixth Avenue‚ÄîJohn F. Maxwell, grandson of the original owner‚Äîoutright refused to sell to John D. Rockefeller Jr. during the construction of Rockefeller Center. While Rockefeller was successful in purchasing the townhouse at 1240 Sixth Avenue, the lessees‚ÄîDaniel Hurley and Patrick Daly, owners of a speakeasy on 49th Street, who had signed a long-term lease‚Äîrefused to vacate unless they were bought out to their asking sum of $250 million (equivalent to $ billion in ). In Whitechapel, in the East End of London, the construction of the department store Wickhams, completed in 1927, on the north side of the Mile End Road was obstructed by the Spiegelhalter brothers who owned and ran a jewellers at no. 81. The store building was completed around the jewellers shop. In Houston, Texas, the construction of 700 Louisiana Street in the early 1980s encountered a dilemma surrounding a unique holdout. At the construction site bordered by Louisiana, Capitol, Rusk, and Smith Streets, a communications hub for the Western Union Company stood at the corner at Louisiana and Capitol Streets. Due to Western Union's unwillingness to relocate as the rerouting of communication equipment was financially infeasible, developer Hines Interests negotiated with the occupants of the Western Union building for a complete envelopment of the Western Union building in a vault within 700 Louisiana Street's modern facade, allowing the facility to resume operation on the site inside the skyscraper's 12-story adjacent bank-lobby structure. Following its later closure, remnants of the Western Union building were redeveloped and integrated into 700 Louisiana Street in 2018. The construction of new runway capacity at Narita International Airport in Japan starting in the 1990s was met with significant local protest; in one example, families refused to move even as the original and subsequent runway construction projects began around them. Property law Edith Macefield's Seattle home In the United States, private property is protected by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution from seizure by the government without \\"just compensation\\". Under the concept of eminent domain, local and national government agencies are entitled to take private property for purposes in the public interest, but must offer owners compensation amounting to the value of the property. The United Kingdom, New Zealand, and the Republic of Ireland have a comparable process called compulsory purchase, and there are equivalent laws in Australia and South Africa. In Kelo v. City of New London (2005), the United States Supreme Court held that the government is entitled to take land from private parties for any reason, including to give to private developers. The decision was widely unpopular, and spurred various states to enact laws prohibiting the practice, restricting eminent domain seizures to public works projects. However, the practice is common in other states. The efforts generally begin with an offer by the private group or government agency to purchase the land, and only become a question of eminent domain if the parties cannot negotiate a purchase price. When eminent domain seizures do occur there are often disputes over the value of the property, and whether it should fully compensate the landowner for the holdout value of the land. A historical example of a San Francisco nail house (see below) resulted in railroad investor Charles Crocker building a spite fence around a house owned by undertaker Nicolas Yung in the late 1870s, after Yung refused to sell his small property to Crocker, who was consolidating lots on which to build a mansion. Other contemporary examples include Edith Macefield, who refused to sell her Seattle house to a developer, and Randal Acker who challenged the power of eminent domain in Portland, Oregon. The People's Republic of China passed its first modern private property law in March 2007 amid the property development bubble. Nail house A nail house is a Chinese neologism for homes belonging to people (sometimes called \\"stubborn nails\\") who refuse to make room for real estate development. The term, a pun coined by developers, refers to nails that are stuck in wood, and cannot be pounded down with a hammer. Historical background In the People's Republic of China (PRC), during most of the Communist era, private ownership of real property was abolished. The central government officially owned all real estate, and could in theory dictate who was entitled to control any piece of property according to national interests. Private citizens, therefore, did not have a legal right to keep their property if the government decided they should leave (although in practice, entitlements arose for various reasons). With a strengthening economy and the rise of free markets beginning in the late 1990s, private developers began building shopping malls, hotels, and other private developments in densely populated urban centers, which required displacing residents who lived on the land. Developers would typically offer relatively low compensation to the residents, reflecting the pre-development value of their properties or the cost of obtaining alternative housing elsewhere. Should residents resist, or try to take advantage of their bargaining position, powerful developers could persuade local officials and courts to order residents off the land. In other cases, residents would be arrested on false charges or thugs would be hired to scare away the residents. More recently, the PRC has begun to accept private ownership of real estate, including the still-controversial notion that owners are free to earn money when their land becomes more valuable due to planned developments, or even simply not to sell. Discontent arose among the people over accusations of illegal land seizures by developers and corruption by complicit government officials. In March 2007, China passed its first modern private property law. The law prohibits government taking of land, except when it is in the public interest. The law strengthened the position of nail house owners, but did not entirely resolve whether making room for private commercial developments was a public interest that entitled the taking of land. Examples A holdout near Shenzhen North Railway Station in 2016 A number of high-profile nail houses have received widespread attention in the Chinese press. In one case in 2007, one family among 280 others at the location of a six-story shopping mall under construction at the location of a former \\"snack street\\" in Chongqing refused for two years to vacate a home their family had inhabited for three generations. Developers cut their power and water, and excavated a pit around their home. The owners broke into the construction site, reoccupied it, and flew a Chinese flag on top. Yang Wu, a local martial arts champion, used nunchakus to make a staircase to their house, and threatened to beat any authorities who attempted to evict him. His wife, a restaurateur named Wu Ping who had planned to open a restaurant in the home's ground floor, granted interviews and frequent press releases to generate publicity. The owners turned down an offer of 3.5 million yuan (US $453,000), but eventually settled with the developers in 2007. In another example, a nail house remained in Changsha, even after a shopping mall was built around it, and now sits in a courtyard of the mall. One owner in Shenzhen was paid between 10 and 20 million yuan (US $1.3 million to $2.7 million) for selling a seven-story building at the site of the future 439-meter (1,440 foot) Kingkey Finance Tower, that had cost him 1 million yuan ($130,000) to build ten years before. The resident held out for months following an eviction order, and was subject to harassment and extortion attempts even after he reached a settlement. Two other nail house owners held out against the Kingkey development. Another nail house became notable after it ended up in the middle of a new road in Wenling, Zhejiang Province. The elderly couple had refused to sell the property for the price offered by the government since 2001. Eventually a major two-lane road to a new train station was constructed around the house. Pictures of the home went viral on the Internet and were widely published by Chinese media. The property was demolished in December 2012 after the owners accepted a compensation offer worth $41,000. Media coverage Nail houses have received an unusual degree of coverage in the Chinese press. The Chongqing incident was initially called \\"coolest nail house in history\\" by a blogger, after which the incident was picked up by major media throughout China, including state-run newspapers, and became a national sensation. 85% of respondents to a poll on sina.com supported the couple rather than the developers. Later, however, the Chinese government forbade newspapers from reporting on the event. Another blogger, vegetable vendor Zhou Shuguang, traveled by train from his home in Hunan province to cover the incident, funded by donations from his readers. Writing under the pen name \\"zola\\", Zhou interviewed the participants, as well as crowds that had gathered and others who claimed to have been evicted from their homes. He was popularly referred to as China's first \\"citizen journalist\\" although his site was blocked as well. Others defied the prohibition as well, including the Chinese edition of Sports Illustrated, which worked a subtle reference of the incident into a magazine cover. In popular culture * In early 2010 the China Film Group Corporation, China's state-run film distributor, withdrew the film Avatar from screens early. Many commentators in China drew connections between nail house evictions and depictions in the film of forced relocation of indigenous populations by a large company. The Los Angeles Times reported that the decision was due to concerns that the film would trigger dissent over the country's nail house phenomenon. * The Castle (1997 Australian film) depicts a family unwilling to accept compulsory purchase of their Melbourne home, which is near an airport runway. *At the end of the film Batteries Not Included (1987), the elderly couple's home remains standing and the developer is forced to construct his skyscraper around it. *An online flash game developed by Mirage Games, The Big Battle: Nail House Versus Demolition Team, became popular in China in 2010. * The 1950 eminent domain-spoofing cartoon Homeless Hare involves Bugs Bunny's refusal to vacate his burrow for a skyscraper under construction.

The stalemate is resolved by the road-builders creating a kink in the road, leaving the burrow finally unscathed.http://www.worldcat.org/title/harry-the-hairy-nosed- wombat/oclc/15795537 *In New Concept English Book 2's lesson \\" Mad or not?\\" has a similar plot about the holdout, feature the writer refuse to leave away from the airport after so many neighbors leaving by the airport's bad noise.

Prospector models were available in both double-ended and transom-sterned models. *Trappers Canoes: A loose grouping of smaller canoes that has changed over the years. This class includes lower grade pleasure canoes and the Bantam, which is a 2nd grade version of Bobs Special. *Cruisers Canoes: Designed to go fast, these models are narrower, more rounded across the bottom and have finer lines than other models.

White Canoe Company was founded by Edwin White, who produced wood and canvas canoes from 1889 into the 1940s. White is considered one of the pioneers of wood and canvas canoe building and one of several prominent canoe builders in Maine. Background cover of 1915 E.M. White catalog The company's construction methods evolved from the manufacture of birchbark canoes. The transition occurred in the 19th century when canoe builders in the Eastern United States and Ontario, Canada, laid canvas instead of bark into a traditional building bed. Later, builders in Maine adapted English boat- building inverted-forms technology, whereby an external waterproofed canvas shell was fastened to a wooden hull formed with white cedar planks and ribs. Fishing from an EM White canoe The earliest commercial builder of wood-and- canvas canoe may have been Evan H. Gerrish of Bangor, Maine, a hunting and fishing guide from Brownville, Maine. Upriver at Gilman Falls, E.M. White started producing canoes in 1889. White gave an interview in 1901 in the Old Town Enterprise, saying: \\"I saw a man by the name of Evan Gerrish of Bangor riding in the Penobscot River in a canvas-covered canoe. I quickly saw the advantages of that kind over my birchbark, which moreover leaked. I examined the canvas canoe closely, and in a short time was able to produce one which was so good someone wanted to buy it.\\"The Wood and Canvas Canoe, by Jerry Stelmok and Rollin Thurlow, pp. 24‚Äì25, Harpswell Press, Gardiner, Maine, 1987, White started building canoes at his Gilman Falls family home by boiling wooden ribs in his mother's washtub and using a horse on a treadmill for power. In 1895, White's brother George and Alfred E. Wickett were working for him. Wickett would go on to help start the Indian Old Town Canoe Company (later the Old Town Canoe Company), and founded the Penobscot Canoe Company and St. Louis Meramec Canoe Company. White's brother-in-law, E.L. Hinckley, became a working partner and provided the capital to open a large shop in Old Town, Maine in 1896, the town where Old Town Canoe would be established in the early twentieth century.The Wood and Canvas Canoe, by Jerry Stelmok and Rollin Thurlow, pp. 24-25, Harpswell Press, Gardiner, Maine, 1987, After World War Two, Walter King, one of White‚Äôs employees, and his brother-in-law Pat Farnsworth purchased the company and changed the name to White Canoe Company and began to build fiberglass canoes.

Beginning in 1877, a time ball was dropped from the top of the building at exactly noon, triggered by a telegraph from the National Observatory in Washington, D.C. This system, invented by George May Phelps, was later used as the initial reference for Standard railway time in 1883, and would stay in use until 1912.http://www.telegraph-history.org/george-m-phelps/.

An educator as well as a pannist, a percussionist and drummer, he is credited with bringing about the teaching of steelpan playing throughout the UK.Pavlova, \\"Tribute to Selwyn Baptiste 1936 ‚Äì 2012\\", Notting Hill Post (originally \\"Pavlova Diaries\\"), 27 January 2012. Biography Selwyn Baptiste was born in La Romaine, near San Fernando in the south of Trinidad. He moved to Britain at the age of 24, in 1960, having that year won the title of \\"Best Pan Soloist\\" at the Trinidad Carnival. With the Caribbean Trio steelband in the 1960s, he played in Switzerland, US bases in Germany, and NATO bases in France and the Netherlands.Andrew Martin, Ray Funk, \\"Cyril Khamai, global pan pioneer\\", Trinidad and Tobago Guardian, 6 February 2013. A gifted musician, he started a course studying music at Dartington College of Arts but, according to cultural activist Ra Hendricks, he \\"became disenchanted with the set-up in the educational institution and found his way to Ladbroke Grove\\". Baptiste soon became involved in community educational work in the area, and began teaching children to play the steel pan at the Wornington Road adventure playground (now the Venture Centre) off Golborne Road in North Kensington, joining forces with community worker Rhaune Laslett. By 1970, \\"the Notting Hill Carnival consisted of 2 music bands, the Russell Henderson Combo and Selwyn Baptiste‚Äôs Notting Hill Adventure Playground Steelband and 500 dancing spectators.\\"Michael La Rose, , July 2004. Submitted to Joseph Charles Media, publishers of Soca News, for August 2004 Notting Hill Carnival edition of Carnival Groove. In the 1970s Baptiste was instrumental in bringing about the close association of The Tabernacle in Notting Hill with Carnival. As noted in one tribute to him: \\"Those who recall the Sundays in the Tabernacle during the run-up to the Bank Holiday weekend in the mid- to late-70s ‚Äì with Metronomes and Ebony Steelbands, DJs Shadow, Lord Sam and the young Freddie - will remember that it was a nondescript community hall. He gave it Carnival purpose.\\"\\"Selwyn Baptiste (10.07.1936-05.01.2012)!\\", Southward, CaribbeanCricket.com, 07/01/12. In 2011, the Tabernacle honoured Baptiste with a lifetime achievement award. Baptiste founded the Carnival Development Committee in 1975, chairing it until 1979.Elizabeth Pears, In the words of Alex Pascall, a former chair of the Carnival and Arts Committee: \\"Baptiste put his heart and soul into educating young people about Caribbean culture using the steel band. He was a deeply cultural person and was very concerned about the welfare of young people.\\" In a 1977 television documentary, Baptiste was quoted as saying: :\\"Carnival is not a political event. Carnival is a cultural event. It is something which supersedes political ideologies. Carnival is something that's big enough to accommodate all forms of thought, all sorts of themes. Politics is part of it, but it is not an exclusively political event.\\"Episode of The London Programme broadcast on 31 July 1977, as quoted in Sudeep Dasgupta and Esther Peeren (eds), Constellations of the Transnational: Modernity, Culture, Critique, Amsterdam-New York: Editions Rodopi B.V., 2007; p. 76.

History Davies had announced prior to its premiere that his Seventh Symphony was to be his last work in the form . Less than six months later, Davies amended his statement to say that it was only the last of a seven- symphony cycle: \\"No. 8, next year, will be a musical account of my visit to Antarctica, with very different aims and preoccupations\\" . Advance publicity for the Eighth proved to be more than that for the other seven symphonies put together . Davies sailed from the Falklands to Antarctica on RSS James Clark Ross, shown here in port at Rothera Station Three years earlier the British Antarctic Survey, which was seeking to promote the region's significance, had asked the Philharmonia Orchestra to recommend a composer for the commission of an orchestral work intended to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of Ralph Vaughan Williams's score for the 1948 film Scott of the Antarctic and the Seventh Symphony (Sinfonia antartica) which he fashioned out of that film score. Davies, as a committed environmentalist, was chosen. Terms of the commission required the composer to visit Antarctica, which he did for three weeks from late December 1997 to January 1998 (; ; ; ). The composer published his diary of the trip as an illustrated book, Notes from a Cold Climate . The composer also revealed that the symphony reflects his experience of having heard Vaughan Williams's Seventh at its first performance in Manchester in 1953 (; ). In the end, Davies decided that his new work would also be a symphony. Davies conducted the Philharmonia Orchestra in the premiere of his Antarctic Symphony at the Royal Festival Hall in London, on 6 May 2001 . At this time, Davies once more announced that this would be absolutely his last symphony (; ). This time it would take him ten years to change his mind. Character and materials View from Fossil Bluff Main Hut (BAS), which Davies visited in 1997‚Äì98 Davies said he was \\"greatly influenced by my encounter with scientists searching into ways in which the Antarctic will change our environment over the coming centuries\\" . The sounds of two particular events in his polar journey were incorporated directly into the symphony. The BAS had flown the composer to the Falklands, but from there onward it was a sea voyage. In his journal, Davies described hearing \\"the ice crack and split before the bow, then roar along, keel to stern, in a tumultuous clatter of slabs and shards\\", and this sound is represented at the beginning of the symphony through the percussive use of a biscuit tin filled with broken glass, a tam-tam with plastic soapdish, and three lengths of builders' scaffolding. The second sound was of an avalanche as the ship passed through a narrow channel between ice mountains. The composer described the sound that suddenly enveloped the ship as \\"the mightiest, gentlest, longest whisper ever. It was a sound which seemed almost quieter than the silence which surrounded it\\" . These two sounds, of an ice-break and an avalanche, suggested using a Pentecost plainsong associated with the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles, which Davies had used before: \\"Dum complerentur dies pentecostes erant omnes pariter dicentes: Alleluia. Et subito factus est sonus de coelo ‚Ä¶ Tamquam spiritus vehementis\\" (And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place saying: Alleluia. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven ‚Ä¶ as of a mighty rushing wind) . Instrumentation The symphony is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, five percussionists (xylophone with Japanese temple gong and 2 cymbals, glockenspiel, marimba, crotales, tubular bells, bell-tree, very small high wood-block, Chinese cymbals, clashed cymbals, 4 suspended cymbals (very small, small, medium, large), nipple gong, tam-tam (with plastic soap-dish), tuned brandy glasses (with water), 2 small pebbles, football rattle, biscuit tin (filled with broken glass), 3 lengths of metal builder's scaffolding (5 inches or 18 cm, 12 inches or 30 cm, 16 inches or 40 cm) to be hit by a mallet), harp, celeste, strings Analysis The symphony is in a single movement divided into five sections, reflecting the five movements of Vaughan Williams's Seventh . It is constructed symmetrically around a central scherzo, preceded and followed by slow sections, and faster music at the beginning and end . A brief introduction is followed by an allegro exposition featuring sharply contrasting dynamics. The first slow section begins with a simple clarinet melody accompanied by pizzicato cellos. Material from the introduction is then developed in a faster tempo, leading into the central scherzo which recalls Davies's An Orkney Wedding with Sunrise. This ends with an episode describing the litter left behind by early Antarctic expeditions, represented here by quotations from Davies's own recent works, followed by the second slow section, with glittering icy sounds overlaying earlier material. The final fast section transforms the ideas from the exposition, representing the changing shape of partially thawing icebergs in midsummer, and a slower coda brings back elements from the introduction (; ).

Her fascination with London and the underworld led her to write Dirty Game, followed by best sellers Black Widow, Scarlet Women, Jail Bird, The Make, Playing Dead and Nameless. Earlier years Jessie Keane was born in Hampshire, United Kingdom to Protestant parents. The Keane family were very wealthy due to the family business, however, when Jessie was fourteen, the family firm went bankrupt and she was left struggling financially in dead end jobs. She fled to London to escape a troubled family life, and fell in love with the city and the shady characters she met around the East End and Soho. After marriage and divorce, she went on to write the acclaimed novel Dirty Game, starring Annie Bailey (later to become Annie Carter). She began writing at an early age, scripting puppet shows in primary school and winning literary prizes at the age of eight. That love of writing, that compulsion to write, never left her. So finally, determined to succeed in that field, she sold her wedding dress and bought a second-hand computer with the proceeds. Flat broke, she penned chick lit novels without success. Then she wrote Dirty Game wearing a coat at the computer because she couldn't afford to have central heating installed. Her new partner told her to 'get a proper job' but she had a feeling this book was different. She sent it out to six agents, two came back straight away and one of them said she had someone who might be interested. Days later, Jessie was offered a 3-book deal for a six figure sum, and her writing career took off. Career Her first novel, Dirty Game was published in February 2008 and shot straight to the top of the Heatseekers chart, after Jessie phoned a highly popular publisher who commented that Keane's book was \\"highly gripping\\". After the success of Jessie's first book, which featured fictional character Annie Bailey, Keane went on to write a collection of books featuring Bailey. Those books included Dirty Game, Scarlett Woman, Black Widow and Playing Dead. In 2008, when her first book was first published, Keane won five National Book Awards. Keane's books have been described as \\"Utterly compelling\\" by television presenter Lorraine Kelly and also television presenter Philip Schofield commented that he \\"couldn't put the book down\\". \\"A QUEEN OF CRIME IS BORN,\\" said a major literary critic. Her novel, Nameless, was a move away from Annie Bailey, and features the headstrong character, Ruby Darke which her fans raved about. Ruby's search for her lost nameless son tugged at everyone's heartstrings. Keane released Ruthless in July 2013; it is the fifth book in the much acclaimed Annie Bailey/Carter series. Fans are always gasping to get their hands on the next Annie Carter book. Then came Lawless which followed Ruby Darke's progress again, then a stand-alone Dangerous' and now Stay Dead, the sixth of the Annie Bailey/Carter books has been released to great critical acclaim. And Annie's daughter Layla is going to carry on the family tradition of getting into terrible scrapes in her lovelife and in gangland London. Personal life Jessie Keane lives in London and Hampshire.

Looney Tunes cartoon, directed by Jack King. The short was released on August 16, 1935, and stars Buddy, the second star of the series. The short is the last cartoon to feature Buddy, the sole star of the Looney Tunes series since September 1933's Buddy's Day Out. The next film in the series, A Cartoonist's Nightmare, features Beans the Cat. The theme music is \\"Lulu's Back In Town\\". Summary In Washington, D.C., at the Department of Justice, an agent rushes a letter off to Federal Agent Buddy at 000 1/2 Cornbread Avenue in Kansas City, Missouri. In Kansas City, Our Hero opens the letter and reads his order: \\"Conduct secret investigation as to the treatment accorded prisoners by Warden at Sing-Song Prison.\\" Donning a false mustache and his cap, Buddy spits on a horseshoe and tosses it behind him, flipping his lid upon seeing that he has broken a mirror. Shrugging it off, he starts out the door. Gathering his dog, which is dressed like Sherlock Holmes, Buddy goes off to the police station. From the station, two officers are taking Machinegun Mike to Sing-Song. There is a great commotion amongst a gathered throng. Buddy and his dog latch themselves onto the back of the police car. A troupe of motorcycles precedes the car as it rolls past the gates of the prison. Buddy opens the door of the office of Warden Otto B. Kinder, on whom he spies, taking notes continually. When the prisoners break into a musical number (\\"Lulu's Back in Town,\\" again), the Warden orders them to be silent. The Warden also orders silence from two prisoners exchanging letters. He gives a mallet to a lazy prisoner supposed to be smashing rocks, instead tapping out \\"London Bridge Is Falling Down\\", only to be accidentally smacked in the head by the mallet. Another prisoner is attempting to propel himself from the prison by means of a cannon, but is given a pick-axe. Buddy rushes off to a typewriter and begins a letter to his Chief in Washington: \\"Inspection completed. Recommend change in warden. Have some new ideas how prison should be run.\\" A newspaper then reveals to us that Our Hero has been chosen warden! The prisoners now are shown to be enjoying some of their time at the prison; Warden Buddy doles out ice cream and offers cigars to his subjects. Machinegun Mike is given a notice of pardon by a guard, but sets it aflame with his cigar. He instead continuing working on a rock with his jackhammer. Prisoners rush through the gates now, pleasantly excited that Buddy is warden. But some must be shut out, because, as a sign hung over the gate by the new warden states, there are \\"no vacancies.\\" Buddy's address Buddy lives at 000 1/2 Cornbread Avenue, just as Cookie is shown to live at 00 1/2 Cornbread Avenue in Buddy the Detective. Another similarity between this cartoon and Buddy the Detective is the use of Holmesian garb, although here it is worn by the dog rather than the protagonist. That's All Folks! This is the fourth and last Buddy cartoon after which Beans the Cat delivers the traditional Looney Tunes valediction, \\"That's all, folks!\\" For more on this, see the relevant section of the article on Buddy's Bug Hunt.

In the episode, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln)'s actions initiate a standoff between his group, Dave (Michael Raymond-James) and Tony's (Aaron Munoz) men, and the walkers nearby. Meanwhile, Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal) decides to save Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies), who has been injured in a car accident. Plot Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies), having gotten into a car accident while trying to find Rick (Andrew Lincoln), fends off two walkers and makes her way towards town. Back on the Greene farm, the rest of the group discover Lori's absence. Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride) attempts to ask Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) go find Lori, but learns he was the one who let her go alone to find Rick, and no longer wishes to be anyone's \\"errand boy.\\" Daryl berates Carol for not minding her own business. Carol leaves to find Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal) and explains Lori's absence. Shane is able to find her, and lies to her that Rick has returned to the farm to get her to come back with him. When they return to the farm and Rick is not yet there, Shane admits to Lori he was more worried about her unborn child, inadvertently revealing her pregnancy to the rest of the group. Meanwhile, Andrea (Laurie Holden) consoles Hershel's daughter Maggie (Lauren Cohan) and tells her to be strong for her sister, Beth (Emily Kinney), who is still in a comatose state. In town, Rick, Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson), and Glenn (Steven Yeun) prepare to leave after shooting down Dave (Michael Raymond-James) and Tony (Aaron Munoz), when a three-man search party arrives outside the tavern looking for Dave and Tony. Rick tries to profess self-defense, but the search party refuses to accept this, leading to a standoff. Rick's group escapes out the back of the tavern, and Rick tells Hershel to cover Glenn while he makes a run for the car. A man named Sean (Keedar Whittle), who was part of the group, sneaks up behind Glenn and attempts to shoot him. Hershel shoots and wounds Sean, who starts crying out in pain. Rick asks Hershel what happened, he says he thinks Glenn was hit. Rick finds Glenn is just frozen behind a dumpster. Walkers begin to devour Sean and he is left for dead. Gunfire between the groups attracts a nearby horde of walkers. The attackers cease fire and attempt to escape, but one, Randall (Michael Zegen), ends up impaling his leg on a fence. Rick's group decides to save Randall by yanking him off the fence. They blindfold Randall and return to the farm. Hershel immediately operates to save Randall's leg, but he states he sustained nerve damage and will not be able to walk for a week. Rick's decision to return with Randall is met by skepticism from Shane who believes this to be a risky decision. Rick says that once Randall is well enough, they will release him far enough away from the farm to keep its location unknown; Hershel backs this plan up, telling Shane that Rick's group will have to leave the farm should they do otherwise. Glenn attempts to distance himself from Maggie, telling her that their relationship caused him to lose his focus during the shootout in town. Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn) continues to ask the others about Shane, and is shocked that Andrea seems to side with Shane that Rick has refused to accept the reality of the situation. Lori speaks to Rick about what Dale has told her regarding Shane, including the threats he made towards Dale and his involvement in Otis' death. She also tells Rick that Shane believes her child is Shane's, and that their affair was not a mistake. Lori warns Rick that Shane is dangerous.

He dedicated to her his Piano Sonata No. 14, later known as the Moonlight Sonata.  Life  Julie Guicciardi, as she was named by her family, was born in Przemy≈õl, Galicia.Steblin (2009, p. 96) claimed that Guicciardi was not born in 1784, as often reported, but two years earlier. But two sources, unknown to Steblin, disprove this hypothesis: Guicciardi's baptismal certificate und the date of birth on her tombstone in W√§hring. Her parents were Count Franz Joseph Guicciardi and Countess Susanna von Brunswik. She arrived in Vienna with her parents from Trieste in June 1800, and her beauty caused her to be noticed by high society. She was soon engaged to Count von Gallenberg (1780A date corrected by Steblin (2009, p. 123); often incorrectly reported as 1783, thus making Gallenberg 3 years younger.‚Äì1839), an amateur composer, whom she married on 14 November 1803.Steblin (2009, p. 145). Subsequently, they moved to Naples. She returned to Vienna in 1822. In later years, Count Hermann von P√ºckler-Muskau was among her admirers. She died in Vienna in 1856.  Connection with Beethoven  Beethoven became acquainted with Guicciardi through the Brunsvik family (often known in English as \\"Brunswick\\"). He was particularly intimate with her cousins, the sisters Therese and Josephine Brunsvik (whom he had taught the piano since 1799). In late 1801, he became Guicciardi's piano teacher, and apparently became infatuated with her. She is probably the \\"enchanting girl\\", about whom he wrote on 16 November 1801 to his friend Franz Gerhard Wegeler: \\"My life is once more a little more pleasant, I'm out and about again, among people ‚Äì you can hardly believe how desolate, how sad my life has been since these last two years; this change was caused by a sweet, enchanting girl, who loves me and whom I love. After two years, I am again enjoying some moments of bliss, and it is the first time that ‚Äì I feel that marriage could make me happy, but unfortunately she is not of my station ‚Äì and now ‚Äì I certainly could not marry now.\\"\\"etwas angenehmer lebe ich jezt wieder, indem ich mich mehr unter Menschen gemacht, du kannst es kaum glauben, wie √∂de, wie traurig ich mein Leben seit 2 Jahren zugebracht ... diese Ver√§nderung hat ein liebes zauberisches M√§dchen hervorgebracht, die mich liebt, und die ich liebe, es sind seit 2 Jahren wieder einige seelige Augenblicke, und es ist das erstemal, da√ü ich f√ºhle, da√ü ‚Äì heirathen gl√ºcklich machen k√∂nnte, leider ist sie nicht von meinem stande.\\" (Brandenburg 1996, #70.) Title page for the first edition of the Piano Sonata No. 14 (1802) In 1802, he dedicated to her (using the Italian form of her name \\"Giulietta Guicciardi\\" to conform with the conventions of dedications) the Piano Sonata No. 14, which although originally titled Sonata quasi una Fantasia (like its companion piece) subsequently became known by the popular nickname Moonlight Sonata.Ludwig van Beethoven, Sonate f√ºr Klavier (cis-Moll) op. 27, 2 (Sonata quasi una fantasia), Cappi, 879 Beethovenhaus. Retrieved 12 January 2012. This dedication was not Beethoven's original intention, and he did not have Guicciardi in mind when writing the Moonlight Sonata. Thayer, in his Life of Beethoven, states that the work Beethoven originally intended to dedicate to Guicciardi was the Rondo in G, Op. 51 No. 2, but this had to be dedicated to Countess Lichnowsky. So he cast around at the last moment for a piece to dedicate to Guicciardi.According to recent scholarship, Beethoven may have dedicated the sonata to Julie as \\"payback\\" for an unwanted gift he had received from her mother. See: Steblin (2009, pp. 90, 131). In 1823, Beethoven confessed to his then-secretary and later biographer Anton Schindler, that he was indeed in love with her at the time.Ludwig van Beethovens Konversationshefte, ed. Karl-Heinz K√∂hler and Dagmar Beck, vol. 2, Leipzig 1976, p. 366 f. In his 1840 Beethoven biography, Schindler claimed that \\"Giulietta\\" was the addressee of the letter to the \\"Immortal Beloved\\". This notion was instantly questioned (though not in public) by her cousin Therese Brunsvik: \\"Three letters by Beethoven, allegedly to Giulietta. Could they be a hoax?\\"\\"Drei Briefe von Beethoven, angeblich an Giulietta. Sollten es Machwerke sein?\\" (Therese's Diary, 12 November 1840, in Tellenbach 1983, p. 15). The letter to the \\"Immortal Beloved\\" consists of three parts. Therese's doubts were well-founded because, unlike Schindler and other contemporaries, she knew all about the intense and long-lasting romance between Beethoven and her sister Josephine: \\"Three letters by Beethoven ... they must be to Josephine whom he had loved passionately.\\"\\"3 Briefe von Beethoven ... sie werden wohl an Josephine sein, die er leidenschaftlich geliebt hat.\\" (Therese's Diary, 15 February 1847, in Goldschmidt 1977a, p. 295). The claim that \\"Giulietta\\" was the \\"Immortal Beloved\\" has been thoroughly discredited. In the 1994 film Immortal Beloved, Countess Guicciardi is played by Valeria Golino.

He is one of the three most important philosopher-theologians of Western Europe in the High Middle Ages, together with Thomas Aquinas and William of Ockham. Scotus has had considerable influence on both Catholic and secular thought. The doctrines for which he is best known are the \\"univocity of being\\", that existence is the most abstract concept we have, applicable to everything that exists; the formal distinction, a way of distinguishing between different aspects of the same thing; and the idea of haecceity, the property supposed to be in each individual thing that makes it an individual. Scotus also developed a complex argument for the existence of God, and argued for the Immaculate Conception of Mary. Duns Scotus was given the scholastic accolade Doctor Subtilis (\\"the Subtle Doctor\\") for his penetrating and subtle manner of thought. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1993.  Life  Plaque commemorating Duns Scotus in the University Church, Oxford Little is known of Duns Scotus apart from his work. His date of birth is thought to have been between 23 December 1265 and 17 March 1266, born into a leading family of the region. The reputed site of his birth, in front of the Pavilion Lodge, near the North Lodge of Duns Castle in Scotland, is now marked by a cairn which was erected in 1966 by the Franciscan friars of the United Kingdom to mark the 700th anniversary of his birth. Duns Scotus received the religious habit of the Friars Minor at Dumfries, where his uncle, Elias Duns, was guardian. Duns Scotus's age is based on the first certain date for his life, that of his ordination to the priesthood at St Andrew's, Northampton, England, on 17 March 1291. The minimum canonical age for receiving holy orders is 25 and it is generally assumed that he would have been ordained as soon as it was permitted.Williams 2002, p. 2 That his contemporaries called him Johannes Duns, after the medieval practice of calling people by their Christian name followed by their place of origin, suggests that he came from Duns, in Berwickshire, Scotland.Although Vos (2006, p. 23) has objected that 'Duns' was actually his family name, as someone from Duns would have been known as 'de Duns'. According to tradition, Duns Scotus was educated at a Franciscan studium generale (a medieval university), a house behind St Ebbe's Church, Oxford, in a triangular area enclosed by Pennyfarthing Street and running from St Aldate's to the Castle, the Baley and the old wall,Vos 2006, p. 27. See also where the Friars Minor had moved when the University of Paris was dispersed in 1229‚Äì30. At that time there would have been about 270 persons living there, of whom about 80 would have been friars.Vos 2006, p. 27 Duns Scotus appears to have been in Oxford by 1300, as he is listed among a group of friars for whom the provincial superior of the English ecclesiastical province (which included Scotland) requested faculties from the Bishop of Lincoln for the hearing of confessions. He took part in a disputation under the regent master, Philip of Bridlington in 1300‚Äì01.Williams, Thomas (ed.). The Cambridge Companion to Duns Scotus. Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 3. He began lecturing on Peter Lombard's Sentences at the prestigious University of Paris towards the end of 1302. Later in that academic year, however, he was expelled from the University of Paris for siding with Pope Boniface VIII in his feud with King Philip IV of France over the taxation of church property. Duns Scotus was back in Paris before the end of 1304, probably returning in May. He continued lecturing there until, for reasons that are still mysterious, he was dispatched to the Franciscan studium at Cologne, probably in October 1307. According to the 15th-century writer William Vorilong, his departure was sudden and unexpected. He was relaxing or talking with students in the Prato clericorum or Pre-aux- Clercs ‚Äì an open area of the Rive Gauche used by scholars for recreation ‚Äì when orders arrived from the Franciscan Minister General; Scotus left immediately, taking few or no personal belongings.Narratur de Doctori Subtili qui in Prato clericorum, visa Generalis Ministri obedentia, dum actu Regens esse in scholis Parisiensibus, aut pauca aut nulla de rebus habita dispositione, Parisis exivit ut Coloniam iret, secundum ministri sententiam. William Vorilong, Opus super IV libros Sententiarum II, d. 44, q. 1 f. 161va. Duns Scotus died unexpectedly in Cologne in November 1308; the date of his death is traditionally given as 8 November. He is buried in the Church of the Friars Minor there. His sarcophagus bears the Latin inscription: The story about Duns Scotus being buried alive, in the absence of his servant who alone knew of his susceptibility to coma, is probably a myth. It was reported by Francis Bacon in his Historia vitae et mortis. The colophon of Codex 66 of Merton College, Oxford says that Scotus was also at Cambridge.  Work  Scotus's great work is his commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, which contains nearly all the philosophical views and arguments for which he is well known, including the univocity of being, the formal distinction, less than numerical unity, individual nature or \\"thisness\\" (haecceity), his critique of illuminationism and his renowned argument for the existence of God. His commentary exists in several versions. The standard version is the Ordinatio (also known as the Opus oxoniense), a revised version of lectures he gave as a bachelor at Oxford. The initial revision was probably begun in the summer of 1300 ‚Äì see the remarks in the Prologue, question 2, alluding to the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar in 1299, news of which probably reached Oxford in the summer of 1300. It was still incomplete when Scotus left for Paris in 1302. The original lectures were also transcribed and recently published as the Lectura.See the Bibliography under The Examined Report of the Paris Lecture, Reportatio I-A. The two other versions of the work are Scotus's notes for the Oxford lectures, recently published as the Lectura, the first book of which was probably written in Oxford in the late 1290s, and the Reportatio parisiensis (or Opus parisiense), consisting of transcriptions of the lectures on the Sentences given by Scotus when he was in Paris. A reportatio is a student report or transcription of the original lecture of a master. A version that has been checked by the master himself is known as a reportatio examinata. By the time of Scotus, these 'commentaries' on the Sentences were no longer literal commentaries. Instead, Peter Lombard's original text was used as a starting point for highly original discussions on topics of theological or philosophical interest.See e.g. Wolter 1995, p. 76 and passim For example, Book II Distinction 2, about the location of angels, is a starting point for a complex discussion about continuous motion, and whether the same thing can be in two different places at the same time (bilocation). In the same book, Distinction 3, he uses the question of how angels can be different from one another, given that they have no material bodies, to investigate the difficult question of individuation in general. Colophon from the edition of Scotus' Sentences commentary edited by Thomas Penketh (died 1487) and Bartolomeo Bellati (died 1479), printed by Johannes de Colonia and Johannes Manthen, Venice in 1477. It reads Explicit Scriptum super Primum Sententiarum: editum a fratre Johanne Duns: ordinis fratrum minorum Printed versions of scholastic manuscripts became popular in the late fifteenth century. Scotus wrote purely philosophical and logical works at an early stage of his career, consisting of commentaries on Aristotle's Organon. These are the Questions on Porphyry's Isagoge and Aristotle's Categories, Peri hermeneias, and De sophisticis elenchis, probably dating to around 1295.See the introduction to the critical edition: Duns Scoti Quaestiones in librum Porphyrii Isagoge et Quaestiones super Praedicamenta Aristotelis (Opera philosophica, I), xxix‚Äìxxxiv, xli‚Äìxlii. His commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics was probably written in stages, the first version having started around 1297, with significant additions and amendments possibly after the completion of the main body of the Ordinatio., although this is speculative His Expositio on the Metaphysics was lost for centuries but was recently rediscovered and edited by Giorgio Pini.Thomas Williams (2009). \\"John Duns Scotus\\", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (online). In addition, there are 46 short disputations called Collationes, probably dating from 1300‚Äì1305; a work in natural theology (De primo principio); and his Quaestiones Quodlibetales, probably dating to Advent 1306 or Lent 1307. A number of works once believed to have been written by Scotus are now known to have been misattributed. There were already concerns about this within two centuries of his death, when the 16th-century logician Jacobus Naveros noted inconsistencies between these texts and his commentary on the Sentences, leading him to doubt whether he had written any logical works at all.Ashworth 1987 The Questions on the Prior Analytics (In Librum Priorum Analyticorum Aristotelis Quaestiones) were also discovered to be mistakenly attributed. In 1922, Grabmann showed that the logical work De modis significandi was actually by Thomas of Erfurt, a 14th-century logician of the modist school. Thus the claim that Martin Heidegger wrote his habilitation thesis on ScotusDie Kategorien- und Bedeutungslehre des Duns Scotus (Duns Scotus's Doctrine of Categories and Meaning, 1916. is only half true, as the second part is actually based on the work by Erfurt.  Metaphysics   Realism  Scotus is generally considered to be a realist (as opposed to a nominalist) in that he treated universals as real. He attacks a position close to that later defended by Ockham, arguing that things have a common nature ‚Äì for example the humanity common to Socrates, Plato, and Plutarch.  Univocity of being  He followed Aristotle in asserting that the subject matter of metaphysics is \\"being qua being\\" (ens inquantum ens). Being in general (ens in communi), as a univocal notion, was for him the first object of the intellect. The doctrine of the univocity of being implies the denial of any real distinction between essence and existence. Aquinas had argued that in all finite being (i.e. all except God) the essence of a thing is distinct from its existence. Scotus rejected the distinction. Scotus argued that we cannot conceive of what it is to be something, without conceiving it as existing. We should not make any distinction between whether a thing exists (si est) and what it is (quid est) for we never know whether something exists unless we have some concept of what we know to exist.Opus Oxoniense I iii 1‚Äì2, quoted in Grenz 2005, p. 55  Individuation  Scotus elaborates a distinct view on hylomorphism, with three important strong theses that differentiate him. He held: 1) that there exists matter that has no form whatsoever, or prime matter, as the stuff underlying all change, against Aquinas (cf. his Quaestiones in Metaphysicam 7, q. 5; Lectura 2, d. 12, q. un.), 2) that not all created substances are composites of form and matter (cf. Lectura 2, d. 12, q. un., n. 55), that is, that purely spiritual substances do exist, and 3) that one and the same substance can have more than one substantial form ‚Äì for instance, humans have at least two substantial forms, the soul and the form of the body (forma corporeitas) (cf. Ordinatio 4, d. 11, q. 3, n. 54). He argued for an original principle of individuation (cf. Ordinatio 2, d. 3, pars 1, qq. 1‚Äì6), the \\"haecceity\\" as the ultimate unity of a unique individual (haecceitas, an entity's 'thisness'), as opposed to the common nature (natura communis) feature existing in any number of individuals. For Scotus, the axiom stating that only the individual exists is a dominating principle of the understanding of reality. For the apprehension of individuals, an intuitive cognition is required, which gives us the present existence or the non-existence of an individual, as opposed to abstract cognition. Thus the human soul, in its separated state from the body, will be capable of knowing the spiritual intuitively.  Formal distinction  Like other realist philosophers of the period (such as Aquinas and Henry of Ghent) Scotus recognised the need for an intermediate distinction that was not merely conceptual but not fully real or mind-dependent either. Scotus argued for a formal distinction (distinctio formalis a parte rei), which holds between entities which are inseparable and indistinct in reality but whose definitions are not identical. For example, the personal properties of the Trinity are formally distinct from the Divine essence. Similarly, the distinction between the 'thisness' or haecceity of a thing is intermediate between a real and a conceptual distinction.Honderich p. 209 There is also a formal distinction between the divine attributes and the powers of the soul.  Theology   Voluntarism  Scotus was an Augustinian-Franciscan theologian. He is usually associated with theological voluntarism, the tendency to emphasize God's will and human freedom in all philosophical issues. The main difference between Aquinas's rational theology and that of Scotus is that Scotus believed certain predicates may be applied univocally ‚Äì with exactly the same meaning ‚Äì to God and creatures, whereas Aquinas insisted that this is impossible and that only analogical predication can be employed, in which a word as applied to God has a meaning different from, although related to, the meaning of that same word as applied to creatures. Duns struggled throughout his works in demonstrating his univocity theory against Aquinas's analogy doctrine. Scotus gave the lecture, Lectura I 39, during 1297‚Äì1299 to refute the view that everything is necessary and immutable. He claims that the aim of this lecture has two points (Lectura I 39, ¬ß31): first, to consider the contingency in what is (de contingentia in entibus); second, to consider how God's certain knowledge is compatible with the contingency of things. Scotus tries to defend the validity of Christian theology against the attack of ancient philosophers. The main argument is unpacked in Lectura I 39, ¬ß¬ß49‚Äì53. Scotus argues that a necessary being (God) is able to have contingent knowledge, and that although this knowledge is contingent, it is not necessarily mutable and temporal by that very fact. In Lectura I 39 ¬ß1, Scotus asks, \\"whether God has determinate knowledge of things according to every aspect of their existence, as according to being in the future.\\" He presents a counterview which claims that God cannot have determinate knowledge of the future. To support this counterview, he uses Aristotle's De Interpretatione IX. In the following arguments, Scotus does not attempt to contradict Aristotle. He does not affirm or reject the ideas of Aristotle. The only issue he argues against is the proposition that God cannot have determinate knowledge of the future. Scotus appears to try to fully demonstrate that Aristotle's text is not contradictory to the Christian doctrine of God. Scotus argues that God wills with one single volition (unica volitione) whatever he wills. God has one volition ad intra, but this one volition can be related to many opposite things ad extra. God can simultaneously will one thing at time 1 and the opposite thing at time 2. There are various possible interpretations of Aristotle's De Interpretatione IX. For example, John Buridan (ca. 1300‚Äì1362) thought the Scotistic contingency theory was an Aristotelian view. Buridan's judgment is all the more possible because of at least four reasons: (1) Aristotle's De Interpretatione IX, 19a23-25 can be interpreted like the Scotistic contingency theory; (2) Scotus himself does not refute Aristotle's De Interpretatione IX in Lectura I 39 ¬ß¬ß49‚Äì53; (3) Scotus, rather, tries to formulate his contingency theory with the help of other works of Aristotle in Lectura I 39 ¬ß¬ß51, 54; (4) Scotus introduces the diachronic feature of God's volition to his contingency theory as well as the synchronic feature. Metaphysical argument for the existence of God Duns Scotus argued that it is better to construct a metaphysical argument for the existence of God, rather than the more common physical argument from motionLectura I, d. 2, q. 2, 40 Now efficiency can be considered either as a metaphysical or as a physical property. The metaphysical property is more extensive than the physical for \\"to give existence to another\\" is of broader scope than \\"to give existence by way of movement or change.\\" And even if all existence were given in the latter fashion, the notion of the one is still not that of the other. It is not efficiency as a physical attribute, however, but efficiency as the metaphysician considers it that provides a more effective way of proving God's existence, for there are more attributes in metaphysics than in physics whereby the existence of God can be established. It can be shown, for example, from \\"composition and simplicity,\\" from \\"act and potency,\\" from \\"one and many,\\" from those features which are properties of being. Wherefore, if you find one extreme of the disjunction imperfectly realized in a creature, you conclude that the alternate, the perfect extreme exists in God. Averro√´s, therefore, in attacking Avicenna at the end of Bk. I of the Physics, 14 is incorrect when he claims that to prove that God exists is the job of the physicist alone, because this can be established only by way of motion, and in no other way ‚Äì as if metaphysics began with a conclusion which was not evident in itself, but needed to be proved in physics (For Averro√´s asserts this falsehood at the end of the first book of the Physics). In point of fact, however, [God's existence] can be shown more truly and in a greater variety of ways by means of those metaphysical attributes which characterize being. The proof lies in this that the first efficient cause imparts not merely this fluid existence [called motion] but existence in an unqualified sense, which is still more perfect and widespread. favoured by Aquinas,Summa Contra Gentiles, I, 13 http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles1.htm#13 following Aristotle.\\"We shall first set forth the arguments by which Aristotle proceeds to prove that God exists.\\" SCG I, 13.2 http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles1.htm#13 Though the version in De Primo Principio is the most complete and final version, the Ordinatio proof is usually offered. However, the De Primo version is fascinating and worth looking into for a wider understanding of the argument as well as Scotus's metaphysical underpinnings for his argument for God's existence, but the Ordinatio version will be followed here. Briefly, Scotus begins his proof by explaining that there are two angles we must take in arguing for the existence of an actually infinite being. first from the view of the Relative Properties of God and second from the Absolute Properties of God. Relative properties are those which are predicable of God in relation to creation; absolute properties are those which belong to God whether or not He chose to create. Under the first heading of Relative Properties, Scotus argues for a triple primacy of efficiency, finality and pre-eminence. From there he shows that one primacy implies the others, and finally there can only be one nature that is the First Efficient Cause, Ultimate End, and the Most Perfect Nature. From there the Subtle Doctor discusses the Absolute Properties of God. The First Being is intellectual and volitional, and the intellect and will are identical with the essence of this supreme nature. The First Being is also infinite being. While discussing the infinity of God, Scotus resurrects Anselm's argument and responds to the criticism that Anselm makes an illicit leap from concept to reality. Finally, he gives a definite answer of \\"yes\\" to the question of whether there exists an actually infinite being. The very next question of the Ordinatio deals with the unicity of the nature thus proved to exist. However, the De Primo Principio version concludes with this argument. The proof for the conclusion that \\"some efficient cause is simply first such that neither can it be an effect nor can it, by virtue of something other than itself, cause an effect\\" Ordinatio I.2.43Duns Scotus ‚Äì Ordinatio I/D2/Q2B logicmuseum.com runs like this: # Something can be produced. # It is produced either by itself, nothing, or another. # Not by nothing, for nothing causes nothing. # Not by itself, for an effect never causes itself. # Therefore, by another; call it A. # If A is first, then we have reached the conclusion. # If A is not first, but also an effect, we return to 2). A is produced either by itself, nothing, or another. # From 3) and 4), we say another, B. The ascending series will either continue infinitely or we finally reach something which has nothing prior to it. # An infinite ascending series is impossible. # Therefore, etc. Scotus acknowledges two objections and deals with them accordingly. First is that he begs the question in assuming a first in the series. Here he argues that while many admit an infinite regress in an accidentally ordered series of causes, no philosopher admits infinite regress in an essentially ordered series. Scotus explains the differences between the two and offers proofs for the conclusion that an infinity of essentially ordered causes in a series is impossible.See paragraphs 46‚Äì55 at Duns Scotus ‚Äì Ordinatio I/D2/Q2B logicmuseum.com Second, it is objected that his proof is not really a demonstration since it begins with a contingent premise. That something is produced is contingent and not necessary. Therefore, the proof proceeds from a contingent and not a necessary premise. Scotus says that while that is true, it is utterly manifest that things are produced or effected. But in order to respond, Scotus makes a modal move and reworks the argument. Now he argues from the possibility of production. \\"It is possible that something can be produced\\" is a necessary proposition. From there he is able to conclude that it is possible that the first efficient cause exists, and if it is possible that it exists, then it does exist. He asserts that the last claim will be proved later in the argument.Duns Scotus ‚Äì Ordinatio I/D2/Q2B (See paragraph 56) logicmuseum.com In the Lectura proof, Scotus argues the following way: For more on this argument, see especially Authors/Duns Scotus/Ordinatio/Ordinatio I/D2/Q2B ‚Äì The Logic Museum.  Illuminationism  Scotus argued against the version of illuminationism that had been defended earlier in the century by Henry of Ghent. In his Ordinatio (I.3.1.4) he argued against the sceptical consequences that Henry claimed would follow from abandoning divine illumination. Scotus argued that if our thinking were fallible in the way Henry had believed, such illumination could not, even in principle, ensure \\"certain and pure knowledge.\\" :When one of those that come together is incompatible with certainty, then certainty cannot be achieved. For just as from one premise that is necessary and one that is contingent nothing follows but a contingent conclusion, so from something certain and something uncertain, coming together in some cognition, no cognition that is certain follows (Ordinatio I.3.1.4 n.221).  Immaculate Conception  Perhaps the most influential point of Duns Scotus's theology was his defense of the Immaculate Conception of Mary (i.e., that Mary herself was conceived without sin). At the time, there was a great deal of argument about the subject. The general opinion was that it was appropriately deferential to the Mother of God, but it could not be seen how to resolve the problem that only with Christ's death would the stain of original sin be removed. The great philosophers and theologians of the West were divided on the subject (indeed, even Thomas Aquinas sided with those who denied the doctrine). The feast day had existed in the East (though in the East, the feast is just of the Conception of Mary) since the seventh century and had been introduced in several dioceses in the West as well, even though the philosophical basis was lacking. Citing Anselm of Canterbury's principle, \\"potuit, decuit, ergo fecit\\" (He [i.e., God] could do it, it was appropriate, therefore He did it), Duns Scotus devised the following argument: Mary was in need of redemption like all other human beings, but through the merits of Jesus' crucifixion, given in advance, she was conceived without the stain of original sin. God could have brought it about (1) that she was never in original sin, (2) she was in sin only for an instant, (3) she was in sin for a period of time, being purged at the last instant. Whichever of these options was most excellent should probably be attributed to Mary.Ordinatio III, d.3, q.1 This apparently careful statement provoked a storm of opposition at Paris, and suggested the line 'fired France for Mary without spot' in the famous poem \\"Duns Scotus's Oxford,\\" by Gerard Manley Hopkins. Scotus's argument appears in Pope Pius IX's 1854 declaration of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, \\"at the first moment of Her conception, Mary was preserved free from the stain of original sin, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ.\\" Scotus's position was hailed as \\"a correct expression of the faith of the Apostles.\\" Another of Scotus's positions also gained official approval of the Roman Catholic Church: his doctrine on the universal primacy of Christ became the underlying rationale for the feast of Christ the King instituted in 1925. During his pontificate, Pope John XXIII recommended the reading of Duns Scotus's theology to modern theology students.  Veneration  Duns Scotus was long honored as a Blessed by the Order of Friars Minor, as well as in the Archdioceses of Edinburgh and Cologne. In the 19th-century, the process was started seeking his recognition as such by the Holy See, on the basis of a cultus immemorabilis, i.e., one of ancient standing. He was declared Venerable by Pope John Paul II in 1991, who officially recognized his liturgical cult, effectively beatifying him on 20 March 1993.  Later reputation and influence   Later medieval period  Owing to Scotus's early and unexpected death, he left behind a large body of work in an unfinished or unedited condition. His students and disciples extensively edited his papers, often confusing them with works by other writers, in many cases leading to misattribution and confused transmission. Most 13th-century Franciscans followed Bonaventura, but the influence of Scotus (as well as that of his arch-rival William of Ockham) spread in the fourteenth century. Franciscan theologians in the late Middle Ages were thus divided between so-called Scotists and Ockhamists. Fourteenth century followers included Francis of Mayrone (died 1325), Antonius Andreas (died 1320), William of Alnwick (died 1333), and John of Bassolis (died 1347), supposedly Scotus's favourite student.  Sixteenth to nineteenth centuries  His reputation suffered during the English reformation, probably due to its association with the Franciscans. In a letter to Thomas Cromwell about his visit to Oxford in 1535, Richard Layton described how he saw the court of New College full of pages from Scotus's work, \\"the wind blowing them into every corner.\\"R. W. Dixon, History of the Church of England from the Abolition of the Roman Jurisdiction, 1:303 John Leland described the Oxford Greyfriar's library in 1538 (just prior to its dissolution) as an accumulation of \\"cobwebs, moths and bookworms.\\"Catto, Jeremy, \\"Franciscan Learning in England, 1450‚Äì1540\\", in The Religious Orders in Pre-Reformation England, ed. Clarke 2002 When in the sixteenth century the Scotists argued against Renaissance humanism, the term duns or dunce became, in the mouths of the Protestants, a term of abuse and a synonym for one incapable of scholarship. Despite this, Scotism grew in Catholic Europe. Scotus's works were collected into many editions, particularly in the late fifteenth century with the advent of printing. His school was probably at the height of its popularity at the beginning of the seventeenth century; during the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries there were special Scotist chairs, e.g. at Paris, Rome, Coimbra, Salamanca, Alcal√°, Padua, and Pavia. New ideas were included pseudographically in later editions of his work, such as the principle of explosion, now attributed to Pseudo-Scotus. Scotism flourished well into the seventeenth century, and its influence can be seen in such writers as Descartes and Bramhall. Interest dwindled in the eighteenth century, and the revival of scholastic philosophy, known as neo-Scholasticism, was essentially a revival of Thomistic thinking. Gerard Manley Hopkins was able to reconcile his religious calling and his vocation as a poet thanks to his reading of Duns Scotus. His poem As Kingfishers Catch Fire expresses Duns Scotus' ideas on \\"haecceity\\".  Twentieth century  The twentieth century saw a resurgence of interest in Scotus, with a range of assessments of his thought. For one thing, Scotus has received interest from secular philosophers such as Peter King, Gyula Klima, Paul Vincent Spade, and others. For some today, Scotus is one of the most important Franciscan theologians and the founder of Scotism, a special form of Scholasticism. He came out of the Old Franciscan School, to which Haymo of Faversham (died 1244), Alexander of Hales (died 1245), John of Rupella (died 1245), William of Melitona (died 1260), St. Bonaventure (died 1274), Cardinal Matthew of Aquasparta (died 1289), John Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury (died 1292), Richard of Middletown (died c. 1300), etc., belonged. He was known as \\"Doctor Subtilis\\" because of the subtle distinctions and nuances of his thinking. Later philosophers in the sixteenth century were less complimentary about his work and accused him of sophistry. This led to the word \\"dunce,\\" which developed from the name \\"Dunse\\" given to his followers in the 1500s, becoming used for \\"somebody who is incapable of scholarship.\\" An important question since the 1960s has revolved over whether Scotus's thought heralded a change in thinking on the nature of 'being,' a change which marked a shift from Aquinas and other previous thinkers; this question has been particularly significant in recent years because it has come to be seen as a debate over the origins of 'modernity.' This line of argument first emerged in the 1960s among popular French philosophers who, in passing, singled out Duns Scotus as the figure whose theory of univocal being changed an earlier approach which Aquinas had shared with his predecessors.Jacques Derrida, L'√âcriture et la diff√©rence, (Paris, 1967), p216; G Deleuze, Diff√©rence et r√©p√©tition, (Paris, 1968), pp. 52‚Äì8, cited in John Marenbon, \\"Aquinas, Radical Orthodoxy, and the importance of truth\\", in Wayne J Hankey and Douglas Hedley, eds, Deconstructing radical orthodoxy: postmodern theology, rhetoric and truth, (Ashgate, 2005), p. 56. Then, in 1990, the historian of philosophy Jean-Francois Courtine argued that, between the time of Aquinas in the mid- thirteenth century and Francisco Su√°rez at the turn of the seventeenth, a fundamentally new approach to being was developed, with Scotus taking a major part in its development.John Marenbon, \\"Aquinas, Radical Orthodoxy, and the importance of truth\\", in Wayne J Hankey and Douglas Hedley, eds, Deconstructing radical orthodoxy: postmodern theology, rhetoric and truth, (Ashgate, 2005), p. 56. During the 1990s, various scholars extended this argument to locate Scotus as the first thinker who succumbed to what Heidegger termed 'onto-theology'. In recent years, this criticism of Scotus has become disseminated in particular through the writings of the 'Radical Orthodox' group of theologians, drawing on John Milbank and Catherine Pickstock. The Radical Orthodox model has been questioned by Daniel Horan and Thomas Williams, both of whom claim that Scotus' doctrine of the univocity of being is a semantic, rather than an ontological theory. Both thinkers cite Ord. 1, d. 3, pars 1, q. 3, n. 163, in which Scotus claims that \\"This [univocally] is how all the authoritative passages one might find on this topic in the Metaphysics or Physics should be interpreted: in terms of the ontological diversity of those things to which the concept is attributed, which is compatible with there being one concept that can be abstracted from them\\". Such a quotation seems to refer to epistemology, with abstracted concepts, rather than with ontology, which Scotus admits can be diverse. In popular media In 2012 Fernando Muraca directed for TVCO and the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate the biopic Blessed Duns Scotus: Defender of the Immaculate Conception in Italian. It centers on the debate at the Paris University with glimpses of his infancy and Franciscan vocation. Adriano Braidotti played adult Scotus and Emanuele Maria Gamboni played child Scotus.

Attacks by the French and British armies against the on the Western Front had been met in 1915 and 1916 by increasing the number and sophistication of trench networks, the original improvised defences of 1914 giving way to a centrally-planned system of trenches in a trench-position and then increasing numbers of trench-positions, to absorb the growing firepower and offensive sophistication of the Entente armies. During the Battle of the Somme (1 July ‚Äì 18 November 1916), the use of defensive lines began to evolve into the defence of the areas between them, using the local troops of the trench holding divisions and (relief divisions), held back beyond the range of Franco-British artillery, to replace front line divisions as they became exhausted. In the winter of 1916‚Äì1917, the use of such divisions and the fortified zones between trench lines was codified and divisions trained in the new defensive tactics. Training was based on the experience of the defensive battles of 1916 and the new principles of fortification, to provide the infrastructure for the new system of defensive battle by and (counter-attack divisions). The new defensive principles and fortifications were used in 1917 to resist the Franco-British offensives. After failures at Verdun in December 1916 and at Arras in April 1917, the system of fortifications defended by supported by divisions counter-attacking from the rear was vindicated during the French attacks of the Nivelle Offensive. The continuation of British attacks at Arras in the wake of the French debacle on the Aisne, led to the highest rate of casualties per day of the war but the system failed again at the Battle of Messines. German defensive tactics reached their ultimate refinement during the Third Battle of Ypres and there were only slight alterations during the defensive battles of late 1918. In the interwar period, German defensive thinking incorporated the new technology of aircraft, tanks, anti-aircraft guns and anti-tank guns in a much deeper defensive system filled with positions for delaying actions, before a counter-attack was made by armoured and mechanised formations. German defensive tactics 1914‚Äì1916 German defensive tactics had been based on the publication of 1906 (Drill Regulations for the Infantry), which expected defensive warfare to be short periods between offensives. On the Somme front, the construction plan ordered by Falkenhayn in January 1915 had been completed. Barbed wire obstacles had been enlarged from one belt wide to two, wide and about apart. Double and triple thickness wire was used and laid high. The front line had been increased from one line to three, apart, the first trench (, battle trench) occupied by sentry groups, the second (, living trench) for the front- trench garrison and the third trench for local reserves. The trenches were traversed and had sentry-posts in concrete recesses built into the parapet. Dugouts had been deepened from to , apart and large enough for An intermediate line of strong points () about behind the front line had also been built. Communication trenches ran back to the reserve line, renamed the second line, which was as well-built and wired as the first line. The second line was built beyond the range of Allied field artillery, to force an attacker to stop and move field artillery forward before assaulting the line. After the (Autumn Battle) in Champagne during late 1915, a third line another back from the was begun in February 1916 and was nearly complete when the Battle of the Somme began. German artillery was organised in a series of (barrage sectors). The Somme defences were crowded towards the front trench, with a regiment having two battalions near the front trench system and the reserve battalion divided between the and the second line, all within of the front line. Tactical revision, 1917 Winter 1916‚Äì1917 =New manuals= alt=German stormtroops training with a flamethrower in a dummy trench system near Sedan, France, May 1917 After the Battle of the Somme (1 July ‚Äì 18 November), General Erich Ludendorff had German defensive doctrine revised. On 1 December, the (OHL, supreme army command) published new tactical instructions, (Principles of Command for Defensive Battle in Positional Warfare), in which the policy of unyielding defence of ground regardless of its tactical value, was replaced. Positions suitable for artillery observation and communication with the rear were to be defended, where an attacking force would \\"fight itself to a standstill and use up its resources while the defenders conserve[d] their strength\\". Defending infantry would fight in areas, with the front divisions in an outpost zone up to deep behind listening posts, with the main line of resistance placed on a reverse slope, in front of artillery observation posts kept far enough back to retain observation over the outpost zone. Behind the main line of resistance was a (main battle zone), a second defensive area deep, also sited as far as possible on ground hidden from enemy observation, while in view of German artillery observers was to be built. A (rear battle zone) further back was to be occupied by the reserve battalion of each regiment. =Somme analysis= Erfahrungen der I Armee in der Sommeschlacht (Experience of the German 1st Army in the Somme Battles), written by Colonel Fritz von Lo√überg, Chief of Staff of the 1st Army was published on 30 January 1917. During the Battle of the Somme, Lo√überg had been able to establish a line of (relief divisions), with the reinforcements from Verdun, which had arrived in greater numbers in September 1916. In his analysis, Lo√überg opposed the granting of discretion to front trench garrisons to retire, as he believed that manoeuvre did not allow the garrisons to evade Allied artillery fire, which could blanket the forward area and would invite opposing infantry to occupy vacant areas. Lo√überg considered that spontaneous withdrawals would disrupt the counter-attack reserves as they deployed and further deprive battalion and division commanders of the means to conduct an organised defence, which the dispersal of infantry over a wider area had already made difficult. Lo√überg and other officers had severe doubts as to the ability of relief divisions to arrive on the battlefield in time to conduct a (immediate counter-attack from the deep) from behind the battle zone. The sceptics wanted the Somme practice of fighting in the front line to be retained and authority devolved no further than the battalion, to maintain control ready for a (methodical counter-attack) after by the relief divisions. Ludendorff added the analysis to the new =Field fortification= (Principles of Field Fortification) was published in January 1917 on which new defensive fortifications were to be based, to provide the infrastructure for the new defensive tactics. By April an outpost zone () held by sentries, had been built along the Western Front. Sentries could retreat to larger positions () held by (five men and an NCO per ), who would join the sentries to recapture sentry-posts by ( (immediate counter-attack). Defensive procedures in the battle zone were similar but with greater numbers of men. The front trench system was the sentry line for the battle zone garrison, which was allowed to move away from concentrations of enemy fire, then counter-attack to recover the battle and outpost zones. Such withdrawals were envisaged as occurring on small parts of the battlefield, which had been made untenable by Allied artillery fire, as the prelude to (immediate counter-attack within the position). Such a decentralised battle by large numbers of small infantry detachments would present the attacker with unforeseen obstructions. The further the penetration, the greater would be the density of defenders, equipped with automatic weapons, camouflaged and supported by observed artillery fire. A school was opened in January 1917 to teach infantry commanders the new methods.  is generally translated as counter-attack but the term has other connotations. In German military thinking, it included a sense of intervening and is better understood as interlocking or dovetailing, in which the came under the command of the and joined with the defensive garrison and its fortifications. The term was adopted during the Battle of Arras (9 April ‚Äì 16 May 1917) to replace (relief division), to end confusion over the purpose of divisions held in readiness. There were also calls for each to have the support of an but Ludendorff could not find sufficient divisions for this. James Edmonds, the British official historian, called them special reserve or super counter-attack divisions. Such methods required large numbers of reserve divisions ready to counter-attack, which were obtained by creating divisions, moving some divisions from the eastern front and Operation Alberich () in March 1917, which shortened the front. By the spring, the German army in the west () had accumulated a strategic reserve of Over the winter, certain divisions were trained as but a strict distinction between these divisions and the remaining could not always be maintained. The new system reflected the views of Carl von Clausewitz that defensive battle should not be passive but one of deflection and attack (\\"\\"), with the providing a \\"flashing sword of retaliation\\" (\\"\\"). On 1 January 1917, General Otto von Moser was appointed to lead a new at Solesmes near the Belgian border, to teach the new defensive thinking, using a training ground and a Testing and Instructional Division at full establishment for demonstrations. The first course from 8 to 16 February was attended by about of the who attended morning lectures and afternoon exercises and a second course run from 20 to 28 February included guest officers from the Eastern Front and three Austro-Hungarian army observers. The third course from 4 to 12 March included officers from other armies of the Central Powers and then Moser was transferred to take command of the XIV Reserve Corps. Many of the students accepted the new defensive thinking but Lo√überg and other dissenters objected to discretion to retreat being given to the front garrison. A second school was set up at Sedan for the officers of . During the British preparatory bombardment of Messines Ridge before the attack on 7 June, the 24th Division was relieved by the 35th Division and the 40th Division by the 3rd Bavarian Division, the local and these were replaced by the 7th Division and the 1st Guard Reserve Division, unfamiliar with the area and not trained . Some were retained as they were rebuilt after spending time in the line; the 24th Division was given six weeks' rest and reconstituted as the of Group Aubers before returning to Flanders on 11 August. The 23rd Reserve Division acted as a from 23 June to 29 July, spent August recuperating and September as an for (Group) Dixmude, before being rushed to Group Ypres on 20 September to relieve the 2nd Guard Division. =Training= When the 183rd Division arrived in Flanders became an for . The divisional artillery had been reorganised, with the medium and heavy guns participating in conventional artillery bombardments and the three battalions of Field Artillery Regiment 183 being divided between the three infantry regiments. Each infantry regiment received two assault batteries and a platoon of Reserve Engineer Battalion 16, to provide observed and direct fire. Training in the new role led to infantry companies being reorganised and new specialisms being introduced. The three platoons in each company became a rifle section, an assault group, a grenade-launcher troop and a light machine-gun section. The use of hand grenades became more important and coloured flares were used as the quickest way to signal to the rear. =Defensive tactics= The German army distinguished between a hasty counter-attack ( immediate counter-attack from within the position) to prevent an opponent from consolidating captured positions and a methodical counter- attack (), which took place after a period for reconnaissance, reinforcement and preliminary artillery fire. The new tactics required commanders to act on their initiative and troops to perform complicated manoeuvres in battle, which could only be implemented through a comprehensive training programme to make it possible. divisions were to wait in readiness at the rear of the defensive zone to join the more immediate engagements, if troops held in reserve by the were insufficient to restore the position. With the increasing Allied superiority in munitions and manpower, attackers might still penetrate to the second (artillery protection) line, leaving German garrisons isolated in (, resistance nests), still inflicting losses and disorganisation on the attackers. As the attackers tried to capture the and dig in near the German second line, and of the divisions would advance from the into the battle zone, in an immediate counter-attack (, immediate counter-attack from the deep). When immediate counter-attacks failed, the divisions would take to prepare a (methodical counter-attack), provided that the lost ground was essential for the retention of the main position. Third Battle of Ypres =31 July= The British advance in the centre of the front had caused serious concern to the German commanders. Penetration of the defensive system was expected but the advance in the centre of the attack had not been anticipated. At noon, the British advance on the Gheluvelt Plateau to the south had been stopped by the local German defenders and their artillery. In the centre, regiments of the 221st and 50th Reserve Divisions, the divisions at the rear of the Group Ypres defensive zone, advanced over the Broodseinde‚ÄìPasschendaele ridge, unseen by British reconnaissance aircraft. The regiments began their advance from and the German artillery began a creeping barrage at along the centre of the British front. The regiments drove back the three most advanced British brigades, inflicting casualties, recaptured the Zonnebeke‚ÄìLangemarck road and St Julien, before the advance was stopped on the black line (second objective) by mud, the British artillery and machine-gun fire. The divisions had little success on the northern flank of the Anglo-French attack, where the attackers had time to dig in. After losing many men to British artillery-fire while advancing around Langemarck, the Germans managed to push back a small British bridgehead on the east bank of the Steenbeek; the French repulsed the Germans around St Janshoek and followed up to capture Bixschoote. Counter- attacks in the afternoon by the on the southern flank, intended to recapture Westhoek Ridge, were able to advance a short distance from Glencorse Wood before British artillery-fire and a counter-attack pushed them back again. =22 September= The leading regiment of an division was to advance into the zone of the front division, with its other two regiments moving forward in close support. The support and reserve assembly areas in the were termed and , analogies with the structure of a Roman legion. divisions were accommodated behind the front line and began their advance to their assembly areas in the rear zone (), ready to intervene in the main battle zone (). After the defeat of Menin Road Ridge, the German defensive deployment was changed. In August, German had two regiments of three battalions each in the front position, with the third regiment in reserve. The front battalions had needed to be relieved much more frequently than expected due to constant British bombardments and the weather; units had become mixed up. Reserve regiments had not been able to intervene quickly, leaving front battalions unsupported until divisions arrived, some hours after the commencement of the attack. The deployment was changed to increase the number of troops in the front zone. By 26 September all three regiments of the front-line division were forward, each holding an area wide and deep; one battalion was placed in the front-line, the second in support and the third in close reserve. The battalions were to move forward successively, to engage fresh enemy battalions, which had leap-frogged through those that had delivered the first attack. The divisions were to deliver an organised attack with artillery support later in the day, before the British could consolidate their new line. The change was intended to remedy the neutralisation of the front division reserves, which had been achieved by the British artillery on 20 September, so that they could intervene before the divisions arrived. On 22 September, new tactical requirements were laid down: more artillery counter-bombardment was to be used between British attacks, half against British artillery and half against infantry, increased raiding was ordered to induce the British to hold their positions in greater strength, giving German artillery a denser target; better artillery observation was demanded in the battle zone, to increase the accuracy of German artillery fire when British troops advanced into it and quicker counter-attacks were to be made. =30 September= Following the costly defeats of Menin Road on 20 September and Polygon Wood on 26 September, the German commanders made more changes to the defensive organisation and altered their counter-attack tactics, which had been negated by the British combination of limited attack and much greater artillery firepower than August. divisions had engaged in \\"an advance to contact during mobile operations\\" in August, which had achieved several costly defensive successes. German counter-attacks in September had been \\"assaults on reinforced field positions\\", due to the short British infantry advances and emphasis on defeating (immediate counter-attacks) in the position or from the deep. The period of dry weather and clear skies which began in early September, had greatly increased the effectiveness of British air observation and artillery fire. German counter-attacks were defeated with heavy casualties, after arriving too late to take advantage of disorganisation. The British changes meant that a defence in depth had been swiftly established on reverse slopes, behind standing barrages, in dry, clear weather, with specialist air reconnaissance for observation of German troop movements and improved contact patrolling and ground-attack operations by the RFC. German artillery which was able to fire, despite British counter-battery shelling, became unsystematic due to uncertainty over the whereabouts of German infantry and British infantry benefited from the opposite. On 28 September Albrecht von Thaer, Staff Officer at wrote that the experience was \\"awful\\" and that he did not know what to do. Ludendorff later wrote that he had regularly discussed the situation with General Hermann von Kuhl and Lo√überg, to try to find a remedy for the overwhelming British attacks. Ludendorff ordered a strengthening of the forward garrisons by the ground holding divisions and all machine-guns, including those of the support and reserve battalions of the front line regiments, were sent into the forward zone, to form a cordon of four to eight guns every . The regiment of each division, was placed behind each front division in the artillery protective line behind the forward battle zone, which increased the ratio of divisions to The regiment was to be available to launch counter-attacks while the British were consolidating; the remainder of each division was to be withheld for a (methodical counter-attack) a day or two later. Between British attacks, the divisions were to make more spoiling attacks. A 4th Army operation order on 30 September pointed out that the German position in Flanders was restricted by the local topography, the proximity of the coast and the Dutch frontier, which made local withdrawals impossible. The instructions of 22 September were to be followed, with more bombardment by field artillery, using at least half of the heavy artillery ammunition, for observed fire on infantry positions in captured pillboxes, command posts, machine-gun nests, on duck board tracks and field railways. Gas bombardment was to be increased, on forward positions and artillery emplacements, when the wind allowed. Every effort was to be made to induce the British to reinforce their forward positions, where the German artillery could engage them, by making spoiling attacks to recapture pillboxes, improve defensive positions and harass the British infantry, with patrols and diversionary bombardments. From the Germans attacked and counter- attacked at least . British intelligence predicted the German changes in an intelligence summary of 1 October, foreseeing the big German counter-attack planned for 4 October. =7‚Äì13 October= On 7 October, the 4th Army abandoned the reinforcement of the front defence zone, after the \\"black day\\" of 4 October. Front line regiments were dispersed again, with reserve battalions moved back behind the artillery protective line and divisions organised to intervene as swiftly as possible, despite the risk of being devastated by the British artillery. Counter-battery fire against British artillery was to be increased to protect the divisions as they advanced. Ludendorff insisted on an advanced zone, () deep, to be occupied by a thin line of sentries with a few machine-guns. The sentries were to retire on the main line of resistance () at the back of this advanced zone when attacked, while the artillery was quickly to barrage the area in front of it. Support and reserve battalions of the front-line and divisions, would gain time to move up to the main line of resistance, where the battle would be fought, if artillery-fire had not stopped the British infantry advance. An division was to be placed behind each front-line division, with instructions to ensure that it reached the British before they could consolidate. If a swift counter- attack was not possible, there was to be a delay to organise a methodical counter-attack, after ample artillery preparation. Armin ordered on 11 October that the - and - divisions of groups Staden, Ypres and part of were to take turns in the front line, becoming more of a role than an identity. The revised defensive scheme was promulgated on 13 October, over Rupprecht's objections. Artillery-fire was to replace the machine-gun defence of the forward zone as far as possible, which Rupprecht believed would allow the British artillery too much freedom to operate. The thin line of sentries of one or two (thirteen men and a light machine-gun each) in company sectors proved inadequate, as the British were easily able to attack them and lift prisoners. At the end of October, the sentry line was replaced by a conventional outpost system of double . The German defensive system had become based on two divisions, holding a front wide and deep, half the area that two divisions previously were expected to hold. The necessity of such reinforcement was caused by the weather, devastating British artillery-fire and the decline in the numbers and quality of German infantry. Concealment () was emphasised, to protect the divisions from British fire power, by avoiding anything resembling a trench system, in favour of dispersal in crater fields. Such a method was only made feasible by the rapid rotation of units; battalions of the front-divisions were relieved after two days and divisions every six days. On 23 October, the commander was given command of the , creating a new two-division tactical unit. The quicker rotation of divisions led to the distinction between divisions and , becoming tenuous and more one of the task rather than the division. In late November, Ludendorff ordered all of the armies on the Western Front to adopt the new system. Cambrai, 1918 and post-war German defensive battle tactics reached their culmination at the Third Battle of Ypres; the counter-offensive at Cambrai was a conventional and in 1918, minor changes to nomenclature and the and system, were made because of mechanisation within the army. The (outpost zone) became the (advanced battle zone) at the front, with the (main battle zone), the (greater battle zone), the (rear position) further back then the (rear battle zone). divisions were based from behind the front line and expected to fight the main defensive battle in the . The was held with as few troops as possible, exploiting flanking fire from machine-guns and single field guns. The front line was along the forward edge of the and covered the field artillery positions supporting the troops in the . Further back were positions for the counter-attack troops of the , to provide time for the divisions to close up and counter-attack along with the local reserves. On 20 July 1918, Ludendorff sent Lo√überg to report on the conditions in the Marne Salient, who found that the system devised for the operations in Flanders in 1917 was unworkable in the terrain of the Vesle and Aisne valleys. The unspoilt countryside was full of trees and standing crops; terrain dispersed defences were incapable of resisting tank attacks from the flanks and rear with so much cover for the attackers. Defences were changed back a line of observation groups in front of the main line of resistance, the groups having increased firepower, to force an attacker to deploy sooner. Delaying actions, moving back through lines of observation were developed into a holding action (). The relative success of the defensive system at Ypres in 1917 was not repeated in 1918 on the Santerre in Picardy or the downlands west of Cambrai. The could be overrun behind creeping barrages at night or in twilight and there were too few divisions to counter-attack, those present being capable only of local attacks or reinforcement of the defenders. German divisions were smaller than earlier in the war, had more machine-guns and better command arrangements but the system of linked and was most demanding of manpower; British attacks in late 1918 rarely outnumbered the defenders, relying on initiative and surprise. Writing in 1939, Wynne described contemporary German defensive principles that resembled the defence of Flanders in 1917, with the depth of the defensive position increased to about filled with lines of resistance () from which to fight a delaying action. Static defences would be backed by mechanised and motorised divisions ready to use speed, firepower and shock in a (counter-attack from the deep). Inside the defensive position, anti-aircraft, anti-tank guns and mobile anti-tank guns would inflict losses on the opposing tanks and aircraft that were supporting the infantry attack but the fixed defences of the Siegfried Line were less important than the \\"flashing sword of retaliation\\".

As a small special forces unit, it specialized in irregular warfare. Intended to combat the North Korean (NK) commandos who had been effective at infiltration and disruption behind United Nations (UN) lines, the Eighth Army Ranger Company was formed at the height of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter in September 1950 and was the first U.S. Army Ranger unit created since World War II. The company went into action as a part of the 25th Infantry Division during the UN advance into North Korea in October and November. It was best known for its defense of Hill 205 against an overwhelming Chinese attack during the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River which resulted 41 of the 51 Rangers becoming casualties. The company later undertook a number of other combat missions during late 1950 and early 1951, conducting infiltration, reconnaissance and raiding. It scouted Chinese positions during Operation Killer and struck behind Chinese lines during Operation Ripper before being deactivated at the end of March 1951. The company saw 164 days of continuous combat and was awarded a Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. Military historians have since studied the economy of force of the company's organization and utilization. Although the experimental unit led to the creation of 15 more Ranger companies, historians disagree on whether the unit was employed properly as a special forces unit and whether it was adequately equipped for the missions it was designed to conduct.  Origins  Following the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950, the North Korean People's Army had invaded the Republic of Korea (ROK) with 90,000 well-trained and equipped troops who had easily overrun the smaller and more poorly equipped Republic of Korea Army. The United States (U.S.) and United Nations (UN) subsequently intervened, beginning a campaign to prevent South Korea from collapsing. The U.S. troops engaged the North Koreans first at the Battle of Osan, and were badly defeated by the better-trained North Koreans on 5 July. By August, U.S. and UN forces had been pushed back to the Pusan Perimeter. At the same time, North Korean agents began to infiltrate behind UN lines and attack military targets and cities. UN units, spread out along the Pusan Perimeter, were having a difficult time repelling these units as they were untrained in combating guerrilla warfare. North Korean special forces units like the NK 766th Independent Infantry Regiment had been successful in defeating ROK troops, prompting Army Chief of Staff General J. Lawton Collins to order the creation of an elite force which could \\"infiltrate through enemy lines and attack command posts, artillery, tank parks, and key communications centers or facilities.\\" All U.S. Army Ranger units had been disbanded after World War II because they required time-consuming training, specialization, and expensive equipment. Yet with the defeat of the NK 766th Regiment at the Battle of P'ohang-dong, and the strength of U.S. infantry units in question, U.S. commanders felt recreating Ranger units was essential to beginning a counteroffensive. Second Lieutenant Ralph Puckett, the first commander of the company. In early August as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter was beginning, the Eighth United States Army ordered Lieutenant Colonel John H. McGee, the head of its G-3 Operations Miscellaneous Division, to seek volunteers for a new experimental Army Ranger unit. McGee was given only seven weeks to organize and train the unit before it was sent into combat, as commanders felt the need for Rangers was dire, and that existing soldiers could be trained as Rangers in a relatively short period of time. Because of this limitation, volunteers were solicited only from existing Eighth Army combat units in Korea, though subsequent Ranger companies were able to recruit Ranger veterans from World War II. From the Eighth Army replacement pool, McGee recruited Second Lieutenant Ralph Puckett, newly commissioned from West Point and with no combat experience, to serve as the company commander. Second Lieutenants Charles Bunn and Barnard Cummings, Jr., became Puckett's two platoon leaders. Several hundred enlisted men volunteered from the Eighth Army, though few had combat experience. Through a quick and informal selection process, Puckett picked the men to fill out the company based on weapons qualifications, athleticism, and duty performance. There was no time to administer physical fitness tests for the applicants, and unmarried men younger than 26 were preferred. Recruits were told they would receive no hazard pay. Once Puckett had selected 73 enlisted men,Subsequent Ranger companies were allowed a strength of between 112 and 122 men, as compared to the standard infantry company strength of 211. () the Eighth Army Ranger Company was formally organized at Camp Drake, Japan, on 25 August 1950. Three days later, it sailed from Sasebo to Pusan, South Korea, aboard the ferry Koan Maru. Upon arrival, the company was sent to the newly established Eighth Army Ranger Training Center for seven weeks of specialized training. This took place at \\"Ranger Hill\\" near Kijang, where the men became skilled in reconnaissance, navigation, long-range patrolling, motorized scouting, setting up roadblocks, maintaining camouflage and concealment, and adjusting indirect fire. They also undertook frequent live fire exercises, many at night, simulating raids, ambushes and infiltration, using North Korean operatives that were known to be hiding in the area as an opposing force. Adopting techniques that had been established during World War II, they worked 60 hours per week, running each day and frequently undertaking speed marches. The troops also all shaved their hair into mohawks, under orders of the officers who wanted to build esprit de corps. Of the original 76 men who started the course, 12 either dropped out or were injured, and as a result 10 South Korean troops, known as KATUSAs, were attached to the unit to fill its ranks.The KATUSAs were attached to the unit and employed as translators and guides only, and were not technically qualified as Rangers. ()  Organization  Established to experiment with the notion of deploying small light infantry units that specialized in infiltration and irregular warfare to Korea, the Eighth Army Ranger Company was created with an organization that was unique to other U.S. Army units. Consisting of three officers and 73 enlisted men,Later, the establishment of Ranger companies was increased and they were organized in three platoons, and equipped with additional heavy weapons. () it was organized as a company of two platoons based on the Table of Organization and Equipment documents used to raise Ranger units during World War II. Within each platoon, a headquarters element of five men (a platoon leader, platoon sergeant, platoon guide, and 2 messengers) provided command and control. In addition, both platoons had thirty-six men in three squads - two assault squads and one heavy weapons squad - and were furnished with a 60 mm M2 mortar, two M20 Super Bazookas, and a M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle as well as the M1 Garand and M2 Carbines that the majority of the men were armed with. One man from each platoon was designated as a sniper. The company was assigned no vehicles, and no provision was made for mess facilities or to provide medical assets. As no independent battalion-level headquarters existed in Korea, the company had to be attached to a higher formation at all times. Employing the Sub Intelligent Numbers Selector theory that assigned non-descript unit names and randomized numerical designations to formations in order to disguise their role from the enemy, the company was designated the 8213th Army Unit. Upon formation, it was decided that the company would be considered an ad hoc, or provisional unit, which meant it did not have a permanent lineage and was only a temporary formation, akin to a task force. This decision was unique to the Eighth Army Ranger Company, as subsequent companies assumed the lineage of Ranger units from World War II, and veterans later expressed resentment with the choice as it prevented the company from accruing its own campaign streamers or unit decorations. While subsequent Ranger companies were authorized shoulder sleeve insignia with the distinctive black and red scroll of their World War II predecessors, the Eighth Army Ranger Company wore the shoulder patch of the Eighth United States Army, which commanded all UN troops in Korea.  History   Advance  By the time the Eighth Army Ranger Company completed training on 1 October, UN forces had broken out of the Pusan Perimeter following an amphibious landing at Inchon. The company was subsequently committed to the offensive from Pusan Perimeter. On 8 October it was redesignated the 8213th Army Unit signifying its activation as a unit, and on 14 October Puckett took an advance force to join the US 25th Infantry Division at Taejon, as part of the US IX Corps. The Rangers' first assignment was to probe north to Poun with the division's reconnaissance elements in search of pockets of guerrillas which had been isolated during the UN breakout from Pusan. The platoons moved to two villages near Poun and began a northward sweep with the 25th Infantry Division. The troops then rapidly moved to Kaesong where they eliminated the last North Korean resistance south of the 38th Parallel. In these missions, the Eighth Army Ranger Company saw frequent combat with small groups of North Korean troops. During this time they also scrounged supplies from local units, including commandeering a jeep, and taking rice and other rations from the countryside. With South Korea liberated, the Rangers led the 25th Infantry Division's advance into North Korea. Acting as a spearhead, they sent out reconnaissance patrols ahead of the divisional main body and set up roadblocks to limit the movement of retreating North Korean forces. The Rangers became a part of \\"Task Force Johnson\\" with the 25th Infantry Division Reconnaissance Company and the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry in November to probe and clear the Uijeongbu, Dongducheon, and Shiny-ri areas of North Korean elements. On 18 November, the Rangers were detached from Task Force Johnson and returned to Kaesong, where they were attached to the 89th Medium Tank Battalion. On 20 November, the 89th Medium Tank Battalion moved to join the renewed UN offensive north to destroy the remaining North Korean troops and advance to the Yalu River. The battalion was designated \\"Task Force Dolvin\\" and ordered to spearhead the drive. At 01:00 that morning they advanced to Kunu-ri, reaching the front lines at Yongdungpo by 16:00.  Hill 205  Map of Chinese troop movements during the Battle of Ch'ongch'on River. On 23 November, the 25th Infantry Division rested in preparation for its final advance to the Yalu, which was to begin the next day at 10:00. As the division spent the day enjoying a Thanksgiving Day meal, the Rangers scouted north of the planned line of departure but made no contact with North Korean forces. On 24 November, the company moved out on time in the center of Task Force Dolvin's advance, riding on tanks from B Company, 89th Tank Battalion, including M4A3 Sherman and M26 Pershings. About into their advance, they rescued 30 U.S. prisoners of war from the 8th Cavalry Regiment who had been captured at the Battle of Unsan but abandoned by the retreating Chinese. At 14:00 they reached their objective at Hill 222. As soon as the Rangers dismounted the tanks, the troops came under mortar fire. One Ranger was subsequently killed, the company's first fatality since its formation. Cummings and 2nd Platoon advanced to the crest of the hill. At that time the tanks of the 89th mistakenly opened fire on the Rangers, causing a number of friendly fire casualties including two killed, before Puckett was able to signal them to stop. The Rangers took up positions on Hill 222 for the night. An additional two men became weather casualties, suffering frostbite that evening as temperatures fell to . Chinese troops chase after retreating 25th Infantry Division troops after the battle. The next day, 25 November, Task Force Dolvin resumed its advance, with 51 Rangers of the Eighth Army Ranger Company continuing north on the 89th's tanks. The troops immediately ran into Chinese resistance as they began to advance. On both flanks, Task Force Dolvin troops encountered sporadic resistance throughout the morning, but were able to capture their objectives. The Eighth Army Ranger Company rode the tanks a further north to Hill 205. As the Rangers and tanks approached the hill they came under mortar and small arms fire, but were able to capture the hill after light Chinese resistance, suffering four states that six Rangers and three KATUSAs were wounded, but other sources do not corroborate this claim. wounded in the process. The Rangers then established a perimeter on the position and spent the remainder of the day fortifying it. The Chinese Second Phase Offensive was launched that evening, with the unprepared UN troops hit all along the Korean front as 300,000 Chinese troops swarmed into Korea. Several kilometers away on the Rangers' left flank, the U.S. 27th Infantry Regiment's E Company was hit with a heavy Chinese attack at 21:00, alerting the Rangers to a pending attack. At 22:00, troops of the Chinese 39th Army began a frontal assault on Hill 205, signaled by drums and whistles. An estimated platoon-sized force of Chinese made the first attack. The Rangers fought back with heavy small arms fire and several pre-sighted artillery concentrations, repulsing this first attack at 22:50. A number of Rangers were wounded in this attack, including Puckett, who refused evacuation. At 23:00 the Chinese launched a second attack which was quickly repelled, as was a third attack several minutes later. Both of these attacks were an estimated company in strength. The Rangers inflicted heavy casualties each time as a result of a well-established defensive perimeter, though the platoon of tanks at the foot of the hill opposite the Chinese attack were unable to assist the Rangers, as the crews had no experience in night operations. By 23:50 the Chinese began attacking in greater numbers, with an estimated two companies advancing at a time, moving to within hand grenade range. The Rangers began to run low on ammunition while their casualties continued to mount, and Puckett was wounded again. Over the course of several hours the Chinese launched a fourth and a fifth attack, each of which was narrowly pushed back by the Rangers. The Rangers were then ordered to fix bayonets in preparation for the next attack. At 02:45, the Chinese began a sixth and final attack with a heavy mortar barrage which inflicted heavy casualties on the remaining Rangers, including Cummings, who was killed instantly by a mortar shell and Puckett, who was severely wounded. The Chinese then sent a reinforced battalion of 600 infantry at the hill, while simultaneously striking other elements of Task Force Dolvin, preventing artillery from providing effective support.Although US histories generally agree that the Chinese 39th Army launched a major offensive against Task Force Dolvin on the night of 25 November, Commander Wu Xinquan of the 39th Army could not recall whether any attack orders were issued on 25 November. However, Wu did state that during the strategy meeting that took place that night, the Chinese 345th Regiment reported that one of its infantry battalions had been badly mauled by Task Force Dolvin. () Without artillery support of their own, and low on ammunition, they were overwhelmed by the subsequent Chinese attack. The Chinese forces swarmed the hill in overwhelming numbers, and many of the Rangers were shot and killed in their foxholes or stabbed with bayonets. The company was destroyed in the fighting, with the survivors retreating from the hill. Three Rangers later chased away Chinese troops as they tried to capture the severely wounded Puckett.Two of the Rangers who rescued Puckett, Private First Class Billy G. Walls and Sergeant David L. Pollock, were awarded the Silver Star Medal for their actions. () The remaining Rangers gathered at an assembly area at the base of the hill under First Sergeant Charles L. Pitts, the highest ranking unwounded member of the company, and withdrew. The Rangers suffered over 80 percent casualties on Hill 205; of the 51 who captured the hill, 10 were killed or missing and another 31 wounded.  1951 raids  The heavy casualties on Hill 205 rendered the company ineffective, and for several weeks it was only capable of being used to conduct routine patrols or as a security force for divisional headquarters elements. Puckett was evacuated to recover from his wounds. On 5 December, Captain John P. Vann assumed command of the company, and Captain Bob Sigholtz, a veteran of Merrill's Marauders, was also assigned to the unit. Yet with the company's casualties being replaced by regular soldiers who had no Ranger training it did not return to full combat capability after the Hill 205 battle. The replacements were subsequently given cursory training between missions, but U.S. military historians contend that the inexperienced replacements dramatically decreased the usefulness of the company as a special forces unit. The company participated in a few isolated missions in late 1950 and early 1951, including the recapture of Ganghwa Island from Chinese forces while attached to the Turkish Brigade. It advanced with the 25th Division during Operation Killer in late February as part of an effort to push Chinese forces north of the Han River. During that operation the company was employed as a scouting force, probing the strength of Chinese formations as they launched raids and attacks on the 25th Infantry Division. The frequent scouting missions were also intended to draw Chinese fire and determine the locations of their units. Returning to action, the company's 2nd Platoon effected a crossing of the Han River at 22:00 on 28 February 1951 for a raid on Yangsu-ri to destroy Chinese positions and capture a prisoner. Despite difficulties crossing the icy river the platoon moved into the village after 23:00, finding it deserted. After probing north and finding no Chinese, the Rangers returned to UN lines. On 1 March, 1st Platoon conducted a follow- up mission to scout railroad tunnels north of the village but had to turn back as heavy ice blocked its boats from crossing, and several men fell into the freezing water. During the first days of March, the company stepped up its patrols across the Han River, this time with a renewed emphasis on determining the locations of Chinese forces and pinpointing their strongpoints, in preparation for the next major offensive.  Operation Ripper  Vann was replaced by Captain Charles G. Ross on 5 March 1951. At the same time, the UN began Operation Ripper to drive the Chinese north of the 38th Parallel. As the 25th Infantry Division attacked forward, the Eighth Army Ranger Company scouted ahead of the general attack, reconnoitering Chinese positions. For much of the month they were utilized as a flank security force for the 25th Infantry Division, holding successive blocking positions as elements of the division advanced. On 18 March, they were sent a further north of the front lines to set up an ambush at a road and railway line which ran through a defile. Chinese troops were retreating through this defile, and at 15:30 on 19 March Ross assembled the men nearby. Through the night they established roadblocks and prepared to attack oncoming Chinese troops, but none passed through the area, and Ross took the company back to UN lines at 05:00. The company's final mission came on 27 March, an infiltration north to Changgo-ri to reconnoiter the size of a Chinese force holding there and to prevent it from setting a rearguard. The 25th Infantry Division would then attack and overwhelm the Chinese concentration more easily. The Rangers began their advance at 22:00 and arrived at the village at 01:00. Ross then ordered 2nd Platoon to conduct a stealth attack into the village which destroyed an outpost and a food cache and caught the Chinese troops by surprise. The Rangers temporarily succeeded in pushing the sizable Chinese force out of the village and into a trench, inflicting heavy casualties on it in the process. The Chinese, estimated to be a battalion, subsequently attempted to counterattack but were repulsed by the Rangers. Following this, Ross ordered the company to withdraw back to UN lines, arriving there at 05:00 having suffered no casualties in the action. The Eighth Army Ranger Company was deactivated on 31 March 1951. Some of its equipment was subsequently consolidated with the 5th Ranger Infantry Company, which was newly arrived in Korea and had been assigned to the 25th Infantry Division. The men of the new Ranger company had formally attended Ranger School, though they were inexperienced and less effective in their initial actions with the division. In the meantime, most of the men of the former Eighth Army Ranger Company were transferred to other units of the 25th Infantry Division, while those who were paratrooper qualified through the United States Army Airborne School were allowed to transfer to the 187th Regimental Combat Team or one of the other Ranger companies then beginning to arrive in Korea. During its brief existence, the Eighth Army Ranger Company saw 164 days of combat and was awarded a Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.  Analysis  In September 1950, on Collins' orders the Ranger Training Center was moved to Fort Benning, Georgia, and in October the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Ranger Companies began training. The effective employment of the Eighth Army Ranger Company had demonstrated the viability of the concept to Army planners, and the subsequent Chinese attacks in November reinforced the need for more such units. As a result, the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th Ranger Companies were ordered to form. Altogether, another fifteen Ranger companies would be formed in 1950 and 1951, and six of them would see combat in Korea. Subsequent military science studies of the use of Rangers during the Korean War have focused on analysing their economy of force by looking at how well the U.S. military employed them as special forces. In an analysis of the operations of all Ranger units in the Korean War, Major Chelsea Y. Chae proposed in a 1996 thesis to the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College that they were misused and ineffective in general, and that in particular the Eighth Army Ranger Company had been poorly employed. Chae noted that the Ranger formations' lack of support personnel made them a logistic and administrative liability, as they had to be attached to conventional units for support. Furthermore, he argued that the Rangers' small formation sizes meant that they lacked the manpower to conduct basic tactical maneuvers, and their employment with divisional elements did not provide them with the intelligence information necessary for effective infiltration operations. He concluded that these problems were due to a \\"lack of understanding of Ranger capabilities, limitations inherent in Rangers‚Äì‚Äî‚Äî¬∞' force structure, and basic distrust of elite forces.\\" However, retired Colonel Thomas H. Taylor, a military historian, contended in his 1996 book that in spite of their original purpose of short range infiltration, the Eighth Army Ranger Company was employed well for the missions they conducted, most of which were reactionary and borne out of a need to rapidly counter North Korean and Chinese attacks. Taylor noted that particularly in their earlier missions, the Rangers had been successful at operating as a night combat force, a skill that the rest of the U.S. forces in Korea were largely untrained in. Taylor also believed that the Rangers, who were drawn from replacement and occupation units in Japan, effectively gave the 25th Infantry Division an extra force it would not otherwise have possessed, allowing it to employ its conventional forces elsewhere. Taylor praised division commander Major General William B. Kean for his employment of the Rangers, and argued that the successes of the subsequent Ranger companies validated the existence of the Eighth Army Ranger Company.

The District Tourism Promotion Council started by Bose in 1986 and replicated by the Government of Kerala in all the districts in the state, has been the nodal institution behind making Kerala God's own country. The national tourism policy recommends that this institution be replicated in all districts in the country. Dhanwanthari Kendras initiated by Bose as institutions which provide ancillary medical facilities in hospitals, have been replicated in all districts in Kerala. The first ever attempt in India to provide medicines at discounted rate was started as part of Dhanwanthari Kendra. Later on Kerala government set up institutions to provide medicines at fair price on a regular basis. Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojana Kendra may be seen as a great culmination of a humble initiative in that direction taken 32 years back by Bose. 'The File to Field' program successfully launched in various places in Kerala as an effective mass contact program, has proved to be an administrative innovation which could redress the grievance of the public and accelerate development of backward rural areas. Union Minister of Tourism, Shri. Alphons Kannanthanam, is on record that this is the precursor to UN award-winning public service delivery system spearheaded by the then Chief Minister of Kerala . The Gramotsava program initiated by Bose as sub collector, for the time bound development of rural areas, was officially evaluated by the Kerala Government as an effective development model worthy of replication and Government repeated the program in 200 panchayaths. Sanjeevani Kendra, setup on the banks of the Ramsar site, Sasthamkotta lake, with an extensive medicinal garden with facilities for Ayurveda treatment and research, was replicated in other parts of the state and Forest department adopted it as one of their flag ship projects. In order to empower women and develop entrepreneurship among them, the Annapoorna society was set up in Kollam in 1986. They could run working women's hostel, undertake outdoor catering, establish mobile restaurants for street food, and undertake capacity building to equip women for income generating economic development activities. This has been evaluated as the forerunner or the renowned Kudumbashri Self Help Groups in Kerala. The micro credit scheme introduced among the fisherwomen in Kollam district, popularly known as ration card loan, could save this marginalised section of society from the clutches of the usurious money lenders. The first house boat in the state was introduced in Kollam during Bose's tenure and today houseboats are a major source of income in the tourism sector. Adventure sports got a boost in the state through the Adventure Park set up in Kollam in 1985. Subsequently, he could establish an Adventure Academy for this purpose. The project Water Save launched to protect the Sasthamcotta fresh water lake in a campaign mode by raising a green belt around the lake, preventing soil erosion and removing restrictive practises, received the UN - sponsored Bremen Partnership Award from Germany. The Labour Agenda initiated by Bose was adopted by the Government of Kerala for implementing sustainable developmental and welfare programs among the workers, was selected by the UN as Global Good Practice. As Chairman of the Atomic Energy Education Society, Bose could set up a television studio for edutainment and introduce science fairs and youth festivals. As MD NAFED, Bose could check corruption, bring the guilty to books and put the organization back on rails. When the price of essential commodities spiralled, Bose initiated the 'Easy market' scheme and the 'Farm gate to Home gate' direct marketing scheme for vegetables and horticulture produce. When onion price skyrocketed in Delhi, successful market intervention was made to sell onions at thirty percent less than the market price. This has been acknowledged by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in a letter. \\"His penchant for innovation was markedly manifest in his efforts at market intervention during the price hike of essential commodities, when he was heading NAFED in the Department of Agriculture.\\" As the Administrator of the National Museum, Dr Bose launched a 100-day programme which spelt out specific measures to revamp and revitalise the institution. Most of the improvements suggested were achieved in 60 days, such as opening the closed down galleries, modernising the display and lighting, launching outreach programmes to take the Museum to the community, arranging children's programme to ignite young minds to the greatness of India's national heritage, organising international exhibitions and launching the People's Museum movement, to mention a few. Pursuit of excellence was always central to Dr Bose's role in public administration. His contributions were seldom circumscribed by the call of duty. Instead, he has been engaged in continuous research and field experimentation in developing the most appropriate, people-first solutions. He also took key steps to synergise the various government programmes and schemes to create comprehensive, sustainable and inclusive administrative mechanisms that have since been replicated in multiple domains. In recognition of this remarkable turnaround of the Museum and the perceptible makeover of the institution, Government of India asked Dr Bose to continue with this mission even after his retirement from service.

Evaluation report shows that Nirmithi Kendras led to millions of people getting affordable houses, employment generation, particularly for women.. District Tourism Promotion Councils are doing sustainable work in promoting tourism and the model is taken up at national level.  Contributions to the society  Bose's contributions to the society over more than four decades of his career have been documented evaluated and complimented by government and independent agencies. Summing up Bose's contributions former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has written. Bose has been a pioneer in low cost housing and his innovations in the field have been recognized by the Government of India. His penchant for innovation was markedly manifest in his efforts at market intervention during the price hike of essential commodities, when he was heading NAFED. In the fast progressing Indian society, any investment in good governance will add to the well being of the people and those who pioneer inspiring innovations to facilitate easy delivery of public service deserve appreciation and encouragement. Government of Kerala has said in the official citation . Bose is described as a Lord of Ideas. The innovative initiatives taken by Dr. Ananda Bose in the field of rural development, eco friendly tourism, womens empowerment, uplift of the weaker sections, art and culture have played a major role in the onward progress of Kerala as well as the nation. Nirmithi Kendra initiated by him has been a blessing to the society.  References  * ‚Äì Asianet News Part 1 * ‚Äì Asianet News Part 2 * ‚Äì C.V.

It was published in book form in 1907. The stories included are as follows: \\"Helena‚Äôs Path\\" Ambrose Calverley, who has travelled and adventured for many years, returns to England on the death of his father. Inheriting the title and estates of Lord Lynborough, he takes up residence at Scarsmore Castle on the coast of Yorkshire, with his friends Leonard 'Cromlech' Stubb, an ancient history researcher, and Roger Wibraham, his private secretary. Fond of sea bathing, he finds that the path to the beach, the 'Beach Path', which passes through the grounds of Nab Grange (formerly part of the Calverley estate), has been blocked off by the new owner, the widowed Anglo-Italian lady Helena, Marchesa di San Servolo. Although neither meet, a dispute begins between them concerning access to the path. Neither will give way, the lady is prepared to go to court and Lynborough calls her bluff. After a stalemate, Lynborough persuades his friends to pay court to the ladies staying with the Marchesa. Seeing her chance, she applies a similar strategy to Lynborough's companions, creating a wedge in his resolve. Persuaded by her lawyer that her legal case is very weak, the lady accepts a compromise presented to her by an 'embassy' sent by Lynborough. He demands the right to use the path, if she will allow him to visit her to present his 'homage' once a year on the day of St John Baptist. She graciously accepts. It is implied that they will eventually marry. And the Beach Path is renamed 'Helena's Path'. \\"Mrs Thistleton‚Äôs Princess\\" The story is narrated by Tregaskis, a country gentleman, who is invited to the manor of Mr and Mrs Thistleton to meet the exiled Princess Vera of Boravia. Mr Thistleton, a lawyer, is negotiating for the return of the Princess's private fortune, but is unsuccessful. To pay off his fee, the impoverished princess is forced to accept the position of governess in the household, known simply as Fr√§ulein Friedenburg. When a neighbour, an up-and-coming stockbroker, becomes engaged to the eldest daughter of the house, instead of the princess (as she had hoped), she is forced to leave. A respectable situation is found for her, but as she leaves, a revolution breaks out in her country. She travels to Vienna, with expenses paid by Tregaskis, who is the only one who actually believed her story. It transpires later that she has indeed become Queen of Boravia. \\"The Necessary Resources\\" Prince Julian, pretender to the throne of a European country, is living in London with the mysterious Mrs Rivers. Byers, a financial speculator, is persuaded by her to provide support to the prince, but in fact contrives rumours that will cause the country's stock to rise and fall in value. In the end, the prince does not return to his country, but he does marry Mrs. Rivers. Byers makes a fortune and later stands for Parliament. \\"Miss Gladwin‚Äôs Chance\\" Mr Foulkes, a solicitor, narrates the tale of Sir Thomas Gladwin of Worldstone Park, a rich country gentleman. A widower, he is engaged to Nettie Tyler, a girl many times younger than he is, and he has altered his Will in her favour. Four days before the wedding, he is killed in a horse riding accident. The Will has not been formalised and the estate goes to his daughter Beatrice, who had largely been cut out of her inheritance. She allows Nettie to remain on the estate with the uncertain status of 'companion'. A year later, Beatrice accedes to the unspoken feelings of the local 'county set' and makes over ¬£100,000 in her favour. Shortly after, Nettie becomes engaged to neighbouring impoverished landowner Captain Spencer Fullard who had once paid court to Beatrice. She reveals to Foulkes that she did it to stop Fullard proposing marriage to herself. \\"The Prince Consort\\" The narrator tells of the Clinton family. Mrs Clinton is a well-known novelist and a centre of literary society, whilst her husband is content to live in her shadow. He has let it be known that he also 'writes', but nothing much is known of what he writes. Eventually, a large two-volume work emerges and is taken up by his wife's publishers more as a favour than anything else. The work is an unexpected success and the gaze of the literary set turns from Mrs Clinton to her Husband. \\"What was expected of Miss Constantine\\" Katherine Constantine is rich, pretty and the object of interest to two men; Valentine Hare of the Colonial Office, and Oliver Kirby, also in the government. She is proposed to by Hare, but she keeps him waiting for an answer. Family and friends all volunteer opinions and advice. She discusses the matter with a friend, Mr Wynne. When Hare is elevated to the Secretaryship for the Colonies, Miss Constantine decides to marry Kirby. They immediately leave for Canada, where Kirby hopes to enter politics. \\"Slim-Fingered Jim\\" Gentleman thief James Walsh, known as Slim-Fingered Jim, has been convicted for involvement in a bond robbery and sentenced to seven years in prison. In a country house garden one evening, Mrs Pryce confides to a friend that she met Walsh several years previously on a ship travelling from America. She was much taken with his suave and debonair manner, even after he confessed to her his involvement in a swindle. He was later arrested but found not guilty. She hopes that he can tolerate his prison sentence. \\"The Grey Frock\\" The Petheram family are landed gentry, but as a large family, their expenditure exceeds their income. One daughter has already married into the aristocracy, but Winifred chooses to become engaged to Harold Jackson, who has a small income only. Harold takes Winifred to London to see the house he proposes to rent for them. It is the best they can afford, but Winifred is horrified at the small size and dirtiness of the proposed home. She is even more horrified that Harold has ignored the new grey costume she has specially worn for the occasion. She breaks the engagement, and it is implied that she may marry a wealthy former suitor instead. \\"Foreordained\\" One evening in a London club, The Colonel relates a story of a friend, George Langhorn, who inherited the ownership of Stretchleys, a high-class Savile Row tailor, but hates it. He is persuaded to take a break in Monte Carlo, where he meets the pretty and rich Miss Minnie Welford. It transpires that she has inherited half-ownership of a mass- production clothing company Sky-High Tailoring, which she also hates. The couple quickly become engaged and marry. One of the Colonel's listeners, a lawyer, then reveals that the week before, the companies amalgamated, with Langhorn as Chairman of the joint concern. \\"Prudence and the Bishop\\" Miss Prudence, eldest daughter of a vicar with a large family, is expected to marry money. She discusses with a friend the chances of her husband-to-be becoming a bishop. \\"The Opened Door\\" A passenger on a sinking ship debates with himself whether or not to surrender to his fate. A scoundrel of some sort who has escaped trial and prison, he eventually drowns. \\"Love‚Äôs Logic\\" In a short dramatic scene, a man who has just avoided proposing marriage, and a lady who has just refused a proposal, meet and discuss their various failures. \\"La Mort √Ä La Mode\\" Monsieur Le Duc and Madame La Marquise are being taken to their execution during the French Revolution. They exchange words and comfort each other before they mount the scaffold. \\"The Riddle of Countess Runa\\" The walled city of Or is being besieged by King Stanislas, but the ruler of the city, Countess Runa, has held out and defied the King's angry demands. She claims that the city cannot be defeated until a riddle she has presented to him is solved. A prisoner is brought to her, who claims to be a renegade from the King's army. He is given sanctuary for seven days and nights and will be released if he has solved the riddle. On the final morning, he reveals himself to be the King, as Runa had known all along, and proposes a truce. And so peace reigns in the Kingdom. \\"The Lady and the Flagon\\" The rich young Duke of Belleville (pronounced Bevvle) visits his villa near Hampstead Heath, but late at night, he feels lonely and bored. He bribes a passing policeman to change clothes with him and goes on patrol to check the doors and windows of his neighbours. Returning, he sees a young man outside his villa. He claims that he is the Duke of Belleville (pronounced Bevvle) who has lost his key. Intrigued, the real Duke assists the imposter to enter. It's soon clear that he knows about, and plans to steal, the valuable 'Queen Bess Flagon'. A young lady, clearly an accomplice, arrives in a brougham. The real Duke changes clothes back with the policeman, snatches the flagon and runs across the heath, chased by the imposter. The chasers are confronted by a real policeman, an inspector who lives nearby; he recognises the fake Duke of Belleville (pronounced Bevvle) as a confidence trickster and arrests him. The real Duke, heartily enlivened by the night's excitement, refuses to prefer charges and the would-be thief is allowed to go free. He graciously presents the flagon to the (still anonymous) lady and she also leaves. \\"The Duke‚Äôs Allotment\\" The Duke, again bored with life, decides to take a small cottage and allotment in a country district and pass himself off as an out-of-work labourer. Unused to physical work, he is soon exhausted from his digging, and is visited by a formidable lady who believes him to be a drunkard. Affecting a Somersetshire accent, the Duke enjoys the deception. The lady sends her daughter to try to reform him. The house is later surrounded by other neighbours and police who have mistaken him for a thief believed to have burgled silver plate from a nearby manor house. The Duke takes to his heels, pursued by the local Chief Constable and others, but evades them. He returns home, accompanied by the lady, and resumes his true identity, much to her amusement.

Kodari is at the end of Arniko Highway which connects Kodari with Kathmandu which is 144 KM away from Kodari. It is a border crossing from Nepal into the Tibet Autonomous Region. Kodari is a part of Tatopani, which was a Village development committee (from 1990-2017). Kodari is now part of Bhotekoshi rural municipality in Sindhupalchok District of Bagmati Pradesh. The other side is the town Zhangmu, Dram or Khasa, situated in Nyalam County, Shigatse Prefecture of the Tibet. History In ancient times, it was the starting point of a trans-Himalayan caravan route. Newar traders headed north from Kodari and after crossing Kuti pass turned east to continue their journey across the Tibetan Plateau to Lhasa. The construction of the Kathmandu-Kodari Road during the 1963-67 period. It was named Araniko Highway in Nepal and China National Highway 318 beyond. As of 2011, Nepal is planning to expand it to six metalled lanes. China started building a railway in 2008 connecting Lhasa with Zhangmu on the Nepal-China border. It is an extension of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. In 2012, China signed agreement with Nepal to make this one of six ports of entries between Nepal and China. The April and May 2015 earthquakes essentially closed the route due to numerous landslides and boulders coming down, damaging roads in Nepal and Tibet (China). There was an evacuation and people have been slow to come back, and there is large reduction in trading. Chinese and Nepali officials met in December 2016 to discuss potential reopening of the port in 2017, which was blocked by progress of road construction. The checkpoint finally reopened on 29 May 2019. Following covid, this border closed until second week of June 2020, then closed again until further notice (likely thru 2021) due to the landslide since July 9, while also warning of lakeburst of Tso Lake. Rasuwagadhi checkpoint has been closed since Dec 2019, meaning no formal land border crossing between 2 nations. (No road access, only informal footpaths) Geography Kodari is located at an altitude of . Kodari is from Kathmandu. The height gain is from to . On a clear day, the Himalayan chain is visible on both sides of the road. From Zhangmu to Nyalam, a distance of the height gain is from to .  Transport  Kodari is just south of and above the Friendship Bridge border crossing where Araniko Highway becomes China National Highway 318 and immediately passes Zhangmu village in Nyalam County Shigatse Prefecture, Tibet Autonomous Region en route to Shigatse. Before the earthquake, tourists traveling between Nepal and the Tibet make substantial use of this crossing, and there was also substantial trans-border trade. Chinese trucks traveling on the Tibet-Nepal Friendship Highway offload goods at Zhangmu and transfer them to Nepalese trucks. Even though the drive between Kodari and Kathmandu is only half an hour, the sourcing logistics and bureaucracy of cross-border trade takes around 2 weeks, as such in 2013 it takes each Nepalese truck almost half a month for a round trip.

The congregation was founded in 1866 and the church building, designed by Henry Langley, was completed the following year. When the congregation relocated in 1888, it was sold to the Anglican Church and eventually demolished in the mid-1950s. History Alexander Street Baptist Church was founded in by about 20 members from Bond Street Baptist Church. Alexander Street was the first congregation of what was to be many Baptist congregations formed in the next 40‚Äì50 years within Toronto from the original Bond Street congregation. The church building, designed in the Gothic Revival style by the architectural firm of Thomas Gundry and Henry Langley, was completed in 1867 and seated 480 people. The $10,500 cost of its construction was largely met by a donation from Thomas Laily who owned a wholesale clothing business in Toronto. Laily was also a major contributor to the church's running expenses over the years.Robertson (1904) pp. 437Cathcart (1881) pp. 667-668 George McNutt (1867) was the first pastor of Alexander Street Baptist Church. (Hoyes Lloyd the editor of the Canadian Baptist since 1863 had been the interim pastor in 1866 and was formerly from Port Hope, Ontario). Andrew Heber Munro became its second pastor in 1869 and remained in his post for seven years, leaving to take over the pastorship of the First Baptist Church in Montreal.Cathcart (1881) p. 823 Following Munro's departure, the church was without a pastor for year until the arrival of his successor, Joshua Denovan (1829-1901) in 1878 who served until 1893 after the congregation had relocated (he resigned briefly due to health from 1888-1892 and W. H. Cline served in the interim). According to John Ross Robertson writing in Landmarks of Toronto: > The coming of Mr. Denovan at once infused new life into the church, and it > reconstructed itself and entered upon a career of remarkable activity and, > in one sense, has done a work that no other church in this city has > accomplished.

A building was eventually opened for use in September 1889 at the north-west corner of Dovercourt road and Argyle street. An outreach was also begun at 148 Tecumseth Street south (west of Queen and Bathurst streets) (also called Memorial Baptist Church), which is today occupied by the Ukrainian Baptist Church congregation. In 1888 the Alexander Street congregation experienced growth and decided to relocate and build a new church at Jarvis and Wellesley Streets. The new church building opened in 1889 and was renamed Immanuel Baptist Church. The Alexander Street church building was sold to the Anglican Church in 1888. It was demolished in the mid-1950s when the south side of Alexander Street was razed to make way for the City Park apartment complex.

Petty is an American attorney, politician and the current mayor of Worcester, Massachusetts. Early life and education Raised in Worcester, Petty graduated from Holy Name Central Catholic High School. He attended Nichols College and earned a law degree from New England School of Law. Political career Petty was first elected to the Worcester City Council in 1997. After serving six two-year terms on the council, he mounted a campaign for mayor in 2011 when incumbent Joseph C. O'Brien decided not to seek reelection due to family concerns. He defeated former mayor Konstantina Lukes, perennial candidate Bill Coleman, and Carmen Carmona by earning 48% of votes cast. During the preceding campaign, Petty received the endorsement of Congressman Jim McGovern. As mayor, Petty has overseen the partial demolition and redevelopment of Worcester Common Outlets, an abandoned downtown mall. This effort involves recreating a direct roadway between Union Station and Worcester City Hall and Common that was lost when the mall was built in the 1960s. In May 2012, Petty brokered a tax reform compromise among city councilors. Some councilors favored a sharp decrease in the city's commercial tax rate, while others wished to maintain the lowest possible residential tax rate. Petty proposed a comprise that decreased the commercial tax rate by $5.57 and raised the residential tax rate ¬¢92 per $1000 of assessed value. This tax reform, which passed on a 6-5 vote, was the subject of controversy, for it came in the wake of a revelation that annual property revaluations would lead to significantly higher commercial tax bills. While the city's assessors contended that the increased tax bills were due to reforms, such as considering a building's exact vacancy rate when calculating its assessment, other figures accused past administrations of improperly overriding assessments to provide lower tax bills. He was reelected to a second term in 2013. He was reelected to a third term in 2015. In early 2017, Petty apologized after he was caught on tape making disparaging remarks about people protesting a city council proposal. Earlier in the evening, he had thanked the protestors, saying they made Worcester proud. He was reelected to a fourth term in 2017. In 2019, Petty was reelected to a fifth term. This made him the first-ever mayor in the history of Worcester to receive a fifth two-year term as mayor. Personal life Petty is married to his wife Gayle Perrone and they have three children.

K. Jemisin and published by Orbit Books. The trilogy consists of The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms that won the Locus Award for Best First Novel and was nominated for the World Fantasy Award; followed by The Broken Kingdoms and The Kingdom of Gods. Characters Yeine Yeine is half-Arameri and half- Darr. She is small with curly hair, and can sometimes be taken for a boy. She's the chieftain, or ennu, of the Darre, which is a matriarchal society of warriors (reminiscent of the Amazons), until she is made a potential heir to the Arameri throne and put in charge of three other countries, all of which are bigger than Darre. Because of her bluntness and Darre manners, she is called a barbarian by the Arameri. Yeine is a resilient, independent woman. She's learned to mask her emotions from the Darre people, but cannot fake friendliness and affection for those she does not like. She loathes the Arameri family, but will use Arameri tactics to protect those she loves. She treats the Enefadeh with respect unlike most of her kinsmen. Because Enefa's soul is within her body, she can hear the goddess' voice and see visions. Even though everyone, including Nahadoth, expects Enefa's soul to overtake her own, her soul defeats Enefa's and she replaces the goddess with Enefa's blessing. N.K. Jemisin's character study names her as impulsive and irrational (she obsesses over her mother's murder even when she has other things to worry about), and not above hurting herself to get what she needs. Nahadoth Nahadoth is the Nightlord, otherwise known as the god of night, chaos, and change. He was the first of the gods to exist. When Itempas murdered Enefa, he led his children in revolt against him, and was forced into a mortal body as a punishment. By day, he is \\"Naha,\\" a tortured human. By night, however, he is free to become something close to what he once was. Nahadoth is shaped by the thoughts and expectations of those around him. He is the father of Sieh, and loves Enefa, Itempas and later Yeine. Bright Itempas The god of law, order, light, and rules, Bright Itempas came after Nahadoth and though at first they fought, they later became lovers. He kills Enefa and imprisons Nahadoth and his children, but offers the Nightlord a chance to be free and serve him every time a new Arameri ruler is chosen. He is worshipped as the Skyfather by the Arameri people, who imposed him on all the peoples they conquered and declared all who remembered Nahadoth and the others as heretics. Enefa The goddess of twilight, dawn, balance, life, and death, she came third of the Three. She was the one who created life. Sieh was her firstborn. From the beginning, Nahadoth delighted in her creations, but Itempas didn't because he disliked change. She loves both Nahadoth and Bright Itempas, and Sieh obviously longs for her to love him like a mother. She seemingly has no choice but to love her children, but is also feared by them. When she is murdered, Itempas keeps a part of her soul, trapped in the Stone, and the rest is gathered and placed into Yeine by the Enefadeh. Sieh The Trickster god, he is the firstborn of Nahadoth and Enefa. A perpetual child, with a child's cleverness and a child's cruelty, he has bright green eyes and a falsely innocent demeanor. Sieh has chosen the path of a child, and therefore despite his age he can't stop loving and longing for a mother. Yeine notices at one point that when he is intent on something, he doesn't blink. He possesses a room full of multi-colored orbs in Sky, the Arameri palace which are actually a sun and planets stolen from various other solar systems. Kurue The goddess of wisdom, she betrays the Enefadeh's plan to Itempas. She is described as very beautiful, with gold and silver wings, though she takes the form of a plump, old librarian when she first appears to Yeine. Yeine kills her after she replaces Enefa. Zhakkarn The goddess of war and battle, she is huge, and described as taller kneeling than Sieh standing. Like Kurue and Sieh, she is another of Nahadoth's children, and the one to mark Yeine so that she'll be free from Arameri control. Yeine earns her respect after she kills Kurue. Dekarta The ruler of the Arameri and Yeine's grandfather, he offered his wife to transfer the Stone to him, which killed her and alienated his daughter, Kinneth. Despite this he continues to love his daughter, and always hoped for her return. In N.K. Jemisin's character study, she reveals that Dekarta blames Yeine for taking Kinneth from him. Scimina One of the potential heirs and a cousin once-removed from Yeine, Scimina is a cruel, half-mad woman with no conscience whatsoever. She sets Nahadoth on Yeine the first time she meets her and threatens to destroy Darre if she isn't named as heir. She sits at Dekarta's right hand at the Council, and is described as ‚Äúa reedy Amn beauty of sable hair, patrician features, and regal grace.‚Äù Relad Scimina's younger twin brother and the other potential heir, Relad surrounds himself with his vices. He knows if he aligns with Yeine his sister will kill him. T'vril A half-blood like Yeine, he is the palace steward and a good man who takes care of the servants and cares for Yeine. He was part Amn and part Ken, and gets his red-colored hair from his Ken side. His Amn father was also Relad and Scimina's older brother. T'vril is said to be just as smart as Scimina or Relad. Yeine orders Dekarta to name him heir after she takes Enefa's place. Viraine The palace Scrivener‚Äîor scholar of the gods‚Äîhe claims to have been Kinneth's friend and offers to befriend Yeine. Yeine doesn't trust him, and later figures out that he was her mother's lover and that she used him to learn the truth about her mother's death. Geography Darre A matriarchal society, Darre is made of tribes and ruled by the ennu, which happens to be Yeine. Darre publicly rescinded their faith in Nahadoth and the Enefadeh when they were conquered by the Arameri, but still worship them in secret. The men in Darre are trophies, and used basically to sire children, though many couples, such as Kinneth and Yeine's father, are deeply in love. The Darre have a brutal coming-of-age ceremony, in which the young woman has to survive in the forest for a month, and then return home to fight publicly with a man her sponsor has chosen. She will either win and control the sex that follows, or be brutally raped. Usually, the sponsor chooses a weak man, but because the Darre people don't trust Yeine's Amn blood, her grandmother chooses the strongest warrior. Yeine fights as best she can, fulfills the ceremony, and then kills her rapist with a rock afterwards, effectively claiming her right to rule. The Darre people are said to have dark skin, straight hair, and lush curves. Sky The city of Sky is sprawled over a small mountain and completely white. The Palace, which is also called Sky and where the majority of the story takes place, was built by the gods and sits above the earth, floating in the sky. In Sky (the city), there is the Salon, a white-walled building where the Consortium (world council) meets to pretend that they aren't all just obeying the Arameri. Amn The most populous and powerful race, ruled by the Arameri, who indirectly rule the Senmite races by \\"advising\\" the Nobles Consortium, (world council), and the Order of Intempas (Intempas priests). Though they possess many armies and are a powerful nation in their own right, the reason the Amn people rose to power was largely due to the priestess, Shahar Arameri, who helped Intempas kill Enefa and whose offspring were therefore granted the Enefadeh as weapons. The Amn people are said to be tall with sable hair.  The Islands  To the east of Senm, a volcanic archipelago. Easternmost portions of the archipelago were close to the Maroland, and the people of those islands have a markedly different culture, darker skin, and curlier hair than those of the western islands. * Ken: Largest of the islands, at the western end of the chain. * Irt: Nation occupying half of a largish island. * Uthr: Nation occupying the other half of the Irtin island.  The Maroland  Lost continent, once to the southeast of High North. Smallest continent. Climate was subtropical-to-temperate. A place of great beauty and biodiversity; the first humans evolved here, then spread westward. The first Arameri home city was here, before the continent was destroyed by Nahadoth. For several centuries afterward the area where the Maroland had been was prone to underwater earthquakes/tsunami that made sea travel treacherous. Colloquially called ‚ÄúMaro‚Äù.  Races/Clansnkjemisin.com - The Inheritance Trilogy Non-Wiki: Races   Godly Races  = The Maelstrom = The origin of all things. The Maelstrom is the force, or entity, that gave birth to the Three. It has never communicated with any of its children, and not even the gods fully understand its nature. Yeine perceives it during her lovemaking with Nahadoth in The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms as ‚Äúa sound: a titanic, awful roar.‚Äù The gods describe it as a churning storm, not just of energy or matter but of concepts as well. Most godlings, demons, or mortals who approach too closely are torn apart by its raging power. = Gods = The creator entities of the Inheritance Trilogy. Gods are equally at home as corporeal or incorporeal beings, are able to travel virtually anywhere in creation, and have complete power over all material and metaphysical objects and concepts. Only three gods exist at the beginning of the trilogy: Nahadoth, Itempas, and Enefa. Enefa was murdered by Itempas, and eventually replaced by Yeine. Individually the gods are extremely powerful, but not omnipotent or omniscient. Only the Three acting in concert have absolute power, rivaled only by the Maelstrom. = Godlings = Godlings are immortal children of either the Three or other godlings, or some combination thereof. Each has an affinity and antithesis, and all possess the ability to travel anywhere and manipulate matter, including their own bodies. Beyond this, their powers vary widely per individual. Godlings exist in three rankings: niwwah, mnasat, and elontid. In The Kingdom of Gods, Sieh defines the demons as a fourth ranking, but notes that they are all (to his knowledge) dead.

Below are the relevant subgroups of humankind: * Darre - Primary ethnic group of the barony of Darr, on the High North continent. A small population of ethnic Mencheyev also inhabit Darr, and many Darre are at least partially descended from other ethnic groups conquered or captured during the nation's warrior past. Matriarchial/egalitarian, ruled by a council of respected elders with a young warrior as their figurehead (the ennu). Darre tend toward short stature and deep-chestedness. They have brown skin and long black or brown hair; many Darre also have epicanthic-fold eyes. Like most High Northers, they may be a distant offshoot of the Tema people. * Amn - Primary ethnic group of most nations on the Senm continent. Amn have white skin but varying hair and eye colors and morphology, legacy of their past as nomadic barbarians raiding and conquering other ethnic groups. Egalitarian, ruled by the Arameri family, the Nobles‚Äô Consortium, and the Order of Itempas. Amn once spoke many languages, but since the Gods‚Äô War they speak only Senmite. * Maroneh - Primary ethnic group of Nimaro,. Maroneh have black to dark brown skin and brown or black hair; their hair has a natural tight coil. There were once over 100 separate ethnicities in the Maroland, but the survivors of the Maroland's sinking have become a single group calling themselves Maro‚Äôn‚Äôneh, or ‚Äúthose who mourn Maro‚Äù. * Ken - Most populous of the island races, in the east. Known for their seafaring and shipbuilding. Generally pale-skinned and tall, with brown or red hair. Their language is Kenti. Offshoot races of the Ken include the Irtin and the Uthre. * Min - An island race. Known for their seacraft and piracy. * Teman - The people of the Teman Protectorate, a collection of several smaller nations which act as a union. They are ruled by the Triadice. Temans are of moderate height, generally have black or brown hair, and have brown skin of varying shades. Most Temans wear their hair in ‚Äúcable locks‚Äù ‚Äî long locks of hair which have been bound together until the hair fibers fuse. Wealthy Temans decorate their hair with jewels and wire made of precious metal; poorer Temans use found objects (e.g., seashells). Tema's capitol, Antema, is the oldest city in the world, and the only city to survive the Gods‚Äô War intact. * Tokken - A High North race. Fierce warriors, patriarchial. * Uthre - The people of the island kingdom of Uthr. Conquered the neighboring land of Irt in a bloodless conquest that was later approved by the Nobles‚Äô Consortium. The Uthre resemble the Ken. * Narshes - A High North race. Their nation was conquered centuries ago; they exist as a minority in several High Northern countries. * Irti - The people of the island kingdom of Irt. Irt was annexed by the neighboring land of Uthr in a bloodless conquest that was later approved by the Nobles‚Äô Consortium. The Irti resemble the Ken.  The Demon Race  Demons, in the world of the Hundred Thousand Kingdoms, are the offspring of a mating between gods and humans. They are mortal, like humans, and for the most part resemble humans, though there are some cases of demons bearing visible ‚Äúdeformities‚Äù as a marker of their inhuman heritage. (An example is Oree Shoth's eyes, which are specialized to see magic but incapable of seeing anything else.) Since nearly all mortal humans have gods somewhere in their lineage, the designation of ‚Äúdemon‚Äù refers to degree of godly heritage ‚Äî generally only those who are 1/8th god or greater. Some mortals with more distant godly heritage are also deemed demons if they are throwbacks in some way. They must possess the three traits which mark a demon: # Abnormally powerful (for a mortal) magical abilities # Unusually long lifespan (averaging 200 years) # ‚ÄúToxic blood‚Äù; the blood of demons is a deadly poison to gods if ingested or otherwise inserted into the god's corporeal body. The discovery of this last trait, the demons‚Äô deadly blood, caused their downfall as the gods then turned on them and hunted them to near extinction. Only a few demon lineages now survive, in secret and sometimes unknown even to themselves. The only known demons at the time of the Inheritance Trilogy include Oree Shoth, her father (deceased), her daughter Glee Shoth, Itempan priest and scrivener Dateh Lorillalia, Shahar Arameri the younger, Dekarta Arameri the younger, and Remath Arameri. Sieh and Itempas also remember Shinda Arameri, Itempas‚Äô first demon child (deceased). Little is known of the age before the Demon War ‚Äî that period in which they lived and walked freely among the realms. There were possibly thousands of them at the height of this age. In many cultures demons were hailed as mortal gods due to their great magical abilities. They were generally regarded as more approachable than ‚Äúpure‚Äù gods. In The Broken Kingdoms Appendix 2, Nemue Sarfith Enulai speaks of Yiho of the Shoth Clan ‚Äî a daughter of Enefa, and likely an ancestor of Oree Shoth ‚Äî who created salmonlike river fish to feed her countrymen during a famine. As a result of this and other boons provided by the demons, many mortals helped to hide their local demons when the gods turned on them. In the Maroland, demons became a special class of bodyguard-historians called enulai, who helped to guard and guide the royal family of the various Maro peoples until the Maroland's destruction. Most demons were the descendants of Nahadoth via hundreds of mortal men and women, though godlings parented many as well. The goddess Enefa bore comparatively few demon children, as carrying these children made her unwell (a warning of their deadly blood). The god Itempas is known to have fathered only two demons: Shinda Arameri, son of Shahar Arameri; and Glee Shoth, daughter of Oree Shoth.

Built in 1883, it was the original home of the Michigan Mining School. The building is listed as a Michigan State Historic Site and is a contributing property of the Shelden Avenue Historic District. History The Continental Fire Company organized in 1860 in Houghton. The department's first fire hall was built in 1861 along the waterfront near the site of the modern-day Portage Lake Lift Bridge. The fire hall circa 1900 The new fire hall was built in 1883 and its bell was cast in 1884 by Centennial Bell Foundry, G. Campbell & Sons, Milwaukee Wis. The Continental Fire Company occupied the basement, which housed horses, and the main floor, which stored fire engines. Village offices were on the second floor. The Michigan Mining School, now Michigan Technological University, held its first classes on the second floor and in the basement from 1886 through May 1889. In the early 1900s, the building was extended to the north to store more oats and hay for the horses. In 1916, an addition was built on the western side to store two more fire engines. The city moved its offices out of the fire hall in the 1930s. On August 5, 1966, a bronze plaque was unveiled commemorating the building as the original home of the university. In 1974, the fire department moved to a new, more centrally located fire hall along Sharon Avenue in order to accommodate larger modern equipment. The fire bell was removed in October 1975 and transferred to the new location. The western addition was sold and became an auto supply store. The fire hall was listed as a Michigan State Historic Site on August 6, 1976. In 1978, the university purchased the building from the city to use as storage. On December 30, 1987, the Shelden Avenue Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, with the fire hall as a contributing property. It was sold in 2010 to a private group who renovated it into an entertainment venue, called the Continental Fire Co., which opened in February 2012. The western addition became vacant in October 2011 when the auto supply store moved to a new location. Architecture The fire bell at the current fire station The fire hall is a flat-roofed, three-storyTwo stories plus the basement level brick structure designed in the Italianate style. The foundation is built of rubble and painted white. A small, four-faced clock tower was originally situated on the cupola at the front of the building. The vertical space provided room for fire hoses to hang and dry.

McLure was born in Zelienople, Pennsylvania. His father Andrew, a carpenter, moved the family to Wheeling in what was then the state of Virginia in 1816. In 1832 an eventful trip on a river steamer convinced the young McLure that he wanted to be a steamship engineer. After some time spent working on building ships and engines in Wheeling and in Pittsburgh, he obtained a position as engineer on a steamboat, and worked as a first or second engineer until about 1843, when he advanced to captain on the Amazon, a Wheeling-built boat which he had an ownership interest in. He also obtained a pilot's licence, and worked as both captain and pilot. Over the next few years McClure and partners built a series of steamboats which he captained for a time and then sold. McClure worked as a builder, captain, and owner until 1858, when he retired from building boats and captained his own steamboat, the Eunice, until the outbreak of the Civil War. McLure was nominated as an at-large presidential elector for Abraham Lincoln on the Virginia Republican ticket in 1860.Virginia Memory website with image of 1860 Republican ballot ticket He also attended the First Wheeling Convention in May 1861.List of Delegates on WVCulture.org site In 1861 the Eunice and McLure entered the service of the Union, ferrying troops up the Kanawha River. In September 1861 he was made commodore of the Kanawha River steamers. In 1862 he commanded a group of three light steamboats which moved to Tennessee and were converted into gunboats for convoy duty on the Cumberland River. In 1863 he performed the same duty on the Tennessee River in support of Union activity there. McClure then resigned and returned to running steamboats on the Ohio until several years after the war's end.Prominent Men of West Virginia, George W. Atkinson and Alvaro F. Gibbons, published by W.

In 1873 Captain McLure took over the ownership of the McLure House from his uncle, who died in 1874 at the age of 91. In 1875 McLure served as the chairman of a civic committee arranging the removal of the state capital to Wheeling; he captained the steamship Emma Graham which picked up the governor and state officials and took them to Wheeling in the midst of a controversy over the move.Removal of the State Capital, West Virginia Archives website Family life McLure married Elizabeth Campbell in 1841; they had eight children: Thomas, Harry, McBurnie, John Jr., Pintie, Juliet, and Betty.

The machine began work in January, 1967 for Hanna Coal, and was later purchased by Consolidated Coal in \\"Little Egypt Valley\\" near Barnesville, Ohio. The area was also where the GEM got its name. The GEM of Egypt was one of three in the service of the Hanna Coal Company, which by 1970, had been strip mining in Ohio for decades. The other two power shovels were The Tiger and The Mountaineer. Of the three, the GEM of Egypt was the largest of the power shovels in the Hanna Coal Company, of which it went into service via the official opening of the Egypt Valley mine in January 1967. It was reported that an estimated 25,000 people traveled to the site, many from Ohio cities such as Cleveland, Akron, and Canton, as well as those from neighboring states. The Gem of Egypt was 20 stories tall and weighed 7,000 tons. Production there was expected to average 20,000 tons a day, which the company forecast would last for the next 30 to 40 years until the vein ran out.

Background Jeffrey Williams was born in Seattle, Washington. He was born to Jeffrey Williams and Beverly Minnis Williams and grew up in a blended family of 12 children. He is openly gay. His gift for fashion and design was evident as young as age three, he loved the feel of fabrics, liked picking out his mother's dress up clothing. His mother supported and inspired her prodigious son, supplying him as young as seven, with needles, thread, and fabric his first designs were pillows. By high school he had a fully equipped design studio in his home and a Jeffrey Williams prom gown was desired by his classmates. His gift for design and style was applied to making handmade wigs for his mother during her bout with breast cancer. Being raised in a large family that was eventually headed by one parent, he knew that the cost of pursuing fashion design would be a hard task to accomplish but after graduating from Garfield High School in 2002, he applied and was accepted in 2004 into the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. That same year his mother succumbed to breast cancer. She continues to be an inspiration. His mother left his godmother, Dawn Mason (Former WA State Representative) with instructions that she must see that Jeffrey complete design school, and that one day he would be famous. Education His talent as an illustrator was recognized by his instructors, and was selected for the highly competitive Illustration program. Then following a desire to add an international appeal to his design he competed for a coveted spot in the study abroad option. Offered by the New York Fashion Institute, he studied abroad at Politecnico di Milano in Milan, Italy, and developed a love for working as a fashion designer, internationally. Participating in many art programs to gain notoriety. In 2009, Williams graduated from the New York Fashion Institute getting a Bachelors in International Fashion Design. Soon after graduating, he began to collaborate with many other fashion designers in order to better his own individual clothing line. The designers Williams has worked with include Alexander Wang and Peter Som. He has also worked with many celebrity stylists such as Patti Wilson. Career By the request of his older sister, Baionne, Williams decided to audition for the second season of the reality television program The Fashion Show. While on the show, he received mixed reactions from the judges. As the show progressed and his fashion designs work began to improve, and he became popular with the viewing audience he became very competitive. He won as The Ultimate Designer, beating eleven other contestants. On the series finale, he was highly praised by the show's judges Iman, and Mary J. Blige, who described this work as unique and of high value. Since the ending of the show, he has gained confidence to venture into other projects and ideas. He traveled to India to view fabrics and designs and is now working as a fashion illustrator, a fashion consultant, and a stylist. Residing in New York, he works on his own fashion line.

Westfall (born June 10, 1950) is an American experimental nuclear and high energy physicist and University Distinguished Professor at Michigan State University. He is also an author of the introductory calculus-based physics textbook University Physics, published by McGraw-Hill in 2010. Nuclear Physics Career Gary D. Westfall started his career at the Center for Nuclear Studies at the University of Texas at Austin, where he completed his Ph.D. in experimental nuclear physics in 1975. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory After his Ph.D. Westfall went to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in Berkeley, California, to conduct his post-doctoral work in high-energy nuclear physics and in 1977 stayed on as a staff scientist. While he was at LBNL, Westfall became internationally known for his work on the nuclear fireball model and the use of fragmentation to produce nuclei far from stability. National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory In 1981, Westfall joined the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University (MSU) as a research professor; there he conceived, constructed, and ran the MSU 4œÄ Detector. His research using the 4œÄ Detector produced information concerning the response of nuclear matter as it is compressed in a supernova collapse. In 1987, Westfall joined the Department of Physics and Astronomy at MSU as an associate professor, while continuing to carry out his research at NSCL. Since 1991 he has been serving as co-principal investigator on the NSCL cover grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation, which supports the operation of the NSCL. He was promoted to full professor in 1991, and in 2003 he was named university distinguished professor. STAR Collaboration In 1994, Westfall joined the STAR collaboration, which is carrying out experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, New York. He is Michigan State University's STAR Council representative, and since 2009 he has been serving as chair of the STAR Council. He was chair of the RHIC User Executive Committee from 2003 to 2005. At American Physical Society meeting in Tampa, Florida, in April 2005 he represented the entire RHIC community in announcing the discovery of the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (termed \\"perfect liquid\\" because of its vanishingly small viscosity). LON-CAPA and Textbook Westfall has taught university physics and astronomy classes on the undergraduate and graduate level since 1987. He is particularly interested in the introductory physics curriculum for engineering and science majors. For decades he has collaborated closely with his MSU colleagues Wolfgang Bauer and Walter Benenson. They obtained NSF funding to develop novel teaching and laboratory techniques, authored multimedia physics CDs for their students at MSU's Lyman Briggs College, and co-authored a textbook on CD-ROM, called cliXX Physik. In 1992, they became early adopters of the Internet for teaching and learning by developing the first version of their online homework system. In subsequent years, they were instrumental in creating the LearningOnline Network with CAPA (LON-CAPA), which is now used at more than 70 universities and colleges in the United States and around the world. Since 2008, Bauer and Westfall have been part of a team of instructors, engineers, and physicists, who investigate the use of peer-assisted learning in the introductory physics curriculum. This project has received funding from the NSF STEM Talent Expansion Program, and its best practices have been incorporated into their textbook University Physics, which was published in 2010 by McGraw-Hill. Honors Westfall was awarded the Alexander-von-Humboldt Foundation Distinguished Senior U.S. Scientist Award (Humboldt Prize, Humboldt- Forschungspreis f√ºr Naturwissenschafler aus den USA) in 2007. In 2002 he received the Distinguished Faculty Award from Michigan State University. He was elected fellow of the American Physical Society in 1999.

It continues the story of Will Burrows in his struggle against the Styx, who have been a major and pernicious influence throughout mankind's history. Spiral was published in the United Kingdom by Chicken House on September 1, 2011, and publication in the US followed on May 1, 2012. Plot summary Part One: The Phase After the events of Closer, Colonel Bismarck, deprogrammed by an explosion during the attack on the Bank of England, decides to help defeat the Styx, and joins Will and Drake at Parry's estate. Drake introduces Will and Chester to three retired commandos living at Parry's estate: \\"Sparks\\" Sweeney, who was surgically altered to have enhanced senses and faster reaction times, Danforth, a genius who worked in defense electronics, and Jiggs, who is very good at hiding. Will also meets Parry's gardener, Old Wilkie, and his granddaughter Stephanie. The people of the estate watch for Styx presence, and eliminate the Dark Light conditioning with the help of a device known as the Purger, invented by Danforth. The Purger causes a Darklit person to repeat part of their programming, and Elliott, who is able to speak Styx, finds that Chester has been programmed to call the Styx and report their location. Bartleby and Colly, the Hunters, are engaged in a hunt near the estate, when they encounter two of the Styx soldiers called Limiters spying on the manor. The Limiters wound Colly, and kill Bartleby. Will and the group decide to leave when Mrs. Burrows detects Limiters entering the estate. They escape, only to be cornered by Eddie the Styx, who reveals that the Limiters, rogues like him, are under his control, he was the one Chester was reporting to, and that he saved Emily Rawls, Chester's mother, from being used as a terrorist by the Styx. After much hesitation and discussion he decides he must tell them of the Phase. Meanwhile, in the Colony, the Second Officer begins to worry, as the Styx are neglecting the Colonists to focus on their Topsoil plans. Many people have been moved to an unruly and violent shantytown in the North Cavern to make room for the New Germanian army, and people are disappearing. Topsoil, various terrorist attacks are made by Darklit people who have had bombs surgically implanted within them, and these \\"human bombs\\" kill foreign politicians to stir up hatred of Britain. At a factory bought by the Old Styx, the Rebecca Twins have brought several hundred humans and Darklit them to render them brain-dead, perfect hosts for the Phase. They have also brought the Styx's females, who are undergoing part of the Styx's life cycle called the Phase. The Styx are revealed to be an insect species with a unique trait: at infrequent intervals (hundreds or thousands of years apart), the Styx women grow a pair of insect limbs and a mosquito-like ovipositor, used to insert egg sacs into human hosts. From each egg sac, thirty Styx larvae hatch and eat the host from the inside, also absorbing the host's genetic code, explaining why the Styx so closely mimic humans. Styx females who haven't gone through puberty, such as the Rebecca Twins, only experience back pain and minor bleeding where the insect limbs would grow if they were old enough to join in the Phase. Eddie also reveals that in the event the Warrior Class was killed, the Armagi would be released. The Armagi are capable of adapting to all environments, with three legs on land, fins and gills for water, or wings for air. The most horrifying aspect is that they can regenerate their entire body from just a single cell, making them nearly impossible to kill. Upon learning this, Drake and them decide they must take action. They set up headquarters in a military base known as the Complex, bomb shelter for the UK High Command dating back to the Great War. As a newscast reveals, strong anger has arisen worldwide over the human bomb attacks originating from Britain, and the United States and other countries cut off their connections to Britain, which closes its borders and puts itself under martial law. Underground, the Styx abandon the Colony and seal the exits after evacuating the people of the shantytown to use as hosts for the Phase. Finally, Eddie is brought back to base where Elliott angrily attacks him. Part Two: Maelstrom Elliott is examined by Danforth to make sure that she isn't being affected by the Phase, as it is uncertain whether or not she can take part in it as a Styx/human hybrid. Danforth announces that she should be safe for now, although that may change when she finishes puberty. In the Colony, the First Officer decides to quit after someone tries to burn the Colony's police station down. (See Arson) His last act before promoting the Second Officer to head the Colony's police is to set the prisoners in the Hold free. Topsoil, Elliott and Stephanie bond as the group tries to think of ways to find the Phase. They decide to use Drake's computer program to find where people are being Darklit, but cannot think of a place high enough to survey the entire country until Sergeant Finch, the Complex's caretaker, suggests the BT Tower in London. Danforth creates mobile Dark Light detectors out of the Geiger counters lying around the Complex, which Parry distributes to the Old Guard, an organization of ex-commandos that he can call upon in a time of need. The group travels to London via a Chinook helicopter and a disused subway line meant to ferry High Command to the Complex if war broke out. At the Tower they direct the Old Guard searchers to where Dark Light activity is detected, which is everywhere as the Styx are trying to destabilize England to make way for their invasion by starting riots. When one of the Old Guard finds a factory in Slough guarded by Limiters, New Germanians, and Darklit Topsoil soldiers, Parry decides to have the Old Guard attack there. Part Three: Assault The Rebecca Twins' argument over Rebecca Two's crush on Captain Franz is interrupted by a phone call warning them about the impending attack. They leave the factory, taking with them two of the Styx women, Vane and Alex, a pair of twins who were role models to the Rebecca Twins as they grew up. The Old Guard's attack on the factory goes almost flawlessly, wiping out the Warrior Larvae and the Styx women. To guard against the Armagi, they use incendiaries to destroy the factory. Watching the explosion, Vane, Alex, and Rebecca Two are despondent, but, as the mysterious warning call turns out to have come from Danforth, he had told Rebecca One what to do to ensure the spread of the Warrior Class: Rebecca One and Vane will go into the inner world, while Rebecca Two and Alex will stay Topsoil to induce the older Styx girls who may be far enough along in puberty to join the Phase. When the group returns to the complex, they review the security camera footage from the factory, where they discover the Rebecca Twins' escape. Meanwhile, Chester notices that his mother isn't acting normal. When the group asks Danforth to trace the call that warned the Rebecca Twins, he tells them that he made the call. He became convinced that the Styx were more highly evolved than humans after he translated the Book of Proliferation, a Styx text about the Phase that Eddie gave the group. Embittered by the government exiling him to Parry's estate in exchange for all his hard work for them during the Cold War, he tells them that the Styx are making him the director of their research efforts in exchange for him giving Rebecca One the idea about the inner world. He tells them that Emily Rawls, whom he Darklit, will cover his escape with a suicide vest. As Danforth flees, Jeff Rawls, convinced that he can persuade his wife to stand down, approaches Emily Rawls. She responds by detonating herself, collapsing the only way out of the Complex. Elsewhere, Rebecca Two and her grandfather, the Old Styx, have taken over a health spa in Kent, and are using it to breed more Warrior Larvae and induce the older Styx girls. Meanwhile, in the Complex, the mood is dire: they, the only ones who know that the Phase is still going on, are cut off from the outside world and only have two weeks worth of air left. With their time almost up, Drake and Eddie formulate a desperate plan: use the explosives stored in the Complex to blast through the side of the mountain. While the group fetches the explosives, Parry reveals that the Complex is being used to store obsolete nuclear bombs. In the inner world, Rebecca One arrives to learn that the high levels of UV light in the inner world has greatly accelerated the Styx life cycle: Vane has implanted egg sacs in over 300 humans in one day, the Warrior Larvae are already hatching, and Vane has grown two additional ovipositors and pairs of insect limbs. Topsoil, the group's plan works, and they escape the Complex. Parry's reveal of the nuclear weapons has given Drake an idea: use two of the devices to seal the passageways to the inner world. Part Four: Nuclear Half of the group (Drake, Mrs. Burrows, Sweeney, Jiggs, Will, Elliott, Colonel Bismarck, and Colly) use a stolen British Gas van to gain access to the house formerly owned by the Burrows family before their disappearance, and, more importantly, the tunnel to the Colony beneath it. When the group reaches the Colony, they arrive just in time to help the new First Officer and the freed prisoners overthrow the Governors, Colonists appointed by the Styx to positions of power as the Styx's puppets. While in the Colony, Mrs. Burrows decides to stay in the Colony, as she is blind, as well as Colly, who is pregnant with Bartleby's kittens. Also, Drake reveals that he possesses a second weapon of mass destruction: a virus that kills all mammals, including humans and Styx, that he stole from the Laboratories before he destroyed them. In return, the Colonists provide them with transport to the Deeps, where the Pore leading to the inner world is located. At the Pore, the group steals a Coprolite digger from the Limiters, who were using the Coprolites as slaves to dig a tunnel to the inner world. The group then use the digger and some mini-rockets designed by Drake to travel to the inner world. After they have planted the nuclear weapons, the group is about to exit the inner world when they are ambushed by Rebecca One, Vane, and a patrol of Limiters, killing Colonel Bismarck. Jiggs evens the odds when he emerges from hiding and kills one of the Limiters before being wrestled into the void by another, distracting the Styx long enough for Sweeney to kill the other Limiters. Seeing victory turn to defeat, Rebecca One tries to kill her old nemesis, Will, but Drake wrestles her into the void before she can shoot Will. Sweeney takes Vane hostage as a guard against Styx reinforcements. As Rebecca One and Drake fight as they fall through the void, Drake, thinking he is dying, detonates the explosives, presumably killing both of them and sealing the inner world. The electromagnetic pulse from the blasts overloads the circuitry in Sweeney's head, killing him. As he falls, he crushes the test tube containing the virus, releasing it into the inner world. The virus kills all of the mammals, humans, and Styx in the inner world except Will and Elliott, who were vaccinated for it in the Complex. Topsoil, while the other half of the group searches unsuccessfully for the site of the Phase, Chester has fallen into a deep depression over the deaths of his parents. Epilogue Rebecca Two's mourning over her twin sister's death is interrupted as the Armagi begin to hatch.

Starring Glenda Farrell as Torchy Blane, a beautiful, fast-talking wisecracking female reporter, teaming up with her boyfriend detective Steve McBride, to solve the killing of an investor who just bought a popular local nightclub. The first of nine Torchy Blane films by Warner Bros, it was released on January 2, 1937. The film is followed by Fly-Away Baby (1937). Plot Torchy Blane (Glenda Farrell) a reporter for the Morning Herald interviews Tiny Torgenson (Joseph Crehan) on the train. He is purchasing the Million Club and various gambling and sporting enterprises from his friend Fitz Mularkey (Addison Richards). Fitz has decided to quit the business due to his upcoming marriage to Marcia Friel. When Torchy and Tiny arrives at the train station, as they leave Union Station, Tiny is shot and killed. His murder is witnessed by Torchy and she calls her newspaper with the story. Torchy goes with her boyfriend detective Steve McBride (Barton MacLane) who is in charge of investigating the murder case, to the Million Club and tells Fitz Mularkey about Tiny's murder. Fitz being very good friends with Tiny wants to catch the murderer himself before the police can, but Steve advises him to do otherwise. While Steve investigates, Torchy learns from the club's hat check girl Dixie (Jane Wyman) that the club singer Dolly Ireland (Wini Shaw) was in love with Fitz and that Fitz's right-hand man and bodyguard, Chuck Cannon, was angry about losing his job. Steve suspects the other bidders for the business for Tiny's murder, but Torchy suspects Chuck. She persuades Steve to look for Chuck, and while they are at Chuck's apartment, Fitz shows up and demands to know about the police investigation on the case. Steve later learns that Chuck and Dolly were seen at Union Station just before Tiny was killed. Meanwhile, Torchy has afternoon tea with Fitz's fianc√©e Marcia, who asks Torchy to convince Fitz to sell his business to anyone who wants to buy it. Chuck is later found dead in his hotel room. Steve immediately suspects Fitz, as the evidence points to him being the killer. Fitz is confronted by Steve, but escapes. Steve doesn't believe Fitz is the killer and is covering for someone else. When the forensics report reveals that Chuck's gun did not kill Tiny, Steve questions Marcia, who tells him that because Chuck had threatened her, she is afraid that Fitz killed him to protect her. Torchy becomes suspicious when Marcia and her brother Lewis Friel (Robert Paige) tell conflicting stories about their parents. Torchy, Steve, and Gahagan (Tom Kennedy) go to Marcia's apartment to find Fitz. Torchy exposes Marcia and Lewis as phonies (and not siblings): they are con artists out to steal Fitz's money. Lewis is revealed as the killer of both Tiny and Chuck. He killed Tiny because he would have been able to recognize Marcia as an imposter, and Chuck because he was close to exposing them. Lewis pulls a gun but is shot by Fitz, and Marcia is arrested. Later, Fitz decides to keep the business and realizes his future is with Dolly, and Steve proposes to Torchy. Cast Glenda Farrell and Barton MacLane in Smart Blonde (1937) * Glenda Farrell as Torchy Blane * Barton MacLane as Steve McBride * Wini Shaw as Dolly Ireland * Addison Richards as Fitz Mularkey * Robert Paige as Lewis Friel * Craig Reynolds as Tom Carney * Charlotte Wynters as Marcia Friel * Jane Wyman as Dixie * Joseph Crehan as Tiny Torgenson * Tom Kennedy as Gahagan * Frank Faylen as Ted Parks Production In 1936, Warner Bros. began to develop an adaptation of the MacBride and Kennedy stories by detective novelist Frederick Nebel. For the film version, Kennedy is changed to a woman named \\"Torchy\\" Blane and is now in love with MacBride's character. Director Frank MacDonald immediately knew who he wanted for the role of Torchy Blane. Glenda Farrell had already played newspaper reporters in earlier Warner Bros. films Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933) and Hi, Nellie! (1934); she was quickly cast in the title role, with Barton MacLane as Steve McBride. Farrell and MacLane would star in seven of the nine Torchy Blane movies. The film was based on Nebel's short story \\"No Hard Feelings\\" published in the Black Mask magazine. The story was later adapted again as the 1941 film A Shot in the Dark. The movie's working title during filming was No Hard Feelings. The music and lyrics for the song \\"Why Do I Have to Sing a Torch Song\\" was written by M. K. Jerome and Jack Scholl. Home media Warner Archive released a boxed set DVD collection featuring all nine Torchy Blane films on March 29, 2011. Reception Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times writes: \\"In Smart Blonde, in which Glenda Farrell imitates a reporter and Barton MacLane libels the homicide squad, we have a murder mystery solved by an endless succession of door-openings and shuttings, taxi-hailings, jumping in and out of automobiles, and riding up and down in elevators. Mr. Shaw's pet antipathies are present, too, as well as one shot of Miss Farrell swinging aboard a moving train. For all this activity the film is a static and listless little piece which never made us at all curious about the killer of Tiny Torgensen, night club operator, and Chuck Cannon, who had been Suspect No. 1 until he also died of lead poisoning. I seem to remember having seen the story in pictures before; strange that the same mistake should have been made again.\\" References External links * 1937 films 1937 mystery films American films American black-and-white films American detective films Films about journalists Films directed by Frank McDonald Warner Bros. films American mystery films ","title":"Smart Blonde"},{"id":"34294774","title":"Aseem Trivedi"},{"id":"34294833","text":"Kalloconus is a subgenus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.

(2009), Systematic Classification of Recent and Fossil Conoidean Gastropods, ConchBooks, Hankenheim, Germany, 295 pp. * Genus Conus sensu stricto Linnaeus, 1758 :: Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The basic shell shape is conical to elongated conical, has a deep anal notch on the shoulder, a smooth periostracum and a small operculum. The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo- Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods including cones. * Subgenus Kalloconus da Motta, 1991 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The shell is large and obconic with broad angulate shoulders slightly rounded on the edges. The protoconch is multispiral. The anal notch is moderately deep to deep in larger specimens, and shallower in smaller specimens. The shell is ornamented with spots and dashes in spiral rows, and cords are either absent, very small and numerous, or die out early on whorl tops. The periostracum is smooth and thin, and the operculum is moderate in size. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The anterior sections of the radular tooth is substantially longer than the posterior section, and the blade is relatively short being one third to one- half the length of the anterior section. A basal spur is present, the barb is short. The radular tooth has a major row of serrations flanked by rows of smaller serrations. ::Geographical distribution :::The species in this genus occur in the West African region to Europe. ::Feeding habits :::These cone snails are vermivorous, meaning that the cones prey on polychaete worms.

Prior to the founding of Sanyo, he played an influential role in the growth and development of Matsushita Electric Works, working closely alongside his brother-in-law and lifetime confidant, Konosuke Matsushita. Early life The son of a sailor from Awaji Island, Iue initially followed his father's footsteps as a sailor's apprentice. When a ship he was on exploded, with Toshio barely escaping with his life, he took a job at an electric plant run by Konosuke Matsushita, who was married to one of Toshio's sisters. During his tenure at the company, he became an expert salesman, convincing wary resalers of the quality of Matsushita's electric products, which were from Osaka, in an era where most electric goods in Japan were made in Tokyo. Career at Matsushita After serving in the Japanese military, Iue came back to Japan and became Konosuke's brother-in-law once again when he married Mumeno Matsushita. Iue then took the lead in building a wooden boat factory for Matsushita upon request of the Japanese military during World War II. Upon Japan's defeat in the war, the General Headquarters of Allied Forces requested a change in the management of Matsushita, with one of its senior executives required to step down. Iue decided to step down so that Matsushita could continue as the head of the company. Founding of Sanyo After his resignation from Matsushita, Iue was summoned to the office of the president of Sumitomo Bank after an ill-timed loan to acquire shares in Matsushita, which had become close to worthless after Japan's defeat. The bank president forgave Iue's debt, and knowing his prior talent working at Matsushita, offered him starting capital for a new business. Konosuke Matsushita would lend Iue an unused plant in Hyogo Prefecture, where he followed in his brother-in-law's footsteps by initially making bicycle lamps and captured 60% of the Japanese market. He named his firm Sanyo, meaning \\"three oceans\\" in Japanese, hoping that he would be able to sell his products across the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The growing demand for home appliances and washing machines would fuel Sanyo's growth through the 1950s. Later life Iue retired and handed the presidency of Sanyo to his brother in 1968. During his retirement, he worked to promote development of Awaji Island and died in 1969. After a series of unprofitable quarters, Sanyo's story would go full circle as it was acquired in 2009 by Panasonic Corporation, the firm where Iue originally worked at alongside his brother-in-law, Konosuke Matsushita.

Description The planehead filefish grows to a maximum length of but is more typically about long. The colour is cryptic, being a more or less mottled pale brown, olive or green on a light coloured background, sometimes with darker brown splotches and streaks. The fish is laterally compressed and deep bodied. The snout is elongated with a terminal mouth. The large yellow eye is set high on the head and above it is a prominent retractable spine. This is the anterior of the two spines associated with the long dorsal fin, which also has 29 to 35 soft rays. The anal fin has no spines and between 30 and 35 soft rays. The pectoral fins are small and the tail fin is large and fan-shaped, often with two darker coloured bands.Stephanolepis hispidus (Linnaeus, 1766) FishBase. Retrieved 2012-01-04.Stephanolepis hispidus, Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2012-01-04. Planehead filefish are sexually dimorphic. In mature males, the second soft ray of the dorsal fin becomes greatly elongated and the scales on either side of the caudal peduncle develop into a patch of bristles. The elongated ray reaches between 104 and 128 mm. Females do not develop secondary sexual characteristics. They tend to have greater body depth than males, but variation in this trait exists in both sexes and overlap in measurements are recorded. Distribution and habitat The planehead filefish is found in the Atlantic Ocean at depths of up to . Its range extends from Nova Scotia to Uruguay in the west and from the Canary Islands to Angola in the east. It is found near the seabed on reefs and over sandy and muddy sea floors. It is often found among Sargassum seaweed. Biology In the Canary Islands the growth and ageing of the planehead filefish have been studied. Spawning takes place in the summer and the age of the fish is established by using the fast and slow growth rings found in the anterior dorsal fin spine. The species has a lifespan of about three years and reaches half its final length by the end of its first year. Uses The planehead filefish can be used for human consumption. In the Canary Islands it is caught in fish traps and at one time was considered to be a by-catch, incidental to the capture of other, more desirable fish. However, since the 1980s, it has become a target species in its own right and by 2000, there were concerns about overfishing.

Many hotels were built in downtown Meridian in the early 1900s to provide lodging for passengers of the railroad, which was essential to the city's growth at the turn of the 20th century. Two of these historic hotels‚Äìthe Union Hotel, built in 1910, and the Lamar Hotel, built in 1927‚Äìhave been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Others, including the E.F. Young Hotel, owned and operated by an African- American entrepreneur, have been recognized as contributing properties to the Meridian Downtown Historic District. Today, most hotels in the city are located in post-World War II suburban developments. Urban activists are working to establish a downtown hotel to aid in revitalizing the city's core and support the theater. The Threefoot Building, a former office building, has been considered for renovation and adaptation as a hotel. Nineteenth century hotels The Grand Avenue Hotel, built in 1890, was damaged by a tornado on March 2, 1906. Even before the city was officially established in 1860, hotels had been built, on the strength of the proposed linking of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and the Vicksburg and Montgomery Railroad. After Sherman's raid of the city in 1864 during the American Civil War, only four buildings remained standing. One of those was the Jones House, used as a hotel, at the corner of the present-day 25th Avenue and 5th Street. Another hotel, the Ragsdale House, was built just after the war in 1865 near the train station. This three-story building provided a wooden-covered walkway for its customers leading directly over the dirt road to the train station, a luxury that other hotels did not have. Other major hotels built before Meridian's \\"Golden Age\\", from 1890 to 1930, include the Phoenix Hotel at 26th Avenue and 7th Street, built in the early 1870s and destroyed by fire in 1876; the St. Charles Hotel and St. Bernard Hotel, both built in 1881; and the International Hotel, built in 1884. The owner of the International Hotel was Felix Weidmann, who had founded Weidmann's Restaurant in 1870. In the early 21st century, Weidmann's is the oldest operating restaurant in the state of Mississippi. The Great Southern Hotel was built in 1890 at 6th Street and 23rd Avenue. Two more hotels were built in 1890: the Grand Avenue Hotel and the Great Southern Hotel. The Grand Avenue Hotel was located a block away from the train station and appealed to families accompanying students traveling to and from the Meridian Male College. The Grand Avenue was damaged, along with a large portion of downtown, by a tornado on March 2, 1906. Several photographs of the damage in the city were taken from the hotel's second floor balcony. The building was rebuilt, however, and survived into the late 20th century. It was listed as a contributing property to the Meridian Urban Center Historic District in 1979. The Great Southern Hotel‚Äìdescribed by Jack Shank, a local historian, as \\"the hotel\\"‚Äìwas five stories tall and contained 150 rooms. Costing $175,000 (today $) and taking up half a city block at 6th Street and 23rd Avenue, the building was the largest and most expensive in the city. A restaurant was located on the roof, and a number of social events were held in second-floor parlors. Luxuries standard in the hotel included ceiling fans and reading lamps in every room, ornate oak woodwork throughout the building, and a public stenographer to assist patrons. Union Station With the construction of Union Station in 1906, hotel development was stimulated. The Elmira Hotel, now located at 1804 Front Street, was built in 1905 just before Union Station was completed. In 1910 the Terminal Hotel was constructed across the street at 1902 Front Street. Both hotels provided rooms for travelers passing through Union Station. In 1997 Union Station was expanded and restored. Since then these two hotels have been rehabilitated, along with many other downtown buildings in the following years as development has been stimulated. Hotel Meridian Also seeking to profit from the construction of Union Station and expectation of increased passenger traffic, local businessman Louis H. Arky opened the five-story Hotel Meridian two blocks from the station in August 1907. The hotel attracted business from railroad workers and passengers, and it was home to a fine dining restaurant. The hotel operated until at least the 1930s, and later was converted into permanent residences. Hotel Meridian was listed as a contributing property to the Meridian Urban Center Historic District in 1979 and as a contributing property to the Meridian Downtown Historic District in 2007. The building sat vacant for decades. When the board of the proposed Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center (MAEC) purchased the property next door to be used as a downtown museum, the owners donated this property for MAEC use. After the purchase, the MAEC released a statement that \\"due to the quality of the buildings and the function of them [...] we feel it's best to tear the buildings down.\\" The building was demolished in late 2011. During the demolition, workers discovered several metal canisters full of crackers from the 1960s, evidence of a shelter dating from the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. The site was vacant for more than three years. MAEC announced in early 2015 that the organization had raised over $19 million in private donations toward the center, as well as $25 million in state government funding. Ground was broken for construction on October 3, 2015, and construction of the MAEC is scheduled to be completed in November 2017. Union Hotel Union Hotel in 2008 The Union Hotel was built in 1908 to serve travelers to the city. The four-story building is located two blocks from Union Station and offered rooms to frequent rail travelers for only $2 per night, even as late as the 1960s. The original owner was P.C. Steele, but a group of bond holders took over control of the building in 1926. The hotel was leased for two years to C.W. Tucker from 1932 to 1934, but because of the onset of the Great Depression, he was unable to keep the hotel afloat. A couple with the last name Williams took over the store in 1934 and operated a restaurant on the first floor, helping keep the business profitable. The Williamses left the property after World War II but re-acquired it in 1955; they operated the hotel until closing it on December 18, 1973. In 1979 the building was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places and also as a contributing property to the Meridian Depot Historic District. After being sold in 1981 by the Williams family, the hotel was later converted into downtown apartments. When the Depot Historic District was combined with the Urban Center Historic District as the Meridian Downtown Historic District in 2007, the hotel was listed as a contributing property to the latter. Further growth Boosted by the railroad industry and related manufacturing, the economy of Meridian was in its \\"Golden Age\\" at the turn of the century. The population was around 15,000 in 1898, but by 1906 it had almost doubled to 28,000. Between 1890 and 1930, Meridian was the largest city in Mississippi and a leading center in the South for manufacturing. In 1907, around forty trains per day stopped in the city, providing passenger and freight service to a wide variety of destinations. The various railroad companies provided more than 6,000 jobs to city residents. By 1920 the number of trains per day increased to as many as one hundred. Lamar Hotel Lamar Hotel in 2010 Sam and Joe Meyer, who had previously been successful in the grocery business, became determined to build a hotel to express the grandeur of the growing city. In 1927 they built the eleven-story (then considered a skyscraper) Lamar Hotel, on the corner of 5th Street and 21st Avenue. The hotel was named after Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II, a former U.S. Senator from Mississippi, cabinet member, and member of the Supreme Court. When completed, the hotel had two grand openings‚Äìone for local and state officials, and a second for the general public. The hotel was supposed to be \\"the hotel\\" in Meridian, and at the beginning of its commission, it attracted business away from Hotel Meridian and the Union Hotel. With the drastic decline in business due to the Great Depression, it never reached its predicted splendor. The hotel was generally used by wealthier citizens and official visitors to the city; the general public rarely stayed in its rooms. For a short time, exhibits from the Meridian Art League were held in the hotel. These exhibits were eventually moved to the Meridian Museum of Art. The hotel operated well into the 1950s, before being sold a number of times. By the later 20th century, rail passenger traffic was superseded by people traveling by automobile, and sometimes bypassing downtowns altogether when they stopped for the night. The building was eventually purchased by Lauderdale County in 1969 and converted for office use as the Raymond P. Davis County Annex Building. The Lamar Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 and as a Mississippi Landmark in 1988. As it was not within the boundaries of either of the two smaller historic districts in downtown Meridian, the building was not listed as a contributing property to a historic district on the National Register until the larger Meridian Downtown Historic District was defined and listed in 2007. In 2011 the Mississippi Department of Archives and History (MDAH) issued a grant to the city to assess the building for possible restoration, stating the building had \\"significant repair and restoration needs.\\" E. F. Young Hotel E. F. Young Hotel in 2010 As the city grew, African Americans developed a small business district slightly west of the city's core, around the intersection of 25th Avenue with 4th and 5th streets. Black travelers often visited this area when coming to the city, as they were prevented by racial segregation laws from using most other public facilities. Black-owned businesses included a hotel, two restaurants, and a movie theater. Many businesses were started in this area, including one owned by E. F. Young, Jr., a local barber and taxi driver. Young opened a hotel and barber shop in 1931, and he also began selling hair care products made especially for African Americans. Some products he made himself. Eventually Young's operations included a beauty shop, two barber shops, a shoe shine parlor, and a manufacturing shop for the personal products. While operating the barber shops out of the hotel, Young sold customers some hair care products he made in his own kitchen. Demand became so great that he opened a manufacturing company in 1933. The hotel also prospered, as it was one of the only hotels in the city to serve black travelers. The company did so well that by the end of World War II, Young's hair products were sold at locations around the state, including a pharmacy in Clarksdale and a barber shop in Cleveland. Later, he opened a second manufacturing site for his products in Chicago, a major destination in the 20th-century Great Migration for many African Americans from Mississippi. After Young died in 1950, his wife Velma took over the business. In 1969 their son Charles became president. In 1985, Charles Young moved the business offices from the Young Hotel to a new building. By then he had expanded markets for the manufactured products to Canada and the Caribbean islands. In 2007, the Young Hotel was listed as a contributing property to the Meridian Downtown Historic District. Development of historic assets and push for a new downtown hotel The Threefoot Building in 2009, awaiting renovation Starting in the 1960s, residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new subdivisions north of the city's core. After strip commercial interests began to move downtown, the city worked to preserve its architectural legacy. It researched documentation to support designation of historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve aspects of the city's history. The city established the Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission in 1979. The Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985 to capitalize on the city's unique assets and sense of place. Meridian Main Street organized several projects to revitalize downtown and worked with merchants on marketing and design. It was one of the parties supporting the reconstruction of Union Station in 1997 based on the original design of the 1906 train station, with a contemporary use as a multi-modal transportation center for the region. Other Main Street projects included the renovation of the Rosenbaum Building in 2001 and Weidmann's Restaurant in 2002. Meridian Main Street, along with The Riley Foundation, helped renovate the historic Grand Opera House in 2006, adapting it as the Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts. It is intended as a site of activities and events to enliven the city. Just before the Riley Center was completed, the city announced that it had bought the Threefoot Building from a private developer. The expectation was that a Jackson renovation firm would convert the former office building into a luxury hotel. Staff at the Riley Center reacted positively, saying a downtown hotel would be a \\"wonderful thing for the city of Meridian.\\" No Jackson renovator was found for the project. In 2009 the city entered into a partnership with Historic Renovation, Inc. (HRI) from New Orleans, which had completed a similar project in Jackson. Late that year the partnership was terminated by the newly elected mayor Cheri Barry. The city was required to pay HRI $1 million in reimbursement fees. In this same period, local hotel owner Abdul Lala proposed constructing a new hotel for the downtown. Lala, who owns six hotels in the city, originally proposed the idea in 2008, before the city had partnered with HRI. While the Threefoot Building project, even with the partnership of HRI, would cost taxpayers millions of dollars, Lala offered to build a hotel at his own cost. Believing that the downtown cannot support two hotels, if the city renovates the Threefoot, he will not proceed with his project. After the city terminated its partnership with HRI, it initiated an arrangement with Watkins Development to develop a plan to build a new hotel on the same block as the Threefoot. Plans released in June 2011 include renovating the Threefoot Building as a mixed-use commercial and residential development. Jason Goree, vice president of Watkins Development, has said, \\"The Riley Center needs a convention center hotel. (Downtown Meridian) needs a convention center hotel.\\" Former mayor John Robert Smith, Lauderdale County Tourism Director Suzy Johnson, and Lala's partner Dede Mogollon agree. In September 2015 a deal was approved by the Meridian City Council, which sold the Threefoot to a Buford, Georgia-based hotel management company named Ascent Hospitality Management. The building was purchased \\"as-is\\" for $10,000 cash, and Ascent agreed to begin construction within 12 months of the date of purchase on a \\"Courtyard by Marriott\\" hotel with 120 guest rooms. Construction is scheduled to take approximately 14 to 18 months, with the company committing to spending at least $14 million on the project. John Tampa, head of Ascent Hospitality Management, has set a goal for the opening of the renovated building to coincide with the opening of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center at the site of the old Hotel Meridian in November 2017.

The most appropriate analogy is that of an island, where the movement of fauna is restricted by the surrounding marine waters, therefore isolating the fauna from other terrestrial populations. Isolating mechanisms and features such as roads, urban infrastructure, large creek lines and ridges can act to prevent the dispersal and gene flow of the less mobile invertebrate species. Subterranean fauna, which include stygofauna and troglofauna, typically comprise short-range endemics. Representative examples Several animal groups studied in Australia consist largely of short-range endemics, including freshwater and terrestrial gastropods (snails and slugs), earthworms, velvet worms, mygalomorph spiders, schizomids, millipedes, phreatoicidean crustaceans, and freshwater crayfish. Categories of short-range endemism Currently, there is no accepted system to define the varying probabilities of a species to be an SRE. The uncertainty in categorising a specimen as SRE originates in a number of factors including: * Poor regional survey density (sometimes taxon-specific): A regional fauna is simply not known well enough to assess the distribution of species. This factor also considers that simply because a species has not been found regionally, does not mean it is really absent; this confirmation (‚Äònegative proof‚Äô) is almost impossible to obtain (‚Äúabsence of proof is not proof of absence‚Äù). * Lack of taxonomic resolution: many potential SRE taxa (based on preferences for typical SRE habitats, SRE status of closely related species, or morphological peculiarities such as troglomorphism) have never been taxonomically treated and identification to species level is very difficult or impossible as species-specific character systems have not been defined. Good taxonomic resolution does not necessarily require a published revision, but generally requires a taxonomist to be actively working on this group or a well-established, preferably publicly available, reference collection (i.e. museum collection). * Problems of identification: SRE surveys often recover life stages of potential SRE taxa that cannot be confidently identified based on morphological characters, even if revisions exist. These include, for example, juvenile or female millipedes, mygalomorph spiders and scorpions. Molecular techniques are increasingly being employed to overcome these identification problems. Life stages of species that cannot be identified at the species level, e.g. some females and juveniles, are assessed based on the knowledge of the higher taxon they belong to, i.e. family or genus. For example, all juvenile or female Antichiropus millipedes would be classified as 'confirmed SRE' as all but two of the 120+ known species in this genus are considered SREs. Although the different categories of 'SRE-likelihood' may help to set conservation priorities, SRE taxa of all categories should be assessed on their merit, in order to determine appropriate conservation measures that adhere to the Precautionary Principle within environmental impact assessments. That is, \\"where there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason to postpone measures to prevent environmental degradation.\\" See also *Endemism *Biological dispersal Notes Endemism Endemic fauna ","title":"Short-range endemic invertebrates"},{"id":"34295235","text":"The building stones of Wales are many and varied reflecting the diverse geology of the country. Some of the earliest known use of natural stone for building purposes was the sourcing of Ordovician dolerite in the Preseli Hills for the 'bluestone' lintels of Stonehenge. Other early use was in the construction of dolmens, burial cairns and stone circles in the late Stone Age and Bronze Age. The tradition of building in stone was continued into Iron Age with the establishment of such hill forts as those at Tre'r Ceiri in North Wales and Garn Goch in the south. The Welsh Stone Forum was established in 2003 to raise the profile of building stone in Wales. Lower Palaeozoic stone The Lower Palaeozoic (Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian) geological periods have each provided Wales with sources of building stone. The Cambrian Caerbwdi sandstones may be seen in St David's Cathedral whilst Ordovician slates from northern Pembrokeshire were once an important local roofing stone. The Cambrian and Ordovician slates of North Wales were once worked on a huge scale and the evidence of the former industry is considerable, especially around Llanberis, Bethesda and Blaenau Ffestiniog. Whilst most of this material was used for roofing, having excellent qualities in this respect, it was also used locally for building, for dry stone walls and slate fencing. Old Red Sandstone The Old Red Sandstone of the Anglo-Welsh Basin comprises a variety of Devonian age sandstones (alongside other rocks unsuitable for building purposes) of different colour and texture which have been widely employed for building locally. Such towns as Brecon, Hay-on-Wye and Abergavenny owe much of their character to the chestnut brown, or occasionally green hue of these rocks. Llanthony Priory and Tintern Abbey are two notable ecclesiastical buildings constructed from different varieties of this rock. It is also found favour with the builders of Goodrich and Raglan Castles for example. Carboniferous Limestone The Carboniferous Limestone has been used in castles at Chepstow, Pembroke and Carreg Cennen in South Wales and Penrhyn, Caernarfon, Beaumaris and Denbigh Castles in the north, amongst others. The 'Marble Church' at Bodelwyddan is built from locally sourced limestone (not marble). Pennant Sandstone The Pennant Sandstone is widespread around the South Wales Coalfield where it has been extensively worked to provide building stone for everything from field walls, though the terrace housing typical of places like the Rhondda to edifices such as Crawshay's Cyfarthfa Castle at Merthyr Tydfil. Both Swansea and Caerphilly Castles make use of 'Pennant Blue'. Basingwerk Abbey uses a northern equivalent of the Pennant, the Cefn Sandstone. Triassic sandstones Rocks of Triassic age are found in southern Monmouthshire and Glamorgan and some quarries have been worked here for building stone. The Quarella Stone from Bridgend has been used at Kidwelly Castle for example whilst a red conglomerate from Radyr quarries is to be found in service at Penarth docks. The Sudbrook stone, a sandy limestone, was used in the construction of Caldicot Castle in Monmouthshire and by the Romans when they constructed their forts at Caerleon and Caerwent. Jurassic limestone The limestone of the Lias Group occurs along the south coast of Glamorgan and it has been used in vernacular building locally.

Jockie began his musical career while a junior high school student in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan. After working with bands in Jakarta and Surabaya, in 1973, he joined with Ahmad Albar, Donny Fattah and Ludwig Leeman to form God Bless; he would remain with this band intermittently until the 2000s. Jockie also worked with artists such as Chrisye and Iwan Fals, ultimately writing two songs--\\"Kehidupan\\" (\\"Life\\") and \\"Kesaksian\\" (\\"Witness\\")--that were listed by Rolling Stone Indonesia as among the best Indonesian songs of all time. Biography Jockie was born in Demak, Central Java on 14 September 1954. After beginning his education in Demak, he went to Semarang near the end of his primary years to finish elementary school. His middle school education was in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan; while there he joined the local band Safira. Most of his musical skills were self-taught, although he did study composition under Muchtar Embut and musical notation under Idris Sardi. After middle school, Jockie moved to Jakarta and joined with several acts there, before moving to Surabaya, East Java and joining Jaguar, led by Mickey Makelbach. He eventually finished high school in Malang and moved back to Jakarta. In 1973, he joined with Ahmad Albar, Donny Fattah and Ludwig Leeman to form God Bless; their first concert was in Taman Ismail Marzuki in May 1973. He split from the band for a brief time to found the bands Giant Step in Bandung and Double Zero in Malang, but returned in early 1975. During this period he was heavily into drugs, once stealing and selling a ring belonging to songwriter Harry Roesli to fuel his habit. In 1976 Jockie joined the committee for Prambors FM's Teenage Song Writing Competition. Along with Prambors head Imran Amir, he unsuccessfully approached Chrisye to ask him to sing the song \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" (\\"Small Candles\\"); when Chrisye was convinced to record the single by Sys NS, Jockie handled the arrangement. The following year, Jockie collaborated with Chrisye for a new album, Jurang Pemisah (Dividing Canyon); Chrisye provided vocals for seven songs while Jockie provided the vocals for two and wrote several more. In 1977 Jockie joined with Chrisye and Eros Djarot to record the soundtrack to Badai Pasti Berlalu, directed by Teguh Karya. After the film's success, the soundtrack was rerecorded in Pluit, North Jakarta over a period of 21 days and sold as a soundtrack album. The album, also titled Badai Pasti Berlalu, went on to sell 9 million copies over the next sixteen years. In 1978 he released his first solo album, Musik Saya adalah Saya (My Music is Me). This was followed by four more albums over the next 15 years, Yang Terhilang Lepas (Free and Missing), Pernyataan (Statement), Penantian (Waiting), and Selamat Jalan Kekasih (Goodbye Dear). Meanwhile, with God Bless he released Semut Hitam (Black Ants; 1988), Raksasa (Monster; 1989), and Apa Kabar? (What's Up?; 1997). Jockie again worked with Chrisye for the 1979 album Percik Pesona, for which he wrote several songs. The album was a critical and commercial failure, with critics writing that it was too much like Badai Pasti Berlalu. Beginning in 1983, Jockie joined with Chrisye and Djarot to produce a trilogy of albums, Resesi (Recession; 1983), Metropolitan (1983), and Nona (Miss; 1984); the albums all went platinum. During the early 1990s, Jockie joined with Iwan Fals' band Swami to record Kantata Takwa (Cantata of Taqwa). He and the band would often clash over creative differences, but reportedly were willing to compromise. In 1993 he released another solo album, Suket (Grass); he also arranged the music for the album. In it he tried to give social commentary from his observations, a technique previously used by Iwan Fals. In 2003 he left God Bless again after creative differences; in an October 2011 Facebook post, he wrote that he had been forced to leave the group and that he was outraged that the band continued to play his songs without his permission. In a later interview with Kompas, he stated that lead singer Ahmad Albar had pulled a gun on him when debating the latter's drug use. Guitarist Ian Antono confirmed that a pistol was involved, but he thought it could be a toy; he stated that the argument flared up when Jockie insulted Albar's family. Jockie collaborated with numerous artists in October 2009 to put on a tribute concert to Chrisye. Together with Garin Nugroho, in 2010 Jockie helped produce the musical Diana for the Kompas 45th anniversary. For the production, a tribute to Koes Plus, Jockie remastered 20 of their songs. Accolades In December 2009, Rolling Stone Indonesia selected two of Jockie's songs as being among the 150 best Indonesian songs of all time. His composition \\"Kehidupan\\" (\\"Life\\"), from God Bless' album Semut Hitam was ranked 8th, while \\"Kesaksian\\" (\\"Witness\\"), from Iwan Fals' album Kantata Takwa was ranked 82nd. Personal life and death Jockie was married to Tiwi Puspitasari. He had four children. One of his sons, Nara Putra, plays guitar in the band Jibriel alongside the children of several other God Bless members. After Jockie was hospitalised at Pondok Indah Hospital in South Jakarta for complications resulting from diabetes, cirrhosis, and a stroke, on 24 January 2018 a group of musicians (including Nicky Astria, Berlian Hutauruk, and Fariz RM) held a tribute/charity concert at Taman Ismail Marzuki. This concert, titled \\"Pagelaran Sang Bahaduri\\" (Hero's Performance), was reported to have raised Rp 514.04 million (US$38,600) to help pay for Jockie's treatment. On 5 February 2018, Jockie died in the hospital. He was buried at Karet Bivak Cemetery in Jakarta.

Life Zhang Dapeng was born in 1754 as a Buddhist in Guizhou. He was a silkmaker by trade and operated a business with a partner that was surnamed Wang. His partner's son Wang Zheng, was sent to attend examinations in Beijing. While Wang Zheng was there, he encountered the Catholic Church in Beijing, converted and was baptized. Wang Zheng then began trying to convert others to the faith and when he returned home to Guizhou, he also tried to convert his family there. Zhang Dapeng did not want to convert, however. He had married a wife named Chen Shi (), but after many years, she had not provided him with a son, so he had taken a concubine as a second wife to produce a child. He then had a son with his second wife named Zhang Dewang () who was born in 1793. Conversion to Christianity would have required him to only have one wife, and because his first wife was seen to be the proper wife and the second wife had the status of a concubine, it would have meant that the mother of his only son had to leave him. A Chinese priest named Luo Madi () was doing missionary efforts in neighbouring Sichuan at that time and he sent a Chinese lay missionary named Hu Shilu (ËÉ°‰∏ñÁ¶Ñ - baptismal name was Lawrence) to go to Guizhou to preach the faith and establish a mission there. Hu Shilu encountered Zhang Dapeng and managed to convince him to change his mind about accepting the faith. Zhang Dapeng then agree to send his concubine away. He paid a dowry for her to be married to a Catholic layman that was surnamed Du, and then he began religious instructions to join the Catholic Church. One of his fellow catechumens in the same class was the future Chinese martyr saint Wu Guosheng (Âê¥ÂõΩÁõõ - baptismal name was Peter, also called Peter Wu). He was baptized in the year 1800 baptized at the age 46 by Fr. Luo Madi. After the baptism, he started to preach the word of the Roman Catholic Church. He taught over a thousand people to accept Catholicism. He also sometimes helped in doing service for poor elderly people and orphans. He also spent three years working as a headmaster and teacher at a Catholic school that was set up by a missionary in Guiyang. Some of his relatives were angry at his attempts to proselytize and they made false accusations against him to the government that he was a member of the White Lotus society that had been conspiring against the Qing dynasty. His wife and son eventually joined the faith after he had and were baptized too. His son took the baptismal name of Anthony. Because of his preaching, the Mandarins wanted to imprison him because some of the local Chinese disliked foreign religious beliefs. This also coincided with the new wave of persecution initiated by the Jiaqing Emperor in the 1810s against Christians in China. Soon, his son was captured by the Mandarins and died in 1813. Zhang Dapeng heard of his son's death and fled to Sichuan. His brother-in-law betrayed him to the authorities for a monetary reward and then Zhang Dapeng was captured and was imprisoned in the year 1814. He was put into the same prison that was holding Wu Guosheng and other Christians arrested for the faith. They were presented with a crucifix and told to trample on it, but Zhang Dapeng refused. Zhang Dapeng's nephew offered to pay him a large sum of money if he would renounce Christ, but Zhang Dapeng still refused, saying 'What use is silver to me? You can buy me body, but you can't buy my soul.' The officials judged Zhang Dapeng as guilty of violating the law by following an evil cult and working to spread it to others. Zhang Dapeng was ordered to be executed. His relatives still tried to call for him to give up the faith while there was still time, but he refused. He was tied to a crucifix shaped like a capital letter T and the executioner used a rope around his neck to strangle him to death. On 12 March 1815, Zhang Dapeng was killed by the Mandarins at the age of 61.Zhang Dapeng A big storm started after he died, which was interpreted as an omen by people that were there. People in later times would go to his gravesite to collect plants for medicine and they believed these plants had special healing properties. Family life Zhang Dapeng had two wives and a son named Dewang Dapeng. Zhang Dapeng also had two brothers named Dakui and Daxue.

It is notable as the site of a number of acts of anti-abortion violence. Perhaps best-known was the 1994 murder of Dr. John Britton. Britton was a physician working at the clinic; he and his escort James Barrett were shot to death as they arrived on July 29 by anti-abortion protester Paul Jennings Hill. Barrett's wife June was also wounded. Previously, the clinic had been bombed twice in 1984; a pipe bomb destroyed the building on June 25 of that year, and four youths--Matt Goldsby, Jimmy Simmons, Kathy Simmons, and Kaye Wiggins--bombed it on Christmas Day, calling the crime \\"a gift to Jesus on his birthday.\\" These bombers stated that they were also behind the June bombing. On January 1, 2012, Bobby Joe Rogers firebombed the clinic with a Molotov cocktail; the fire gutted the building. Rogers told investigators that he was motivated to commit the crime by his opposition to abortion, and that what more directly prompted the act was seeing a patient enter the clinic during one of the frequent anti-abortion protests there.

She was built and launched at Bursledon in 1797 and served in the English Channel, off North America, and in the Mediterranean. She was briefly flagship of both Admiral Mark Milbanke and Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell during her career, and was present at the Battle of Navarino. Cambrian was wrecked off the coast of Grabusa in 1828. Design Ordered on 30 April 1795, Cambrian was designed by Sir John Henslow and built by George Parsons of Bursledon. She represented the first attempt to design a frigate that would carry 24-pounder guns and was one of several designs the Admiralty ordered to find a counter to French 24-pounder frigates. For her design, Henslow essentially simply scaled-up an earlier design. However, she was still too small to carry 24-pounder long guns comfortably and so the Admiralty replaced these first with lighter 24-pounders (in April 1799) and then with 18-pounders in 1805. French Revolutionary Wars She was first commissioned in April 1797 under Captain Thomas Williams on the Irish station. Then under Captain Arthur Legge she served in the Channel, where she captured a number of French privateers. On 11 January 1798, in company with and Childers, she captured the French privateer schooner Vengeur. Vengeur was a new vessel of 12 guns and 72 men. She was eight days out of Ostend but had taken no prizes. Pellew sent her into Falmouth. Five days later, in the evening of 16 January, Sir Edward Pellew's squadron captured the French privateer Inconcevable. She was armed with eight guns and had a crew of 55 men. She was 10 days out of Dunkirk and had taken nothing. Prize money was paid to Indefatigable, Cambrian and . On 28 January, Indefatigable and Cambrian captured the privateer Heureuse Nouvelle. She was armed with 22 guns and had a crew of 130 men. She was 36 days out of Brest and during that time had capture only one ship, a large American vessel named Providence, which had a cargo of cotton and sugar. The hired armed cutter also shared in the capture. Pellew sent Cambrian in pursuit of Providence, and that same day Cambrian and Indefatigable recaptured her. On 27 March 1798, Cambrian captured C√¶sar, a French privateer ship of 16 guns and 80 men. She was from Saint-Malo and 35 days out of Brest. Six days earlier, Cambrian and had recaptured William Pen of Philadelphia. Then three days after capturing C√¶sar, Cambrian captured Pont de Lodi, which was also French privateer ship, and which carried 16 guns and 102 men. Pont de Lodi was five days out of Bordeaux, on her maiden cruise, and had not yet captured anything. Near the end of the year, on 8 December, Cambrian captured the French privateer brig Cantabre. Cantabre, which was armed with 14 guns and which carried a crew of 60 men, was, according to Legge, \\"quite new... on her first Cruize, and a very fine Vessel.\\" Four days later, Cambrian recaptured Dorothea, a Danish brig sailing from Amsterdam to Tangiers with a cargo of bale goods. Three days earlier the French privateer brig Rus√©e, of Bayonne had captured her in Lat. 42 Deg. 30 Min, North. Around 20 January 1799, Cambrian encountered a tremendous gale in the Channel, with thunder and lightning. A fireball hit her forecastle, killing two men and wounding seventeen, of whom two were struck blind, and one of whom became \\"raving mad\\". All aboard expected immediate destruction.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 1, p.339. Some months later, on 9 March, , , , and Cambrian captured the French merchant ship Victoire. On 9 October 1799, Cambrian was among the several vessels that shared in the capture of the Spanish brig Nostra Senora de la Solidad. Then on 23 October, Cambrian recaptured Sarah. Cambrian also shared in the capture of the Spanish brig San Joachim by Triton. Ten days later, Cambrian was in company with off the entrance to the Garonne when they spotted two vessels, which they immediately chased. Stag captured one, the letter of marque Heureux Premier, which was armed with 10 brass 6-pounder guns, and which was sailing from Cayenne to Bordeaux with a cargo of red dye, cotton, cocoa, coffee, and sugar. Cambrian sailed after the second vessel, a privateer of 26 guns, but apparently did not succeed in capturing her. Stag did share the prize money for Heureux Premier with Cambrian. At the end of the month, on 30 October, the American ship Sally came into Plymouth. Cambrian had recaptured her after Sally had been captured by the French privateer Vengeance, of 20 guns and 160 men.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 2, p.541. Cambrian sailed in pursuit of Vengeance, but did not succeed in capturing her. On 23 April 1800, Cambrian and were in company when they captured the French schooner Emelie. Four days later the two vessels were still in company when Fisgard captured the French privateer Dragon. Then on 5 May Cambrian and Fisgard captured the French brig corvette Dragon, pierced for 14 guns but armed with 10, and with a crew of 72 men under the command of Lieutenant de Vaisseau Lachurie. She was two days out of Rochefort with dispatches for Guadeloupe. Eleven months later, on 5 April 1801, Cambrian recaptured the letter of marque , which the French privateer Braave had captured three days earlier. Cambrian shared the prize money with and . The next day Cambrian captured the French privateer lugger Audacieux. Audacieux was armed with 14 guns and carried a crew of 50 men under the command of S.B. Ant. Candeau. Audacieux had left Bordeaux on 30 March and while at sea had captured one vessel, an American. Cambrian also shared the prize money for Audacieux with Venerable and Superb. Lastly, on 28 July Cambrian captured the Danish ship Kron Prinz. In November 1804 there was a distribution of a ¬£7000 advance on the prize money for her cargo. As captain, Legge would have been entitled to one-quarter of the prize money, an amount equal to some four years of salary. In May 1802 Captain William Bradley replaced Legge. That same month Cambrian came to serve as flagship to Admiral Mark Milbanke and later (July to March 1803) Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell while on the North America and West Indies Station. Napoleonic Wars Deck, quarter and forecastle of Cambrian In March 1804, Cambrian was under the command of Captain William Bradley and on her way to Bermuda when she captured two French privateers. On 22 March she captured the schooner Tison after a chase of 25 hours. Tison had been armed with six 9 and 12-pounder guns, which she threw overboard during the chase. She had a crew of 59 men under the command of Joseph Kastique, and had been out of Guadaloupe for 11 days buy had not captured anything. Four days later Cambrian captured the schooner Alexander (or Alexandre), which was armed with eight guns and had a crew of 68 men under the command of Charles La Marque. She had been cruising for 11 days but had not taken anything. Head money was paid in June 1827. In October 1804 Cambrian came under the command of Captain John Beresford. From June to November 1804, Cambrian and had blockaded two French frigates in the port of New York. In November, the French vessels succeeded in escaping.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 13, p.64. The two were the Pr√©sident and the other was supposedly the Revolutionnaire.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 13, p.161. Then in May 1805, Cambrian transferred to the Halifax station, where she harassed French and Spanish shipping and captured several privateers and merchantmen. On 13 June her boats, under the command of Lieutenant George Pigot, boarded and captured the Spanish privateer schooner Maria, of 14 guns and 60 men. Somewhat uncharacteristically for privateers, the Spanish resisted, with the result that Cambrian sustained casualties of two dead and two wounded. Next, Cambrian captured the French privateer schooner Matilda on 3 July, after a chase of 22 hours. Matilda, of 200 tons (BM), was armed with twenty 9-pounder guns and had a crew of 95 men. She surrendered in shoal water and if not for the efforts of Lieutenant Pigot in one of Cambrians boats, Matildas entire crew might have been lost. Matilda had earlier captured the letter of marque Clyde, which had been on her way to Liverpool. Prior to her capture by Cambrian, Matilda had evaded capture by Heron. Boat service Then on 7 July Lieutenant Pigot again distinguished himself. He arrived off the harbour the day before and took the Matilda twelve miles up the St Marys River to attack three vessels reported to be there. All long the way militia and riflemen fired on Matilda. Eventually the British reached the vessels, which were lashed in a line cross the river. They consisted of a Spanish privateer schooner and her two prizes, the ship and the British brig Ceres, which the Spanish privateer had captured some two months earlier. The Spaniards had armed Golden Grove with eight 6-pounder guns and six swivels, and given a crew of 50 men. The brig too was armed with swivels and small arms. The Spanish schooner carried six guns and a crew of 70 men. Pigot engaged the vessels for an hour, and after Matilda had grounded, took his crew in her boats and captured Golden Grove. The British then captured the other two vessels. Lastly, Pigot fired on a group of 100 militia and a field gun, dispersing them. The British had two men killed, and 14 wounded, including Pigot, who had received two bullet wounds to his head and one to a leg. Spanish casualties were reportedly 25 men killed (including five Americans) and 22 men wounded. A crowd of Americans on the Georgia side of the river watched the entire battle. Pigot was unable to extricate himself and his prizes from the river until 21 July, but during the entire period he remained in command except when he was getting his wounds dressed. For his efforts Pigot received a promotion to commander, and the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund awarded him a medal and a plate worth ¬£50.Long (1895), pp. 421-2 & 435. On 1 November, Cambrian captured Adeline. Leander affair In 1806, Cambrian came under the command of Captain John Nairne (acting). While under his command she, along with Leander and the ship-sloop , was engaged in searching American vessels coming from foreign ports, for enemy property and contraband.James (1837), Vol. 4, p.236. This gave rise to the so-called Leander affair with the result that on 14 June President Thomas Jefferson issued a proclamation ordering Leander, Driver, and Cambrian immediately to quit US waters and forbidding them ever to return. He extended the same prohibition to all vessels that their respective captains might command.Draft of Proclamation concerning \\"Leander\\" - Thomas Jefferson, The Works of Thomas Jefferson, vol. 10 (Correspondence and Papers 1803-1807) [1905], Ed. Paul Leicester Ford, Federal Edition (New York and London, G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1904-5). On 26 April, the day after the affair, Leander, Cambrian, and Driver captured the American ship Aurora. Cambrian continued to cruise, including sailing to Charlestown to lift a blockade of the port by three French privateers.Ralve (1828), p.6. Later, Nairne sailed Cambrian back to Britain in order to be a witness at the court martial of Captain Henry Whitby of Leander for the murder of John Pierce, the American supposedly killed by a shot from Leander, which was the substance of the affair. (Whitby was acquitted.) Between April and June 1807 Cambrian was at Portsmouth, refitting. Copenhagen Captain the Honourable Charles Paget took command in May 1807. Cambrian then participated in the Expedition to Copenhagen. In October her captain was James Deans (acting), while Paget took up Admiral Gambier's offer to let him return to Britain in with the duplicate despatches announcing Denmark's capitulation.Paget & Paget (1896), Vol. 2, pp.352-3. Paget later resumed command. On 14 January 1808, Cambrian was under Paget's command when she captured the French ship Aeleon. Spain's Mediterranean coast On 9 May Paget sailed Cambrian for the Mediterranean. The next month he transferred to . His successor was Captain Richard B. Vincent. Captain Francis William Fane replaced Vincent in 1809. On 5 September 1810 Cambrian sailed from Tarragona with General Doyle and two xebecs carrying Spanish soldiers and some cannons. Their objective was the fort on Meda Gran in the Medes Islands, in the Bay of Rosas near the mouth of the River Ter. The next day the Spanish frigate Flora joined them. When it turned out that an assault on the fort was impossible, on 10 September Doyle led a landing party of soldiers and marines from the frigates to attack a battery of four 24-pounder guns (two mounted) at Bega (or Bagur). The attack was successful with the attackers capturing 36 men while sustaining no casualties. Then on 14 September boats from Cambrian assisted the Spanish in their attack on Palam√≥s. The attack cost Cambrian three men wounded and the loss of a launch to fire from a French battery. On 17 September Cambrian left Palam√≥s with the French cannon and prisoners that had been captured, together with Spanish General O'Donnell, who had been shot in the leg during the battle. Cambrian returned him to Tarragona on 17 September. General O'Donnell had the Spanish government strike a medal for the British officers involved in the two actions (in gold), and the same medal in silver for the Royal Marines at Bagur and the sailors in the boats at Palam√≥s. On 13 December British 350 sailors and 250 marines from Cambrian, the 74-gun third rates Kent and again attacked Palam√≥s. (The sloops and covered the landing.) The landing party destroyed six of eight merchant vessels with supplies for the French army at Barcelona, as well as their escorts, a national ketch of 14 guns and 60 men and two xebecs of three guns and thirty men each. The vessels were lying inside the mole under the protection of 250 French troops, a battery of two 24-pounders, and a 13\\" mortar in a battery on a commanding height. Although the attack was successful, the withdrawal was not. The British lost 33 men killed, 89 wounded, and 86 taken prisoner, plus one seaman who took the opportunity to desert.James (1837), Vol. 5, pp.259-60. Cambrian alone lost one man killed, seven wounded, and four men missing, among them Fane, who had been taken prisoner. Captain Charles Bullen of Volontier then took command of Cambrian on 1 January 1811.Broadley & Bartelot (1906) p.255-6. Bullen continued to support the Spanish in operations along the Catalan coast. On 14 April boats from Cambrian cut out a settee carrying grain from Port Vendee to Barcelona that had sheltered under the protection of batteries on the Medes Islands. More importantly, on 12 and 14 April, Cambrian and Volontaire took possession of St. Philion and Palam√≥s. There they destroyed the batteries and took out their guns. This, together with the Spanish capture of Figueras, gave the Spanish control of almost all Catalonia, save Barcelona. Returning to the Bay of Rosas, Bullen captured 19 merchant vessels off Cadaques. He sent six, which were loaded with wine and grain to Tarragona for the garrison there. In June, while serving in a battery ashore at Selva, he was badly wounded.Heathcote (2005) p.20. Bullen quit Cambrian on 9 December and returned to England invalided. Cambrian refitted at Gibraltar and then sailed to Malta. From there she convoyed a large number of French prisoners to Britain. On 20 November 1811 Cambrian arrived in Portsmouth. She was then paid off at Plymouth in December. She underwent substantial repair at Plymouth between May 1813 and September 1814, but then was laid up. Post- war Gawen William Hamilton Between July and October 1820 Cambrian was fitted for sea, and in July Captain Gawen Hamilton recommissioned her. He then conveyed Lord Strangford to be ambassador to the Ottoman court at Constantinople. In October 1821, as a result of piracy in the region, Cambrian was escorting merchant shipping between the islands off Smyrna. Hamilton, though an advocate for the cause of Greek independence, was widely respected by Greeks and Ottomans for his impartiality in the conflict. After the Greeks captured Nauplia on 12 December 1821, they were still negotiating the surrender of the Ottoman troops in the fortress above the town when Cambrian arrived on 24 December. Hamilton arranged for the evacuation of the Ottoman troops with Theodoros Kolokotronis and the other Greek leaders. Cambrian herself took 500 on board, with another 900 going on board ships that Hamilton insisted the Greek government charter. Unfortunately, 67 of the Ottomans died of typhus on board Cambrian; several of her crew died of it as well. However, by intervening, Hamilton had staved off a massacre.Finlay (1861), p.369.The Greek government made Nauplia the first capital of an independent Greece. In November 1822, Midshipman Edward Codrington, one of her officers and the son of Admiral Sir Edward Codrington, drowned. Midshipman Codrington had been taking a cutter to Hydra when a squall overturned the boat, drowning him, a merchant, and three crewmen.Marshall (1823), Vol. 1, Part 2, pp.875-6.Bourchier (1873), Vol. 1, pp.347-9 On 18 March 1824 captured Quattro Fratelli . Cambrian shared the prize money. That same year Hamilton conducted a mission to Tunis. He then sailed Cambrian back to Britain where she was paid off, but in July he recommissioned her for the Mediterranean.Gentleman's magazine, (1835), Vol. 157, p.97. In 1825 Cambrian was lead vessel of a small squadron in anti-piracy operations in the Archipelago, at Alexandria, and around the coasts of Syria. She shared in the destruction of two Greek pirate vessels on 31 January and another on 9 June. For the first vessel Cambrian was in company with and .{refnA first-class share of the prize money was worth ¬£159 8s 3d; a sixth-class share was worth 10s 2¬Ωd.group=Mpte For the second, Cambrian was in company with Seringapatam and . Cambrian alone destroyed another Greek pirate vessel on 27 July 1826. The capture and destruction of the two pirate vessels on 31 January 1825 was an unusually sanguine affair. When the pirate vessels refused to surrender, Cambrian and Seringapatam sent in their boats to capture them. Each of the pirate vessels was armed with a gun and had a crew of about thirty men. Both resisted strongly before the British were able to overcome them. Cambrian had three men killed and five wounded; Seringapatam had three killed and eight wounded. All the pirates, save for a few who were captured, were killed or wounded. On 27 July 1826 Cambrians boats captured a pirate bombard and burnt a mistico on the Cycladic island of Tinos.Bombard in this context represents a type of small merchant vessel of two masts, not a bomb vessel. Five pirates were killed and several wounded. Then in early September, Cambrians marines landed on Andros where they burnt a pirate vessel and captured a bombard. During this period Alacrity and Seringapatam also succeeded in destroying several pirate vessels. On 27 June 1827, boats from Cambrian and destroyed a pirate vessel that had a crew of 30 men. On 14 October 1827, Cambrian, still under Captain Hamilton, joined the allied fleet just outside the Bay of Navarino. On the 20th, she entered the bay with the rest of the fleet, where she took part in the Battle of Navarino. Cambrian's casualties were light; she had one crew member killed and one wounded. For his role in the battle, Hamilton received the medal of the second class of the order of St. Anne of Russia and was made a member of the French order of St. Louis. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issuance of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Navarino\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. Fate In January 1828, Cambrian was again involved in the suppression of piracy as part of a squadron under Commodore Sir Thomas Staines. Staines took a small squadron to the island of Grabusa, off Cape Busa (Vouxa) to deal with a nest of Greek pirates that had made the harbour there their home after the Greeks had taken possession of it early in the war against the Turks in Crete. The squadron consisted of Cambrian, Pelican, , , , , and two French corvettes.Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, pp.451-2. In the port there were 14 Greek vessels, together with an Austrian and an Ionian merchantman that the pirates had taken. After the pirates had refused to surrender, the squadron opened fire and destroyed a number of the vessels. Marines from Pelican and Isis then landed to take possession of the fortress there. However, as the squadron left, Isis struck Cambrian, causing her to broadside the rocks in the narrow channel. Cambrian settled in shallow water and her entire crew left in an orderly manner.Hepper (1994), p. 159. The strong swell then broke up Cambrian.

Life He was born at Bolton, Lancashire and was brought up in Staffordshire. At the age of 18 he became a pupil of James Heath, for about two years. Robinson was one of the nine eminent engravers who, in 1836, petitioned the House of Commons on the state engraving in this country, and who with others in 1837, addressed a petition to the king asking for the admission of engravers to the highest rank in the Royal Academy: which was not conceded until some years later. In 1856, Robinson was elected an \\"associate engraver of the new class\\", and in the following year missed election as a full member only by the casting vote of Sir Charles Eastlake, which was given to George Thomas Doo; on the retirement of the latter in 1867 he was elected a royal academician. Robinson received a first-class gold medal at the Paris International Exhibition of 1855. He died at New Grove, Petworth, Sussex, where he had long resided, on 21 October 1871, aged 75. Late in life he married a lady of property, which rendered him financially independent of his art. He was a justice of the peace for the county of Sussex and an honorary member of the Imperial Academy of the Fine Arts at St. Petersburg. Works Robinson's 1835 engraving of Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport, after a painted portrait by Lemuel Francis Abbott In 1823 Robinson was commissioned to engrave for the Artists' Fund The Wolf and the Lamb, the copyright of which had been donated by William Mulready, one of the founders of the Fund. The plate, for which the engraver received 800 guineas, proved a success. In 1824 Robinson sent to the exhibition of the Society of British Artists six engravings: The Abbey Gate, Chester, a Gipsy, and four portraits, including that of Georgiana, Duchess of Bedford, after Sir George Hayter; but he never exhibited again there. In the next few years he engraved many private portraits and illustrations for books, including A Spanish Lady, after Gilbert Stuart Newton, for the Literary Souvenir of 1827; The Minstrel of Chamonix, after Henry W. Pickersgill, for the Amulet of 1830; The Flower Girl, after Philip A. Gaugain, for the Forget me not of 1830; and three plates, after Thomas Stothard, for Samuel Rogers's Italy (1830),24 plates after various artists for Le Bibliophile Jacob' 'Galerie des Femmes de Geoges Sand' 1843 . Among his more important works were: *The Emperor Theodosius refused admission into the Church by St. Ambrose; and *a portrait of the Countess of Bedford. These were both after the pictures by Anthony van Dyck in the National Gallery. *James Stanley, Earl of Derby, and his Family, also after Anthony van Dyck; *The Spanish Flower Girl, after Murillo; *Napoleon and Pope Pius VII, after Sir David Wilkie; *Sir Walter Scott, after Sir Thomas Lawrence; *The Mother and Child, after Charles Robert Leslie; *Little Red Riding Hood (Lady Rachel Russell), The Mantilla (Hon.

P. Stephanoff; and *Bon Jour, Messieurs, after Frank Stone. He sent to the Royal Academy of Arts exhibition in 1861 and again in 1864 his plate of Anne Russell, Countess of Bedford, after a picture by van Dyck at Petworth, which he reworked from time to time. Further portraits were those of: *George Bidder, the calculating boy, after Miss Hayter; *Nicholas I of Russia, after George Dawe; *Napoleon Bonaparte, when first consul, after Jean-Baptiste Isabey; *Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, after Thomas Phillips; *Baron Bunsen, after George Richmond; *Luigi Lablache, after Thomas Carrick; and many others.

Bradley Mengel. 2009. Carter is a US secret agent, code-named N-3, with the rank of Killmaster. He works for AXE ‚Äì a secret arm of the US intelligence services. Publishing history The book was first published in January 1966 (Number A163F) by Award Books part of the Beacon-Signal division of Universal Publishing and Distributing Corporation (New York, USA), part of the Conde Nast Publications Inc. The novel was written by Manning Lee Stokes.http://www.spyguysandgals.com/sgShowAuthor.asp?ScanAuthor=Stokes_Manning_Leehttp://gadetection.pbworks.com/w/page/7931579/Stokes,%20Manning%20Lee Plot summary The story is set in September 1965. Carter is assigned to Mission Sappho ‚Äì to kidnap British scientist Alicia Todd ‚Äì holidaying on the Costa Brava with her Russian spy lover ‚Äì or kill her if she resists. Todd has developed a secret formula known as the Paradise Pill which has the ability to greatly enhance a soldier‚Äôs morale and stamina. However, Todd has not left any written records of the formula and has committed the details to memory. First, Carter contacts AXE agent Gay Lord in Tangier, Morocco. She knows where Todd is staying from her dealings with die Spinne (The Spider) ‚Äì a Spanish underground group who smuggle Nazis out of Europe. Gay Lord kept tabs on the current whereabouts of the smuggled Nazis and reported back to AXE. The Spider has recently fragmented into two factions ‚Äì the largest led by Judas ‚Äì Carter‚Äôs adversary in Run, Spy, Run and The China Doll. Gay Lord was a double agent; doctoring her reports to AXE about the location of the Nazis in exchange for cash to fund her extravagant lifestyle. The smaller faction of The Spider (led by El Lobo) discovered her involvement and killed her. Carter escapes from Tangier and travels to a villa near L'Estartit on the Costa Brava where Russian agent Tasia Loften is seducing Alicia Todd. Carter discovers that Judas' men will raid the villa and attempt to kidnap Todd. Carter arrives at the villa just as it is besieged by Judas' men. Carter arranges a truce with the Russian spy in exchange for help in escaping the villa. Under the influence of narcotics, Todd panics and bolts and is captured by Judas. Carter and Tasia join forces to evade capture and rescue Todd. They are summoned to meet Judas at the bullfighting arena in Girona where he intends to sell Todd to the highest bidder. Tasia knows that Russia will be outbid by the Americans so she plants heroin on Carter causing him to be arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking before he can complete a deal with Judas. Tasia follows Judas to a monastery near La Jonquera / Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste on the France-Spain border where Todd is imprisoned. Carter is rescued from the police cells by the smaller Spider group led by Carmena Santos ‚Äì El Lobo's granddaughter. They want Carter's help to kill Judas and reunite the two Spider factions. Carter leads the assault on the monastery; he is to disable the electric fence, machine gun posts and searchlights to allow El Lobo's men to enter. Inside the monastery, Tasia secretly contacts a Russian commando outpost in nearby Andorra to come to her assistance. Carter betrays El Lobo's men by signaling that all is clear when in fact he has not disabled the monastery's security systems. El Lobo and his men attack and a vicious firefight with Judas' forces ensues during which Carmena Santos is killed. The Russian commandos arrive and join the assault on the monastery. Sensing that the end is near, Judas imprisons Carter and Tasia in a sealed coffin perched on the monastery walls ready to be tipped into the moat and makes his escape with Alicia Todd by river. Carter and Tasia escape from the coffin and follow Judas. Judas and Todd are tipped into the water approaching some rapids and scramble to the river bank. Judas bargains with Carter ‚Äì his freedom in exchange for Todd. Carter agrees but finds that Todd is already dead. Judas escapes in Carter's car which is attacked by El Lobo's men seeking revenge for the causing the death of Carmena. Judas is presumed to be dead. After escaping a manhunt by the Spanish police and military, Carter and Tasia take refuge in Barcelona. Carter discovers that Tasia succeeded in extracting some information from Todd before her death and takes it from her. He leaves her some money and tells her she must choose to defect or return to Russia. Back in the US, Carter learns that Tasia has returned to Russia but her fate is unknown. The information she extracted from Todd was examined by experts and found to be worthless.

He graduated MB, ChB in 1921, having served as a medical student in Royal Navy minesweepers in the North Sea during the first world war. He started to smoke at the age of 16 and continued for 12 years. He was married to his wife Frieda for 55 years. They had a son, Ivor, and two daughters, Heather and Sandra. Career In a paper published in the Lancet in 1942 and titled Tobacco smoking and nicotine, he identified smoking as one of the main causes of lung cancer and effectively became one of the first anti-smoking campaigners by suggesting a total ban on smoking. His views were based on an experiment of his own device in which he injected himself with heavy doses of nicotine, almost killing himself several times in the process. He subsequently enlisted the help of 35 volunteers and found that they eventually preferred nicotine injections to cigarettes. In the 1950s, Dr Johnston was refused research funding by the Medical Research Council and his key paper was rejected by the (pipe-smoking) editor of the British Medical Journal. After storming out of the editorial offices shouting ‚ÄòAddict! Addict!

Nothing is known of Athanasius's origins or early life. The historian Procopius of Caesarea and the African poet Corippus record only that by 545 he was elderly.. Two members of Athanasius's family are known: his brother, the comes and senator Alexander, who led embassies to Sassanid Persia and Ostrogothic Italy in the early 530s,. and his son-in-law Leontius, who led an embassy to the Franks in 551.. Athanasius first appears in 536, when he was sent to Italy alongside Peter the Patrician to accept the surrender of Gothic forces, as Peter and the Ostrogothic king, Theodahad, had agreed in previous embassies. Theodahad, however, upon learning of Byzantine reversals in Dalmatia and of the death there of the general Mundus in battle with Gothic forces, took heart and resolved to resist the Byzantine attack. The two Byzantine envoys were arrested, while the war recommenced. They remained imprisoned in Ravenna for three years, until released in June/July 539 by the new Gothic king, Witigis, in exchange for Gothic envoys sent to Persia who had been captured by the Byzantines. On their arrival in Constantinople, Emperor Justinian rewarded them both with high office, appointing Peter as his magister officiorum and Athanasius as praetorian prefect of Italy.. Athanasius arrived again in Italy in the early spring of 540, but little is known of his tenure, except that he accompanied the commanders dispersed by Belisarius around Italy, perhaps to organize their supplies. Athanasius probably held the post until summer/autumn 542, when replaced by Maximinus, but seems to have remained in Italy as late as 544.. In early 545, shortly after his return from Italy, Emperor Justinian dispatched Athanasius as praetorian prefect to Africa, alongside the aged senator Areobindus, who was named as the province's new magister militum. Areobindus soon faced a military revolt led by the dux Numidiae, Guntharic. In March 546, Guntharic seized Carthage and imprisoned Athanasius and Areobindus. When summoned before the rebel, Athanasius presented himself as his supporter and took care to flatter Guntharic. This, and his advanced age, may have saved him later, when Areobindus was murdered during a dinner in the palace... According to Corippus, Athanasius then masterminded the palace coup that murdered Guntharic and restored Byzantine imperial control over Africa a few months later: the Armenian officer Artabanes murdered the rebel at a banquet. Although Procopius does not mention Athanasius's role, according to the authors of the PLRE this is likely because Artabanes, or one of his close associates, was Procopius's source for the episode. At any rate, after Guntharic's death, Athanasius moved quickly to secure control of his treasury.. Athanasius continued in office and was instrumental in the reorganization of the Byzantine forces under John Troglita in the winter of 547/548, following the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Marta. He was still in office circa 550, but he was replaced at the latest by September 552.. Nothing further is known of him, although he may be the same as the senator Athanasius who was sent to Lazica in 556 to investigate the murder of king Gubazes II by the Byzantine generals stationed there, and to examine the accusations of treason levelled by the latter against Gubazes..

History After the 6th century BC it is known that people of Mongolian ethnicity played stringed instruments. The most ancient instrument is probably the tsuur, which is shown in cave wall paintings dated to the 4th or 3rd millennium BC. Other instruments were adopted or modified from instruments in use from neighboring countries, or from conquered countries (for example the Hun/Xioungnu empire 200 BC - 600 and the Mongolian empire between the 12th and 18th century founded by Genghis Khaan). Before the democratic revolution in 1911 several instruments had been restricted to noblemen or for use in monastery ceremonies. The yatga especially wasn't allowed to commoners if the number of strings exceeded eight; only at court could the eleven or twelve stringed yatga be played. In contrast most of the Mongolic ethnicities adopted four instruments for folk music and other oral performances: the Tovshuur, huuchir, morin khuur and the tsuur. Nowadays some ethnicities changed from the tovshuur to the shanz. In modern times some instruments have been adapted like the 21-stringed yatga (about 10 strings added), the morin khuur (modification of the sound box and string material) - or invented in the 1960s for completing orchestras like the \\"ih huur\\", a horse headed double bass, also having a trapezoid sound box. Instruments Most of these instruments had been modified during the 1940s and 1960, for standardization during the communist period in Mongolia and the time after the cultural revolution in China. That means many instruments have a \\"modernized\\" shape, different materials, changed construction details. The traditional shape and the modernized shape is often mentioned in the detail articles. Examples: The traditional morin khuur had mostly a skinned top and bottom, and sound holes at the sides. It was modernized in creating a wooden sound box, F holes and the soundpost. The traditional Yatga had about 8-13 strings, which survived in Korea (Kayaegum) but the modernized shape has 21 Strings (China, Gu Zheng) or 23 Strings (Korea) Mostly all strings of the bowed instruments were made from horse hair, and the plucked instruments had silk or gut strings. Nowadays only the bows have horse hair, but the strings are made from nylon (Morin Khuur, other bowed instruments) or steel (Dulcimer/Yochin, Shanz, Yatga) Plucked *Tovshuur, Topshur (Mongolian: /Tobsigur; Khalkha dialect: Tovshuur; Kalmyk: Topshur; Altai: Topshur) - a two stringed and skinned instrument made from a 4-foot long spoon-alike nomad tool for airag making, especially popular in Oirat territories. All tovshuur are homemade and because of this, the materials and shape of the tovshuur vary depending on the builder and the region. For example, depending on the tribe, the string might be made of horsehair or sheep intestine. The body of the tovshuur is bowl shaped and usually covered in tight animal skin. Also this musical instrument originated from ancient nomads. This musical instrument is much forgotten today in mongolia. *(Shanz, Shudraga) - a plucked three string instrument, widespread across Asia.

Tiensten is currently serving a nine-year sentence for corruption. Tiensten holds a bachelor's degree from the University of Papua New Guinea and a Masters in Resources Law at the Center for Energy, Petroleum, Mineral Law and Policy, University of Dundee, Scotland. He served as a Director of Petroleum at the Department of Petroleum and Energy for the government of Papua New Guinea and was also a Project Manager for the World Bank funded Gas Development and Utilization Technical Assistance Project. Political career Tiensten was first elected to parliament in 2002 and was appointed as the Chairman of the Special Parliamentary Committee on Gas and Energy Development. He was later appointed Trade and Industry Minister on 12 November 2003 and served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2005 to 2007 under then Prime Minister Michael Somare. He was re-elected in 2007 for a second term of Parliament as Minister for National Planning and District Development, but lost his portfolio in August 2011 when a defection of MPs saw the government of Michael Somare disbanded. Controversy Taiwan diplomatic scandal In 2008, Singaporean businessman Wu Shih-tsa alleged in a Taiwanese court that six Papua New Guinea officials, including Paul Tiensten, personally profited from a payment of A$19 million from Taiwan in a bid to strengthen diplomatic relations with Papua New Guinea. Tiensten admitted to meeting the Taiwanese officials, but denied the allegations of corruption. Sam Koim, the chairman of the anti-corruption investigation team Task Force Sweep, announced in December 2011 that he may be investigating the Taiwan diplomatic scandal in early 2012. Kikori misappropriation controversy In January 2010 Minister for Labour and Industrial Relations, Mark Maipakai, who is the member of parliament for Kikori, alleged that the Office of the Minister for National Planning and District Development had been involved in a 220 million kina (US$81.4 million) fraud, together with four landowner associations in Kikori, Gulf Province. The funds were intended for infrastructure projects in Kikori, including roads, houses and a hospital, but were never used for this purpose. Maipakai called on Paul Tiensten to explain why the funds were released by his office without proper project submission, status report, accounting or acquittals. Tiensten denied the allegations of fraud, explaining that the four landowner associations had signed the Benefits Sharing Agreement for the Liquefied Natural Gas project, and so the Government, in return, made the commitment to facilitate the release of infrastructure funds to them. Subsequently the chairman of one of the four landowner associations, the Kikori Gas Pipeline Landowner Association (KGPLA), Mark Sarong, was arrested and charged with ten counts of misappropriation and ten counts of conspiracy. Sarong allegedly went behind the board of directors of the KGPLA and changed the signatories so that he could sign cashable cheques worth substantial amounts, including one cheque for K4 million. Tiensten, with the Minister of Finance, had authorised the release of 17.6 million kina [US$6.6 million] to the KGPLA. The case against Sarong was struck out by the Waigani Committal Court in August 2010 due to a lack of a police brief. Tiensten‚Äôs arrest amid corruption claims In early November 2011, Tiensten was arrested by the government‚Äôs Investigation Task Force Sweep, a corruption investigation task force established by Prime Minister Peter O'Neill. The charges against Tiensten related to the misappropriation of funds, conspiracy to defraud the state and abuse of office, for his part in approving a PGK 10 million payment of air subsidies to the airline company Travel Air. It was alleged that Tiensten conspired with Travel Air's owner, businessman Eremas Wartoto, to make the payment while he was National Planning Minister, despite being aware that the company was inactive. Tiensten had initially fled to Australia in September 2011 when summoned for questioning by the Investigation Task Force Sweep, but was arrested in Papua New Guinea upon his return in November. Tiensten was later arrested in November 2011 by the Investigation Task Force Sweep on three further charges for diverting PGK 3.4 million of government funding to Tolpot Services Ltd, of which he was both a shareholder and a director. In March 2014, he was convicted of misappropriation over 10 million kina, and sentenced to nine years of hard labour.

Biography Personal life Alf was born to artist Martha Alf and Edward F. Alf Jr., a psychology professor at San Diego State University from 1963 until 1988. Alf was known for his height, as he stood 6-foot-6. He attended Kearny High School in San Diego. Alf studied music at the University of California, San Diego. San Diego Comic-Con In 1970, Alf teamed with a group of other comic enthusiasts, including Shel Dorf, Mike Towry, and Ken Krueger, to establish the first Comic-Con annual convention, then known as the San Diego's Golden State Comic-Con. Shel Dorf, who was 35 years old at the time, had conceived the idea for a comic convention, but lacked money and transportation to create the event. Alf, a then 17-year-old senior at Kearny High School, provided Dorf with both the money and transport, in the form of Alf's 1954 Volkswagen Beetle. Alf donated several thousand dollars to fund the convention for its first three years. He would be paid back after the convention. The first convention, known San Diego's Golden State Comic-Con, which was held at the U.S. Grant Hotel in downtown San Diego in 1970, was co-chaired by Alf. Alf became the chairman of the convention in 1971, while he was a music student at the University of California, San Diego. He used his ties to the university to move the convention to campus in 1971, offering discounted dorm rooms as housing for attendees. The dorm idea proved less than successful, as the university placed attendees on the same floors as quiet study groups, such as the Montessori. In 1972, Alf and Mike Towry co-chaired the third annual Comic- Con at the El Cortez in San Diego. The convention, now known as San Diego Comic-Con International, is now an internationally known, four-day annual event held at the San Diego Convention Center. From its small beginnings, Comic-Con now attracts more than 125,000 attendees, with contributions from major celebrities and film studios. Alf largely gave up his unpaid, volunteer positions at Comic-Con later in the 1970s. During the mid-1970s, he opened his own comic book store, called Comic Kingdom, in the University Heights (now Hillcrest) community of San Diego. He sold the comic business in the late 1970s and pursued careers in commodity trading and outdoor advertising. In 2009, Comic-Con honored Alf, Dorf, Krueger, Towry and other co-founders of the convention. In November 2009, Dorf died in San Diego and Krueger died in upstate New York in the same month. Alf contributed to a special project by San Diego State University's library to document the early years and founders of Comic-Con with primary sources. According to Lynn Hawkes, a special projects officer at SDSU, \\"As a very young individual, Richard was not afraid to pursue his passions...He led a very interesting life and created something for the entire community that has been really wonderful.\\" Alf was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in December 2011 after collapsing at his home in Serra Mesa, San Diego. He spent a short time at La Jolla Nursing and Rehabilitation Center before being transferred to the home of his friend, Earl Bookhammer, in Ramona, California. He died at Bookhammer's home in Ramona on January 5, 2012, at the age of 59.

In P. aeruginosa, CrcZ is responsible for sequestering the protein Crc. Crc is an RNA-binding global regulator, which acts by inhibiting the translation of the transcriptional regulator AlkS.  Function  In P. aeruginosa, CrcZ is a 407-nt long RNA which contains 5 CA-rich motifs. CrcZ expression is regulated by the two- component system CbrA/CbrB, in response to the availability of different carbon sources. As the Crc protein inhibits translation of transcriptional regulators by binding to and occluding the translational initiation site, sequestration of Crc by CrcZ binding means that Crc is unable to inhibit translation and transcriptional regulators, such as AlkS, are freely translated. Expression of CrcZ is dependent on the carbon sources available to the bacteria; in the presence of preferred carbon sources (such as succinate), CrcZ expression is low, and catabolite repression is high. In the presence of poor sources of carbon, such as mannitol, CrcZ expression is high, allowing the inhibition of Crc and a subsequent decrease in catabolite repression occurs.

It attempts to strengthen the main weaknesses of the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. The UNIDROIT Convention seeks to fight the illicit trafficking of cultural property by modifying the buyer's behaviour, obliging him/her to check the legitimacy of their purchase. Due diligence and Burden of Proof Claude Monet. Marina. Painting stolen from the , Rio de Janeiro, in 2006 The Convention states that if a cultural property was stolen it must be returned (Chapter II, Art. 3.1). Any possessor of a stolen cultural object required to return it might be compensated only if he/she can prove due diligence at the time of the purchase and that he/she neither knew nor ought reasonably to have known that the objects was stolen (Chapter II, Art. 4.1 ). To assess the legitimacy of the object's origin, art market players can use international and national databases dedicated to cultural property protection, for instance, the INTERPOL Stolen Works of Art Database collects information about stolen cultural property and issues identification numbers to cultural objects. Whereas Chapter II of the Convention deals with stolen cultural objects, Chapter III contemplates the export of cultural property in violation of national export restrictions. A State Party can request the competent Court of another Contracting State to order the return of a cultural object illegally exported from its territory if the removal of the object caused detriment in one of the ways listed under Article 5.3. Again, the burden of proof is on the possessor to demonstrate that he/she \\"neither knew nor ought reasonably to have known at the time of acquisition that the object had been illegally exported\\" (Art. 6.1). These rules apply equally to cultural objects inherited or received as gifts. Either an heir or a beneficiary has the same responsibility as a buyer. Therefore, museums and other public institutions must carry out checks over the origin of donated objects. The 1970 UNESCO Convention and the 1995 UNIDROIT Convention The UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (1970 UNESCO Convention) and the UNIDROIT Convention are compatible and complementary. As distinct from the UNESCO Convention, the UNIDROIT Convention focuses on the recovery of cultural property. The UNIDROIT Convention establishes conditions for claims of restitution/return of stolen or illegally exported cultural objects respectively. Although the UNIDROIT Convention follows key terminology of 1970 UNESCO Convention, cultural goods do not need to be defined as such by the State. Furthermore, the term \\"cultural property\\" is replaced by a more comprehensive \\"cultural object\\", but the list of their categories remains the same. The concept of \\"illicit export\\" is replaced by \\"illegal export\\", which references a prohibitive law rather than a general forbiddance. Time Restrictions to Claims for Repatriation Matthias Withoos. De Grashaven. Stolen from Westfries Museum, Hoorne, in 2005 The Convention regulates the time period that an affected party may bring a claim for the restitution of stolen cultural property or the return of those illegally exported. Such a claim may be brought in three years from the time when the claimant or the requesting State knew the location of the cultural property and the identity of the possessor and in 50 years since the time of the theft, the export or from the date on which the object should have been returned (Art. 3.3 and art. 5.5 ). However, there are exceptions to this rule for stolen objects. Cultural objects that form an integral part of an identified monument or archaeological site, or which belong to a public collection are not subject to time limitation other than a period of three years (Art. 3.4). In addition, a Contracting State may declare that a claim warrants an extended time limit of 75 years or longer if so stated in its national law (Art. 3.5). The UNIDROIT Convention is not a retroactive treaty. Its provisions only apply to cultural property stolen or illegally exported after the Convention entered into force (Art. 10). However the UNIDROIT Convention \\"does not in any way legitimise any illegal transaction of whatever which has taken place before the entry into force of this Convention\\" and does not \\"limit any right of a State or other person to make a claim under remedies available outside the framework\\" of the Convention (Art. 10.3).

After a dismal World Cup campaign in which the team lost all of their matches, the selectors axed the under-performing seniors, and put into place a performance-based contracts. Oluoch met that high-performance criteria, and was thus offered a central contract, a high honour, by the board. As a number of players refused contracts offered by the board and left, Oluoch was one of thirteen players who accepted contracts and remained with the governing body. With Cricket Kenya deciding to leave out players who refused contracts, Oluoch received a call-up to play in the team's Intercontinental Cup and Intercontinental Cup One-Day matches against Netherlands to be held away from home. He made his official One-Day International (ODI) debut against the Dutch at Voorburg in that series (the matches he played against Uganda was only given List A status because Uganda was not an ODI cricket playing nation at that time). He took an impressive three wickets on debut. After an impressive performance in the Netherlands, he was selected in Kenya's home series against the United Arab Emirates. He made his first-class cricket in the ICC Intercontinental Cup at Mombasa Sports Club. Oluoch took a handsome 6/121 on debut, but UAE won the match by 266 runs. Captain Collins Obuya's determined 62 could not prevent the hosts from defeat. Following that, as a part of Kenya's preparations for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, the board announced that the team would play seven unofficial Twenty20 matches in Namibia, followed by games against Zimbabwean franchise teams. Kenya could not manage much on that tour of Namibia, being defeated 6‚Äì2, but Oluoch did have an extraordinary T20 game against Namibia in which he took incredible figures of 4 wickets for 6 runs. Namibia were bowled out for 108, but unfortunately, Kenya were bowled out for an even lower 63 all out as the Namibians romped home by 45 runs. In January 2018, he was named in Kenya's squad for the 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Two tournament. In September 2018, he was named in Kenya's squad for the 2018 Africa T20 Cup. In May 2019, he was named in Kenya's squad for the Regional Finals of the 2018‚Äì19 ICC T20 World Cup Africa Qualifier tournament in Uganda. In September 2019, he was named in Kenya's squad for the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament in the United Arab Emirates.

It was created by American graphic artist James O'Barr, who is best known as the creator of the comic book series The Crow. The comic, which is set in a post-apocalyptic version of the future has been adapted into a short film, by Australian filmmaker Judd Tilyard. The short film which was produced by Tilyard and Liz Tomkins features an animated sequence of new original artwork from James O'Barr as well as a cover of 'Dog Food', the Iggy Pop song referenced in the original graphic novel, from Mondo Generator and featuring Nick Oliveri and Dave Grohl, the track was created for the short film.  Publication history  O'Barr wrote Frame 137 in the early-nineties with plans to create a series of graphic novels to be titled Gothik. Based loosely on the Wizard of Oz and taking place in a bleak, Blade Runner style setting, several short stories from this cyberpunk universe were published in various comics including IO and Snake Dance, which introduced the 'Blixa' character. However in 1994 his press commitments for The Crow, which had just been released, became too demanding and O‚ÄôBarr abandoned the pursuit of the graphic novel.  Adaptations  O‚ÄôBarr authorised an adaptation of the Frame 137 comic into a short film, which was written and directed by Judd Tilyard and is currently in post production. They have been collaborating since on a feature film set in the Frame 137 world and based on O'Barrs original unpublished graphic novel, \\"Gothik\\".  Plot  The 4 page story opens with the young Jonny Z, sitting at the bar of Frame 137 - the underground tech saloon run by Rico, one of the few people Jonny likes and trusts. Jonny's dealer Big T is fashionably late, as always, and Jonny scans the crowd as he wishes cancer variants on T for making him wait. After Big T shows, Jonny swallows a pharmaceutical rainbow of caps and tabs, which cools his previously tweaking system as he waits for the arrival of his 'client', Leo, a Kiddy flesh dealer Jonny's being paid to kill. It's a standard revenge hit, commissioned after Leo moved in and Skinny D's little sister went missing. When Leo arrives, he has two twin A-Steroid Boys as bodyguards, the group takes a booth near the door and Jonny smiles, noting it's not gonna be Leo's night. Jonny's consciousness drowns in memories and amphetamines, as he approaches the booth contemplating his history and what it means to be an assassin. His ceramic Vach 9mm loaded, and out of sight, Jonny confronts Leo and his A-Boys. Leo and Jonny stare each other down, threats are exchanged and tension mounts, a standoff, broken when the A-Boys stand, and Jonny blasts them back down. Jonny swings back around to Leo, catching him still seated he presses his gun to Leo's head. Sweating, Leo tries to talk his way out of the situation. Jonny smiles, and pulls the trigger. Jonny turns and heads for the door. Giving Rico a sign that he'll square up with him for the damage later, he disappears from the bar. The Iggy Pops track \\"Dog Food\\" starts playing over the jukebox as Jonny fades back into the night.

Juvenile hormone (JH) has a profound effect on insects. It regulates embryogenesis, maintains the status quo of larva development and stimulates reproductive maturation in the adult forms. JH is transported from the sites of its synthesis to target tissues by a haemolymph carrier called juvenile hormone-binding protein (JHBP). JHBP protects the JH molecules from hydrolysis by non-specific esterases present in the insect haemolymph. The crystal structure of the JHBP from Galleria mellonella (greater wax moth) shows an unusual fold consisting of a long alpha-helix wrapped in a much curved antiparallel beta-sheet. The folding pattern for this structure closely resembles that found in some tandem-repeat mammalian lipid- binding and bactericidal permeability-increasing proteins, with a similar organisation of the major cavity and a disulfide bond linking the long helix and the beta-sheet. It would appear that JHBP forms two cavities, only one of which, the one near the N- and C-termini, binds the hormone; binding induces a conformational change, of unknown significance.

It is situated at the Bajrakabati Road of Cuttack on the same campus as the Board of Secondary Education, Odisha (BSE). Established in 1959 by the BSE, the school was created as a model high school for imparting education in the Odisha state board system. The school has classes only from Std VI to X. On 3 August 2009, this school celebrated its golden jubilee.  History  In 1952‚Äì53, the Mudaliar Commission's report on Reform in the System of Secondary Education in India suggested a vast set of reforms for the education system. At that time, the educationists-cum-policy makers for Odisha, e.g., Professor B. C. Das, DPI; Shree H. Mishra, DDPI; Dr. S. Sahu, and senior officials of the BSE conceived an idea to establish three model schools at Cuttack, Sambalpur and Berhampur, respectively. Under this initiative, construction of a school, named Secondary Board High School, began at Cuttack in 1958. The school opened on 3 August 1959 with 148 students (including 31 girls), under the guidance of Shree Chakradhar Mohanty, deputed by the BSE as special officer, and nine teachers. It was initially planned to have only three classes, i.e., VI, VII and VIII, and accordingly, admission process began on 9 June 1959 starting with Class-VI. On demand by local guardians, classes IX and X were introduced later. The first batch passed the HSC Examination in 1962 with three years of study in the school, the fully trained first batch passed out in 1965 with all six years of study in the school. Gradually the strength of students grew up to 1,100 by 1984. Campus and buildings Main entrance of the school The school shares the same campus as the BCE and the two buildings stand facing each other. Although the campus has a gate at the entrance on Bajrakabati Road, there is no clear demarcation or boundary walls for the entire campus. House system The school has classes from VI to X with three sections in classes VI and VII and four sections in classes VIII, IX, X. Each of the sections or houses is named after one of the states of India. On 3 August each year, when the school celebrates its annual day, each of the houses makes a display of the rich culture of the it associated state. This display is evaluated each year and the best house is selected.

Early life and career Sahib Singh Sokhey was born in Amritsar, Punjab on 15 December 1887 to Sardar Jwala Singh Sokhey, a civil engineer who worked on various irrigation projects in the Punjab and in Burma, then part of British India. A brilliant student, he completed his initial studies at the Central Medical School and at Government College, Lahore, taking an honours degree in physics and chemistry from the University of the Punjab in 1905. After a year at the Lahore Medical College (now King Edward Medical University), he went to the University of Edinburgh in 1907. At Edinburgh, he completed his MBBS degree in 1911, followed by an MA in economics in 1912. In 1913, Sokhey sat the Indian Medical Service (IMS) examinations, passing first. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the IMS on 26 July 1913. During the First World War, he served in France on the Western Front, and was promoted to captain on 26 July 1916 (antedated to 1 September 1915). After the war, he served in Mesopotamia until 1921, when he returned to India. He subsequently commanded the Indian Military Hospital at Kolkata for two years. Medical researcher In 1923, he was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship for post-graduate studies abroad. From 1923 to 1925, he studied clinical biochemistry under noted American biochemist Otto Folin at Harvard University, subsequently studying in Toronto under Nobel laureate John MacLeod, a co-discoverer of insulin. He was promoted to major on 26 January 1925, and completed an MD from Edinburgh the same year, also conducting research on nutrition at Trinity College, Cambridge under the distinguished biochemist and future Nobel laureate Frederick Gowland Hopkins. Following his return to India in mid-1925, Major Sokhey was appointed an assistant director at the Haffkine Institute in Mumbai on 18 August of that year. His earliest research at the Institute involved the biochemistry of coeliac disease, then known as \\"sprue.\\" In connection with this research, Sokhey conducted clinical studies of the metabolisms of men and women in Mumbai, to compare their metabolisms with those of Europeans. In 1926, he established a Biochemistry Department at the Institute, becoming its first Indian director in 1932. He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 26 January 1933. As Director, Colonel Sokhey expanded the scope of the Institute, establishing an Entomology Department (1938), a Serum Department (1940) to manufacture vaccines, antitoxins and snake antivenin, a Chemotherapy Department (1940) to conduct research into sulfa and synthetic pharmaceuticals, a Pharmacology Department (1943) and a Nutrition Department (1944). From 1932 through the Second World War, Sokhey primarily focused on expanding the Institute's vaccine production and development capacity and improving the quality of its various vaccines and antitoxins. Under Sokhey's supervision, the Institute initiated studies on antibiotic therapies for plague, beginning with sulfathiazole in 1939 and continuing with tetracyclines and related antibiotics during and after the Second World War. In 1943, due to wartime needs, the Indian Medical Service was merged with the Indian Medical Department and the Indian Hospital and Nursing Corps, becoming the Indian Army Medical Corps. Sokhey was promoted to colonel in the newly reorganised service branch on 15 December 1944 (seniority from 26 January 1936). Towards the end of the war, Sokhey established pilot plants at the Institute to manufacture sulfathiazole, paludrine, chloroquine and penicillin. From 1944-1946, he served on the Pharmaceutical and Drug Committee of the government Planning Department. He also served on a committee tasked with establishing the National Chemical Laboratory and the National Physical Laboratory. In 1946, he was among the key individuals involved in establishing a penicillin manufacturing plant, which later became Hindustan Antibiotics. On 14 August 1947, the day before Indian independence, Sokhey was promoted to the local rank of major-general in his role as director of the Haffkine Institute, subsequently retiring from the Indian Army. World Health Organization and later life In 1949, General Sokhey retired from the directorship of the Haffkine Institute after a 17-year tenure. During a visit to Bombay, Brock Chisholm, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, met Sokhey; impressed by his achievements, he offered Sokhey the post of Assistant Director General (Technical Services) in the WHO, with the responsibility for epidemiology, health statistics and biological standardisation. Sokhey served in this position in Geneva until 1952, when he completed his term and returned to India. In 1952, he was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament, retiring a few years later. In 1953-54, Sokhey obtained the assistance of Soviet officials to build a large public-sector pharmaceutical plant in India, today known as Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited (IDPL). In his retirement, Sokhey chaired the All-India Peace Council and the Pharmaceutical and Drugs Committee of the CSIR. In 1962, he became a personal advisor to the Director-General of the CSIR, Syed Hussein Zahir, and was appointed an Emeritus Scientist in 1965. He died at his New Delhi residence on 24 October 1971, aged 83. Personal life Sokhey was married to Leila Roy (1899-1947), a famous kathak dancer known as \\"Madame Menaka.\\" Lady Sokhey spent much of her career travelling across India and Europe with her dance troupe. Her death in 1947 left Sokhey a lonely widower. The couple had no children, and Sokhey never remarried. Sokhey was a voracious reader, with a good understanding of classical Indian art. A close friend of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, he was a convinced leftist with a deep admiration for Communism and the Soviet Union. Honours Sokhey was a founding Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy (1935), and of the Indian Academy of Sciences. For his achievements as director of the Haffkine Institute, especially in the area of vaccine production and development, Sokhey was knighted in the British 1946 New Year Honours list, and was formally invested with his knighthood by the Viceroy, Lord Wavell, at Viceroy's House (now Rashtrapati Bhavan) in New Delhi on 9 March 1946. He was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize by the Soviet government in 1947.

They go to an auction to buy some furniture, but when he sees a statue that resembles socialite Iris Mabby (Diana Lewis), the woman he adores from afar, he buys it, over the Coneys' objections. As Lambert is leaving, Iris's father, Senator Mabby (Berton Churchill), tries to buy the statue from him, but Lambert refuses to sell at any price. Their bargaining attracts the attention of a street reporter (John Ridgely), and the story of the humble office worker turning down a large sum of money gets into the media. The senator rushes off before he can be recognized. It turns out that Senator Mabby is mounting a public campaign against nudity, and the artwork (for which his daughter posed) would be terribly embarrassing to him. Iris does not care. Iris visits Lambert, curious about the buyer. She finds he is like no other man she has ever met, and encourages him to stand firm against her father. Julia Becker, the sculptor, also pays a visit. Despite his weak protests, she insists she will send him two companion statues (also based on Iris). Meanwhile, crook Hymie Atlas (Raymond Hatton) decides the statue must be worth a lot of money. He and his two thugs, Slug (William Haade) and Dimples (Tom Kennedy), barge into Lambert's apartment to steal it. When Senator Mabby and Iris show up to make another offer, the three gangsters hide in the next room. With a gun secretly pointed at him, Lambert is forced to insist on a price of $150,000. The senator refuses, and Iris is disillusioned. After the Mabbys leave, Hymie assigns Dimples to keep an eye on Lambert. The next day, Lambert receives a telegram, bearing an Iowa museum's bid of $5000. Lambert manages to knock Dimples out and steal a linoleum truck to transport the artwork to the museum's representatives. However, Hymie and Slug return before he can load it. They tie him up and drive to the buyers, unaware that Lambert has outsmarted them (what they think is the covered statue is actually an unconscious Dimples). When Parsons brings the police, looking for his truck, Lambert leads them to the thieves. The crooks are captured, and an impressed Parsons gives Lambert his job back. When Violet and her mother also show up, an emboldened Lambert tells them he is not going to marry Violet. With the $5000 check in hand, he proposes to Iris instead; she cannot say no.

It is part of a larger complex of buildings constructed for the pearl merchant Abdullah bin Isa Siyadi, which further includes a mosque and a majlis. While the Siyadi House was built under Ahmad bin Jassim Siyadi, the construction of the Siyadi Majlis was initiated by Ahmad bin Jassim Siyadi and the Siyadi Mosque was a shared initiative of Isa and Jassim bin Ahmad Siyadi.Ministry of Culture and Information: Pearling, Testimony of an island economy, 2010, p. 156 It is also a part of the Bahrain pearling trail, the second UNESCO World Heritage Site in the country. History The Siyadi family arrived to Bahrain in the early 19th century and settled close to the rulers‚Äô houses in the Sh. Abdallah neighbourhood. The family's wealth originated from their involvement in the pearl trade, which blossomed in Muharraq in the 19th century.Ministry of Culture and Information: Pearling, Testimony of an island economy, 2010, p. 158 Architecture The oldest part of the complex is Siyadi Mosque, which Isa and Jassim bin Yousif Siyadi donated to the Muharraq community in 1865. The original building was later revised and, according to Yarwood, the preserved structure dates to 1910.John Yarwood: Al-Muharraq: Architectural Heritage of a Bahraini City, 2005 the Siyadi Mosque is the oldest preserved mosque in Muharraq and is still used for daily prayers. Siyadi Majlis was constructed in two phases; the first phase initiated by Jassim bin Yousif Siyadi in 1850, which covered the ground floor and the upper-storey rooms constructed during the second phase in 1921. The largest part of the complex, Siyadi House is still used as a private residence and is inhabited by Abdallah bin Hassan Siyadi, the grandson of the builder Abdallah bin Isa Siyadi. It is not open to accessible to public and cannot be visited. The 450 square meters residence was the last construction and is dated to 1931. The three buildings illustrate elaborate decorations of the late pearling era of Bahrain, in particular Siyadi Majlis has an inside room worth visiting.John Falagan: We're all men here, 2007, p. 294 At present the Siyadi Majlis is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Culture, Bahrain.

The battle was fought at Brakfontein Drift near the Elands River between a force of 2,000 to 3,000 Boers and a garrison of 500 Australian, Rhodesian, Canadian and British soldiers, who were stationed there to protect a British supply dump that had been established along the route between Mafeking and Pretoria. The Boer force, which consisted of several commandos under the overall leadership of Koos de la Rey, were in desperate need of provisions after earlier fighting had cut them off from their support base. As a result, they decided to attack the garrison along the Elands River in an effort to capture the supplies located there. Over the course of 13 days, the Elands River supply dump was heavily shelled from several artillery pieces that were set up around the position, while Boers equipped with small arms and machine guns surrounded the garrison and kept the defenders under fire. Outnumbered and isolated, the defenders were asked to surrender by the Boer commander, but refused. The siege was subsequently lifted when the garrison was relieved by a 10,000-strong flying column led by Lord Kitchener. The relief effort, although successful, drew forces away from efforts to capture a Boer commander, Christiaan de Wet, who ultimately managed to evade British capture. This, along with the difficulty the British had in effecting the relief, buoyed Boer morale although the defenders' efforts also drew praise from Boer commanders. Background The first months of the Second Boer War were characterised by the use of large-scale conventional infantry forces by the British, which suffered heavy casualties in engagements with highly mobile Boer forces. Following this, a series of British counter-offensives, including mounted infantry units from the Australian colonies and Canada, among others, managed to capture and secure the main population centres in South Africa by June 1900. Much of the Boer force surrendered with the loss of their supply bases. In response, the Boers, including many who dishonoured their parole after having surrendered, and others who had melted away into civilian life, began a guerrilla warfare campaign. Operating in small groups, Boer commandos attacked columns of troops and supply lines, sniping, ambushing and launching raids on isolated garrisons and supply depots. As a defensive measure to protect the supply route between Mafeking and Pretoria, the British had established a garrison along the Elands River. Positioned near Brakfontein Drift, about west of Pretoria,. the location was developed into a supply dump by the British to supply forces operating in the area and to serve as a way point on the route between Rustenburg and Zeerust.. By mid-1900, the supplies that were located at Elands River included between 1,500 and 1,750 horses, mules and cattle, a quantity of ammunition, food and other equipment worth over 100,000 pounds, and over 100 wagons.. As the supplies were vulnerable to Boer raids, a garrison, spread across several positions, had been established.. The main position was at a farm located about away from the river, occupying a small ridge, while two smaller positions were established on hills to the south, closer to the river, which were later called Zouch's Kopje and Butters' Kopje. The area was bracketed by two creeks ‚Äì the Brakspruit to the north and the Doornspruit to the south ‚Äì which flowed west into the river. A telegraph line ran through the farm along the Zeerust‚ÄìRustenburg road, which crossed the river at a ford about west of the farm.. While the ground to the north, south and west of the supply dump dropped to the river where the Reit Valley opened towards Zeerust, away, the ground to the east of the farm rose towards a high point which came to be known as Cossack Post Hill. The hill was used by the garrison defending the post to send messages to Rustenburg ‚Äì away ‚Äì using a heliograph.. Prelude On 3 August, an 80-wagon supply convoy arrived at Elands River from Zeerust, where they were to wait for their escort, a column of 1,000 men from the New South Wales Imperial Bushmen along with South African irregulars, commanded by General Frederick Carrington, to arrive from Mafeking. Desperate for provisions, Boer forces decided to attack the garrison with a view to securing the supplies located there. Prior to the battle, the garrison had received intelligence warning them of the attack. As a result, some actions were taken to fortify the position, with a makeshift defensive perimeter being established utilising stores and wagons to create barricades. Little attempt had been made to dig-in, as the ground around the position was hard and the garrison lacked entrenching tools.. alt=Black and white portrait of a middle-aged man with a beard and hat The garrison defending the Elands River post consisted of about 500 men. The majority were Australians, comprising 105 from A Squadron of the New South Wales Citizen Bushmen, 141 from the Queensland Citizen Bushmen, 42 Victorians and nine Western Australians from the 3rd Bushmen Regiment, and two from Tasmania. In addition, there were 201 Rhodesians from the British South Africa Police, the Rhodesia Regiment, the Southern Rhodesian Volunteers, and the Bechuanaland Protectorate Regiment, along with three Canadians and three Britons. A British officer, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Hore, was in overall command. Their only fire support was one or two Maxim machine-guns and an antiquated 7-pounder screw gun, for which there was only about 100 rounds of ammunition. In addition to the garrison, there were civilians, consisting of Africans working as porters, drivers, or runners and about 30 loyalist European settlers who had moved to the farm prior to being evacuated. Against this, the Boer force, consisting of between 2,000 and 3,000 men drawn from the Rustenburg, Wolmaransstad and Marico commandos, under the overall command of Generals Koos de la Rey and Hermanus Lemmer, possessed five or six 12-pounder field guns for indirect fire, three quick-firing 1-pound pom-poms, which could provide rapid direct fire support, and two machine guns. Battle The Boer surrounded the garrison during the night while the latter were occupied singing around their campfires, and began their attack early on 4 August after the garrison had been stood down for breakfast. Rifle shots from snipers positioned in the riverbed announced the commencement of the attack. They were followed by an intense artillery barrage from the Boer guns. One pom-pom and a 12-pounder engaged one of the outposts from the south-west from behind an entrenched position about away on the opposite side of the river, while the main position was engaged by three guns positioned to the east along with a Maxim gun, snipers, a pom-pom and an artillery piece in multiple positions to the north- west about away. A third firing point, about away, consisting of an artillery piece and a pom-pom, engaged the garrison from high ground overlooking the river to the west.. In response, the defenders' screw gun returned fire, destroying a farmhouse from which Boers were firing; however, the gun soon jammed.. Unanswered, the Boer barrage of around 1,700 shells devastated the oxen and killed around 1,500 horses, mules and cattle. Those that remained alive were set free to avoid a stampede. In addition, the telegraph line and considerable stores were destroyed, and a number of casualties inflicted. In an effort to silence the guns, a small party of Queenslanders under Lieutenant James Annat, sallied to attack one of the Boer pom-pom positions, forcing its crew to pack up their weapon and withdraw. Nevertheless, the other guns remained in action and the barrage continued throughout the day, before easing as night fell. The defenders then used the brief respite to begin digging in, using their bayonets, and to clear away the dead animals. Casualties during the first day amounted to at least 28, of which eight were killed. alt=Colour map with military symbols depicting the location of various weapons and military units, and their movement The following morning, 5 August, the Boer gunners continued the shelling, but the effects were limited by the defences dug the night before. About 800 shells were fired on the second day, bringing the total to 2,500 over two days. Later that day, the expected 1000 strong column led by Carrington was ambushed by a Boer force under Lemmer's command about west of the position and, although their casualties consisted of only 17 wounded, Carrington chose to withdraw. The ambush was facilitated by the inadequate reconnaissance provided by Carrington's scouts. The column later destroyed supplies at Groot Marico, Zeerust and Ottoshoop, so that they would not fall into Boer hands, although a large amount of supplies remained usable in many locations, including at Zeerust, and were ultimately captured by the Boers. Carrington's force then withdrew hastily to Mafeking, a decision which damaged his reputation amongst some of his soldiers, particularly the Australians. When it became apparent that the relief had been turned back, the Boer commander, De la Rey, seeking to end the siege before another relief force could be sent,. ordered his men to cease fire and sent a messenger calling upon the garrison to surrender. After the garrison rejected the offer, the shelling resumed and continued throughout the night. Nevertheless, the defenders continued to improve their position, constructing stone sangars and digging their fighting pits deeper, reinforcing them with crates, sacks and wagon wheels. Wood, salvaged from wrecked wagons, was used to provide overhead protection to the positions, several of which were linked with a tunnel. A kitchen was also established, and a makeshift hospital built in the centre of the position using several ambulances and reinforced with wagons filled with dirt and various stores and containers. Although the defenders had repaired their screw gun, they were only able to use it for counter-battery fire sparingly due to lack of ammunition.. alt=A makeshift rock wall After the initial heavy barrage, on the third day of the siege the Boer gunners eased their rate of fire when it became apparent that they were destroying some of the supplies they were trying to capture. Nevertheless, the Boers maintained small arms fire, keeping defenders trapped in their defences during the intense heat of the day; the heat also accelerated the decomposition of the dead animals, the smell of which was considerable. There was no water source within the main camp so patrols under a Rhodesian officer, Captain Sandy Butters, who commanded the southernmost outpost at Butters' Kopje, were sent out at night to collect it from the Elands River, about away. During several of these sallies, fire was exchanged and the party had to fight their way back. De la Rey opted not to launch a direct assault on the position to limit his losses. The southern and eastern sides were well protected, but he realised that an approach from the south-west might offer more chance of success. Attempts were made by the Boers to take the kopje to the south of the Doornspruit on two nights ‚Äì 6 and 7 August in an effort to cut off the defenders' supply of water; however, Rhodesians, under the command of Butters, helped by supporting fire from the Zouch's Kopje near the creek's confluence with the river, repulsed both attacks. A force of 2,000 Boers took part in these efforts, and on the second night attempted to cover their approach by advancing behind a herd of sheep and goats. On 8 August, the post's hospital came under artillery fire, even though it was marked with a Red Cross flag. One of the shells struck it, further wounding some of those receiving treatment. After five days, De la Rey again called for surrender, as he became concerned about being caught by relief forces. The message was received by Hore around 9:00 am on the fifth day of the siege after several hours of artillery fire. Hore had been suffering from malaria even before the siege and had been largely confined to the post. As a result, command had effectively passed to an Australian, Major Walter Tunbridge from the Queensland Citizen Bushmen. Upon receiving the message, Hore discussed it with the other officers, at which point Tunbridge told him that the Australians refused to surrender. In order to demonstrate the respect with which he held the defence that the garrison had put up, De la Rey offered them safe passage to British lines and was even prepared to allow the officers to retain their revolvers so that they could leave the battlefield with dignity. Once again, however, the offer was rejected,. and Hore is reputed to have stated: \\"I cannot surrender. I am in command of Australians who would cut my throat if I did.\\" Butters took a similar line, repeatedly shouting towards the Boers that \\"Rhodesians never surrender!\\". As the fighting continued, the British made a second attempt to relieve the garrison, dispatching a force of about 1,000 men under Colonel Robert Baden-Powell from Rustenburg on 6 August. He halted just from Rustenburg, around the Selous River, about a third of the way, and sent out scouts. Failing to allow a proper reconnaissance, around midday Baden-Powell messaged General Ian Hamilton and turned back, determining the relief effort pointless, citing previous instructions and warnings from Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in South Africa Lord Roberts about becoming isolated, and claiming to have heard gun fire moving westward that suggested the garrison may have been evacuated to the west by Carrington. Based on the reports provided by Carrington upon his return, the British commanders in Pretoria and Mafeking were under the impression that the garrison had surrendered and, as a result, when Baden-Powell's force was about away from the besieged Elands River garrison at Brakfontein, Lord Roberts ordered him and the rest of Hamilton's force at Rustenburg to return to Pretoria, to focus on capturing Christiaan De Wet, an important Boer commander. Late on 6 August, Roberts learned that Carrington had failed to evacuate the Elands River garrison; in response Roberts ordered Carrington to try again. The siege continued; however, the size of the Boer force surrounding the garrison dwindled as their attention was drawn to attacks on nearby farms by members of the Kgatla tribe,. who were in revolt against the Boers following a series of tenant disputes. The ammunition situation was also concerning de la Rey and, as it became clear that the garrison would continue to hold out, he withdrew his artillery before superior numbers of British troops arrived. Ultimately, only about 200 men from the Wolmaransstad commando remained. As a result, the Boer weight of fire decreased and finally ceased altogether.. In response, the defenders sent patrols out to scout the Boer positions and small raiding parties were also sent out at night. These raids failed to confirm that the Boers were retreating and as a result, instead of seizing the initiative the defenders remained largely in their defences, thinking that the Boers were attempting a ruse to draw them out. On 13 August, the British commanders learned that the garrison was still holding out when they intercepted a message between Boer commanders via a runner. Two days later, 10,000 men under the command of Lord Kitchener, set out towards Elands River. As they approached, de la Rey, faced by a superior force, withdrew what remained of his force. Small arms fire around the perimeter ceased on 15 August and the garrison observed rising dust from the withdrawal. That evening, a message was sent to Hore by four Western Australians from a force under Beauvoir de Lisle, and Kitchener's column arrived the following day, on 16 August. Carrington's relief force from Mafeking, having been ordered to make a second attempt by Roberts, backtracked very slowly and ultimately arrived after the siege had been lifted. Aftermath alt=A grave site marked with white rocks and two headstones, in front of a low rock wall Casualties for the defenders amounted to 12 soldiers killed and 36 wounded. In addition, four African porters were killed and 14 wounded, and one loyalist European settler was wounded.. Most of the wounded were evacuated to Johannesburg. The loss of animals was heavy, with only 210 left alive out of 1,750. Of the 12 soldiers who were killed, eight were Australians.. During the siege, defenders who had been killed were hastily buried under the cover of darkness in a temporary cemetery. At the conclusion of the fighting, the graves were improved with several slate headstones and white rocks to mark the outlines, and a formal funeral was provided. After the war, the dead were exhumed and reburied at Swartruggens Cemetery, with individual crosses replacing the group slate headstones. One of the original slate headstones was brought back to Australia in the 1970s and placed on display in the Australian War Memorial. Although the behaviour of the defending troops was not beyond reproach, with some becoming drunk during the siege, the commander of the relieving force, Lord Kitchener, told the garrison upon his arrival that their defence had been \\"remarkable\\" and that only \\" ... Colonials could have held out in such impossible circumstances\\". The garrison's performance was also later lauded by Jan Smuts, who was at the time a senior Boer commander, describing the defenders as \\" ... heroes who in the hour of trial ...[had risen]... nobly to the occasion\\". The battle has been described by historian Chris Coulthard-Clark as being \\" ... perhaps the most notable action involving Australians in South Africa\\". The writer, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who served in a British field hospital at Bloemfontein during 1900 and who later published a series of accounts of the conflict, also highlighted the significance of the battle in The Great Boer War. The flag flown by the garrison during the siege was later displayed in the Cathedral of St Mary and All Saints in Salisbury, Rhodesia. For their actions during the siege, the Rhodesian commander, Butters, and Captain Albert Duka, a medical officer from Queensland, were invested with the Distinguished Service Order. Three soldiers ‚Äì Corporal Robert Davenport and Troopers Thomas Borlaise and William Hunt ‚Äì received the Distinguished Conduct Medal. Borlaise, who had been a miner before enlisting, received his medal for the role he had played in improving the position's defences,. while Davenport received the award for rescuing two wounded men under fire. Conversely, Carrington continued nominal command of the Rhodesian Field Force, which became a paper formation, and was sent back to England by the end of the year. The battle had strategic implications. The difficulty the British had in relieving the garrison served to boost Boer morale, which had been flagging due to earlier reverses, while the act of doing so drew forces away from the cordon that was being set up by the British to capture De Wet, who subsequently managed to escape through the Magaliesberg, which had been abandoned by Baden-Powell during the relief effort. This ultimately prolonged the war, which would continue for almost another two years. Over a year after the siege, on 17 September 1901, another battle was fought along a different Elands River at Modderfontein farm in the then Cape Colony,. where a Boer force under Smuts and Deneys Reitz overwhelmed a detachment of the 17th Lancers and raided their camp for supplies..

Early life and education  McGurk was born and raised in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, just north of Philadelphia. He attended Notre Dame High School in Lawrenceville, NJ, received his undergraduate from Kutztown University, and his master's degree from St. Joseph's University. His first real love for music began in 1986, when at the age of six he took his sisters Beastie Boys ‚ÄúLicensed to Ill‚Äù tape and listened to repeatedly. He emulated their style and started to rap as a hobby, which later became his passion and launched his career in music.  Career  After graduating college in 2002, McGurk moved from Philadelphia to New Orleans accepting a job offer as a talent scout for Trans Continental Records, a Lou Pearlman company. After about a year of working in New Orleans, he realized his special talents for discovering and developing artists and moved back to Philadelphia. In 2003, he discovered and managed, hip-hop artist Asher Roth, who would later go on to sell over 2 million records of his hit single, ‚ÄúI love college‚Äù. Asher Roth released 2 CD‚Äôs while under McGurk.Matthew as an Executive Producer in Believe the Hype - Asher Roth His first E.P. called ‚ÄúJust Listen‚Äù, and a mix tape called ‚ÄúBelieve The Hype‚Äù. With the success of Asher Roth, McGurk became only the third person in music history to have discovered a solo white rapper who sold a million or more records of their debut hit single, succeeding only Dr. Dre and Eminem. McGurk and Roth later decided to go their separate ways and end their business relationship. Asher Roth went on to sign with talent manager Scooter Braun, who also manages Justin Bieber. McGurk then went on to discover and produce a pop girl group. After two years of recording and development, he decided to dismantle the group in support of their individual pursuits for solo careers. This led to major record deals for 2 out of the 3 girls. Around this time McGurk worked with and was mentored by Multi-Grammy winning Producer Vidal Davis, who produced hit records for Usher, Chris Brown, Alicia Keys, and many more. In 2009, McGurk decided to take a break from music to answer the call of duty and serve his country as a United States Army Officer. He earned the rank of 1LT and served as an Infantry Platoon Leader in the 172nd Infantry Brigade. During this time he led a platoon mostly compiled of Army Rangers and was the officer in charge of the Battalion and Company Intelligence Support teams. After being injured in the line of duty, he was retired from Active Duty in 2013. McGurk was awarded the Army Meritorious Service Medal and 3 Army Commendation Medals for his service. After his retirement from the Army, McGurk moved to Los Angeles. In 2014, his team consisting of Markus Schulz and Daniel Kier, co-wrote 7 records with now megastar Meghan Trainor.

Theory The coupling of the two oscillators, photons modes in the semiconductor optical microcavity and excitons of the quantum wells, results in the energy anticrossing of the bare oscillators, giving rise to the two new normal modes for the system, known as the upper and lower polariton resonances (or branches). The energy shift is proportional to the coupling strength (dependent, e.g., on the field and polarization overlaps). The higher energy or upper mode (UPB, upper polariton branch) is characterized by the photonic and exciton fields oscillating in-phase, while the LPB (lower polariton branch) mode is characterized by them oscillating with phase-opposition. Microcavity exciton-polaritons inherit some properties from both of their roots, such as a light effective mass (from the photons) and a capacity to interact with each other (from the strong exciton nonlinearities) and with the environment (including the internal phonons, which provide thermalization, and the outcoupling by radiative losses). In most cases the interactions are repulsive, at least between polariton quasi-particles of the same spin type (intra-spin interactions) and the nonlinearity term is positive (increase of total energy, or blueshift, upon increasing density). Recently, researchers measured the long-range transport in organic materials coupled to optical micro-cavities and showed that exciton-polaritons propagate over several microns. Other features Polaritons are also characterized by non-parabolic energy-momentum dispersion relations, which limit the validity of the parabolic effective-mass approximation to a small range of momenta . They also have a spin degree-of-freedom, making them spinorial fluids able to sustain different polarization textures. Exciton-polaritons are composite bosons which can be observed to form Bose-Einstein condensates, and sustain polariton superfluidity and quantum vortices and are prospected for emerging technological applications. Many experimental works currently focus on polariton lasers, optically addressed transistors, nonlinear states such as solitons and shock waves, long-range coherence properties and phase transitions, quantum vortices and spinorial patterns. Modelization of exciton- polariton fluids mainly rely on the use of GPE (Gross‚ÄìPitaevskii equations) which are in the form of nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equations.

Miller Junior High and High School, is a school building located at 2322 DuBois Street in Detroit, Michigan. It served as a high school from 1933 to 1957, and was significant as the de facto high school serving African American students in Detroit. It was designated a state of Michigan Historic Site in 1986 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. History Detroit experienced a phenomenal increase in population of almost 700,000 people during the 1910s. To accommodate the influx of residents and their children, numerous schools were built during the decade. Ground was broken for what was then called the \\"Dubois School\\" in 1918; the school was intended to serve as a junior high. The school was designed by the architectural firm of Malcomson and Higginbotham, the architects of nearly all Detroit Public Schools in the period 1894 to 1923, and constructed at a cost on $245,616. In 1919, the still unfinished building was renamed the \\"Sidney D. Miller Intermediate School\\". Sidney D. Miller (1830‚Äì1904) was a former president of the Detroit Board of Education, as well as of the Detroit Health Commission and Police Commission. However, construction plans were changed several times, and the school was not opened to students until 1921. The building itself was finally completed in 1922. During the 1920s, the city's population continued to grow, stretching the capacity of the school system. An addition to Miller, including a girl's gymnasium, was completed in 1931. Although the area around the school was predominantly white when the building opened, the percentage of African Americans in the Black Bottom neighborhood increased so that soon it was predominantly black. Parents of white students at nearby Eastern High School complained about the rising Black student population, and in response the Detroit School Board converted Miller to a senior high school in 1933. A liberal school transfer policy allowed white students zoned to Miller to attend Eastern, which left Miller as the de facto, if not de jure, African- American High school. The school is significant in part because of its association with the education of African American students, beginning in 1933. From 1933 to 1957, it served as the main, but unofficial, secondary school for black students. Due in part to concerns from the black community, the School Board installed a number of Black teachers and administrators at Miller. However, in 1955, steps were taken to end the de facto segregation of the Detroit School system, and in 1957 the building was converted back into a middle school. It remained a middle school for 50 years and was closed in 2007. Athletics Miller High School met Detroit St. Joseph High School in 1947 at Detroit's Olympia Stadium in what became the first City Basketball Championship game in Detroit PSL and Catholic High School League history. Miller won that game 47 to 34 before a Michigan high school record attendance of 11,563. Description The Miller School is a 2-1/2 story Jacobethan building with a flat roof, built of red brick with limestone beltcourses. The front (west) and rear fa√ßades are asymmetrical, with three-story projecting bays. The entrance is through a Gothic arch flanked by piers; the words \\"SYDNEY D.

The 4404th Wing (Provisional) is an inactive United States Air Force unit. It was last was assigned to the Air Combat Command (ACC), stationed at Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia. The mission of the 4404th Wing (Provisional) was to serve as the front line defense against possible Iraqi aggression after the 1991 Gulf War. It enforced United Nations Security Council Resolutions 687, 688, and 949 and protected United States military forces stationed in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The wing was inactivated on 1 October 1998. History Established by Tactical Air Command at Prince Sultan Air Base, Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia, to partially replace provisional air divisions established during the 1991 Gulf War. The original assets of the 4404th TFW came from the 4th TFW (Provisional), which had operated during the Gulf War. In June 1991 the wing relocated to King Abdul Aziz Air Base, Dahran, where it was officially activated as the 4404th Wing (Provisional) on 2 August 1991. From the start of Operation Southern Watch, the Wing was structured and manned to carry out a temporary mission, insuring that Iraq complied with the post-Operation Desert Storm United Nations sanctions. It later was engaged in (Operation Provide Comfort, and later Operation Northern Watch were commanded by the US European Command (EUCOM)). The 4404th consisted of six provisional groups assigned at nine locations in the Persian Gulf region, including Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. During the 1990s and early 2000s, more than 5,000 airmen made up the wing, manned primarily by airmen who rotated to Saudi Arabia on temporary duty assignments. During Operation Vigilant Warrior, the number of personnel peaked at about 7000. However, the wing was manned at minimum levels. This policy was intended to reduce the visibility of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, limit exposure to risk, reduce the impact on Air Force units worldwide from whom the airmen were assigned, and insure that they were fully committed during their short tours of duty. This manning provided little flexibility to respond to changes in threat or mission requirements. Air Force flying squadrons were assigned as units to the 4404th Operations Group (Provisional) on 15-, 30-, 45-, 60-, and 90-day rotations depending on the type unit. Air Expeditionary Force III forces that deployed to Qatar from July through August 1996 were under the operational control of the 4404th Wing (Provisional), under the tactical control of either the Commander, Joint Task Force-Southwest Asia or the Commander, Joint Task Force-Rugged Nautilus, but for force protection were under U.S. Liaison Office, Qatar which does not have the command authority to direct force protection actions. After a terrorist truck bomb killed 19 airmen at Dhahran in June 1996 (Khobar Towers bombing), the wing was ordered to move to more secure location within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. As a result, it was moved back to Prince Sultan Air Base. It was inactivated and re-designated as the 363d Air Expeditionary Wing on 1 October 1998 as part of the implementation of the Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept.

The full title was Aj Kan Ek º or Ajaw Kan Ek º , and in some studies Kan Ek º is used as the name of the Late Postclassic (c. 1200 to 1697) Pet√©n Itza polity.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 616. The earliest known use of the title comes from a Maya stela at the archaeological site of Yaxchilan and dates to the mid 8th century AD. The name is recorded in inscriptions at widely spaced Maya cities including Seibal, Motul de San Jos√© and Chichen Itza. When Spanish conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s crossed Pet√©n in the early 16th century, he met with an Itza king identified by the name Kan Ek º. The Itza were not contacted again until the early 17th century when Franciscan friars were initially welcomed by the current Aj Kan Ek º before being expelled. This was followed by several incidents in which attempts to interact with the Itza resulted in the slaughter of the Spanish and their Maya converts, resulting in a long lull before attempts were resumed with a new Kan Ek º in the closing years of the 17th century. These culminated in a bloody battle, after which the last Kan Ek º was captured; he spent the rest of his life under arrest in the colonial capital of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Etymology The two elements in the Kan Ek º name represent surnames taken from the mother's and father's lineage respectively. In Pet√©n during the Postclassic period a person belonged to two lineage groups. The individual's ch ºibal group was determined by their father's lineage and their tz ºakab group was determined by their mother's lineage group. Individuals simultaneously inherited their surname and property from the father's lineage group and a surname, titles and religious leanings from the lineage group of their mother. Maya rulers were members of royal lineage groups and the kan element of the king's name was inherited from the royal tz ºakab while the Ek º' element was derived from the royal ch ºibal  º. Due to this, all the Itza kings of Pet√©n bore the name Kan Ek º.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.693. Among the Itza, kan ek º meant \\"serpent star\\"; it may also have had a secondary meaning of \\"sky star\\" (ka ºan ek º ).Jones 1998, p. 80. Polity At the time of the Spanish conquest of Pet√©n in 1697, the Kan Ek º kingdom was one of the three dominant polities in the central Pet√©n Basin.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 617. History The Kan Ek º name is recorded in the hieroglyphic text on Seibal Stela 11 The Kan Ek º name is recorded as being used by a king of Motul de San Jos√©, just north of Lake Pet√©n Itz√°,Foias 2000, p.773. as far back as the Late Classic period (c. AD 600-900) of Mesoamerican chronology.Vel√°squez Garc√≠a 2007, p.31 Kan Ek º is mentioned in a hieroglyphic text dated to AD 766 upon Stela 10 at Yaxchilan on the west bank of the Usumacinta River. At Seibal, on the Pasi√≥n River, Stela 10, dating to 849 AD, has an inscription naming Kan Ek º as ruler of Motul de San Jos√©, which is recorded as being one of the four paramount polities in the mid-9th century, along with Calakmul, Tikal and Seibal itself.Martin & Grube 2000, pp. 18, 227. Foias 2003, p.19. The name is also recorded on Seibal Stela 11, erected at the same time as Stela 10; it is additionally contained within inscriptions at the Great Ballcourt of Chichen Itza in Yucat√°n,Rice 2009, p. 41. which date to the Late Classic period.Hofling 2009, p. 71. Early 16th century In 1525, after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hern√°n Cort√©s led an expedition to Honduras over land, cutting across the Itza kingdom en route.Jones 2000, p. 358. His aim was to subdue the rebellious Crist√≥bal de Olid, whom he had sent to conquer Honduras, but Crist√≥bal de Olid had set himself up independently on his arrival in that territory.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 761. Cort√©s arrived at the north shore of Lake Pet√©n Itz√° on 13 March 1525; he was met there by the Aj Kan Ek º.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 761‚Äì762. The Roman Catholic priests accompanying the expedition celebrated mass in the presence of Kan Ek º, who was said to be so impressed that he pledged to worship the Cross and to destroy his idols.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 762. Cort√©s accepted an invitation from the king to visit Nojpet√©n, and crossed to the Maya city with a small contingent of Spanish soldiers while the rest of his army continued around the lake to meet him on the south shore.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 762. Jones 2000, p. 358. Cort√©s left behind a lame horse that the Itza treated as a deity, attempting to feed it poultry, meat and flowers but the animal soon died. Early 17th century Following Cort√©s' visit, no Spanish attempted to visit the warlike Itza inhabitants of Nojpet√©n for almost a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan friars set out from M√©rida in Yucat√°n on a mission to attempt the peaceful conversion of the still pagan Itza in central Pet√©n. Bartolom√© de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were accompanied by the alcalde of Bacalar (a Spanish colonial official) and some Christianised Maya. After an arduous six-month journey the travellers were well received by the current Kan Ek º. They stayed at Nojpet√©n for some days in an attempt to evangelise the Itza but the Aj Kan Ek º refused to renounce his Maya religion, although he showed interest in the masses held by the Catholic missionaries. Kan Ek º informed them that according to ancient Itza prophecy it was not yet time for them to convert to Christianity. In the time since Cort√©s had visited Nojpet√©n, the Itza had made a statue of the deified horse. Juan de Orbita was outraged when he saw the idol and he immediately smashed it into pieces. Fuensalida was able to save the lives of the visitors from the infuriated natives by means of a particularly eloquent sermon that resulted in them being forgiven. Attempts to convert the Itza failed and the friars left Nojpet√©n on friendly terms with Kan Ek º.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 773. The friars returned in 1619, arriving in October and staying for eighteen days. Again Kan Ek º welcomed them in a friendly manner; however the Maya priesthood were hostile and jealous of the missionaries' influence upon the king. They persuaded Kan Ek's wife to convince him to expel the unwelcome visitors. The missionaries' lodgings were surrounded by armed warriors and the friars and their accompanying servants were escorted to a waiting canoe and instructed to leave and never come back. Juan de Orbita attempted to resist and was rendered unconscious by an Itza warrior. The missionaries were expelled without food or water but survived the journey back to M√©rida.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774. Interlude In 1622 Captain Francisco de Mirones set out from Yucat√°n to launch an assault upon the Itza. His army was later joined by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado. En route to Nojpet√©n, Delgado believed that the army's treatment of the Maya was excessively cruel and he left the army to make his own way to Nojpet√©n with eighty Christianised Maya from Tipu. When the party arrived at Nojpet√©n, they were all seized and sacrificed to the Maya gods. Soon afterwards, the Itza caught Mirones and his soldiers off guard and unarmed in the church at Sacalum; they were slaughtered to a man. These events ended all Spanish attempts to contact the Itza until 1695. Late 17th century In 1695 the governor of Yucat√°n, Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a y Arizmendi, began to build a road from Campeche south towards Pet√©n. Franciscan Andr√©s de Avenda√±o followed the new road as far as possible then continued towards Nojpet√©n with local Maya guides.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 774-775. They arrived at the western end of Lake Pet√©n Itz√° to an enthusiastic welcome by the local Itza. The following day, the current Aj Kan Ek º travelled across the lake with eighty canoes to greet the visitors. The Franciscans returned to Nojpet√©n with Kan Ek º and baptised over 300 Itza children over the following four days. Avenda√±o tried to convince Kan Ek º to convert to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish crown, without success. The king of the Itza, like his forebear, cited Itza prophecy and said the time was not yet right. He asked the Spanish to return in four months, at which time the Itza would convert and swear fealty to the King of Spain. Kan Ek º learnt of a plot by a rival Itza group to ambush and kill the Franciscans and the Itza king advised them to return to M√©rida via Tipu.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 775. The Spanish friars became lost and suffered great hardships but eventually arrived back in M√©rida after a month travelling.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 775-776. Kan Ek º sent emissaries to M√©rida in December 1695 to inform Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a that the Itza would peacefully submit to Spanish rule. A Spanish party led by Captain Pedro de Zubiaur arrived at Lake Pet√©n Itza with 60 soldiers, friar San Buenaventura and allied Yucatec Maya warriors. Although they expected a peaceful welcome they were immediately attacked by approximately 2000 Maya warriors. San Buenaventura and one of his Franciscan companions, a Spanish soldier and a number of Yucatec Maya warriors were taken prisoner. Spanish reinforcements arrived the next day but were beaten back. This turn of events convinced Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a that Kan Ek º would not surrender peacefully and he began to organise an all-out assault on Nojpet√©n.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 776. Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a arrived at the lakeshore with a Spanish army on 1 March 1697 and built a fortified camp and an attack boat. On 10 March Kan Ek º sent a canoe with a white flag raised bearing emissaries, including the Itza high priest, who offered peaceful surrender. Urs√∫a received the embassy in peace and invited Kan Ek º to visit his encampment three days later. On the appointed day Kan Ek º failed to arrive; instead Maya warriors amassed both along the shore and in canoes upon the lake. Urs√∫a decided that any further attempts at peaceful incorporation of the Itza into the Spanish Empire were pointless and a waterbourne assault was launched upon Kan Ek's capital on 13 March.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 777. The city fell after a brief but bloody battle in which many Itza warriors died; the Spanish suffered only minor casualties. The surviving Itza abandoned their capital and swam across to the mainland with many dying in the water.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 777-778. Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a planted his standard upon the highest point of the island and renamed Nojpet√©n as Nuestra Se√±ora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza (\\"Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza\\").Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 778. Jones 2009, p. 59. Kan Ek º was soon captured with help from the Yalain Maya ruler.Jones 1998, p. 206. Urs√∫a returned to M√©rida, leaving Kan Ek º and other high-ranking members of his family as prisoners of the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Se√±ora de los Remedios y San Pablo. Reinforcements arrived from Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (modern Antigua Guatemala) in 1699 but they did not stay long due to an outbreak of disease. When they returned to the Guatemalan capital they took Kan Ek º, his son and two of his cousins with them. The cousins died en route but the last Kan Ek º and his son spent the remainder of their lives under house arrest in the colonial capital.Jones 2009, p. 59.

After showing promise as a two-year-old in 1868 he improved to become a top class performer in the early part of the following year. He won the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket and The Derby. Pretender was the last horse trained in the North of England to win the Derby until Dante in 1945; no other has won since. He failed to complete the Triple Crown when he was beaten in the St Leger at Doncaster. Pretender‚Äôs form subsequently deteriorated and he failed to record any significant wins despite staying in training for two more seasons. He made no impression as a stallion. Background Pretender was a bay or brown horse standing 16 hands high bred by William Sadler of Doncaster and sold for 400 guineas as a yearling to the trainer Thomas Dawson, acting on behalf of John Johnstone. Johnstone remained the colt's official owner throughout his career but owned him jointly with Sir Robert Jardine. Pretender was sent into training with Dawson at his stables at Tupgill Park near Middleham, North Yorkshire. Pretender was from the first crop of foals sired by Adventurer, who won eight races and went on to become a successful stallion, taking the title of Champion sire in 1874. His dam, Ferina, who had previously produced the 2000 Guineas runner-up St. Hubert, was twenty-two years old when Pretender was foaled. After Pretender's birth she was barren and was shot in April 1869, shortly before Pretender's Classic successes. Racing career 1868: two- year-old season As a two-year-old Pretender ran four times and won twice. The more important of his wins came in the North of England Biennial Stakes at York, a race previously won by Blair Athol. He finished third in the Lambton Plate at Stockton-on-Tees Racecourse. In October, he was sent south for the Middle Park Plate at Newmarket, one of the season's most prestigious races for two-year-olds. He finished third in the ¬£1,000 race behind Pero Gomez and the future 1000 Guineas winner Scottish Queen. 1869: three-year-old season Robert Jardine, Pretender's joint-owner In early 1869, Pretender was \\"favourably regarded\\" as a Derby contender, along with Pero Gomez, Belladrum and Wild Oats. On his three-year-old debut on 27 April, Pretender started 3/1 favourite for the 2000 Guineas, a race for which Pero Gomez was not entered. Ridden by John Osborne he won by half a length from Belladrum. The riding of the runner-up was strongly criticised, with suggestions that some of the biggest bookmakers (the \\"leviathans\\") had been involved in his defeat. Pretender was made the 11/8 favourite for the Derby on 26 May in a field of twenty-two runners. The race attracted the customary large crowd including the Prince and Princess of Wales and foreign dignitaries such as the Nawab of Bengal and the Crown Prince of Denmark. Pretender raced prominently, just behind the pacemakers and turned into the straight in second place. Osborne sent the favourite to the front two furlongs from the finish, just as Pero Gomez was badly hampered in a collision with two other runners. In the final furlong, Pretender turned back a challenge from The Drummer, but was then pressed by John Wells on Pero Gomez who finished very strongly. On the line Pretender prevailed by a short head, although the result was in considerable doubt for several moments until the judge's verdict was announced, and Wells was convinced that he had won. The win was well received, partly on account of the popularity of Osborne, who was winning the race for the first time. After the Derby, Pero Gomez‚Äôs owner, Sir Joseph Hawley, attempted to lodge an objection on the grounds that Sadler, Pretender‚Äôs original owner, had died, making all the horse‚Äôs entries void. Sadler informed the authorities by telegram that he was alive and well, leading to some embarrassment on Hawley‚Äôs part. Pretender won the Great Northern ‚ÄúSt Leger‚Äù at Stockton in August, but was beginning to show symptoms of the respiratory condition known as Roarer Syndrome, which increasingly prevented him from exerting himself fully. In the St Leger on 15 September he started 5/6 favourite in a field of eleven runners despite rumours that he was not in good form. He was held up in the early stages but could make no progress in the straight and tired in the closing stages to finish fourth, six lengths behind Pero Gomez. In the one and a half mile Doncaster Stakes two days later he was ridden closer to the lead but was again beaten easily by Pero Gomez, finishing second by a length. In October he showed slightly better form to finish second, beaten a neck by the French outsider Boulogne, to whom he was conceding seven pounds in the Newmarket Derby. 1870-1871: later career Pretender stayed in training at four but his ‚Äúroaring‚Äù was becoming more serious and he failed to reproduce his best form. In July 1870 he finished unplaced as a 100/1 outsider in the Stewards' Cup at Goodwood. He ran at the St Leger meeting at Doncaster in September, finishing among the back markers in the Portland Handicap. At five, Pretender‚Äôs form deteriorated further. He ran three times at Goodwood in July, finishing unplaced in the Stewards' Cup, the Chichester Stakes and the Chesterfield Cup. Stud career Pretender retired to stand at the Fairfield Stud near York. He failed to attract many mares and was later moved to a stud at Sheffield Lane Paddocks where he stood at a fee of 40 guineas. He failed to produce any runners of consequence before his death in 1878. He was buried at Brecongill near Middleham, where a large stone still marks the spot.

A protest is a statement or action taken part to express disapproval of or object an authority; most commonly led in order to influence public opinion or government policy. They range from village food riots against imposed taxes to protests that initiated the Russian revolution. Some of women-led mass protests deliberately set out to emphasise the gender (or gender role) of the organisers and participants: for example, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo emphasised their common role as mothers by marching in white headscarves to symbolise the diapers of their lost children. In other settings, women may strip naked in order to draw attention to their cause, or to shame or intimidate those whom they are protesting. (p. 21) Boudica Boudica or Boudicca' (, ), also known as Boadicea (, also ) or Boudicea, and in Welsh as ' (), was a queen of the British Celtic Iceni tribe who led an uprising against the conquering forces of the Roman Empire in AD 60 or 61. She died shortly after its failure and was said to have poisoned herself. She is considered a British folk hero. Food riots E.P. Thompson's classic article \\"The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the 18th Century\\" emphasised women's role in many food riots. He argued that the rioters insisted on the idea of a moral community that was obliged to feed them and their families. As one contemporary commentator wrote: 'Women are more disposed to be mutinous ... [and] in all public tumults they are foremost in violence and ferocity.' E.P. Thompson, Customs in Common, p234. John Bohstedt later argued that Thompson had exaggerated women's role in food riots. Thompson responded by forcefully rejecting Bohstedt's criticism.E.P. Thompson, 'The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the 18th Century' and 'Moral Economy Reviewed' in Customs in Common, p185-335; Malcolm Thomis and Jennifer Grimmett, Women in Protest, 1800‚Äì1850, p28ff; John Bohstedt, 'The Myth of the Feminine Food Riot' in Harriet Applewhite and Darlene Levy, Women and Politics in the Age of Democratic Revolution. We will never know the exact proportion of women's involvement in 18th Century food riots, but it appears that, at the very least, women led or initiated a significant minority of such riots and they participated in many more. Women had participated more fully in food riots than they had in earlier anti-impressment riots of 1747, in which they defended community interest and enforced community morality. These riots of revolution and resistance opened up opportunities for women to take political action as social and economic influencers, and not just as a republican's wife or a mother.Smith, Barbara Clark. \\"Food Rioters and the American Revolution.\\" The William and Mary Quarterly, vol. 51, no. 1, 1994, pp. 3‚Äì38. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2947003. He indicates that women's new assertiveness had something to do with the weakening of the patriarchal control of women as feudalism declined and market relations expanded. Men and women participated in food riots in Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany (where contemporary reports claimed that women initiated many riots). Dutch tax riots in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were more numerous often more violent with participants of both lower and lower-middle classes, whereas food riots drew only lower class participants. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, at last 26 riots and 50 demonstrations involved women with 10 being chiefly under their control. Women did the cooking and purchased foodstuffs for their families; therefore, they were the first parties to be confronted with scarcities of food and high prices. In doing so women generally controlled much of the household finances. Another reason for their participation is due to the fact that food riots typically started in market places near shops and mills, which is where women gathered the most. One of the most prominent tax riots in 1616 has even gone on record as \\"the Women's Revolt of Delft\\".Dekker, Rudolf M. \\"Women in revolt.\\" Theory and Society 16.3 (1987): 337-362 Women also conducted nearly a third of food riots during the American Revolution William Sheehan, Riotous Assemblies, p160; Wouter Ronsijn, Western Europe's last food riots: a comparison of the market riots of the 1840s and 1850s in Flanders; H.Applewhite and D.Levy, Women and Politics in the Age of Democratic Revolution, 127-30; Manfred Gailus in K.Hagemann, Civil Society and Gender, p174-9; Barbara Clark Smith, 'Food Rioters and the American Revolution', William and Mary Quarterly, Vol. 51, No. 1, p3-5, 26-9. despite the fact that women were excluded from the vote, unqualified to serve as jurors at courts and law, and were essentially politically disabled by their dependent status. It made a difference that Americans knew that women figured prominently in food riots in England and Europe, and it made a difference that ideas of equity, neighborly dealing, and charity informed American women's daily lives in the colonial period. Roughly 100 women marched a \\"Female Riot\\" and took to the streets in July 1777 insisting on their right to enforce equitable exchange. Women made up most of the participants in (and organisers of) several food riots that broke out in North America during the early twentieth-century. Women continue to play a prominent role in many food riots - for example, in 2008 over 1,000 women protested the Peruvian government's response to rising food prices. Uprisings to demand women's suffrage During the early twentieth century, women's protests for the right to vote became particularly militant in Britain. Many of the core organisers of mass protests were women. Strategies used by protestors included mass demonstrations, arson, widespread window breaking and attempts to storm both Parliament and Buckingham Palace. After World War I broke out in 1914, the mainstream suffragette movement suspended its protests in order to focus on the war effort.Susan Kent, Gender and Power in Britain, 1640-1990, p262, 268-73; Women's Social and Political Union. French Revolutions Women were especially prominent in food riots in French marketplaces (although men dominated those in the countryside).Cynthia Bouton, 'Gendered Behavior in Subsistence Riots', Journal of Social History, Vol.23, No.4; C. Bouton, The Flour War: Gender, Class and Community in Late Ancien Regime French Society. The most momentous French food riot was The Women's March on Versailles. This occurred in October 1789, when the market women of Paris began calling the men 'cowards' and declaring: 'We will take over!' These women proceeded to march to Versailles with soldiers following them. This crowd then forced the King to return to Paris where, three years later, women were again major participants in the demonstrations that led to the abolition of the monarchy. As a police inspector said in 1793: 'It is mainly the women who are stirred up, women who in turn communicate all their frenzy to the men, heating them up with their seditious propositions and stimulating the most violent effervescence.'D. Garrioch, 'Everyday Lives of Parisian Women in the October Days, 1789', Social History, Vol.24, p231-2; H.Applewhite and D.Levy, Women and Politics in the Age of Democratic Revolution, p76, 81ff; Olwen Hufton, Women and the Limits of Citizenship in the French Revolution, p1-49; H.Applewhite and D.Levy, 'Women and Political Revolution in Paris', in Renate Bridenthal, Becoming Visible, Women in European History (1987 Edition), p285-300. Meanwhile, women in the countryside initiated 'counter-revolutionary' protests against the new government's policies of the repression of the Church and the conscription of male peasants into the army.James Mcmillan, France and Women, 1789-1914, p25-6; Wikipedia: War in the Vendee. During the French Revolution, women lead the fight for religion. Their fight would lead the way for the feminization of religions. Women felt that they were one responsible for maintaining a spiritual balance within their family. They fought harder than their male counterparts, invoking violent and illegal actions sometimes to get their voices heard. If women were ever arrested, the males in their lives would downplay the damage they could do and were also seen as more hysterical and vulnerable as a whole, so society never thought much of their violent and illegal actions. But if a woman refused or avoided taking part in petitions or marches, she would be shamed until guilted into taking part. The women during the French Revolution also fought for their own rights. Aristocratic women were not as likely to partake in the activities that could ruin their family and/or their chance of inheriting the family fortune (or what she would receive), so they were reluctant to participate. Working class women also faced this dilemma, but because they were already the suppressed class, the good of what they could achieve outweighed the loss of family pride and/or fortune. Louis XVI had allowed all people who paid taxes to vote, but since women could not pay taxes, they could not vote. While the Third Estate made rules, women would present their opinions through pamphlets and petitions to let the Third Estate know what they wanted. P√©tition des femmes du Tiers-Etat au Roi stated that women wanted education to go beyond French and Latin for Church, more jobs to be available to women, and to raise the max pay of 5-6 sous. Motion en Faveur du Sexe and Discours pr√©liminaire de la pauvre Javotte focused on dowries and marriage. In the working class, finding a job was hard enough for men, harder for women, and saving enough money to get married was almost impossible. Women didn't want to have to pay a dowry to get married, this applied only in the Third Estate. The Rights of Woman by Olympe de Gou was a complete pamphlet that stated all the rights that women should have. It was copied almost word for word from the Declaration of the Rights of Man, but applied to women. A booklet \\"Griefs et plaintes des femmes mal mari√©es\\" placed criticism on marriage laws oppressing women into submission to their male counterpart and demanded the legalization of divorce. In the sector of Bourgeoises, Madame Etta Palm van Aelder was a leading figure in fighting to women's rights. She demanded for the equal right to an education, political freedom, divorce and legality of women of age 21 and over. While political freedom would not be gained until after the Revolution, all other demands would be meet in some way. In August 1792, women of the age of 21 and above were given legal freedom from their parents. In September 1792, women were granted the right to divorce and the Law of 1794 eased the divorce process. Educational programs were advanced and allowed women to be trained for careers in the work field, but they still did not obtain equality. Female teachers were paid less than males and primary school classes were divided by gender. By the end of the advancements and improvements in the educational system, the women weren't much better off than before. R. B. Rose argues that despite the efforts of women during the Revolution, little changed. The Revolution was a revolution for the men, and a place of chaos for the women. The French Revolutionary Constitution of 1791 allowed women to be labeled as citizens, but nothing else than that. They still didn't have voting rights or the ability to run for office. The Napoleonic Law of 1804 suppressed wives into submission to their husbands, reversing all equality demands made during the Revolution. Women still couldn't own land because they couldn't legally sign any contract, putting the land into the hands of her closest masculine relative figure. Later, during the Franco-Prussian War of 1871, women were prominent in preventing the army from moving their cannons from Paris, an event which helped spark the Paris Commune.Gay Gullickson, Unruly Women of Paris, p24ff. World War I Suffragette handbill During World War I, women led large numbers of food riots in Germany, Russia, Italy and elsewhere.Belinda Davis in K.Hagemann, Home/Front; the Military, War and Gender in Twentieth Century Germany, Ch.4; Keith Allen, 'Food and the German Home-Front' and Simonetta Ortaggi, 'Italian Women During the Great War' in Gail Braybon, Evidence, History and the Great War, p181, 190, 218-36; Beverley Engel, 'Subsistence Riots in Russia during World War One', Journal of Modern History, Vol.69; Temma Kaplan, 'Women and Communal Strikes in the Crisis of 1917-1922', in Renate Bridenthal, Becoming Visible: Women in European History (1987 Edition); Lynne Taylor, 'Food Riots Revisited', Journal of Social History, Vol.30, No.2; Manuel Castells, The City and the Grassroots, Ch.4. Women workers also led the way in strike-waves in Berlin and Paris. The German authorities reported that union leaders were doing 'everything possible to prevent such disturbances and strikes over food provisions, but ... it is the countless female workers who constantly agitate and stir things up.' Women's prominence in these struggles helped delegitimize the war, and the regimes that were fighting it, paving the way for the huge strike-waves and revolutions at the end of the war.Ute Daniel, The War from Within: German Women in the First World War, p293, 246-50; Laura Lee Downs, Manufacturing Inequality: Gender Division in the French and British Metalworking Industries, 1914-39, p119-144; Davis in Hagemann Home/Front ..., p131. Aftermath of Berlin food riot, 1918 Women also led food riots in Japan and non-belligerent Spain. Women's protests against high food prices spread across Spain in both 1913 and 1918. In Barcelona, in 1918, women used the slogan: 'In the name of humanity, all women take to the streets!'. They organised repeated demonstrations and attacked shops, warehouses, government offices and music halls. Women also staged food riots during the Spanish Civil War.Michael Seidman, Republic of Egos, p102, 219. Russian Revolution Karl Marx had recognized that \\"great social revolutions are impossible without the feminine ferment\\"Manfred Gailus in K.Hagemann, Civil Society and Gender, p178-80; Marx, Engels Collected Works, Vol.43, p184. and, in 1917, it was Petrograd's (Saint Petersburg) female workers who spread the idea of a general strike on 8 March, International Women's Day. On that day, hundreds of women threw stones and snowballs at factory windows demanding for bread. Economic depression in 1917, particularly devastated the working-class women because price of daily necessities increases tremendously, but their low paid wages does not compensate for the increased in price of goods. After a long and tiring day of labor, women had to line up for hours just to get a loaf of bread. Sometimes after wasting hours waiting in line, the bread would run out. The protest were led by thousand of female workers and inspired male factory workers to join them and demand changes. Women participated in the riots by attacking police stations and bakeries. However, many troops refused to shoot protesting women, who were often walking with their children. As Leon Trotsky later wrote, the women took hold of the soldiers' rifles and 'beseeched almost commanded: \\"put down your bayonets and join us\\"', and, within five days, the centuries-old Tsarist regime had collapsed.Choi Chatterjee, Celebrating Women; Gender, Festival, Culture and Bolshevik Ideology, p43-54; Jane McDermid and Anna Hillyar, Midwives of the Revolution, 147-157; Kaplan in Bridenthal, Becoming Visible...,. As Bolshevik took over Petrograd and Moscow in October 1917, tense relationship were discern between rulers and working-class women. Scarcity and hunger made it very difficult for Russian workers to transform society themselves and women's participation did not continue at the same level as in February/March 1917. However, it was women's food protests, in May 1918, that sparked the first major wave of workers' unrest against the new Bolshevik authorities.Alexander Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks in Power, p229-30. Then, later, during Joseph Stalin's program of breakneck industrialization and forced collectivization, women were again at the forefront of the workers' strikes and peasant protests that resisted this brutal policy.Lynne Viola, Peasant Rebels under Stalin, p176-84, 202-9, 237-8; Jeffrey Rossman, Worker Resistance under Stalin, p6-7, 206, 232. Stalin's regime was, however, able to contain all resistance through starvation and repression. Colonial revolts Women were prominent in various revolts in the colonial and ex-colonial world. One of the most notable in Africa was the Igbo Women's War against British tax collection in Nigeria in 1929.Bonnie G.Smith, Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History, Vol.1, p540; M.J.Diamond, Women and Revolution; Global Expressions. Women in southern Igboland believed that they were being wrongfully taxed for palm products by the British. This led to what the British called the Aba Riots, and the Igbo, the Women's War. This rebellion tested the political institutions of the Igbo women which have been established prior to colonization. Women took initiative by sending messages through the market and kinship networks connecting to other villages calling for a mikiri meeting. They also took advantage of strikes, boycotts, and force to project their opinions and retaliate against authority. Women of wealth and generosity who could speak well typically took leading roles in village wide mikiri gatherings, which had the largest influence on the rise of the Women's War. During mikiri, decisions were made on how to respond against being wronged by the Warrant Chief's corruption and by the taxes that they anticipated to be enforced upon them.Judith Van Allen (1972) \\"Sitting on a Man\\": Colonialism and the Lost Political Institutions of Igbo Women, Canadian Journal of African Studies/La Revue canadienne des √©tudes africaines, 6:2, 165-181, DOI: 10.1080/00083968.1972.10803664 During the late 1940s, the Abeokuta Women's Revolt protested the Nigerian colonial government's imposition of new taxes upon women. Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti led mass protests of women outside the palace of the local ruler. The civil rights movement and feminism since the 1950s It was a boycott of segregated buses by African-American women that sparked the civil rights movement in 1955. This case inspired activists across the world to make a change and fight oppressions.M. Bahati Kuumba, Gender and Social Movements (2001), AltaMira Press, U.S. p24, 33-4, 74, 80. Young women's rejection of the patriarchal family and sexual repression was also a major factor in the rebellions of the 1960s.'Women '68ers, Marching on Alone', Lynne Segal,Radical Philosophy, No.149. Women started to defy the typical housewife characteristics and they also demanded equal pay for man and women who worked the same job. Sexual revolution was also transcending in the 1960s as women embraced their sexuality and nature more openly. The revived feminist movement then helped transform gender roles in the following decades. Storm√© DeLarverie, a Black/biracial butch lesbian, is credited with inciting the Stonewall uprising in New York City in 1969. Stonewall was a major turning point in the gay liberation and LGBTQ rights movements. Women were also at the forefront of many working class struggles in the 1970s and 1980s. (For example, in the British Isles, women's protests and leadership were significant during the 'troubles' in Northern Ireland, during the Grunwick strike and during the miners' strike.Fairweather, McDonough and McFadyean, Only the Rivers Run Free: Northern Ireland, the Women's War (1984), Pluto Press ; Wikipedia: Grunwick Dispute; Wikipedia: Women Against Pit Closures.) For a long time, Iranian women struggled with basic human rights and oppression due to traditional religious affiliations and political attributes. Their Islamic beliefs conceal the issues of gender inequalities and the domination of man towards Iranian women. On 1979, in the course of Islamic Revolution, women gathered and protested on the streets but the changes were nonexistent. It wasn't until 1990s where the impact of Islamic Revolution was seen as intolerant to women. This is when young women and activist started going against the Islamic ideologies, for instance, getting a divorce or wearing clothes that were revealing. Significant changes of basic human rights and the oppression of Iranian women has been perceived since 1990s and it has been progressing notably until today. Recently on January 20, 2017, the day after Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th US president, women, men, and children marched in protest of Trump and to promote solidarity with other women in order to resist women's oppression and mistreatment. Over 680 marches throughout the US and in more than 68 countries around the world were held as part of the Women's March. More than 1,000,000 people participated in the \\"flagship march\\" in Washington D.C.Chenoweth, Erica; Pressman, Jeremy (2017-02-07). \\"Analysis  This is what we learned by counting the women's marches\\".

The Rojava revolution, or Rojava conflict, is the political disaster, social revolution, and military battle that has taken place in recent years. The Rojava Revolution has been characterized by the prominent role women have had during these times of strife.The YPG, Women's Protection Units The novel Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan documents the Kurdish women and how they were and still are oppressed. As Kurds, they were denied basic rights, in many cases even citizenship; and as women they were trapped in patriarchal domination. The Kurdish women's movement seeks to overcome the alienation of Kurdish women. The fight for women's rights has always been a part of Kurdish history. One of the first signs of revolution in Rojava was the election of H√™v√Æ √ébrah√Æm to the post of the prime minister in February 2014. Indeed, many women were assuming leadership positions. Asya Abdullah is regarded to be one of the most radical and effective revolutionaries in the world today. She has been the driving force in the battle for Kurdish freedom. She wants women around the world to become more aware of their own fight. With this transformation, women also began getting involved with security and military roles. In 2012, women from the PYD, the People's Protection Units, created a unit dedicated to the fight for women. The Women's fighting units, also known as YPJ, have played a role in the liberations of towns like Kobani and Manbij. Since September 2014, Kurdish women have been playing a leading role in the fight against ISIS. The creation of the YPJ is a fascinating development in a region where women's rights are often repressed. But with the formation of these groups, has come with sexist media coverage. The media is more concerned with the fighters looks rather than what they are fighting for. Women in the PKK guerrilla army have developed Jineoloji (also known as Jineology) which simply put, means women's science. The goal of jineology is to given women and society access to science and knowledge and to strengthen the connections of science and knowledge to society. The Rojava Revolution has been characterized by a high level of women participation politics, safe houses for women dealing with sexual assault or violence, and women-run academies dedicated to the study of Jineology. Out of the conflict of the popular uprising in Syria, Kurdish women took up arms alongside men and took control of Northern Syria, also known as Rojava. The women fight alongside men both in mixed units of the People's Protection Units (YPG) as well as in their own Women's Protection Units (YPJ). Women constitute an estimated 35 percent of the entire Kurdish forces. The creation of the first human societies Studies of contemporary hunter- gatherers show that their strong sense of moral community is maintained by autonomous individuals who constantly resist any form of personal domination. In fact, many hunter-gatherers are so egalitarian and communistic that even a non-Marxist anthropologist like Christopher Boehm argues that hunter-gatherer societies - the first human societies - must have originated in uprisings against dominant males.Christopher Boehm, Hierarchy in the Forest; the Evolution of Egalitarian Behaviour, p1-10, 84-9, 172-3, 193-6, 249, 256. Chris Knight, and other anthropologists influenced by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, have theorised that these uprisings were led by women looking for collective support to ease their childcare burdens.Chris Knight, 'Sex and the Human Revolution' and 'Solidarity and Sex'; Chris Knight, Camilla Power, Ian Watts, 'The Human Symbolic Revolution', The Cambridge Archaeological Journal, Vol.5, p75ff; www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/publications.htm. They have used a wide range of evidence from anthropology, primatology, mythic narratives, evolutionary biology and archaeology. Some Marxists have dismissed these ideas.Chris Harman, International Socialism, No.54, p169-74. Some other Marxists have been more positive, e.g. Jack Conrad, 'Origins of Religion and the Human Revolution'. However, although the idea of women-led uprisings creating the first societies is controversial, a number of highly respected anthropologists have taken the thesis seriously. (Mary Douglas, Robin Dunbar, David Lewis-Williams, Caroline Humphrey, Marilyn Strathern, Clive Gamble, Keith Hart and Chris Stringer have all made favourable comments about Knight's work.Chris Knight, Blood Relations; Reviews of Blood Relation; Chris Stringer, Origin of Our Species.)

Biography Maral Rahmanzade was born on July 23, 1916 in the Mardakan township near Baku. From 1930 to 1933 she studied at the Azerbaijan State Technical School of Arts and from 1934 through to 1940 she continued her education at the Moscow State Institute of Arts. Her most productive area was within the graphic genre, particularly in lithography and coloured linoprints . Rahmanzade created series of easel paintings of patriotic content during the Great Patriotic War. One of the series is dedicated to the Soviet women during the wartime, including \\"People's volunteer corps\\", \\"Women in the ranks\\", \\"Partisan's daughter\\", and \\"Radio operator\\". Other series, consisting of 19 lists, were dedicated to the work of people and the home front: ‚ÄúWork on the farm‚Äù, ‚ÄúSocial activists‚Äù, and ‚ÄúThe artists performing for the front-line soldiers‚Äù. Women working at machines in factories are depicted in ‚ÄúWives Substitute Husbands‚Äù. These paintings were made by the artist in the art of black watercolors with following elaboration with coal. In 1940s, Rahmanzade worked on illustration of belles-lettres. In 1945, she designed the books ‚ÄúDehname‚Äù by Khatai and \\"The land of fires\\" by Zohrabbeyov. More successfully. she worked on poetic images of women in \\"Dehname\\". Rahmanzade portrayed poet Khatai, the author of the book, in two illustrations: on one of them his portrait is in profile and on the other the poet is portrayed with a pen in hand in a poetic atmosphere of night. Rahmanzade portrayed circumstances, landscape, architecture, and costumes on numerous illustrations of ‚ÄúThe land of fires‚Äù novel, following the literary description. Riders were portrayed on the first illustration, on the left side of a list. A pictorial panorama of a bay and a mysterious tower to which landlady they were going opened in front of their eyes. During these years Maral Rahmanzade created illustrations to Jafar Jabbarly's \\"Maiden tower\\" and \\"Gulzar\\" works. In the post-war period Rahmanzade intensively worked in the sphere of easel graphic. In 1947, series of \\"Petroleum\\" autolithography consisting of 10 lists which showed the history of petroleum land was exhibited on jubilee exhibition for the first time. The series beginning with \\"Fire worshippers\\" composition representing a scene of worship to eternal fire. Other lists of these series are \\"A new enterprise\\", \\"On the oilrig\\", \\"Jack-pump\\", \\"Fountain hammered to a pipe\\". In 1948, Maral Rahmanzade finished series called \\"Socialistic Baku\\", consisting of 10 lists. It included industrial and urban landscapes, and also such genre compositions as \\"Shift of a vigil\\", \\"Day of a vigil\\", \\"In construction of a new house\\". Journeys to \\"Oil rocks\\" were productive for the artist. Maral Rahmanzade was the first artist who went to work in \\"Oil Rocks\\". Being among oilmen, overseeing their working days, their everyday life, she painted field landscapes of the Caspian Sea, construction of scaffold bridges, oil tanks, towers, pouring of oil. On a report exhibition she presented drawings and watercolor paintings, portraying more typical episodes of working life of oilmen of the Caspian Sea. Besides the citizens of Baku, workers of \\"Oil Rocks\\" also saw these paintings, as they were dedicated to them. Rahmanzade created series of autolithographs called \\"Here-in the Caspian Sea\\". An album, consisting of 15 colourful lithographs from these series was published in Moscow. Verticals of towers, steel scaffold bridges, shining mirror-like surface of the sea were described on \\"In the open sea\\" lithograph. The artist portrayed hard life of workers, distinctive life of oilmen on \\"On-duty boat\\", \\"The food is brought\\", \\"To a storm-zone\\" paintings. These series of lithographs brought a broad fame to Rahmanzade and were exhibited in the All- Union and foreign exhibitions for many times. Maral is the eldest sister of sculptor and honouree of the Academy of Arts of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Vagif Rakhmanov. She is the Aunt of acclaimed Canadian singer songwriter and visual artist Deniz Reno (aka Deniz Rakhmanova), Kazakh-German painter Nargis Rakhmanova-Dressler and Kazakh artisan Aigul Rakhmanova. In 1950, Rahmanzade designed two volume poem of Jafar Jabbarly. She created a lot of lists, portraying personages of \\"Sevil\\", \\"Almaz\\", \\"Withered flowers\\" plays of Jafar Jabbarly. M.F.Akhundov's historical play \\"Aldanmish Kevakib\\" (\\"Deceived stars\\") was published in that very year with illustrations of Maral Rahmanzade. Maral Rahmanzade illustrated also translated publications ‚Äì \\"Eugene Onegin\\" of A.S.Pushkin, \\"A Hero of Our Time\\" M.Y.Lermontov. At the end of 1950s Maral Rahmanzade created series of colorful autholithographs called \\"Baku\\". Urban parks and squares, panoramas of marine oil fields are portrayed on these lists. \\"Baku\\" series were for the first time exhibited on the exhibition dedicated to Decade of Azerbaijani literature and arts in 1959, in Moscow. At that time Maral Rahmanzade worked on autolithographs dedicated to Czechoslovakia, among which were distinguished such landscapes as \\"A winter day of Karlovy Vary\\", \\"A street in Cheb city\\", \\"Central square of Cheb city\\", \\"Richmond sanatorium\\" and others. Lithographs of Czechoslovakia series were exhibited on Republican exhibition \\"The world through the eyes of Azerbaijani artists\\" in 1961, and also on group exhibition dedicated to Czechoslovakia in Moscow. In subsequent years, M.Rahmanzade worked in the technique of linocut. First works made in this type of arts she dedicated to giant-factories of two young cities ‚Äì Sumqayit and Rustavi. Each of two series consists of six industrial and urban landscapes and two portraits portraying front-rank workers. In 1960s, the artist visited a lot of remote regions of Azerbaijan. New series of colored linocuts were result of these visits: ‚ÄúMy Motherland‚Äù and ‚ÄúAzerbaijan‚Äù. A lot of paintings of these series were dedicated to Nakhchivan. Plough-land, furrow lines leading to the river, and a village stretched across the river were portrayed in one of these landscapes. In other linocut the artist portrayed a new way in the mountains: high-tension transmission line and highway on the background of beautiful rocks. Landscape of Khinalig village in the northern part of Azerbaijan was also described in these series besides the landscapes of Nakhchivan. In this remote village, surrounded by cliffs, with fair-roofed houses on the top of mountain, as if they had been built on each other. The artist learnt everyday life of residents of Khnialig, and painted with watercolors a lot. In these linocuts the artist portrayed laqndscapes of the village, mountains eternally covered with snow, steeps, simple formed buildings, residents in national costumes. In 1956, M.S.Ordubadi's historical novel \\"A Sword and Pen\\" illustrated by M.Rahmanzade was published in Baku. In 1963, she illustrated academic publications of \\"Azerbaijani fairytales\\".

Biography Roesli was born with the full name Djauhar Zaharsjah Fachruddin Roesli in Bandung, West Java, on 10 September 1951; he was the youngest of Major General Roeshan Roesli's four children. Harry Roesli is the grandson of Marah Roesli, a famous Indonesian writer from Minangkabau background. Harry Roesli wed to Kania Perdani Handiman, the couple have twin sons, Layala Khrisna Patria and Lahami Khrisna Parana. In 1970, he enrolled in the aviation engineering program at the Bandung Institute of Technology. He also studied music under Remy Sylado and Slamet Abdul Sjukur. In the early 1970s, Roesli formed The Gang of Harry Rusli. First playing rock and blues, they later switched to acoustic and made a protest album inspired by Bob Dylan. He released his debut solo album, Philosophy Gang, in 1973. Although initially interested in becoming a writer like his grandfather and writing numerous pieces of poetry, his work was never published. After his album with The Gang of Harry Rusli, he went to the Jakarta Art Educational Institute. then studied on scholarship at the Rotterdam Conservatory in the Netherlands for two years; he graduated in 1981. Upon his return, Roesli began work on an avant-garde project mixing the sounds of Iannis Xenakis, John Cage, and Karlheinz Stockhausen with poetry by Yudhistira Ardi Noegraha. In 1982 Roesli began occasionally collaborating with Putu Wijaya; the two would sometimes go overseas together for performances. Roesli also collaborated with Nano Riantiarno's Teater Koma and several international troupes. He also took a position as professor of music at the Indonesia University of Education and Pasundan University, both in Bandung. On 17 August 2001, Roesli performed a satirized version of the patriotic song \\"Garuda Pancasila\\", changing the lyrics to say that he was tired of the lack of reform in the period following the fall of Suharto. The performance, held during independence day celebrations in front of the home of former president Abdurrahman Wahid, led to him being questioned by police; the police considered charging him with expressing hatred and hostility toward the Indonesian government, a crime under Article 154 of the Criminal Code. Roesli later wrote a letter of apology to family of the song's composer, Sudharnoto, and issued a public apology to those who may have been offended. Citing health issues, he requested a delay in questioning. The issue was eventually dropped. From 19 to 21 October of the same year, Roesli held his first exhibition since Independence Day. The event, titled \\"Teroris, Pentas Musik 50 Jam\\" (\\"Terrorist, 50-hour Music Performance\\") and held at Rumah Nusantara cafe and gallery in northern Bandung, featured hundreds of singers ranging from the well known to street artists. Roesli was known for sympathizing with street musicians, eventually turning his home in an elite district of Bandung into the Harry Roesli Music Education Institute; the institute provided training to talented street children free of charge. Roesli also donated his front yard as a place for street vendors to sell their wares. In 2003, Roesli toured Indonesia with street musicians under his tutelage. The tour, called Ziarah Seni (Pilgrimage of Art), was meant to disprove that Roesli's music was exclusive. In response to claims of exclusiveness, he told The Jakarta Post \\"music is for listening, not for understanding\\". By the time of his death he had helped over 36,000 street children. On 3 October 2004, Roesli was admitted to Harapan Kita Hospital in Jakarta after suffering a heart attack. He died at the hospital at 7:55 pm local time (UTC +7) on 11 December 2004. Among the attendees of his viewing in Menteng, Central Jakarta were former head of the armed forces General Wiranto. Educational figure Arief Rahman led the prayers. After the viewing, his body was buried in the family cemetery in Ciomas, Bogor. Legacy In 2009 Rolling Stone Indonesia selected Roesli's song \\"Malaria\\", from his first solo album \\"Philosophy Gang\\", as the 44th best Indonesian song of all time. Personal life Roesli was a grandson of Marah Roesli, an author known for his novel Sitti Nurbaya (Wrong Upbringing). He married Kania Perdani Handiman in 1980; together the couple had twins. His siblings are all doctors. Hera Diani, writing in The Jakarta Post, notes that he often wore all black. His former teacher Remi Sylado, in an obituary in Tempo, wrote that at times he seemed unkempt, and after returning from the Netherlands was like \\"a river in the rainy season\\", full of unbridled creativity.

Traffic was never heavy and bus competition led to closure to passengers in 1932. Goods traffic might not have survived but a Food Buffer Depot (to provide emergency food rations in wartime) was established at Lauder during World War II and the rail-borne traffic sustained the line for some years. It closed finally in 1958 and little now remains, though bits of the formation, including embankments and cuttings, are visible at Middletoun. History First proposals System map of the Lauder Light RailwayIn the nineteenth century Lauder was in a remote location; there was no industry other than agriculture. In 1846 the Berwickshire Central Railway was proposed, following the Lauder Railway route as actually built and continuing to Earlston and Kelso, but there was no support for the company and it collapsed. In 1848 the line which became the Waverley Route reached Fountainhall from Edinburgh; it had been authorised as the Edinburgh and Hawick Railway but was adopted by the North British Railway. In due course the through route to Carlisle was formed. Encouraged by the proximity of a main line, a public meeting took place in April 1852 for a Lauder branch railway from the Fountainhall line; there was local support for a line, but no subscriptions were forthcoming and the scheme was forgotten. There were further schemes in 1870 and 1883, also without any positive outcome. A horse bus service was operated later over the hills to Stow railway station; it was privately operated but subsidised by the North British Railway. There was no other public transport except a weekly carrier to Dalkeith and another weekly carrier to Galashiels. Light Railway legislation In December 1895 there was strong local agitation for a modern road between Oxton and Fountainhall; the negative response from the County Council encouraged resumed thoughts of a railway once more, and this was encouraged by the passage of the Light Railways Act in 1896. This was designed to encourage the construction of local railway connections without the expense of seeking an Act of Parliament or the safety arrangements of main lines. On 15 December 1896 the promoters - in fact two local landowners - issued a formal notice issued pursuant to a Light Railway Order for the \\"Lauder Light Railway\\". The capital was to be ¬£45,000 and an application was made to Berwickshire County Council for a grant not exceeding ¬£15,000. The estimated cost of construction was ¬£48,308. The administrative procedure for issuing the required Order was very much delayed, but on 30 June 1898 the Light Railway Order was issued. A contract was concluded with Dick Kerr & Co for ¬£34,151 to build the line, with an additional ¬£5,660 for providing the permanent way. The North British Railway subscribed ¬£15,000 of shares, Berwickshire County Council ¬£12,000,Hadjucki; Ross says ¬£12,000 and Lauder Town Council ¬£3,000. Dick Kerr accepted ¬£2,500 in shares as part payment. Work started on 3 June 1899: the Countess of Lauderdale cut the first sod at Lauder. There were considerable difficulties between the Company and the North British Railway, who had agreed to work the line, over permanent way specifications and facilities at the stations. The line opens North British 4-4-0 No. 52 at Lauder, soon after it opened on 2 July 1901 Major Pringle of the Board of Trade inspected the line on 28 June 1901 and found it fit for passenger operation, and the line opened on 2 July 1901. The North British Railway worked the line. The line was actually built for ¬£39,811. It was the first light railway in Scotland.The Carmyllie Railway, near Arbroath, started passenger operation under the Light Railway legislation on 1 February 1900, but it was a long-standing mineral line on which passenger running was then started. There were four passenger trains each way daily; there was never a Sunday service. There was one intermediate passenger station, at Oxton. Shortly after opening, the NBR complained that the cattle dock was unsatisfactory. Cattle had previously been walked to St Boswells for onward rail transport to Newcastle and the NBR emphasised that the rate for the carriage of cattle to Newcastle would need to be pitched carefully to attract the traffic. The short line was of local interest only, and the income from the first three months of operation after deduction of the NBR operation charges was ¬£383. The line certainly encouraged visitors to the area; a new temperance hotel opened in Lauder at the time of opening of the railway, and at Oxton the Tower Hotel opened in 1903. Trout fishing was a noted activity locally and was facilitated by the opening of the line. Later history In 1913 the Lauder Light Railway sought a takeover by the North British Railway, but this was refused by the NBR, which had considerable financial commitments at the time. In 1923 the main line railways of Great Britain were grouped under the Railways Act 1921 and the Lauder Light Railway became part of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). At the end of independent existence in 1922 the company's receipts amounted to ¬£1,362 (goods ¬£785, third class passengers ¬£266). The grouping settlement of 1923 exchanged ¬£15,000 of LNER preferred ordinary stock for the ¬£47,090 of Lauder Light Railway stock, with the LNER accepting liability for Lauder loans of ¬£13,500. The company had paid a dividend of 1.25% to 1,5% during its independent existence. In 1924 the first bus service to Edinburgh was started, and by 1931 the loss of passenger traffic to buses was extreme: the revenue for the year 1931 ‚Äì 1932 was ¬£466, and closure to passengers became inevitable. Closure to passenger traffic was fixed for 10 September 1932, and the last passenger train ran on that day. A low level of goods traffic continued for the time being. The engine shed at Lauder was closed after termination of the passenger service and latterly line was worked by J67 0-6-0 locomotives from Galashiels with tenders attached. The tenders allowed the locomotives to run with their water tanks empty, keeping the total axle loading below the line's limit. New traffic Decline looked inevitable, until during World War II a Ministry of Food buffer depot was established at Lauder. The depot contained emergency basic food staples - chiefly flour - to be distributed to the civilian population in the event of non-availability of food in an emergency. The poor road network in the area ensured that the supplies were brought to Lauder by rail, and this continued in later years. In August 1948 there were extreme rainfall conditions in this area of Scotland; there was torrential rain, climaxing on 12 August 1948, and there were serious landslips near the Gala Water bridge. The line was temporarily closed, but it reopened on 20 November 1950. The Food Buffer Depot was still in existence because of concerns in the Cold War. However the decline of ordinary goods services and a review of the need for the Food Buffer Depot resulted in total closure of the branch line; the last goods train ran on 30 September 1958. The line was totally closed, but an enthusiasts' excursion train organised by the Branch Line Society visited the line on 15 November 1958. Topography The line opened on 2 July 1901 and passenger services ceased on 10 September 1932; the line was officially closed completely after 30 September 1958. The topography of the area forced the line to reach Lauder from Fountainhall in a wide northward sweep around Collie Law, following the Leader Water from Oxton. The line climbed at 1 in 50 from the junction at Fountainhall up to summit at 2.5 miles, then falling at 1 in 50 / 1 in 134 to the 8 milepost, then undulating. The line was 10 miles (16 km) long. Locations on the route were: * Fountainhall Junction; junction station on the Waverley Route; the junction was facing for southbound trains; the station had been opened as Burn House and renamed Fountainhall; the \\"Junction\\" suffix was added during the years of passenger operation on the branch and the name reverted to Fountainhall in April 1959. * Middleton siding; * Hartside siding; * Oxton; * Lauder.

It is located on the Swiss Federal Railway's Rheinfall line and is served by Z√ºrich S-Bahn lines S12 and S33. The station is situated to the west of Schloss Laufen and its single platform overlooks the Rhine immediately below the falls. Immediately to the east of the station the railway line tunnels under the castle and then crosses the Rhine above the falls on a bridge that also carries pedestrian traffic. The station is linked to the castle by a walkway, and is mostly used by visitors to the castle and falls. In 2012, the government of the canton of Z√ºrich proposed that Schloss Laufen am Rheinfall station should be closed from 2015, as it is unable to be adapted for disabled access and is too short to handle the longer trains that are to be introduced then. An alternative of relocating the station onto the nearby Rhine bridge was considered too expensive. The proposal has encountered significant opposition in the cantonal council.

It was met with controversy, with a number of commentators from the country and from abroad depicting it as \\"blasphemous\\", \\"racist\\" and \\"fascist\\". It is a 9 minutes long video spot of (when it was aired) non-commercial nature, in color with stereo sound, which contains a male-voice monologue followed by another male monologue, superimposed on opening background in Eastern Orthodox Christian hymn style as well as tonal music and some sound effects. The airing of the video ceased permanently after few weeks, apparently on MRT's editorial discretion, as well as international pressure.  Content  The video is authored by Niƒçe Dimovski, vice-President of the NGO \\"World Macedonian Congress\\" based in Skopje.–†–∞–¥–∏–æ \\"–ò–ª–∏–Ω–¥–µ–Ω\\" - –ú–µ–ª–±—É—Ä–Ω, –ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–≤—ò—É —Å–æ –ù–∏—á–µ –î–∏–º–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏: –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—ò–∞ –í–µ —ô—É–±–∏. It contains a variety of video samples of original production, archival-documentary, movie clips etc., most of them featuring Ancient Macedonian, Roman, Byzantine scenery and symbols, as well as landscapes. The first monologue contains a prayer towards God in which grievances, alleged historical facts, laments over former and current issues and alleged low status of ethnic Macedonians in general were delivered. The male vocal also complains about worldwide-reaching conspiracy by neighbors of ethnic Macedonians to falsify the historical truth at the disadvantage of Macedonians. After a pause, God answers in to all Macedonians, stating that he created them as Macedonoids ‚Äì progenitors of the White race, besides two other races he created, the Mongoloids and the Negroids, while all the rest were Mulattoes, providing blessings to ethnic Macedonians and revealing eschatological role of ethnic Macedonian people, stating that he will soon arrive in the Republic of Macedonia to state the truth, open graves, including Alexander the Great's one, and bring all of the world to bow in front of Macedonia, which will cause understanding that Macedonians have divine primacy that is to be revealed causing the awe of all humankind.  Reactions  The video caused immediate controversy within intellectual and journalist elite within Republic of Macedonia, mostly of condemnatory nature.–ö–æ—ò —Å–∞–∫–∞ –¥–∞ –≥–æ —Å–º–µ–Ω–∏ –∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—Ç–µ—Ç–æ—Ç –Ω–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Ü–∏—Ç–µ –≤–æ ‚Äû–ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–æ–∏–¥–∏‚Äú? –ñ–∞—Ä–∫–æ –¢—Ä–∞j–∫–æ—Å–∫–∏ 19.02.2012, \\"–û–∫–Ω–æ\\". It did stir quite a lot of polemics and mostly condemnation from variety of commentators, including NGO leaders. It was also caused outrage amongst international, particularly Western, academics. One of subsequent effects of this video is the usage of the term \\"Makedonoidi\\" as a pejorative slang-term of choice for zealous supporters of the theory that today's ethnic Macedonians have ethnically, linguistically, historically preserved the culture of Ancient Macedonians, which were, according to them, not Greeks (see \\"Antiquization\\" for more).

Dearest God, who art in Heaven! Do you see our Macedonian agonies? Do you hear the crying of our fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters and of our children? For the offspring that died for Macedonia? 0:47-2:27 We have bled for thousands of years, the living wounds of our offspring are left to them. O, Lord, You are the Only One in Heaven. Only You are looking at our mother, crucified at four sides as the Son of God. Wherever You go, You are stepping over a grave and fall over bones. O, Lord, appear now, tell us the truth, to us and to the world, because St. Nicholas came in my dream and told me: \\"and I am from the land of love and goodness, and I am a Macedonian. And I shed a bloody tear in the pot of our pain. But the truth is with the Almighty. Ask Him and He will tell, because our Macedonian era has arrived. O, Lord, only You know that two truths exist, but justice is only one. Thousands of books were spread all over the world by our neighbours with fake history and twisted truths about Macedonia. O, Lord, only You know our true justice: who we are, where we come from and why we are Macedonians? And to the Apostle Paul during a dream a Macedonian appeared, saying: \\"Come to Macedonia and help us\\". 2:28-3:24 And St. Apostle Paul listened to the prayer and first came among us, Macedonians. And now here, for two thousand years we have believed only in You, and in two thousand Churches and Monasteries we pray and from the eternity we are waiting for You. I already can't remember, but I know, I, Macedon of Govrlevo, I have been alone with God for eight thousand years and I pray in front of the largest cross in the world. You, the only Lord, dearest God in Heaven, listen to our prayer, come to Armageddon, lend us a hand and tell us the truth about the evil and the good, to us and to the whole world, because no more blood left in us, for the great mother - Macedonia. \\"God\\" is supposed to say the following: 3:48-5:16 Divine blessing for you, my Macedonians. I have waited for thousands of years to be called by you. From always being with you, from eternity I come, I am already among you because here neither time nor space exists. Here, where I am, the time is still. But where you are, the time is now, for me to explain. I have inhabited Your mother Earth with three races: the white Macedonoids, the yellow Mongoloids and the black Negroids. All the rest are mulattoes. From you, Macedonians, the descendants of Macedon, I have impregnated the white race and everything began from you, to the Sea of Japan. All white people are your brothers because they carry the Macedonian gene. And all the migrations started from your place towards the north. Kokino, Porodin, Radobor, Angelci, Barutnica, Govrlevo, wherever you dig you shall find the truth who you are, why you are who you are and from where you have come. Evil diabolic souls have obscured the truth for thousands of years, lying to the world. 5:19-6:37 How much have you suffered and to what kind of plights did you pass, because I was leading you into temptation, but you have stayed faithful, my children. Children of the sun and of the flowers, blessed with joy, love and goodness. I sent you kings for thousands of years and now I am giving you again. You are giving them to everybody, you didn't leave them for yourselves. How many Tsars are here with Me and how many Macedonians there are, so many stars are in the heavens and sand in the sea. Let all the Angels sing, for everybody who is with Me who, out of love for Macedonia, exchanged their life for eternity and shared the kingdom here with Me. Already the Angels are singing for all of you who understood God's glory, for all of you to which I gave a part of Paradise, for all of you to whom I gave love and peace, for all of you who waited for Me and saw My arrival. 6:40-8:23 Here, I am now coming to Macedonia, I am now among you, to tell you the real truth, which is among you under the soil. I shall open the grave of Alexander, the Macedonian Tsar, and I shall bring the entire world to bow before you. How many Macedonian graves I have yet to open, because souls near me desire the truth! Love your greatest enemies, because I send them to be of greatest help to you. The truth about Macedonia and you, Macedonians, should be known to the world. Because you were first of the first and the most dignified among the most dignified. Now the Macedonian era has arrived, the whole world will obtain the truth, to see that it is an honor and a blessing to be a Macedonian, a descendant of Macedon and son of the God of the Universe. Children of mine, blessed and eternal be, here where the sun and flowers rule, let there be eternal joy, love and goodness. Among you, I am now noble.

Set in Western Australia's wheatbelt in 1968 (though filmed at Harden, New South Wales),Filming locations at IMDb it stars Xavier Samuel and Clarence John Ryan as two teenagers whose interracial friendship struggles to withstand the expectations of their community. The film sensitively documents the disparity and discrimination faced by the country's Aboriginal people. Plot Rick and Eve Anderson are traditional wheat-and- wool farmers in Western Australia's drought-prone wheatbelt. Their 15-year-old son Ed enjoys a close friendship with Paddy, the son of Aboriginal labourer Michael Parker whose family lives in a shack on the farm and receives sustenance provisions in return for their labour. Ed attends school in a nearby township. Paddy receives no schooling but Ed has taught him to read, and he aspires to more in life than his family's virtual slavery. One weekend, on a shopping trip to town, the boys go to the cinema, where the colour bar obliges them to sit in separate rows. They see a newsreel about the Aboriginal boxer Lionel Rose who has won a world championship and is a national hero. The boys build an outdoor boxing ring in a field. As they engage in friendly sparring, Paddy forms the ambition of escaping slavery by joining Jimmy Sharman's fairground boxing troupe. Their relationship is also tested by Ed's adolescent attraction to a girl, Amelia, whose family has moved to the property next door. In the previous year (1967), a federal referendum had overwhelmingly determined removal of official discrimination against Aborigines, and given the federal parliament power to make special laws with regard to them. There was simultaneous agitation for other rights, including equal pay for farm workers. However, when Paddy's father enquired whether he could be given wages, his boss Rick Anderson replied that he lacked funds. The Aboriginal family could either continue unpaid or vacate their home on the farm. Michael Parker, whose wife was caring for a new baby, saw no option than to go on working without pay. The film concludes with Paddy's departure to seek his fortune in boxing, and a reconciliation as Ed apologises for former disloyalty to his friend.

It is a public limited, listed company. It manufactures products like domestic air coolers, industrial air coolers. Symphony has its operations in about 60 countries., The Business Hindu Line. It is also certified by the Guinness World Record Ltd. for manufacturing the world's largest functioning air cooler.  History  Initially incorporated as Sanskrut Comfort Systems Ltd. (SCS) in 1988 that manufactured consumer durables under brand name ‚ÄòSymphony‚Äô. Then later in the year 1990, Symphony aired its first TV campaign. Symphony went public in the year 1994 and was also listed at Bombay, Ahmedabad and Delhi stock exchanges. It also included water heaters in its range of products in the same year. In the year 2000, Symphony introduced the world's largest air cooler, Sumo, which got the Guinness World Record certification. It launched mid-segment coolers, in the year 2001. For coastal markets, in the year 2004, Symphony launched the H! Cool air cooler. Symphony's winter air cooler and Sauna water heater were introduced in the year 2005. In 2006, Symphony expanded itself into 33 other countries and also introduced the Surround cooler. In 2008, it separated the range of air coolers in two different ranges. Also launched Jumbo Jr., H! Cool with Ionizer in the same year. In 2009, it launched Sauna water heater, India's first water heater with a 5-star power savings rating. It also acquired IMPCO, USA, in the same year. In 2010, Symphony introduced Industrial coolers in Indian market. Symphony introduced air coolers with remote control, in the year 2011. In 2012, Symphony launched digital models named Storm 70E and Storm 100E. 2015 was their year for crossing the market value of $1.5 Billion followed by launching the range of packaged coolers. The Cloud air cooler was launched by Symphony in 2016 along with their i-pure cooler technology.  Global Presence  Symphony's 25-30 percent of the turnover comes from international market as it covers Mexico, Europe, United States, West Asia and South-East Asia. The year 2008 marked Symphony's foray in the North American market. Symphony acquired the Mexican assets of the International Metal Products Company (IMPCO) which was founded by Adam Goettl, the man who invented air coolers for $650,000. With this collaboration, Achal Bakeri realized that IMPCO's large commercial air coolers could be deployed to India too. In the year 2015, Symphony announced acquisition of Chinese air cooler company Munters Keruilai Air Treatment Equipment (Guangdong) Co. Ltd. (MKE) that owns the brand Keruilai, for Rs 1.5 cr. They signed an equity transfer agreement with the shareholders of MKE to acquire 100 per cent of their equity share capital. This marked Symphony's entry into the China market which is the second largest air cooler market in the world after India. Further in 2018, Symphony announced its agreement to purchase 95% equity stake in Climate Technologies, an Australian manufacturer of cooling and heating products. The deal was signed as an opportunity to reduce business risks as a result of opposite winter and summer seasons in India and Australia. The acquisition was executed at a valuation range of A$40‚Äì44 million (lNR 201 Crs - INR 22I Crs).  Diversified Product Offering  It was in the year 1994 that Symphony diversified its product offering in household electrical appliances sector in order to counter the seasonal nature of the air cooler business. The company launched a variety of products such as water heaters, purifiers, washing machines, domestic flour mills, room heaters, and exhaust fans. However, Symphony soon realised that their strength primarily lies in manufacturing only air coolers. Between 2002 and 2004, Symphony exited all other categories except air coolers. It resumed its focus on innovating in air coolers and came out with products priced between ‚Çπ5,000 and ‚Çπ20,000, boasting of features such as touch-based and motion-based control sensors, and mosquito repellent and air cleaning technologies.  How Symphony Products Work  Symphony Air coolers operate on the simple principle of evaporation. So, instead of using chemicals or refrigerants to cool a space, air coolers use two natural elements to provide cooling - fresh air and water. Air coolers cool the room the way sweating cools your body. Water vapor is introduced into the air, which raises humidity and lowers the temperature. Traditional Indian homes and villages used porous earthen vessels filled with cool water to create a pleasant indoor environment. Since the method is simple, an air cooler doesn't incorporate complicated machinery or special chemicals to work. All this results in lower operating costs. The company delivers market-leading products with design innovation, improved energy conservation, distinctive styling and customer-centric design. Symphony Limited consists of a range of coolers designed to meet the requirements of every cooling need ‚Äì a quiet home, busy office or bustling factory. They manufacture three types of air coolers - Residential, Commercial and Industrial.  Acquisition  In 2015, Symphony Ltd acquired Munters Keruilai Air Treatment Equipment, a Chinese air cooler company. In June 2018, Symphony Ltd signed an agreement to purchase 95% equity stake in Climate Technologies Pty Limited (\\"Climate Technologies\\", or \\"CT\\"), an Australian manufacturer of cooling and heating appliances. The acquisition was to be executed at a valuation range of AS 40-44 million (INR 201 - 221 crs) depending on the achievement of FY18F EBITDA (June ended).

He wears glasses and a beaver hat. In his left arm are a walking stick and a copy of a newspaper. Christian Frederik Gotfried Friele (22 May 182124 January 1899) was a Norwegian newspaper editor. Born in Bergen to a prosperous family, he received a deficient education, but managed nevertheless to find his way into the conservative Morgenbladet newspaper. As its editor-in-chief, he became known for his wit and sharp-tongued remarks; he ruthlessly derided key contemporary political figures as \\"clerical lutefisk\\" and \\"royal stable jacks\\". In the 1884 impeachment case against Prime Minister Christian August Selmer, Friele sided with Selmer, and retreated from his position as editor of Morgenbladet following the court's verdict. Firmly believing that orders of merit would compromise his integrity as editor, he twice declined the offer of being rewarded the Order of St. Olav. Early life and education Friele was born to the merchant Ole Morup Friele (1790‚Äì1852) and his wife Louise Engelche Bohr (1797‚Äì1869) in the West-Norwegian city of Bergen on 22 May 1821. The family was relatively wealthy; consequently Friele did not experience the wretched living conditions of many of his contemporaries. His birthplace had a profound impact on his later life; the writer and poet Johan Sebastian Welhaven ‚Äì also from Bergen ‚Äì taught him how to fine-tune Bergen-style sarcasms, for which Friele became feared in his later editorship. He enrolled in law studies in 1838, at the age of 17. A not very assiduous student, he used 13 years to collect his law diploma ‚Äì other students typically took three to four years. During his studies he befriended the playwright Henrik Ibsen and the author Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson ‚Äì the former he was allowed to address with the informal second-person pronoun Du. Despite his long tuition, Friele was not considered erudite by his contemporaries; rumor had it that he had never read a book or seen a play. Marriage and editorship A party at alt=A black-and-white, slightly blurred photograph of a party outside a white house. To the left is a terrace, to the right a bench and in the middle a small table. There are many persons in the picture, who are formally dressed. Upon finishing his law studies, he was employed as a journalist for the Christiania-Posten newspaper. In 1854 he succeeded Bj√∏rnson as parliamentary referee of Morgenbladet; this change of roles angered Bj√∏rnson, who later would write a scornful play directed at Friele. On 12 December 1860, Friele married Marie Cathrine Lasson (1827‚Äì1909), daughter of the jurist Peder Carl Lasson (1798‚Äì1873) and his wife Ottilia Pauline Christine von Munthe af Morgenstierne (1804‚Äì86); the marriage was happy but childless. Upon Adolf Bredo Stabell's 1865 death, Friele advanced to the chief editor position in Morgenbladet. During his editorship, which lasted until 1893, he mocked contemporary politicians in his venomous and quick-witted articles; he was known through the city for his sharp pen. His inferior education was however of no hindrance; a biographer once commented: \\"The inadequacies in his studies gave his beliefs a steadfast grounding they otherwise would have lacked\\". As editor of Norway's chief conservative organ, Friele championed the politicians of the Stang family and reviled their political adversaries; he once called the liberal politician Ketil Motzfeldt a \\"polemic Ishmael\\". Despite his tendency to ridicule his political enemies, Friele exercised considerable editorial discretion, in the view of his biographer Olaf Gjerl√∏w. Having an aristocratic disdain for gossip, he once rejected an offer to publish a story on a liberal politician's licentiousness. \\"My esteemed Gentleman, I think the libidos are quite evenly distributed between the parties\\", he told the tattler. Friele's career as editor culminated with the 1880s impeachment case against Prime Minister Christian August Selmer. The Liberal Party attempted to get rid of the \\"senior official government\\" through the legal system; however, it needed 72 mandates to win a majority in the Lagting and call for an impeachment. The party won the subsequent election in a landslide, and proceeded to the court on 18 May 1883. The debate surrounding the impeachment case was dominated by Friele and Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson, the former who devoted page up and page down in Morgenbladet to the proceedings, and the latter who wrote vehement letters from Paris. The whole commotion ended with Selmer being sentenced to leave his office; he stepped down on 8 March. Friele was infuriated, and condemned King Oscar II for an alleged coup d'√©tat. After this defeat, Friele resigned from his editor position in Morgenbladet, curtly stating to his successor Nils Vogt: \\"Oh my, how this paper regresses\\". Nevertheless, he kept editing the newspaper until 1893. Death and legacy Friele's tomb at alt=a stone tomb surrounded by green gras Friele was twice in his life offered a knighthood of the Order of St. Olav; he rejected both offers. The first time he turned down the offer with the words: \\"Editor of the Royal Norwegian Morgenbladet, what? No safer way to compromise the position of the paper and its editor!\\"; the second with the words: \\"Would your Majesty force me to leave the country?\\". He died on 24 January 1899 in Kristiania and was buried in V√•r Frelsers gravlund together with his wife. Friele as a fictional character was present rather frequently in the contemporary literature: Ibsen's character Daniel Heire has acquired some properties from Friele; Knut Hamsun describes him briefly in Hunger; in Alexander Kielland's Arbeidsfolk he receives contemptuous treatment; and Bj√∏rnson wrote a play titled Redakt√∏ren (\\"the Editor\\") in which Friele is the protagonist. The conservative politician C. J. Hambro described him thus: > Men with greater names and with higher status in history are forgotten and > will remain so. Christian Friele will be remembered; the memory and the myth > have glossed his name and mitigated the sharp echo it once had. He is the > first man in Norwegian history who will be remembered for being a > journalist.

They derived the name from a dictionary definition of coolie which defines the derogatory word as \\"one who does heavy work for little pay\\". dig..? The Coolies' first album, dig..? was released in 1986 by DB Records, and consisted of nine tongue-in-cheek covers of Simon & Garfunkel classics plus a version of Paul Anka's 1974 No. 1 hit, \\"(You're) Having My Baby\\". While Anka's version received criticism for perceived sexist undertones, Coolies lead singer Clay Harper added a brief spoken interlude at the end of the song in which he reveals that she is not the only woman in town having his baby. Thus, he must leave town. \\"Scarborough Fair\\" was released as a 7‚Ä≥ single. Doug dig..? was followed up in 1988 by the rock opera Doug. Doug contains thirteen original tracks, mostly written by guitarist Rob Gal, in the style of various previously existing bands. For example, \\"Cook Book\\" is reminiscent of the Who's Tommy, and \\"Pussy Cook\\" is more-or-less a reworking of the Beastie Boys' \\"Cooky Puss\\". Other bands paid homage to or spoofed include Led Zeppelin, John Lennon and The Replacements. Doug is the story of a skinhead, named Doug, who kills a drag queen short-order cook, steals his recipe book and becomes a \\"culinary giant\\" when the cookbook becomes a nationwide bestseller. Doug embraces the celebrity lifestyle of stretch limousines and partying. Soon, his guilt drives him to become paranoid, and he's certain that the entire food service industry knows of his crime and is out for revenge‚Äîso he decides he will stop eating, and subsist solely on crack cocaine and alcohol. Having squandered his fortune on luxuries and drugs, Doug ends up back on the streets in poverty. IGN rated Doug the fourteenth greatest rock opera of all time in 2006. A comic book version of this tale, drawn by singer/songwriter Jack Logan was included with the LP record and could be acquired by sending a dollar to DB Recs. Original drummer Billy Burton, who was essentially moon-lighting from his full-time gig with The Swimming Pool Q's when dig..? was recorded, is replaced by Frogg Jaguar Mellonball on Doug. The album also features John Cerreta on keyboards throughout, though he is not credited with being a member of the band. Cerreta also played keyboards for \\"I Am A Rock\\" on dig..? Take That You Bastards! The Coolies disbanded in 1989 while working on a third album. Three tracks recorded during sessions for this album were released in 1995 as Take That You Bastards! on Harper's Casino Records label. Take That You Bastards! is a two disc set containing both Coolies albums in their entirety (with the exception of \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" from dig..?), the three previously unreleased tracks and an additional Simon & Garfunkel cover, \\"The Sounds of Silence\\", which was the B-side of \\"Scarborough Fair\\". Other musical ventures Following the break up of the Coolies, Gal and Harper formed the short lived bands Lester Square, and later Ottoman Empire. After two albums also released on DB Recs, Ottoman Empire also disbanded. Gal joined 6X, while Harper embarked on a solo career with the ten track East of Easter. After this, he recorded a children's record, Not Dogs...Too Simple (A Tale of Two Kitties) with his brother, Mark (who was also a member of Ottoman Empire) in 1998. The album featured guest appearances by Ian Dury (of \\"Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick\\" fame), Drivin N Cryin's Kevn Kinney, former Georgia Satellites guitarist Rick Richards, former Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker, Murray Attaway of Guadalcanal Diary, and the B-52's Cindy Wilson. The Harper Brothers recorded a second children's album, The Slippery Ballerina in 1999. A year later, Clay Harper wrote and produced the concept album Main Street: the Original Soundtrack to the Motion Picture (there is no such movie in spite of this name), but does not appear on it. In 2013, Harper released his second solo album, Old Airport Road. He's also released several singles on Casino over the years. Harper has gone on to become something of a culinary giant himself. He is the owner of the Fellini's Pizza chain and La Fonda Latina Restaurants in Georgia. Gal has moved into audio engineering, with Sugarland's Gold and Green among his credits. Teddy Murray joined Donkey shortly after the Coolies broke up.

The Viking forces were led by a Norse chieftain named \\"Reginherus\\", or Ragnar, who tentatively has been identified with the legendary saga character Ragnar Lodbrok (Old Norse: \\"Ragnarr Lo√æbr√≥k\\", contemporary Icelandic: \\"Ragnar Lo√∞br√≥k\\"). Ragnar's fleet of 120 Viking ships, carrying thousands of men, entered the Seine in March and proceeded to sail up the river. The Frankish king Charles the Bald assembled a smaller army in response but after the Vikings defeated one division, comprising half of the army, the remaining forces retreated. The Vikings reached Paris at the end of the month, during Easter. They plundered and occupied the city, then withdrew when they had been paid a ransom of 7,000 French livres [] of silver and gold from Charles the Bald. Background The Frankish Empire was first attacked by Viking raiders in 799 (ten years after the earliest known Viking attack at Portland, Dorset, in England), which led Charlemagne to create a defence system along the northern coast in 810. The defence system repulsed a Viking attack at the mouth of the Seine in 820 (after Charlemagne's death) but failed to hold against renewed attacks of Danish Vikings in Frisia and Dorestad in 834. The attacks in 820 and 834 were unrelated and relatively minor; systematic raiding did not begin until the mid-830s, with the activity alternating between the two sides of the English Channel. Viking raids were often part of struggles among Scandinavian nobility for power and status. Like other nations adjacent to the Franks, the Danes were well-informed about the political situation in France; in the 830s and early 840s they took advantage of the Frankish civil wars. Big raids took place in Antwerp and Noirmoutier in 836, in Rouen (on the Seine) in 841 and in Quentovic and Nantes in 842. Invasion and siege In March 845, a fleet of 120 Danish Viking ships containing more than 5,000 men entered the Seine under the command of a Danish chieftain named \\"Reginherus\\", or Ragnar. This Ragnar has often been tentatively identified with the legendary saga figure Ragnar Lodbrok, but the accuracy of this remains a disputed issue among historians. Around 841, Ragnar had been awarded land in Turholt, Flanders, by Charles the Bald, but he eventually lost the land as well as the favour of the King. Ragnar's Vikings raided Rouen on their way up the Seine in 845, and in response to the invasion, Charles‚Äîwho was determined not to let the royal Abbey of Saint-Denis (near Paris) be destroyed‚Äîassembled an army which he divided into two parts, one for each side of the river. Ragnar attacked and defeated one of the divisions of the smaller Frankish army, took 111 of their men as prisoners and hanged them on an island on the Seine. This was done to honour the Norse god Odin, as well as to incite terror in the remaining Frankish forces. Map of Paris in the 9th century. The city was concentrated on √éle de la Cit√©, an island in the Seine. The Vikings arrived in Paris on Easter Sunday, 29 March, entered the city and plundered it. During the siege, a plague broke out in their camp. The Norse had been exposed to the Christian religion, and after first praying to the Norse gods, they undertook a fast, acting on the advice of one of their Christian prisoners, and the plague subsided. The Franks could not assemble an effective defence, and the Vikings withdrew only after being paid a ransom of 7,000 livres (French pounds) of silver and gold by Charles the Bald, amounting to approximately . Considering Ragnar's earlier loss of land to Charles, the substantial payment may also have been regarded as some form of compensation to Ragnar, and the invasion itself as an act of revenge. This was the first of a total of thirteen payments of so-called Danegeld to Viking raiders by the Franks (the term is not expressly known to have been used at this point). While agreeing to withdraw from Paris, Ragnar pillaged several sites along the coast on the return voyage, including the Abbey of Saint Bertin. Although Charles had been criticised severely for granting the large ransom payment to the Vikings, he had other more critical issues to deal with at the same time, including disputes with his brothers, regional revolts and disgruntled nobles, as well as pressure from abroad. Since he would have trouble trusting his own counts to assemble and lead troops to defeat Ragnar's large force militarily, paying them off instead would buy Charles time, and possibly peace from further Viking raids‚Äîat least in the near future. Aftermath The same year, a Viking fleet sacked Hamburg, which had been elevated to an archbishopric by Pope Gregory IV in 831 on the initiative of Louis the Pious to oversee the Saxon territory and to support the introduction of Christianity to Scandinavia. In response, the Frankish king Louis the German sent a diplomatic mission, headed by Count Cobbo (one of two court counts), to the court of Horik, demanding that the Danish king submit to Frankish overlordship and pay reparations for the invasion. Horik eventually agreed to the terms and requested a peace treaty with Louis, while also promising to return the treasure and captives from the raid. Horik most likely wanted to secure the border with Saxony as he faced a conflict with King Olof of Sweden and domestic struggles. By the treaty, Louis demanded Horik's obedience, which was further secured by Horik regularly sending embassies and gifts to Louis and his suspension of support to Viking raiders. Although many Vikings had died in the plague during the siege of Paris, Ragnar lived to return home to King Horik. According to a story originating from a member of Cobbo's embassy, Ragnar, having attacked the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s, then in the outskirts of medieval Paris and which Cobbo later visited, attributed the plague to the power of Saint Germain of Paris. While Ragnar showed the gold and silver he had acquired to Horik and boasted about how easy he thought the conquest of Paris had been, he reportedly collapsed crying while relating that the only resistance he had met was from the long deceased saint. As several of Ragnar's men died not long after, the king was so frightened that he ordered the execution of the survivors and the release of his Christian captives. This event, in part, led Horik to receive Archbishop Ansgar, \\"Apostle of the North\\", on friendly terms in his own kingdom. Vikings returned again and again in the 860s and secured loot or ransom but, in a turning point for the history of France, the city's walls held against the Vikings' greatest attacking force in the siege of Paris (885‚Äì86).

Early life  Edward Vernon Sparhawk was born in 1798, in Buckstown (now called Bucksport), Maine, to Thomas Stearns and Mary (Kinsman) Sparhawk.Whitty, J.H. ‚ÄúA New New England Poet,‚Äù The New York Times Saturday Review of Books, August 6, 1910. Sparhawk's father, a Dartmouth-educated lawyer from Templeton, Massachusetts, died on June 4, 1807 at the age of 37.Thomas Stearns Sparhawk‚Äôs grave on Find-a-Grave  Montreal  In his twenties, Vernon lived in Montreal, Quebec with fellow New Englander Ariel Bowman. Bowman published an anonymous book of poetry, Hours of Childhood and Other Poems, in 1820. There has been some contention as to whether the writer of the poems was Sparhawk or Bowman,MacDonald, Mary Lu. ‚ÄúSome Notes on the Montreal Literary Scene in the Mid-1820s‚Äù but a footnote in a stanza memorializing the poet's brother refers to the wreck of the Resource in the Pacific, where Sparhawk's brother William perished in 1818.Report of the wreck of the Resource This points clearly to Sparhawk being the author.  The Canadian Times and libel charges  Sparhawk and Bowman founded and published The Canadian Times and Weekly Literary and Political Reporter, which was in print from January 1823 until some time in 1824. On January 31, 1823, The Times accused the Legislative Council and House of Assembly of Quebec of anti- British sentiment: :The resolutions and addresses of the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly will be found amongst the proceedings of the Provincial Parliament, and cannot be productive of surprise, when the majorities by which they were carried show how completely anti-British was the composition of these bodies. The House of Assembly took offense, and on February 3, 1823, the Speaker issued warrants for the arrests of Bowman and Sparhawk for libel. Bowman was apprehended and held briefly before he escaped, while Sparhawk evaded capture.Roger, Charles. The Rise of Canada from Barbarism to Wealth and Civilization, Kiambo Ridge, p. 332.  The Widow Rock  Sometime in 1824, Sparhawk published The Widow Rock and Other Poems by the American writer Margaret Blennerhassett. The volume was published anonymously, the title page listing its author simply as \\"A Lady.\\"  First marriage  Sparhawk returned to the United States, and on August 7, 1824, he married Julia Brush Lyman in Burlington, Vermont.1822-1831 Marriage Records, Unitarian Church, City of Burlington, Chittenden County, Vermont They remained married until her death in 1836.New-York Spectator 27 June 1836: 2.  Duff Green incident  The late 1820s found Sparhawk working as a reporter in Washington, DC for the National Intelligencer. On January 25, 1928, the owner and editor of the United States Telegraph, Duff Green, confronted Sparhawk in the United States Capitol and accused him of deliberately and maliciously misquoting a speech by John Randolph of Roanoke. The Intelligencer reported that Green viciously assaulted Sparhawk, while the Telegraph insisted that any physical altercation was minor and that Sparhawk has barely been hurt.Belko, W. Stephen. The Invincible Duff Green: Whig of the West, U. Missouri Press, 2006, p. 105. A few days later, Sparhawk petitioned the United States Senate for redress.United States Congress. Congressional Edition, 1927, p. 125. (Printed by none other than Duff Green!)  The Southern Literary Messenger  Sparhawk became acquainted with James E. Heath, editor of the Southern Literary Messenger. His first contribution to the journal, entitled \\"A Tale of a Nose,\\" appeared under the pen name Pertinax Placid in the April 1835, issue. In May Sparhawk succeeded Heath as editor of the Messenger. He was introduced in a \\"Publisher's Notice\\" by publisher Thomas Willis White as \\"a gentleman of approved literary tastes and attainments.\\" His editorship was short-lived, however, as in August of the same year White removed him from the position, although his relationship with the journal continued.

It was heard in the Appellate Division by Joubert JA, EM Grosskopf JA, MT Steyn JA, Nienaber JA and Howie JA on 15 May 1995, with judgment handed down on 30 May.  Facts  Bryant sued the Coopers & Lybrand, a firm of chartered accountants and auditors, in a Circuit Court for damages arising from an alleged breach by Coopers & Lybrand of a verbal agreement between them. Coopers & Lybrand, in a special plea to the Bryant's particulars of claim, contended that Bryant's claim was subject to the terms of a deed of cession concluded between him and Standard Bank, and that in consequence he had divested himself of locus standi to institute the action in question. In his replication to the special plea Bryant averred that the deed, on a proper construction, covered only his business debts. The court a quo dismissed the special plea with costs, and Coopers appealed.  Arguments  The deed provided for the cession in securitatem debiti of Bryant's \\"right, title and interest to all book debts and other debts and claims of whatsoever nature\\" to the bank. The issue, therefore, was whether or not the terms of the deed were broad enough to encompass Bryant's claim against the appellants. CDA Loxton SC, on behalf of the appellants, contended that the plain, ordinary and popular meaning of the words \\"and other debts and claims of whatsoever nature\\" were not capable of being restricted to book debts. These words were unambiguous and were intended to give wider security. The clear intention of the parties was to cover all debts of whatsoever nature, including book debts. It was contended that so literal a construction of the cession would not lead to any absurdity; neither would it be contrary to the expressed intention of the parties. R Wise SC, on behalf of Mr Bryant, argued that, on a proper interpretation of the cession, it did not in its terms include Bryant's claim against the appellants. The parties' intention was that the words \\"and other debts and claims of whatsoever nature,\\" like book debts, should relate to Bryant's trading business; the claim against the appellants did not.  Judgment  The Appellate Division held that the matter was essentially one of interpretation: \\"I proceed to ascertain the common intention of the parties from the language used in the instrument.\\"767D. According to the \\"golden rule,\\" the language had to be given \\"its grammatical and ordinary meaning, unless this would result in some absurdity, or some repugnancy or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument.\\"767D/E-F. The ordinary grammatical meaning of \\"book debt,\\" the court found, citing the second edition of The Oxford English Dictionary, was a debt owed to a tradesman as recorded in his account books. The court noted, however, that a particular word or phrase ought never to be interpreted in vacuo.767F/G-G and H/I. The golden rule provided that, having ascertained the literal meaning of the word or phrase in question, the court had to take into consideration the following: # the context in which such word or phrase was used in its interrelation to the contract as a whole, including the nature and purpose of the contract; # the background circumstances which explained the genesis and purpose of the contract: that is to say, matters probably present in the minds of the parties when they contracted; and # extrinsic evidence regarding previous negotiations and correspondence between the parties, as well as their subsequent conduct, \\"showing the sense in which they acted on the document, save direct evidence of their own intentions.\\" This is necessary when the language of the document is on the face of it ambiguous.768A-E. The court determined that the purpose of the cession was to provide the bank, as cessionary, with continuing security for allowing Bryant, as cedent, access to its banking facilities.768E/FF. As to background circumstances, it was common cause that Bryant had two separate accounts with the bank: a private account for his personal affairs and a business account for his one-man trading business. It was also common cause, as a background circumstance, that Bryant, on 4 April 1985, had asked the bank for an increase of his business account's overdraft facilities in the amount of R60,000.768F-F/G. The court held that expression \\"book debts\\" in the deed of cession \\"unquestionably\\" referred to Bryant's trading debts, and that expressions such as \\"trading,\\" \\"records,\\" \\"accounts,\\" \\"books\\" and \\"in the name of the firm in which I may be trading\\" were \\"obviously\\" intended by the parties to refer to the trading business.768G-H. Furthermore, there was nothing in the deed to indicate that the parties intended to provide security to the bank for Bryant's personal affairs:768H-H/I. > This may be illustrated by means of a few examples such as personal claims > of Mr Bryant based on a marriage settlement, a claim to recover a legacy > under a will, a vindicatory action to recover his private assets etc. The parties accordingly had never intended to include personal claims under the phrase \\"and other debts and claims of whatever nature.\\" It was clear, the court found, \\"from the nature and purpose of the said cession, including its context as a whole,\\" that the phrase was intended to refer instead to business debts, including claims other than book debts.768I-769A. As Bryant's claim was clearly a personal one, and therefore unrelated to his trading debts, and as the terms of the deed were accordingly not wide enough to include such a claim,766A-A/B and B. the court found that the cession did not divest Bryant of his claim.769B/C. In view of this conclusion, the court found it unnecessary to consider the parties' conduct after 16 April 1985, or any other extrinsic evidence relating to surrounding circumstances.769B-C. The appeal was thus dismissed with costs (including the costs of the two counsel)769C. and the decision in the East London Circuit Court, in Bryant v Coopers & Lybrand and Others, reversed by a unanimous judgment.

In the hinterland of Trapezus dwelt the Drilae (Dri/lai, Dri/llai), a Kartvelian tribe which was chronically at war with the Trapezuntians. In 401 BC their territory were invaded by Greek mercenaries, which is attested in Anabasis - the work of ancient Greek soldier and historian Xenophon. Xenophon records that they were most warlike of the pontic tribes and inhabited mountainous and inaccessible land. He also notes that their capital was so well fortified that even experienced Greek soldiers were unable to take it. Drillae were mainly pastoralists, but they were skilled in construction as well. The country of the Drilae was ‚Äúmountainous and difficult to traverse and its inhabitants the most warlike of all that dwell upon the Euxine‚Äù (Xenophon, Anabasis, V.ii.2-27).

He was apprenticed to a Mr. Vye, an engraver, who was married to Roden's sister Lavinia. On Tye's recommendation, Roden moved to London to become an apprentice to George Thomas Doo. He continued to practise engraving for about ten years. Later he returned to Birmingham, where he found success as a portrait painter.

He exhibited between 1843 and 1887 and was a member for 25 years, from 1848 to 1873. In total, Roden exhibited 86 works at the RBSA Gallery, including 65 portraits (presumably all commissions, since none for sale); a few landscapes; paintings of biblical, literary, or classical subject matter; and some engravings. Notable sitters for Roden include Lord Palmerston, Lord Gladstone, Cardinal Newman, Joseph Chamberlain and fellow artist, Peter Hollins. In 1867 Roden was made the Director of the Life Academy. He held the position for two years, before swapping to become the Director of the Costume Academy instead. In 1872 he resigned from this position, and left the society completely in 1873.

Contact with Ram Prasad Bismil Ram Prasad Bismil was always in search of fire arms and ammunition and he contacted Khanna for his support. Khanna could purchase 50 cartridges at a time, so he gave his licence to Bismil to purchase ammunition on his behalf, and a close relationship developed between them. Khanna and Bismil occasionally visited the engineers' colony for their help and most of the engineers helped them. Delhi, Ahmedabad and Gaya Congress In 1918 Khanna participated in the Delhi Congress as a volunteer of \\"Shahjahanpur Seva Samiti\\". Bismil was his group leader. Khanna, along with other volunteers were selling a book entitled \\"Amrika Kaise Swadhin Hua?\\" (en. How America Became Independent?) outside the Congress Camp. The police raided the camp but the unsold books were removed from the camp by Bismil immediately and nobody was arrested. Likewise, Khanna also participated in the 1921 Ahmedabad Congress where the proposal of \\"Poorn Swaraj\\" was placed before the delegates. When Maulana Hasrat Mohani spoke in favour of this proposal and Mohandas K. Gandhi opposed it, Khanna, Ashfaq and Bismil stood up in favour of Mohani and the audience became totally against Gandhi. The proposal was accepted and Non Cooperation Movement was announced to be moved throughout the country under the leadership of Gandhi. When Gandhi withdrew from the movement after Chauri Chaura incident, Khanna started agitation against him along with Ram Prasad Bismil. He also went to Gaya with his team of young volunteers and condemned the decisions of Gandhi in the Congress. When Subhas Chandra Bose and Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru supported their stand Gandhi wrote a very strong letter to Nehru not to support these miscreant elements in the Indian National Congress. Switch to HRA Although Khanna was a dedicated volunteer to Congress, he still assisted Bismil in the formation of a revolutionary party within Shahjahanpur itself. Khanna, Bismil Ashfaq and Roshan, all from Shahjahanpur, Seth Damodar Swaroop from Bareilly, Manmath Nath Gupta, Rajendra Nath Lahiri and Chandra Shekhar Azad from Benaras all joined together and a revolutionary party was declared, which was later named the Hindustan Republican Association. Khanna was a main figure for providing arms and ammunition to this new party. Role in Kakori Conspiracy After the Kakori train robbery, the house of Khanna was searched by Police Sub Inspector Fasahat Husain.Swatantrata Andolan Mein Shahjahanpur Ka Yogdan Page 132 A licensed Mauser Pistol and a few cartridges were found in this search, and they were seized by the police, along with his arms licence. The approver Banarasi Lal gave the clue to C.I.D. Inspector Mr Horten who enquired after the sales registers of M/s Vishwas and Co, an arms dealer of Cownpore and found that a total of 150 cartridges were purchased between 14 February 1924 to 5 January 1925 on his licence. In one entry, dated 7 August 1924, the forged signatures of P.K. Khanna were signed by R.P. Bismil, which was proven by forensic examination of the handwriting. In order to save Khanna from a more severe punishment, Bismil changed his statementSwadhinta Sangram Ke Krantikari Sahitya Ka Itihas (Volume II) Page 227 and affirmed under oath during his trial that the weapon and licence were both obtained by theft from one of Khanna's servants. Khanna was prosecuted and sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment in the Kakori Conspiracy Case. Helping Congress Police tried to use Khanna as a witness against Bismil but he refused to testify and accepted his sentence. Despite opposition from his father, Khanna helped the Congress in further direct actions upon his release from imprisonment under the orders of his leader, Ram Prasad Bismil. He remained with the Congress and was elected M.P. on the party ticket and tried to keep the party true to its revolutionary rootsKakori Shaheed Smriti Page 89 until his death. Projects in Shahjahanpur Under the inspiration and advice of his close associate Ram Prasad Bismil, Khanna devoted his whole life to the service of the people and established half a dozen institutions in the rural sector of his home district ShahjahanpurSwadhinta Sangram Ke Krantikari Sahitya Ka Itihas (Volume II) Page 227 viz; #Kakori Shaheed Inter College, Jalalabad, District Shahjahanpur, #Kakori Shaheed Higher Secondary School, Miranpur Katra, District Shahjahanpur, #Kakori Shaheed Higher Secondary School, Khutar, District Shahjahanpur, #Kakori Shaheed Krishi Prashikshan Farm, Village Chhivkuti, District Shahjahanpur, #Kakori Shaheed Krishi Prashikshan Farm, Village Mahmoodpur Shaijania, District Shahjahanpur, #Kakori Shaheed Krishi Prashikshan Farm, Village Marauri, District Shahjahanpur, After Khanna's death the name of Kakori Shaheed Inter College, Jalalabad was changed to \\"Prem Kishan Khanna Government College\\".http://www.punjabcolleges.com/50494-indiacolleges-Prem-Kishan-Khanna- Government-College-Jalalabad/ Kakori Shaheed Higher Secondary School Miranpur Katra is now known as \\"Kakori Shaheed Inter College\\".https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kakoori-shaeed-inter-college- meeranpur-katra-shahjahanpur-UP/230956386941936 It is known as the best Higher Secondary School founded by Khanna. His other projects Khanna had a great deal of ancestral property and died as a bachelor. He established the \\"Shahid-E-Azam Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil Memorial Trust\\" and donated his whole property through a registered will. He had two other dream projects; #\\"Shahid- E-Azam Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil Memorial\\" and #\\"Kakori Shahid Degree College\\" in Shahjahanpur. Kakori is the place where ten revolutionaries stopped a train and looted the British government's treasury which was being transported in the guard's cabin. A memorial to these revolutionaries has been established in this town.

After the death of Khanna, a government degree college has been established in his name in Shahjahanpur. This \\"Prem Kishan Khanna Government Degree College\\" is affiliated to Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Rohilkhand University, Bareilly. The mission of the college is to develop outstanding managerial talent capable of providing enlightened and effective leadership. The college offers a Bachelor of Arts Degree Course.

Arabanoo was the first Aboriginal person of Australia to live among Europeans. Background Life for the settlers at Port Jackson was difficult in the first years and did not help relations between the Aboriginal people of the Eora clans and the Europeans. Governor Arthur Phillip decided that the \\"state of petty warfare and endless uncertainty\\" had to end. He decided to kidnap an Aboriginal person, as he explained in a Letter to Lord Sydney: \\"It was absolutely necessary that we should attain their language, or teach them ours that the means of redress might be pointed out to them, if they are injured, and to reconcile them by showing the many advantages they would enjoy by mixing with us\\". According to Watkin Tench, who chronicled much of Arabanoo's interactions with the colonists, \\"Pursuant to his resolution, the governor on the 31st of December sent two boats, under the command of Lieutenant Ball of the Supply, and Lieutenant George Johnston of the marines, down the harbour, with directions to those officers to seize and carry off some of the natives. The boats proceeded to Manly Cove, where several Indians were seen standing on the beach, who were enticed by courteous behaviour and a few presents to enter into conversation. A proper opportunity being presented, our people rushed in among them, and seized two men: the rest fled; but the cries of the captives soon brought them back, with many others, to their rescue: and so desperate were their struggles, that, in spite of every effort on our side, only one of them was secured; the other effected his escape.\\" (Chapter III, A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson Including An Accurate Description of the Situation of the Colony; of the Natives; and Of Its Natural Productions). Tench continued, \\"The prisoner was now fastened by ropes to the thwarts of the boat; and when he saw himself irretrievably disparted from his countrymen, set up the most piercing and lamentable cries of distress. His grief, however, soon diminished: he accepted and eat of some broiled fish which was given to him, and sullenly submitted to his destiny. When the news of his arrival at Sydney was announced, I went with every other person to see him: he appeared to be about thirty years old, not tall, but robustly made; and of a countenance which, under happier circumstances, I thought would display manliness and sensibility; his agitation was excessive, and the clamourous crowds who flocked around him did not contribute to lessen it. Curiosity and observation seemed, nevertheless, not to have wholly deserted him; he shewed the effect of novelty upon ignorance; he wondered at all he saw: though broken and interrupted with dismay, his voice was soft and musical, when its natural tone could be heard; and he readily pronounced with tolerable accuracy the names of things which were taught him. To our ladies he quickly became extraordinarily courteous, a sure sign that his terror was wearing off. Every blandishment was used to soothe him, and it had its effect. As he was entering the governor's house, some one touched a small bell which hung over the door: he started with horror and astonishment; but in a moment after was reconciled to the noise, and laughed at the cause of his perturbation.\\" Captivity In order to at first prevent him from escaping, Arabanoo was usually restrained by handcuff and rope, or iron chains, and was locked in a hut with a convict at night. When Arabanoo was first cuffed, he believed the handcuffs to be unique ornaments, but he became enraged when he discovered the purpose. In the aim of improving relations, the kidnapping of Arabanoo did not do a great deal of good. He did not learn English very quickly, \\"At least not to the point where he could make Phillip any wiser on the grievances of the natives.\\" In any case, convicts would soon launch vigilante attacks on the Aboriginal people near Botany Bay. In 1789, smallpox broke out in the settlement, and spread amongst the Indigenous population. Having no immunity, an estimated 2000 died. According to Tench (Chapter IV), \\"An extraordinary calamity was now observed among the natives. A Repeated accounts brought by our boats of finding bodies of the Indians in all the coves and inlets of the harbour, caused the gentlemen of our hospital to procure some of them for the purposes of examination and anatomy. On inspection, it appeared that all the parties had died a natural death: pustules, similar to those occasioned by the small pox, were thickly spread on the bodies; but how a disease, to which our former observations had led us to suppose them strangers, could at once have introduced itself, and have spread so widely, seemed inexplicable. Whatever might be the cause, the existence of the malady could no longer be doubted. Intelligence was brought that an Indian family lay sick in a neighbouring cove: the governor, attended by Arabanoo, and a surgeon, went in a boat immediately to the spot. Here they found an old man stretched before a few lighted sticks, and a boy of nine or ten years old pouring water on his head, from a shell which he held in his hand: near them lay a female child dead, and a little farther off, its unfortunate mother: the body of the woman shewed that famine, superadded to disease, had occasioned her death: eruptions covered the poor boy from head to foot; and the old man was so reduced, that he was with difficulty got into the boat. Their situation rendered them incapable of escape, and they quietly submitted to be led away. Arabanoo, contrary to his usual character, seemed at first unwilling to render them any assistance; but his shyness soon wore off, and he treated them with the kindest attention. Nor would he leave the place until he had buried the corpse of the child: that of the woman he did not see from its situation; and as his countrymen did not point it out, the governor ordered that it should not be shewn to him. He scooped a grave in the sand with his hands, of no peculiarity of shape, which he lined completely with grass, and put the body into it, covering it also with grass; and then he filled up the hole, and raised over it a small mound with the earth which had been removed. Here the ceremony ended, unaccompanied by any invocation to a superior being, or any attendant circumstance whence an inference of their religious opinions could be deduced.\\" The old man and the boy were taken to Sydney Cove, where according to Tench, \\"an uninhabited house, near the hospital, was allotted for their reception, and a cradle prepared for each of them. By the encouragement of Arabanoo, who assured them of protection, and the soothing behaviour of our medical gentlemen, they became at once reconciled to us, and looked happy and grateful at the change of their situation. Sickness and hunger had, however, so much exhausted the old man, that little hope was entertained of his recovery. As he pointed frequently to his throat, at the instance of Arabanoo, he tried to wash it with a gargle which was given to him; but the obstructed, tender state of the part rendered it impracticable. B√†do, B√°do (water), was his cry: when brought to him, he drank largely at intervals of it. He was equally importunate for fire, being seized with shivering fits; and one was kindled. Fish were produced, to tempt him to eat; but he turned away his head, with signs of loathing. Nan-bar-ee (the boy), on the contrary, no sooner saw them than he leaped from his cradle, and eagerly seizing them, began to cook them. A warm bath being prepared, they were immersed in it; and after being thoroughly cleansed, they had clean shirts put on them, and were again laid in bed. The old man lived but a few hours. He bore the pangs of dissolution with patient composure; and though he was sensible to the last moment, expired almost without a groan. Nanbaree appeared quite unmoved at the event; and surveyed the corpse of his father without emotion, simply exclaiming, b√≤-ee (dead). This surprised us; as the tenderness and anxiety of the old man about the boy had been very moving. Although barely able to raise his head, while so much strength was left to him, he kept looking into his child's cradle; he patted him gently on the bosom; and, with dying eyes, seemed to recommend him to our humanity and protection. Nanbaree was adopted by Mr. White, surgeon- general of the settlement, and became henceforth one of his family. Arabanoo had no sooner heard of the death of his countryman, than he hastened to inter him. I was present at the ceremony, in company with the governor, captain Ball, and two or three other persons. It differed, by the accounts of those who were present at the funeral of the girl, in no respect from what had passed there in the morning, except that the grave was dug by a convict. But I was informed, that when intelligence of the death reached Arabanoo, he expressed himself with doubt whether he should bury, or burn the body; and seemed solicitous to ascertain which ceremony would be most gratifying to the governor. Indeed, Arabanoo's behaviour, during the whole of the transactions of this day, was so strongly marked by affection to his countryman, and by confidence in us, that the governor resolved to free him from all farther restraint, and at once to trust to his generosity, and the impression which our treatment of him might have made, for his future residence among us: the fetter was accordingly taken off his leg.\\" After only 6 months amongst the settlers, Arabanoo died of smallpox, which he called galgalla, on 18 May 1789. He was buried in the garden of the government building. Colonel David Collins said his death was \\"to the great regret of everyone who had witnessed how little of the savage was found in his manner, and how quickly he was substituting in its place a docile, affable, and truly amiable deportment\\". Tench wrote, \\"I feel assured, that I have no reader who will not join in regretting the premature loss of Arabanoo, who died of the small-pox on the 18th instant, after languishing in it six days. From some imperfect marks and indents on his face, we were inclined to believe that he had passed this dreaded disorder. Even when the first symptoms of sickness seized him, we continued willing to hope that they proceeded from a different cause. But at length the disease burst forth with irresistible fury. It were superfluous to say, that nothing which medical skill and unremitting attention could perform, were left unexerted to mitigate his sufferings, and prolong a life, which humanity and affectionate concern towards his sick compatriots, unfortunately shortened. During his sickness he reposed entire confidence in us. Although a stranger to medicine, and nauseating the taste of it, he swallowed with patient submission innumerable drugs, which the hope of relief induced us to administer to him. The governor, who particularly regarded him, caused him to be buried in his own garden, and attended the funeral in person. The character of Arabanoo, as far as we had developed it, was distinguished by a portion of gravity and steadiness, which our subsequent acquaintance with his countrymen by no means led us to conclude a national characteristic. In that daring, enterprizing frame of mind, which, when combined with genius, constitutes the leader of a horde of savages, or the ruler of a people, boasting the power of discrimination and the resistance of ambition, he was certainly surpassed by some of his successors, who afterwards lived among us. His countenance was thoughtful, but not animated: his fidelity and gratitude, particularly to his friend the governor, were constant and undeviating, and deserve to be recorded. Although of a gentle and placable temper, we early discovered that he was impatient of indignity, and allowed of no superiority on our part. He knew that he was in our power; but the independence of his mind never forsook him. If the slightest insult were offered to him, he would return it with interest. At retaliation of merriment he was often happy; and frequently turned the laugh against his antagonist. He did not want docility; but either from the difficulty of acquiring our language, from the unskilfulness of his teachers, or from some natural defect, his progress in learning it was not equal to what we had expected. For the last three or four weeks of his life, hardly any restraint was laid upon his inclinations: so that had he meditated escape, he might easily have effected it. He was, perhaps, the only native who was ever attached to us from choice; and who did not prefer a precarious subsistence among wilds and precipices, to the comforts of a civilized system.\\" See also *Australian Aboriginal culture *History of Australia *History of Australia (1788‚Äì1850) *History of Indigenous Australians References * Keneally, Tom.
