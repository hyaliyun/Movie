Founded in 1859 by Jews from the Alsace region of France, it is one of the oldest congregations in Louisiana and one of the original founding members of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, now known as the Union for Reform Judaism. History Congregation Gemiluth Chassodim was originally established as the Hebrew Benevolent Society of Rapides Parish in 1852 in order to provide a Jewish Cemetery for burials. One belief for this is that certain families bought a burial ground when a small outbreak of yellow fever claimed six Jewish lives in the early 1850s. Eventually, the society evolved into a congregation in 1859. The first President of the Temple was Isaac Levy. In 1860, the Jewish women of Alexandria assembled to found the Ladies' Hebrew Benevolent Society in order to raise money to buy real estate on which a temple could be built. The Ladies Hebrew Benevolent Society eventually changed its name to the Temple Sisterhood. In 1869, the Temple Sisterhood held a fundraising ball to raise money to build a synagogue at the corner of Third and Fiske Streets. Construction of the temple concluded in 1871. Two years later the congregation joined the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now URJ) and hired Rabbi Marx Klein as its first rabbi. Gemiluth Chassodim experienced great increase in its membership, from 123 families in 1925, to 154 families in 1930 and 203 families in 1945. The \\"Second Temple,\\" which stood as an imposing Greek Revival structure (more than three stories tall) with a dome, unfortunately burned down in 1956. The congregation had already constructed its current Mid- Century modern structure on Turner Street in the early 1950s. Designed by Max Heinberg, it stands as a unique example of Mid-Century modern architecture even to this day. In the early 1960s, the current sanctuary, offices, and classrooms were added. The sanctuary is capable of holding some 350 people at maximum capacity. Thirty-four presidents and 25 rabbis have served the temple. In 2013, Rabbi Harley Karz-Wagman became the twenty-fifth rabbi of the Temple after leaving Mt. Sinai Synagogue in Cheyenne, Wyoming. In 2016, Rabbi Peter Schaktman served the congregation. The congregation hired its first female clergy member since its founding in 1859, Rabbi Cantor Raina Siroty in 2017. Today Congregation Gemiluth Chassodim remains an active part of the Greater Alexandria community. It serves as a regional synagogue drawing in members from such neighboring communities as: Natchitoches, Leesville, Natchez, Winnfield, and Fort Polk. Its current membership consists of approximately 120 member families with a religious school of 30 students. Its previous two rabbis, Martin Hinchin and Arnold Task served a combined 52 years in their service to the congregation. Shabbat services are held weekly on Friday evenings and Saturday mornings. The Temple actively hosts numerous guest speakers, concerts, and cultural events for the Jewish and non-Jewish communities of Alexandria.

The adaptation was first broadcast on British television over the Christmas period in 2011. Anderson's casting as Miss Havisham drew attention to the production due to her being a mere 43 compared to other actresses who have played her. However, critical reception was generally positive. In 2012, the PBS broadcast earned the series a total of four Creative Arts Emmy Awards out of five nominations for Outstanding Art Direction, Cinematography, Costumes, and Main Title Design. The remaining nomination was for Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music. Plot Part one Young Pip (Oscar Kennedy) is out on the marshes when he meets escaped convict Abel Magwitch (Ray Winstone), who tells him to steal a file so he can remove his shackles. Pip returns, bringing a mutton pie with him along with the file, much to Magwitch‚Äôs amazement. Later, Magwitch is re- arrested while fighting with a mysterious fellow escapee (Paul Rhys). Pip lives with his sister (Claire Rushbrook) and the blacksmith Joe Gargery (Shaun Dooley), who learn from her uncle (Mark Addy) that the reclusive Miss Havisham (Gillian Anderson) needs a young boy. Sure of a reward, Pip‚Äôs sister puts him forward, and he becomes a playmate for Havisham's adopted daughter Estella (Izzy Meikle-Small). During his time at the house, Pip becomes convinced that she will become his benefactor and is disappointed when she signs a contract paying for Pip's blacksmith apprenticeship to Joe, even more so when Havisham tells him never to return to see her. While he and Joe are at the house, Pip‚Äôs sister is attacked by the evil Orlick (Jack Roth), leaving her bedridden as Pip begins his seven-year apprenticeship. Seven years later, Pip (now Douglas Booth), having once again seen Estella (now Vanessa Kirby), is visited by the lawyer Jaggers (David Suchet), who informs him that he has an anonymous benefactor who will pay for him to go to London and begin life as a gentleman, on the condition that he must be known only as Pip and must not enquire about the source of the money. Assuming the benefactor to be Havisham, he visits her and promises not to let her down. Part two In London, grown up Pip spends time in the company of Herbert Pocket (Harry Lloyd), racking up debts at a private members club and trying to forget his former life. Pip tells Herbert of his love for Estella but Pocket is wary. He warns Pip that no one knows where Estella came from, that Havisham adopted her from nowhere and from 'friends' no one had ever heard of. Pip, however, chaperones Estella in London, accompanying her to a ball and his feelings grow stronger. At Jaggers' offices Pip is berated for his debts, but Pip insists he must impress Havisham to show he is a gentleman. Pip overhears an arrogant client, Bentley Drummle (Tom Burke), also being told off by Jaggers for his ways. Pip attempts to befriend him, but at a dance Drummle shows attention to Estella and taunts Pip, saying he knows he is not a true gentleman. Jaggers' clerk Wemmick also shows disdain for Pip's background but assists Pip in secretly funding Pocket's new business, which allows Pocket to marry the girl he was thrown out of his family for. Pip attends his sister‚Äôs funeral. Alone in his room, Pip awakens to find the convict Magwitch tipping money out of a sack, before revealing himself to be Pip's mysterious benefactor. Part three Pocket stumbles in and after being threatened with a knife to his throat by Magwitch, learns of all. Pip is wary of Magwitch, believing the money must have come from murder. He visits Havisham, meeting Drummle there who gloats telling him of his engagement to Estella. Estella reveals that Pip was brought to the house to be a boy to practise breaking hearts on. After Estella leaves, Pip demands that Havisham explain why she led him on to believe she was his benefactor and that he was meant for Estella. Havisham tells him that Estella is going to break Drummle's heart, but Pip says that Drummle will not care what Estella does. Pocket finds a place for Magwitch to hide with the help of Wemmick. They discover a large sum of money has been offered by a gentleman from Pip's club for whoever turns in Magwitch. Pip describes him to Magwitch, who reveals his real name to be Compeyson, the man he fought with on the marshes years ago. Pocket and Pip realise Compeyson is the same man who jilted Havisham. Magwitch assures Pip that the money came from working with sheep, not murder. Pip tells him he has turned his back on his family. Estella has married Drummle and letters from home are returned unopened to Havisham. Pip, unwilling to accept Magwitch's money, realises that Pocket's new business is in danger so he goes to Havisham for money. Reluctantly she gives it to him, then asks and receives his forgiveness. While burning old love letters from Compeyson, she is caught up in the flames and burns to death; Pip turns back but is too late to save her. Magwitch reveals that he was married to a woman called Molly and they had a daughter, but when he went away for work their associate Compeyson tried to rape her, and Molly fought him off. Compeyson reported Molly for attempted murder and she was put in jail. Magwitch returned to find his wife in jail and was told of his daughter's death. Though his wife was spared hanging by Jaggers, Magwitch began drinking and fell into crime. He ended up arrested for a crime both he and Compeyson had committed; Compeyson received two years and Magwitch life. Pocket and Wemmick find a trustworthy ship to sail Magwitch away from London, and Pip decides to go with him. Orlick discovers Pip's association with Magwitch and tells Compeyson. Orlick attacks Pip, yet Pip overpowers him and leaves for the ship. As they row towards the ship, Compeyson and guards approach on another boat; Magwitch stabs Compeyson to death, but is severely beaten by the guards before being taken to prison to await hanging. Pip goes to Jaggers and, seeing his servant girl Molly, realises she is Magwitch's Molly, and after freeing her from jail Jaggers took her on as his servant. He also realises that Estella was Molly's and Magwitch's daughter. Pip goes to Magwitch on his deathbed and tells him that his daughter is alive and loved before Magwitch dies. Estella marries Drummle who, after repeatedly abusing his horse, is kicked to death by it, freeing Estella, who also shows signs of his abuse with bruised shoulders. She becomes the inheriter of Havisham's and Drummle's estates. Pip, still in one pound's worth of debt to his collectors, intends to leave London, but Wemmick informs him that it has been paid by Joe, whom he had written to asking for help. Pip returns home and begs and receives Joe's forgiveness. Pip goes to Havisham's house where he finds Estella. The pair share a tender scene in the drive.

The interior scenes of Satis House were filmed on location in Langleybury Mansion, a former country house and estate near Watford, Hertfordshire. The Gargery House/Forge was built on marshland to the east of the Essex village of Tollesbury, whilst the village church seen in the opening scenes of the series was the St Thomas a Beckett church, located in the deserted Kent village of Fairfield on the Romney Marsh. Reception In the UK the first part of the adaptation received the highest viewing figures in its time slot, gaining 6.6 million viewers. Casting The casting of Gillian Anderson as the obsessive jilted bride Miss Havisham drew attention to the production due to her being a mere 43 compared to other actresses who have played her. The move was generally accepted with The Independent saying \\"Phelps's biggest liberty, making Miss Havisham young and beautiful... didn't greatly worry me, because Gillian Anderson nicely captured the continuing hysteria of her obsession.\\" The Guardian said that \\"some people have been moaning that Gillian Anderson isn't old enough to be Miss Havisham, that she's a cougar rather than a crone, too ravishing for Havisham. She's not that ravishing, though. They've done a pretty good job of ageing and witchifying her. And, more importantly, she feels like Miss Havisham\\". The Daily Telegraph also praised her saying \\"this pale yet still beautiful wraith, mouth in need of lip salve and Baby Jane ringlets slowly unravelling, speaking in insidious singsong instead of the usual dotty dowager tones. This was a Miss Havisham who has never really grown up.\\" The Telegraph also pointed out that Anderson is only a little younger than the generally considered definitive version of Miss Havisham as played by Martita Hunt in the David Lean version, a point that Anderson herself made on The Graham Norton Show.

It is about northeast of Lake Naivasha, which is visible from the summit. Wildlife includes Colobus and Sykes monkeys, elephants and buffalo and abundant birdlife. The name of the mountain means \\"butterfly\\" in the Gikuyu language, a reference to its profile from a distance. The Mount Kipipiri Forest Reserve is part of the Aberdare National Park. In 2005 it was estimated that the forest reserve was home to about 13 elephants. In June 2009 lengthy negotiations were concluded over the alignment of a wildlife corridor between Kipipiri and the main Aberdare park, with plans to fence the corridor. Grids of rolling bars with gaps between them replace the fence at the points where roads cross the corridor, forming an obstacle that cars can cross but that wildlife will not attempt. This keeps the wildlife, particularly elephants, away from farmers' fields.

() The archives hold the records of the office of the President and most government ministries. They are currently participating in the Digital Library of the Caribbean's Protecting Haitian Patrimony Initiative.\\"Digital Library of the Caribbean,\\" http://dloc.com/ianh History The Archives Nationales d'Haiti (ANH) were created by a Presidential Decree on August 20, 1860. The Decree occurred under the government of Fabre Geffrard (1859-1867). The Decree established the \\"General Archives of Finances\\" which were the Republic of Haiti's first formal and official archives. Although the government had at an early time legislated on the issue of Archives, after Geffrard the institution was never granted the attention it deserved. From 1868 to 1921, the Archives was abandoned. This included the Celebration of the first Centennial of Independence in 1904. In 1922, the archives repository was moved to a premise which was initially built in 1905 to shelter a public market. While the new location addressed the problem of insufficient space, it did not improve upon the poor conservation conditions which had resulted in the loss of a large number of documents. 19 years passed before a Decree Law issued on October 20, 1941, changed the \\"Service in charge of the State's Archives\\" into the \\"National Archives.\\"http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00083680/00001/pdf The administrative context of the ANH changed several times over the last half of the 20th century, impacting its direction and the allocation of its resources. Between 1941 and 1975, a series of Decrees transferred the responsibility for the ANH from the Ministry of Finances to the Ministry of National Education (1961) to the Ministry of Justice (1974), where it remained until 1983. In an address delivered at the Seminar on the Acquisition of Latin American Library Materials in 2006, ANH Director Jean Wilfrid Bertrand described the institution's tenure under the Ministry of Justice as \\"its last dark years,\\" wherein the ANH \\"was reduced to its merest expression\\" (certified translation). During this period, the Historical Archives repository was removed from the ANH and returned to the Central Office. In 1983, Jean Wilfrid Bertrand was named the Director General of the ANH; he continues to hold the position to the present day. A Decree in 1986 established the ANH as an autonomous part of the Haitian government, and moved it under the administrative care of the Minister of Information and Public Relations in 1986 and then under the Minister of Culture and Communication.  Mission Statement  The Mission Statement for the National Archives of Haiti is to collect several types of documents including vital records, and financial, legal or administrative documents created by the Haitian government. The purpose of this is to create transparency in the view of the Haitian government and to inspire confidence in the rights of the government.  Effect of the 2010 earthquake  Prior to the earthquake of 2010, the Director Jean Wilfrid Bertrand has said that items in the archive were already damaged, destroyed or poorly housed. These items included civil registrations, and papers from the President, Ministries and Parliament. He has said that \\"since the earthquake, the situation is worse\\". In the meantime, he is working with the International Association of Francophone Archives (Association Internationale des Archives Francophone) who have been providing guidance since the earthquake. The Protecting Haitian Patrimony Initiative has worked to preserve the materials in the National Archives and other cultural heritage institutions by providing money, archival supplies, and help coordinating the assistance .  ¬´Annexe 3¬ª and Digital Archiving  Part of the purpose of the National Archives of Haiti is to provide birth, death and marriage records (vital records). A new program started in February 2018 helps provide these documents electronically to citizens. ¬´Annexe 3¬ª is the section that is working to digitize and distribute these records, supplying them to patrons as soon as they are requested. They are doing this by digitizing all of the registers from 1793 until the modern day. ANH hopes that this will help eliminate the documentation problems of Haitian citizens, such as fraudulent documents, the existence of multiple birth certificates, and late declarations. The Managing director of ANH in 2018 observed that 3 million Haitian citizens do not have their birth certificates and the purpose of this project is to help them prove their identity; as Jean Wilfrid Bertrand has remarked, one quarter of the population does not officially exist because they are not registered. This vital research is aided by category-specific informational documents that can be downloaded off of the ANH website.  Legacy of Colonialism  Though Haiti was one of the first colonies in the Americas to declare its independence, the enduring effects of French colonial rule over its national archives are apparent in the dispersion of archival materials outside of Haiti, the political and economic milieus which have dictated the historical development of the ANH, and the language in which much of Haiti's documentary heritage has been recorded. ANH Director Jean Wilfrid Bertrand has commented: ‚ÄúThe Caribbean‚Äôs colonial past has weighed and still weighs heavily on the region‚Äôs future.‚Äù While the ANH possesses some holdings from their colonial era, such as registers of vital statistics, many more historical records central to Haiti's documentary heritage are held by the national archives of France and their trading partners, such as Spain and Britain. For example, no original or official copies of Haiti's Declaration of Independence were known to exist until 2010, when one was located by Julia Gaffield - a doctoral student at the time - in The National Archives (UK).

He is considered one of the most important religious/political leaders of the time, specifically because he preached tolerance and understanding. Biography The name \\"Antes\\" is sometimes said to be a Greek paraphrase of the German \\"Blume\\" (anthos), adopted as a disguise during persecutions of 1620. It is more likely that the last name is a shortened form of the name \\"Antonius.\\" Henry Antes emigrated with his father's family to Pennsylvania Colony about 1720, and built a paper mill on the Wissahickon near Philadelphia. He partnered with William DeWees to establish the second paper mill in the nation, and later married DeWees's daughter, Christina DeWees. His brother in law was William DeWees, who owned Valley Forge, Pennsylvania during Washington's encampment during the winter of 1777. He was also to related David Rittenhouse, who was his wife's aunt Wilhelmina DeWees Rittenhouse's grandson. Antes built and designed his home and his own a paper mill in 1736 on the Wissahickon in present-day Upper Frederick Township Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. His home, Henry Antes House, is recognized as one of the first interracial and nonsectarian boys schools in Pennsylvania and possibly in America. The school was called the Frederickstown School and educated as many as 34 boys at one point including a Black from St. Thomas, West Indies and a Mohegan Indian. Upon invitation of Antes's son Colonel Frederick Antes, George Washington and his troops stayed at Henry Antes house from September 23 to 26, 1777, during the Philadelphia Campaign. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1992. It is now the owned by the Goshenhoppen Historians, Inc. Here he married Christina, daughter of William Dewees, and became a leader in the civil and religious affairs of the colony. He was the friend of Whitefield and Zinzendorf, and, after consultation with the latter, assumed the leadership of the religious organization founded in 1741, and known as \\"Unitas Fratrum,\\" or Moravian Church. Antes was one of the founders of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He signed the deed for Bethlehem on April 2, 1741, conveying 500 acres along the Monocacy Creek from William Allen, the founder of Allentown, Pennsylvania. The original deed of the town of Bethlehem is held in a temperature and humidity controlled vault in the Moravian Archives in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Antes became the business manager for the Moravian colony and engineered the building of mills, buildings and other works. The legal care of the communities property and temporal affairs were placed in his hands. a trusted counsellor skilled in the drawing of legal documents. He served as \\"Baumeister\\" (\\"Construction Manager\\") of the first buildings which still stand in Bethlehem's historic district. Antes became the chief architect and builder for the Moravian Church having been involved in nearly all of the building activity in the various Moravian settlements. He engineered the building of the first mill on the Monocacy in 1743, the Single Brethren House, and the Sisters House in 1744, the Bell House in 1748 and its two additions in 1748 and 1749, the Brethren House or Colonial Hall in 1748, the Crown Inn, and numerous mills and industrial buildings. When the Moravians established the first ferry crossing the Lehigh River, the enterprise was called Henry Antes in his honor. In 1745 the Governor appointed him Justice of the Peace for Northampton County and in 1752 Justice of the Peace for Philadelphia County. In 1752 he purchased 100,000 acre tract on behalf of the Moravians in North Carolina for their colony of Wachovia. Descendants His son Philip Frederick (or just Frederick) Antes (born 2 July 1730; died in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, 20 September 1801) held political and military offices, and was a judge of the court of common pleas. During the American Revolution, British General William Howe put a bounty on his head for 200 pounds. In 1776, in company with a Mr. Potts at Warwick furnace, he successfully cast an 18-pound cannon, the first cannon ever made in America. A friend of George Washington's, Frederick invited Washington and his troops to stay at Henry Antes house from September 23 to 26, 1777, during the Philadelphia Campaign.Benjamin Henry Latrobe's drawings for porticoes to the white houseLt Colonel John Henry Antes was his son and founder and defender of Fort Antes, Pennsylvania. His fort played a major rule in the Revolutionary War specifically the Big Runaway where Colonel Samuel Hunter ordered the evacuation of the area surrounding Forts Antes and Augusta. He served as a Justice of the Peace from July 29, 1775, until January 24, 1776, of Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. Henry's daughter, Anna Catherina, joined the Moravian Church, married a physician and moved to what is now Old Salem, North Carolina. John Antes (1740‚Äì1811) was his son and the first American Moravian Missionary to travel and work in Egypt, one of the earliest American- born chamber music composers, and the maker of perhaps the earliest surviving bowed string instrument made in America.

The technique was introduced by Ravishankar and Goodman in 1983. Such caches are used in systems where many processors or computers share the same memory and each has its own cache. In such systems processor 'A' may read a value from memory, then processor 'B' does the same. If either of the processors now change the value by writing back to memory they will invalidate the other processor's cached value. In order to prevent this and maintain cache coherence, snoopy caches monitor ('snoop on') the memory bus to detect any writes to values that they are holding, including changes coming from other processors or distributed computers. However, this approach can only work in computer architectures like SGI Challenge and SGI Onyx where a single memory bus is shared between all processors.

Bordered roughly by Elm Avenue, Broadway, Eisenhower Drive, Hollywood Avenue, and the borough's boundary line, this district encompasses 2,632 contributing buildings, four contributing sites, three contributing structures, and one contributing object (The Picket) in the central business district and surrounding residential area of Hanover. Note: This includes It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. History The community of Hanover, Pennsylvania had its beginnings in a grant of of land by Charles Calvert, the fourth Lord Baltimore to the Irish nobleman and Maryland resident John Digges in 1727. Named Digges Choice at the time, the name was changed to the Conewago Settlement in 1730 when Catholic settlers from Pennsylvania and Maryland began relocating there in increasing numbers. Richard McAllister then purchased, in 1745, the specific area of heavily forested land where the original town of Hanover would later be built. After clearing a portion of the land, he erected a log home, store and tavern at what would eventually become the corner of Baltimore and Middle Streets. He then officially founded the town of Hanover in 1763. The town's name was reportedly suggested by Hannover, Germany native Michael Tanner, a commissioner who had helped plan York County's configuration in 1749. While en route between his home in Monticello, Virginia to Philadelphia to participate in the first session of the Continental Congress where he would, in short order, draft the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson stopped on April 12, 1776 in Hanover, where he spent the evening at the Sign of the Horse inn on Frederick Street which was owned by Caspar Reinecker. Jefferson then also spent the evening there on September 5, 1776, while en route on his return home. At this time, the town had roughly 500 primarily log-style residences.Jackson, Matthew. \\"Give Hanover its historic due: Jefferson stopped there en route to write the Declaration.\\" York, Pennsylvania: York Daily Record, March 5, 2019. This community also played a role in the War of 1812, enrolling two infantry companies which helped halt the advance of British troops on Baltimore in 1814 during and after the Battle of North Point. In 1852, further growth of the community was facilitated by construction of the Hanover Branch Railroad to Hanover Junction, Pennsylvania, followed by the 1858 opening of the Gettysburg Railroad, which extended travel capabilities west toward Gettysburg. The Hanover and York Railroad then extended travel even further by opening a link to York in 1876. On June 30, 1863, Hanover became the site of the final encounter between the Union and Confederate States armies before they fought against each other in July's three-day Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War.Parks, \\"How the Pennsylvania Dutch Turned a Rural Town into a Snack Food Empire,\\" NPR.

Stupp (b. Jan. 9, 1951 in San Jos√©, Costa Rica), is a Board of Trustees Professor of Materials Science, Chemistry, and Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago, IL. He is best known for his work on self- assembling materials and supramolecular chemistry. One of his most notable discoveries is a broad class of peptide amphiphiles that self-assemble into high aspect ratio nanofibers with extensive applications in regenerative medicine. He has also made significant contributions to the fields of supramolecular chemistry, nanotechnology, and organic electronic materials. He has over 300 peer-reviewed publications and was one of the 100 most cited chemists in the 2000-2010 decade. Education and academic career Early life and education Stupp was born in San Jos√©, Costa Rica, the son of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. He attended high school at Liceo de Costa Rica, and in 1968 came to the United States to attend UCLA, where he graduated with a BS in chemistry in 1972. He subsequently went to Northwestern University and earned a PhD under Stephen Carr in 1977, studying the molecular origins of electrical polarization in polymers. Research at UIUC Stupp began his independent research career in 1977 as an assistant professor at Northwestern University, but after three years moved to UIUC where he held appointments in Materials Science and Engineering, Chemistry and Bioengineering. At UIUC his research focused on materials chemistry and self- assembly. Research at Northwestern In 1999, Stupp returned to Northwestern University as a Board of Trustees Professor of Materials Science, Chemistry, and Medicine. In 2000 he was also appointed the Director of the newly formed Institute for BioNanotechnology in Medicine (IBNAM) at Northwestern‚Äôs medical school campus in downtown Chicago. One of Stupp‚Äôs major discoveries occurred soon after his arrival at Northwestern. In 2001, Stupp and postdoctoral fellow Jeffrey Hartgerink discovered a new class of peptide amphiphiles with the ability to self-assemble into nanoscale filaments that mimic components of the extracellular matrix. Consisting of a hydrophobic alkyl tail grafted onto specially designed peptide sequences, these peptide amphiphiles spontaneously form high-aspect ratio nanofibers in water that can present extremely high densities of biological signals on their surface. These molecules have revolutionized the field of bioactive materials for regenerative medicine, with potential applications in bone and cartilage regeneration, angiogenesis for ischemia or peripheral artery disease, cancer therapy, novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, stem cell differentiation, spinal cord injury, diabetes, and many other areas. In addition, Stupp‚Äôs laboratory is pursuing fundamental research on hierarchical self-assembly, novel materials for solar energy, and self-assembling catalytic systems. Professional achievements Stupp has published over 300 papers in highly respected peer-reviewed scientific journals such as Science, Nature, Journal of the American Chemical Society, and PNAS. He holds over 20 patents, and has started a company, Nanotope, to commercialize his group‚Äôs peptide amphiphile technology. Stupp was also listed by Thomson Reuters as one of the top 100 most cited chemists of the 2000-2010 decade.http://www.sciencewatch.com/dr/sci/misc/Top100Chemists2000-10/ He has mentored hundreds of graduate students and postdocs throughout the course of his career. Stupp has won numerous awards over the course of his career, including the Department of Energy Prize for Outstanding Scientific Accomplishment in Materials Chemistry, the Humboldt Award for Senior U.S. Scientists, the Materials Research Society Medal Award and the American Chemical Society Award in Polymer Chemistry. He is a fellow of several professional societies including the Materials Research Society, the World Biomaterials Congress, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Physical Society. He holds an honorary degree and a distinguished professorship from the Eindhoven University of Technology and an honorary degree from the National University of Costa Rica. He has been a visiting professor at the University of Strasbourg (guest of Jean-Marie Lehn) and held the Juliot Curie Professorship at √âcole Superieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles (guest of late Pierre-Gilles de Gennes) and the Merck- Karl Pfister Visiting Pressorship in Organic Chemistry at MIT. He has served on numerous scientific advisory boards in the US and Europe and is also a member of multiple scientific journal editorial boards. Most recently, on February 9, 2012, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering. In 2001 he chaired the first review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative at the request of the White House Economic Council and the National Academy of Engineering. He gave one of the plenary lectures at the 2012 spring meeting of the American Chemical Society on the subject of ‚ÄúChemistry for Regenerative Medicine‚Äù, and was awarded the 2013 Ronald Breslow Award for Achievement in Biomimetic Chemistry by the ACS.

It takes its name from Kinangop Mountain, which rises in the Aberdares to the east. Geographical features The edge of the plateau is about in elevation. The plateau is relatively flat, sloping gradually upwards towards the foothills of the Aberdares. Rainfall is around annually, with more rainfall in the north than the south. Streams that feed the Malewa and Karati rivers have cut into the plateau. These rivers in turn flow into Lake Naivasha. Soils include ando‚Äêluvic and verto‚Äêluvic phaeozems. At one time the plateau was almost completely covered in tussocky grassland with very few trees. The stream valleys had many tussocky bogs. Colonial era After a railway was built, in the 1920s to 1940s the Wanjohi Valley became a British settler community that gained notoriety as the \\"Happy Valley set\\". The immigrants bought land at low cost to raise sheep and cattle. Idina Sackville, a member of this set, bought a plot on the side of the Kipipiri Mountain, which rises above the plateau, building a house called \\"Clouds\\" that became notorious for parties involving drug use and promiscuous sex. Josslyn Hay, a member of this set, was shot dead in 1941. During the Mau Mau emergency between 1952 and 1960, huge areas of the \\"White Highlands\\" were designated prohibited or restricted to non-Europeans. The Aberdares, Kinangop plateau and Mount Kipipiri were among these. Any African found in the area could legally be shot on sight. Their presence justified \\"reasonable suspicion\\" that they were terrorists. Today The plateau has been settled by Kikuyu farmers since the 1960s. They have ploughed much of the land to grow maize, wheat, cabbage and potatoes. They have replaced the tussocks by grasses that are easier for livestock to eat, and have planted woodlots across the plateau. The wetlands have mostly been drained. Where drainage has not been deliberate, the trees planted for poles and firewood have absorbed the water. Farm lots are being broken up to be divided between family members. The trend is away from animal husbandry and towards more intensive cultivation of food crops and cash crops. Mount Kipipiri is a cone-shaped extinct volcano that rises from the plateau in the north. It is part of the Aberdare National Park. The mountain is completely ringed by an electric fence. In June 2009 lengthy negotiations were concluded over the alignment of a wildlife corridor between Kipipiri and the main Aberdare park, with plans to fence the corridor. Grids of rolling bars with gaps between them replace the fence at the points where roads cross the corridor, forming an obstacle that cars can cross but that wildlife will not attempt. This keeps the wildlife, particularly elephants, away from farmers' fields.

Dubois reveals that the alien beings are \\"Diaphanoids\\" from the Andromeda Galaxy and need humans as host bodies. Halstead and his team are forced to watch a \\"hosting\\" ceremony which results in several more deaths. They rescue a pair of female station crew and start a melee with their captors. Opening an outer wall panel, they escape across the surface of Mars to a nearby spacecraft, as the air is expelled, killing all inside the base. The U.D. fleet arrives to bomb the base, but Halstead's ship can't liftoff on its own. Unwilling to let the Diaphanoids escape, Halstead demands the fleet drop its bombs, even though it will almost certainly kill him too.

It is the most divergent member of the Palaungic branch (Sidwell 2010). Danau is spoken by about 5,000 people near Aungban, Kalaw Township, Shan State. Danaw was classified as a \\"critically endangered\\" language in UNESCO's 2010 Atlas of the World‚Äôs Languages in Danger. Danau is the Burmese pronunciation of the ethnonym; the Danau themselves pronounce the name of their ethnic group and language as . An common variant is . Danau is a tonal language with four tones according to some sources, while others, including native speakers, identify three tones.Si, Aung (2014) Danau. In: The Handbook of Austroasiatic Languages. M. Jenny & P. Sidwell (eds.). pp. 1104-1141. Brill, Leiden. The Danau are a little known ethnic group in Myanmar, and even in the nearby town of Aungban, it is common for people to confuse this group with the local Danu majority. According to historical accounts, the Danu had served as archers for King Alaungpaya, who founded the Konbaung Dynasty in the 18th century. The Danu settled in the Pindaya region after returning from wars in Thailand,http://asiaharvest.org/wp-content/themes/asia/docs/people- groups/Myanmar/Danau.pdf and speak a variant of Burmese that is characterised by minor differences in pronunciation. The Danau, on the other hand speak a completely different Austroasiatic language, which nevertheless has numerous words borrowed from Burmese (and also ultimately from Pali via Burmese). The Danau live primarily in the villages of Taungbohla, Thaethit, Htinyugon, Chaunggya and Naung In, within a short distance of the towns of Aungban and Heho. As these villages are surrounded by Pa'O villages, Danau people tend to speak Pa'O as well as Burmese. In spite of the small size of the Danau- speaking population, the language is vigorous and being taught to children. The current situation is in contrast to the prediction made by the linguist Gordon H. Luce in 1965, when he called Danau a 'dying' language. The Danau people are primarily farmers, growing sesame, turmeric, ginger, chilli, groundnut and potato for local consumption and for sale at nearby markets.

The label also encourages many new artists. Val√©ry Zeitoun (already a judge in the French television reality series Popstars in its second season in 2002) famously ran a campaign in 2010 on Facebook entitled Je veux signer chez AZ (meaning I want to sign with AZ). Two candidates were selected to join the label, namely Victor Le Douarec and M√©lissa Nkonda. The campaign was so popular, Zeitoun ran a second series of casting for talent in 2011 resulting in signing of a third new artist, namely Alias Hilsum. Val√©ry Zeitoun also appeared in film Backstage directed by Emmanuelle Bercot where he plays the role of manager of the singer Lauren Marks (played by Emmanuelle Seigner). He continued to run the label until October 2011, but resigned from Universal Music France and AZ to consecrate himself to other projects.

Later that same year, her husband was summoned for military duty in the Colonial War, in the then-Portuguese Overseas Province of Mozambique, and Maria Cavaco Silva accompanied him. She lived in Louren√ßo Marques (modern-day Maputo), where she taught Portuguese language and foreign languages at Liceu Salazar and Liceu D. Ana da Costa Portugal. In 1971, they both moved to York, in England, while her husband studied Economics in the University of York. Once there, Maria Cavaco Silva attended German and Italian courses at the Language Teaching Centre, and taught Portuguese privately to foreigners. Simultaneously, she enjoyed the opportunity to deepen her knowledge of English culture and language. The Cavaco Silvas returned to Portugal in 1974. In 1977, Maria became a lecturer of Portuguese language of the Philosophy course at the Catholic University, in Lisbon. Starting in 1981, she taught the same subject in the Theology course, and the Portuguese Language and Culture subject of the Law course of the Faculty of Human Sciences of that University. Still in this Faculty, she headed, in July/August 1985, the Luso-American summer course about \\"The Portuguese Language in Contemporary Portuguese Novels\\". She then began teaching the Annual Portuguese Course for Foreigners, in the Socrates/Erasmus programme, which she led until 2006. Today, she is still connected to that University, and occasionally gives lectures on Literature and Portuguese Culture. She was teaching there during her husband's term as Prime Minister of Portugal (from 1985 to 1995) On 22 January 2006, her husband was elected President of Portugal, with 50,6% of the votes. She became the First Lady of Portugal, succeeding Maria Jos√© Ritta, Jorge Sampaio's wife, in March of that year. Her activity agenda included the challenges that families and the youth face in today's world, or the new demands in social assistance. As it had already happened in the 1980s and the 1990s, when her husband was Prime Minister, attending official acts and institutional events, as well as contacting with organisations, associations and several entities of the civil society, is a large part of her daily routine. The couple currently has two children and five grandchildren.

Family life His father, a civil engineer, was Karl Heinrich Klinksik; his mother was Gertrud Emma Mathilde (n√©e) Uhlendahl. He was first married from 1936 to 1945 to the actress Hildegard Wolf with whom he had one child. There were two more children from his second marriage in 1950 to Karin Anderson, another actress.

Education and career Paul Klinger and Nadia Gray; 2007 stamp based on the poster to the 1956 film Hengst Maestoso Austria Klinger's secondary education was at the Helmholtz-Realgymnasium, which he attended to Abitur level taking part in amateur dramatic productions with his friend, Helmut K√§utner. However, his father was opposed to any idea of a career in the theatre and sent him to the Technische Hochschule M√ºnchen (Technical University Munich), where he once again met up with his old school friend Helmut K√§utner. The latter persuaded him to change from architecture to a theatrical course. He completed six semesters, he and his friend working as extras at the Otto-Falckenberg Schauspielhaus. The death of his father meant that he could no longer afford to study and he accordingly decided to become a professional actor. Theatre One of his first engagements was at the Bayerische Landesb√ºhne (a travelling theatre) ‚Äì and from 1929 at theatres in Koblenz, Oldenburg, D√ºsseldorf and Breslau ‚Äì where his powerful and distinctive voice landed him major parts for which he was really too young. Things were to change in 1933 when the director Heinz Hilpert took him to the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, where he was cast in the roles of young heroes, as was the case with a production of Uta von Naumberg in which he appeared with K√§the Dorsch. He would remain in theatre in Berlin until 1948, appearing not only at the Deutsches Theater but also at the Komische Oper, the Theater am Kurf√ºrstendamm, the Hebbeltheater, the Schlo√üpark-Theater and in comedy. Early films In Breslau, under the direction of his cousin, Karl-Heinz Uhlendahl, he passed some television screen tests and began his film career in 1933 with Du sollst nicht begehren (Thou Shalt not Covet), which landed him simultaneous contracts with the then biggest German studios Ufa, Terra Film and Tobis. His second film was M√§nner vor der Ehe in 1936, this to be followed by numerous roles in other films. As for his film work during the period of the Third Reich, the theatrical director Hellmuth Matiasek commented: \\"His appearance and manner ‚Äì evoking pre-war salons rather than the trenches of the Eastern Front ‚Äì spared him from productions commissioned by Joseph Goebbels and he played in classics by Goethe, Theodor Storm and Fontane.\\" A short film made early in the war, Barbara, did not get past the censor: in this he played the soldier husband of Lotte Werkmeister. However, when he was sent to the front, his wife would find fulfilment with a job on the railway. In the NS- inspired war film, Sp√§htrupp Hallgarten, directed by Herbert B Fredersdorf, Klinger comes across as boyish, eye-winking and at times foolhardy. Post war films He had other film parts after the Second World War, reaching the peak of his popularity in the 1950s in films of Erich K√§stner novels such as Anna Louise and Anton and The Flying Classroom, as well as others in the Heimatfilm genre of the Immenhof trilogy. In the latter, Klinger, in the role of Jochen von Roth, is an amiable, substitute father-figure who manages to turn the impoverished farm into a successful pony-trekking centre. Dubbing As early as 1943, Klinger was involved in film dubbing. In the 1950s and 60s he was one of the busiest dubbing actors in the German film industry, speaking the parts of many well known actors including Charlton Heston, Bing Crosby (12 times), Jean Gabin, Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart, Stewart Granger, William Holden and Tyrone Power. TV and radio From the early 1960s, he was seen less frequently on the big screen but embarked on a television career where he became known to a wide audience in the six-part WDR blockbuster, ' by Francis Durbridge, and the ZDF police series, Kommissar Brahm. In addition to his work for theatre, film and television, Klinger appeared from 1940 onwards in numerous German radio dramas. In 1967 he took over the title role, which had been played by Ren√© Deltgen, in the twelfth and final episode of the famous Paul Temple radio series, Paul Temple und der Fall Alex (Paul Temple and the Alex Affair) by Francis Durbridge. Like almost all the other broadcasts in the series, this WDR production was released on a CD. In the eleventh episode (1966) Paul Temple und der Fall Genf(Paul Temple and the Geneva Mystery), he was heard not in the title role but as Maurice Lonsdale. Death and honours Paul Klinger, who appeared in over 70 films, died in Munich on 14 November 1971 from a heart attack while he was attending a meeting of the Bundesfachgruppe der Film- und Fernsehschaffenden of the Deutsche Angestellten-Gewerkschaft.Film and TV Professionals of the German Salaried Employees' Union He is buried in the cemetery at S√∂cking near Starnberg. In 1974, the non-profit association ‚ÄòPaul-Klinger- K√ºnstlersozialwerk e.V.‚Äô (Paul Klinger Artist Welfare-Aid Foundation) was founded to honour his work for disadvantaged artists. On the anniversary of his birth in 2007, Germany honoured Paul Klinger with a commemorative postage stamp that had a print-run of ten million. The stamp was launched at a ceremony on 14 June 2007 by the Paul-Klinger-K√ºnstlersozialwerkes e.V. at H√∂henried Castle on Lake Starnberg in the presence of his family and former colleagues, the latter including Sonja Ziemann, Ernst Stankovski, Kurt Weinzierl, Mady Rahl und Eva-Ingeborg Scholz. A road is named after him in his birthplace, Essen. It is located in the Essen-Westviertel district, close to the Colosseum Theatre on land where once stood factory premises of the firm Friedrich Krupp AG.

Herrick was the son of John Heyrick of Leicester and was baptised on 9 December 1562. His father was an ironmonger at Leicester. He was sent to London in about 1574 to be apprenticed to his elder brother Nicholas Herrick, a goldsmith in Cheapside. After six years he set up a business on his own in Wood Street on premises leased from the Goldsmith's Company. He also became a moneylender and in a few years he had made himself a fortune and was able to purchase Beau Manor Park from the Earl of Essex, and obtained a right to arms. He came to the notice of Queen Elizabeth, who sent him on a mission to the Ottoman Porte and on his return he was rewarded with a lucrative appointment in the Exchequer. He was made a freeman of Leicester in 1601 when he presented the corporation with a dozen silver spoons in lieu of a fee. In 1601, Herrick was elected Member of Parliament for Leicester. He became principal jeweller to King James, Anne of Denmark and Prince Henry in 1603 and held the post until 1625. Herrick and John Spilman repaired some of the crown jewels for the coronation of James and Anne of Denmark.Henry Paton, HMC Laing Manuscripts at the University of Edinburgh, vol. 1 (London, 1914), pp. 93-6. On 12 January 1604 Herrick and Spilman were asked to assess and make an inventory of jewels that had belonged to Queen Elizabeth. James had already given many pieces to the queen, Princess Elizabeth, and Arbella Stuart and others. The remaining jewels had been transferred from the keeping of Mrs Mary Radcliffe, former gentlewoman to Queen Elizabeth, to the Countess of Suffolk.Mary Anne Everett Green, Calendar State Papers James I: 1603-1610 (London, 1857), p. 66 citing TNA SP14/6/9. Other pieces of Elizabeth's jewelley were delivered by Thomas Knyvet. He had kept them at Westminster Palace on the instructions of Queen Elizabeth, and James and his courtiers sent some to Spilman and Herrick for valuation, with an ivory coffer, and a \\"great rich glass set with diamonds rubies emeralds and pearls, made in the form of a woman upon a pillar or case holding a clock with diverse motions\\" worth ¬£2,739 brought from the Tower of London.Thomas Rymer, Foedera, vol. 16 (London, 1715), pp. 564-5. He became a freeman of the City of London in May 1605 and was knighted in the same year. It was said that the King knighted him for the difficult task of making a hole in a great diamond that he wore.Edmund Sawyer, Memorials Of Affairs of State In The Reigns of Elizabeth and James, vol. 2 (London, 1725), p. 57: John Nichols, The Progresses, Processions, and Magnificent Festivities of King James the First, vol. 1 (London, 1828), p. 504. In July 1606 Herrick and John Spilman supplied pearls for the King's embroiderer William Broderick at the time of the visit of Christian IV of Denmark, the brother of Anne of Denmark. The pearls were intended for the king's saddle and the furniture of his horse, and the panes of the kings hose or stockings.John Nichols, The Progresses, Processions, and Magnificent Festivities of King James the First, vol. 2 (London, 1828), p. 61. He served as MP for Leicester for part of the 1604‚Äì1611 parliament. He was prime warden of the Goldsmiths‚Äô Company from 1605 to 1606. In 1607 he took as apprentice his nephew Robert the future poet. In 1621 he was elected MP for Leicester again. In 1612 Herrick lent ¬£2 to the painter Nicholas Hilliard, a fellow member of the Goldsmith's Company, and Hilliard had to pawn a miniature portrait of King James to repay this debt.Elizabeth Goldring, Nicholas Hilliard (Yale, 2019), p. 274. In 1624 Lionel Cranfield, the Lord Treasurer, appointed Philip Jacobson as a goldsmith to the king, noting that George Heriot was dead and Spilman and Herrick rarely did any work.HMC 7th Report: De La Warr (London, 1874), p. 215. Herrick, with the other royal jewellers Abraham Harderet, George Heriot and John Spilman, joined the funeral procession of Anna of Denmark in 1619.Jemma Field, Anna of Denmark: Material and Visual Culture of the Stuart Courts (Manchester, 2020), p. 206. Herrick died at the age of about 90 and was buried at St Martin's Church, Leicester. Family Herrick married Joan May, daughter of Richard May of London and of Mayfield Place, Sussex on 6 May 1596, and had at least one son, Henry Herrick, born 1604. His brother Robert was also an MP. Herrick was the uncle, and later guardian, of the poet Robert Herrick and supported him financially during his time at Cambridge.

Marshall, 564 U.S. 462 (2011), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a bankruptcy court, as a non-Article III court (i.e. courts without full judicial independence) lacked constitutional authority under Article III of the United States Constitution to enter a final judgment on a state law counterclaim that is not resolved in the process of ruling on a creditor's proof of claim, even though Congress purported to grant such statutory authority under . The case drew an unusual amount of interest because the petitioner was the estate of former Playboy Playmate and celebrity Anna Nicole Smith (whose legal name was Vickie Lynn Marshall). Smith died in 2007, long before the Court ultimately decided the case, which her estate lost.  Background  Playboy Playmate and celebrity Anna Nicole Smith married wealthy 89-year-old oil magnate J. Howard Marshall II, and he died 14 months later. When it appeared she had been excluded from his estate, she sued in Texas state probate court, sparking a long and acrimonious series of litigations between herself and Marshall's son E. Pierce Marshall. At one point, a federal district court determined that Smith was owed $88 million from the estate, while the state probate court determined that she was not owed any such substantial sum. The U.S. Supreme Court determined that the federal district court had jurisdiction to rule on the award in Marshall v. Marshall (2006). The case was sent back to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to decide other remaining issues. On March 19, 2010, the same three-judge panel found in favor of E. Pierce Marshall holding that the bankruptcy court did not have the authority to decide the case, and, because the California federal district court should not have reviewed matters previously decided in the Texas probate court, the $88 million judgment for Smith was void. Following the 9th Circuit's decision, lawyers for the estate of Anna Nicole Smith requested the appeal be heard before the entire circuit. However, on May 5, 2010, that request was denied. On September 28, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court again agreed to hear the case. Article III, ¬ß 1 of the Constitution vests \\"[t]he judicial power of the United States\\" in life-tenured and salary- protected judges, who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Non-Article III bankruptcy judges may not exercise the general judicial power of the United States and therefore may not finally resolve controversies that are not within the core Article I bankruptcy power Congress relied upon in creating the current system of bankruptcy jurisdiction. In Northern Pipeline Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50 (1982), a fractured plurality of the Court held that Article I bankruptcy courts could not constitutionally hear a state law breach of contract claim when the debtor was the plaintiff. The main question presented in Stern v. Marshall was whether a bankruptcy court could constitutionally enter a final judgment on an otherwise non-core tort cause of action asserted as a compulsory counterclaim to a creditor's nondischargeability complaint and proof of claim against the debtor. When the matter came before the 9th Circuit appellate court, it rendered the District Court's decision invalid on preclusion grounds since the Bankruptcy Court's decision was non-core. The Obama administration and the Executive Office of the United States Trustee, which wanted to expand bankruptcy jurisdiction in state law matters, instructed the United States Solicitor General to submit a brief on the side of the petitioner.  Questions presented  #Whether the Ninth Circuit opinion, which renders ¬ß157(b)(2)(C) surplusage in light of ¬ß157(b)(2)(B), contravenes Congress‚Äô intent in enacting ¬ß157(b)(2)(C). #Whether Congress may, under Articles I and III, constitutionally authorize core jurisdiction over debtors‚Äô compulsory counterclaims to proofs of claim. #Whether the Ninth Circuit misapplied Marathon and Katchen and contravened this Court's post-Marathon precedent, creating a circuit split in the process, by holding that Congress cannot constitutionally authorize non-Article III bankruptcy judges to enter final judgment on all compulsory counterclaims to proofs of claim.  Opinion of the Court  On June 23, 2011, the United States Supreme Court issued its opinion in the case (now styled Stern v. Marshall, no. 10-179). The majority of the Court held Congress cannot constitutionally authorize non-Article III bankruptcy judges to enter a final judgment on a state law counterclaim that is not resolved in the process of ruling on a creditor‚Äôs proof of claim. The four dissenting judges were of the opinion that such broad powers are necessary to implement legislative intent and authority under Article I and concerns about the reduced efficiency of the bankruptcy courts. This decision effectively ended the case and let stand the decision that Smith's estate was not entitled to the money that had previously been awarded to her. The length of the proceedings led the Chief Justice to compare it to the infamous fictional lawsuit Jarndyce v.

Dr. Kildare performs an emergency operation on a crash victim. Plot Ice skater Frances Marlowe, who has just signed a lucrative contract with an ice show, is driving with her manager, Dan Morton, when her car is struck by a truck. Dr. James Kildare and his fianc√©e, nurse Mary Lamont, see the accident and help the victims, who are only slightly hurt, except for Frances, who has a compound fracture of the leg and a ruptured spleen. Because Kildare is certain that Frances will die from internal bleeding if he does not operate immediately, he performs surgery before the ambulance arrives. Back at New York's Blair General Hospital, Kildare gives her a transfusion under the watchful eye of his diagnostician mentor, crusty Dr. Leonard Gillespie. Morton arrives with an insurance investigator and overhears orderly Vernon Briggs joke about a half-empty whiskey bottle being found in the car Kildare borrowed from Molly Byrd, superintendent of nurses. Weeks later, when the cast is removed from Frances' leg, she is unable to move it. In hysterics she blames the paralysis on Kildare. Gillespie and Kildare have no idea what is causing the paralysis and are shocked when Frances sues Kildare and the hospital for malpractice. Kildare must face trial and Gillespie fears that a jury of laymen will side with the patient. Hospital administrator Dr. Carew wants to settle the case out of court, but Kildare insists on going through with it to protect his standing as a doctor. During the trial, Frances' aggressive attorney establishes that the liquor bottle was found in the car to imply that Kildare had been drinking. Further testimony makes the case seem hopeless until Vernon, who first saw the bottle, suggests during a recess where it might have come from. Kildare goes to see the driver of the truck, who admits that he hid the bottle in Kildare's car because he did not want to be accused of driving drunk, but says that Frances could have prevented the collision but seemed \\"paralyzed.\\" Kildare theorizes that Frances might be afflicted with spina bifida occulta, a congenital condition which may have flared up after several falls on the ice just prior to the accident. Frances agrees to an examination that confirms the diagnosis but her attorney urges her to postpone any operation to prove or disprove it as the cause of her paralysis until after she wins the case. Gillespie's testimony that doctors can avoid malpractice suits by doing nothing and allowing victims to die, and his impassioned plea that they have freedom to attend a patient in an emergency results in the jury's request to render a verdict only if an operation is performed and the results known. Frances agrees and when her recovery is complete, joyfully looks forward to resuming her career.

As a supervisory authority, the FSMA strives to ensure the honest and equitable treatment of financial consumers. It aims at the fair and orderly operation and the transparency of the financial markets by ensuring that listed companies provide correct and complete information. It promotes proper provision of financial services by verifying that financial institutions comply with rules of conduct, by supervising financial products, financial service providers and supplementary pensions, and by contributing to improving the education of financial consumers. In this way the FSMA seeks to ensure that the financial system deserves the trust of its users. History and status The FSMA is, since 1 April 2011, the successor of the Banking, Finance and Insurance Commission (CBFA). Its full name is the Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA). The FSMA's status is that of an autonomous public institution. This means that it was established by law and that it carries out tasks in the general interest entrusted to it by Parliament. The members of the FSMA's governing bodies are appointed by Royal Decree for a period of six years. The FSMA staff have the status of (private sector) employees. The FSMA, alongside the National Bank of Belgium (NBB), supervises the Belgian financial sector. According to the new supervisory model that entered into force in 2011, the FSMA's competences fall within the following six domains: supervision of the financial markets and listed companies, supervision of rules of conduct, product supervision, supervision of financial service providers and of supplementary pensions, and contribution to improving financial education. Tasks The FSMA has six principal tasks. Supervision of financial markets and listed companies The FSMA is responsible for the supervision of the financial markets and listed companies. This means among other things that the FSMA monitors the provision of information by companies listed on the stock market. The FSMA verifies that the company information is complete, gives a faithful image and is made available in a timely manner. In addition, the FSMA ensures that all shareholders of a listed company are treated fairly. Moreover, it ensures the smooth functioning of the financial markets by supervising market infrastructures such as Euronext Brussels. Specifically: * In the case of a takeover bid, the FSMA sees to it that the rules are complied with. * The FSMA ensures that financial information on listed companies is available to everyone at the same time. * The FSMA can intervene in various ways if a company fails to comply with the rules (e.g. by publishing a warning, suspending the listing of a share, imposing a fine, etc.). * The FSMA can investigate possible cases of insider dealing or market manipulation, and may impose sanctions. Product supervision Supervision of financial products is intended to ensure that the products offered to consumers are comprehensible and useful. It should also give consumers a better overview of the costs relating to the products. The FSMA takes initiatives to make financial products simpler and more comprehensible. All financial products offered to consumers come under the supervision of the FSMA. Product supervision is exercised in two ways: by supervising the quality of the information and advertising material for the financial products offered, and by supervising compliance with the regulations governing the products themselves. Specifically: * Where securities are issued to the public in Belgium, the FSMA must give its prior approval to the prospectus or must determine whether the prospectus has been approved abroad; * The FSMA supervises the operation and organisations of undertakings for collective investment (investment funds); * The FSMA oversees the provision of pre- contractual information and the contractual terms and conditions for insurance products and mortgage loans; * The FSMA may be given the right to approve advertisements for savings accounts, among other things; * The FSMA verifies whether financial service providers respect the rules it has drawn up governing the marketing of structured products Rules of conduct The FSMA sees to it that financial institutions comply with the rules of conduct. These rules must ensure that the institutions treat their clients fairly, equitably and professionally. The rules apply to all financial institutions that offer products in Belgium, including banks, insurance companies and stockbroking firms that are required to obtain an authorization from the National Bank of Belgium. Financial institutions must have an appropriate organization and the requisite procedures in place to be able to guarantee that consumers of financial services and products are treated with due care and attention. This means, among other things, the provision of correct information, an appropriate management of potential conflicts of interest and best execution of clients' instructions. In addition, financial institutions may only sell those products that fit the clients' risk profile. Specifically: * The rules of conduct must, for instance, ensure that clients do not fall victim to practices whereby a financial institution sells them a product that does not fit their risk profile or investment goals. * The rules must guarantee that the interests of the financial institution do not prevail over those of its clients. Financial service providers and intermediaries The FSMA is responsible for supervising a wide range of financial service providers who are in direct contact with clients: * intermediaries in banking and investment services and insurance intermediaries (agents and brokers); * management companies of undertakings for collective investment, * portfolio management and investment advice companies; * currency exchange offices (bureaux de change); * mortgage companies. In due course, a decision will be taken on whether the FSMA should also be responsible for supervising financial planners, intermediaries that offer mortgage loans and institutions that provide consumer credit. Specifically: * All brokers and agents must be registered as financial intermediaries with the FSMA. * If someone wants to become an agent or broker in order to sell banking or insurance products, the FSMA checks whether that person is fit and proper for this activity. * If the FSMA determines that someone is offering financial services without the requisite authorization, it publishes a warning to this effect and brings it to the attention of the judicial authorities. Financial education The FSMA is tasked with contributing to better financial education of savers and investors. Since the reform of the structure of financial supervision, it has gained additional competences in this area. Improved financial knowledge will enable individual savers, insured persons, shareholders and investors to be in a better position in their relationships with their financial institutions. As a result, they will be less likely to purchase products that are not suited to their profile. Specifically: * The FSMA is developing an action plan for improving the financial knowledge of Belgians. Pensions The FSMA is responsible for supervising supplementary pensions that employees and the self-employed build up through their professional activities (so-called second-pillar pensions). The FSMA supervises compliance with the social legislation relating to second-pillar pensions, and also oversees the financial health of institutions for occupational retirement provision, which manage supplementary pension plans. Specifically: * The FSMA handles complaints from members and beneficiaries relating to their supplementary pension rights. * If an institution for retirement provision experiences a shortfall, the FSMA can require it to develop a recovery or consolidation plan in order to ensure that the shortfall is made up as soon as possible Substantial shareholdings Having explained the FSMA's tasks in detail above. In details shareholders are required to notify their holdings to the FSMA when their stake exceeds or falls below certain thresholds. The initial threshold for the notification of substantial shareholdings in Belgium is 5%. Issuers having shares admitted to trading on a regulated market, for which Belgium is the home member state can stipulate additional notification thresholds, on the basis of article 18 of the law of 2 May 2007. Place in the world The FSMA is a member of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). The FSMA also takes part in the work of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), chaired by the president of the European Central Bank. In addition, the FSMA is represented on the international bodies that coordinate supervision, such as the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the International Organization of Pension Supervisors (IOPS). Finally, the FSMA has signed numerous bilateral and multilateral collaboration agreements with fellow supervisory authorities. The FSMA also sits on a number of supervisory colleges that coordinate the supervision of market infrastructures.

Typhoon Irma originated from a monsoon trough situated near Guam in the Western Pacific Ocean. It slowly developed, with insufficient organization delaying classification as a tropical cyclone. By June 24, organization improved as the system encountered favorable conditions aloft and the disturbance attained tropical storm intensity the next day. Moving west, Irma gradually deepened, and on June 28, it was believed to have attained typhoon intensity. On the morning of June 27, Irma was upgraded into a typhoon. After passing northeast of the Philippines, Typhoon Irma attained its peak intensity on June 29\\\\. Accelerating to the north and then the northeast, Irma steadily weakened as it encountered significantly less favorable conditions. The typhoon made landfall in central Japan on June 30\\\\. Irma weakened below typhoon intensity the next day, and later on July 1, Irma transition into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of the cyclone were tracked until July 7, when it merged with an extratropical low south of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Although Irma stayed offshore the Philippines, moisture associated with the storm inundated areas already affected by Typhoon Hal earlier in the week. The capital city of Manila was 60% flooded, resulting in the evacuation of 40,000. Six drownings were reported in the nearby suburb of Quezon City, where 1,000 families were evacuated. Citywide, eight people were killed. In Olongapo City, seven people were buried because of a landslide. Overall, more than 500,000 people were directly affected by the typhoon throughout the country. A total of 253 homes were destroyed, with 1,854 others partially damaged. Nationwide, 65 people were killed due to the typhoon and damage totaled $16 million (1985 USD). Across Japan, Irma brought widespread flooded that resulted in 1,475 mudslides, which damaged 625 residencies. The storm left 650,000 customers without power. In the Chiba Prefecture, seven people were injured. In the capital city of Tokyo, 119 trees were toppled, 40 homes were flooded, 20 flights were cancelled, 26 railway lines were suspended, and 25 roads were flooded, all combining to leave more than 240,000 stranded. In Izu ≈åshima, 17 boats were swept away and 20 houses were damaged. Nationwide, 19 people were killed and 49 others were injured. A total of 811 dwellings were destroyed and 10,000 others were damage. Throughout the country, the storm inflicted $545 million in damage. Meteorological history During mid-June 1985, the monsoon trough in the Western Pacific retreated eastward to near Guam, spawning several areas of low pressure. At 00:00 UTC on June 17, a tropical disturbance embedded within the monsoon trough was detected by meteorologists on weather satellite imagery about southwest of the island of Ponape. Although the disturbance's surface circulation was initially ill-defined, interaction with an upper-level low (ULL) to the southeast of Guam associated with a broader tropical upper- tropospheric trough (TUTT) enhanced development and thus the low was slow to develop. Moving west-northwest south of a ridge, the disturbance passed south- southeast of the Truk Atoll early on June 18\\\\. Following an increase of thunderstorm activity associated with the disturbance in both coverage and organization, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system at noon the same day. During the next three days, the disturbance maintained vigorous, but poorly organized convection. Data from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft on June 19 failed to locate a surface circulation. That afternoon, the TCFA was re-issued. On the afternoon of June 20, the Hurricane Hunters finally founded a closed circulation, but outflow from nearby Typhoon Hal inhibited further development. Early on June 22, the TCFA was cancelled because of a decrease in thunderstorm activity. By June 24, however, vertical wind shear had begun to relax, coinciding with an expansion of the storm's southwesterly outflow channel. Several hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the cyclone. After an increase in thunderstorm activity, the TCFA was re-issued for the fifth and final time on the evening of June 24\\\\. Based on a rapid improvement in the system's convective structure and Dvorak classifications of tropical storm intensity, the JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical storm Irma early on June 25. Shortly thereafter, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft measured winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of , though these winds were displaced roughly to the west of the center. Based on this, the JMA followed suit and declared the system a tropical cyclone at 06:00 UTC on June 25. At around the same time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) started to follow the storm and assigned it with the local name Daling. At midday on June 25, the JMA upgraded Irma to severe tropical storm intensity Initially, the JTWC predicted Irma to follow Hal along the monsoon trough into the South China Sea before curving around a subtropical ridge. Irma slowly deepened, and according to the JMA, the system attained a secondary peak intensity of late on June 25. However, by June 26, the JTWC revised its forecast and instead expected the storm to take a more northerly trek. On June 27, Irma's forward speed slowed as it approached the edge of the subtropical ridge situated along the 130th meridian east while intensifying. That morning, both the JTWC and the JMA estimated that Irma attained typhoon intensity; this upgraded was primarily based on data from ship reports. Continuing to intensify, Irma moved northward. However, by June 28, the JMA indicated that Irma leveled off in intensity. At 00:00 UTC on June 29, the JTWC estimated a peak intensity of . Six hours later, the JMA increased the intensity of the typhoon to , its maximum intensity. At this time, the agency also assessed the pressure of the storm at . Shortly after its peak, Typhoon Irma began to accelerate towards the northeast in the direction of central Japan in response to westerlies. Irma quickly weakened, and on the evening of June 29, the JMA decreased the intensity of Irma to . Tracking just east of the Ryukyu Islands, Irma began to acquire extratropical characteristics A Hurricane Hunter flight on June 30 suggested that that typhoon was encountering cooler and drier air, although the storm maintained a eye. That evening, the typhoon made landfall on Honshu. At 00:00 UTC on July 1, the JMA downgraded Irma into a severe tropical storm. Six hours later, the cyclone completed its extratropical transition near Tokyo; the JTWC issued its final warning on the system. The JMA continued the monitor the system as it passed northeast of the Kuril Islands. On July 7, the JMA ceased tracking the system as it had merged with an extratropical low south of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Preparations and impact Prior to the arrival of Irma, storm signals were issued for much of Luzon, including Samar and Catanduanes. Although the system remained offshore Taiwan, it came close enough to require storm signals. Even though Typhoon Irma passed well east to the Philippines, over of rain fell over parts of Luzon. These rains resulted in major flooding; Irma was also the second storm to directly affect the nation within a week, following Typhoon Hal. The capital city of Manila sustained flooding along low-lying areas, which stranded motorists. A total of 60% of the city was flooded, forcing the evacuation of 40,000 persons. Six drownings occurred in the suburb of Quezon City, where 1,000 families were evacuated, 700 to churches and 300 to schools. Within the Manila metropolitan area, a man and a woman were also electrocuted. All classes in Manila were suspended, and many stores and offices shut down for a day. Furthermore, domestic flights in and out of Manila were canceled since the runway was flooded with water deep. Citywide, eight people were killed. According to press reports, Irma was to worst tropical cyclone to directly impact Manila in over 10 years. Offshore Bataan, eight fishermen were initially rendered missing after a boat capsized. In Olongapo City, seven people were buried due to a landslide. In the downtown Santa Cruz area, all forms of transportation except for the railroad were immobile. The Makati area sustained waist-deep flooding. Due to both Irma and Hal, 14 communities in Tarlac were flooded, leaving 375,000 people displaced, 116,963 of whom were evacuated to 46 evacuation centers. Seven bridges were also damaged. Overall, 511,067 people, or 94,661 families were directly affected by the typhoon. A total of 253 homes were destroyed, with 1,854 others partially damaged. Nationwide, 65 people were killed due to the typhoon. The storm inflicted $13.7 million in damage to infrastructure and $2.3 million in damage to agriculture, totaling to approximately $16 million. Upon making landfall on Honshu, Irma became the first tropical system to strike the nation that season. Impacting an area already devastated by prior flooding, Irma deluged the archipelago with additional precipitation. Mount Ontake received of rain throughout the duration of the storm. Additionally, Mount Amagi recorded in a day, including in an hour, both storm highs in those respective categories. A total of 1,475 mudslides occurred in Japan, resulting in 625 damaged homes. Approximately 650,000 customers were left without power at the height of the storm while 160 trains were delayed or cancelled, which left 50,000 people stranded. In Chiba Prefecture, one person was listed missing due to a drowning, where seven persons were also hurt and over 200 houses were flooded. There, 400,000 individuals were also stranded due to lack of train service. In Tokyo, 119 trees were toppled and 25 roads were flooded. Twenty domestic airline flights were cancelled and 26 railway lines within Tokyo were suspended, leaving 240,000 people stranded. Throughout the city, at least 40 dwellings sustained flooding. In Izu ≈åshima, 17 boats were swept away and 20 houses were damaged. Offshore, 26 individuals were rescued from a freighter Gloria Fortuna. Throughout the country, 493 people sought refuge in shelters. In all, 19 people were killed and 49 others were injured. A total of 811 dwellings were destroyed and 10,000 homes were damaged, with 12,691 houses flooded. Nationwide, a total of of crops were damaged. Across Japan, damage amounted to $545 million, including at least $61 million in property damage.

This procedure is adopted because the point at which an error is detected may not be the point of the actual input error. For instance, the string 'Look up below' might be detected as invalid when 'below' is encountered, but the true error might be that 'up' has been written where 'down' was intended. So, if 'k' is set to '4' and an error is encountered 100 tokens into the program, the compiler will attempt to substitute all possible strings of tokens between points 96 and 100 tokens into the program. If it finds some combination that parses without error and allows it to continue it will do so, reporting other errors as it goes. Usually the compiler will not produce a compiled program even if it manages to parse the entire input text after 'fixing' an error, as the newly 'fixed' program may not be what the programmer intended.

The position was included in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare at the time. Trotter was the first woman to hold the U.S. government's highest education post, although the position did not become cabinet-level until 1979. Trotter worked as a university administrator before and after serving as Assistant Secretary. As president of academic affairs at the University of Georgia, she intervened in 1981 to allow nine football players to pass a remedial English course, allowing them to play against Pittsburgh in the 1982 Sugar Bowl, which resulted in a scandal at the school. Early life and education She was born Virginia Yapp on November 29, 1921, in Boise, Idaho, and was raised in Manhattan, Kansas, where her father Rockford Glenn Yapp worked as the State Entomologist for Kansas and a professor of entomology at Kansas State University. She graduated from Kansas State University in 1943, and then earned a master's degree from Kansas State in 1947. She earned a doctorate from Ohio State University in 1960. She married Robert Trotter and had one child, Robert Trotter, Jr. Her husband was a Navy pilot who died in a plane crash off the island of Saipan after World War II. She never remarried. Professional career Trotter began her administrative career at the University of Utah in 1948 as director of the university's home management laboratory. From 1950 to 1955 she served as head of the Home Economics and Management Division at the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln. From 1955 to 1963 she worked as chairman of home economics at the University of Vermont. Trotter returned to the University of Nebraska in 1963 and served as dean of the College of Home Economics at the school until 1972, and vice chancellor for academic affairs from 1972 to 1974. After serving as Assistant Secretary of Education from 1974 to 1977, she returned to academia as the first president for academic affairs at the University of Georgia.  Georgia scandal  While serving as president of academic affairs at Georgia, Trotter was implicated in intervening in 1981 to alter grades for nine football players so that they would pass a remedial English course. After the players were allowed to play in the team's bowl game, University of Georgia teacher Jan Kemp brought the issue into the public with a protest letter on February 1, 1982. Kemp was relieved of duties, and then filed suit against the university, Trotter and another administrator. In 1986, Kemp won a $2.58 million judgment against the three defendants, including $1.5 million from Trotter for punitive damages. The total judgment was later reduced to $1.08 million. As a result of the scandal, Trotter was removed from her position as president of academic affairs and reassigned. The University of Georgia also stopped admitting athletes who were \\"partial qualifiers\\" under the NCAA's admission requirements.

Pathology HCCC consist of cells with abundant clear cytoplasm, arranged in cords, trabeculae or clusters in a hyalinized stroma. Nuclear pleomorphism is usually minimal and mitoses are infrequently seen. Owing to their glycogen content, which explains the \\"clear\\" appearance under the microscope, tumour cells stain with PAS. Immunostains for S100 and smooth muscle actin (SMA) are typically negative, but positive for cytokeratins and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA).

Obituary. Idaho Statesman. December 8, 2009. Trusky was an energetic teacher who taught everything from basic freshman composition, to writing poetry, to book arts. His imaginative courses, high standards, and wildly creative assignments challenged, and sometimes frustrated, students. Trusky could come across as a crusty teacher with zero tolerance for cookie-cutter sentimentality; as one student remembers, \\"I was taking a poetry class and the first thing he said was, 'If anyone wants to write about unicorns, they should consider another class. Unicorns aren't real and shouldn't be read about in poetry.\\"Oland, Dana. \\"Boise State's Tom Trusky Dies - Creative, Dynamic, Funny and Mischievous, the Longtime Professor Will Be Missed, His Colleagues Say. Idaho Statesman. Thursday, December 3, 2009. On the other hand, Trusky could be wildly supportive of student work that dared to push artistic boundaries. Former student Andrea Scott recalls that Trusky: : promoted my graduate thesis, \\"I'm Not Perfect Anyway.\\" The book combined my interviews and photography of women who had facial scars and how it affected them. Tom saw my vision and said \\"Go for it,\\" even though others thought the project was \\"weird\\" and didn't fit the norm for a graduate thesis. Later, he secretly took my project to New York, where it appeared at an art gallery. I found out when he sent me a letter‚Äîtypical Tom style.Oland, Dana. \\"Boise State's Tom Trusky Dies - Creative, Dynamic, Funny and Mischievous, the Longtime Professor Will Be Missed, His Colleagues Say. Idaho Statesman. Thursday, December 3, 2009. The Council for Advancement and Support of Education named Trusky Idaho's Professor of the Year in 1990, 1991, and 1993.‚ÄòIconic‚Äô Boise State University Professor Dies: English Professor Tom Trusky Instrumental in Initiating University‚Äôs Master of Fine Arts Program. Idaho Press-Tribune (Nampa, ID). Thursday, December 3, 2009. Trusky also played a major role in the founding of Boise State University's Master of Fine Arts Creative Writing program. Cold drill In 1970 Trusky founded cold drill, a graphically striking, loose-leaf magazine in a box. From the beginning cold drill was intended to, in Trusky's words, \\"destroy the elitist, old-girl, old-boy networks\\" that dominate many collegiate literary magazines.Lee, Marie Russell. \\"Maverick Magazine: Unorthodox Publication Leads the Nation by Being the Exception to the Rule.\\" Focus: Boise State University. Winter 1989. Vol. IX, No. 2. P. 36-37. Working in partnership with scores of student editors, Trusky came up with such innovations as scratch-and-sniff poetry, handmade paper crafted from Idaho native plants, and the memorable 1985 \\"All Idaho\\" edition which features graphics inspired by the art found on burlap potato sacks. Over the years cold drill won a number of first-place awards from such entities as the Associated Collegiate Press/National Scholastic Press Association, the Columbia Scholastic Press Association, and the Rocky Mountain Collegiate Press Association.Lee, Marie Russell. \\"Maverick Magazine: Unorthodox Publication Leads the Nation by Being the Exception to the Rule.\\" Focus: Boise State University. Winter 1989. Vol. IX, No. 2. P. 36-37. Ahsahta Press In 1974 Trusky and his Boise State University colleagues Orvis C. Burmaster and Dale Boyer co-founded Ahsahta Press, a non-profit press specializing in western American poetry. Ahsahta reprinted the work of such early western poets as Peggy Pond Church, Genevieve Taggard, H.L. Davis, Hazel Hall, Gwendolen Haste, Haniel Long, and Norman MacLeod. Ahsahta also takes credit for discovering, and initially publishing, the work of such contemporary western poets as David Baker, Utah Poet Laureate Katharine Coles, Wyn Cooper, Gretel Ehrlich, Cynthia Hogue, Leo Romero, Linda Bierds, Richard Blessing, and Carolyne Wright. Among his other achievements as an Ahsahta Press editor, Trusky edited the anthology Women Poets of the West (1978), a volume that remains one of Ahsahta's best sellers. Poetry in Public Places Starting in 1975, Trusky initiated the Poetry in Public Places (PiPP) series. Each year nine poems by Boise State University students and/or non-student western poets would be printed on colorful posters and distributed free of charge to appear in schools, on metro buses, and in other public venues.Hillenger, Charles. \\"University's Tribute to Hemingway: Cultural Complex at Boise State Bears Name of Author.\\" Los Angeles Times. January 25, 1987. P. D 10. In a 2001 interview Trusky said of the Poetry in Public Places series, \\"My goal was to break the neck of rhymed poetry and slap sentimentality useless, and to bring diversity in all its senses: literary, social political, philosophical and nonsensical.\\" \\"Boise State Student Union Gallery Features Poster Poetry.\\" June 2001. http://news.boisestate.edu/newsrelease/archive/2001/june/pipp.html. The PiPP series would continue in various forms for over two decades. Nell Shipman A lifelong lover of movies who came to have a keen interest in feature films shot in Idaho, Trusky began researching the work and life of Canadian-born silent-screen actor, screenwriter, and producer Nell Shipman in 1984 after learning that she had shot films at her Lionhead Lodge studio on Northern Idaho's Priest Lake. Trusky would spend more than twenty years tirelessly working to promote Shipman's work and recover her extant films. The search for lost Shipman films stretched all the way to the then-Soviet Union and resulted in, among other coups, the recovery and restoration of Shipman's 1919 film Back to God's Country.Wierenga, Jeremiah Robert. \\"Story Girl: Nell Shipman, the Little Lass Who 'Went up on Stage' and Never Came Down.\\" Boise Weekly March 10, 2010. http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/story- girl/Content?oid=1515660 Thanks to Trusky's efforts, all of Shipman's extant films are now available on DVD. In addition to recovering her films, Trusky published Shipman's autobiography The Silent Screen and My Talking Heart (1987) as well as Letters from God's Country (2003), a collection of Shipman's correspondence. Kay Armitage, professor of film studies at the University of Toronto and noted Shipman scholar, credits Trusky with bringing Shipman \\"back to life.\\"Wierenga, Jeremiah Robert. \\"Story Girl: Nell Shipman, the Little Lass Who 'Went up on Stage' and Never Came Down.\\" Boise Weekly. March 10, 2010. http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/story-girl/Content?oid=1515660 James Castle Starting in 1993 Trusky became fascinated with the life and work of James Castle, a deaf, self-taught artist who was born in Idaho's remote Garden Valley; spent five years at the Idaho School for the Deaf and Blind; and enjoyed a brief artistic vogue in the late 1950s and early 1960s before being largely forgotten by the time of his death in 1977.Flagg, Marianne. \\"A Passion for Castle 's Art.\\" Idaho Statesman. Thursday, January 27, 2000. P. 1E, 2E. Trusky's scholarship helped raise the awareness of the late artist's work. Trusky authored a self-published biography of the artist, James Castle: His Life & Art (2004), and contributed to the documentary film Dream House: The Art & Life of James Castle (2008). Trusky's obsessions with both James Castle and Nell Shipman reflect his preference for the work of overlooked, under- appreciated writers and artists as opposed to that of literary and artistic superstars whose places in the canon have already been assured. As Trusky said in an interview conducted in the year 2000, \\"I get to speak for Nell, and I get to speak for James. . . . They don't have their voices. Their art is their voice.\\"Flagg, Marianne. \\"A Passion for Castle's Art.\\" Idaho Statesman. Thursday, January 27, 2000. P. 1E, 2E. Hemingway Western Studies Center In 1991 Trusky was named Director of Boise State University's Hemingway Western Studies Center, a position he held for the remainder of his life. As Director, Trusky led a two-year effort that, in 1993, resulted in the Library of Congress designating the Hemingway Western Studies Center as the home of the Idaho Center for the Book (ICB) and appointing Trusky as the ICB's first director.\\"New Idaho Center for the Book Approved.\\" The Library of Congress Information Bulletin. December 13, 1993. https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/93/9323/cfb.html. His position as Director of the Hemingway Western Studies Center allowed Trusky to pursue projects that interested him, including Idaho by the Book (a literary map of Idaho), the Idaho Authors card game, and the mounting of a variety of highly creative exhibits on topics ranging from zines to refrigerator art. It was thanks to the Hemingway Western Studies Center that Trusky was able to publish a number of books, including Some Zines: American Alternative & Underground Magazines, Newsletters and APAs (1992), Missing P ges: Idaho & the Book (1994), and James Castle: His Life & Art (2004). Book arts A lifelong collector of eccentric and artist's books, Trusky was always interested in creating books that were as much works of visual art as literary texts, an interest he first expressed through the creative design of cold drill. Over the years Trusky attended a number of courses on the books arts and spent an entire sabbatical in New York City taking book-arts courses at Columbia University and the Center for Book Arts. Beginning in the 1990s and continuing for the rest of his life Trusky taught graduate and undergraduate book-arts courses at Boise State University. Personal life Trusky was married for many years to Tara Burt. For the last two decades of his life Trusky lived with his partner, Enver Sulejman. Trusky died quietly at home on November 27, 2009 while sitting on his couch addressing Christmas cards and making notes about drawings by James Castle.Tom Trusky. Obituary. Idaho Statesman. December 8, 2009. Trusky willed his lifetime collection of artist's books, including a number of works by James Castle, to Boise State University.Woodward, Tim. \\"Eccentric Professor Tom Trusky Wills Boise State University a Stunning Gift: Frugal English Teacher Secretly Assembled an Art Collection Worth Hundreds of Thousands.\\" Idaho Statesman.\\" December 5, 2010. Most of Trusky's ashes were placed in the Snake River at Celebration Park, while a few were deposited at the foot of James Castle's grave.

Plot Marshall and Lily officially move to the suburbs, where they find Lily's dad Mickey unwilling to move out. After putting up with him for two weeks, Marshall finally tells Mickey to move out. When the power goes out, a hurt Mickey decides to play tricks on Marshall and attempts to prevent him from successfully reaching the basement where the fuse box is located. When Marshall trips down the basement stairs, Lily convinces Mickey to instruct Marshall, via intercom, how to reach the fuse box. He does so, and Marshall is able to restore the power.

Written by Eknath Easwaran, the book was originally published in the United States in 1984. Subsequent editions of the book have been published in the US and India, and foreign (non-English) editions have also been published in several languages.Non-US editions of Nilgiri Press Books (accessed 17 December 2011)}. The book's original subtitle was the inspiration of Saint Francis, Saint Augustine, Saint Paul, Mother Teresa. In its second edition in 1996, as part of a 3-book series entitled Classics of Christian Inspiration,The 3-volume Classics of Christian Inspiration includes Love never faileth, Original goodness, and Seeing with the eyes of love (, , , respectively). the book was subtitled Eknath Easwaran on St. Francis, St. Paul, St. Augustine, & Mother Teresa. Across its editions, the book has been reviewed in a scholarly journal, and in several newspapers. Topics covered Each edition of Love Never Faileth contains a separate part on each of the four Christian spiritual figures mentioned in the book's subtitle. Each part contains a short introduction by Carol Lee Flinders, followed by a longer commentary by Easwaran. The book also contains a short overall introduction by Flinders. Each of Easwaran's commentaries is structured around a text: The Prayer of Saint Francis, Mother Teresa's \\"Love is a fruit in season at all times,\\" Paul's Epistle on Love, and Augustine's description from the Confessions of what it is to \\"Enter into the joy of the Lord.\\" To clarify the commentaries, each edition also concludes with a brief description of the text-focused method of meditation that is several times mentioned by Easwaran. The 1984 edition also includes woodblock prints of each of the faces of each of the four spiritual figures. The 1996 edition includes an 8-page index. Reception Reviews have appeared in the National Catholic Reporter, Studia Mystica, the Western New York Catholic, Prairie Messenger, and The B.C. Catholic, The National Catholic Reporter stated that in Love Never Faileth, \\"Easwaran describes the way [these spiritual figures] think, pray and live and invites us to slow down our franticness, examine our priorities and follow an eight-step program that will make all life take on the quality of a summer retreat - bright with hope and beauty.\\" In Studia Mystica, Wayne Teasdale wrote that \\"Love Never Faileth is a very important new addition to the literature of meditation.\\" He wrote that the book > is a unique attempt to lead people into the concrete realization, that is, > in their daily lives, of love's ultimacy and its great power to heal as well > as transform. It goes beyond the mere hortatory purpose of most > hagiographies, beyond edification, and distills the innermost moral teaching > of the saints (an innermost teaching that is eminently mystical). [The > author] takes this teaching ... and applies it to everyday life, showing > also how every one of us can do the same as the saints. Teasdale also noted that \\"Half the book is devoted to Augustine, and the briefest chapter is devoted to Mother Teresa's vision ... this is not a speculative work .... This is a very practical book by a very practical spiritual teacher.\\" The Western New York Catholic stated that \\"This book shows how, in specific terms, we can all stretch our capacity to love beyond anything we can imagine and how prayer with meditation can tap inner strength at will .... The methods used in Love Never Faileth were familiar in the early Church, as the author illustrates through his use of inspirational passages from the four 'great lovers of God.'\\" Prairie Messenger, a Roman Catholic publication, stated that Easwaran \\"was formed on both Christian and Oriental scriptures ... [and] seems especially at home in Love Never Faileth ... To each [chapter] an introduction ... sets the stage for Easwaran's dramatic reading of each of his favorites.\\" The B. C. Catholic wrote that the chapters on Saint Francis and Mother Teresa most compellingly show Easwaran's \\"special fondness for people who suffer from material and spiritual poverty and especially from a lack of love .... His meditation on St. Francis' Prayer ... is the most inspiring I have read, especially as Easwaran illustrates it with anecdotes from his own life.\\" Editions The original edition was published in 1984 by Nilgiri Press, who republished it in 1996 as one volume in a series entitled Classics of Christian Inspiration.

It is native to Europe, Asia, and much of North America. In parts of the north-central and northeastern United States it is an introduced species. Common names include fringed sagebrush, prairie sagewort, arctic sage and pasture sage. The plant is not, however, closely related to the true sages Salvia. Artemisia frigida is a perennial plant but with a woody base. The stems spread out, generally forming a mat or clump up to tall. The stems are covered in lobed gray-green leaves which are coated in silvery hairs. The inflorescence contains many spherical flower heads each about half a centimeter wide and lined with woolly-haired, gray-green or brownish phyllaries. The flower heads contain several pistillate ray florets and many bisexual disc florets. The plant is aromatic, with a strong scent. This plant can make a great many seeds. It can also spread by layering; in some years it produces very few seeds. Artemisia frigida is common and dominant or codominant in many areas, especially in dry and disturbed habitat types. It is common in the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains in North America, where it occurs in grasslands, shrublands, and woodlands, among others. It has a tendency to increase in areas that have been heavily grazed by livestock. Overgrowth of the plant is sometimes an indicator of overgrazing on rangeland. It sometimes becomes an aggressive weed. Ranchers have considered the plant to be both an adequate forage species and a worthless nuisance species. Artemisia frigida's common name is wild sage. Sometimes known as prairie sage and sagewort. A number of wild animals consume the plant, including white-tailed jackrabbits and sage grouse. Artemisia frigida is cultivated for its foliage effects, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Artemisia frigida has a variety of uses for Indigenous peoples of North America.Artemisia frigida. USDA NRCS Plant Guide. Retrieved December 30, 2011. It is used medicinally for coughs, colds, wounds, and heartburn by the Blackfoot. The Cree people use it for headache and fever and the Tewa people took it for gastritis and indigestion. It also has ceremonial and veterinary applications, including for the Blackfoot, who reportedly used the crushed leaves to \\"revive gophers after children clubbed them while playing a game\\".Artemisia frigida.

Melchior Zobel von Giebelstadt was born in 1502, the son of Georg Zobel and his wife Dorothea R√ºdt von Callenberg.Article on German Wikipedia, Profile on catholic-hierarchy.org As a younger son, he was groomed for a career in the church from an early age. He became a canon (Domizellar) of W√ºrzburg Cathedral on 27 January 1521.Article on German Wikipedia He studied at the University of Wittenberg in summer semester 1521. He spent winter semester 1521 studying at the University of Leipzig. He became a Domherr of W√ºrzburg Cathedral in 1522. On 4 March 1540 he was elected dean of W√ºrzburg Cathedral and was subsequently ordained as a priest. Following the death of Bishop Konrad von Th√ºngen, Zobel von Giebelstadt was a candidate to replace him as Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg, but he lost the election, held on 1 July 1540, to Conrad von Bibra. On 19 August 1544 the cathedral chapter of W√ºrzburg Cathedral elected him as the new Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg. A delegation from the cathedral chapter informed Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor of his election on 22 August 1544 and Pope Paul III confirmed his appointment on 27 October 1544. During the Schmalkaldic War of 1546-47, he allied the Prince-Bishopric of W√ºrzburg with the pro-Catholic imperial forces. That war ended when the Diet of Augsburg of 1547-48 declared the Augsburg Interim. Zobel von Giebelstadt's opposition to the Augsburg Interim led to him and six other prelates being personally rebuked by Charles V at an audience held on 9 April 1548. As bishop, Zobel von Giebelstadt was fiercely opposed to the efforts of Friedrich Bernbeck (1511‚Äì70), mayor of Kitzingen to introduce the Reformation in Kitzingen. He attempted to found a Jesuit university in 1556, but this effort failed as the order was unable to provide a sufficient number of priests to staff the proposed university. Grumbach-Zobel Affair Spot where Melchior Zobel von Giebelstadt died after assassination by Grumbach's henchman Christoph Kretzen Throughout his prelacy, Zobel von Giebelstadt was engaged in a feud with Wilhelm von Grumbach. About 1540 Grumbach became associated with Margrave Casimir's son, the turbulent Albert Alcibiades of Bayreuth, whom he served both in peace and war. As a landholder, Grumbach was a vassal of the W√ºrzburg Bishops and had held office at the court of Conrad von Bibra, who was elected Prince-Bishop in 1540. Just before his death in 1544, Conrad gave Grumbach 10,000 gold florins as a gift, without obtaining the consent of the cathedral chapter. When the new Prince-Bishop, Melchior Zobel von Giebelstadt, asked for the money back from Grumbach, he paid, but the harmonious relationship between lord and vassal were destroyed. Unable to free himself and his associates from the suzerainty of the bishop by appealing to the imperial courts he decided to adopt more violent measures, and his friendship with Margrave Albert was very serviceable in this connection. After the conclusion of the Peace of Passau in 1552, Grumbach assisted Albert in his career of plunder in Franconia during the Second Margrave War and was thus able to take some revenge upon his enemy, Melchior Zobel. Albert's career, however, was checked by his defeat at the Battle of Sievershausen in July 1553 and his subsequent flight to France, while the W√ºrzburg bishop took advantage of this state of affairs to seize Grumbach's lands. The knight obtained an order of restitution from the Imperial Chamber Court (Reichskammergericht), but he was unable to carry this into effect. Grumbach's men attempted to assassinate Zobel von Giebelstadt three times. On 15 April 1558 Zobel (like Florian Geyer earlier) was seized and killed by Grumbach‚Äôs henchman Christoph Kretzen. Grumbach declared he was innocent of this crime, but his story was not believed, and he fled to France.

In 1985 he co-founded with Andrew Starr, Hot Mix Productions in Phoenix, Arizona. Hot Mix Productions operated the syndicated \\"Hot Mix Radio Network\\" which played on up to 175 radio stations around the world.The Complete History of Hot Mix. Discjockeys.com. Starrworld Enterprises LLC. Retrieved January 15, 2012.  Early career  Rajput grew up on the north side of Chicago, Illinois and began working as a disc jockey (DJ) while in high school. In 1980, Dave Rajput moved to Phoenix, AZ and worked in nightclubs as a DJ. He made a transition from playing disco music to a new style called Chicago House. Rob Wegner, a DJ in Arizona, was quoted as saying that Rajput was influential in bringing Chicago House to Arizona in the 1980s.Steven Ratz, Jr. (February 2002). Rob Wegner Interview. Sonik Magazine. p. 46. In 1983 he won first-place trophy in the \\"Phoenix Arizona Battle Of The DJ's\\", which was held at Gatsby's Nightclub.  Hot Mix Productions In March 1985 Rajput was hired by KOPA radio station to air the Chicago house music format a Saturday night program titled \\"Saturday Night Hot Mix\\". Due to the shows success, the 3 hour program was extended to 7 hours. By May 1985, Hot Mix Productions was formed and the \\"Hot Mix\\" program aired on KOPA until January 1986. Although the station closed due to poor ratings, the only positive ratings KOPA received were due to their \\"Hot Mix\\" Saturday night program, which had doubled the radio station's overall ratings. The show was produced and recorded by Dave Rajput and Art Morales, KOPA music director. While Rajput worked nights as a club DJ to produce and mix the weekly radio show, he also attended Mesa Community College where he took Radio & Television classes. While there, he became friends with Andrew Starr, who ran Windy City DJs that provided music and entertainment for College and High School events. Needing recording equipment to produce the show in a new venue, Rajput partnered at the end of January 1986 with Andrew Starr who had the needed equipment, record albums and assistance in producing Rajput's radio show. In exchange for use of the equipment, Rajput mentioned Andrew Starr and Windy City DJs on each \\"Hot Mix\\" show. In July 1986, \\"Hot Mix\\" received a permanent spot on KZZP on Fridays and used the recording studios at KZZP to mix and record their show. In September 1986, WBJW became the first station to sign up for their programming outside of Arizona and Hot Mix became a syndicated radio program. By the end of 1986, Hot Mix had five stations in syndication. In 1989, Hot Mix was nominated for its first Billboard Magazine Radio syndication award in the category ‚ÄúRadio Syndication - Top 40/Crossover‚Äù; Other nominees were Shadoe Stevens, Rick Dees, and the winner, Casey Kasem. As of January 1, 1990, ABC Radio Networks contracted with Hot Mix Productions to market, distribute, and sell Hot Mix in the United States. The first mix was called ‚ÄúMix of the Decade 1989-90‚Äù and was distributed on vinyl disc to all radio stations signed up to play the program. By 1989 there were 35 stations in the U.S. In July 1990, ABC began producing programs on cd which made Hot Mix the first and only show of its kind worldwide to distributed weekly on Compact Disc. In 1991, Hot Mix was being syndicated by ABC Radio Network and was being heard on over 175 stations weekly worldwide. That year it was also nominated and lost a second Billboard Radio Award in the Syndicated show Top 40/Crossover music category.  Other music industry projects  Beginning in March 1988 Rajput began working with retail stores, teaching them how to program their in-store and entertainment formats. He designed a foundation and implemented training whereas all employees understand how to present music to their customers. After 500 continuous weeks (10 years) producing the Hot Mix show, Rajput was burned out and sold his 50% ownership to his partner Andrew Starr, and went back to Chicago temporarily to invest in a business called Dine Healthy Chicago. Since 1997, Rajput has been working as a DJ in the Scottsdale area under his production company, Hot Mix Productions. Under labels such as Powerhouse Records, Dave Rajput remixed and produced remixes during 1998-1999 that were distributed by Powerhouse Records or Promo Only. From 1999 to 2001, he was an investor and entertainment director for the new dance club, Radius, that had been added to an existing club, Axis. In 2002 he became Entertainment Director for Barcelona Restaurant in Scottsdale where he designed and implemented an emerging music video format displayed on 15 plasma screens. He implemented new marketing programs (e.g., V.I.P. Program, Customer Appreciation Campaign, print and advertising campaign) and scheduled and formatted the live music program with the house band, Zowie Bowie. These activities resulted in Barcelona transitioning from a restaurant to nightclub and being voted Scottsdale's Best Nightclub in July 2007 by Scottsdale Magazine readers. In September, 2001 he began to include combinations of services, such as event direction, MC, and DJ services.

Its recommended English common name is snowy waxcap in the UK. The species has a largely north temperate distribution, occurring in grassland in Europe and in woodland in North America and northern Asia, but is also known from Australia. It typically produces basidiocarps (fruit bodies) in the autumn. Taxonomy The species was first described in 1781 by the Austrian mycologist Franz Xaver von Wulfen as Agaricus virgineus. It was subsequently combined in a number of different genera, being transferred to Hygrocybe in 1969 before being transferred to Cuphophyllus. The specific epithet comes from Latin \\"virgineus\\" (= pure white). Hygrocybe nivea, first described by the Italian mycologist and naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1772, was sometimes distinguished by producing smaller and more slender fruit bodies than H. virginea, but is now regarded as a synonym. Molecular research published in 2011, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences found that Hygrocybe virginea does not belong in Hygrocybe sensu stricto and belongs in the genus Cuphophyllus instead. Description H. virginea on Faroe Islands stamp Basidiocarps are agaricoid, up to 75 mm (3 in) tall, the cap convex at first, becoming flat or slightly depressed when expanded, up to 75 mm (3 in) across. The cap surface is smooth, waxy when damp, hygrophanous and somewhat translucent with a striate margin, white to ivory (rarely with ochre to brownish tints). The lamellae (gills) are waxy, cap-coloured, and decurrent (widely attached to and running down the stipe). The stipe (stem) is smooth, cylindrical or tapering to the base, cap-coloured, and waxy when damp. The spore print is white, the spores (under a microscope) smooth, inamyloid, ellipsoid, about 7.0 to 8.5 by 4.5 to 5.0 Œºm. The species is sometimes parasitized by the mould Paecilomyces marquandii, which colours the lamellae violet. Similar species Hygrocybe russocoriacea is very similar in appearance, but can be distinguished in the field by its strong smell of sandalwood. Hygrocybe berkeleyi is also similar, but fruit bodies are typically larger and non-hygrophanous (it has sometimes been considered a white form of Cuphophyllus pratensis). Distribution and habitat The snowy waxcap is widespread throughout the north temperate zone, occurring in Europe, North America, and northern Asia, and has also been recorded from Australia. Like other waxcaps, it grows in old, unimproved, short-sward grassland (pastures and lawns) in Europe, but in woodland elsewhere. Recent research suggests waxcaps are neither mycorrhizal nor saprotrophic but may be associated with mosses. Conservation In Europe, Cuphophyllus virgineus is typical of waxcap grasslands, a declining habitat due to changing agricultural practices. Cuphophyllus virgineus is one of the commonest species in the genus and is not considered to be of conservation concern (unlike most other waxcaps). In 1997, the species was featured on a postage stamp issued by the Faeroe Islands. Edibility The mushroom is considered a good edible.

This valley is mainly served in Quebec by the route 138 which passes on the west side of the river (from the border), then on the northwest side going towards the mouth. In New York State, the nearby route is Constable Street and State Highway 30. The river surface is generally frozen from mid-December to the end of March. Safe circulation on the ice is generally done from the end of December to the beginning of March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation. Geography This river originates in various rivers including the Little Trout River in the Adirondack Mountains located in upstate New York, United States. Trout River, also called Rivi√®re √† la Truite in French, is a non-navigable and non-buoyant river: it has only of drainage basin that flows between the townships of Elgin and Godmanchester in front of lots granted by the Crown prior to June 1, 1884. This private basin is owned by local residents (private watercourses: article 919. second paragraph, of the Civil Code of Quebec). The property extends to the river bed to the center (or better up to the water): which gives the right to fish and use the bottom in front of the properties (use: article 981. of Civil Code of Quebec). But private rights to the river must also respect those of others: because it is a kind of common property. There would be a legal right of way on private waterways so that people cannot be prevented from crossing the water. It is a municipal watercourse (not navigable), it is under the control of the Quebec Municipal Code and the municipality which can make regulations. Trout River has two dams: the St-Onge Dam located in the hamlet of Trout River in Elgin near the Canada‚ÄìUS border. The other dam is the Hooker Dam, which is located between the hamlet of Kensington in Godmanchester and the path of the second concession to Elgin. The Trout River flows into the Chateauguay River just south of the town of Huntingdon. The municipality of Huntingdon set up a Route 138 rest stop at the confluence of the two rivers.

The case concerned an alleged violation of the Compensation Clause of the United States Constitution when Congress extended Medicare and Social Security taxes to federal judge salaries. Additionally, the case dealt with whether a later increase of federal judge salaries, greater than the new taxes, remedied the potential violation. Background The Compensation Clause to the United States Constitution was written to help protect federal judges from external political pressures. There was a concern in the early United States that without such independence, the judiciary could become \\"dependent on\\" the other branches, which could skew their rulings. The question in Hatter involved this principle and other taxes Congress applied to the judiciary. Congress extended Medicare to federal employees in 1982, including the taxes that were carried with it. Additionally, Congress required federal judges to pay into Social Security. A group of judges filed suit against both taxes, alleging a violation of the Compensation Clause of the Constitution. The Court of Federal Claims found that the judges' Medicare claims were \\"time barred\\" and that a later salary increase \\"cured\\" the Social Security tax increase violation. The group of judges appealed to the Supreme Court, who agreed to review the decision. Opinion of the Court Justice Breyer wrote the majority opinion for the Court, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Kennedy, Souter, and Ginsburg. The opinion argued that the Social Security tax application was problematic as it \\"singled out then- sitting federal judges for unfavorable treatment\\". The determination that the Social Security tax was unconstitutional became the first instance in which the Court invalidated legislation as a discriminatory reduction of compensation. However, the Medicare tax was proper as it was not \\"discriminatory\\". The fact that one of the taxes was just a tax of \\"general application\\" meant that it could also apply to judges. The rule that came out of these decisions was that any \\"direct\\" reduction of judicial salaries is unconstitutional \\"whether or not the reduction is targeted at judges\\". The chances however that Congress would impose a \\"discriminatory\\" tax just on judges in the future are small, and thus the effect of this decision may not be that broad. The Court refused to hear cases after Hatter which dealt with cost-of-living salary changes. Justices Stevens and O'Connor recused themselves from participation in the case. Concurring/Dissenting opinions =Scalia's dissent= Justice Scalia wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. He agreed with the majority that the Social Security tax was unconstitutional but went farther and said the Medicare tax was \\"also unconstitutional\\". He noted the unique nature of compensation rules in relation to the judiciary, which unlike other federal employees except the President, cannot be diminished during their time of service. =Thomas' dissent= Justice Thomas too wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. In a two sentence statement, he simply said he would \\"affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in its entirety\\". His basis was an older case, Evans v. Gore, 253 U.S. 245 (1920). Evans dealt with the application of federal income tax laws to the executive and judiciary. However, the Supreme Court functionally overruled Evans on the 'net reduction' standard.

Plot Tom, Sr. who runs a laundry on the Upper East Side, has succeeded in bringing his younger daughter (Eva) and son (Tom, Jr.) from China to New York to join him, his wife (Mother Fong), and his other children. The family succeeds in establishing itself in American culture by its hard work and devotion to democratic principles. It offers a critique of Americans who do not live up to these ideals. The family welcomes a new daughter-in-law, Flora, an Italian-American. They say \\"you are like a Chinese woman\\" because you \\"work hard all day and have no quarrels with your husband and the parents.\\" In Italy, she replies, \\"a padre is a padre.\\" Another Fong brother becomes an insurance salesman, who becomes infatuated with a nightclub dancer who is interested only in material things. Tom, Jr., the leading character, learns English with a diligence which helps Miss Cartwright, his American teacher, to \\"rediscover the English language.\\" He shows up American students who do not appreciate their own language and do not work hard to master it. He paraphrases the Declaration of Independence into basic English to reveal its importance for the world. He has to learn Mandarin Chinese in addition to his Cantonese to court Elsie, who came from Shanghai, and then has to study literature, both Walt Whitman and Laozi. In the late 1930s, when the Japanese army is invading China, Elsie leaves to return to her homeland to support the war effort. Tom, Sr. is hit by a car while crossing the street, \\"dying a typically American death.\\" The mother of the driver shows up to offer the family compensation money, enough to send Tom, Jr., to college and to finance the opening of their restaurant in Chinatown. Critical reception The Chinese American themes have earned it thoughtful critical attention. Cheng Lok Chua points out that Lin identified with the Fongs as immigrants and showed his solidarity with them as working-class Chinese. He adds that Lin bent reality at a time when immigration laws would have prevented Tom, Sr. from bringing his wife and children. Lin himself was the victim of American discrimination and humiliation, which make the genial tone of the novel quite remarkable, perhaps even disingenuous. Introduction, Chinatown Family, xiii.

Career Haight Ashbury Free Clinics Inaba was one of the original volunteers at the Haight Ashbury Free Clinics in San Francisco which was founded by Dr. David E. Smith in response to the medical needs of the thousands of young people who descended upon San Francisco for the Summer of Love. The Free Clinic opened on June 6, 1967. In 1969, Inaba co-founded the Detoxification and Rehabilitation Unit of the Haight Ashbury Clinic with Skip Gay, M.D., in response to the epidemic of methamphetamine and heroin addiction. As director of detox, Inaba supervised the treatment of some 350,000 addicts and alcoholics who were self-referred. Inaba was the CEO and president of the Haight Ashbury Free Clinics from 1989-2005, as well as the past chairman of the San Francisco Asian American Substance Abuse Task Force. He is also the first lifelong Fellow of the Haight Ashbury Free Clinics. While at the Free Clinic (1967-2005) Inaba had a great interest in the development culturally consistent substance abuse treatment services. Haight Ashbury Free Clinic Benefit Concerts The Clinic was initially funded through proceeds of benefit concerts, many of which were organized by Bill Graham. The first of such benefit concerts took place on July 13, 1967 at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, California. Another, titled \\"Dr. Sunday's Medicine Show\\", took place on October 8, 1967 in San Jose, California. These benefit concerts, organized with promoter Bill Graham (promoter) in the early years of the Clinic, included bands such as Big Brother and the Holding Company, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Ravi Shankar, George Harrison, The Charlatans, Blue Cheer, and Quicksilver Messenger Service. The concerts proved crucial in providing the funding necessary to keep the Clinic doors open during its early years, as traditional sources of funding were not immediately forthcoming. Rock Medicine Through the benefit concerts organized with Bill Graham in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Inaba and Dr. George \\"Skip\\" Gay created The Rock Medicine Services in the spring of 1973. Bill Graham staged two consecutive Saturday concerts at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco, California, featuring The Grateful Dead and Led Zeppelin. Bill Graham asked the clinic to staff a \\"medical emergency care tent\\" during both concerts. These small stadium concerts, about 18,000 at the Dead and 25,000 at Led Zeppelin, evolved into Bill Graham's Days on the Green concert series. The \\"medical emergency care tent\\" became Rock Medicine,Rock Medicine, Haight Ashbury Free Clinics Inc a branch of the Haight Ashbury Free Clinics that still exists today and provides medical care at various Bay Area music concerts and events.

His landmark work was The 1968 Squirrel \\"Migration\\" In The Eastern United States. Flyger was also one of the first wildlife biologists to utilize tranquilizer guns in the 1950s when they were first introduced. In the 1960s, he experimented with dart guns in the Arctic on seals, whales and polar bears. However, seeking a field of study that kept him closer to home, Flyger focused most of his remaining research on squirrels. Background Vagn Folkmann Flyger was born January 14, 1922 in Aalborg, Denmark and his family immigrated to Jamestown, New York in 1923. Their home in Western New York was within walking distance of Chautauqua Lake, in addition to many streams, peat bogs, fields and forests. These environs were teeming with wildlife, and he spent his youth catching an abundance of snakes, insects and other little animals. At a young age, he decided that he wanted to become a biologist, perhaps even an entomologist or herpetologist. Flyger became a U.S. citizen in October 1942 and enlisted in the Army in 1943. He served from 1943‚Äì1946, 18 months of which were in Europe as a medical and surgical technician in the 1263rd combat engineer battalion. Education Flyger attended Cornell University and graduated in 1948 with a bachelor's degree in zoology. In 1952, he received a master's degree in wildlife management from Pennsylvania State University and in 1956 earned a doctoral degree in vertebrate ecology from Johns Hopkins University. His studies focused on mammalian ecology and wildlife habitats. Work Deer in Maryland After graduating from Johns Hopkins, Flyger worked as a research biologist for the state of Maryland at their Chesapeake Biological Laboratory in Solomons, Maryland. He collected extensive data on deer, which assisted in regulating the white-tailed deer population in the state. His methods of analyzing the deer population are still considered foundational in deer management in the state. Flyger also developed the use of a syringe gun (the \\"Cap-Chur Gun\\") which would sedate the deer for transfer and study. In the late 1950s, hunters in Maryland were clamoring for more deer, while, at the same time, the Aberdeen Proving Ground had an overabundance of deer. Using the Cap-Chur Gun and traps, Flyger and his colleagues transferred 1500 white-tailed deer from the Aberdeen Proving Ground into the northern areas of the state where there were little or no deer. Although the hunters were pleased with the restocking, the farmers began experiencing trouble with deer eating their crops. Flyger then developed a method he had learned in the Army during WWII to scare off the deer by setting up strings of M80s, which proved very effective. However, some poachers had their fingers blown off, so the method was abandoned, though Flyger continued to believe that this system had merit. Polar expeditions His work with the syringe tipped arrows in Maryland led Flyger to believe that it might be a useful tool with larger mammals. A Norwegian company gave him the funds to travel to the Arctic to test his equipment on whales. He spent two summers in the Arctic (around Kendall Island in the Northwest Territory) with the Inuit, adapting the devices so that they could function in the extreme cold and be able to penetrate the skin and blubber layers of the whale. In 1966, Flyger and Dr. Martin Schein, traveled to the Arctic Research Laboratory in Point Barrow, Alaska to use the sedation guns on polar bears so that they could be tagged or marked for research about their numbers and movements. The following year, Flyger traveled with an international team of scientists to Svalbard, Norway. At the time of these expeditions, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was interested in utilizing satellites for tracking polar bears, so Flyger and Schein experimented with placing collars (simulating transmitters) on the bears. However, in the end, NASA underwent funding cuts, and the satellite tracking never happened with the polar bears. In the summer of 1963 and 1964, Flyger traveled to Ross Island in the Antarctic to study the effects of three immobilizing drugs on Weddell seals, using the automatic projectile syringe. Squirrel Studies Following his graduation from Cornell, Flyger worked as a game biologist for the state of Maryland, and began his research with squirrels. This led to the discovery that half of the females being killed during the hunting season were either pregnant or nursing. Flyger recommended that the squirrel hunting season be delayed into October, and this has been the schedule since the 1950s. In 1968, the Smithsonian Institution formed the Center for Short-Lived Phenomena, which was established to study short-lived natural phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and other unusual ecological events. Flyger requested to be notified by the Center of any squirrel migrations and, soon after, was informed about an unusual squirrel migration occurring from North Carolina into Tennessee. This was one of the first events in which the center became involved. Flyger examined several hundreds of squirrel carcasses found in the area and wrote his doctoral dissertation on the subject. He determined that the \\"migration\\" was a result of a rise in squirrel births which happened to coincide with a poor acorn crop, causing them to seek food in unfamiliar territories. Flyger devised a number of marking systems for tracking the movements of squirrels in both urban and rural environments, including the use of radio collars. He created nesting boxes to facilitate the study of squirrels along with many feeding devices that challenged the squirrels' intelligence, memory, and agility. He was well known for distributing \\"wanted\\" posters throughout the countryside requesting that road-kill squirrels be sent to the Natural Resources Institute at the University of Maryland, College Park, where he was Chair of the Department of Forestry, Fish and Wildlife. Unfortunately, some people took it upon themselves to mail dead carcasses through the Post Office. However, these and other squirrels that he collected over a half-century provided valuable information about diseases, parasites, population, environmental factors, among other findings. Flyger's decades of research on squirrels included the endangered Delmarva fox squirrel and flying squirrels. His work with flying squirrels was the subject of a BBC documentary. Educator In 1962, Flyger became a faculty member at the University of Maryland's Natural Resources Institute. In addition to his research, he taught at the University for 25 years. He was a well-respected and popular professor at the University, who inspired many students to enter the field of wildlife conservation and mentored many young professionals. One of Flyger's most significant contributions to the field may have been his ability to educate the public about wildlife in an engaging, informative and interesting manner. Flyger was also known for his quick wit and dry humor, and was often interviewed by newspapers, magazines, and other media. The backyard of his home in Silver Spring, Maryland opened into parkland, which made it a refuge for squirrels and other wildlife. Even after his retirement, when he became an Emeritus Professor, it was the site of on-going research, interviews and documentaries. He was interviewed by the National Wildlife Federation, National Geographic, and the BBC in this wooded setting. Publications (Partial list.

Defensive wounds are often found on the hands and forearms, where the victim has raised them to protect the head and face or to fend off an assault, but may also be present on the feet and legs where a victim attempts defense while lying down and kicking out at the assailant. The appearance and nature of the wound varies with the type of weapon used and the location of the injury, and may present as a laceration, abrasion, contusion or bone fracture. Where a victim has time to raise hands or arms before being shot by an assailant, the injury may also present as a gunshot wound. Severe laceration of the palmar surface of the hand or partial amputation of fingers may result from the victim grasping the blade of a weapon during an attack. In forensic pathology the presence of defense wounds is highly indicative of homicide and also proves that the victim was, at least initially, conscious and able to offer some resistance during the attack. Defense wounds may be classified as active or passive. A victim of a knife attack, for example, would receive active defense wounds from grasping at the knife's blade, and passive defense wounds on the back of the hand if it was raised up to protect the face.

In the inter-war period, he worked at the Reich Air Ministry and was one of the German officers most responsible for training the first German paratroopers. Bassenge was Chief of Staff of Luftflotte 2 as it was part of the Blitzkrieg into the Netherlands, Belgium, and France in 1940. He became Chief of Staff of Luftflotte 5 in Norway while it flew into the northern British isles in the Battle of Britain. After being part of a Luftwaffe mission to Romania, he took part in the North African Campaign in 1941 ‚Äì 1943. He was captured there on 9 May 1943, and was held prisoner of war until 2 October 1947. From birth through World War I Gerhard Bassenge was born in Ettlingen, the Grand Duchy of Baden in the German Empire on 18 November 1897.Above the Lines, p. 66. Bassenge began his military career in the early days of World War I, on 4 October 1914, just shy of his 17th birthday. He became an Unteroffizier or noncommissioned officer; he was also a Fahnenjunker or officer candidate. He was assigned as a platoon leader in the Imperial German Army's 29th Infantry Regiment. He was then ranked as a Fahnrich or ensign, the most junior officer rank in the German Army. On 27 January 1915, while still only 17 years of age, he received a field promotion to Leutnant. While in the infantry, he served on both the Western Front and the Eastern Front.Jasta 2, p. 46. Entry into aviation He transferred to the Luftstreitkr√§fte and began pilot training on 1 April 1916. After training, he was assigned to Kampfstaffel 39. After serving with Kampfstaffel 39 for some months, Bassenge was remanded for further training.Above the Lines, p. 66. On 17 January 1917 he began training as a fighter pilot. He was successful and was posted to a fighter squadron, Jagdstaffel 5. On 13 April, he put in his first claim for an aerial victory, over a British pusher fighter; the claim went unconfirmed because he only forced it to land. On 2 May, he was transferred to another fighter unit, the famed Jagdstaffel 2. He was confirmed as a leutnant on 28 June 1917; his commission granted him over two years seniority in rank, back to 18 June 1915. Photos taken of him at about this time show a slender man with an erect carriage standing next to or sitting on his Albatros D.III biplane fighter.Albatros Aces, pp. 14-15. This Albatros, as was the German custom, had been embellished beyond its factory finish of umber and two tones of green. As had all the Jasta 2 aircraft, its tail had been painted white. Its nose, cowling, struts, and wheel covers were painted gray. Bassenge's personal markings were superimposed‚Äìa black and white strip that ran back down the sides of the plane to where a wide black band edged in white encircled the fuselage.Albatros Aces, p. 92. Bassenge used this plane to score his first aerial victoryAlbatros Aces, pp. 14-15, 92. on 20 October 1917. At 1220 hours, he shot down Sopwith Camel serial number B2370 from No. 70 Squadron RFC south of Saint Quentin, France. On 6 November, it was followed by Sopwith Camel s/n B2441 from No. 65 Squadron RFC, destroyed over Staden, Belgium. However, Bassenge was severely wounded. The wound would sideline him until July 1918. Bassenge used a new Fokker D.VII fighterFokker D.VII Aces, p. 69. to demolish another Camel, number D8197, over Fere-en-Tardenois, France in the afternoon of 25 July 1918. There was a lull in his wins after that. He did not destroy another British plane until 27 September; this time, it was another first-line fighter that fell, a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a from No. 32 Squadron RAF that went down over Noyelles at 1735 hours. The following morning, at 0835 hours, it was Camel number F3220 from No. 203 Squadron RAF, destroyed between Ham and Lengelet. Less than a week later, he repeated his feat of back to back victories. On 4 October 1918, a SE.5a from No. 85 Squadron RAF fell over Joncourt, France; the next day, it was a Camel over Cr√®vec≈ìur. Bassenge would not win again before the armistice, and would end the war with seven victories. Interwar period In 1927, Bassenge completed his studies and was granted the title of Dip. Ing. or Certified Engineer. Simultaneously, he was transferred to the Reich Defense Ministry. In 1934, Bassenge transferred from the German Army to the Luftwaffe, which was then forming. His new assignment was as a consultant and Group Leader in the newly founded Reich Air Ministry. In 1937, Bassenge was assigned as Chief of Staff under Generalmajor Kurt Student. On 1 June 1938, he was reassigned to the Reich Air Ministry and seconded to work for the Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe. On 1 October 1938, he was returned for duty in the Air Ministry, working on the Luftwaffe General Staff. He was promoted to Oberst on 1 May 1939; a month later, with the world on the brink of World War II, Bassenge was appointed Chief of Staff of Air Zone Command XVII in Wien, Austria. World War II On 30 January 1940, Gerhard Bassenge was appointed Chief of Staff of Luftflotte 2 under General der Flieger Albert Kesselring. Luftflotte 2 was heavily involved in the Blitzkrieg of the Netherlands and Belgium, as it included General Student and his Fallschirmj√§ger. It was also the air support for the attack on the British Expeditionary Force that ended at Battle of Dunkirk with its consequent evacuation. The Luftflotte then participated in the follow-up attack into France. On 1 August 1940, Bassenge was transferred to be Chief of Staff of Luftflotte 5 in Oslo, Norway under Generaloberst Hans- J√ºrgen Stumpff. On 15 August, Luftflotte 5 became involved in history's first battle waged solely between opposing air forces, the Battle of Britain. However, before that battle ended, Bassenge had once again been transferred; on 5 October 1940, he was appointed Chief of Staff of a Luftwaffe mission to Romania. His next assignment took him to his final theater of service, North Africa. On 24 June 1941, he became the Airfield Area Commandant there. He would serve in that post until 1 October 1942, when he was named commanding officer of the 19th Luftwaffe Field Division.German Order of Battle, p. 317. While serving in this post, he was promoted to Generalmajor on 1 January 1943. One month later, he was appointed to command Fortress Area Tunis-Bizerte, Tunisia Gerhard Bassenge at Trent Park. back row from left to right: Otto Elfeldt, Ferdinand Heim, Gerhard Bassenge front row from left to right: Friedrich Freiherr von Broich, Heinrich Eberbach, Georg Neuffer, Hans Reimann. Bassenge was captured 9 May 1943 at Metline, North Africa by the British. He was hastily transported to Britain, arriving at Camp 11, Trent Park, on 16 May 1943. He was logged into this luxurious camp for high-ranking prisoners as POW 18809. His intake papers note him as having brown hair and blue eyes, being 5' 7 1/2\\" tall, and weighing 162 lbs. His next of kin was listed as Lotte Bassenge. Camp 11 was \\"bugged\\" by British military intelligence, and on 10 July 1943, a wiretap caught Bassenge being informed of war crimes by a horrified Generalleutnant Georg Neuffer.Moral Combat, p. 439. It is not known if Bassenge was previously unaware of Nazi atrocities, or if the conversation caught on the wiretap influenced him, but while in captivity, Bassenge became an advocate of Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma's views. General der Panzertruppe von Thoma, who was held prisoner along with Bassenge, believed that Hitler had gone insane and that the Nazi war effort was doomed. As the majority of German officers held prisoner were fervent Nazis, the views of Bassenge and Thoma caused considerable dissension with the Hitlerites.

Kresse (Amsterdam, 3 December 1921‚ÄìDoorwerth, 12 March 1992) was a Dutch cartoonist. He was the winner of the 1976 Stripschapprijs. Biography Hans G. Kresse, born in the Netherlands in 1921, started his career as a comics artist in 1938 in the scouting magazine De Verkenner. He joined the Toonder Studios in 1944, where he worked on a variety of comics, starting with the typical Toonder-style animal comic Robby, but soon changing to the first of Kresse's realistic works like De Gouden Dolk (1946). It was in this historical realistic style that he would continue to work for the remainder of his career. In the 1950, he was also active as an illustrator for Donald Duck written by Dick Dreux. The same year, he created his magnum opus, the Viking series Eric de Noorman. As was typical for Dutch comics at the time, it was a comic with the text below the drawings instead of inside text balloons. The comic first appeared in the Flemish newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws, and was later also published in the Netherlands and in Wallonia in French. The series continued until 1964, and a spinoff series Erwin, de Zoon van Erik de Noorman started as a regular ballon comic in 1966. During and after those years, Kresse created many one shot comics and contributed numerous illustrations to many Dutch youth magazines. The most famous of his comics of these years are Matho Tonga, Vidocq, Mangas Coloradas and Alain d'Arcy. His second main series, Les Peaux-Rouges, depicting the history of the Native Americans during the Spanish conquests of North America, debuted in 1973. Published at the famous French language editor Casterman, Kresse worked on it until 1982, when he had to retire due to failing eyesight.

John McKenzie became the premier Catholic biblical scholar of the mid-twentieth century; indeed, John Courtney Murray wrote that John McKenzie was \\"the best Catholic theologian he knew of in the United States.\\"Murray, John Courtney (1975). No Famine in the Land: Studies in Honor of John L. McKenzie (1975), Institute for Antiquity and Christianity, page 4. John McKenzie was interested in the Jesuits from an early age. At some significant sacrifice to his family, he was enrolled in a Jesuit boarding high school in St. Mary's, Kansas, where he came first in his class three out of his four years there. After graduating in 1928, he entered the Chicago Province of the Society of Jesus and was ordained a priest in 1939. He was supposed to study theology in Rome, but the onset of World War II made that impossible. Consequently, he and others were required to study instead at the Weston School of Theology in Massachusetts (now the Boston College School of Theology and Ministry). He received his Doctorate in Sacred Theology from Weston. John McKenzie taught for nineteen years at the Jesuit Theologate in West Baden, Indiana, before transferring to Loyola University Chicago. He left Loyola to become the first Catholic Faculty member at the University of Chicago Divinity School. Following this, he taught at the University of Notre Dame, at Seton Hall University, and at DePaul University. He was self-taught in ten languages. His scholarly and popular writings were voluminous. He was much sought after as a lecturer as well. In the English-speaking world, his 900,000-word Dictionary of the Bible remains the most frequently used single- volume biblical dictionary available. At the time of its publication in 1956, a review in the periodical, The Thomist, called his book, The Two-Edged Sword, \\"the most significant Catholic interpretation of the Old Testament ever written in English.\\"Book Review (1967). The Thomist Review Vol. 20, p. 355 It remains in print to this day and continues to be considered, by scholars and non-scholars alike, a masterful reflection on the Old Testament. The New York Times obituary announcing his death said, ‚ÄúRev. John L. McKenzie was a pioneering and outspoken Roman Catholic biblical scholar, (who) through scholarly and popular writings, helped bring about the general acceptance by Catholic scholars and Church authorities of the scientific techniques of investigating Scripture, which had been highly suspect in Catholic circles when he began his career.‚ÄùPeter Steinfels (1991). \\"Rev. John L. McKenzie, 80, Dies; Leader in Catholic Bible Research,\\" New York Times, March 6. In 1965 and 1966 alone, besides the above-noted Dictionary of the Bible, he published The Power and the Wisdom, an interpretation of the New Testament; Authority in the Church, a book arguing that service‚Äîdiakonia‚Äîrather than secular models of government‚Äîdomination‚Äîshould define the Church's understanding and use of authority; a seminal essay on natural law in the New Testament, as well as eleven other articles and nineteen book reviews of scholarly works. He is the author of a number of articles in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (14th edition): Adam and Eve, Hexateuch, Israel, Mizpah, Pentateuch, Zephania, and Zion. From approximately 1954 to 1974 he was considered the dean of Catholic biblical scholars. During this period, he was elected President of the Catholic Biblical Association and became the first Catholic ever elected President of the Society of Biblical Literature. During this period he was also President of probably the largest Anti-Vietnam War organization, Clergy and Laity Concerned, whose founding members also included the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., Rabbi Abraham Heschel, and Reverend William Sloane Coffin. This involvement was the direct result of his being an outspoken and supremely articulate Christian pacifist. In 1971, he transferred as a priest from the Society of Jesus to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Madison, Wisconsin. John L. McKenzie's correspondence was as extensive as his scholarly writings. Although it may be something of an exaggeration, it was said that he never left unanswered a letter written to him, whether complimentary or critical. The exaggeration is probably rooted in two facts: He did give yeoman's service in trying to respond to those who wrote to him, and he firmly believed that the academic owed a debt‚Äî-in justice and in love‚Äî-a debt that required the scholar to share the fruits of his or her work with the everyday person whose work afforded the scholar the leisure, as well as the food, electricity, books, etc. needed to pursue a cognitive discipline in depth. He once wrote: > I think my colleagues in theology and exegesis are open to the charge that > they have become mandarins, who speak only to other mandarins about topics > which are of interest only to mandarins in a style of discourse which is > gibberish to any except mandarins, and one sometimes wonders about them too. > Scholarship is and ought to be a form of public service and not an expensive > enterprise dedicated to the production of a few more mandarins who can spend > a leisurely life in the production of other mandarins. The pointedness of this statement and the self-discipline with which John L. McKenzie responded to those who corresponded with him, as well as his commitment to write not only scholarly theological books and essays, but also to publish the results of his intellectual labors in popular, non-academic prose, all arose directly from an empathic mission that lay deep within him as a human being, a Christian, and a scholar. The mission: to spread the truth of the Good News of Jesus Christ to help free people intellectually, morally, spiritually, and socially to search for truth and to adhere to it once found. For, as he saw it, the task of Christianity, of scholarship, of humanity in general, and of the individual human being is de-conditioning‚Äîfreeing one's mind and oneself, and freeing others, from nurtured untruth in which a personal investment has been made. His was a life of compassion, sharing with others the bread of truth which he had purchased at great price; sharing, because he had taken to heart so deeply the idea that as human beings we are made with the desire to know, that the object of that desire is truth, and that the truth shall set us free to be what we should be. Testimonials to the exceptional quality of Rev. John L. McKenzie's intellect and the superlative character of his scholarship abound. But one in particular deserves to be singled out perhaps, because of who gave it and the place she holds in the history of twentieth-century Catholicism, indeed, the place she holds in twentieth-century Christianity and humanity‚ÄîDorothy Day. On the morning of April 14, 1968, she writes in her diary: ‚ÄúUp at 5:00 and reading The Power and The Wisdom. I thank God for sending me men with such insight as Fr. McKenzie.‚ÄùThe Duty of Delight: The Diaries of Dorothy Day, Image Books, 2008, p. 431. John L. McKenzie concluded his human, priestly, and scholarly life on earth in Claremont, California, assisting as a priest at Our Lady of Assumption Parish, and serving as counselor and friend to scholars and non- scholars‚Äîfrom every point on the compass‚Äîwho thought that he could be of help to them.

Quotes ‚ÄúIf Jesus can be trusted to have said anything at all, he renounced violence: interpreters have preferred to think that his words are irrelevant to politics, which should be discussed without any reference to anything He said, did or was. I shall raise a question or two about this.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, page 136. ‚ÄúThe simple see at once that the ‚Äúway‚Äù of Jesus is very hard to do, but easy to understand. It takes real cleverness and sophisticated intelligence to find ways to evade and distort the clear meaning of what Jesus said.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, page 205 ‚ÄúNo higher model of Christian love can be found than Jesus Christ, whose love was not the affirmation of the goodness of men, but a desire to confer on them a goodness that they lacked.‚Äù The Two-Edged Sword, page, 284. ‚ÄúThe Christian obligation of loving one‚Äôs enemies‚Äîand by implication the sinner‚Äîdoes not require that we cease to recognize him a wicked. There is a world of difference between Christian love toward the sinner and a sentimental sympathy for him. Christian love will spare nothing in order that the one doing evil be redeemed from his condition. Sickly sympathy with the wicked, however, is not true compassion, even for the wicked.‚Äù The Two Edged Sword, pages 284, 285. ‚ÄúJesus taught that violence belongs to the Reign of Satan, and that men must expel violence if they wish to liberate themselves from the Reign of Satan.‚Äú The New Testament Without Illusion, page 33. ‚ÄúWe have tried to produce a form of Christianity that will be tolerable to those who believe that the best way to deal with your enemies is to beat their heads in. And, we have done this. We have produced the Christian ethic of the just war. This is not the New Testament and every theologian knows it.‚Äù How Relevant is the Bible?, page 213. ‚ÄúIf Jesus did not reject any type of violence for any purpose, then we know nothing of him.‚Äù New Testament Without Illusion, page 252 ‚ÄúNo reader of the New Testament, simple or sophisticated, can retain any doubt of Jesus‚Äô position toward violence directed to persons, individual or collective, organized or free enterprise, he rejected it totally.‚Äù National Catholic Reporter, 2/22/80 ‚ÄúThe sharp rejection of the use of arms [Mt 26: 52] is entirely in accord with the teaching and practice of Jesus; and no one else is said to intervene in a scene that certainly would have led to massive violence had someone not stopped it. The rejection of the use of arms is general, not merely a remark adapted to the particular situation.\\" Jerome Biblical Commentary, The Gospel According to Matthew, page 110 ‚ÄúOn only one occasion in the life of Jesus did the question of armed defense arise. This was on the occasion of his arrest in Gethsemane. The defense which the disciples were ready to attempt against the arresting force was refused by Jesus and refused rather sharply. In the Gospel of Matthew the refusal is expanded by saying that those who take the sword shall perish by the sword. This saying is not found in the other Gospels. As far as Christian interest in the saying is concerned, it might just as well have not been found in Matthew. The arrest is not necessarily the original context of this saying. But the evangelist has achieved a certain dramatic contrast by placing the saying in a context where anyone would believe that legitimate self-defense was in place if ever was.‚Äù How Relevant is the Bible?, page138. ‚ÄúJesus presents in His words and life not only a good way of doing things, not only an ideal to be executed whenever it is convenient, but the only way of doing what He did.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, page 124. ‚ÄúJesus in no way accepts violence as a means of controlling violence.‚Äù How Relevant is the Bible?, Page 11. ‚ÄúWhat is Christianity? Many Christians today might say, as many of their predecessors have said, that Christianity is that complex of beliefs for which they are willing to kill. I shall say now that readiness to kill for one‚Äôs beliefs, however orthodox they may be, is essentially unchristian.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, page 43. ‚ÄúAny moral justification of violence must rest on other than biblical grounds.‚Äù National Catholic Reporter, 2/22/80 ‚ÄúThe customary principal of self-defense is rejected by this saying of Jesus; and the customary principle is not replaced by another principle of self-defense.

Jerome Biblical Commentary.\\" The Gospel According to the Evangelist Matthew, page72 ‚ÄúJesus taught us much about how to die; he taught and showed us nothing about how to kill.‚Äù Source, page, 112 ‚ÄúTo say that this power (of love) is impractical in any given circumstance is to say that there are circumstances in which Jesus could not have been himself.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, page 138 ‚ÄúIn this same Gospel of Matthew, we find the fullest exposition of the Christian ethic of nonresistance. This is found in the Sermon on the Mount. As one reads the verses that deal with nonresistance, one must admit that they are nowhere qualified by the hypotheses of situations in which they would not be in place.‚Äù How Relevant is the Bible?, page 138. ‚ÄúMuch of Christian moral tradition has been concerned with finding and explaining exceptions to the ethic on nonresistance for the individual person and for the state.‚Äù How Relevant is the Bible?, page 139. ‚ÄúThe whole Christian thrust against evil in the Gospels is pretty much summed up under the main phrase‚Äînonresistance. It never suggests that the Christian can resolve the problem of evil which we encounter by what we call resistance. I mean, of course, Jesus does not yield to it, but he does not apply violence to it. He suffers it.‚Äù Protest, Pacifism and Politics, page 54. ‚ÄúThe power of Jesus does not engage in fights; he himself is the supreme example of his own precept not to resist evil. He is also the supreme demonstration that evil is overcome by not resisting it; nothing he said or did implies that the application of power against evil has any effect.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, page 103. ‚ÄúHis own death illustrates better than anything else his principle of not resisting evil. (Mt 5:39) That evil is overcome by nonresistance has been comprehended by very few Christians. These few were convinced that Jesus presented in his words and life not only a good way of doing things, not only an ideal to be executed whenever it is convenient but the only way of doing what he did. They did this in pure faith, because there is no reasonable motive for acting in the way which he shows.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, page 107. ‚ÄúLove of neighbor is extended to all people; by loving one‚Äôs enemies one ceases to have enemies.‚Äù Light on the Gospels. Page 39 ‚ÄúThe saying of Jesus that one must love one‚Äôs enemies applies both to personal enemies (who may be one‚Äôs neighbors) as well as to members of hostile groups.‚Äù Old Testament Without Illusion, page 254 ‚ÄúLove within one‚Äôs group or fellowship is merely a natural and universal human trait.‚Äù Jerome Biblical Commentary, page 72 ‚ÄúThe theory of the just war goes back to the efforts of the Christian community to reconcile itself to a practice, which it really knew (emphasis in the original) in its Christian heart of hearts that it couldn‚Äôt countenance.‚Äù Protest, Pacifism and Politics, page 53. ‚ÄúThe principles of life which we attribute to Jesus make the theology of the holy war quite impossible. The life, which Jesus proclaimed, cannot be fostered, advanced, or protected by any kind of war, holy or unholy. Jesus taught people how to die, not how to kill. The holy war has certainly been a major block in proclamation of authentic and integral Christianity.‚Äù Old Testament Without Illusion, page 86. ‚ÄúThe Gospel is more than the life of a single person; it is a recital of the act of God.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, page 36. ‚ÄúSalvation, we have said, consisted in becoming fully human‚Äînot fully a Jew, a Greek, a European or a white American. To choose to be these or any similar denomination is to choose to remain small.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, page 212. ‚ÄúJohn said that the Christian cannot prove his love of God except by his love of man. Matthew makes it very clear that it is not really proved unless the person we love is an enemy. The Christian can be an object of enmity, but not its subject: one who is loved ceases to be an enemy.'Love of one's enemies' is a contradiction in terms; and Christians who think they are doing well when they love their enemies are often quite careful to make it clear that they remain enemies. The Christian loves his or her enemies as Christ loved man hostile to God. He is an agent of reconciliation and a persevering agent. God has revealed to the Christian a value in his fellow lumps of clay which they do not have by their nature. Reason demands moderation in love as in all things; faith destroys moderation here. Faith tolerates a moderate love of one's fellow human beings no more than it tolerates a moderate love between God and man.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, page 231. ‚ÄúThe state is not an object of redemption. The state is one of the consequences of sin, like disease, concupiscence and mortality.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, page 156. ‚ÄúThe state is a collection of persons. Strictly speaking 'the state' does nothing. 'The 'state\\" is men in action. We cannot blame 'the State' as if it were a responsible person. People do things in crowds which they will not do alone. The Christian must look at 'the State' as the pressure of other people. He cannot share their desires and yield to their pressures simply because they outnumber him. The capacity of 'the State' to do evil makes it quite clear that the Christian is not free to let 'the State' make his decisions for him. He knows that men hide behind a crowd and find there an outlet for desires which they usually mask or restrain...If 'the State' becomes the supreme judge of good and evil in public affairs, it can demand unquestioning obedience in its service. It is the demonic quality of 'the State' that it tends to become god.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, pages 248, 250. ‚ÄúWhat really determines the state to be un-Christian is the basis of its ethics. The ethics of the state are the ethics of survival. States live in a moral jungle. Retaliation justifies anything. The supreme good of the state is that it continues to exist; no other good can be maintained if that good threatens survival When we look at the means by which the state achieves it ends, certain dissonances between public morality and Christian morality appear. The state does not love its enemies. It does distinguish very sharply between Jew, Greek, Scythian and other national and racial groups. Public morality is not Christian. My point is not only that the state is not Christian, but that it cannot be Christian. The ethical theory of the state is that the state is not a subject of moral obligation. Its members are subjects of moral obligations, but only as individual persons. When they assemble into a political society, they are not bound by Christian principles. They may decide upon actions which if done by individuals would be murder, arson, theft, and mendacity. One looks for this exception in vain in the New Testament.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, pages 245, 247. ‚ÄúI believe that I have dwelt at length sufficient for my purposes on politics as the institutionalization of the will of some human beings imposed upon others. From pre-dynastic Egypt (which means earlier than 2800 B. C.) there is a work of art known as the palette of Narmer. It represents the victorious Narmer standing over a defeated enemy chieftain seated on the ground. In one hand he grasped the hair of the enemy; in the other hand he brandishes an enormous mace with which he is about to bash in the enemy's skull. Narmer meant it when he said, \\"You do it my way or I'll knock your block off.\\" He is the first statesman in history to be portrayed doing his thing. I am surprised that a copy of the palette of Narmer is not hung in foreign offices all over the world; it ought to be, at least in the foreign offices of those nations that think they can play Narmer.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, pages 119, 124. ‚ÄúThe offer of power over the kingdoms of the world is placed third by Matthew and second by Luke. Jesus rejects the offer with a quotation from Deuteronomy (6:13) in which it is commanded that worship be given to Yahweh alone. Certainly the story means that secular power is not to be acquired at the price of worship of Satan. But do we grasp the full import of the story if we think that the only thing wrong with the offer of secular power is that it came from Satan? In the New Testament the ‚Äúworld‚Äù in the pejorative sense is the realm of the power and authority of Satan: the reign of God is opposed to this power and the struggle between the two reigns is constant and deadly. St. Ignatius Loyola made this the theme of the meditation on the Two Standards in his Spiritual Exercises. Like most Christian interpreters from early time, he did not question the implicit assertion in the temptation narrative that secular power is Satan's to give. The offer is not rejected because Satan is unable to deliver what he promises; it is rejected because secular power is altogether inept for the mission of Jesus, indeed because the use of secular power is hostile to the mission of Jesus.‚Äù Authority in the Church, pages 28-29. ‚ÄúIn the Baptismal formula a renunciation of Satan and all his works and all his pomps is pronounced just before Baptism. The Christian needs to look carefully at what the works and pomps of Satan may include. They do not mean only sin; the Church knows the word for sin, and if it wished to use it in this formula it could have done so. The works and pomps of Satan are all those things which are alleged to be just as good as the power of the Spirit of Christ, and far more realistic and practical.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, pages 148-149. ‚ÄúReason has its place in Christian morality in finding ways to fulfill the difficult and 'unrealistic' commandments of love, not how to evade them and substitute something else far more natural and practical and therefore just as good.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, page 232. ‚ÄúBoth the lust for power and the lust for wealth are in direct and violent opposition to the Gospel; Jesus renounced both lusts as a means of accomplishing His mission, and His Church is unfaithful to Him when she stoops to the use of either.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, page 290. ‚ÄúI do care when my friends are disturbed because of me and even find me offensive. But, it is impossible for me to share their faith in the political process and to believe that anything will be accomplished through politics to change or even to improve temporarily the wretched human condition. I have no faith in politics simply because I have dabbled in history. I judge politics by its record, which is now 5000 years old. Politics has never produced the good life for any but a few in any generation, and that has been produced only by the infliction of misery upon many. It is no different in the contemporary generation. There is still blood on every commodity we use. I was reminded of it again this morning when I took my breakfast of orange juice, cereal, a banana and coffee. Every one of those damn items got to my table at the cost some human misery, not my own.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, page 130. ‚ÄúThe attitudes and the habits and the skills and the ethics which go into the prosecution of a successful war are the same attitudes, habits, skills and ethics which go into the prosecution of any successful political effort. They can be summed up and illustrated in the relief sculpture of that early politician Narmer, which says, \\"You do it my way or I'll knock your block off.\\" I appreciate the faith in the political process exhibited by so many of my friends; I cannot share it because it is faith in morally justifiable rape.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, pages 130, 131. ‚ÄúThe power which destroys all other powers is the power of love, the love of God revealed and active in Jesus Christ. God revealed in Jesus that He loves man and will deliver him through love and through nothing else.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, page 112. ‚ÄúTo power, in the vulgar sense, one renders submission, admiration, obedience and other such responses; the response to the love revealed in Jesus must come from the person, and it must come with freedom. The power of love has its own way of action and it is not the way of compulsion. One would think that this revelation would have expelled compulsion from the Christian community once and for all. The power of love is not the power to dominate but the power to communicate self; and the response is communication, tending toward complete identity.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, page 113. ‚ÄúThe saving act of Jesus is an act of love of the type which He recommends in the Gospels. He loves God by loving His fellow men. Theologians distinguish the \\"God-ward\\" and \\"man-ward\\" aspects of the saving act; but the New Testament does not use such distinctions. The saving act is all God-ward and all man-ward; it moves toward God by moving toward man, as Jesus tells His disciples they also must do. And He leaves no room for man to move toward God except through his fellow man. The saving act is unitive: it establishes man in a new community of which God Himself in Jesus Christ is a member. There is a subtle Christian logic in John 13:34: 'A new commandment I give you, that you should love one another as I have loved you.'\\" A more humanly reasonable logic would conclude: \\"...that you love me as I have loved you.\\" And this we would conclude, were not the New Testament so insistent upon its own logic...The disasters of Israel in the Old Testament arise from Israel's refusal to submit itself to the will of God; and ultimately man is proved helpless in the face of the evil which he himself has wrought. He has no hope of recovery or of survival except in the saving act of God.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, pages 108, 115. ‚ÄúNeither the state nor the social order is Christian just because most of the people engaged in them are Christian. We may be attempting to establish the Reign of God by means other than those which God has revealed to us...The beneficent power which Jesus wielded could not be used in self-defense. He would have been unfaithful to His own teaching and example if He had employed what is called legitimate self defense; and no one has yet to arise to say that Jesus was not better entitled to legitimate self defense than any person who has ever lived. The words of Jesus in the Gospel make it so clear so often that a person must leave his past behind that they need no expressed quotation. They mean that a person allows nothing in his past, his culture, his involvement with family, social, political or economic life to inhibit the act of love, the love of his fellow man in Jesus Christ. A list of the accepted inhibitions of love would be familiar and tedious; we can mention race, nation, property, job, ambition, the duty of supporting one's family‚Äîor perhaps in a word, the \\"duty of protecting the investment.\\" It is not easy to see that the investment may be precisely and without doubt the old man of sin to which we must die.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, pages 106, 112, 117. ‚ÄúWere the morality of law based on reason and nature the supreme morality of man, the Gospel need not have included a moral revolution. Christian morality must be primarily Christian. Christian moral thinking cannot be based on what is convenient to human nature. It must think of historic man, fallen and redeemed. Christian morality will consider what man can and cannot do; its conclusions will not be those of reason and nature. The moral ideal of the Christian is known by the revelation of God in Jesus Christ. The means by which the Christian can attain this ideal is the gift of grace known through the revelation of God. When reason considers nature and abstracts from these things, reason is not considering reality. This should be obvious; yet solutions to moral problems are often alleged by Christians which are devised as if the incarnation had not occurred.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, pages 223-224. ‚ÄúThe Christian obligation of loving one‚Äôs enemies‚Äîand by implication the sinner‚Äîdoes not require that we cease to recognize him a wicked. There is a world of difference between Christian love toward the sinner and a sentimental sympathy for him. Christian love will spare nothing in order that the one doing evil be redeemed from his condition. Sickly sympathy with the wicked, however, is not true compassion, even for the wicked.‚Äù The Two Edge Sword, pages 285. ‚ÄúIt is a common misconception of Old Testament prophecy that it means prediction...Prophecy discloses the nature and character of God and the implications of the divine nature and character for human thought and action. It is insight into the moral will of God and the reality of sin‚Ä¶Prophecy places the integrity of the one God above any national or patriotic consideration.‚Äù Dictionary of the Bible, page 695-698 ‚ÄúIs there a prophecy which is not uttered by authority in the Church but uttered to authority? The nature of prophecy and the nature of the Church indicate that prophecy belongs to the whole Church, not to the Church officers alone, and that the officers can hear prophecy as well as speak it. The history of the Church attests to the need of prophecy within the Church. Prophecy within the Church is a remedy for corruption on all levels. There are times when the officers fail to speak as they ought. There are times when the hierarchy itself needs to be redeemed from corruption. Prophecy is the only agency of the Spirit through which any control is exercised over the officers themselves and through which those defects and evils can be corrected, which it cannot be assumed the officers themselves will correct. There can be no doubt that the usual hostility which we see existing in the Old Testament between prophecy and the officers of Israel is continued in the history of the Church. It is part of the demonic in man that prophecy must usually meet Church authority on the level of hostility. The officers of the Church, however, are by no means the only members of the Church who are hostile to prophecy.‚Äù Authority in the Church, pages 134-140. ‚ÄúJesus uses the phrase 'to deny oneself' to end one's former existence. Repentance is a departure from the morality of reason and nature that one may live on a higher moral plane...The morality of reason and nature is not the morality which continues the life of Christ; and therefore the Christian repents of this morality...Repentance means that the Christian leaves no obstacle to the power of the Spirit of Christ, that he renounces any personal security which reposes on his own endowments or achievements or on any achievement that is purely human and secular. He resolves that he will substitute nothing for the power and work of the Spirit of Christ, no matter how good, how attractive, how beneficent the substitute seems to be.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, pages 147, 148. ‚ÄúThe Christian knows that his love is the active presence of God in the world; if he lacks it, he takes away God's presence from the only place where he can put it. He has come between his neighbor and the saving love of Jesus Christ.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, page 232. ‚ÄúIf the Christian is true to his Christian love, it may kill him, impoverish him, or disgrace him. In any hypothesis he is sure to lose at least some of those goods of this world which Jesus took some trouble to point out are of no importance.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, Page 232. ‚ÄúIt is not without interest that in the New Testament the words that signify vocation are used only of vocation to faith, not to any particular state within the Church. A person is called to be a Christian, and this means he or she is called to be one in whom Christ lives. There is no Christian who cannot bear witness to the risen Christ. Every Christian is a witness all the time. This is the fundamental vocation of the Christian. He is the living Christ; and if he does not manifest Christ, no one else will do it in his state or condition. There was a logical means of evasion for most Christians who have been faced with the choice of martyrdom. Lesser crises do not make this so luminously evident; one can always find a reason for putting off the witness in any particular situation. Perhaps we shall evade less frequently if we remind ourselves that each man bears witness by his own independent and responsible choices.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, page 193. ‚ÄúThe power of love is seen in the death of Jesus; it is seen more fully in His resurrection. For love is a communication of self; and the Christian is not identified with God in Jesus unless he is identified with Jesus risen. Christ lives. The life of a Christian is not the imitation of a dead hero‚Äîand it is worth noticing that it can become just that. The Christian lives in Christ, and Christ lives in the Christian. Death is the end of a life and the end of a world; the resurrection is the beginning of a new life and a new world. It is the reenactment of the story of Genesis 2. God again breathes into man the spirit of life (Gn 2:7), but this is the spirit of eternal life. It is a new beginning. The potentialities of man are no longer inhibited by the dominion of Sin-Death. The new life conferred upon man is the life of Jesus. The resurrection is the beginning of a new life and a new world in which Jesus is living. The revolutionary point in the Christian event is the enduring presence of God's love in Jesus Christ, the enduring presence of the power which entered the world in the incarnation. Because of this power man is enabled in any condition to live the life of Jesus and to continue in his own person the love which is the saving act. The resurrection is the climax of the saving act.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, pages 119-121. ‚ÄúReal wealth (opulence) is now what it has always been, an unlimited amount of people to do your work for you at wages which are high enough to keep them alive and working, and low enough to keep them too tired to be ambitious. I believe we still do not know how the Pyramids were built. We do know that they were the work of a vast pool of unskilled forced labor. I suspect modern entrepreneurs have little to learn from the Pharaohs about bringing large masses of cheap labor into submission...Remove the element of human exploitation from the history of western civilization and how much 'progress' would be left. Child labor is as old as children and as recent as the morning groceries in western civilization. The whole fabric of Western civilization is totally interwoven with the need for cheap unskilled labor. There is a certain amount of dirty work that must be done to sustain the fabric of civilized living that no one is going to do unless they are forced by some compulsion (maybe fear of starvation). Civilized living might be roughly defined as the skill of living without doing the dirty work and getting someone else to do it.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, pages 61, 65. \\"As for you, you rich, your wealth has rotted, your fine ward-robe has grown moth eaten, your gold and silver have corroded and their corrosion is testimony against you; it will devour your flesh like fire. See what you have stored up for yourselves for the last days. Here, crying aloud, are the wages you withheld from the farmhands who harvested your fields. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of host. You have lived in wanton luxury on the earth; you have fattened yourselves for the day of slaughter. You condemned, and even killed the just man\\" (James 5:1-6)... In 2 Corinthians 8-9 Paul simply says that the superfluity of some should compensate for the privation of others. When anyone is in need anyone who is not has superfluous goods. Paul was ignorant of economics or social engineering; but if there were those in dire need who were not helped, he knew the reason why help was refused and it was not the complexity of the problem.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, pages 83, 91. ‚ÄúThe sayings of Jesus about the rich, as unsympathetic as they are, contain nothing like the ferocious invective of James 5: 1-6. James echoes some of the Old Testament prophets (Am 2:6-8, 6:3-7; Is 3:14-15, 10; 1-4; Mi 2:1-3). Jesus does not. Whatever we read in the Gospels should be read as the words of One who calls sinners to repentance and who excludes no one, even scribes and Pharisees, from His call...In His saying, however, about the rich man whom He invites to renounce his wealth and become His disciple‚Äî\\"How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the Kingdom of God\\" (Mk 10:17-20; Mt 19:16-30; Lk 18:18-30)‚ÄîJesus goes beyond the rebuke of the rich uttered by James, the Old Testament prophets and other sources. Jesus is reported as clearly saying that the rich man, just because of his wealth, cannot enter the Reign of God. This may have been what Jesus meant when He said, \\"Woe to you rich, for you have your consolation now\\" (Lk 6:24). It may help at this point if we clear away some exegetical rubbish. If the \\"needle's eye\\" were a narrow Jerusalem gate through which a loaded camel could not be led, then one got the camel through the gate by unloading the camel...Being rich, like being a scribe or a Pharisee, is not an inescapable destiny of spiritual ruin.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, pages 84, 85, 94. ‚ÄúA Roman administrator was about as religious as the late Winston Churchill. War has always been organized murder, arson and pillage. Modern war has achieved success in these enterprises which far exceeds the successes of earlier wars. Those of us, who are old enough, can remember that modern war can be conducted only by those who are ready to renounce all principles of Christian morality...Often there is no Christian way of doing this or that, e.g., engaging in war or the merchandising of heroin.‚Äù The New Testament Without Illusion, page 228, 232. ‚ÄúOur [United States'] history of violence has placed us under God's judgment... H. Rap Brown said that violence is as American as cherry pie. The statement needs correction on two counts. First, he should have said apple pie. Secondly, he should have said white violence; we Caucasians have never admitted the right of the black man, the red man, the yellow man or the brown man to block the march of white civilization by the use of violence. I do not think Mr. Brown knows how violent the white man is and he ought to know better than I do. I can support the thesis that the United States of America is the most violent nation in recorded history, including such thugs as the Assyrians, the Romans, and the much-overrated Mongols and Tartars. No nation has ever killed so many people, citizens and aliens, in so short a time. We have inherited all the violent traditions of Christian Europe together with our own violent tradition of the frontier; and if one goes back beyond the United States proper to the colonies from which the nation arose, the tradition is there from the beginning. The American Indians had nothing like the European tradition of violence, but they were acquainted with primitive forms of violence which they used to express their resentment towards white men moving onto their land. The God-fearing Christians of Massachusetts exterminated the Pequot, man, woman and child, and set the style for the treatment of the Amerind, which was maintained until 1890. That white America has turned soft and civilized in these later days, I do not believe. It is customary‚Äîwith apology to the Jews‚Äî to call this a Christian nation. This statement is so manifestly false that one does not know how to frame the denial. If anyone counts on the Christian beliefs and habits of white Americans to restrain their violence, forget it.‚Äù Did I Say That? pages 69,70, 72. ‚ÄúHere in the United States we were doing it (genocide) to Native Americans before anyone ever heard of Hitler, and with such traditions it should not be too hard to resume it if we are pressed.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, page 254. ‚ÄúLove‚Äîthe love of God for human beings, of human beings for God, and of human beings for human beings‚Äîis both the dominant pathos and the central moral theme of the New Testament. There is no book of the New Testament in which love is not mentioned, and the kind of love which is specifically Christian was so much a novelty that to express its revolutionary significance, it was necessary to infuse new meaning into a Greek word rarely seen in profane literature: 'agape'.\\" Mastering the Meaning of the Bible, page 29. ‚ÄúThe personal transformation of the Christian is a mystery that cannot be pierced; but the effects of the transformation are set forth clearly‚Äîwith such clarity, in fact, that Christians sometimes try to make them more obscure than they are. The pivot of the Christian moral revolution is love [agape]. This is the entirely new and unique feature of Christian moral teaching; it is not the center of a moral structure, it is the entire moral structure. No one questions the centrality of love in New Testament morality; it is questionable whether Christians have always grasped how different it is and how total it is. I venture to state its totality by saying that in the New Testament and act which is not an act of love has no moral value at all. There is no moral action in Christian life except the act of love.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, pages 229, 230. ‚ÄúLove is the supreme motivation of the officers and members of the Church; with this motivation anything like a power structure is forever excluded from the Church. Love is the only power which the New Testament knows. The transformation of the Church into a power structure is not confirmation of authority, but a perversion of authority. Authoritarian power is foreign to every line in the New Testament in which authority is mentioned‚Ä¶ Power, more than other things, recommends itself as a means for a noble end. Perhaps even as the sole means by which great good can be accomplished. It is not always easy to discern that when one puts one's faith in power, one effectively gives up one's faith in the Spirit of Jesus Christ.‚Äù Authority in the Church, pages 76, 85, 130. ‚ÄúThe New Testament speaks of love because it rises out of an uncreated love. The Christian event is not violent; and its effect are not felt through vulgar power. Jesus Himself spoke of its power in the parables of the leaven and the mustard seed. It arouses no hot passions and it does not divide except when rejected: Jesus, the Word of God, said He came to bring not peace but the sword. [\\"The word of God is living and effective, sharper than any two-edged sword, penetrating even between soul and spirit, joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart\\" Heb 4:12.] Man's resistance to the inbreak of God creates a situation compared to which most revolutions are child's play. The Christian event, however, moves not to take anything away, but to give man something, love. Man resists it. Man is not ready for love. He never has been. Yet, it is the one enduring reality in the created world, and in it man achieves enduring reality and value.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, pages, 292, 293. ‚ÄúI cannot, if I profess to be a Christian, support any war as a means to achieve any human objective, no matter how noble it may be.‚Äù Source, page 109. ‚ÄúReason demands moderation in love as in all things; faith destroys moderation here. Faith in Jesus Christ tolerates a moderate love of one's fellow man no more than it tolerates a moderate love between God and man.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, page 231. ‚ÄúI know a woman who is an authentic pacifist. Of crime she says simply that she will not resist, that she would meet the criminal as one in dire need, that she would give him what he demanded because he is in dire need. Our ethics of crime and punishment are the same as our ethics of the just war. In both issues the existing ethical forms must be shattered; to coin a phrase, you cannot put new wine in old wine skins. My friend has shattered them. She believe that Jesus has made the only pertinent remark to the question; that we must forgive, that we must bear iniquity, that we must go the second mile, and give the cloak in addition to the shirt and turn the other cheek. I hope she is not found dying on the street some day; but if she should be, she would regard this as a redemptive work. The criminal, like the law-abiding citizen, will be saved only by Christ-like love. He has to be taught the meaning of that love by experiencing it.‚Äù Did I Say That?, pages 36, 37. ‚ÄúThe scholar is considered a threat to the faith of the unlearned because he or she proposes opinions and conclusions which cannot be reconciled with popular belief. Reasons are found why scholars should not disturb popular belief even when it is in error, for it is alleged that it is better to leave people in error, which they have so long cherished and from which they have reaped so much devotion, rather than shock and disturb them with the truth. This principle by logical dexterity is maintained together with another favorite principle, the principle that 'error has no right to exist'.\\" When both principles are applied, it means that the scholar should propose nothing which might possibly be erroneous, while the faithful are free to retain errors as long as they are old errors and not new errors. The faith of many has been shaken when the teaching of the Church has been reduced to less that its full truth; the faith of just as many, or more, has been shaken when unenlightened teachers impose upon them as beliefs of the Church things which are not true.‚Äù Myths and Realities, pages 30, 31. ‚ÄúLike all my contemporaries on seminary faculties, I had been reared on the ethics of the just war... We were all taught the traditional Catholic morality that while killing a person is morally neutral, bedding him or her is intrinsically evil. We may find reasons for doing away with a person, but we can never find a moral justification for bedding the person, except marriage. There is something fallacious about the thinking which finds illicit sexual relations intrinsically evil but killing people morally neutral: all you need is a sufficiently good reason. Why that does not work for sexual intercourse I do not know‚Ä¶.(But) I never thought I would live long enough to see carnal intercourse become as morally neutral as killing. Modern science and philosophy have made of carnal intercourse a 'meaningful interpersonal relations.' To me the 'meaningful interpersonal relations' is just as phony a piece of morality as the just war theory. I call them both phony.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, page, 11, 13, 126. \\"I know, and perhaps I should say, that the Catholic church has been for centuries a kept church, the chaplains and spiritual lackeys of the rich and the powerful. It has not done its duty to proclaim to the wealthy as well as to the poor that those who have more should bring equality to pass by sharing what they have with those who have less to the point where there is a sufficiency for all and superabundance for none.\\" Source, p. 113 \\"The first question is this: does liberation theology invite me to engage in a war, and indeed, in a class war, the ugliest kind of strife known, where humanity most quickly and surely becomes inhuman? Perhaps that is not the meaning of the invitation; but unless I am totally bereft of my wits, my mail and certain publications contain invitations to watch over the garments of those who throw stones, to put it mildly. These are invitations to support political activities with purposes which cannot be realistically achieved without violence, and a violence which will be carried on without quarter until the extermination of the enemies. Possibly I ask no more than a moderation of rhetoric. Revolutions have always fed upon inflated rhetoric. If one reads the rhetoric of the rebellious colonies of North America in 1776, one would never suspect that the rebellion was a coalition of oligarchs, the slave traders and the rumrunners of Boston and the slave-owning planters of Virginia. These wealthy middle-class gentlemen were hardly those who claims were being forged on the plains of Boston. I am not suggesting an analogy, merely pointing out that one learns to be skeptical about revolutionary rhetoric. It all sounds very much alike; and if it can make George Washington and John Adams victims of an oppressive tyrant, it could sell refrigerators to Eskimos.\\" Source, page 109 ‚ÄúI am not questioning the integrity of any liberation theologian‚Äôs struggle to free theology from its historic role of intellectual lackey to the ruling propertied class...But a reason for rejecting liberation theology is its ambiguity about the use of violence. As far as I can see they have bought the ethics of the just war or just revolution.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, page 192. ‚ÄúIt takes very little skill in speech or writing to say clearly that one rejects violence whether it is committed by the oppressor or the oppressed, and no theological education to see that Jesus with a machine gun does not come off as an authentic figure.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, page 195 ‚ÄúIf the Roman Catholic Church were to decide to join the Mennonites in refusing violence, I doubt whether our harmonious relations with the government would endure the day after the decision.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, pages 159. ‚ÄúI believe that both here and elsewhere the Church can avoid persecution by surviving as it has so far, that is by being the lackey of the establishment of wealth and power, that is, by not being the Church.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, page 218. ‚ÄúWe have tried to produce a form of Christianity that will be tolerable to those who believe that the best way to deal with your enemies is to beat their heads in. And, we have done this. We have produced the Christian ethic of the just war. This is not the New Testament, and every theologian knows it.‚Äù How Relevant is the Bible?, page 213. ‚ÄúThe duty of the proclamation of the Gospel has often included the danger that someone would get killed. Jesus Himself said that this danger was nearest to the proclaimer. He said in the same context that the proclaimer must have trust in the Father, who can do things impossible to diplomacy. The radical reality of the Gospels is the reality of grace and there is just no calculating what grace can do.‚Äù Did I Say That?, page 142, ‚ÄúMay one withhold the proclamation of Gospel in order to save innocent lives? [Which innocent lives?] From the beginning of the Church we have observed that the proclamation of the Gospel has been risky. The risk is never an excuse for suppressing the Gospel. What assurance can we have that silence will save innocent lives? The pilgrim Church can learn much from the experience of the Second World War. One wonders if it has learned anything. The vacuum of public moral leadership which Pius XII thought he could not afford to fill is still there.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, page 88. ‚ÄúI have said elsewhere that Jesus is the Messiah of Judaism and that He can only be understood as the Messiah of Judaism. I stand by this observation; but I do not believe it obliges me to find faith in Jesus Messiah in the Old Testament nor to base faith in Jesus Messiah in the Old Testament. Jesus transformed the idea of Messiah when He fulfilled it. The total reality of Jesus Messiah is found nowhere in the Old Testament, not even in its totality. Jesus, however, could have emerged from nothing except Israel and the Old Testament; but the study of the Old Testament does not demand that Jesus Messiah emerge from it...It is the history of Israel that sets Jesus apart from all culture-heroes, king- saviors, cosmic men, and mythological bearers of life; or, in modern terms political saviors, economic prophets, scientific sages, military heroes, and psychotherapists bearers of life. It is remarkable when one reflects that only as the Savior of Israel can Jesus be recognized as none of these other things. The role of Jesus can be protected from distortion only by holding fast its connection with Biblical antecedents: a non-Israelite, non-Biblical Jesus makes no sense.‚Äù A Theology of the Old Testament, pages 28, 322. ‚ÄúI have been a convinced pacifist for twenty years [c.1953]. This conviction began with the teaching of the Old Testament prophets...I have, however, sat in judgment on Old Testament writers. The Christian faith makes demands which are incompatible even with the religion of which the prophets are one of its components. As Jesus cannot be understood without the Old Testament, so He is not found in His full reality in the Old Testament. Jesus arises from the categories of the Old Testament but He surpasses them.‚Äù A Theology of the Old Testament, pages 24, 323. ‚ÄúThe Old Testament contains many statements of doctrine which Christians cannot believe and of morality which Christians cannot practice. As far as I can tell, the bloodthirsty Israelites of David's time or the bloodthirsty Romans of Jesus' time were quite as ready for the Gospel as are my contemporaries. The principles of life which we attribute to Jesus make the theology of the holy war quite impossible. The life which Jesus proclaimed cannot be fostered, advanced, or protected by any kind of war, holy or unholy. Surely, one may say, there must be situations in which the conflict between good and evil can be perceived in elemental terms, where a Christian can indeed take sides without compromising with evil. I wish I could find such instances; and I wish to leave no doubt that it is not mere cynicism which leads me to say this. It seems a safe general statement to say that in the wars of which we have any information there has been no side which God could have taken without dishonoring Himself.‚Äù The Old Testament Without Illusion, page 86, 259, 263. ‚ÄúThe Savior God of Second Isaiah [and his Suffering Servant] would have been gibberish to David‚Ä¶The Biblical revelation‚Äîif I may use the word‚Äîis a revelation of human potentialities which are first seen as worthy of God, and then as demanded by the reality of God. These potentialities are then demanded by God of human beings, and ultimately made possible by God; this is one of the meanings of grace. I simply do not believe in the Great Warrior God who exterminated the Canaanites. Some who share my faith do. They also profess belief in Jesus Christ the Son of God who said that he who would save his life must lose it, and who implied that a good way to lose it quickly is to love those who hate you and pray for those who persecute you. How does one speak of a god who exhibits both these features [Great Warrior and love of enemies]? I am compelled to say simply that he does not exist, and that those who profess this monstrous faith worship an idol. That they are sincere touches me lightly: so I suppose were most of the worshippers of Baal and Anath, and most witch-burners.‚Äù Religion and the Humanizing of Man, Plenary Address, International Congress of Learned Societies in the Field of Religion, Trinity College (1972) ‚ÄúThe fourth Servant Song (Is 52:13-53:12) is the crux interpretum of the Old Testament. The idea of mission is clear. We need to know, however, who is the subject of the mission and to whom the mission is directed. It is the very ambiguity of these questions which permitted Christian interpreters, beginning in the New Testament, to affirm that the passage is a prediction of the redeeming death of Christ. In the opinion of many Jesus Himself interpreted His role in terms of the Suffering Servant. The author of the Targum of Isaiah did not think it applicable to Israel, or indeed to any situation he could think of, for he transformed the passage into a statement of the victory of the conquering King Messiah. The idea of mission as a proclamation of revealed doctrine could be understood and accepted. But mission as the acceptance of undeserved judgment was too much for this scribe as it has been too much for most readers of the Servant Songs and of the Gospels.‚Äù A Theology of the Old Testament, page 297. ‚ÄúBoth for Jews and Greeks the proclamation of the Suffering Servant was a negation of their highest values. The early Church attributed the proclamation of this theme to Jesus Himself and no convincing reason has been urged to show it should be attributed to another. It is as deeply imbedded in the Gospels as anything else; to repeat what I have said in other connections, if this theme is not the work of Jesus Himself then we know nothing about His words or His person. It is the peak of faith in the Old Testament, the supreme affirmation of the power of God and the weakness of man. When we meet the theme of the Suffering Servant as proclaimed in the New Testament, we are at the very center of the Christian revolution.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, page 98, 99. ‚ÄúThere has long been a tradition in Christianity which has cultivated a mystique of suffering for its own sake. Many Christian ascetics have sought fuller identification with Jesus as the Suffering Servant by the deliberate refusal of pleasure and the deliberate infliction of pain on themselves. A morbid form of this asceticism keeps pleasure from others and inflicts pain on others. The number of venerable names associated with this tradition is alarming. The Flagellates and the Penitentes have been rejected by the Church. Mere cultivation of pain does not assure identity with Jesus the Suffering Son of Man. Mere animal pain does not save. Identity with Jesus suffering is first of all identity with Jesus loving; to put it in a single word.‚Äù The Power and the Wisdom, page 103. ‚ÄúAs a prayerbook the Book of Psalms has to be accepted with certain reservations; it may be a merely personal quirk, but Psalm 119 says nothing which I wish to say to God on those occasions when I am impelled speak to him. There are a few other Psalms which I have never been able to use as prayers with any sincerity. Others might say that Psalm 109 sticks in their throat; if you wonder why, I suggest that you read it. The same could be said for Psalm 137‚Äù Source, p. 186\\\\. ‚ÄúWe cannot leave our discussion of the Psalms without referring to that one feature of them which is perhaps the greatest stumbling block to the modern reader: Imprecations, such as those we read in Psalms 68 (69) and 108 (109), and the appalling simplicity of Psalm 136 (137): ‚ÄúHappy the man who shall seize your little ones and dash them against the rock.‚Äù However the Hebrews may have felt about their Babylonian conquerors, we are not edified by a prayer that another conqueror may dash out the brains of Babylonian infants. Many are the expressions of dissatisfaction with such utterances, and many the attempts to rationalize them...Now Christians, like unbelievers, rarely turn the other cheek; when evil threatens their lives, their country, their goods the defend themselves with violence, as they feel morally free to do; they believe that they may, within the limits of Christian charity, desire that others suffer evil and inflict evil themselves upon others. We Christian are not, perhaps, so spiritually advanced beyond the ancient Hebrews as we sometimes like to think.‚Äù The Two-Edged Sword, pages 283-284. ‚ÄúPope and Bishops must proclaim the entire reality of Jesus Christ. The must proclaim that Western men and women will escape the ultimate horror only by attending to the person and words of Jesus. Like Paul, that is all they have to say; so let us say it.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, page 242. ‚ÄúWe Christians believe that Jesus is God's last word. What he is represented as saying makes it totally impossible to incorporate the genocide of the holy war into a Christian life.‚Äù Source p. 167, 168. ‚ÄúThe teachings of Jesus, as reported in the Gospels, is simple and without subtlety; it is addressed to the mental age of 12 years (as I'm told most television programs are addressed). The moral instructions of Jesus, as I have said before, are not hard to understand; they are just hard to do. We have devoted our intellectual subtlety to evading the words of Jesus, or to convincing ourselves that doing something else is just as good and a lot more practical.‚Äù Source, p. 176\\\\. ‚ÄúThink like Christ: What will that do to our world of values which we have built up by habit and conviction in our years from childhood, which we have learned from our parents and teachers, from our peers, from our friends and enemies‚Äîwith whom we share many values‚Äîfrom our reading, from the stage and screen, and now from the omnipresent television? Think like Christ‚Äîand how much of what we adore would we have to burn?‚Äù Source, p. 179, 180. ‚ÄúBoth the Gospels and Epistles insist that thinking like Jesus is a personal responsibility which each must fulfill for himself or herself. Source p. 181. \\"No one is so lacking in talent or education or so underprivileged that the mind of Christ is beyond their grasp.‚Äù Source, p. 184\\\\. ‚ÄúIf we know anything at all about the words of Jesus, we know that he was not indifferent to human pain. Fear of compromising his divinity has often kept Christians from seeing how deeply human pain entered into his soul. Jesus never said that suffering is not real, or that it does not hurt much, or that it passes quickly, or that it is good for you. He seems to have recommended something too simple, which does not touch the theoretical problem of suffering. His response to suffering was: stop hurting each other. That much anyone can do; if you cannot do that much, do not form a study group.‚Äù Source, p. 60\\\\. ‚ÄúIt has long seemed strange to me that Jesus should have been regarded as a mystic, an idealist, a dreamer, when these qualities could have been much more properly applied to many of his contemporaries; Jesus was a practical person in the sense that he proposed a program which anyone could follow.‚Äù Source, p. 110 ‚ÄúToo often in the modern world we take refuge behind such excuses as 'everybody does it.' Was it ever different in any society? My friend Gordon Zahn in recent years wrote about a German peasant named Franz Jagerstatter who refused the advice of his bishop, his priest, his neighbors and his family. He stubbornly resisted going along with National Socialism, although ‚Äúeverybody was doing it,‚Äù and he maintained this position in spite of no more than elementary education and apparently much less native intelligence than many who apparently served National Socialism with a good conscience, or at least a quiet conscience. Of course it cost him his life; he was beheaded. He died having saved something which those who survived had lost; they better than anyone else can tell what that is. I do not know whether Jagerstatter always thought like Christ; he succeeded in doing so at the most critical moment of his life‚Äîa little lonely man without power and prestige who showed that anyone can think like Christ.‚Äù Source, p, 182. ‚ÄúI write as a citizen of a nation which has shown no repentance of the horrors it has done, from the genocide of the American Indians to the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the savaging of Vietnam. I wrote above of the ‚Äúmicro separation‚Äù of church and state. But at the moment this is not my concern; my concern is with putting on the mind of Christ so that I can make Christian moral decisions in my state of life, my profession, my complex of human relations which is uniquely mine.‚Äù Source, p. 182,183. ‚ÄúI do know that Jesus has shown what one individual, no matter how small and insignificant he or she may be, can do to overcome evil where he or she meets it. I know that he has shown that complete human fulfillment is altogether independent of all the things which we associate with the good life.‚Äù Source p. 61, 62. ‚ÄúNot every expression of liturgical piety is to everyone's taste, nor has it ever been; but the Christian who thinks he or she does not need the concrete existing church in order to pray, or that he or she does it better alone, has some things to learn about who Jesus Christ is, what the church is, and who he or she is. We have to bear one another and forgive one another even when we pray together.‚Äù Source, p. 190, 191 ‚ÄúChristians know what Jesus meant when he said that if you cherish a grudge, do not even attempt to pray until it is settled (Matthew 5:23 -24).‚Äù Source, p. 191\\\\. ‚ÄúI believe that all that I know or think I know about God is derived from what Jesus was, said and did. I believe that the little we have left of what he said and did tells us more about how we can now in our world realize the possibilities of human existence than all the wisdom of the past and present‚Äîthat is he tells us something about how to live that no one else has ever told us. I apply to him what the late Vince Lombardi said about winning: Jesus is not an important person, he is the only person. I believe that he is now truly alive, as no one who ever lived and died is truly alive.‚Äù The Civilization of Christianity, page 17.

Set in Beiping (Beijing) when it was controlled by the Japanese, the novel describes the years of the Second Sino-Japanese War before the American entrance in 1941. It is a sequel to Lin's Moment in Peking. A Leaf in the Storm, a Novel of War-Swept China (New York: John Day, 1941) Plot The scene opens in Peking (Beiping) in 1937, on the eve of the war with Japan, when there was fierce debate over China's best strategy. Yao Poya, a wealthy but patriotic businessman, and Lao Peng, who is a Chan Buddhist but angry and actively supporting the guerrilla resistance, are sharing a dinner and chouyin \\"drinking in sorrow.\\" They mourn his retreats and military blunders, but Chiang Kai-shek is their hero. They resign themselves to his strategy of wearing down the Japanese Army and forcing them to brutalize and alienate the Chinese people. [5, 13] In spite of the fact that he is married, Poya is smitten with Malin, a young lady of shadowy background who has been forced to leave Shanghai when she was suspected of being a Japanese collaborator. Lao Peng uses his guerrilla connections to convey her out of Beiping. They watch a political training class for boy and girl students who were \\"starting life anew as if human civilization had not existed before ‚Äì except for their flashlights and fountain pens... It was freedom of the human spirit they were seeking, and they found it.\\" Their instructor, Comrade Peng, works with the Communist Eighth Route Army. Malin and Lao Peng proceed to Wuhan, where the wartime government has set up a temporary capital, and witness Japanese atrocities and heroic Chinese resistance. Lin gives bravado set pieces of the \\"greatest migration of people in all history,\\" [215] and hot, invective against Japanese barbarism: : Men had killed in battles since civilization began... but not until now, when God created man, had human eyes seen laughing soldiers throw a baby into the air and catch it expertly on the point of a sharp bayonet as it fell and call it sport... These things are not possible with normal men.... Not possible with gorillas. [215] Lao Peng, now aided by Malin, provides food and refuge for the homeless, sick, and abandoned: :So this group of scarred souls war thrown together by the accidents of war... some sick in body and some sick in soul. It was the need of food that brought this strange group together, and there were no other ties than certain common human decencies that enabled each to get along with the others. [236] Reception The book was chosen as one of the \\"outstanding books on the Far East published in 1941\\" by the Far Eastern Quarterly. In 1980, the literary critic and translator David Hawkes said of Leaf in the Storm that it is \\"by no means a bad novel,\\" but it \\"seems to me inferior to Fortress Besieged [by Qian Zhongshu]--not only because it has not the same hard intelligence, but also because in Leaf in the Storm Lin Yutang's much vaunted-humour seems for once to have deserted him.\\" Parts of the novel, Hawkes continued, \\"reread today like wartime propaganda,\\" a shortcoming Hawkes attributed to the fact that it \\"owes much of its background to the newspapers, which are strong on major horrors but have little to say about the boredom and innumerable petty privations which make up the everyday reality of war.\\" The publisher sold the rights for translation into Hebrew for ¬£10.

There has been a variety of discussion about the differing genre terms, with several critics describing the music under the broad category of \\"alternative R&B;\\" or \\"indie R&B;\\". The term \\"hipster R&B;\\" has been commonly used, as has the term \\"PBR&B;\\"‚Äîa combination of \\"PBR\\" (the abbreviation for Pabst Blue Ribbon, a beer most recently associated with the hipster subculture) and R&B.; The first use of \\"PBR&B;\\" was on Twitter by Sound of the City writer Eric Harvey on a March 22, 2011, post. Three years later, amazed and distressed at how far the term‚Äîmeant as a joke‚Äîhad traveled, Harvey wrote an extensive essay about it for Pitchfork. Slate suggests the name \\"R-Neg-B\\", as a reference to \\"negging\\". The genre has sometimes been called \\"noir&B;\\". However, the terms are often criticized for \\"pigeonholing\\" artists into hipster subculture and being used in a derisive manner. Characteristics Alternative R&B; artist Frank Ocean performing at the Coachella Festival in 2012 Barry Walters of Spin characterizes the unconventional style as an \\"exchange between EDM, rock, hip hop and R&B;'s commercial avant-garde\\", and cites Frank Ocean's Nostalgia, Ultra and Channel Orange, The Weeknd's House of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silence, Drake's Take Care, Miguel's Kaleidoscope Dream, Holy Other's Held and How to Dress Well's Total Loss as works associated with alternative R&B.; AllMusic's Andy Kellman cites the early albums of Bilal ‚Äì 1st Born Second and Love for Sale ‚Äì as antecedents to the \\"left-field R&B;\\" that developed in the late 2000s. According to Jim Farber of the NY Daily News, the Soulquarians collective of the late 1990s and early 2000s, which Bilal was a part of, \\"corral[ed] leaders of the alternative R&B; movement like the Roots and D'Angelo\\". Brandon Neasman of The Grio observes a \\"changing of the guard in R&B;, from the smooth, cool heartthrobs to these vulnerable, off-kilter personalities\\" amid the prevalence of social media in society. Neasman finds the subject matter of \\"these new-wave artists\\" to be more \\"relatable\\" and writes of alternative R&B;'s characteristics: Hermione Hoby of The Guardian writes that \\"the music is quietly radical\\" and observes \\"an ongoing, mutually enriching dialogue between indie and electronic musicians and R&B; artists.\\" Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times feels that \\"the new movement feels like the most significant stylistic change in R&B; since neo soul rolled around in the 1990s.\\" Janet Jackson's sixth studio album The Velvet Rope (1997) is cited as one of the genre's stylistic origins. Response There are two predominating opinions regarding alternative R&B; as a classifier of sonic and lyrical characteristics within the larger R&B; genre, the first of the two being a reluctant acceptance of its existence ‚Äì if only for the sake of marketability. Stereogum described the genre as a group of \\"co- conspirators, not a unified movement.\\" Similarly in thought, How to Dress Well, while not offended by the term \\"PBR&B;\\", finds it \\"tacky\\"; in an interview with Complex he points out that \\"if you put records [released by other alternative R&B; artists] side-by-side, me and whoever, like you're just not going to [hear] the same sounds, period\\", before proceeding to cite Miguel as an example. Miguel himself has said that he is \\"comfortable\\" with the term \\"indie R&B;\\" because it \\"insinuates a higher art. Or a deeper or somehow more artistic delivery of rhythm and blues music. It suggest there's more artistry within a genre that has become more of a clich√© of itself.\\" Frank Ocean, when first asked in an interview with The Quietus, whether he considers \\"Novacane\\" to be an R&B; song, responded, \\"You're limiting it. And that's why I always say that about the genre thing, because that's what it does. When you say 'it's that', you listen to it in a certain way. And you might not necessarily miss it, but it's just inaccurate, and you'll miss a couple of things, contextually.\\" He proceeds to point out that race and vocal delivery are stereotypical signifiers of R&B; music, in turn forcing himself and his peers into a category they may not identify within; when considering Nostalgia, Ultra Ocean argues that if he were a different complexion and \\"people would listen to it and be like 'Yeah, he borrowed from R&B; but it's just not R&B; ‚Äì it's a lot of things, and you can't just call it 'R&B.;'\\" In an interview with The Guardian, FKA Twigs rejected the term by declaring, \\"Fuck alternative R&B;!\\" She further explained: \\"It's just because I'm mixed race. When I first released music and no one knew what I looked like, I would read comments like: 'I've never heard anything like this before, it's not in a genre.' And then my picture came out six months later, now she's an R&B; singer.'\\" The Fader echoes her sentiment, stating, \\"By adding the prefix, it sidelines R&B; itself by implying it's not experimental, boundary-pushing or intellectual. It throws side-eye at the genre, while at the same time claiming to have discovered something worthy within it.\\" See also * List of alternative R&B; artists * Alternative hip hop * Neo soul References  Further reading  African-American music Contemporary R&B; genres Microgenres ","title":"Alternative R&amp;B"},{"id":"34212085","text":"Peter de Wit (born March 10, 1958 in Beverwijk) is a Dutch comics artist and cartoonist.

Users of lawyer-supported mediation first meet their respective lawyers to take advice before jointly attending mediation sessions. Legal advice is taken between sessions to inform options being discussed at mediation. Following mediation, the lawyers are called upon to review any agreement reached and to make aspects of it made legally binding. Since neither lawyer is initially being retained as a negotiator or litigator, the cost of legal advice is typically fixed for clients choosing lawyer-supported mediation. In the event of lawyer-supported mediation failing to deliver a partial or full agreement, both parties are free to retain their respective lawyers to pursue litigation. This is not the case with collaborative law where a breakdown in roundtable negotiations requires each party to instruct a new family lawyer before proceeding with court action.  United Kingdom  Lawyer-supported mediation is being pioneered in the United Kingdom (UK). A pilot service covering Greater London began in 2012. More recently, UK retail giant the Co-op launched a fixed fee legal advice service for clients choosing family mediation.

He first came to attention as an underground cartoonist in the early 1970s for the sexually explicit comics series Ans en Hans krijgen de kans (Ans and Hans Get the Chance). He is best known for co-creating Sjef van Oekel, a long- running comic strip based on the TV character, written by Wim T. Schippers. He received the 1989 Stripschapprijs for his body of work.  Biography   Early life  Theo van den Boogaard was born in 1948 in Castricum, in the Netherlands province of North Holland. As a child, he was interested in drawing and singing. At the age of 15, he published his first comic Mark, Boter bij de Vis (Mark, Butter with the Fish) At the age of 17, he began drawing for Hitweek magazine and moved to Amsterdam after graduation to begin his career. Amsterdam would later have great influence on his work, with the city being known for its \\"free-spirited\\" feel and openness to sexuality and culture.  Career  In 1967 he made the underground comix series Witje and Gertje for Hitweek, which was continued from 1968 to 1969 in Aloha. This work has been recognized as the first Dutch underground comic, but it faced criticism due to featuring a naked woman. For Studio, he drew the Pinocchio strip (1968). In 1969 he started in Aloha (and soon after in Chick) the series Ans en Hans krijgen de kans (Ans and Hans Get the Chance), which was noteworthy for its liberal treatment of sexuality, and gave him recognition by Andreas Knigger, a comics critic who described Boogaard as \\"the greatest European underground comics artist\\". The comic was published in 1972 as an album by De Bezige Bij. For Voetbal International he drew the comic Abe, een hotshot van een voetballerina (Abe, a Hotshot of a Footballer) (1972), written by journalist Nico Scheepmaker. Beginning in 1976, van den Boogaard drew Sjef van Oekel, a comic about the experiences of the well-known and controversial television character. The series was popular, and Dolf Brouwers, who played the character on TV, came to object to the fact that he received no compensation for his likeness being used, and for the sexual content of the series, and in 1989 he sued. In 1991 a judge ruled the character should not be portrayed in \\"obscene or pornographic scenes\\". Schippers and Bouwers eventually settled on the financial compensation. Van den Boogaard made the album Joost mag het weten (Joost May Know), a collection with short humorous erotically-tinted stories about homosexuality, bestiality, and pedophilia. Between 1980 and 1984, Boogaard was published in the American comics series Gay Comix. He drew an untitled comic in issue #1, \\"My Most Embarrassing Childhood Experience\\" in issue #3, and the back cover of issue #5. In 2003, he published Theo van den Boogaard signs death. In 2005 he created Iron Lines, followed by The art of following, about receiving guidance. In 2013, he began to focus on his childhood dream of singing and drawing, and created a Bob Dylan piece that he plays on a screen while he performs Bob Dylan hits on stage. In 2016, he published Four Winters In a Row, a set of illustrations paired with a song of his, about a man struggling to find happiness.  Personal life  Van den Boogaard is openly gay, and has incorporated related themes into his work. As of 2016, he has undergone chemotherapy treatment, but the type of cancer has not been disclosed. He has spoken of his struggles to keep drawing while undergoing chemotherapy, and discussed his fight for happiness in his Four Winters In a Row.

He was heavily criticized for rejecting the participation of Franciscan missions in the territory, for impeding the conversion of indigenous people to Christianity, and for exploiting the labor of these people.  Biography  Although the time and place of his birth are unknown, it is believed that he was born in Seville, Spain. He was appointed governor of Spain's New Mexico colony and installed in that office in late November 1634, succeeding Francisco de la Mora y Ceballos. His main activity as governor was to exploit the labor of the Hispanic settlers and, especially, that of the native population. Once in power, he organized a series of commercial companies, paying little attention to his duties as governor in the province, such as that of maintaining peace between settlers and Native Americans. Mart√≠nez de Baeza forced the Amerindians to gather pine nuts and trade in manufactured goodsJohn, Elizabeth Ann Harper (Second edition, 1996).

(specifically in furs, fabrics, and cotton blankets), which were produced by Puebloans and other Native American peoples in his workshops in Santa Fe. His demands were so burdensome that some people were forced to negotiate with other pueblos to get the cotton needed in order to manufacture the fabrics required. Workers were paid a very low wage. The Native Americans had to work every day, including Church holidays. By late 1636 the governor had produced enough to send nine wagonloads of goods south in search of trading opportunities.The official history of New Mexico: Francisco Mart√≠nez de Baeza. Published by Rick Hendricks. Retrieved 29 December 2011, to 1:14 pm. Mart√≠nez de Baeza took little interest in the Franciscan missions, making it difficult for them to convert indigenous people to Christianity. Nor did he pay attention to Native American attacks against settlers and their descendants, and as a result he was denounceds by the Franciscans. On 24 September 1636, the Franciscan custodian, Fray Crist√≥bal de Quir√≥s, explained to Mart√≠nez de Baeza his decision to establish a mission in Zuni Pueblo and requested military escorts for the missionaries. However, Mart√≠nez de Baeza rejected the demand, under the pretext that Quir√≥s should request it in a more respectful manner. The Franciscan explained that the necessary encomiendas and allotments of tribute from the Puebloan Indian hads already been established to pay for the escorts. However, the Governor asked Father Quir√≥s for proof of his assertions, knowing that the Franciscans themselves had decided that conversion to Christianity should to be done in the apostolic way, by persuasion, and never by means of military force. Therefore, in November 1636, both Crist√≥bal de Quir√≥s and Fray Antonio de Ibargaray sent a packet of letters of protest against Mart√≠nez de Baeza to the viceroy, Lope D√≠ez de Armend√°riz, in Mexico City. Meanwhile, Mart√≠nez de Baeza wrote a series of reports containing false information about certain individuals of the clergy in order to discredit them in the eyes of the viceroy. His governorship ended on 18 April 1637, leaving the colony in hands of Luis de Rosas.  Last years  In Mexico City, on 11 December 1639, Mart√≠nez de Baeza signed his last will and testament, leaving a bequest of fifty pesos to the \\"Cofrad√≠a del Sant√≠simo Sacramento\\" (Brotherhood of the Holy Sacrament) of the parish of San Marcos in Seville, and other money to cover any debts that he apparently had with Sevillian merchants.

He is remembered for promoting the geometric algebra of Hermann Grassmann and for a method of visualizing polytopes called Schlegel diagrams. In the nineteenth century there were various expansions of the traditional field of geometry through the innovations of hyperbolic geometry, non-Euclidean geometry and algebraic geometry. Hermann Grassmann was one of the more advanced innovators with his anticipation of linear algebra and multilinear algebra that he called \\"Extension theory\\" (Ausdehnungslehre). As recounted by David E. Rowe in 2010: :The most important new convert was Victor Schlegel, Grassmann‚Äôs colleague at Stettin Gymnasium from 1866 to 1868. Afterward Schlegel accepted a position as Oberlehrer at the Gymnasium in Waren, a small town in Mecklenburg. In 1872 Schlegel published the first part of his System der Raumlehre which used Grassmann‚Äôs methods to develop plane geometry. Schlegel used his book to put forth Grassmann‚Äôs case, arguing that \\"Grassmann‚Äôs ideas had been neglected because he had not held a university chair.\\" Continuing his criticism of academics, Schlegel expressed the reactionary view that :Rather than developing a sound basis for their analytic methods, contemporary mathematicians tended to invent new symbolisms on an ad hoc basis, creating a Babel-like cacophony of unintelligible languages. Schlegel‚Äôs attitude was that no basis for scientific method was shown in mathematics, and \\"neglect of foundations had led to the widely acknowledged lack of interest in mathematics in the schools.\\" The mathematician Felix Klein addressed Schlegel‚Äôs book in a reviewJahrbuch √ºber die Fortschritte der Mathematik Jahrgang 1872, SS. 231‚Äì5 criticizing him for neglect of cross ratio and failure to contextualize Grassmann in the flow of mathematical developments. Rowe indicates that Klein was most interested in developing his Erlangen program. In 1875 Schlegel countered with the second part of his System der Raumlehre, answering Klein in the preface. This part developed conic sections, harmonic ranges, projective geometry, and determinants. Schlegel published a biography of Hermann Grassmann in 1878. Both parts of his textbook, and the biography, are now available at the Internet Archive; see External links section below. At the Summer meeting of the American Mathematical Society on August 15, 1894, Schlegel presented an essay on the problem of finding the place which is at a minimum total distance from given points. In 1899 Schlegel became German national secretary for the international Quaternion Society and reported on it in Monatshefte f√ºr Mathematik.

It follows protagonist Myfanwy Thomas as she attempts to re-integrate into her life of administrating a clandestine government organization responsible for protecting the U.K. from supernatural threats. Following a magically-induced bout of amnesia, she works to uncover the identity of a traitor inside the organization while simultaneously keeping her amnesia a secret. The title of the book is a reference to Thomas' rank in her organization, the Checquy. The sequel Stiletto was simultaneously released in the United States and United Kingdom on 14 June 2016 through Little, Brown and Company. Plot The book follows a young woman in her thirties who wakes up in a park surrounded by bodies wearing latex gloves. She's unable to remember anything about herself or how she or the bodies got there, and her only clue is a letter in her coat pocket that says, \\"To You\\". Inside is a letter that tells her the body previously belonged to Myfanwy (rhymes with Tiffany) Thomas, who worked in a secret government organization and was targeted by an unknown assassin. The letter offers the young woman (who is thereafter identified in the book as Myfanwy, although she sees herself as a separate person, considering her 'original' self as Thomas) a choice of taking up the life of the woman before her and discovering the identity of the would-be killer, or setting out with a new identity. Although she initially chooses to take up a new identity, Myfanwy eventually chooses to take up the first Myfanwy's life and discover who wants her dead. She is left with a binder that outlines the organization known as the Checquy (\\"sheck-ay\\") which combats the supernatural and unnatural forces that threaten Great Britain. Many of the members possess supernatural powers; only the ones with such powers are allowed to hold any true positions of power. Myfanwy finds that her specific power is control over other people's bodies through touch, which her predecessor never truly fully explored. The first Myfanwy was a Rook, a lower member of the inner court of the Checquy, which allowed her to do a lot of research into the workings of the organization. Myfanwy uses the binder heavily throughout the book, especially when it comes to trying to figure out which people she can or cannot trust. She quickly discovers that while the first Myfanwy was exceedingly skilled at organization and management, she was very timid and shy when it came to interpersonal relationships. This is partially a result of how she was inducted into the Checquy as a nine-year-old girl, as she was interrogated quite thoroughly in a manner that was not shown to the reader. The new Myfanwy does show skill at her job and finds she's able to do far more with her powers than her predecessor was, implied to be the result of Thomas' developing psychological blocks on her powers based on the traumatic experiences that activated them and her treatment in the aftermath which Myfanwy has not 'inherited'. This makes her stand out more with the other members of the Checquy, especially when Myfanwy uses them to dispatch a large patch of semi- sentient mold and a large cube of carnivorous flesh. She also discovers that many recent troubles are due to a group known as the Grafters, a group of Belgians who were seemingly destroyed in the 1600s after failing to conquer the Isle of Wight. The group was seen as monstrous due to its deep and thorough knowledge of genetic and surgical modification. They were considered a dire threat by the Checquy. An organizational chart of The Rook's Checquy Group. Myfanwy soon finds that her fellow Rook, Rook Gestalt (one mind with four bodies, one of which is female), is working for the Grafters. While Gestalt isn't the one who had tried to kill her, it (as the first Myfanwy refers to Gestalt) views her with great disdain. She publicly accuses it of treason at a Checquy event, which ends in many of the Retainers, the non- supernatural members of the Checquy, turning on the powered members. Two of the Gestalt bodies are captured, with two escaping. This exacerbates Myfanwy's fears for herself, as well as for her sister Bronwyn, who managed to track Myfanwy down with the intent to rediscover her lost sibling, unaware of Myfanwy's true identity as a supernatural operative. Myfanwy initially suspects Bishop Aldrich, a vampire, is the culprit, but eventually discovers that it is actually Bishop Grantchester, the man whom the first Myfanwy had replaced as Rook after he was promoted. Grantchester attempts to have Myfanwy's mind wiped again, but she fights back and successfully kills two of Gestalt's bodies in the process. Grantchester gets away, however the remaining Grafter threats are killed, and the remaining Gestalt bodies are either taken captive or killed. The book ends with Myfanwy's discovering one of the founders of the Grafter group in her office, wanting to discuss a potential merger of his group with the Checquy. Despite her fears over what potential threats this may bring and belief that the Grafters are still a potential threat, Myfanwy agrees to create a meeting with the remaining members of the inner court. She has decided to remain with the court but decides against telling anyone else about her memory loss.

The weirdest thing was that when all four pairs of eyes opened, only one mind was looking out from behind them. This was Gestalt. Gestalt is kind of disconcerting, because it/he/she/they is/are spread over four bodies. People try to avoid calling Gestalt anything but Gestalt because they get confused about the grammar.

Responses have mainly come from Hoppe's colleagues at the Mises Institute, among whom the argument's reception has been mixed. Argumentation ethics aims to prove that arguing against the right-wing interpretation of self-ownership is not logically coherent. Hoppe states that if argumentation praxeologically presupposes the norm that both the speaker and the listener are allowed to exercise exclusive control over their respective physical bodies in order to settle a disagreement or resolve a conflict over scarce resources, then it follows that propositions propounded during such argumentation cannot contradict this norm without falling into a (dialectical) performative contradiction between one's actions and words. Thus Hoppe concludes that despite violations against self-ownership and private property being possible, it can not be argumentatively justified. While argumentative ethics is actually a meta-ethics, Hoppe did not define the term. Foundation Hoppe states that his theory is an a priori, value-free praxeological argument for libertarian ethics. Argumentation ethics asserts the recognition of self-ownership is a presupposition of every argument and so cannot be logically denied during an argument. Argumentation ethics draws on ideas from J√ºrgen Habermas's and Karl-Otto Apel's discourse ethics, from Misesian praxeology and from the political philosophy of Murray Rothbard. Hoppe first notes that when two parties are in conflict with one another they can, eventually, choose to resolve the conflict by one of two means. Engaging in violence, or engaging in honest argumentation. In the event that they choose argumentation, Hoppe asserts that the parties must have implicitly rejected violence as a way to resolve their conflict. That is, both participants agree that each one has to exercise exclusive control over their body parts in order to produce and perceive meaningful sentences. He therefore concludes that non-violence is one of the underlying norms (Grundnorm) of meaningful argumentation that is accepted by both participants. Hoppe states that since both parties act to propound propositions in the course of such argumentation, and because argumentation must presuppose certain norms (that he specifies, non-violence among them), then the content of the propositions cannot negate the presupposed propositions of argumentation. To do so is a performative contradiction between one's actions and one's words. Deriving the private property ethic from the presuppositions of argumentation Argumentation ethics aims to show the private property ethic (in a certain formulation) follows from the presuppositions of argumentation, and so it cannot be denied. Other than dismissing propositions calling for violence as means to resolve conflict, Hoppe also argues that only universal norms are consistent with such meaningful argumentation, as, he claims, arbitrary categorical distinctions have no intersubjective justification, which also must be a presupposition of such argumentation. Hoppe then also argues that since argumentation requires the active use of one's body, all universal norms for resolving conflicts over the human body aside from self-ownership are inconsistent with argumentation, as they would not allow one to independently move. Hoppe then argues that since the resolution of conflicts over external resources must also be objectively justifiable, only the physical establishment of an objective link by original appropriation (i.e., homesteading) is a norm compatible with such a requirement. From these Hoppe concludes that only the private property ethic can be justified in an argument without contradiction.The Ultimate Justification of the Private Property Ethic. Hans Hoppe Punishment and self-defense Bearing reference to the legal doctrine of estoppel, Stephan Kinsella's \\"Dialogical Estoppel\\" theory extends argumentation ethics by considering an argument between a victim and aggressor. Kinsella argues that an aggressor cannot consistently object to being proportionally punished for his act of aggression, by the victim or by the victim's representatives, because by committing aggression he commits himself to the proposition that the use of force is legitimate, and therefore, his withholding consent based on a normative right not to be physically harmed contradicts his aggressive legitimation of force, i.e. he is \\"estopped\\" from withholding consent.Punishment and Proportionality: The Estoppel Approach. N.S. Kinsella Responses from scholars Various responses to Hoppe's argument came from Mises Institute scholars. Some of them accepted his argument, among them attorney Kinsella and economists Walter Block and Murray Rothbard, who called it \\"a dazzling breakthrough for political philosophy in general and for libertarianism in particular,\\" adding \\"he has managed to transcend the famous is/ought, fact/value dichotomy that has plagued philosophy since the days of the Scholastics...\\" Mises Institute economists Bob Murphy and Gene Callahan rejected Hoppe's argument. The late Austrian Economist David Osterfeld, an adjunct scholar at the Mises Institute, also rejected Hoppe's argument in an essay to which Hoppe subsequently responded. Walter Block has since defended the argument and Marian Eabrasu rebuts a wide range of criticisms. Ludwig Von Mises Institute Senior Fellow and Auburn University philosopher Roderick Long reconstructed the argument in deductively valid form, specifying four premises on whose truth the argument's soundness depends. Long goes on to argue that each premise is either uncertain, doubtful, or clearly false. He summarizes his views by stating: A political theorist has concluded in a doctoral dissertation on the political philosophy of several Austrian economists that Hoppe has not provided any non-circular reasons why we \\"have to regard moral values as something that must be regarded as being established through (consensual) argument instead of 'mere' subjective preferences for situations turning out in certain ways\\". In other words, the theory relies on \\"the existence [of] certain intuitions, the acceptance of which cannot itself be the result of 'value-free' reasoning.\\"J.

The CPM features its own RISC microcontroller (Communication Processor), separate from the actual Central Processing Unit IP core. The RISC microcontroller communicates with the core using dual-ported RAM, special command, configuration and event registers as well as via interrupts.

Seven of the plane‚Äôs eight occupants were found within 50 feet of the wreckage; the remaining passenger was found still in the cabin. All of the victims showed signs of massive impact trauma, and were believed to have been killed instantly. The weather in the area had been reported as clear, except for in the vicinity of the river, where heavy ground fog was present. Preliminary reports believed the ground fog to have been a factor. Upon examination of the wreckage, it was found that the plane had, for unknown reasons, been in a low turn near the ground, and the wingtip made contact with the terrain, causing the aircraft to impact the ground. The reason for the low-altitude turn was unknown. ‚ÄúA preliminary investigation by A. S. Koch, Federal aeronautical inspector, indicated the crash was caused by fog. Major R. W.

Analogously the notion of a left Kasch ring is defined, and the two properties are independent of each other. Kasch rings are named in honor of mathematician Friedrich Kasch. Kasch originally called Artinian rings whose proper ideals have nonzero annihilators S-rings. The characterizations below show that Kasch rings generalize S-rings. Definition Equivalent definitions will be introduced only for the right- hand version, with the understanding that the left-hand analogues are also true. The Kasch conditions have a few equivalent statements using the concept of annihilators, and this article uses the same notation appearing in the annihilator article. In addition to the definition given in the introduction, the following properties are equivalent definitions for a ring R to be right Kasch. They appear in : # For every simple right R module S, there is a nonzero module homomorphism from M into R. # The maximal right ideals of R are right annihilators of ring elements, that is, each one is of the form \\\\mathrm{r.ann}(x)\\\\, where x is in R. # For any maximal right ideal T of R, \\\\mathrm{\\\\ell.ann}(T) eq\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}. # For any proper right ideal T of R, \\\\mathrm{\\\\ell.ann}(T) eq\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}. # For any maximal right ideal T of R, \\\\mathrm{r.ann}(\\\\mathrm{\\\\ell.ann}(T))=T. # R has no dense right ideals except R itself. Examples The content below can be found in references such as , , . *Let R be a semiprimary ring with Jacobson radical J. If R is commutative, or if R/J is a simple ring, then R is right (and left) Kasch. In particular, commutative Artinian rings are right and left Kasch. * For a division ring k, consider a certain subring R of the four-by-four matrix ring with entries from k. The subring R consists of matrices of the following form: :: \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & 0 & b & c \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & a & 0 & d \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & a & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & e \\\\end{bmatrix} :This is a right and left Artinian ring which is right Kasch, but not left Kasch. * Let S be the ring of power series on two noncommuting variables X and Y with coefficients from a field F. Let the ideal A be the ideal generated by the two elements YX and Y2. The quotient ring S/A is a local ring which is right Kasch but not left Kasch. * Suppose R is a ring direct product of infinitely many nonzero rings labeled Ak. The direct sum of the Ak forms a proper ideal of R. It is easily checked that the left and right annihilators of this ideal are zero, and so R is not right or left Kasch. * The two-by-two upper (or lower) triangular matrix ring is not right or left Kasch. * A ring with right socle zero (i.e. \\\\mathrm{soc}(R_R)=\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}) cannot be right Kasch, since the ring contains no minimal right ideals. So, for example, domains which are not division rings are not right or left Kasch.

The video game series of interactive adventures was based on The Magic School Bus book series and public television series (which originally aired on PBS). Computer Most of the original software games were created by the software company Music Pen in collaboration with Microsoft and Scholastic Press, the publisher of the Magic School Bus book series. To access the home market, Microsoft created a video game brand called Microsoft Home, and a software series was created under that umbrella. Like the TV series, the bus was animated in the usual way, in the CD-ROM games, it is typically animated with computer generated imagery (or \\"CGI\\"). In all these titles the user gets to \\"drive\\" the bus, which almost always involves clicking on the steering wheel and choosing a location. (The exception is The Magic School Bus Explores Inside the Earth where it is the gear shift instead of the steering wheel.) Most of the games in the original software were based with the book series (the original series books) and TV series. Most of the games also have seven different locations, including the classroom. There is some goal to find a specific number of missing collectibles for the user in almost every game (with the exception of The Magic School Bus Explores the Human Body). In the other games, there is a \\"missing collectible\\" minigame where the player has to find three or four missing collectibles. The video game series (both original titles and activity centers) are targeted for children ages 5-10. System requirements vary among the games. Games with the Macintosh indication can be used on a Macintosh LC 550 or newer with a minimum of System 7.1, 8 MB RAM, 8 MB hard disk space, color monitor, and 2X CD-ROM drive. Original Software The Magic School Bus Explores the Solar System (1994) This game is based on both the book The Magic School Bus Lost in the Solar System (from the classic series books) and episode The Magic School Bus Gets Lost in Space. The user can fly the bus to any planet he or she chooses and play experiments and click on things there. To win the game, the user has to discover the whereabouts of Ms. Frizzle. To do so they have to play a \\"whatsit\\" game to earn a token (for a total of three missing tokens in order to find Ms. Frizzle) which gives them a clue as to which planet Ms. Frizzle is on. Once Ms. Frizzle is found, the bus will return to the classroom and the game begins again. All nine planets, plus the moon can be visited. When the gas giants are visited, the bus lands on one of their moons. The game was one of the chosen few \\"highly visual scholastic programs\\" in the Citrus Country library System's new youth CD-ROM station in 1997. The Spokesman-Review deemed it a \\"fact-and-fun filled ride\\". The Magic School Bus Explores the Human Body (1994, Macintosh) This game is based on the book The Magic School Bus Inside the Human Body and the episode The Magic School Bus for Lunch. Arnold has become the class' next field trip. The user can drive the bus to 12 different organs. In some locations, the player can leave the bus. Each place has an arcade game and a science experiment and a lot to explore. This is the first game that allows the user to sign in and go to the back of the bus. This is also one of the few games in which Liz can talk. This is the only game to not have a \\"missing collectible\\" minigame (where the player must find a specific and fixed number of missing collectibles). Both Quandary and All Game Guide gave the game 70/100. Superkids gave it 3.5/5 stars. The Milwaukee Sentinel was bemused that the program got a kindergartner playtester interested in the small intestines. Bangor Daily News deemed it a \\"splendid mix of experiments, explanations, and games\\". The Daily Gazette deemed it \\"delightful\\". The Boston Globe tested the problem on the latest Compaq Presario computer, yet experience game-breaking technical issues; the newspaper therefore commented that \\"Microsoft should be ashamed of itself\\". The Economist said the game was less informative than DK Multimedia titles. The game was the 6th most popular education titles in the education category sold in Software Etc. and Babbage's stores in the Washington area in the week ending September 27, 1997. The Magic School Bus Explores the Ocean (1995, Macintosh) This game is based on The Magic School Bus on the Ocean Floor and the episode The Magic School Bus Gets Eaten (including its TV tie in book adaptation). This is one of the two games which is based with any book from the TV tie in books, with the other being The Magic School Bus Explores Inside the Earth. The class has taken a field trip to the beach; here they find a message in a bottle, which contains clues (three clues) to a treasure. The user explores the ocean and follows clues that lead him/her to the treasure. This was the first CD-ROM that featured the entire cast on the bus and is the only game where the classroom can't be visited. A Nintendo DS version was released in 2011. The game won an award for Home PC - Holiday Gift Guide - The Best Programs of 1996. The Cedartown Standard praised the game for combining fun with education. The Magic School Bus Explores Inside the Earth (1996) This game is based on the book The Magic School Bus Inside the Earth and the episode The Magic School Bus Blows Its Top (and its TV tie in book adaptation). Arnold has lost some of the rocks and minerals in his collection. He is missing four rocks. The user (who has to find four missing rocks) explores several places such as a canyon, a geode, a fault, a volcano, and an undersea environment; the undersea environment features a subduction zone, a mid-ocean ridge, and an underwater volcano. The user can collect rocks in various ways. The goal is to find replacements for the rocks and minerals Arnold lost. Superkids gave the game a score of 4.3/5. Alamo PC Organization wrote that \\"the program is both educating and entertaining\\". The Magic School Bus Explores in the Age of Dinosaurs (1996) This game (in the original software series) is based on the book The Magic School Bus in the Time of the Dinosaurs and the episode The Magic School Bus The Busasaurus. This is the last game in the software which is based with any books from the book series. Ms. Frizzle's photo album is missing three snapshots of prehistoric animals (from a specific album; meat eating dinosaurs, plant eating dinosaurs, or prehistoric reptiles that aren't dinosaurs). The user travels back in time with her class, to seven different dinosaur locations, in order to search for live dinosaurs and help replace the photographs. When the player finds all three photographs, they are awarded with a mask of a prehistoric animal (matching to an animal from that specific album; either Tyrannosaurus rex, Brachiosaurus, or Pterodactylus). For saving the game, unique to just this game, if the player has too many driver's license panels saved up already, if they decide to quit and save the game, they can (before exiting) choose an old driver's license to replace/discard to make room for the new file. Both All Game Guide and Quandary gave it 70/100. Metzomagic gave it 3.5/5 stars. Microsoft donated copies of the game to high school students via the University of Maine Upward Bound Program. The Magic School Bus Explores the Rainforest (1997) The class is decorating their classroom for \\"Rainforest Day\\". Wanda brought a \\"Right-Away-Rainforest Toolbox\\" that could do the job, but some \\"bio-clones\\" (four of them) are missing from the kit. Ms. Frizzle takes the class on a field trip to the Costa Rican rainforest to find the missing bio-clones. This game is the first one in the original software to be not based with any books from the book series. However (like the other five previous games in the software), it is based with TV episodes from the cartoon series. This game is based with the TV episode The Magic School Bus In the Rainforest. But it is the last game to be based with any adaptation. This is also the last game to be created by Music Pen. All Game Guide gave it 80/100. The Magic School Bus Explores the World of Animals (1999) This is the first game in the software series to replace the original voice actors of the eight children from the TV series. This is the first of the two games in the original software which is not based with any adaptation (book series, TV series, and TV tie in books). In this game, the user has to find all four animals (which are placed into their wrong habitats) and send them back to their own (and correct) habitats where they each belong. If the game is played at another time, the player has two options (to \\"Continue saved game\\" or \\"Collect 4 missing collectibles\\"; the second option \\"Collect 4 missing collectibles\\" starts a new game if chosen and the save data from the previous use gets deleted). When traveling to certain habitats, one of the children will be transformed into an animal (for example, Arnold becomes a bullfrog in the swamp). This is the first of the two games in the software to be created by Know Wonder instead of Music Pen (since starting with this game, Microsoft stopped collaborating with Music Pen and started collaborating with Know Wonder). Superkids gave the game a score of 4.7/5. Bangor Daily News said the game \\"is jampacked with unusual animals, interesting information, games, puzzles, and experiments\\". The Magic School Bus Explores Bugs (2000) The children have designed biodomes for a contest, but each pair has lost one of the bugs from their projects. This is the final game in the original software series. Like in The Magic School Bus Explores the World of Animals, this game is not based with any adaptation. The player's task in this game is to find a specimen of each of the four missing bugs in one of four natural habitats. In each habitat, one of the children transforms into a bug; for example, Keesha changes into a luna moth when she is in the forest. The game was given a score of 90/100 by Tech with Kids (Computing with Kids) and 50/100 by Macworld. SuperKids gave it 4.5/5. Ludington Daily News praised the game for its high quality engaging multimedia and accurate information. Activity Centers Like the final two games from the Magic School Bus original software (The Magic School Bus Explores the World of Animals and The Magic School Bus Explores Bugs), Microsoft for the activity center software games collaborated with Know Wonder. =The Magic School Bus: In Concert Activity Center (2000)= This game was developed by KnowWonder and published by Microsoft.

Sega Genesis * Scholastic's The Magic School Bus: Space Exploration Game (1995) ** This was the only game created on a medium other (Sega Genesis) than PC CD-ROM. The premise was for the Magic School Bus to select a destination (starting with The Moon and reaching all the way out to Pluto). The game would then follow the same format; Ms. Frizzle would take off into outer space, and the player (sd Phoebe) would have to find her. All missions consisted of flying to the planet (while taking photographs of various space objects, shooting apart meteors, and collecting \\"space buoys\\" for fuel), landing the bus on a platform successfully, traversing the planet on foot to find Ms. Frizzle, and putting together a sliding jigsaw puzzle to complete the stage.

Its share capital amounted to 450,000 Swiss francs, half provided by the canton of Fribourg and the other half by the communities adjacent to Bulle. As a result of World War I, the company ran into financial difficulties, and on 1 April 1929 therefore ceded the management of the trolleybus line to the Chemins de fer √©lectriques de la Gruy√®re (CEG).

Hopkins was baptized in Yeovilton, county Somerset, England on 7 April 1616, the son of William Hopkins and Joane (Arnold) Hopkins. His mother was the sister of early Providence settler William Arnold and the daughter of Nicholas and Alice (Gully) Arnold of Northover and Ilchester in Somerset. Hopkins' mother died when he was five years old, after which he and his sister Frances were probably taken into the family of their Uncle William Arnold, and most writers on his early history agree that he sailed to New England at age 19 with his uncle's family in 1635. On the same ship was his first cousin Benedict Arnold, also aged 19, the future governor of the Rhode Island colony. The Arnolds first settled in Hingham in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, but they remained there less than a year. They joined Roger Williams in April 1636 and were among the first settlers of Providence Plantations. Soon after, they were the first English settlers on the Pawtuxet River, the southern edge of Williams's Providence purchase. Hopkins was not yet of age when they settled here, but when he reached his majority he was one of 39 signers of an agreement in 1640 to form a government in Providence, signing his name with a mark. From 1652 to 1672, Hopkins served in a number of civic positions in Providence, including Commissioner, Deputy, and member of the Town Council.

It is located at the western end of the Lincoln Road Mall at the intersection with Alton Road, and can house some 300 cars. Since its opening in 2010, it has attracted considerable interest because its unique appearance is different from more traditional parking garage designs. Background In 2005, local developer Robert Wennett bought a SunTrust Bank office structure that was from 1968 and the Brutalist style. This included an adjacent surface parking lot. Intent upon revitalizing the western end of Lincoln Road Mall, Wennett decided not to completely eliminate the existing structure, but instead build something next to it of equal height ‚Äì a parking garage. As Architectural Record has noted, \\"In the Pantheon of Building Types, the parking garage lurks somewhere in the vicinity of prisons and toll plazas.\\" The New York Times has labeled parking garages \\"the grim afterthought of American design\\". But Wennett was determined to do something different, and interviewed ten well-known architects around the globe before choosing Herzog & de Meuron. Construction began in 2008 and entailed closing the western end of Lincoln Road Mall. The resulting structure cost $65 million to build. The overall project included renovation of the existing building into one used for storefronts and offices for creative firms, and construction of a new, smaller structure for SunTrust that also contained a few apartments. Design and use The design, led by Herzog & de Meuron partner Christine Binswanger, has been characterized as resembling a house of cards. It is an open-air structure with no exterior walls constructed around buttresses and cantilevers that features floor heights varying from 8 to 34 feet. Some of the internal ramps are quite steep in order to accommodate the wider height intervals. Elevators and a central, winding staircase take drivers to and from their cars. A glassed-in high-fashion boutique, Alchemist, sits on an edge of the fifth floor. The parking garage features retail space at the street level, with tenants such as Taschen books, Osklen clothing, Nespresso coffee and MAC cosmetics and is joined to the other structures that were part of the project. Wennett built a penthouse apartment for himself as part of a space on the structure's roof that also features a pool and gardens with hanging vines. Jacques Herzog of the firm called the parking garage the most radical work they had ever done. A car descends between the third and second floors of the garage, as seen from the central staircase. Part of the red neon \\"1111\\" sign that faces Lincoln Road Mall can be seen as well. The garage has become a destination for architects and photographers interested in its design. It has achieved renown as a tourist attraction as well, especially after it was featured on the front page of The New York Times in January 2011. Several hundred people a day walk into the garage to look around. Runners use it for exercise. Those parking their cars often linger for the panoramic views it provides of the South Beach area, before going on their way (although acrophobics likely stay away from the edges). One loyal customer refuses to park anywhere else and was quoted as saying, \\"It's a work of art more than a garage. Everywhere you look, there's a view.\\" The seventh floor doubles as an event space. The garage has drawn requests for many types of events to be held there, including wine tastings, dinner parties, and yoga classes. It has been a site for weddings, and one woman had a drawing of the garage on her invitations. It has also been the scene of celebrity-filled parties, such as one Ferrari gave during Art Basel Miami Beach week (where two dozen of the maker's automobiles ran up and down the garage's ramps). At Art Basel 2011, German automaker BMW unveiled both its i3 and i8 electric prototype concept cars on the parking structure's seventh floor. A television commercial for the Lexus IS 250 was filmed there. Reception A glass-enclosed fashion boutique sits at the edge of the fifth floor of the garage. Since its opening, 1111 Lincoln Road has received varied reviews. The director of Miami Beach's Wolfsonian Museum said that the structure \\"sets a new bar for what parking garages could and should be.\\" Architectural Record wrote that the designers managed to successfully relate the structure to the nearby surroundings, but more importantly, \\"are helping break the mold for the lowly parking garage, lifting it up out of its gloomy limbo into the light and air.\\" The Los Angeles Times referred to it as \\"stunning\\", and the Associated Press wrote that it \\"has become a modern gateway to the see-and-be-seen cafe scene of Miami Beach's Lincoln Road.\\" Some users have objected to the high price for parking at 1111 Lincoln Road, which can be up to four times greater than at other lots in the area. (Conversely, drivers of luxury cars like parking at 1111 to emphasize their status.) Others have complained that the garage is not sufficiently protected against South Florida's rainstorms. University of Miami film professor Lisa Gottlieb said that appreciation for the garage reflected poorly on Miami Beach: \\"It says something about the aesthetic down here. I guess this is what we bring to the table ‚Äì a fancy parking garage.\\" The \\"starchitect\\" phenomenon was reaching the Miami area, with Frank Gehry's nearby New World Center following in 2011 and Herzog & de Meuron's new Miami Art Museum in the works as well. Given the success of the 1111 structure, owners of other new parking garages in South Beach have tried to add design elements to their properties. In 2012, the American Institute of Architects's Florida Chapter placed 1111 Lincoln Road on its list Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places.

Caroline Rosetta Small was born in India on 10 February 1829 to English parents, Beaumont Dixie Small and Caroline Honora Pereira. Her father, an assistant surgeon with the East India Company's Bengal Light Infantry, died unexpectedly in 1831. Caroline's mother later married James Frushard on 1 March 1834. With the exception of two years spent studying in Paris, Fraser spent most of her youth in India. On 11 March 1847, she married Alexander Fraser, at the time a lieutenant in the Bengal Engineer Group. Alexander Fraser went on to have a long career as a civil engineer building numerous railroads and lighthouses throughout India. The couple had two sons, Alexander Bruce Siddons Fraser (1848‚Äì1933) and Campbell Edward Fraser (1850‚Äì1926), both born in India. Fraser's writing career appears to have coincided with the breakdown of her marriage. By the 1871 British Census, Fraser was living alone with her widowed mother and sons in England. English civil records indicate that Fraser applied unsuccessfully for a legal separation in 1867 and again in 1885. General Fraser returned to England, living independently with a second family, which included son Bruce Austin Fraser (later 1st Baron Fraser of North Cape) (1888‚Äì1981). Fraser died in Steyning, Sussex, England in 1908.

Born in Galle, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Crusz immigrated to Toronto, Canada in 1965 and soon after began publishing poetry. Though his poetry deals with a wide variety of human experience, Crusz is best known for his poetry that illuminates his experience of immigration, migrancy and the alienation of exile. Crusz died in Waterloo, Ontario on 7th September 2017,[15] Early life As a young child Crusz's family moved to Colombo, where he attended high school at St. Joseph's and St. Peter's colleges. Crusz's education was in English, and he was exposed to much of the canon of Western literature including Shakespeare, Milton, and Dylan Thomas (to whom he is sometimes compared), which would later influence his writing. Nonetheless, his poetry cites Sri Lanka as a place of memory and longing, Buddhism in \\"Karma\\" and other poems, the sounds of the rabana drum and classical Sri Lankan dance, though as he said in a 2014 interview that his work is \\"not a travel book\\". His Catholic upbringing would also heavily influence his poetry especially \\"Gambolling with the Divine\\". Education and employment Crusz received a Bachelor of Arts in history at the University of Colombo in 1948. In 1951 Crusz went to England to study library science at the School of Librarianship and Archives at the University of London as a Colombo Plan Scholar. After returning from England Crusz worked at the Central Bank of Ceylon as chief reference librarian until immigrating to Canada in 1965. Crusz earned a Bachelor of Library Science at the University of Toronto after his arrival, and then attained a Master of Arts in History at the University of Waterloo. He remained at the University of Waterloo until 1993 as a senior reference and collections development librarian. His library work greatly influenced his non-fiction publications. Early literary work Crusz began his literary career as a storyteller for his three children. In Sri Lanka he wrote \\"Bumpis, the magic Elephant\\" which portrays Canada as a haven. Chelva Kanaganayakam describes this early story as \\"prophetic\\", as it foreshadows his later experience of immigration and exile. After his arrival in Canada, Crusz was encouraged to continue writing by Irving Layton, then published his first poems in several literary magazines and journals such as The Fiddlehead, The Malahat Review and Canadian Forum. Flesh and Thorn, put into print in 1974 with pen and ink drawings by Virgil Burnett, is Crusz's first published collection of poetry. Although much of Crusz's work has been described as autobiographic, it is Flesh and Thorn that most resounds with Crusz's personal life. Elephant and Ice, Crusz's second collection of poetry, was published in 1980 and reissued in a limited edition in 2005 of 500 numbered and signed copies. It has been most used to examine Crusz's comparisons of Canada and Sri Lanka. Crusz's work is full of dualities, the most apparent being that of his \\"negotiation\\" of Canada and Sri Lanka and where he stands in relation to each country. Even the title of this book is binary, with Elephant standing for Sri Lanka and Ice for Canada. The critic Arun Mukherjee writes in the essay \\"Songs of an Immigrant\\" that Crusz's binaries show that he is divided in his loyalties and that he uses his Sri Lankan past to \\"scrutinize his life in Canada\\". As a post-colonial poet, Crusz questions both homelands, Sri Lanka and Canada, but makes little reference to his time in England as a student. Later literary work Crusz went on to publish more volumes of poetry,\\"Singing against the Wind\\" (1985, reissued in 2005), A Time for Loving (1986), Still Close to the Raven (1989, reissued in 2008), The Rain Doesn't Know me Anymore (1992), Beatitudes of Ice (1995; reissued in 2008) and Insurgent Rain: Selected Poems 1974‚Äì1996 (1997) before publishing Lord of the Mountain: The Sardiel Poems (1999),\\"Love Where the Nights are Green\\" (2007) \\"Enough to be Mortal Now\\" (2009), \\"Don't tell me that I'm not an elephant\\" (2012), \\"How to Dance in this Rarefied Air\\" (2017). \\"In the Twilight of my Bones\\", a manuscript of new and unpublished poems, is awaiting publication. Lord of the Mountain is an anomaly among Crusz's works, a mixed genre (prose and poetry) work about the life, trial and death of the Sri Lankan Robin Hood, Sardiel. Sardiel was a famous Sri Lankan bandit of the mid-nineteenth century who robbed from the rich to help the poor. He was captured and hanged in 1864. Sardiel is generally celebrated in Sri Lanka as a national hero; many stories and articles have been written about him and he is a favourite story of Sri Lankan children Like the popular stories told about Sardiel, Crusz initially celebrates Sardiel in Lord of the Mountain by writing of Sardiel as the \\"champion of the underdog\\" and showing how Sardiel resented and resisted the occupation of the colonial British. In \\"Obituary for the Nakoti Chettiar\\" where \\"the body of one of the richest merchants in the city was found in a cruelly mangled state at the foot of a huge bo tree just outside a Buddhist temple\\" and in \\"The White Arabian's Flank\\" where \\"once, twice, three times, [Sardiel's] serrated blade flashes, finds it target\\" in an Arab horse trader's body,however, Crusz complicates the character of Sardiel by revealing his immoral side as well: Crusz portrays some of Sardiel's exploits as not necessarily being for the greater good. For example, when Sardiel begins to doubt the nobility in his crimes in the poem \\"Which Way?\\", the reader too has reason to doubt Sardiel's virtue in his actions as a criminal and after capture. Crusz also emphasised Sardiel's conversion from Buddhism to Christianity upon his capture in Lord of the Mountain. This historical fact underlines the dichotomies in this work and asks readers to think critically about the complex motives for the adoption of Christianity by Sri Lankans under colonial rule. In a private correspondence Crusz has described Sardiel's conversion as \\"courageous\\". Like Ondaatje's \\"The Collected Works of Billy the Kid\\", readers' sympathies are initially attached to a bandit as protagonist, only to find them questioned later without necessarily attaching to the antagonist. Non-fiction work Crusz also published several non-fiction books, of note is Ralph Nader: a Bibliography, 1960‚Äì1982, published at a time (first-edition, 1973) when Ralph Nader's views against triumphant consumerism were gaining understanding among the public. Critical reception After Crusz sent Irving Layton a few pieces when he first began writing, Layton said about them, \\"The poems are very good indeed\\". In Dark Antonyms and Paradise, the most comprehensive book about Crusz's work to date, Chelva Kanaganayakam has shown that Crusz is legitimate in his uses of the themes of immigration and alienation. Crusz's work appears in Sinhalese and English in Sri Lanka, in translation to French in \\"Ce qu'Ile dit\\" and in McGraw-Hill's \\"Constructing Meaning: Skills for Understanding Contemporary Texts\\". As a Sri Lankan writer in Canada, some would compare him with Michael Ondaatje. Further reading and archives *Kanaganayakam, Chelva.

His music has been described as glam rock, disco, electropunk, ska, electronic rock. He is also an accomplished painter and multimedia artist. Music career He spent his young years in Pianico, a small village in Bergamo next to Lake Iseo. At 12, he took part in Zecchino d'Oro, a musical competition for children, followed by Arricia's \\"Festival degli sconosciuti\\" at 15. While attending art school he learned to play guitar, he studied music and began playing in some local blues groups and a massive fan of Frank Zappa and John Mayall. After early release from military service for its flamboyant behavior, he met Nanni Ricordi, a music entrepreneur and was signed to the independent Italian record label Ultima Spiaggia, where he released his debut studio album UOAEI in 1975. In 1977, the follow up album Primo secondo e frutta (Ivan compreso) ironic glam rock album had great reception and his first commercial success with single \\"Maria Batman\\". A master of promotional schemes, he launched a book putting forward what he called the TATTOUDITOVISTAOLFATTOGUSTO (TUVOG) theory, in a book carrying the title and attaching a free LP to it. He also collaborated with newcomer producer and arranger Roberto Colombo.

The album also gave the huge single \\"Polisex\\", his definitive song, a staple song throughout the 1980s. In 1981, he tries to revive 1960s music with a new twist. This work appeared in his 1981 album 2060 Italian Graffiati with songs like \\"Nessuno mi pu√≤ giudicare\\" and \\"Una zebra a pois\\". He promoted the trend by appearing in the TV broadcast \\"Mr. Fantasy\\" where he became a regular guest. The album was a huge commercial success with reported sales of 475,000 copies. In 1982 he released the album Ivan il terribile with new songs he had written. In this period, he opened the discoth√®que \\"Bandiera Gialla\\" (meaning the Yellow Flag) in Rimini in partnership with Caterina Caselli and Red Ronnie.

From 1995 onward, he alternated his career as musician and his new career as painter and multimedia artist. In 1996, he adopted the pseudonym \\"Cut Ivan\\" specially after his dance single Love is love. In 1999, he acted in an avant- garde Italian-Polish cult film KK Kairos & Kronos about 1980s singers directed by Dario Maria Gulli, with players like Johnson Righeira, and Alessandra Di Sanzo. The film screened during the BresciaMusicArt event on 2 June 2000 becoming one of the finalists for the event. It was shown also at the New York Film Festival. In 2002, he inaugurated his new art exhibition Se dico... seduco? in which the visual effects of the paintings are mixed with digital effects. In the same year he took part in the musical Joseph e la strabiliante tunica dei sogni (an Italian version of Joseph and the Amazing Dreamcoat). He also presented a radio program on Radio Kiss Kiss. In 2003, during Giuni Russo's return to the Sanremo Music Festival, Cattaneo produced two of her music videos for \\"Morir√≤ d'amore\\" and \\"Una rosa √® una rosa\\". And in 2004, he took part in the IRai 2 reality show Music Farm, replacing Scialpi. He returned for seasons 2 and 3. In 2007, he was also involved in the reality show \\"L'isola dei famosi\\". In October 2005, he made a brief return to writing music after a 13 years of no album releases, with his new album Luna presente, with all 12 tracks composed by him, that included a remake of two revisited classics \\"Polisex\\" and \\"Crudele\\", produced by Roberto Cacciapaglia and Roy Tarrant. The album is dedicated to the moon and its 12 \\"metaphysical seas\\". With this album, Cattaneo reminisce his identity as a singer and used it as an opportunity to celebrate 30 years of artistic career.

The species is known from the latest Eocene sediments exposed in the state of Montana, USA. It is one of several extinct species placed in the living section Macrantha. History and classification Acer castorrivularis is represented by a single fossil specimen that was recovered from a late Eocene, possibly Chadronian aged, outcrop of the Beaver Creek flora. Although it was found north of the Ruby Flora, which outcrops in southeast Montana, the similarities in overall floral composition between the Beaver Creek, Ruby, and other Montana floras are interpreted by Wolfe and Tanai to indicate that the assemblages are coeval in nature. The age of the Ruby flora is considered to range from approximately to approximately or as young as , meaning a probable similar age for the Beaver Creek assemblage. The Beaver Creek assemblage was host to a total of six Acer species in 1987: A. castorrivularis, A. florissanti, A. lincolnense, A. milleri, A. salmonense, and A. tiffneyi. The species was described from a lone type specimen, the holotype leaf specimen UCMP 93l0A, B. Both the part and counterpart of the type specimen are currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections housed at the University of California Museum of Paleontology in Berkeley, California. The specimen was studied by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University. Wolfe and Tanai published their 1987 type description for A. castorrivularis in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The etymology of the chosen specific name castorrivularis is a combination of the words \\"Castor\\", the genus name for beavers, and \\"rivularis\\", Latin for rill or brook, in recognition of the type and only location for the species at Beaver Creek. Description The leaves of Acer castorrivularis are simple in structure and are generally ovate in shape, with perfectly actinodromous vein structure in which the primary veins originate at the base of the lamina and run out towards the margin. The leaves are unlobed and have five primary veins of which the basal pair are weakly developed, and have an estimated size of long by wide in overall dimension. The morphology of A. castorrivularis suggests placement into the Acer section Macrantha. This is based on the overall vein structure and small uniformly sized teeth, although it is the only Tertiary member of section Macrantha to be unlobed.

The museum is currently the seventh largest insect collection in North America with more than seven million specimens of terrestrial and freshwater arthropods. At least 90% of these holdings are insects. The collection is worldwide in scope with the Western Hemisphere, Indonesia, and Australasia particularly well represented. Role The principal roles of the museum are to support research at the graduate and undergraduate levels, informatics and diagnostics, and educational outreach. Areas of taxonomic specialization include the worldwide insect order Hymenoptera, freshwater non-insect arthropods, and California insect fauna. Professor Emeritus of entomology Richard M. Bohart was the museum's founder and principal contributor. In 1986 the museum was named in his honor.Bohart Museum website homepage The museum is closely tied to the Entomology Department at UC Davis and provides research support for the department. This role is particularly important for the faculty of biological control and medical entomology groups. The museum also houses teaching insect collections for undergraduate level entomology courses taught on campus. Specimen collection Each year an average of 30,000 newly acquired specimens are added to the collection. These specimens come from museum based field studies, university faculty, and student research programs. There is also a considerable number of specimens donated to the museum from the members of the Bohart Museum Society and the external community. 7,400 specimens from the museum are estimated to be on loan each year to domestic and international researchers. Local, national, and international researchers use the museum's collection materials in at least 18 publications per year in addition to the high publication activity of the university staff and associates. An average of 12,000 visitors come to the Bohart Museum each year.

Even if A is a nonstandard œÉ-algebra, the algebra A need not be an ordinary œÉ-algebra as it is not usually closed under countable unions. Instead the algebra A has the property that if a set in it is the union of a countable family of elements of A, then the set is the union of a finite number of elements of the family, so in particular any finitely additive map (such as Œº) from A to the extended reals is automatically countably additive. Define M to be the œÉ-algebra generated by A. Then by Carath√©odory's extension theorem the measure Œº on A extends to a countably additive measure on M, called a Loeb measure.

History The first co- operative in Limans Following the events of May 68 groups of students from Austria and Switzerland who held anarchist ideologies collaborated to raise funds to allow them to buy land upon which to start to farm collectively. In 1973 they purchased 270 hectares of land at Limans near Forcalquier. The communities ideological leader was Roland Perrot, a military deserter from the war in Algeria. Perrot knew Jean Giono and had experienced the free commune in Contadour in the 1930s. The ideological focus of the community is anti- militarist and pacifist, anti-capitalist and egalitarian. Activities focus upon self-sufficiency, community life, craft and agricultural production, the joint management of energy, water and respect for the environment.

It was released in October 2010. It is written by Fred Van Lente and Koontz, with illustrations by Queenie Chan in a manga style. Plot summary It is Halloween in Pico Mundo, California, and there is a whiff of something wicked in the autumn air. While the town prepares for its annual festivities, young fry cook Odd Thomas cannot shake the feeling that make-believe goblins and ghouls are not the only things on the prowl. And he should know, since he can see what others cannot: the spirits of the restless dead. But even his frequent visitor, the specter of Elvis Presley, cannot seem to point Odd in the right direction. With the help of his gun-toting girlfriend, Stormy, Odd is out to uncover the terrible truth. Is something sinister afoot in the remote barn guarded by devilish masked men? Has All Hallows Eve mischief taken a malevolent turn? Or is the pleading ghost of a trick-or-treater a frightening omen of doom? Characters Odd Thomas Odd Thomas is the protagonist of the Odd Thomas series. He is a short-order cook at the Pico Mundo grill, who has the ability to see the lingering dead. He uses this ability to try and bring peace to the ghosts he encounters, so that they can move on to the next life. Traumatic childhood experiences left him extremely uncomfortable with guns, so he relies on his resourcefulness to escape the sometimes hostile situations in which he finds himself. Stormy Llewellyn Stormy Llewellyn is Odd's girlfriend and soulmate. She grew up in an orphanage, except for a six-month stint in which she was adopted by a family, only to be sexually abused. Stormy intends to marry Odd, but she is waiting until she overcomes her traumatic past. She does not share Odd's fear of guns, and carries a pistol with which she provides backup for Odd on his adventures. Chief Wyatt Porter Wyatt Porter is the Chief of Police in Pico Mundo, and serves as a father figure to Odd. He is one of the few people who are aware of Odd's abilities, and has sometimes been able to catch elusive criminals with Odd's paranormal help.

Initially he advocated regionalism for Corsica within the French state. He briefly supported Italian irredentism in Corsica in the later 1930sItalian irredentism in Corsica: Pietro Rocca, before returning to a position of French-Corsican regionalism during World War II. Early Life Pietro (Petru in Corsican) Rocca was a printer by trade, and before 1914 contributed to the original Corsican cultural magazine A Tramuntana. Called up for military action in World War I he was wounded on multiple occasions and wrote about his wartime experiences. In recognition of his service he was decorated with the French Legion of Honor. Corsica, like France's other heavily agricultural regions, was heavily affected by the casualties of the war. Rocca returned to Ajaccio and, with other combat veterans disillusioned in the French state and nation, founded the Corsican literary magazine A Muvra (the Muflon). This journal offered a home to a range of Corsican political projects, ranging from simple decentralisation within France, to an independent state, to merging into the Italian state. Differing political contexts during the interwar would lead to each of the currents gaining popularity at different times. A Muvra led to the formation of the first Corsican regionalist party, the Partitu Corsu d'Azione (1922 to 1926), modelled on the Sardinian regionalist party in Italy, the Partito Sardo d'Azione.Isidre Molas. Partis nationalistes, Autonomie et clans en Corse p.10 (in French) Rocca highlighted the successful examples of other national movements in Europe: Home Rule and Sinn F√©in in Ireland; the Mancomunitat and Generalitat in Catalonia, and the ongoing efforts of the Breton nationalist movement Breizh Atao in France. But between 1925 and 1928, in the context of the Alsatian regionalist crisis, the French state adopted a severe stance towards regionalism. Petru Rocca and many of the PCA began to doubt the French state's goodwill towards self-rule for regional nationalities. He affirmed France to be a state formed by multiple nationalities - Alsatian, Basque, Breton, Catalan and Flemish, as well as Corsican - and demanded that these be granted regional self-rule within a multi-national French state. Petru Roccia therefore represented Corsica when, in 1926, the various regiona-national movements of France founded an umbrella association to coordinate their efforts, the Central Committee for the National Minorities of France. In 1927 Rocca set up a more hardline party, the Partitu autonomista di Corsica, backed by monsignor Domenico Parlotti and Dr. Croce, director of the Archivi di Stato della Corsica. literary review of Petru Rocca  The 1930s and Second World War  During the late 1930s the crisis of the French state prompted many of the leaders of France's interwar national movements to slowly evolve from regionalism (greater self-rule within the French Republic) to separatism or irridentism with a neighbouring state, often losing patience with the French state and openly accepting the patronage of Nazi Germany. This was the case for Olivier Mordrel in Brittany, l'abb√© Gantois in French Flanders et Hermann Bickler, who together coordinated their efforts through the journal Peuples et fronti√®res(1936 to 1938) - the Corsican perspective was provided by Rocca. During this period, Rocca's opinions followed a similar path. From 1935 Rocca and A Muvra began to openly reject the idea that Corsica had a place within the French state, a position developed in contact with other Corsican intellectuals such as Petru Giovacchini, Marco Angeli di Sart√®na, and Marta Renucci. The end result was Italian irredentism, the idea that Corsica (through its language and long historical connections) was a culturally-Italic nation and would be better off merging into the Kingdom of Italy. This position was actively encouraged by Mussolini, who wished to acquire territories from France with historically Italic culture such as Corsica, Nice and Savoy. But whereas Italian linguists, sponsored by the Fascist government, presented the Corsican language as one of the dialects of Italian (with the political undertone that Corsica 'belonged' to Italy), Rocca maintained that Corsican and Italian were two distinct languages descended from a common ancestor. He was thus a bit suspicious of Mussolini's plans to absorb Corsica just as France had done, and by the end of World War Two had lost enthusiasm for the idea of Corsican union with Italy. In any event Rocca had attracted the suspicion of French police, which made little distinction between full Italian-Corsican irridentists and French-Corsican autonomists.

Additions in 1841 were by the Edinburgh architect William Burn.Galloway House up for Sale at gallowaygazette.co.uk/news, accessed 29 December 2011 A high wall around the garden was constructed during the by French prisoners of war, in or during the Napoleonic Wars. The house and estate were owned by the Earls of Galloway until 1908, when they were forced to sell up. The buyer was Sir Malcolm McEacharn, who developed the garden. In 1930 the house and park were sold again to Lady Forteviot, widow of John Dewar, 1st Baron Forteviot, of the Dewar's Whisky family. She died in 1940, when the house became a hospital for men injured during the Second World War. Lady Forteviot's step-grandson, Edward Strutt, added to the garden, but in 1947 the house was sold to Glasgow Corporation, and until 1976 was a boarding school.

It registered a magnitude of 8.0 on the surface wave magnitude scale and had a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. Tectonic setting The state of Oaxaca lies above the convergent boundary where the Cocos Plate is being subducted below the North American Plate at a rate of 6.4 cm/yr. The dip of the subducting slab is about 15¬∞ as defined by focal mechanisms and earthquake hypocenters. Seismicity in this area is characterised by regular megathrust earthquakes along the plate interface. In addition, there have been a series of historical normal fault events within the subducting slab. The area affected by moderate seismic intensities is about four times greater for the normal fault events compared to those on the plate interface and the peak horizontal acceleration is also higher in most cases. Earthquake The earthquake is characterized as a normal fault event, and was the strongest in that area since the 1911 Michoac√°n earthquake. It caused no surface ruptures and did not generate a tsunami. From limited seismographic data, it is inferred to have had a focal depth of about 40 km. Analysis indicates that the rupture occurred deep down- dip within the subducted lithospheric slab, possibly breaking through the entire thickness of the slab. Damage Early reporting from the Los Angeles Times described the city of Oaxaca as being in ruins. Seventy per cent of its buildings were either completely destroyed or badly damaged. Messages were said to be fragmented coming over damaged communication systems as a result of telegraph lines having been knocked down. One message that did get through was from General Evaristo Perez, a military commander in the state of Oaxaca, to president Pascual Ortiz Rubio stating at least 25 persons were dead. Veracruz and Tampico reported light damage and one death was reported in Mexico city. The town of Miahuatl√°n de Porfirio D√≠az, located between Oaxaca and the coast, was reported to be completely destroyed. Aftermath Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein, who was in Mexico working on a film, flew to Oaxaca shortly after the earthquake to film conditions in the affected area. After having returned to Mexico City, Eisenstein reported on the deaths of 71 persons in Guelatova while attending a fiesta in a church there. A total of 114 deaths were ultimately attributed to the earthquake. Many people abandoned the city of Oaxaca after the earthquake and low property prices meant that a small number of families were able to gain ownership of most of the city. A magnitude 7.5 earthquake on September 30, 1999 had a hypocenter close to that of the 1931 earthquake.

Biography Wilson was born at Brompton Square, London, on 13 February 1827. His father was Charles Corbett Wilson, a solicitor of Gray's Inn, London. CAC Wilson was educated by private tutors and at the Western Grammar School, Brompton, and was articled in 1846 to the Westminster area engineering firm of Messrs. Griffin and Downing. He arrived in Victoria, Australia on 10 August 1851 aboard the Troubadour and did gold diggings at Golden Point until he decided that he could not be successful at it. He left Ballarat and practised as a surveyor in Geelong, and subsequently went on to have one of the longest careers of any engineer in Victoria; he was responsible for a number of important engineering works. In the late 1850s, Wilson carried out the original survey for the Melbourne‚ÄìGeelong Railway and then joined the Central Road Board as assistant engineer in the Western district, which appointment he held until 1860. He was employed in the construction of the original Iron Barwon Bridge at Geelong, the Shelford Bridge over the River Leigh and the first bridge on the present site at Cressy.Alsop, P. F. B., 1971, 'History of the Shelford iron bridge over the Leigh River, Bannockburn‚ÄìRokewood Road, Shire of Leigh' He later expressed a debt to the training he received there under Charles Rowand. Wilson practised his profession for sixty-four years (1846‚Äì1910, and was Engineer for the Shires of Leigh (1863‚Äì1910) and Bannockburn. He was responsible for many iron, timber and concrete bridges in western Victoria. He was succeeded by his eldest son Charles Corbett Powell Wilson as shire engineer on his retirement.Gary Vines, Metal Bridges in Victoria, 2004 In 1860 he undertook took several large Government survey contracts in the Western district, including Chatsworth, Grassdale and Murndal, Montajup and Dunkeld, and Mount William. In October, 1863, he was appointed secretary, treasurer, and engineer to the Shelford District Road Board which later became the Shire of Leigh, where he stayed until his retirement in October, 1917 - a period of 54 years. He was a member of the Victorian Institute of Engineers and of the Victorian Institute of Surveyors. In 1857 he married a daughter of Connor Powell, an old settler of the Waurn Ponds; of 15 children, 7 sons and three daughters survived him.VETERAN ENGINEER'S DEATH, The Argus 11 Oct. 1923, p. 14.

Wilson paid close attention to these developments and made practical application of the theory. Most of Victoria's municipal engineers in the nineteenth century regarded themselves as 'practical men', and were suspicious of too much theory, so Wilson can be seen as a radical and adventurous municipal engineer who was willing to take advantage of the best engineering theory and testing facilities available.

The work was originally titled Etude fantastique en double-sons (Fantastic Study in Double Notes), and was infamously referred to by Schumann as the \\"hardest piece ever written\\"‚Äîto this day it remains as \\"one of the most ferociously difficult pieces in the piano repertoire\\". A series of alternating chords introduce the main theme. The development features rapid unison octaves and counterpoint. There is advanced chromaticism and syncopation throughout the work. A typical performance of this piece (with the repeat sign observed) can last anywhere from six to eight minutes. Schumann dedicated the work to his friend Ludwig Schuncke, who had dedicated his Grande Sonata in G minor, Op. 3, to Schumann. It is partially based on the Czerny Toccata in C major, Op. 92, which Clara Schumann spent much of her youth practicing.

Events are usually held on large paved areas, such as parking lots or airfields. Courses consist of turns, offsets, and slaloms marked by traffic cones; new courses are typically created for each event. The Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) is the largest autocross sanctioning body in the United States; the National Auto Sport Association (NASA) and various manufacturer-affiliated and independent clubs also hold events.  Event structure  Before driving, competitors typically walk the course to learn its layout and develop a strategy for driving it. Drivers generally have three or more timed runs on the course, which usually last between thirty and ninety seconds. When not competing, most events require competitors to assist with event operations, usually by spotting and repositioning cones that other drivers have hit (colloquially known as ‚Äúworking the course‚Äù). Participation Autocross is an inexpensive form of motorsport. The potential for damage is lower than most other motorsport disciplines because of autocross' low average speeds, the lack of physical barriers alongside the course, and the fact that only one car navigates a given section of the course at a time. Unlike most other motorsports, most participants compete in street-driven vehicles. A helmet is required, but many clubs have helmets available to be borrowed. Some clubs provide instruction for novice participants. The SCCA has parallel classes (‚ÄúLadies‚Äù) specifically for female competitors; women may compete in either the regular (‚ÄúOpen‚Äù) or Ladies classes. SCCA classes While classes and rules vary between sanctioning bodies, the SCCA's classing structure is used by many independent clubs. The SCCA classing structure consists of six primary categories; in approximate order of ascending level of modification, the categories are Street, Street Touring, Street Prepared, Street Modified, Prepared, and Modified. Street classes allow very little change from the car's original manufacture; most items that can be changed are normal wear items (filters, street-legal tires, shocks or struts and ignition wires). There are nine Street classes, ranging from Super Street for sports cars like the Porsche 911 GT3 and second-generation Acura NSX to H Street for cars like the Ford Fiesta ST and Honda Civic. Street Touring and Street Prepared classes allow some modifications to the suspension (wheels, springs, shocks), external engine parts (intakes and exhaust manifolds), and the interior (replacement of seats). Street Modified cars retain production-based bodies and motors and are street-legal vehicles, but little else is stock. Prepared class is for production-based race cars with stripped interiors, major suspension changes, heavily-modified motors, and racing slick tires. Prepared cars are typically transported in trailers because they are not street-legal. The SCCA D- and E-Modified classes also have production cars, but allow any automotive-based engine, suspension redesign, and complete replacement of the body (typically with lightweight alloys or composites) as long as the original car is still recognizable. Although there are classes for purpose-built race cars imported from other series (including Formula Fords, D Sports Racers, Formula 500s and vehicles similar to American oval-track stock cars), most autocross cars are based on production cars. The fastest autocross cars are purpose-built \\"specials\\" (A Modified in SCCA Solo) with small lightweight bodies, sticky tires, powerful engines, and short gears. While their top speeds are typically limited by gearing, their transient cornering capabilities exceed those of vehicles not designed for autocross. Related sports Autocross is also known as Solo (the SCCA's brand name) in the United States. Other regions of the world use different names. Parts of Canada and Eastern Europe (including Russia, Ukraine, and Moldova) call it autoslalom. In the United Kingdom, autocross is known as autosolo and is held on grass and dirt. In Southeast Asia, Malaysia and Thailand refer to the sport as autokhana. Motorkhana (Australia and New Zealand) and autotesting (the UK and Ireland) are related sports. With speeds rarely exceeding 40 mph (60 km/h), motorkhana and autotesting are slower than American autocross, require hand-braking, and have sections that must be navigated in reverse. Autocross speeds can exceed 60 mph (100 km/h), and courses requiring drivers to reverse are generally prohibited. Hand-braking is also uncommon, and not usually necessary on a typical autocross course. They are similar to the Japanese gymkhana, another type of handling competition. Gymkhanas are tighter than motorkhanas and autotests, with numerous 360-degree turns around cones and courses which loop back on themselves. Fast times require sliding, and resembles a combination of autocross and drifting. Gymkhana does not usually require backing up. In ProSolo, an SCCA-sanctioned variant of autocross, two cars run side by side on mirror-image courses after starting at a \\"Christmas tree\\" starting system similar to that used in drag racing.Sports Car Club of America (2016). \\"SCCA¬Æ ProSolo¬Æ National Series Rules\\".

As a member of the Camera Club of New York from 1930‚Äì34, he was heavily influenced by fellow members Paul Strand and Henwar Rodakiewicz.A letter from Henwar Rodakiewicz, Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts to Ned Scott, New York, New York, November 7, 1932 Form was his goddess, his muse. The photographic process was a constant search for the right form, the pure essence, the truth of anything. Creativity was a battle, a struggle between his exacting eye and the nature of his contrary and rebellious self.Letter, Ned Scott to Gladys von Ettinghausen, July 29, 1935 That battle always intrigued him, but left him exhausted. Since form ascendent was the essence of Scott's creativity, he parted company with practitioners of the Photo-Secession movement such as Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen of earlier decades. The shape of anything always preceded the idea of its truth, not the reverse. Reality was a function of structure, not the thought process. Capturing that structural truth was the driving force of his photography.  Early commercial work  While living in New York and visiting the Camera Club, Ned Scott began commercial work with still lifes and x-ray tubes. He experimented with light and form during this period. Unfortunately little survives except that which he saved for his own personal collection. His other photographic efforts during this time included a study of La Iglesia de San Francisco in Ranchos de Taos, New Mexico.  Mexico  Scott spent the latter half of 1934 working for Paul Strand on location in Alvarado, Mexico to produce the Mexican funded propaganda film, Redes. Fred Zinnemann, who also worked on this film in his directorial debut, referred to Scott's stills as \\"classics\\" in his autobiography. Two months following Strand's return to the USA from Mexico, he referred to these stills as \\"the finest set of still photographs I have ever seen for any film\\". His assignment was the creation of film stills during the production of the film. He used a 5 x 7 Graflex camera throughout production. He masked the back plate of the camera to a 5 x 6 size at the suggestion of Paul Strand, thus producing exposed film which was a little smaller than usual. Because the sun was so intense at the midday period, filming of Redes took place in the early morning and late afternoon. Zinnemann made this filming schedule due to the fact that most of the participants wore large straw hats, characteristic of the culture and area, and these hats created very dark shadows over the actors' facial features. So it was that during this midday time, Scott had the opportunity to make photographic forays into the community of Alvarado to document the town. He also used this time to make character portraits. Conditions in Alvarado were spartan, and travel took time. Crossing the Mexican border was problematic because of sensitivities of the Mexican government to immigrant labor, often causing delays of days for telegrams to be transmitted back and forth with officials in the government. Overall Alvarado was a very shabby place. There was dirt everywhere. Facial qualities of the local population were strong, perhaps due to the African American genetic strain within the group but there was \\"an appalling amount of toothlessness\\". Known as Jarochos, members of the local population laughed, sang and drank (aguardiente) as a normal course of things. Throughout Mexico Alvarado was known as the most foul-mouthed village anywhere. Despite the local color, both Strand and Rodakiewicz found the town and its people terribly depressing. Underlying this feature, however, was a vitality and a specialness which lent possibilities for a good film. But at the end of 1933, when Henwar arrived to assist in the film's production, he found the scenario ragged and incoherent.Letter, Henwar Rodakiewicz to Ned Scott, October 21, 1933:http://www.thenedscottarchive.com/redesfilm/redes- film-letters.html Scott arrived in Alvarado in June 1934. Zinnemann was already there, having arrived in January at the request of Henwar to take over the role of film director after Henwar left to complete a prior commitment on a Stirner film about American Pueblo Indians.Henwar Rodakiewicz Santa Fe, New Mexico to Georgia O'Keeffe, New York, January 30, 1934 Prior to his departure, Henwar had also completed the shooting script for Strand because he did not feel right about leaving Strand alone in the production of the film. There was no one else on hand in Alvarado who grasped the enormous possibilities of cinema or who knew anything about making a film. By June, the production team was finally assembled, Henwar having returned from the Pueblo job, and filming could commence.Henwar Rodakiewicz, Mexico D.F, to Ned Scott, New York, December 17, 1933:http://www.thenedscottarchive.com/redesfilm/redes-film- letters.htmlScott began his first film still assignment with a rookie director, a rookie producer and a group of rookie actors in a foreign town whose inhabitants were renowned for their drinking and swearing. And he worked for free. Gunther von Fritsch, the editor of the film, arrived and joined the film crew on October 26, 1934. He was enchanted with the town (he landed in Alvarado during a lengthy fiesta with dancing in the plaza and fireworks every night). His work began immediately, but there were problems. Equipment on hand was primitive as there were no light boxes, cutting tables or bins to organize the film trims, and much had to be improvised. Electricity was unreliable, and when available, it was fluctuating, causing the moviola and projector to run at erratic speeds, a circumstance which hampered timing. Gunther got as much done as he could in Alvarado, then went to Mexico City on November 2 to record the musical score.Letter, Gunther von Fritsch to William Alexander, August 18, 1976:http://www.thenedscottarchive.com/redesfilm/redes-film-letters.html#gvf  Hollywood years  Scott arrived in Hollywood in February 1935 and took up residence with Zinnemann, Rodakiewicz and von Fritsch in a studio apartment complex at 7900 Honey Drive, North Hollywood.Letter Paul Strand, Santa Fe, New Mexico to Ned Scott 7900 Honey Drive, Hollywood, California January 29, 1935. University of Louisville Special Collections Photographic Archive With his New York experience and recently finished film effort in Mexico, Scott began free lance work as a still photographer. He was soon to come to the notice of producers David Loew, Walter Wanger and Lester Cowan for whom he photographed films in the latter half of the 1930s and early 1940s. Most notable are the two Walter Wanger films Stagecoach (1939) and The Long Voyage Home (1941). Both of these films were directed by John Ford. Some of his most recognizable work was yet to be created, however. In March 1945, he signed a contract to perform still and portrait photography with Columbia Pictures, becoming a contract employee for the first time since entering Hollywood. Over the next three years Scott worked with such stars as Rita Hayworth, Glenn Ford, Humphrey Bogart, and Janet Blair. Salary was structured at $250 per week beginning the first year, then rising to $300 per week for the second year, and $350.00 per week for the last year.Contracts, pp. 1 This period was his most prolific during which he shot 50,000 frames a year.Awards:http://www.thenedscottarchive.com/hollywood/awards.html Scott was recognized for the quality of his photography. Even though he had no formal, institutional training in photography prior to beginning his Hollywood career, Scott soon found his still photographs published in books and nationally circulated periodicals. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honored him with an 11 x 14 display of his character study image of Barry Fitzgerald as \\"Cocky\\" from The Long Voyage Home. This exhibit was billed as a \\"Hollywood Studios Still Photography Show\\" featuring \\"Stars in Camera Art\\" in Fall of 1940.Character Portrayals:http://www.thenedscottarchive.com/hollywood/character-actor- portrayals.html In the February 19 issue of Look Magazine, the editors honored him with a Photo of the Year award in 1946. The image which won him this award arose from his work for the film Tars and Spars. A key method utilized to capture the most convincing portraits of actors in character was the \\"swing to\\" shot. Facing away from an 8 x 10 camera lens, the actor spoke lines as though on the sound stage with cameras running. All the incipient force of the actor's character emerged as the lines from the script were uttered. Then, without hesitation, the actor rotated to face the camera, giving Scott the perfect portrayal of the screen character.

The nineteenth typhoon and final super typhoon of the 1991 Pacific typhoon season, Yuri was a tropical disturbance that strengthened into a tropical depression on November 22 in the Philippine Sea. Moving rather slowly at first, the system continued to intensify, and was given the name Yuri. It had become a severe tropical storm about 1,480 kilometers east of Truk Island and took on a west-northwestward track at 22 km/h. Typhoon intensity was attained that night when Yuri was 1,050 km. Yuri turned more to the west on 26 November and reached peak intensity the following morning packing winds of over 220 km/h near its centre. Moving northwestwards at 30 km/h, Yuri passed 140 km to the south-southwest of Guam on the evening of November 27. After recurving November 29, Yuri accelerated northeastwards on November 30 and weakened to a severe tropical storm that night. By the morning of December 1, it had degenerated into a tropical storm about a few hundred kilometers east-northeast of Iwo Jima. Extratropical transition was completed soon afterward, and the storm's remnants persisted until December 3. Although Yuri never directly made landfall, it still had managed to cause $3 million (1991 USD) in damage to Pohnpei, including the loss of a radio tower. In Guam, the storm caused extensive beach erosion and destroyed between 60 and 350 buildings. There, damage totaled $33 million (1991 USD).Joint Typhoon Warning Center.‚ÄúSuper Typhoon Yuri‚Äù Retrieved on 2007-05-18. It is one of the most closely observed storms ever; its eye was studied for research. Meteorological history In mid-November, the presence of low-level westerlies in the central Pacific provided suitable atmospheric conditions for tropical cyclogenesis. The rapid development of thunderstorm activity near the Marshall Islands on November 16 prompted the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to monitor the area for signs of development. The disturbance tracked slowly in a counter-clockwise loop over the next few days as it slowly organized, and at 0000 UTC on November 22, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression, with the JTWC following suit about a day later. Upon becoming classified as a tropical cyclone, the system underwent explosive intensification, reaching tropical storm strength based on satellite intensity estimates on November 23\\\\. Yuri later reached typhoon intensity at 1200 UTC on November 24 located roughly 335 km (210 mi) east of Pohnpei while exhibiting an eye. At 0540 UTC on November 25, Yuri passed 85 km (55 mi) north of Pohnpei with winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). During this time, the typhoon began a phase of unimpeded and steady intensification, contrary to most intense typhoons which typically strengthen dramatically in short bursts. Concurrently, Yuri expanded in size, reaching a maximum diameter of 600 km (370 mi) at one point. At 0000 UTC on November 27, the JMA assessed the storm to have reached its peak intensity with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 895 mbar (hPa; 26.43 inHg). The JTWC analyzed winds at this time to have been equivalent to a Category 5 major hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale (SSHS). Rounding the western periphery of a subtropical ridge, Yuri began to take a more northerly course, bringing it within 100 km (60 mi) of Guam on November 27 as a strong typhoon. After passing south of the island, the typhoon weakened but continued to grow in size, reaching an estimated 900 km (560 mi) in diameter upon clearing the Northern Mariana Islands. After recurving towards the northeast the storm accelerated and began transitioning into an Extratropical cyclone. Yuri weakened below typhoon status early on December 1 shortly before completing the transitioning. The remnants restrengthened to a powerful hurricane force cyclone due to baroclinic processes. Continuing to track northward, they were last noted on December 3. Impact Pohnpei On Pohnpei, the storm had caused a loss of a radio tower. The total damage on the island of Pohnpei was totaled to $3 million (1991 USD). Guam On the United States territory of Guam, the large yet particularly dangerous and destructive tropical cyclone passed this western Pacific island on November 27. The storm brought wind gusts of up to 115 mph to the territory. The storm caused 2,500 people into shelters. The storm also produced high waves as tall as a two-story building to the Guam shoreline. The storm also managed to dump 4 inches of rain on the Territory. As civil defense and other workers tried to recover from the 24-foot waves and 115 mph winds of Typhoon Yuri, about three-quarters of Guam remained without electricity on November 28. But Guam was spared the full brunt of Yuri. It missed the island by 50 miles. No deaths were reported from the storm. Nearly all of Guam (ninety percent of the 133,000 residents) remained without water and electricity on November 29, nearly two days after the powerful tropical cyclone passed Guam. 2,500 of the residents that took shelters were crammed into 12 school shelters on November 28.YURI PASSES GUAM The Daily News.

The Spanish word for buffalo as used in New Mexico is cibolo; hence, the name Cibolero for buffalo hunter. Comancheria, the Cibolero hunting range Ciboleros hunted the American bison or buffalo on the Great Plains of what is now eastern New Mexico and Texas, mostly in the areas of the Llano Estacado and Comancheria. Their domain ranged as far east and north as Nebraska. The Ciboleros typically hunted buffalo in late fall once the summer crops had been harvested. Many Ciboleros from New Mexico lived along or near the Pecos River from the villages of San Jos√©, San Miguel del Vado, and Tecolote and south toward La Cuesta (now the town of Villanueva, New Mexico). The Ciboleros were primarily hunters while the contemporaneous comancheros were mostly traders with the Comanche and other Plains Indians although the two activities overlapped. History Josiah Gregg gave this description of a Cibolero he encountered: John Miller Morris explained the historical significance of the Ciboleros: The Cibolero way of life ended by the late 1870s with the destruction of the American bison. Ciboleros are still remembered in New Mexican folk songs, cultural events, and family oral traditions. Fictional Ciboleros are an integral part of some works of fiction dealing with the Southwest and the American West. For example, Jos√©'s Buffalo Hunt: A Story from History recounts a cibolero buffalo hunt c. 1866.

He was father of a Polish inventor Kazimierz Pr√≥szy≈Ñski. Career Pr√≥szy≈Ñski began teaching at the age of 23. In the summer of 1874 he set up a study course for illiterate adults around Ka≈Çuszyn and Mroz√≥w villages in Masovia. In 1875, he published his first folding poster to be used by students as the on-the-wall primer. It was his first great publishing success, printed in 5,000 copies and sold out in less than a month. It was reprinted again, this time with 15,000 copies in country-wide circulation. He signed his publications with a literary pseudonym (a ray of light). Due to broad popularity of his first educational poster, towards the end of 1875 Pr√≥szy≈Ñski wrote the first of his three most important works: Primer, Where You Learn to Read in 5 or 8 Weeks (, 1875); printed in more than a million copies in the next 33 years. It has been described as the first modern elementary primer. Also in 1875, he wrote (On Father Stanis≈Çaw Staszic) whose experience inspired him; as well as his next educational volume: \\"Pierwsza ksiƒÖ≈ºeczka dla wprawy w czytaniu\\" (First Book for Practice in Reading, 1875). On top of that, on May 1, 1875 along with two friends and co- conspirators, Pr√≥szy≈Ñski signed a founding act of the highly secretive (Society for National Education). His publications became a financial downpour for his publisher, but not for Pr√≥szy≈Ñski who received little royalty. He decided to print and distribute his works by himself. In 1878 he formally registered his own publishing company called Konrad Pr√≥szy≈Ñski National Bookstore (). This step turned into the journey of a lifetime combining a publishing venue with a mail-order service. Broad recognition Grave at the PowƒÖzki Cemetery Pr√≥szy≈Ñski wrote and self-published the next versions of his primer, as well as new textbooks for self-education and self-directed learning, including The Pictorial Book for Reading and Writing (, 1879). The book was sent to England in 1893 for an exhibition organized by the British scientific society (the 1893 International Exhibition by the Pedagogical Society of London). There, it won the first prize in its own category, as the best primer in the world. In 1880 Pr√≥szy≈Ñski applied to the Tsarist authorities for a permit to publish a Polish-language weekly. His Holiday Gazette () first appeared in January 1881. He published it alone, although he was denied the more formal role of its editor-in-chief. He distributed it via regular mail by subscription. The gazette was one of his longest-lasting endeavours, held for the next 28 years, until the end of his life. It was under constant attack by Russian censorship. Thanks to prior contacts established for the distribution of primers, the Gazette was sent as far as North and South America, as well as Africa and Asia. Those foreign editions often carried articles that were censored in the Polish edition. Pr√≥szy≈Ñski died in 1908, three years after the Polish Revolution of 1905.

Sch√∂ning moved his residency to the archbishop's palace at Kokenhusen in 1528 because of the conflict with the city of Riga and the Order of Livonia. He found unusual support in Duke Albert of Prussia, who was part of the Protestant movement. Duke Albrecht recommended Sch√∂ning appoint the duke's brother, Wilhelm von Brandenburg, as his coadjutor (assistant) and eventual successor. His body was buried in the parish church of Kokenhusen. Eventually, the Archbishopric of Riga and the Livonian Order were dissolved in 1561 after the conversion of the territory from Catholicism to Lutheranism at the beginning of Swedish rule. Coins minted in Riga between 1528 and 1539 bore this family coat of arms of Archbishop of Riga Thomas Sch√∂ning - two beams at angle with three Linden trees.

Bagh, Kolkata. The ghat has a tall colonial structure, which is the landing berth of the ghat. It is a fine Doric-Greek style pavilion with huge pillars. The ghat, originally known was Baboo Raj Chandra Ghat, is now only known by first words Baboo-ghat or Babu-ghat. Babu / Baboo in Bengali means Sahib or gentleman. The ghat is named after Babu Raj Chandra Das, husband of Rani Rashmoni and zamindar of Janbazar, who built it in 1830, in memory of her late husband.Ghats Of Decay & Despair Times of India, dated 6 November 2010. A marble tablet beneath the pediment implies that some of the credit for the erection of the ghat must go to Lord William Bentinck as he encouraged such spending with a view to improve public amenities. It is second oldest ghat of Kolkata. People performing Chhat Puja on Babughat, Kolkata The pavilion today is completely encroached by vendors and priests. The old colonial structure and stairs leading to the river are in various stages of decay and derelict. A section of ghat originally meant for bathing of ladies has turned into a garbage point now. Even so, the ghat is bustling with crowds since morning till late evening with people who use it for bathing, puja, religious ceremonies, massage and leisure. During Chhat Puja, a huge crowd can be seen on Babughat performing their puja. The ghat is also used during Durga Puja, Saraswati Puja rather in all festivals for immersion of idols.

The water ferry is run and maintained by Inland Waterways Corporation. Ferry services are available from Babughat to Howrah, Chandpal Ghat, Telkal Ghat and Bally.Ferry services in Kolkata Babughat Bus Terminus Also just outside the ghat is a bus terminus. Babughat is one of the main bus termini in the Kolkata apart from two others located at Esplanade and Howrah station. From there one can find interstate buses going into Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and other cities of West Bengal. Also there is another bus terminus from where one can find buses going in all directions of Kolkata and its neighborhood.Terrorists using Babughat as transit point Times of India, 25 November 2010. These buses also carry the goods and merchandise to other states and people can find hand-carts and cycle-carts carrying merchandise to be loaded on various buses. The Babughat has vantage advantage as the business and commercial hub of city BBD Bagh is near-by. For this reason Babughat is humming with people and activities throughout twenty-four hours of day and night. Further, Eden Gardens railway station of Kolkata Circular Railway is located just adjacent to Babughat and as such people commuting by train also get off and board trains from here.

It was first isolated in 1954 from the black mud of the San Francisco Bay Area by T.C. Stadtman, who also named the species. Cl. sticklandii is not pathogenic in humans. Biology and biochemistry Cl. sticklandii ferment amino acids by using the Stickland reaction, which couples the oxidation of one amino acid and the reduction of another. L.H. Stickland described this process in 1934. The enzymes in the Stickland reaction are D-proline reductase (an electron acceptor) and Glycine reductase. Cl. sticklandii preferentially utilize threonine, arginine, serine, cysteine, proline, and glycine during the growth phase and lysine during the stationary phase, while excreting glutamate, aspartate and alanine. Selenoproteins can be found in the genome of Cl. sticklandii. One such selenoprotein, glycine reductase A was first identified in Cl. sticklandii. C. sticklandii uses a total of eight of these selenoproteins. One of which, PrdC, was not previously thought to be a selenoprotein. PrdC, which is similar to RnfC in other species, is found within the D-proline reductase operon. The D-proline reductase operon is responsible for the reductive ring cleavage of D-proline into 5-aminovalerate. 5-aminovalerate is excreted by Cl. sticklandii. Although energy conservation in Cl. sticklandii is achieved through substrate level phosphorylation, it can be achieved via electron-transport phosphorylation as well. The Rnf complex, a Na+-dependent F-ATPase, V-ATPase, and a membrane-bound Pyrophosphatase serve as methods to conserve energy through electron-transport phosphorylation. On another interesting note, Cl. sticklandii have two carbon dioxide fixation pathways, Wood-Ljundgahl and Glycine synthase/glycine reductase pathways. It is an oddity to find both of these methods of carbon dioxide fixation simultaneously. Only four other bacterial species have been observed to contain both of these pathways. Although, Cl. sticklandii has the ability to utilize both pathways, it has not been determined if they do utilize both pathways at the same time. Genome Clostridium sticklandii has a genome that consists of one circular chromosome. On this chromosome are 2,715,461 base pairs. Of these base pairs there are 2573 coding sequences with only 2.1% of the genome repeated. Clostridium sticklandii shares the highest number of genes that are homologous with Clostridium difficile (a pathogenic species of Clostridia') and with two members of the genus Alkaliphilus. Although it is considered a obligate anaerobe, Cl. sticklandii has genes that allow for the bacterium to be cultivated in aerobic conditions. Some of the proteins made by Cl. sticklandii that allow for the repair of damage from oxygen exposure include Mn-superoxide dismutase and Superoxide reductase, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, rubrerythrin, Glutathione peroxidases, seleno-peroxiredoxin, thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase, and sulfoxide reductases A and B.

Scott Kelly with Santa Claus hat Christmas on the International Space Station covers the celebration of Christmas on the International Space Station. Christmas is celebrated each year by the International Space Station crew, their families, and ground-staff. Crew are given time off duty according to their respective culture, religion/faith and ethnicity. The Russian Orthodox Church celebrates Christmas according to the Julian calendar, whilst the Catholic Church and the various Protestant denominations use the Gregorian calendar so the crew may celebrate Christmas more than once on the station choosing between 25 December or 6, 7 or 19 January. Expedition 1 arrived on the ISS on 2 November 2000, celebrating their first Christmas on board the station later that year. Other celebrations included Expedition 30, with the arrival of Donald Pettit, Oleg Kononenko, and Andr√© Kuipers. The station has been continuously occupied since 2000, so every Christmas has been experienced by a crew. The holiday is popular enough that one of the traditions that has developed is having a Christmas dinner. On 25 December 2011 the crew of Expedition 30 took a break on Christmas to a take crew photo. This included Dan Burbank, Oleg Kononenko, Don Pettit, Anatoly Ivanishin, Andre Kuipers, and Anton Shkaplerov. On 24 December 2013, astronauts made a rare Christmas Eve extravehicular activity, installing a new ammonia pump for the station's cooling system. The faulty cooling system had failed earlier in the month, halting many of the station's science experiments. Astronauts had to brave a \\"mini blizzard\\" of noxious ammonia while installing the new pump. It was only the second Christmas Eve spacewalk in NASA history. On 25 December 2016 the crew celebrated Christmas by floating in micro-gravity and opening Christmas presents recently delivered on a Japanese cargo spacecraft. One astronaut wore a Santa hat in orbit. The French astronaut Thomas Pesquet shared special French food with station crew. Pesquet also made a Christmas-time special video for the ESA.

Wilson was born in Brisbane, and completed her initial training as a nurse in 1908. After the outbreak of World War I she joined the Australian Army Nursing Service (AANS) and subsequently transferred to the First Australian Imperial Force. From 1915 until 1919 she was the principal matron of the 3rd Australian General Hospital. She served as the temporary matron-in-chief in the AIF Headquarters, London from late 1917 until early 1918. Wilson returned to Australia in 1920 and left the AIF to work in civilian hospitals. She was appointed the matron-in-chief of the AANS in 1925, and in September 1940 joined the Second Australian Imperial Force. She served in the Middle East until August 1941, when she returned to Australia due to ill health. She left the Army the next month, but from September 1943 worked in the Department of Manpower Directorate (Victoria)'s nursing control section. Early life and World War I Grace Wilson was born in South Brisbane on 25 June 1879. She attended Brisbane Girls Grammar School, and began her training to become a nurse at Brisbane Hospital in 1905. She completed this qualification in 1908. During her period at Brisbane Hospital, Wilson became the first winner of the prestigious Gold Medal for nursing excellence.McCullagh (2010), p. 33 She subsequently travelled to London for training in midwifery at the Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital. Wilson subsequently worked at the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic in London. She arrived back in Australia during July 1914, and became the matron of Brisbane Hospital.McCarthy (1990) Wilson in her office at a hospital at Abbassia in Egypt during May 1916 Following the outbreak of World War I, Wilson joined the Army Nursing Service Reserve in October 1914 and became the principal matron of the 1st Military District. She enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 15 April 1915 and was appointed the 3rd Australian General Hospital's (3rd AGH) principal matron. She and the rest of the 3rd AGH departed Sydney bound for Europe on 15 May 1915. The 3rd AGH arrived in England at the end of June and was originally intended to be deployed to France. Instead, it was decided to send the hospital to Lemnos island in the Mediterranean to treat casualties of the Gallipoli Campaign. The 3rd AGH departed England in early July and arrived at Lemnos on 8 August. The ship carrying the nurses stopped at Alexandria during this voyage, where Wilson learned that one of her brothers had been killed at Quinn's Post in Gallipoli.Bassett (1997), pp. 44‚Äì46 Conditions at Lemnos were difficult, and there were initially few facilities to care for the many soldiers who were being evacuated there from Gallipoli. Wilson led efforts to improve the situation, earning praise from both her subordinates and superior officers.McCullagh (2010), pp. 33‚Äì35 In January 1916 the 3rd AGH moved to Abbassia in Egypt. Wilson was mentioned in despatches on three occasions during the year, and was awarded the Royal Red Cross in May. Wilson was also offered the post of Matron in Chief at AIF Headquarters in either late 1915 or early 1916, but turned it down as she wished to remain with the 3rd AGH.Bassett (1997), p. 53 In October 1916 the 3rd AGH was transferred to Brighton in England, and remained there until April 1917 when it moved to Abbeville in France. Wilson was temporarily appointed the Matron in Chief at the AIF Headquarters, London in September 1917 while Evelyn Conyers was on leave in Australia. She remained in this position until April the next year, and then rejoined the 3rd AGH.Reid (1990) Following the war, Wilson was mentioned in despatches again in December 1918, and was appointed to the Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) on 1 January 1919. The 3rd AGH was disbanded in May 1919, and Wilson was posted to England to serve in the 3rd Australian Auxiliary Hospital. She returned to Australia in January 1920 and formally ceased to be a member of the AIF in April of that year. Interbellum and World War II Wilson with other senior Australian Army medical staff in December 1939. Major General Downes is seated to Wilson's left. From November 1920 to 1922 Wilson was the matron of the Children's Hospital in Melbourne. During this appointment she sought to improve her nurses working conditions, and secured a minimum wage for trainees. In 1922 she resigned from the Children's Hospital and opened her own hospital in East Melbourne. She was appointed the matron-in-chief of the AANS (which was a part-time reserve position) in 1925, and received the Florence Nightingale Medal four years later. Wilson became the matron of The Alfred Hospital in January 1933. In this role she oversaw the first Commonwealth scheme for training nurse tutors.McCullagh (2010), p. 37 Wilson travelled again to London in 1937 to lead the AANS contingent at the ceremonies which marked the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Upon the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Wilson was called up to a full-time position in the Army and resigned from her position at The Alfred Hospital. She served on the staff of the Director-General of Medical Services, Major General Rupert Downes, in Army Headquarters as the Army's matron-in- chief.Walker (1962), p. 42 She became a member of the Second AIF in September 1940, and served in the Middle East as the matron-in-chief of its nursing service.Heywood (2002)Walker (1962), p. 325 Wilson remained in this position until May 1941, when she was forced to return to Australia due to health problems. She arrived back in Australia in August and left the AIF the next month.McCarthy (2002) Annie Sage replaced her as the AIF's matron-in-chief. Wilson was subsequently attached to the Australian Red Cross Society and oversaw an expansion of its activities. She was appointed the executive officer of the Department of Manpower Directorate (Victoria)'s nursing control section on 15 September 1943. In this role she controlled the staffing of all hospitals in the state of Victoria, and had a personal staff of four trained nurses and eleven office workers. Retirement Grace Wilson's medals on display at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra Wilson retired following the end of World War II, but continued to work on a voluntary basis for a number of organisations.McCullagh (2010), p. 38 These included the Royal Victorian Trained Nurses' Association, Royal Victorian College of Nursing, Australian Red Cross Society and the Girl Guides' Association. In addition, she worked as a trustee for the Shrine of Remembrance and the Edith Cavell Trust Fund. In 1953, Wilson became the first female life member of the Returned and Services League of Australia. Several nursing organisations also awarded her their highest honours. She married Robert Wallace Bruce Campbell in London on 12 January 1954. Wilson died at the Repatriation General Hospital at Heidelberg, Victoria on 12 January 1957. She was subsequently accorded a funeral with full military honours at Christ Church in South Yarra. Wilson's medals and uniform from World War I were placed on permanent display at the Australian War Memorial in 2014. Her World War I service was depicted in the 2014 television miniseries ANZAC Girls, in which actress Caroline Craig was cast as Wilson.

Although it can be considered an uncommon pathogen in humans, there has been substantial evidence of septic episodes in human beings. C. tertium is easily decolorized in Gram-stained smears and can be mistaken for a Gram-negative organism. However, C. tertium does not grow on selective media for Gram- negative organisms. History C. tertium was initially isolated from war wounds by Captain Herbert Henry (RAMC) in 1917, but it was not until the first human cases of C. tertium bacteremia were reported in 1963 that it was recognized as a human pathogen. C. tertium has been isolated in neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients, and in cases of necrotizing fasciitis and gangrene. It has also been recognized as a causative agent of enteritis in cattle, but it is an uncommon human pathogen. C. tertium has also been isolated from soil and from faeces of healthy neonates and infants. Characteristics Clostridium tertium is a Gram-positive, spore forming, anaerobic bacillus found in the soil and the gut of many animal species, including humans. C. tertium distinguishes itself from other clostridia as a non-toxin producing, aerotolerant, non-histotoxic and non-lipolytic species. Aerotolerant strains of anaerobic bacteria can tolerate oxygen and exhibit growth to some extent in the presence of oxygen. The aerotolerance of C. tertium can lead to its misidentification as Bacillus spp. or Lactobacillus spp. A negative catalase test is an easy tool to differentiate C. tertium from Bacillus spp., which are catalase positive. Also, C. tertium only forms spores anaerobically, as opposed to Bacillus spp., which sporulates aerobically. Other distinct characteristics are its large size (1.5 x 10 micrometers) and its unusual \\"square\\" morphology on Gram stained smear. Virulence C.tertium.Leifson flagella stain(digitally colorized) Clostridium tertium has traditionally been considered nonpathogenic, but increasingly it is being reported as a human pathogen. The organism has been associated with bacteremia, meningitis, septic arthritis, enterocolitis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, post-traumatic brain abscess, and pneumonia. It has also been increasingly recognized as an important cause of sepsis in immunocompromised patients. C. tertium has also been implicated with osteomyelitis, and miscellaneous soft tissue infections in humans. C. tertium does not appear to secrete any toxin; instead, it damages gastrointestinal mucosa by direct colonization. Three major factors have been associated with C. tertium bacteremia: intestinal mucosal injury, neutropenia, and history of exposure to Œ≤-lactam antibiotics (particularly third generation cephalosporins). Almost all reported cases of C. tertium bacteremia have been in neutropenic patients without any obvious source of infection. It has been established that C. tertium elaborates enzymes directed against blood group A antigen in the presence of glucosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, intact blood group substance with suboptimal glucose, or completely hydrolyzed blood group substance.Howe C., MacLennan JD, Mandl I, Kabat EA, (1957). \\"Enzymes of Clostridium tertium.\\" Department of Microbiology and Neurology\\" Columbia University. The blood group A-splitting activity of C. tertium enzymes was inhibited by copper, zinc and nickel ions. Treatment Clostridium tertium bacteremia can cause fever, and directed antibiotic therapy is indicated. C. tertium is commonly (but not universally) resistant to many Œ≤-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin and cephalosporin; clindamycin; and metronidazole; but it is susceptible to vancomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin. Mortality related to C. tertium bacteremia treated appropriately appears to be quite low. The selection effect of antibiotics on C. tertium may occur in cases where patients have had prior exposure to Œ≤-lactam antibiotics.

It was in use from 1914 until 1925, however it was closed for 8¬Ω of these 12 years due to World War I. History The Bristol and North Somerset Railway (B&NSR;) opened a branch line from to on 1 March 1882, although it had been funded by the Great Western Railway (GWR) which worked the trains on the line from the outset and purchased the B&NSR; Company in 1884. The line was extended from Camerton to in 1910 where it made a connection with the GWR's Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Line. There was no station between Hallatrow and Camerton until was opened at the same time as the line was opened through to Limpley Stoke, and on 5 January 1914 Paulton Halt itself was opened. The term 'halt' was used by the GWR to denote railway stations without staff or goods facilities. Passenger services had only been calling for a little over a year when, on 22 March 1915, they were withdrawn from the line due to the war. They were eventually restored on 9 July 1923, four and a half years after hostilities had ceased. They did not last long as they were withdrawn again on 21 September 1925, never to be resumed. Freight trains continued to operate through the station until 8 February 1932 and the track was lifted shortly afterwards. Description The stone-built platform was situated on the north side of the line, from Hallatrow at a place known as Gossard's Bridge; the Cam Brook was on the south side of the line opposite the platform. It was long, wide and high. Three oil lamps were provided and a plan suggests that a shelter was intended, but no photographic evidence of it exists. Access was by a footpath from the Paulton to High Littleton road that crossed the line at the east end of the station on a bridge. In 2010 a portion of the platform edge still stood, as did the access path and some railway fencing. Services Passenger trains on the Hallatrow to Limpley Stoke line were operated by steam railmotors or, later, by auto trains. In 1914 there were five trains each day, Monday to Saturday only. In 1923 this had been reduced to just four.

He was a member of the Wisconsin State Senate and a Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Sweet is also an important figure in the history of women's rights. The founding document he prepared for the town of Lombard, Illinois, stated that \\"all citizens\\" are entitled to vote. In 1891, Ellen A. Martin invoked that provision and voted, 29 years before women were empowered by an amendment to the Constitution to vote in the United States. His two daughters, Ada Celeste Sweet and Winifred Bonfils were also important figures in the history of the battle for women's rights. Biography Sweet was born Benjamin Jeffery Sweet on April 24, 1832, in New York City. He later moved to Chilton, Wisconsin. Sweet died on January 1, 1874, and is buried at Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago, Illinois. He had two noteworthy daughters: Ada Celeste Sweet was a social reformer and pioneer for women serving in government office; Winifred Bonfils (born Martha Winifred Sweet) was a journalist and humanitarian. Political career Sweet was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate. He later served as Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue of the United States from 1872 until his death. Military career Soon after the outbreak of the American Civil War, on July 16, 1861, Sweet joined the 6th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment of the Union Army and was given the rank of major.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 520. On September 17, 1861, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. On September 5, 1862, Sweet was promoted to colonel and given command of the 21st Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment. During the Battle of Perryville, in Kentucky, despite being sick from malaria, he led his men in combat until he was seriously wounded in his right arm. The wound ultimately left Sweet paralyzed in that arm for the rest of his life. Sweet resigned his commission on September 8, 1863. On September 25, 1863, Sweet was appointed a colonel in the Veteran Reserve Corps and assigned to the garrison at the Union Army prisoner-of-war camp for Confederate States Army soldiers at Camp Douglas, Chicago, Illinois. Following recuperation from his injury, Sweet was given command of Camp Douglas after Brigadier General William W. Orme resigned on May 2, 1864. At Camp Douglas, Sweet oversaw what some observers have called the unnecessarily harsh and cruel treatment of Confederate prisoners, but which other observers have seen as no less so than Confederate treatment of Union prisoners. This notwithstanding, Sweet would soon be lauded for \\"discovering\\" and \\"thwarting\\" a bogus plot by spies for the Confederacy to liberate Confederate prisoners of war and attack Chicago on the eve of the 1864 United States presidential election.Most historians now question the seriousness of the plot and even think it may have dissipated before Sweet made his efforts to stop the conspiracy and arrest conspirators.

Sweet's efforts to prevent the conspirators from achieving their objective earned him the thanks of the United States Department of War. On December 12, 1864, President Lincoln awarded Sweet the rank of brevet brigadier general of volunteers to rank from December 20, 1864, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on February 14, 1865.Eicher, 2001, p. 759 Sweet resigned from the army on September 19, 1865.

Written by co-creator Ryan Murphy and directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, the episode aired on Fox in the United States on January 31, 2012. It is a special tribute episode to Michael Jackson, and features eight of his songs as a solo artist, and one he sang as part of The Jackson 5. Reviews were widely varied for the episode: some felt it was the best of the third season to date, and others were quite critical, though the overall mix was somewhat more positive than negative. A number of reviewers noted that tribute episodes have tended to be light on plot, though several felt that this episode had surmounted the usual storyline problems that had plagued past tributes. The episode's musical performances were viewed more favorably, with many of the nine performances given high praise, including \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', \\"Human Nature\\", \\"Smooth Criminal\\", and \\"Scream\\", the last of these primarily for Kevin McHale's dancing. Five of the songs‚Äîthe first three above plus \\"Bad\\" and \\"Black or White\\"‚Äîcharted on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Canadian Hot 100, while the other four were also released as singles but did not chart.

Blaine (Darren Criss) performs \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' to demonstrate his suggested number. However, he mentions this possibility to Sebastian Smythe (Grant Gustin), the new captain of the Dalton Academy Warblers and a Regionals competitor, and Sebastian later announces that the Warblers, who will be performing first, will also be doing Jackson's music. New Directions challenges the Warblers for the right to perform Jackson, and they meet in a parking garage at night and compete to \\"Bad\\". At the end of the number, Sebastian throws a slushie at Kurt (Chris Colfer) but Blaine interposes himself: he is hit in the face and badly injured. Finn (Cory Monteith) asks Rachel (Lea Michele) for her answer to his proposal since he has waited the three days she requested, but she is not ready, so he agrees to wait longer. Rachel asks Quinn (Dianna Agron) for advice, and Quinn advises her to refuse and leave her past behind. Quinn has done so, and she has been accepted at Yale; she sings \\"Never Can Say Goodbye\\" to former boyfriends Puck (Mark Salling), Finn and Sam (Chord Overstreet), and to the glee club. Sam calls Mercedes to the auditorium and asks her to sing with him‚Äîthey have never duetted in glee club. She refuses and starts to leave, but he begins \\"Human Nature\\" and she joins in. Afterward, they kiss. Blaine's cornea was deeply scratched in the incident and he needs surgery. The club wants revenge on Sebastian; Kurt says he should be expelled from Dalton, but Will asks them to let the system handle it. Artie (Kevin McHale) refuses: he is fed up with being told it will get better and says it should be better now, and leaves. Despite wanting revenge, Kurt is unwilling to use violence, so Santana goes to Dalton and accuses Sebastian of lying about the composition of the damaging slushie. He challenges her to a duel: the song \\"Smooth Criminal\\". He admits after they finish that he rigged the slushie with rock salt, and hits her with an unadulterated one. Santana secretly recorded the encounter, and plays her evidence to New Directions, who in turn invite the Warblers to their auditorium, show them that they \\"get\\" Jackson better by performing \\"Black or White\\", and reveal to the Warblers the proof that Sebastian deliberately tried to injure one of them. Kurt's father Burt (Mike O'Malley) takes Kurt out of class to hand him his letter from NYADA. Kurt opens it and discovers to his elation he is a finalist for admission; Burt is overcome with pride. Kurt tells Rachel, only to discover that she has not received any letter from the school; Rachel dissolves in tears. Finn later sings \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" to Rachel, and she tells him she loves him and that she accepts his proposal. She ultimately does get a finalist letter from NYADA and tells Kurt, to his joy, but she has not yet told Finn. Production Glee co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk had wanted to a tribute episode to Michael Jackson (pictured) since the show's first season Executive producers Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk had been mentioning since before the second season ended that they were planning another big tribute episode that they had been wanting to do since the first season, but would not reveal the name of the artist. On December 6, 2011, the same day that they were airing the \\"Hold On to Sixteen\\" episode that featured three Jackson family songs, Murphy announced that they had finally obtained the rights to do a Michael Jackson tribute episode. The episode was written by Murphy and directed by Alfonso Gomez- Rejon, who had most recently directed Asian F. Filming had begun by December 12, 2011, and was interrupted by a two-week holiday vacation. Both of the last two shooting days before the vacation began, December 15 and 16, ran a couple of hours past midnight, with the final night not ending until three in the morning. Filming had not yet completed when the twelfth episode, with guest star Ricky Martin, began filming on January 5, 2012, the third day after the holiday vacation ended. The two episodes continued in parallel until the final Michael Jackson number was shot on January 13, 2012, over a month after filming began and the same day that the thirteenth episode commenced filming. It had been announced late in the summer that Darren Criss, who plays Blaine Anderson, would be starring on Broadway in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying from January 3 through 22, 2012, with rehearsals beginning there a couple of weeks before his debut. At the time, the reports said he would be missing \\"an episode and a half of Glee\\". The final scene filmed before the holiday break was the first song in the episode, for which Criss sang lead, and he filmed several scenes in the episode in those last four days. He is singing lead on the song \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin. Criss spent five weeks in New York City, the last three starring in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying from January 3 through 22, 2012. The performance of \\"Smooth Criminal\\" featured the instrumental duo 2Cellos (Stjepan Hauser, left, and Luka ≈†uliƒá, right) The Dalton Academy Warblers return in this episode, and perform \\"Bad\\" with New Directions, which was shot on location in a \\"parking garage just outside the Paramount Studio gates\\". On the previous day, several members of New Directions did their first location shoots in the building used for Dalton Academy. The Warblers shot their own number, \\"I Want You Back\\" by The Jackson 5 with Gustin on lead vocal, but the song was omitted from the final cut of the episode. This was the second time in the third season that ten musical performances were shot for an episode but only nine were ultimately included: Rivera's rendition of \\"Santa Baby\\" was cut from the episode two before this one, \\"Extraordinary Merry Christmas\\". \\"I Want You Back\\", like \\"Santa Baby\\" before it, was nevertheless released as a single, and on August 3, 2012, Murphy released the originally filmed scene including it uploaded to his YouTube page. The Warblers number had already run into difficulties earlier in production: it was originally planned to be Jackson's \\"Rock with You\\", but there were problems clearing the rights, so \\"I Want You Back\\" was selected and filmed instead. Gustin and Rivera performed \\"Smooth Criminal\\" with on-screen musical guests 2Cellos, Luka ≈†uliƒá and Stjepan Hauser, who became famous when their instrument-only two-cello cover of the piece received over three million views on YouTube in its first two weeks. The arrangement used for the performance is based on the 2Cellos version. The remaining six songs that are covered in the episode include \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\", performed by Michele and Monteith; The Jackson 5's \\"Never Can Say Goodbye\\", sung by Agron; \\"Ben\\" sung by Colfer, Michele and Monteith; \\"Black or White\\" featuring Riley, Rivera, Michele, McHale and Colfer; \\"Human Nature\\" sung by Riley and Overstreet; and the Michael and Janet Jackson song \\"Scream\\", performed by McHale and Harry Shum, Jr. \\"Human Nature\\" was originally reported as being part of a mash-up with Nat King Cole's \\"Nature Boy\\", but the song as performed is the Jackson song alone. All ten songs recorded‚Äîthe nine in the episode plus \\"I Want You Back\\" which was ultimately cut‚Äîhave been released as singles, available for download. Recurring guest stars in the episode include Kurt's father Burt Hummel (O'Malley), glee club members Sam Evans (Overstreet) and Rory Flanagan (Damian McGinty), and Dalton Academy Warbler Sebastian Smythe (Gustin). Reception Ratings \\"Michael\\" was first broadcast on January 31, 2012 in the United States on Fox. It received a 3.7/10 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and attracted 9.07 million American viewers during its initial airing, an increase of over 20% from the 3.1/8 rating/share and 7.50 million viewers of the previous episode, \\"Yes/No\\", which was broadcast on January 17, 2012. In Canada, 1.84 million viewers watched the episode on the same day as its American premiere. It was the tenth most-viewed show of the week, up two slots and 14% from the 1.61 million viewers who watched \\"Yes/No\\" two weeks earlier.Canadian viewership data: *\\"Michael\\": *\\"Yes/No\\": In the United Kingdom, \\"Michael\\" first aired on March 8, 2012, and was watched on Sky 1 by 682,000 viewers. Viewership was down over 15% from \\"Yes/No\\", which attracted 805,000 viewers when it aired the week before.UK viewership data: *\\"Michael\\": *\\"Yes/No\\": In Australia, \\"Michael\\" was broadcast on February 24, 2012. It was watched by 535,000 viewers, which made Glee the thirteenth most-watched program of the night, down from eleventh the week before. The viewership was down nearly 4% from the previous episode, \\"Yes/No\\", which was seen by 556,000 viewers.Australian viewership data: *\\"Michael\\": *\\"Yes/No\\": Critical reception The episode was given a widely varied reception by reviewers, ranging from Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone, who called it \\"season three's best episode so far\\", to BuddyTV John Kubicek, who described the episode as \\"just plain silly and ridiculous\\", though the overall mix was somewhat more positive than negative. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal wrote that \\"the episode was well paced, well sung and well danced\\", though he was unhappy with the concluding number, and Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch said the episode \\"contained some of this season's best dramatic and musical performances\\". Crystal Bell of HuffPost TV stated that she was \\"a little underwhelmed\\" by the episode, which \\"never quite lived up to the greatness that is Michael Jackson\\". IGN's Robert Canning gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8 out of 10, and characterized it as \\"more than just a theme episode\\" in which he was \\"connecting to characters\\" that had not \\"grabbed\\" him since the first season. MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan summarized the episode as follows: \\"When all was said and done, it was another tribute episode, something that can't be uttered by a Glee fan without a sigh and an eye roll.\\" Bell noted that tribute episodes usually mean that \\"all sense of plot continuity\\" is forgone, but that this one ranked \\"at the top of all of the other Glee tribute episodes because even though it was absurd at times, at least there was a plot‚Äîand it kind of made sense\\". Futterman was more complimentary and described it as the \\"most effortless tribute episode yet\\", and Canning wrote that \\"with songs we know and love and storylines that actually connected and delivered some meaningful and moving moments\\" it was \\"more than just a theme episode\\". Jen Chaney of The Washington Post, however, thought that it was very much like previous tributes in that it also \\"featured scattered plot lines engineered to include as many songs by said artists as possible\\" and also \\"glorified their respective pop stars‚Äô images to an absurd degree\\". The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff also noted the glorification of Jackson, and noted \\"every time the show turns into an episode about Michael Jackson, it stops dead in its tracks entirely\\". She stated that what was \\"weird\\" about the episode was that \\"what didn‚Äôt work was the spectacle, while what did work were the smaller, character-based stories\\" which \\"provided a spine some of the other spectacle-oriented episodes have lacked\\". Futterman was one of many reviewers who took note of a new feature of this tribute episode when she commented on the \\"initial whiff of product placement and forced timing\\" related to the \\"Immortal World Tour\\" dialogue. Rae Votta of Billboard thought the inclusion a \\"brilliant bit of marketing synergy\\", but TVLine Michael Slezak called it \\"ridiculously unsubtle product-placement\\". The scene where Rachel (Michele, pictured) \\"breaks down in front of Kurt\\" was praised by critics. Although Rachel's decision to accept Finn's proposal of marriage was greeted with skepticism, Canning spoke for many when he stated that her \\"arc in the episode was her best in a while\\" with \\"some compelling moments\\". He also cited the \\"fantastically true advice\\" from Quinn, and VanDerWerff thought the scene \\"was going along great until the last 10 seconds\\" of that advice. Bell praised as \\"believable\\" the scene where Rachel \\"breaks down in front of Kurt\\", and Slezak said he \\"loved that scene of Kurt holding his sobbing friend in front of the lockers\\". Kurt's scene with his father was Bell's \\"favorite scene\\" which she said was \\"an incredibly touching moment between father and son. It was perfect.\\" Flandez also called Burt \\"perfect\\" for \\"delivering the NYADA envelope to his son\\", and The Hollywood Reporter Lesley Goldberg described his scene as \\"another great Burt gem\\". Kubicek characterized the fact that Sebastian was not arrested for injuring Blaine as \\"an absurd plot twist\\". He criticized Kurt for withholding the evidence and wrote, \\"Santana's plan isn't vicious or mean, it's getting justice. Sebastian committed a crime and he should pay for it.\\" Slezak thought the decision as to whether the police would be given Santana's evidence should have been Blaine's to make, and Lynch posited that \\"a talk with the police\\" might teach Sebastian \\"that violent actions have legal consequences\\". Chaney was incredulous at Will's statements to the glee club on the matter, especially, \\"Unless you have proof that he tampered with the slushie, the police aren‚Äôt getting involved.\\" Kubicek called Artie's anger that led to \\"Scream\\" a story arc that \\"goes nowhere and was just a poorly written excuse to do that song\\", but Votta was impressed that \\"we learn more about Artie's frustration in this fantasy scene than we have in 3 seasons\\". Canning wrote that \\"as extraneous as the extended \\"Scream\\" segment was, the build up to that moment was perfect\\". Music and performances The \\"slick showmanship\\" of Blaine (pictured) made him a \\"natural for lead vocals\\" on \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'. The episode's musical performances were given a better reception than the episode as a whole, though there were some dissenting voices, and not every song was received with the same enthusiasm. Slezak described the episode as \\"jam-packed with terrific song-and-dance numbers\\", and Votta wrote that \\"the musical numbers themselves were strong, fantastical and poignant to the story\\". Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times declared, \\"The music was good; the dancing, better.\\" Chaney wrote that \\"too many\\" of the musical numbers were \\"weak imitations\\", which was reflected in her grading: her median grade for the nine numbers was a \\"C+\\", and her highest grade was a single \\"B+\\". The first song was \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin, which Bell said \\"was a fun homage to Michael Jackson, and it set the tone for the rest of the episode\\". Futterman said that Blaine's \\"slick showmanship\\" made him a \\"natural for lead vocals\\", and Slezak called it \\"the best use of Darren Criss' voice on Glee in quite some time\\" and gave it an \\"A‚àí\\". Lynch also gave it an \\"A‚àí\\", and said Criss \\"captured the excitement and the spunky bravado of the original\\". Sullivan was another fan of \\"the sheer awesomeness of Darren Criss\\" on the song, and characterized it as \\"a tribute that's more respectful than any other in the episode\\". Chaney dissented from the general approval; she gave it a \\"C+\\" and wrote that \\"the number was appropriately big and splashy, but musically, it sounded like all the funk had been drained right out of it\\". She described \\"Bad\\" similarly as she gave it a \\"C‚àí\\": \\"this tune also sounded noticeably defunkified\\". Sullivan was also unimpressed; he wrote that the performance let \\"the world know what 'Bad' sounds like after it's drained of every ounce of danger\\". Lynch gave it a \\"B\\" and wrote that \\"as silly as a choreographed gang fight between teenagers in a parking lot sounds (and was), the choreography was crisp and the attitude was a lot of fun\\". Slezak also praised the fight choreography, and stated that he \\"got chills\\" when Santana sang the chorus, and gave the song a \\"B+\\". Futterman noted the \\"interesting twist\\" in the song's arrangement \\"thanks to the Warblers' penchant for a cappella\\", and said that \\"Artie and Santana\\" began their battle for \\"vocal MVP of the episode\\" with \\"Bad\\". Votta described the number as \\"up there with the Dreamgirls performance from earlier this season as one of the strangest and best things Glee has done\\". Several reviewers regretted that Kevin McHale (pictured) could not dance more often on the show. Kevin McHale's performance as Artie in \\"Scream\\" inspired several reviewers, including Kate Stanhope of TV Guide and Bell, to write of their regret that McHale could not dance more often on the show. Reiter called him \\"a sorely underused Glee resource\\" and called the number \\"the best dance moment\\" of the episode, and Bell declared, \\"I have one word for this number: Epic.\\" Flandez called it a \\"phenomenal job\\", and Stanhope cited \\"killer performances\\" by McHale on this number and others as evidence that with Artie only a junior \\"there is life\\" in New Directions after McKinley's current seniors graduate. Lynch called the number \\"awesome\\" and gave it an \\"A+\\", and Goldberg described it as \\"a perfect example of what the show looks like when it's firing on all cylinders\\"; both reviewers praised the dancing of both performers. Chaney wrote that the performance \\"lacked the energy and genuine aggression of the original Michael/Janet Jackson collaboration, although at least Kevin McHale and Harry Shum Jr. got to show off their dance skills\\", and gave it a \\"C\\". She felt that \\"Never Can Say Goodbye\\", to which she gave a \\"B‚àí\\", \\"worked much better than every track that preceded it\\" because it adapted the song to the show \\"instead of trying to out-Jackson Jackson\\". Lynch called it \\"a nice summation of her character's journey, but not vocally impressive enough to justify listening to outside of the episode\\" and gave it a \\"B\\". Bell described it as a \\"blah performance\\", but Stanhope said it was \\"sweet and reflective\\". Futterman wrote that it was \\"a tune well-suited for Quinn's sultry voice and the flipped meaning she gives the lyrics\\", and Slezak had a similar take: he gave it an \\"A\\" and called it a \\"remarkably lovely fit\\" for her voice. Votta and Futterman both said that Sam and Mercedes sounded \\"great together\\" on \\"Human Nature\\", and Futterman also complimented their individual voices‚Äî\\"hers restrained and soulful, his rock- tinged and raw\\"‚Äîand summarized, \\"It's a crisp, well-executed cover\\". Most other reviewers also noted how good their voices sounded together, including Chaney, who gave the song a \\"B‚àí\\", and Bell, who called their harmonies \\"out- of-this-world amazing\\". Lynch and Slezak each praised the tenderness in Riley's vocals; Lynch gave the song an \\"A\\", and Slezak an \\"A‚àí\\". \\"Ben\\", however, received far more mixed commentary, and several reviewers felt it was odd to, as Chaney put it, sing a song about a rat \\"to a guy who isn't named Ben and was wearing an eye patch\\", which Futterman called \\"a little creepy\\" and VanDerWerff, more bluntly, \\"fucking weird\\". Despite this, Chaney gave the song a \\"B\\", one of her highest grades of the night, in part because it gave Colfer \\"an excuse to hit those 'You‚Äôve got a friend in me' high notes\\", while Futterman noted that he \\"does well in the high range\\", and praised the verses by Rachel and Finn. Bell, however, called the song \\"a snooze-fest\\", and Slezak was very unhappy with the \\"interminable rendition\\" which he graded a \\"D\\". In December 2012, TV Guide listed the rendition as one of Glee worst performances. \\"Smooth Criminal\\" was the most highly praised number of the night. Both Slezak and Lynch gave it an \\"A+\\": the former called it \\"an instant Glee classic\\" that \\"had me on the edge of my musical chair from start to finish\\", and Lynch wrote, \\"Santana declared herself the winner, but the actual victors were 2Cellos, the real-life Croatian cellists whose manic intensity stole the scene.\\" Slezak was similarly impressed by 2Cellos‚Äî\\"this was really a duet between Santana and those amazing black cellos\\"‚Äîand Futterman called them \\"furiously awesome\\" and said of the song, \\"It's the perfect soundtrack for the show's slickest villains: Santana wails, Sebastian channels his Chuck Bass and we are sold.\\" Bell described it as \\"easily one of the best performances of the night\\" and added \\"Santana was flawless\\". Chaney dissented from the acclaim with a \\"D\\" grade. Slezak described the duet of \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" as \\"really pretty\\", and Chaney said that \\"Lea Michele ... sang this Jackson love song in the loveliest possible fashion with Cory Monteith\\". Votta wrote that \\"Finn sounds the best he's sounded\\", and Futterman noted that Finn held \\"his own against Rachel, vocally\\"‚Äîshe liked the fact that it was Finn singing to Rachel instead of the usual other way around and was \\"grateful to the Glee team for assigning plot-relevant songs\\". Lynch felt that the song \\"seemed to slow down the otherwise wonderfully paced episode\\" and would have preferred it if they had cut the song and \\"kept the Warblers' version of 'I Want You Back' instead\\". He was more enthusiastic about \\"Black or White\\", which he characterized as \\"musically awesome but dramatically confusing\\" and graded an \\"A‚àí\\". Futterman said that \\"Artie once again nails the MJ impression\\", and Goldberg declared that the \\"chorus with Santana leading charge and Artie's rap\\" were \\"spot on\\". Bell agreed that the song showed that \\"Artie is still New Directions' go-to rapper\\", but noted that she did not feel that New Directions had successfully demonstrated that they \\"knew the true meaning of Michael Jackson\\". Chaney was unenthusiastic and gave the song a \\"C\\", while Flandez had more negative opinion than hers: \\"Sebastian Smythe got our reaction right: a slow-handed clap\\". Chart history Of the nine cover versions of Michael Jackson's music, all of which were released as singles, five debuted on US and Canadian top 100 charts, and ranked in the same order in both countries. \\"Smooth Criminal\\" debuted in the US at number twenty-six on the Billboard Hot 100, with sales of 108,000; only nine songs sold more digital downloads that week. \\"Human Nature\\" debuted at number fifty-six, \\"Black or White\\" at number sixty-four, \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin at number seventy-eight and \\"Bad\\" at number eighty.Peak chart positions for season 3 singles in the United States: \\"Smooth Criminal\\", \\"Human Nature\\", \\"Black or White\\", \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin and \\"Bad\\" \\"Smooth Criminal entered the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 chart at number twenty-eight, and was followed by \\"Human Nature\\" at number sixty-two, \\"Black or White\\" at number sixty-nine, \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin at number eighty-eight and \\"Bad\\" at number ninety.

He was a Korean Buddhist Seon (Zen) Master who in the first half of the 19th century introduced the Way of Tea (tea ceremony) and the practices of Buddhism to many aristocratic scholars who were dissatisfied with the rigid neo-Confucianism of the Joseon era. He was himself noted as a calligrapher and artist, as well as a poet, and he formed deep friendships with other famous figures of his time, especially Jeong Yak-yong and Kim Jeong-hui. Life and career Early life He was born on the 5th day of the 4th lunar month, 1786, in Singi village, Samhyang District, Muan County, in what is now known as South Jeolla Province. His family name was Jang Âºµ, his original name as a monk was Uisun ÊÑèÊ¥µ (later he wrote it as ÊÑèÊÅÇ). In his 16th year he became a monk at Unheung-sa Temple Èõ≤ËààÂØ∫ on the slopes of Deokyong-san Mountain in Dado District, Naju County, South Jeolla Province, under the Venerable Byeokbong Minseong Á¢ßÂ≥∞ ÊïèÊÄß. In his 19th year, after an enlightenment experience on Wolchul-san Mountain in Yeong‚Äôam, he received ordination from his main master, the Seon (Zen) master Wanho Yunu Áé©Ëôé ÂÄ´‰Ωë at the temple of Daedun-sa Â§ßËäöÂØ∫ (now known as Daeheung-sa Â§ßËààÂØ∫), receiving the name Cho-ui. In addition to scholarly learning, Cho-ui was a skilled painter in both scholarly and Buddhist styles, and a noted performer of Beompae Ê¢µË≤ù Buddhist ritual song and dance.Korean Tea Classics ed./trans. Brother Anthony of Taiz√©, Hong Keong- Hee, Steven D. Owyoung. Seoul: Seoul Selection. 2010. Page 59. Relationship with Jeong Yak-yong In 1806, he may first have met Dasan Jeong Yak-yong Ëå∂Â±± ‰∏ÅËã•Èèû (1763-1836) who was living in exile in his mother‚Äôs native country of Gangjin, only seven or eight miles away from Daedun-sa, and Dasan‚Äôs tea companion, the Venerable A‚Äôam Hyejang ÂÖíÂ∫µ ÊÉ†Ëóè, the head monk of the nearby Baegnyeon-sa Temple ÁôΩËìÆÂØ∫. In 1809, he spent several months in Gangjin, learning the I Ching ÊòìÁ∂ì (Book of Changes) and classical Chinese poetry from Dasan. They became very close, despite Dasan being socially superior and a Confucian scholar who had been deeply influenced by the Seohak Ë•øÂ≠∏ western learning that included Catholicism. Usually such men had little or no sympathy with Buddhism. It is a testimony to Choui‚Äôs qualities as a scholar that he won the admiration of Jeong Yak-Yong and other literati.Korean Tea Classics ed./trans. Brother Anthony of Taiz√©, Hong Keong-Hee, Steven D. Owyoung. Seoul: Seoul Selection. 2010. Page 60. Meeting with famous scholars in Seoul Cho-ui seems first to have visited Seoul in 1815, but it was during a visit late in 1830 that he became widely recognized and established strong relationships with a number of highly educated scholar-officials, several of whom had been to China, who became his friends and followers. These included the son-in-law of King Jeongjo Ê≠£Á•ñ (r 1776- 1800), Haegeo-doin Hong Hyeon-Ju Êµ∑Â±Ö ÈÅì‰∫∫ Ê¥™È°ØÂë® (1793-1865) and his brother Yeoncheon Hong Seok- Ju Ê∑µÊ≥â Ê¥™Â•≠Âë® (1774-1842), the son of Dasan, Unpo Jeong Hak-Yu ËÄò ÈÄã ‰∏ÅÂ≠∏Ê∏∏ (1786-1855), as well as the famous calligrapher Chusa Kim Jeong-hui ÁßãÂè≤ ÈáëÊ≠£Âñú (1786-1856) with his brothers Sanchon Kim Myeong-Hui Â±±Ê≥â ÈáëÂëΩÂñú (1788-1857) and Geummi Kim Sang-Hu Áê¥Á≥ú ÈáëÁõ∏Âñú (1794-1861). It was most unusual for a Buddhist monk, who as such was assigned the lowest rank in society, together with mudangs Â∑´Â†Ç (shaman) and kisaengs Â¶ìÁîü, to be recognized as a poet and thinker in this way by members of the Confucian establishment. As a monk, Cho-ui was not allowed to enter the city walls of Seoul and had to receive visits from these scholars while living in Cheongnyangsa temple Ê∑∏Ê∂ºÂØ∫ outside the capital‚Äôs eastern gate or in a hermitage in the hills to the north.Korean Tea Classics ed./trans. Brother Anthony of Taiz√©, Hong Keong-Hee, Steven D. Owyoung. Seoul: Seoul Selection. 2010. Page 61. Life in Ilchi-am Once he was in his forties, he withdrew to the mountain above Daedun-sa, in the far south-west region of Korea, built a hermitage known as Ilchi-am ‰∏ÄÊûùÂ∫µ in 1824, and lived there alone for the next forty years, practicing meditation in a manner he developed and wrote about, provoking a methodological dispute that lasted long after his death. Practice of and writings about Seon meditation In the late Joseon period, Korean meditation practice was generally limited to the practice of samatha. Cho-ui‚Äôs method was known as Chigwan Ê≠¢ËßÄ ‚Äústopping and seeing‚Äù, a dichotomy of two concepts: samatha and vipa≈õyanƒÅ, concentration and insight. Samatha, often translated as ‚Äúcalm abiding‚Äù, comprised a style of practices promoting concentration, culminating in a tranquil awareness that can be effortlessly sustained for hours on end. Vipa≈õyanƒÅ was the ensuing practice of insight into the nature of illusion and reality. Thus, samatha was a focusing, strengthening and pacifying concentration used in preparation for vipa≈õyanƒÅ to enhance the revelatory work of insight.Korean Tea Classics ed./trans. Brother Anthony of Taiz√©, Hong Keong-Hee, Steven D. Owyoung. Seoul: Seoul Selection. 2010. Page 63. Cho-ui composed a treatise, Seonmun sapyeonmaneo (Á¶™ÈñÄÂõõËæØÊº´Ë™û Four Defenses and Random Words), to warn monks of a crucial dimension of insight missing from their practice. In the treatise, Choui criticized the contemporary meditation master Baekpa Geungseon ÁôΩÂù° ‰∫òÁíá (1767-1852) who wrote the Seonmun sugyeong Á¶™ÊñáÊâãÈè° Hand Glass of Seon Literature.http://www.koreanbuddhism.net/master/priest_view.asp?cat_seq=10&priest;_seq=3&page;=1 Writings about tea In 1828, during a visit to Chilbul-am Hermitage ‰∏É‰ΩõÂ∫µ in Jirisan Mountain, Cho-ui transcribed a Ming Dynasty Chinese text on tea. Two years later on his return to Ilchi-am, he produced the ChaSinJeon (or Dasinjeon) (Ëå∂Á•ûÂÇ≥ Chronicle of the Spirit of Tea) as a simple guide to the basic principles involved in making and drinking tea. In 1830, he published a now lost collection of his own poems with prefaces and postscripts by four leading scholar-administrators in which they show their personal interest in Seon Á¶™ Zen practice and the drinking of tea. He then returned to his hermitage, where he wrote and painted. In 1837, he composed the DongChaSong (or DongDaSong) (Êù±Ëå∂È†å Hymn in Praise of Korean Tea), at the request of Hong Hyeon-Ju. This is the work for which he is most celebrated among lovers of tea in Korea.Korean Tea Classics ed./trans. Brother Anthony of Taiz√©, Hong Keong-Hee, Steven D. Owyoung. Seoul: Seoul Selection. 2010. Page 64. In 1838, he climbed to the topmost peak of Mount Kumgang, Biro Peak, before visiting the hills around Seoul. In his fifty-fifth year, he received the title Daegakdeunggyebojejonja Cho-ui DaeJongSa (Â§ßË¶∫ÁôªÈöéÊôÆÊøüÂ∞äËÄÖ ËçâË°£ Â§ßÂÆó Â∏´ the Great Monk Cho-ui, Master of Supreme Enlightenment), from King Heonjong ÊÜ≤ÂÆó (r 1834-1849). In his 58th year he visited his childhood home and saw his parents‚Äô graves covered with weeds, an evocative event he marked in a poem. Visits to Kim Jeong-hui in exile From 1840 until 1848, Chusa Kim Jeong-hui was exiled to the southern island of Cheju and during those years, Cho-ui visited him no less than five times, once staying for six months, teaching him about tea and Buddhism. When Chusa was freed, he visited Choui at Ilchi-am as soon as he arrived on the mainland on his way back to Seoul.

The interconnect consists of: * a lip flange on the ends of pipes with a grooved indentation on the flange. * a polymer sealing gasket placed between sections of pipe, squeezed between the flanges. This ring has a raised groove on both sides mating with the indentations of the two pipes on either side. * an enclosing clamp with C-shape clamping sections that cover the outer circumference of the flanges, applying pressure to squeeze the two pipe sections together onto the sealing ring. The clamp also provides structural strength and rigidity to the pipe sections. The combined lip flange and gasket do not impede the flow of fluids through the piping.

Life and career Michael von Gr√ºnau was born in Germany, the son of Viktoria Hanke and Werner von Gr√ºnau. His father was a translator and a writer; his mother was a housewife and a writing assistant for her husband. von Gr√ºnau grew up in West Germany, but emigrated to Canada in about 1965 to study Physics at University of Toronto. He graduated in 1968, but then commenced a MA in Psychology, graduating in 1971, and a PhD, graduating in 1975. His PhD was supervised by Paul Kolers. Around this time, he conducted research into the Color Phi phenomenon, investigating the influence of color on apparent movement from stationary images and also the fluttering heart phenomenon in which a red patch on a blue background appears to jump around as an observer moves his or her eyes. In the early 1980s von Gr√ºnau moved to the Department of Psychology at Queen's University at Kingston, where he founded a neurophysiology laboratory to study the visual system of cats. He continued his psychophysical studies of human visual perception. In about 1987, von Gr√ºnau spent about 18 months as a postdoctoral fellow at the National Research Council (Canada) in the Division of Physics, under the supervision of Bill Cowan. He worked mainly with Patrick Cavanagh. In 1989, von Gr√ºnau moved to the Department of Psychology at Concordia University in Montreal. There he worked mainly in the psychophysics of human visual perception, on phenomena surrounding higher- order motion aftereffects, visual search and attention in the real world, visual flow fields, and eye movements. In 1991, von Gr√ºnau married Marinez de Andrade. They adopted a son, Fernando in 1999, from Brazil, and a daughter, Gabriela, in 2002, from China. von Gr√ºnau died on 22 December 2011, from cancer.

Her father, a character actor known for his portrayal of butlers and priests, was born in Glasgow with the surname Macpherson. Findlay was raised in New York City where she attended private schools and first appeared on stage at around the age of 12 in Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch and later Baby Mine at Daly‚Äôs Theatre.The Moving Picture World, Volume 27, 1916; pg. 392 Her first major role came a few years later in a road production of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm and in 1917 she found success playing Marguerite in A Successful Calamity at Broadway‚Äôs Booth Theatre.

Arpalik was a kind of appanage given to members of the Ottoman elite for tax farming.  Etymology  The barleycorn was known as arpa in Turkish, and the feudal system in Ottoman Empire employed the term arpalik, or \\"barley-money\\", to refer to a second allowance made to officials to offset the costs of fodder for their horses (for covering the expenses of keeping a small unit of cavalry).  History  The number of viziers was steadily increasing in the Ottoman Empire since 16th century. Many of them were not satisfied with the income they received so the institution of arpalik was introduced. The rank of the people who were given arpalik was often higher than rank of the regular governor of the whole district. The institution of arpalik was introduced to make burden of government officials easier by compensating losses of its high officials. Instead to resolve Porte's problems, the institutions of arpalik introduced new, even bigger ones. The exact duties of the araplik holders were never precisely defined by the Ottoman government which caused frequent tensions between the Porte and the province. This tensions probably additionally contributed to the decay of the traditional timar system because it left sipahi out of the clear chain of command. Initially, in the sixteenth century, the number of sancaks given as arpalik was very small. After the decay of timar system many sancaks in Anatolia were given as arpaliks to the high Ottoman officials.

(1991), ‚ÄòExploration and exploitation in organizational learning‚Äô. Organization Science, vol. 2, 71‚Äì87.Levinthal, D.A. and March, J.G. (1993), ‚ÄòThe myopia of learning‚Äô. Strategic Management Journal, vol. 14, 95‚Äì112. Overview The success trap arises when a firm overemphasizes exploitation investments, even if explorative investments are required for successful adaptation. Exploitation draws on processes that serve to incrementally improve existing knowledge, while exploration involves the pursuit and acquisition of new knowledge. Firms and other organizations that have been performing well over an extended period of time are exposed to strong path dependence in exploitative activities, at the cost of explorative activities with which they have little experience. For example, in the 1990s Polaroid‚Äôs management failed to respond to the transition from analogue to digital photography, although the rise of digital technology had been evident since the 1980s.Tripsas, M. and Gavetti, G. (2000), ‚ÄòCapabilities, cognition, and inertia: evidence from digital imaging‚Äô. Strategic Management Journal, vol. 21, 1147‚Äì61. Other well-known examples of companies that got caught in the success trap include Kodak, Rubbermaid and Caterpillar.Adams, M. and Boike, D. (2004), ‚ÄòThe PDMA foundation 2004 comparative performance assessment study‚Äô. Visions, 28, 26‚Äì9.Helfat, C.E., Finkelstein, S., Mitchell, W., Peteraf, M., Singh, H., Teece, D. and Winter, S.G. (2007), Dynamic Capabilities: Understanding Strategic Change in Organizations. Oxford: Blackwell. Conditions giving rise to success trap A key condition giving rise to a firm getting caught in the success trap is the company culture, having been created based on the understanding of what makes success, the culture then solidifies. When the environment changes there is an initial dismissing of the significance of the change and the (over time) subsequent failure to adjust the strategy of the firm.Nystrom, P.C. and Starbuck, W.H. (1988), ‚ÄòTo avoid organizational crises, unlearn‚Äô. In: Cameron, K.S., Sutton, R.I. and Whetten, D.A. (Eds.), Readings in Organizational Decline, pp. 323‚Äì332.

In: Tushman, M.L. and Anderson, P. (Eds.), Managing Strategic Innovation and Change: A Collection of Readings, pp. 530-540. New York: Oxford University Press. Thus, top managers do not ‚Äòsee‚Äô the upcoming exogenous change, because their thinking and policies tend to constrain exploration and experimentation within the firm and inhibit the ability to bring about strategic change. A broader perspective arises from how exploration activities are suppressed in publicly owned companies as a result of the interplay between the CEO and other top executives, the Board of Directors, the pressure for short-term (improvements in) results arising from the capital market, and the substantial delay between the investment in exploration efforts and the return on these efforts.Walrave, B., Van Oorschot, K.E. and Romme, A.G.L. (2011), ‚ÄòGetting trapped in the suppression of exploration: A simulation model‚Äô. Journal of Management Studies, vol. 48, 1727-1751. Preventing the success trap The success trap can be best avoided early on, for example, by closely monitoring how other (e.g. leading) firms maintain a balance between exploitation and exploration activities, as well as by continually collecting information about changing customer needs, newly emerging technologies and other changes in the market and competitive environment. Drawing on this type of information, the executive board and board of directors together need to develop and sustain a shared long-term vision and strategy regarding the investments in exploitation and exploration activities. Once a publicly owned corporation has been suppressing exploration over an extended period of time, it tends to be almost impossible to get out of the success trap without major interventions - such as a hostile takeover by another corporation or an exit from the stock exchange. Consequences of the success trap Firms that fall into the success trap suffer long term consequences. They grow their revenues at a lower pace than other companies and also create less shareholder value than more exploratory companies. These patterns can be observed for S&P; 500 companies in the USA in the aggregate and also within industries.

A cliffed coast, also called an abrasion coast, is a form of coast where the action of marine waves has formed steep cliffs that may or may not be precipitous. It contrasts with a flat or alluvial coast.  Formation  Crags on the southwestern coast of thumb A cliffed coast in Sydney with houses and apartments. Dingli Cliffs in Malta. Abrasion cliff in Jinshitan Coastal National Geopark, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China. Wave-like texture was produced by coastal erosion In coastal areas in which the land surface dips at a relatively steep angle below the water table, the continuous action of marine waves on the coastline, known as abrasion, may create a steep declivity known as a cliff, the slope angle of which depends on a variety of factors including the jointing, bedding and hardness of the materials making up the cliff as well as the erosional processes themselves.Whittow, John (1984). Dictionary of Physical Geography. London: Penguin, 1984, p. 97. .Herbert Louis and Klaus Fischer: Allgemeine Geomorphologie, de Gruyter, 4th ed., Berlin 1979, pp. 532-537 The slope is constantly being eroded. The waves attacking the cliff-foot form a wave-cut notch by constant abrasion action producing an overhang. This overhang grows in size as the cliff is undercut, until it collapses under its own weight. The loose debris that has broken off is gradually carried away from the area in front of the cliff by the action of the sea. As the coastal cliffs collapse, the shoreline recedes inland. The speed at which this happens depends, in particular, on the strength of the surf, the height of the cliff, the frequency of storm surges and the hardness of the bedrock. Thus, the Mecklenburg coast in Germany recedes by about 25 centimetres per year, whereas the chalk cliffs of southern England retreat by just ¬Ω a centimetre each year. A cliffed coast is made of a loose bedrock material, such as at the Red Cliff on the German island of Sylt, but can also occur in hard rock like the red sandstone cliffs on Heligoland. There are, however, differences between the former and the latter regarding some peculiarities of the coast line.  Rocky cliffed coast  On a rocky cliffed coast made up of material which is relatively resistant to erosion such as sandstone, limestone or granite, a flat rocky wave-cut platform or abrasion platform is formed in front of the cliff. It represents the foot of the cliff preserved at and below the level of water table. If there is a tectonic uplift of the coast, these abrasion platforms can be raised to form coastal terraces, from which the amount of uplift can be calculated from their elevation relative to the sea level, taking into account any eustatic sea level changes. On a cliffed coast made up of material which is only fairly or even hardly resistant to erosion no wave- cut platform but a beach is formed in front of the sea cliff. If waves carve notches at a narrow point on both sides of a promontory on the rocky cliffed coast, a natural arch may be formed.Hans Georg Wunderlich: Einf√ºhrung in die Geologie, Band I, Exogene Dynamik, Bibliographisches Institut Mannheim/Wien/Z√ºrich, B.I.-Wissenschaftsverlag, Mannheim, 1968, p. 116 When the arch collapses as the coastline recedes further a stack is left behind on the wave-cut platform. The best-known example in Germany is the Lange Anna on Heligoland, while, in England, a prominent example are Old Harry Rocks in Dorset. Furthermore, on a rocky cliffed coast wave action is not the only driving force for coastline retreat. General weathering of the bedrock is almost equally important.  Living and dead cliffs  \\"Living cliffs\\" are those on a coast that is still active, i.e. that is being eroded and is receding. A \\"dead cliff\\", by contrast, is only reached by very high marine waves and is therefore subjected to very little change. A clear indication of a lack of activity at a dead cliff is a covering of vegetation that appears on the cliff as wave action against it subsides. Well-known coasts with living cliffs in Germany are the Red Cliff (Rote Kliff) in Kampen on the island of Sylt or the chalk cliffs on the Jasmund Peninsula. The K√∂nigsstuhl on the island of R√ºgen is a good example of a dead cliff. Others may be found in the regions of the present-day Wadden Sea coast of the North Sea a few kilometres inland. These show the former coastline from which the sea retreated as the level of water in the North Sea fell. Other processes Steep sea cliffs can also be caused by catastrophic debris avalanches. These have been common on the submerged flanks of ocean island volcanos such as the Hawaiian Islands and the Cape Verde Islands.Mitchell, N. (2003) Susceptibility of mid-ocean ridge volcanic islands and seamounts to large scale landsliding. Journal of Geophysical Research, 108, 1-23.

Jepson Manual Treatment.Leucopoa kingii. Grass Manual Treatment. is a species of grass known by the common names spike fescue and King's fescue. It is native to the western United States from Oregon and California east to Nebraska and Kansas. This grass is a clump-forming perennial growing from a rhizome. It produces erect stems up to a meter tall, or occasionally taller. Previous seasons' dry stems and leaves remain in the clump, and the clump sometimes makes a ring shape. The clumps can be 2 meters wide. The species is dioecious, with male and female parts on separate plants. The inflorescence is a narrow panicle with branches pressed up against the stem. The flowers lack awns. The plant reproduces by seed and by sprouting new clumps from its rhizome. This grass can be found in many habitat types, including forests, woodlands, shrublands, sagebrush, prairie, and grassland. It can occur at high elevation in subalpine and alpine climates. It can be found on dry, open slopes, generally in warmer spots. Female individuals are found in the more moist spots in the habitat, and generally do not make up more than 50% of the total individuals in any habitat. It is a climax species in some ecosystems, such as high, exposed ridges. It is a codominant species in some plant associations. In Wyoming it is dominant alongside Idaho fescue, and in Colorado it is a main understory species in Ponderosa pine communities. It is an indicator species for forests in Idaho and Wyoming. This grass is considered to be palatable and nutritious for livestock, but it is rarely abundant enough to be a main food source for them.

History Hyades was formed in 1996 by Lorenzo Testa. After 8 years of playing in the metal underground and releasing self-produced demos, the band signed with Belgian label Mausoleum Records and released their debut album, \\"Abuse Your Illusions\\", gaining worldwide attention. A few years before the thrash metal revival really took shape, Hyades produced a blend of European and US old-school thrash metal with fast drumming, mosh guitar riffing, old- school vocals and socially critical lyrics, combined with sense of humor. After the release of \\"Abuse Your Illusions\\" in 2004, Hyades toured Europe with Omen, playing for the first time in Germany, Denmark, Austria, Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland. The band released their second full-length album \\"And the Worst is yet to Come\\" in 2007 and continued to play all over Europe, sharing the stage with bands such as Onslaught, Sinister, Helstar, Tankard, Violator and others. Cover artwork was realized by Ed Repka, best known for creating Megadeth's mascot Vic Rattlehead and Dark Angel's logo. Following the gig with Tankard the band was asked to take part in \\"Best Case Scenario: 25 Years in Beers\\", Tankard compilation/tribute album released by AFM Records in 2007, with a personal revisitation of Tankard's song \\"Alien\\", originally included in \\"Alien\\" EP (1989). In 2008 Metal Hammer UK (Thrash Metal Collector's Special 2008) listed Hyades among the most representative 30 thrash metal bands alive and playing, together with Exodus, Forbidden and others. Hyades released the third album, titled \\"The Roots of Trash\\" in 2009 and toured again Europe. After the release of three albums in a short while, the band took a little break in order to concentrate to other musical projects. At the end of 2014 Hyades signed a deal with Italian record label Punishment18 and started recording the 10 tracks of the new album in January 2015 at Studio Decibel in Busto Arsizio, Italy.

It is also known under the name I√ß Kale (\\"Central/Inner Castle\\", \\"Citadel\\"). It was built in 1153 probably by Bagratid Armenian. The outer walls surrounding the city were built in the 12th century. The castle, which was destroyed by Timur in 1386, was rebuilt again in 1579 by Lala Mustafa Pasha, who came to Kars ordered by the Ottoman Sultan Murat III. It is said in the Ottoman sources that the castle was rebuilt with the help of one hundred thousand soldiers and workers. In 1606, the castle was destroyed by the Iranian Shah Abbas I, and in 1616 and in 1636 it was restored twice and new elements were added to it. The castle was hugely damaged after the occupation of the Russians after the Ottoman-Russian War of 1877-1878, and partially changed after 40 years of occupation. The walls of the Castle of Kars were made of basalt masonry. Layout The castle consisted of two sections, the internal and the external castles. The external walls were made of five layers. In addition, there were deep trenches made in front of it. The main castle looks to the east. The planning of the walls of the external castle is not quite quadrangle. The length of the castle's perimeter makes , it was supported with 22 watchtowers, of which only seven remained intact until today. The length of the internal castle makes in the east-west direction, and about in the north-south direction. The castle has four gates. The \\"Su Kapƒ±sƒ±\\" (literally: Water Gate) or \\"√áeriba≈üƒ± Kapƒ±sƒ±\\" is situated in the west, \\"Kagizman Kapƒ±sƒ±\\" orta \\"Orta Kapƒ±\\" in the south and \\"Behram Kapƒ±\\" in the east. The main gate located in the north opens up to a chasm in front of the castle. The castle's watchtower can be accessed by climbing the stairs or along the stone paved road. Just inside the main entrance is a shrine containing the tomb of Jelal Baba who died during the Mongolian invasion in 1239. Within the castle are military lodgings, an ammunition depot, and a small mosque that was rebuilt in the 1990s. Today, the castle is administered by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.Kars City Guide Cultural events In 2005, the castle hosted a music concert by Turkish pop singer Sezen Aksu attended by around 25,000 people. During the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan in 2011, a Mevlevi Sama ceremony was held for the first time at the castle.

Early life and education Riggs was born in Maryland in 1979 on a 200-year-old farm, and grew up in Florida, where he attended Pine View School for the Gifted. He studied English literature at Kenyon College, where he was a good friend of John Green. He later studied film at the University of Southern California. Career His work on short films for the Internet and blogging for Mental Floss got him a job writing The Sherlock Holmes Handbook which was released as a tie-in to the 2009 Sherlock Holmes film. Riggs had collected curious vernacular photographs and approached his publisher, Quirk Books, about using some of them in a picture book. On the suggestion of an editor, Riggs used the photographs as a guide from which to put together a narrative. The resulting book was Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, which made The New York Times Best Seller list, and was adapted into the 2016 film of the same name. Another book inspired by old photographs, Talking Pictures, was published by HarperCollins in October 2012. The second novel in the Miss Peregrine series, Hollow City, was released in January 2014, with the third installment, Library of Souls, following in September 2015.

He was Brighton's top scorer in the 1960‚Äì61 season with 14 goals in all competitions, and his five goals against Watford on the final day of the 1957‚Äì58 season ensured their promotion to the Second Division for the first time in the club's history. He also helped Exeter City to promotion from the Third Division in 1964. He went on to play non-League football for Barnet and Cheltenham Town. Career Thorne was born in Brighton in 1937 and attended Brighton, Hove and Sussex Grammar School. He was spotted by Brighton & Hove Albion as a 17-year-old playing for his school's Old Boys' team in the Sussex County League, and signed for the club in August 1954. Like many players in the 1950s, his career development was interrupted by the requirements of National Service, and he made his debut in the Third Division South on 18 January 1958, at the age of 20, scoring in a 2‚Äì0 defeat of Southend United. Going into the final game of the season, at home to Watford, Albion needed a point to secure the Third Division South title and promotion to the Second Division for the first time in the club's history. With Dave Sexton injured, Thorne was selected to make just his seventh League appearance: he scored five goals as Albion won 6‚Äì0. Despite scoring a goal every two games, and finishing the 1960‚Äì61 season as the club's top scorer, with 14 goals in all competitions, he was never an undisputed member of the starting eleven, and towards the end of that season he asked for a transfer. Thorne joined Second Division club Plymouth Argyle for an ¬£8,000 fee, but made little impact. In two years, he played only 12 games, scoring twice, and moved on to Exeter City during the 1963‚Äì64 season. He became a regular in the Exeter team that gained promotion to the Third Division that season, and remained with the club for another year before signing for Second Division Leyton Orient on a free transfer in the summer of 1965. At Orient, Thorne was reunited with former Brighton teammates Dave Sexton, now managing the club, and Tony Nicholas, but he played only twice for them in the League. He went on to play non-League football for Barnet and Cheltenham Town. Thorne married wife Gillian when he was a Plymouth player. While at Orient, he began to train as a teacher, gaining qualifications in science and physical education, and went on to work in that profession.

This feature is most used to represent the brands of organizations associated with, properties owned by, or general interests favored by a user of the hosting network. While also being potentially manageable by more than one registered user, pages are distinguished from groups in that pages are usually designed for the managers to direct messages and posts to subscribing users (akin to a newsletter or blog) and promote a brand, while groups are usually and historically formed for discussion purposes. History Prior to 2007, only a few websites made use of non-personal profile pages. Last.fm, established in 2002, used its music recommendation service to automatically generate \\"artist pages\\" which serve as portals for biographies, events and artist-related playlists. This approach, however, is not explicitly controlled by artists or music groups because of the automatic nature of artist pages; pages, for example, could be created from erroneous misspellings and miscredits of works which are accepted as-is by the Audioscrobbler recommendation service used by Last.fm. Furthermore, Last.fm has never advertised itself as a social networking service, despite accruing myriad social features since 2002. The most high- profile usage of this model is Facebook's Pages (formerly known as \\"Fan Page\\" until 2010) feature, launched in 2007; one could \\"be a fan of\\" a page until April 2010, when the parlance was replaced with \\"Like\\". Foursquare, a location-oriented social networking site, launched its \\"Brands\\" feature allowing for the creation of specialized brand pages in January 2010 (with Intel being the first user), but they did not become \\"self-serve\\" (controllable by individuals employed by page brand owners) until August 2011. LinkedIn, an enterprise-oriented social networking service, launched \\"Company Pages\\" in November 2010. Google+, the current social networking service operated by Google, launched its own \\"Pages\\" feature in October 2011. On November 19th, 2012, Amazon announced Amazon Pages giving brands self-service control over their presence on the site. On 8 December, Twitter announced that it would roll out \\"brand pages\\" as part of a major user interface redesign in 2012. Features Increasingly, brand pages make use of the following features: * Header banners * The ability to post blogs or replies on the brand page in the name of the brand page * The ability to administer multiple pages * Photos * Video * Maps (including the physical location of the page) * Subscribers * Other apps Twitter made use of header banners in their launch of brand pages, and Facebook made use of \\"cover photos\\" in their re-design of brand pages in March 2011. Uses Organizations and brands regularly make use of pages in order to syndicate news and upcoming events, especially off- site blog posts, to subscribing users. Page subscription numbers can also be used as a metric of trust or interest in the associated brand. Interests can also be indexed as pages, and are often the basis for the formation of mass social movements (i.e., the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street). Newsroom accounts Pages are also used as newsroom accounts. A newsroom account refers to any microblogging or social networking account branded by or owned by a publishing or broadcasting organization that is dedicated solely to syndicating content from a particular category of content as published on the original website of the organization. Such accounts have come into increased usage by news organizations as means by which: # A news organization's presence on a social networking or microblogging website is increased # A news organization can specialize content syndication to selective users who wish to subscribe News organizations that make use of multiple newsroom accounts typically allow for either online editors or multiple employed authors to edit and update the syndications of newsroom content. Such accounts are typically marked by graphic icons that make use of the brand symbol combined with distinct colors assigned to each account. Examples of newsroom accounts and pages include the Facebook pages for both The Guardian and the newspaper's Technology newsroom. Impact Pseudonyms The usage of pseudonyms on social networking services, long considered a preserve of user privacy, has been partially affected by the promotion of pseudonyms, as social networking services have encouraged users to create pages for pseudonyms and implemented legal name requirements for user profile registration (i.e., New York resident Stefani Germanotta keeping a separate personal user profile under her legal name while maintaining a fan page under her stage name and pseudonym Lady Gaga). Interest-based connections As pages can be created to represent interests, the number of attempts to create vertical social networking services (i.e., Ning) has leveled off in the 2010s. Social network advertising can also be targeted to users based upon their page subscriptions. Research Research into brand pages has looked at how the anthropomorphic cues of brand pages can affect engagement behaviour with consumers.

Dr David Johnson was ‚Äòan internationally recognised scholar‚Äô, whose work did much to rediscover and reinvent 18th century Scottish music, and set it in its historical context. Johnson‚Äôs key legacy is to leave behind a body of writing and editions which throws light on the music and wider social life of 18th century lowland Scotland, its influences and tastes, and the key musical figures within it. Early life Johnson was born in Edinburgh in October 1942, the eldest of three sons. His father, Sir Ronald Johnson, was a senior civil servant at the Scottish Home and Health Department and organist of the episcopal church of St. Columba‚Äôs-By-the-Castle. His mother, Lady Elizabeth, was the Director of the Holst Singers (of Edinburgh) and was organist at Rosslyn Chapel in Midlothian. Johnson was educated at the Steiner School in Edinburgh, and was musical from a young age, playing recorder, piano and cello, and composing a wide range of pieces for different instruments and having work published while still a school boy. He studied English at Aberdeen University. He then moved to St. John‚Äôs College, Cambridge, where he achieved a First in music. Scholarship At St. John‚Äôs College, Cambridge he completed a Doctoral Thesis under musicologist Charles Cudworth, which led to a 1972 book Music and Society in Lowland Scotland in the 18th Century. This remains a seminal work in its field and ‚Äòbrought to light the synergy between ‚Äòfolk‚Äô and ‚Äòart‚Äô music which existed in Baroque and Classical music of Scotland‚Äô. The book also examined music‚Äôs position in 18th century Scottish society, and the work of Thomas Erskine, 6th Earl of Kellie, and other notable composers of the period such as William McGibbon and James Oswald. Scottish Fiddle Music in the 18th Century followed in 1984, and in it Johnson brought his own editions of a wealth of important works for fiddle, and provided historical commentary and context. A further collection of 27 editions was published in 2000 as Chamber Music of Eighteenth-century Scotland, as part of the Musica Scotica series. Johnson also published a large number of editions through his own publishing house, David Johnson Music Editions, many under the Enlightenment Edinburgh heading. He also held short-term research and teaching posts at Napier University and Edinburgh University. Performance Johnson was a prolific performer and supporter of live music. He formed part of the McGibbon Ensemble, playing cello alongside Edna Arthur (fiddle) and Brice Gould (harpsichord), and performing regularly, including concerts across mainland Europe. The Ensemble also made two path-breaking albums in the 1980s: Music of Classical Edinburgh and Fiddle Pibroch and Other Fancies. Working as Artist Director he also brought a less populist, more challenging side of the songs of Robert Burns to light through two CDs by Scotstown exploring The Art of Robert Burns. Compositions Johnson‚Äôs output as a composer is not as well known as his scholastic work, and, despite a rich and varied body of performed works, his reputation during his life was predominantly local. His compositions trod what Nigel Osborne described as the ‚Äòpath of modesty and truth‚Äô, and his output ranged from solo works for recorder (e.g. Music for Hallowe‚Äôen, 1960), to five operas (e.g. Thomas the Rymer, 1976), to string quartets, to solo cello suites. Dawn Call for trumpet (1991) was written for John Wallace, while 12 Preludes and Fugues, (1995) was written for Ronald Stevenson. Johnson sought to make his compositions accessible and relevant, offered social commentary and sought a distinctly Scottish flavour. However, his work never reached the wider non-specialist audience he would have wished.

He was born on 6 October 1947 to Mariadoss and Ranjitham, a Catholic family from Ammapet in Thanjavur District of Tamil Nadu state. After finishing his basic education at Appavu Thevar High School at Ukkadai, he joined St. Mary's Minor Seminary to become a diocesan priest when the diocese was in a desperate need for the native priests and then he was sent to Sri Pushpam College, Poondi, along with F. Antonysamy, the present bishop of Kumbakonam to do a pre-university course for his secular UG degree. After finishing his secular studies, he was sent to St. Paul's Seminary, Trichy for his priestly formation and for his philosophical (B.ph) and theological studies (B.Th.). Eventually, he was ordained a priest on 5 August 1974 by Bishop Arokiasamy Sundaram, the first Bishop of Thanjavur. Priesthood After his ordination, he was appointed as an assistant parish priest of Nagapattinam. His dedicated service to the people especially during the times of severe cyclone is gratefully remembered even today. After spending 5 years at Nagapattinam, In 1979, he was sent to join the staff at St. Peter's Pontifical Seminary, Bangalore. Thus he became a professor in Sacred Scripture at St. Peter's Pontifical Institute. The Scripture department of the institute is the prestigious, having the world-renowned scholars and stalwarts such as Lucian Legrand. After a short period of probation, he was sent to Rome for his higher studies from 1980 to 1984, from where he received his licentiate (LSS) in sacred scripture from the Biblical Institute, Rome, run by the Jesuits. Then he came back to the seminary and taught sacred scripture for the seminarians. Again, from 1991 to 1994, he went to Paris, France, for his doctoral studies in the Catholic University, Paris (STD) where he came out with the flying colours of doctoral degree. Seeing his intellectual caliber, the University awarded him the doctoral degree with \\"Summa Cum Laude\\", the maximum possible. He had also received earlier a diploma in Biblical studies at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, making use of his summer holidays while he was doing his licentiate in Rome. While he was in St. Peter's Seminary, he had also rendered his service by being 'Registrar' of the Institute and then he was nominated as the bishop of Thanjavur on 28 June 1997 while he was still a Vice-Rector of the prestigious St. Peter's Seminary.  Bishop of Thanjavur  On 24 September 1997, Devadass Ambrose was solemnly consecrated as the third Bishop of Thanjavur by Simon Card. Lourdusamy along with the co-consecrators, Archbishops Michael Augustine, the Archbishop of Pondicherry-Cuddalore and Packiam Arokiasamy, the then out-going bishop of Thanjavur. He has been serving as the Bishop of Thanjavur for more than 23 years. Education In 1997 Devadass Ambrose began to push for the creation of new schools and colleges, which would give quality education to poor children in an affordable fees structure. A first institution for girls, named \\"Our Lady of Good Health School of Nursing\\", was opened in 2005 at Thanjavur, followed soon by a second one for boys and girls. Now there are at least five higher education institutions with various disciplines. The collected fee is used for the maintenance of the institutions and their infrastructure; deserving students also receive scholarships for their studies.

The syllabus for the NEET is taken from CBSE. Unfortunately the diocese does not have a single CBSE school and hence to start with, the Bishop wanted to establish one such school in Thanjavur at Bishop Sundaram Campus. There are two blocks, one for Primary and the other for the Secondary. The Primary Block is dedicated to His Grace, Packiam Arokiasamy, the Second Bishop of Thanjavur and the Secondary Block is dedicated to Rt. Rev. R. A. Sundaram, the first bishop of Thanjavur.

The striking pattern of onset seizures at a young age, genetic testing and laboratory results, potential developmental delays or developmental regression and associated disorders, eases diagnosis. The National Institutes of Health Office and Rare Disease Research characterizes PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy as a rare disorder. Although formal epidemiologic data is not available, results from diagnostic screenings indicate that approximately 1 out of 10 girls who have seizure onset before five years of age may have PCDH19 mutations.  Signs and symptoms  PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy is a highly variable and rare epileptic syndrome, characterized by the early-onset of seizure clusters, with a range of 4 ‚Äì 60 months, and an average onset at 12.9 months. Other aspects, such as varying degrees of cognitive impairment and behavioral and psychiatric problems, are also common, but are not essential for diagnosis of PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy. PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy shares several clinical features with other early-onset epileptic encephalopathies, such as Dravet Syndrome, Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), FIRES (febrile infection‚Äìrelated epilepsy syndrome) Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or epilepsy of unknown origin. However, the disorder has a distinct evolution of symptoms, and is associated with specific genetic mutations of the PCDH19 gene.  Seizures  The hallmark characteristic of PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy is early-onset cluster seizures that often cause cyanotic spells, which start in infancy or early childhood. The onset of the first cluster of seizures usually coincides with a fever (febrile seizures), however subsequent seizures may be febrile or afebrile. The seizure clusters are generally brief seizures, lasting 1‚Äì5 minutes, often accompanied by fearful screaming observed in 63% of girls. These cluster seizures can occur more than 10 times a day over several days, with varying amounts of time between seizure clusters. Over time, children with PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy tend to exhibit multiple seizure types, including focal, generalized tonic-clonic, tonic, atonic, myclonus, and absence seizures. In a small study of 35 female patients with PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy, rare episodes of status epilepticus occurred in about 30% of patients in the early course of the disorder. In PCDH19 gene- related epilepsy, the seizures are often refractory to treatment, especially in infancy and childhood. Additionally, seizures are usually characterized by persistence of cluster seizures, with variable frequency. In a study of 35 female patients with PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy, approximately 30% had become seizure free in the girl's childhood (mean age of 12 years), yet some continued into adulthood. In the same study, a few patients still had recurrent cluster seizures that evolved into status epilepticus in childhood or early adolescence. Developmental problems Beyond early-onset and treatment-resistant cluster seizures, PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy is usually, but not always, associated with cognitive and sensory impairment of varying degrees, and psychiatric and behavioral problems. It is estimated that up to 60 to 75% of the females have cognitive deficits, ranging from mild to severe intellectual disability, which do not appear to be related to frequency or severity of seizures. Development over the course of a female patients‚Äô childhood can follow one of three courses: delays from birth that persist into adulthood, normal development and then regression, or normal intellectual development. It is not yet clear why some people experience delayed intellectual growth and others regress with epilepsy. From the University of Melbourne study, two-thirds of PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy patients have borderline intellectual functioning or intellectual disability, while one third have normal intelligence. A connection to depression, autism, obsessive and aggressive behaviors and other disorders has been observed in PCDH19 gene- related epilepsy. Approximately 40-60% of girls diagnosed with a PCDH19 mutation are on the autism spectrum. Many of those with PCDH19 gene mutations also exhibit behavioral and psychological problems ‚Äì including ADHD, aggression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anxiety. Other neurological abnormalities may present, including sleep disturbances, ictal apnea, motor deficits, hypotonia, language delay, sensory integration problems and dysautonomia. Causes A 2008 study, found a relationship between the PCDH19 gene and early onset female seizures, with subsequent studies confirming the relationship. PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy can arise as a single case in a family, due to a de novo error in cell replication, or it can be inherited. In a large series of cases in which inheritance was determined, half of the PCDH19 mutations occurred de novo, and half were inherited from fathers in good health, and who had no evidence of seizures or cognitive disorders. Men and women can transmit the PCDH19 mutation, although females, but not males, usually, but not always, exhibit symptoms, which can be very mild. Females with a mutation have a 50% chance of having children who are carriers. Men have a 100% chance of transmitting the mutation to a daughter and 0% chance to a son. Although males do not generally exhibit PCDH19 gene-related history such as cluster seizures, in a study involving four families with PCDH19 gene mutations, 5 of the fathers had obsessive and controlling tendencies. The linkage of chromosome Xq22.1 to PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy in females was confirmed in all of the families. The inheritance pattern is very unusual, in that men that carry the PCDH19 gene mutation on their only X-chromosome are typically unaffected, except in rare instances of somatic mosaicism.[11] Alternatively, approximately 90% of women, who have the mutation on one of their two X-chromosomes, exhibit symptoms. It has been suggested that the greater occurrence of PCDH19-epilepsy in females may relate to X-chromosome inactivation, through a hypothesized mechanism termed ‚Äò‚Äòcellular interference‚Äô‚Äô. A 2011 study found instances where patients had PCDH19 mutation, but their parents did not. They found that \\"gonadal mosaicism‚Äù of a PCDH19 mutation in a parent is an important molecular mechanism associated with the inheritance of a mutated PCDH19 gene. Genetics The PCDH19 gene is located on the long (q) arm of the X chromosome at position 22.1. The gene encodes for protocadherin 19, a transmembrane protein of calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules that is strongly expressed in neural tissue, such as the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and amygdala. Protocadherin 19 appears to be related to synaptic transmission and formation of synaptic connections during brain development. A mutation in the PCDH19 gene can cause the protocadherin 19 protein to be malformed, reduced in function or not produced at all. This abnormal expression of protocadherin 19 causes deficits in GABAergic signaling, causing the occurrence of seizures beginning in the early years of life. The expression of the PCDH19 mutation is highly variable, with some individuals appearing unaffected, and others showing severe disease. Even monozygotic twins with the mutation may have variations in seizure frequency and degree of cognitive impairment. Currently, the PCDH19 gene is the second most clinically relevant gene in the epilepsy field; the second largest number of epilepsy related mutations characterized thus far occur in the PCDH19 gene. The SCN1A gene, associated with Dravet Syndrome, is the most clinically relevant. Classification Due to its recent discovery, PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy does not have a specific classification according to the International League Against Epilepsy. PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy is thought to develop based upon a deficiency of the calcium-dependent cell-adhesion PCDH19 (protocadherin 19) gene. Its cause and pathophysiology (cause and mechanisms by which damage occurs) are different from other epilepsies, although the symptoms are very similar to other epileptic syndromes, such as Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), Dravet syndrome with SCN1A negative, FIRES (febrile infection‚Äìrelated epilepsy syndrome) Lennox- Gastaut syndrome or epilepsy of unknown origin. Diagnosis PCDH19 gene- related epilepsy is clinically based on patient and family seizure history, cognitive and behavioral neuropsychological evaluation, neurological examination, electroencephalogram (EEG) studies, and long term observation. Diagnosis is confirmed using molecular testing for PCDH19 mutations. Diagnostic test The test is particularly indicated in children who have had cluster seizures in series. It is also recommended for patients who are diagnosed GEFS+ and when the seizures are associated with fever, infection, experienced regression, delayed cognitive growth or behavioral problems. The test is typically ordered by neurologists. The diagnostic test can be done by drawing blood or saliva of the patient and their immediate family. It is analyzed in laboratories that specialize in genetic testing. Genetic testing can aid in a firmer diagnosis and understanding of the disorder, may aid in identifying the optimal treatment plan and if positive, testing of the parents can determine if they are carriers. (See Genetic Counseling) Treatment Medication Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are used in most cases to control seizures, however, PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy is generally associated with early-onset development of drug resistant seizures. Existing data supports the use of ‚Äúrational polypharmacy,‚Äù which consists of a step-wise addition of AEDs until a patient responds favorably or experiences intolerable adverse events. In general, as in other types of uncontrolled epilepsy, the use of drugs with different mechanisms of action appears to be more effective than combining drugs with similar mechanisms of action. No currently marketed AEDs have been extensively studied in PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy and there is no established treatment strategy for girls diagnosed with PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy. Patients may respond well to treatment with levetiracetam and in cases of drug resistance, stiripentol, which is not approved in the U.S. but is available through the FDA Expanded Access IND process. Seizures might be easier to control with age, especially after the second decade of life. However, some publications have shown that medication withdrawal is highly associated with seizure recurrence. Urgent care At the hospital, physicians follow standard protocol for managing seizures. Cluster seizures are generally controlled by benzodiazepines such as diazepam, midazolam, lorazepam or clonazepam. The use of oxygen is recommended in the United States, but in Europe it is only recommended in cases of prolonged epileptic status. Epidemiology The National Institute of Health Office and Rare Disease Research characterizes PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy as a rare disorder. Rare diseases, by definition, are diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Since the mutation associated with PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy was only recently identified in 2008, the true incidence of the disease is generally unknown. Although formal epidemiologic data is not available, results from diagnostic screening indicates that approximately 1 out of 10 girls who have seizure onset before five years of age may have PCDH19 gene mutations. Additionally, PCDH19 screening of several large cohorts of females with early onset febrile-related epilepsy has resulted in a rate of approximately 10% of mutation-positive individuals. History Juberg and Hellman originally described the disorder in 1971 in the Journal of Pediatrics, where they reported a family in which 15 female relatives, who were related either as sisters or first cousins through their fathers, had early onset seizures with cognitive impairments. In subsequent peer-reviewed literature, the disorder was referred to as ‚Äúepilepsy and mental retardation limited to female‚Äù (EFMR), and later called EIEE9 or Juberg-Hellman Syndrome. The syndrome in this family was characterized by the occurrence of childhood seizures. Some of the girls showed developmental regression with intellectual disabilities that ranged from mild to profound. The disorder has an unusual inheritance pattern. It is considered X-linked dominant with male carriers. Women and men with the affected gene can transmit the disease. The men expressed a normal phenotype. The disorder was shown to be linked to mutations via Xq22 microsatellite markers.[nb 4][4] Due to the apparent female-limited expression of the condition, it eluded genetic mapping until 1997, which is when Ryan et al. mapped the responsible gene to the X-chromosome. Eleven years after the success of Ryan et al., in 2008, systematic sequencing of X-chromosome exons in seven large families diagnosed with EFMR revealed PCDH19 gene mutations as the cause. This led to a shift in describing EMFR as PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy. The discovery of the PCDH19 gene mutation led to the development of a genetic test for PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy. In 2009, Depienne et al. identified a male with a somatic mosaicism for PCDH19 gene deletion and a Dravet-like seizure disorder. The findings resulted in Depienne et al. to identify PCDH19 mutations in patients with SCN1A negative Dravet syndrome. This led to additional reports of PCDH19 positive patients, which broadened the clinical spectrum of the disorder.  Society and culture Caregivers of individuals living with PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy may seek support and information from a variety of resources, including the PCDH19 Alliance, The Cute Syndrome Foundation, and Insieme per la Ricerca PCDH19 - ONLUS (Italy). The PCDH19 World Conference, which is organized by Insieme per la Ricerca PCDH19 - ONLUS, occurs every other year, in odd years, in Rome, Italy. In alternating years, the PCDH19 Epilepsy Professional and Family Symposium is hosted in San Francisco, California. In 2014, the PCDH19 Registry was established, which is organized and funded by the PCHD19 Alliance, Boston Children's Hospital and the University of California, San Francisco. International PCDH19 Awareness Day is held annually on November 9. Research  Registry  A PCDH19 Registry was established by the PCDH19 Alliance, Boston Children's Hospital and the University of California, San Francisco, to provide a meaningful resource of patients with PCDH19 gene- related epilepsy and to better understand the epilepsy and behavioral aspects associated with the mutation. Parallel associations European families are sponsoring basic and applied research in an Australian team and researching in other projects with the aim of finding a drug target for epilepsy PCDH19.[28]  Basic research  Ann Poduri and Alex Rotenberg at Boston Children's Hospital are currently conducting PCDH19-related epilepsy in zebrafish. The research, which is funded by grants from The Cute Syndrome Foundation and The Richard A. and Susan F. Smith President's Innovation Fund of Boston Children's Hospital, hopes to establish an animal model of PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy, which can then be used to screen potential therapeutics and treatments. Dr. Jack Parent and his research team at the University of Michigan are currently conducting research to understand how PCHD19 gene mutations leads to disruptions in brain development. The research, funded by a grant from The Cute Syndrome Foundation, is seeking to reprogram fibroblasts from subjects with the PCHD19 mutation into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), which will then be used to make patient-specific neurons in a cell culture environment. The researchers are looking to see if these patient-specific neurons produce epileptic-like activity, as well as to discover the mechanism underlying the seizures and cognitive dysfunction associated with PCDH19 mutations. The Cute Syndrome Foundation and Insieme per la Ricerca PCDH19 - ONLUS recently awarded a two-year research grant to Drs. Maria Passafaro and Elena Battaglioli, from the CNR Neuroscience Institute and University of Milano, respectively. The researchers plan to unravel the molecular mechanism of PCDH19 gene mutations. The proposal also includes using AON exon skipping, which would be the first use of this method in epilepsy. Parallel associations European families are sponsoring basic and applied research in an Australian team and researching in other projects with the aim of finding a drug target for epilepsy PCDH19.PCDH19 Association \\"Insieme per la Ricerca PCDH19\\"  Gene therapy  It was assumed that all encephalopathies or cognitive impairments were irreversible, but an experiment with mice showed that is not always the case. In that experiment, MECP2 protein was blocked; males died, and females developed Rett syndrome (seizures, cognitive and psychomotor problems, respiratory problems, etc.) When the researchers reversed the situation and let the MECP2 protein work properly, the mice recovered.[clarification needed] This research revolutionized understanding regarding genetic syndromes that present with neurological impairment or intellectual disabilities.  Therapeutics  In February 2015, Marinus Pharmaceuticals commenced a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ganaxolone, a synthetic analog of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone, for the treatment of uncontrolled seizure in pediatric females with PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy. The study will enroll up to 10 female pediatric patients, between the ages of 2 and 10 years old, with a confirmed PCDH19 genetic mutation. The primary endpoint of the study is percent change in seizure frequency per 28 days relative to baseline. The Epilepsies Research Centre and Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, are working on a compound to treat this disease. On May 26, 2011 it patented a method of diagnosis and PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy treatment.

Very few have been recovered from the Guatemalan Highlands and it is unlikely they were ever manufactured there.Thompson 1970, 1990, p.147. Small obsidian eccentrics have been found at the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico.Thompson 1970, 1990, p.149. Physical characteristics Eccentric flints are among the finest lithic artifacts produced by the ancient Maya. They were very technically challenging to produce, requiring considerable skill on the part of the artisan. Large obsidian eccentrics can measure over in length.Williams 2010. Their actual form varies considerably but they generally depict human, animal and geometric forms associated with Maya religion. Context and possible use Most examples of eccentric flints have been recovered from caches interred under Maya monuments and buildings.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.45. Thus, a cache under the altar of Copan's stela M, at the foot of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, rendered three identical eccentric flints, each shaped like a human figure extending into a tang and evincing six human head outgrowths.Fash 2001: 147 Fig. 92 Nine eccentric flints with human figures found in an early Copan temple room (temple 16, Rosalila phase), and originally wrapped in a deep blue cloth, show similar tangs. The presence of these tangs suggests that the examples concerned may originally have been set into a shaft or handle, possibly as the head of a sceptre, or as the blade of an axe.For such an axe blade, see vase K5850 on research.mayavase.com/kerrn Some flint eccentrics were unsuitable for wearing or carrying and they may have been sculpted specifically to be buried as an offering.Miller 1999, p.83. Subjects depicted Eccentric flints show a great variety of forms, such as crescents, crosses, snakes, and scorpions. The largest and most elaborate ones display multiple human heads, with minor heads sometimes branching off from larger ones (see fig. 1). The human face is youthful and crafted as a simple outline, with emphasis on the sloping forehead and the lips.Miller 1999, p.228. An element more or less resembling a smoking torch, and symbolizing lightning, is often set in the forehead (see fig. 2). For this reason, these human faces are commonly regarded as transformations of the lightning deity, god K (K'awiil).Miller and Martin 2004: 150 More specifically, they appear to represent the Tonsured Maize God as a lightning deity, perhaps in a protective role.Agurcia, Sheets, Taube 2016: 32-37 Eccentric flints representing the lightning deity himself are also found,Miller and Martin 2004: 150 Pl. 80 though with less frequency, while some eccentric flints combine both human and God K faces.e.g., Finamore and Houston 2010: 154, fig. 10 The most famous eccentric flint is perhaps the one interpreted by Linda Schele and her co- authorsSchele and Miller 1986: 286 Pl. 114; Freidel and Schele 1993: 91 as a 'crocodile canoe' transporting the anthropomorphic soul of the dead as its 'passenger'. Anthropological background As a background to the eccentric flints showing deities associated with lightning, it is noteworthy that among the traditional Maya and in Mesoamerica generally, obsidian is considered \\"fossilized lightning\\", sometimes believed to have split off from the lightning deities' axes.Staller and Stross 2013: 175 The lightning deity warrants agricultural fertility.e.g., Christenson 2001: 134 As to the 'lightnings' with a human aspect, certain powerful individuals are believed to possess lightning energies, and to have the lightning bolt for a transformation.Houston and Stuart 1989: 1-2 Notes References : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : Mesoamerican artifacts Mesoamerican archaeology Maya art Classic period in Mesoamerica Hardstone carving Chert Lithics Archaeological artefact types ","title":"Eccentric flint"},{"id":"34215702","text":"Myron Willis Roderick (September 15, 1934 - December 28, 2011) was an American wrestler, coach of wrestling and tennis, and college athletics administrator.

Naval career Sayer joined the Royal Navy at an early age and first saw action in HMS Phoenix in the campaign against Tipu Sultan on the Malabar Coast.The United Service Magazine, 1831, Part 2, page 222 Promoted to lieutenant in July 1793, he was serving in during the Frigate action of 29 May 1794 when the Carysfort recaptured the French ship Castor. His first command was the sloop HMS Lacedemonian in 1796. He later commanded HMS Albacore, HMS Xenophon, and . In Inspector, Sayer conveyed the Prince of Orange from England to the Continent. Sayer received promotion to post captain on 14 February 1801, but was appointed to his next command, , only in late 1804.Gentleman's Magazine (May 1831), Vol. 101, Part 1, p.468. He was given command of HMS Galatea in July 1805 and on 11 September 1805 shared with , Africaine, , , and the schooner in the proceeds of the capture of the brig Hiram. On 18 August 1806 Lieutenant M'Culloch used Galateas barge to pursue a schooner several miles up a river near Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, to cut out a privateer schooner. The schooner resisted the boarding party until she lost her commander and a crew member, at which time she surrendered. She proved to be a Spanish, armed with three long 6 and 4-pounders, some swivel guns, and musketoons. M'Culloch blew her up as he could not safely bring her out. He did return with the prisoners. Galatea suffered one man wounded in the affair. Three days later Galateas boats under Lieutenant Walker captured a small Spanish privateer armed with swivel guns and small arms. Her crew, however, escaped; Walker had her destroyed. Galateas boats captured the French corvette Lynx off Les Saintes on 21 January 1807. The boats, manned with five officers, 50 seamen and 20 marines, had to row for eight hours, mainly in the blazing sun, to catch her. During the action Lieutenant William Coombe, who had already lost a leg in a previous action, received a musket ball through the thigh above the previous amputation. The British only succeeded in boarding Lynx on their third attempt and a desperate struggle occurred on deck as the crew of the Lynx outnumbered their attackers. The British lost nine men killed and 22 wounded, including Coombe. The French had 14 killed and 20 wounded, including the captain. Sayer was also present at the capture of the Danish West Indies in December 1807. He returned to Britain in Galatea in 1809. He commissioned HMS Leda in November 1809 and sailed for the East Indies on 9 June 1810.Winfield (2008), p.168. In doing so, he escorted some East Indiamen to Bengal, one of them being Earl Spencer.The Asiatic Annual Register Or a View of the History of Hindustan and of the Politics, Commerce and Literature of Asia (1812), p. 68. In August 1811 Sayer took part in the Invasion of Java under Sir Robert Stopford. In June 1813 he led a punitive expedition to Borneo to subdue the Sultanate of Sambas. Following the death of Sir Samuel Hood in December 1814 Sayer became Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Station. In June 1815 Sayer was succeeded by Sir George Burlton but in November 1815 Burlton died at Madras and Sayer again became Commander-in-Chief, remaining in that post until November 1816 when Sir Richard King arrived. Sayer was appointed CB and became a Rear Admiral of the Blue in July 1830. He died, unmarried, at his home in Craven Street in London.

It is possible St Michael‚Äôs was founded by Crowland.John S Hartley and Alan Rogers, The Religious Foundations of Medieval Stamford. Stamford Survey Group Report 2. University of Nottingham, 1974. The Medieval church comprised a nave with north and south aisles and a chancel with north and south chapels and was a frequent meeting place in Medieval Stamford of ecclesiastical courts and corporation meetings.Lincolnshire Record Society publications (various). It was extensively altered in the fifteenth century and again in the seventeenth at which time its western tower was made of wood, until 1761 when replaced in stone. The church survived until 1832 when it collapsed after the Rector, the Rev. Charles Swann, removed a number of internal pillars from the nave apparently for aesthetic reasons.Martin Smith.

The conversion, by Arthur Mull Associates of Huntingdon was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as ‚Äúan unsympathetic use and an appalling conversion‚Äù. The interior was gutted and divided, and its Georgian plasterwork and stained-glass windows destroyed. While a fifteenth-century octagonal font was dispatched to St Nicholas Church, Leicester, a peal of eighteenth-century bells, a pair of seventeenth-century silver flagons and other church plate was apparently dispersed. The organ built by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd in 1863 was dispersed to St Mark's, Killylea, Co. Armagh in 1967. Six plate-glass shop windows were introduced into the north wall, the shopping units extending to the ‚Äòrear‚Äô of the building on the ground floor while the remainder is used for storage. A car-park and delivery area were introduced at the rear, flattening much of the Medieval churchyard, although a number of fine eighteenth and nineteenth century tombstones and memorials, and in particular a late- seventeenth century chest tomb, survive. Even so, what little remains has also been threatened with development every few years, and a number of attempts made to build shop units upon it. The churchyard remains in the care of South Kesteven District Council. A Holocaust memorial was added in the twenty-first century. In 2016 gates bearing the Stamford arms were commissioned.

Early life Reid was born in Edinburgh in June 1805, the second son of Peter Reid (1777‚Äì1838) and his wife, Christian Arnot, eldest daughter of Hugo Arnot of Balcormo, and was the elder brother of Hugo Reid. When born the family appear to have lived with Peter Reid Sr., a vintner at Milne's Square (now known as Milne's Court) off the Royal Mile.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1805 His father gained his doctorate as a physician c.1810 and in 1815 the family was living independently at 7 Roxburgh Place in Edinburgh's South Side.Edinburgh Post Office Directory David was educated at the High School in Edinburgh then studied Medicine at Edinburgh University, obtained his medical diploma on 12 July 1830, and was admitted a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh, on 2 August 1831. Chemistry laboratory, from Reid's Brief Outline Illustrations of the Alterations in the House of Commons (1837) In 1831 Reid began to give classes in practical chemistry. He was soon appointed assistant to Thomas Charles Hope, professor of chemistry at the university. The same year he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his sole proposer being Hope. He was living at this time at 37 Nicholson Street, described as \\"experimental rooms\\" for Edinburgh University.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1831 In 1833, however, he had a disagreement with Hope. At this point he set up a laboratory of his own. Reid hoped to have a chair in Practical Chemistry set up in his favour; but he came up against Robert Christison as Dean of the Medical Faculty who was opposed, disliking the effect on the existing chair, and regarding Reid's teaching as too mechanical. Reid complained in The Scotsman. In 1835 at the Dublin meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science Reid talked on reform of education in chemistry, and was asked to give evidence to the committee under Thomas Wyse then looking into education in Ireland. One of his chemistry students was Macquorn Rankine. Reid continued to give private chemistry classes until he moved to London in 1847. Reid the Ventilator Reid invited participants at the 1834 meeting of the British Association, in Edinburgh, to visit his laboratory; and among those who took up the offer were some members of parliament. Fortuitously there was a very destructive fire at the Houses of Parliament at Westminster later in 1834, and Reid was brought in as a consultant. He did innovative work in the temporary accommodation on forced ventilation. When the new building work started on the same site, he was in a strong position to carry out plans that were systematic as far as ventilation was concerned. He was remembered as \\"Dr. Reid the ventilator\\" in the twenty-first century in discussions of energy efficiency, by Lord Wade of Chorlton. The Central Tower of the Palace of Westminster. This octagonal spire was for ventilation purposes, in the more complex system imposed by Reid on Barry, in which it was to draw air out of the Palace. The design was for aesthetic disguise of its function. In January 1840 Reid was appointed by the committee for the House of Lords dealing with the construction of the replacement for the Houses of Parliament that had burned down six years earlier. The post was in the capacity of ventilation engineer, in effect; and with its creation there began a long series of quarrels between Reid and Charles Barry, the architect. Reid's ventilation system was adopted reluctantly by Barry in this new Palace of Westminster. Reid was engaged for five years at Westminster on this work. Reid made a reputation by his work in Westminster. He was commissioned for an air quality survey in 1837 by the Leeds and Selby Railway in their tunnel. The steam vessels built for the Niger expedition of 1841 were fitted with ventilation systems based on Reid's Westminster model. Air was dried, filtered and passed over charcoal. The system proved a cumbersome failure. A detailed account was published by James Ormiston McWilliam. Reid's ventilation method was also applied more fully to St. George's Hall, Liverpool, the only building, he said, in which his system was completely carried out. In this case the architect Harvey Lonsdale Elmes requested in 1841 that Reid should be involved in ventilation design. In 1852 Reid was dismissed from his position at the Houses of Parliament. His immediate replacement was Alfred Meeson, who had been assistant to Barry. Leading Tory politicians including Benjamin Disraeli had had enough of his feud with Barry, and Lord Derby thought him a charlatan. In an extended process of settlement, Reid received substantial compensation for his dismissal. Royal Commission on public health In 1843 Reid sat on the 13-man Royal Commission to inquire into \\"the state of large towns and populous districts in England and Wales with reference to the causes of disease among the inhabitants, and into the best means of promoting and securing public health\\". With the other medical men James Ranald Martin, Richard Owen and Lyon Playfair, he made up the dominant group on the committee.Gray, Benjamin Kirkman (1908) Philanthropy and the State; or, social politics, p. 53. He wrote the 1845 Report on the state of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and other towns (HMSO). His visits had included areas of great poverty and squalor, such as Sandgate. It had immediate effects. For example, his findings on Sunderland and South Shields led to the setting up in 1846 of the Sunderland Water Company. His observation on cholera, that there were no privies in the mines, was mentioned in the celebrated paper On the pathology and mode of communication of cholera of John Snow in 1849. In the USA In 1856 Reid moved to the United States. His stature as an author on sanitation was recognised by the physician Elisha Harris writing in Reid's Ventilation in American Dwellings (1858). Reid was brought as a professor of physiology and hygiene to the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1859 by Henry Barnard, and then dismissed after a year.Curti, Merle Eugene, and Carstensen, Vernon Rosco (1949) The University of Wisconsin: a history, Volume 1, p. 183. He then became government medical inspector to the sanitary commission of the United States. On the outbreak of the American Civil War new military hospitals were erected throughout the country, and Reid was about to leave Washington on a tour of inspection when he came down with a fatal illness. He died at Washington on 5 April 1863. Reid's Theories Reid was regarded as an expert on ventilation, but his views differed from Neil Arnott, another leader in theories of air and fever. He also regarded the susceptible individual in a different way than Southwood Smith, with more weight placed on predisposition. In a work on public hygiene by John Bell M.D. of Philadelphia for the New York Board of Councilmen, Reid's views on carbonic acid gas in old graveyards and \\"vitiated\\" air are quoted; and on \\"those subtle poisons called miasms\\" he is said to have reported that he \\"has detected their escape from graves more than twenty feet deep\\". Reid took \\"moving air\\" to be important to health, and emphasised the health hazards of \\"defective ventilation\\". Works He was author of: *Rudiments of Chemistry: with illustrations of the chemical phenomena of daily life (1836) *Elements of Chemistry (1837) *Textbook for Students of Chemistry(1839). In 1844 he published Illustrations of the Theory and Practice of Ventilation.

Biography  After early childhood in Munich, his parents moved to Leipzig in 1935. Due to his very conservative family he only was introduced to music of Classical Period and German Romantic Music up to Richard Wagner with the complete lack of contemporary music. The composer Felix Petyrek who gave the young Sauter piano lessons in his home was the first to introduce him to new music. Sauter then joined the famous Thomasschule where the so-called \\"Bachpflege\\" as part of his musical lessons sensitized his hearing. At war end in 1945 on the run back to Munich nearly all of his first compositions were destroyed or lost. The composition \\"Saitenspiel\\" was one of the few rescued compositions. In 1947 after passing his university entrance diploma Sauter began studying piano at the Akademie der Tonkunst in Munich. Unfortunately he had to abandon his studies due to financial reasons. He continued taking private piano lessons with Maria Landes-Hindemith where he was introduced to her husband Rudolf Hindemith (of Paul Hindemith's brother) who gave him new motivation to start composing again. Over time this influence was too less progressive and led to a discord based on Hindemiths criticism of the \\"Musica Viva\\" concert series founded by Karl Amadeus Hartmann in 1945. In the late fifties Sauter discovered the ballet genre and joined the Junge Ballett Compagnie (JBC, Deutsches Ballett-Theater, Bonn) where he first did arrangements \\"Es war eine k√∂stliche Zeit\\" broadcast by the Bayerischer Rundfunk and instrumentations (Bizet, Jeux d‚Äôenfants). Sauter composed his first ballet \\"Blue Jeans\\" for the JBC which was broadcast by the Saarl√§ndischer Rundfunk The closure of the JBC led to a mental and financial crisis for Sauter which in succession let his self-criticism destroy some of his non published compositions. In 1965 Sauter got an offer from Yvonne Georgi the head of the ballet at the Staatsoper Hannover to write the music for a new ballet called \\"Finale\\". Despite a successful performance the collaboration with Georgi had to end due to her sudden retirement. In 1976 he wrote a quadrophonic scenic music (\\"Remontage\\") which had its debut performance at the \\"Tage der neuen Musik\\" in Hannover in 1977. The \\"Requiem f√ºr eine T√§nzerin\\" a \\"Tape Music for Dancers\\" produced by Germinal Casado followed in 1978 and was a long running great success Sauter had concerns to be rated solely as a ballet composer. This and his wish to be independent and perhaps also the desire to \\"be somewhere else\\" led to the decision to relocate to the South of France. Thanks to the support of his friends, foremost of the conductor George Alexander Albrecht, Sauter was able to get to work in the solitude and quietness of the Provence without losing the connection to the outside world. There in 1983/84 the first feature-length piece, a ballet \\"Till Eulenspiegel\\" based on de Costers novel La L√©gende d‚ÄôUlenspiegle was created. Again a commissioned work for the Staatsoper Hannover. In 1986 Sauter choose Suzette a small village in the Dentelles near Avignon and Orange as new residence. There he composed his first piano concerto (\\"Concerto Russe\\") devoted to Gerhard Oppitz who played the debut performance on the occasion of the Tchaikovski year 1993 in Hanover. The wish to create his own sphere let him organize an annual summer festival called \\"Festival MUSIQUE D √âT√â √Ä SUZETTE\\" for chamber music ensembles in the small church of Suzette. It was his goal to present not only classical pieces to the interested audience but also pieces of contemporary composers like Penderecki, Ligeti, Schnittke etc. After several years of groundwork Sauter was able to compose own pieces for the festival and have them performed by artists of international reputation. The 3 string trios devoted to and performed by the \\"Deutsches Streichtrio\\" and \\"Verr√† La Morte\\" for soprano and string quartet performed by Christina Ascher and the Szymanowski-Quartet are vivid examples.

It was one of the first major cases examining in detail the division of powers between the federal Parliament and the provincial Legislatures, set out in the Constitution Act, 1867 (originally known as the British North America Act, 1867). The issue was whether a provincial statute which authorised the municipality of St. Stephen, New Brunswick to issue a debenture to fund a railway connecting to the United States was within provincial jurisdiction as a local tax matter, or whether it intruded on federal jurisdiction over inter-provincial and international railways. The case was decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for Canada within the British Empire. The Judicial Committee allowed an appeal from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick and held that the legislation was within provincial jurisdiction as a matter of local taxation, coming under sections 92(2) and 92(16) of the Constitution Act, 1867. The statute did not intrude on federal jurisdiction over inter-jurisdictional railways, under s. 91(29) and s. 92(10) of the Constitution Act, 1867.Dow v Black (1874-75), 6 AC 272, [1875 UKPC 17] (PC).Constitution Act, 1867, 30 & 31 Victoria, c. 3 (UK); RSC 1985, App. II, No. 5. Facts St. Stephen is a town in Charlotte County, in southern New Brunswick. Debec, New Brunswick is north of St. Stephen, in Carleton County on the border with the United States. Houlton, Maine is close to Debec, some 125 km north-west of St. Stephen. In June 1867, a few weeks before the Constitution Act, 1867 came into effect, the Legislature of New Brunswick passed an Act incorporating the Houlton Branch Railway Company, authorising it to build a railway from Debec to the international border with the United States, connecting with Houlton.An Act to incorporate the Houlton Branch Railway Company, SNB 1867, c. 54, s. 1. The proposed branch line would also connect to the St. Andrews and Quebec Railway, which eventually became the New Brunswick and Canada Railway. In 1870, the town of Houlton offered a bonus of $30,000 to any company which would build a railway connecting Houlton with the terminus of the New Brunswick and Canada Railway near Debec, to be completed by the end of 1872. The Houlton Branch Railway Company was prepared to build the railway, on condition that the town of St. Stephen also pay a bonus of $15,000. The proposed railway would not extend to St. Stephen, but would connect to existing railways which connected to St. Stephen.Dow v. Black, p. 4 (UKPC), p. 279 (AC). The New Brunswick Legislature then passed an Act authorising the county of Charlotte to issue debentures to raise the $15,000, to be paid by municipal assessments on the real and personal property of the inhabitants of St. Stephen,An Act to authorize the issuing of debentures on the credit of the lower district of the parish of St. Stephen, SNB 1870, c. 47, Preamble. provided a majority of two-thirds of the ratepayers of St. Stephen approved the debenture. After the Act was passed, on August 11, 1870 there was a meeting of the ratepayers of St. Stephen, as required by the statute. A majority voted in favour of the proposal and the County of Charlotte issued the debentures. The general sessions of the County of Charlotte then laid the necessary assessment on the residents of St. Stephen to pay the interest on the debentures.Dow v Black, p. 5 (UKPC), p. 279 (AC). Some residents of St. Stephen who opposed the debenture then challenged the assessment in the New Brunswick courts. The lead plaintiff was William T. Black, a local doctor,Rev. Isaac Case Knowlton, Annals of Calais, Maine and St. Stephen, New Brunswick; including the village of Milltown, Me., and the present town of Milltown, N.B. (Calais: J.A. Sears, 1875), pp. 116, 119. while the proponents of the debenture were represented by James Dow, the mayor of St. StephenJ. Gaudet, \\"Charlotte County Government\\" (Heritage Charlotte, 2005; revised, 2018, v.7.1), p.42. and editor of the St. Stephen Journal.Annals, p. 133. Decision of the New Brunswick Supreme Court  Summary  The challenge was brought by way of an application for certiorari in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick to quash the warrant of assessment, on the grounds that the provincial Act related to a railway extending beyond the limits of the Province and was therefore not within the constitutional authority of the Legislature of New Brunswick. In Trinity term 1872, the Supreme Court granted an interim rule nisi to quash the warrant of assessment. In the fall of 1872, the Supreme Court heard argument and reserved judgment on whether to confirm that initial decision. On February 22, 1873, in a 3-1 decision the Court held that the Act was unconstitutional and granted a rule absolute to quash the warrant of assessment.The Queen v. Dow (1873), 14 NBR 300 (NB SC), at pp. 300-301, 313, 1 Cart BNA 108, at pp. 108-109, 113. Majority decision of Justice Allen Justice John Campbell Allen, whose judgement was overturned by the Judicial Committee. Mr. Justice Allen delivered the majority decision of the Court. He held that there was no doubt that the railway extended beyond the province of New Brunswick, and therefore fell under exclusive federal jurisdiction under the combined effect of s. 92(10)(a) and s. 91(29) of the Constitution Act, 1867. Since the purpose of the provincial statute was to provide for the construction and completion of a railway extending beyond the limits of the province, it fell within federal jurisdiction. The funds were necessary to the completion of the railway. If the act were within provincial jurisdiction, the Province would have the power to secure the existence or completion of inter-jurisdictional undertakings.The Queen v. Dow, at pp. 307-309 (NBR), at pp. 112-113 (Cart). Dissenting opinion of Justice Fisher Charles Fisher, whose dissenting judgement was upheld by the Judicial Committee. Mr. Justice Fisher dissented. Prior to his appointment to the court, he had been a Father of Confederation and participated in both the Quebec Conference and the London Conference which had produced the terms of Confederation and the text of the Constitution Act, 1867. He distinguished between the pre-Confederation New Brunswick statute which incorporated the railway company and the subsequent statute authorising the town of St. Stephen to contribute to the financing of the railway. The pre-Confederation statute remained in force by virtue of s. 129 of the Constitution Act, 1867. That statute was the authority for the construction of the railway. The subsequent statute simply provided a way for the inhabitants of St. Stephen to contribute to the construction of that portion of the railway which was within New Brunswick. In his opinion, that financial arrangement was a purely local matter and therefore would be within provincial jurisdiction. He would have ruled the statute was constitutional.The Queen v. Dow, at pp. 312-313 (NBR), at pp. 115-116 (Cart). Decision of the Judicial Committee The supporters of the railway proposal then appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for Canada within the British Empire. (The Supreme Court of Canada had not yet been created.) Judah P. Benjamin, Q.C., and William Grantham acted for the appellants. Edward Fry, Q.C., and Mr Bompas acted for the respondents. On March 5, 1875, the Judicial Committee allowed the appeal, ruling that the New Brunswick Act was within provincial authority. Sir James W. Colvile wrote the decision for the Committee. He held that the provincial Act did not relate to inter-provincial railways, a subject matter reserved to the federal Parliament by s. 91(29) and 92(10) of the Constitution Act, 1867. It was true that the railway company itself had been incorporated by an Act of the New Brunswick Legislature, shortly before the Constitution Act, 1867 came into force.Dow v. Black, at pp. 277-278 (AC), pp. 2-3 (UKPC). However, the taxation statute in issue in the appeal did not relate to the construction of the railway, nor did it any way affect the corporate structure of the railway company. It simply enabled the majority of the inhabitants of the parish of St. Stephen to raise a subsidy for the railway by local taxation.Dow v. Black, at p. 281 (AC), pp. 7-8 (UKPC). The Committee also rejected a second argument, namely that the taxation powers of the province were restricted to general powers to tax throughout the province and could not be used to authorise taxes for a local municipal purpose. The Province's taxation powers under s. 92(2) of the Constitution Act, 1867 are not so limited. Alternatively, even if the tax did not fall within s. 92(2), it would clearly be a law of a local or private nature within the meaning of s. 92(16) of the Constitution Act, 1867, and therefore within provincial authority on that basis.Dow v. Black, at p. 282 (AC), pp. 8-9 (UKPC).

Pedro V High School (ESDPV - ) is a public high school located in Lisbon, Portugal. History General The King D. Pedro V, son of the Queen D. Maria II, with the cognomen ‚ÄúThe Educator‚Äù, had an impeccable and well- thought-out education. He rises to the throne at 18 years of age but spends the previous two years travelling abroad to complete his education. His reign was short, lasting only six years, but in that period he managed to bring a new dynamism to the Portuguese life. He devoted a large share of his time to problems related to education, which he considered crucial for the progress of the country. He was considered a modern man for his ideas about education were well beyond his time. In a letter written to the Minister of the Realm in 1860, D. Pedro V argues that the ‚Äúreduction of the importance of the final exams constitutes an improvement that I would like to see extended to the superior education‚Äù. He also states that ‚Äúthe current legislation demands the justification of absence. This subject has been considered under the disciplinary point of view, wouldn‚Äôt it be more rational to consider it by the influence that the absences can have on the students‚Äô grades?‚Äù. These thoughts and doubts can be deemed very current since the Portuguese educational system is far from perfect and are in need of people with vision for the future. Thus, in the school year of 1969/70,\\"Five Star Brass Band helps D. Pedro V High School celebrate its 42nd Anniversary\\"; Embassy of the United States in Portugal, 26 January 2011 the Liceu Nacional D. Pedro V (National High School D.Pedro V) was inaugurated in his homage through the School Construction Plan. This high school, much like the man it is named after, as always been innovative, being also the first high school in Lisbon to adopt the pedagogic model of coeducation.\\"D. Pedro V: Uma escola com hist√≥ria\\" (\\"D. Pedro V: A school with history); Junta de Freguesia da Nossa Senhora de F√°tima, March 2004 Today, the school is very different. More modern and better equipped, it includes four pavilions, physics, chemistry, biology and computer laboratories and a good resource center with library and computer room, always available for the 1300 students that attend it. This school continues to distinguish itself by its great theater tradition, which is rare in most Portuguese schools. It offers drama as part of its school program and has assembled a talented drama group. The Drama Group performs three shows per year to the public (school community), one for each term. The topics of the show match the tests made in other subjects and the students are assessed that way. Besides those presentations the group is already a necessary presence in national school meetings. Both the population and the government have understood the importance of education for the development and progress of the country, but King D. Pedro V was a visionary, understanding this in the 19th century.

Haifa Group (Haifa) is the world pioneer in developing and supplying Potassium Nitrate and Specialty Plant Nutrients for advanced agriculture in various climates, weather and soil conditions. Haifa also manufactures Controlled Release Fertilizers (CRF) for agriculture, horticulture, ornamentals and turf. Haifa's products are used on high-value crops such as fruit trees and vegetables. Many of Haifa's fertilizers can be used as a fertilizer solution that is applied through drip irrigation. This latter application is the principal driver of demand today, now that more countries are turning to controlled irrigation systems that make more efficient use of water.Potassium Chloride Ten Year Outlook 2011, CRU group  History  Haifa Group was founded in Israel in 1967 (original name was Haifa Chemicals Ltd.). The company's name is a tribute to the city of Haifa, where Haifa Group was established and where the company's headquarters have been located since then. Haifa Group was founded as a government-owned company with a mission to develop the natural resources of Potash in the Dead Sea area and the Negev region. The industrial value of Potash for agriculture uses was just uncovered. With innovative solutions as foliar feeding and side- dressing, water-soluble fertilizers (WSF), and controlled release fertilizers (CRF), Haifa Group revolutionized agriculture and influenced agriculture technologies. Today Haifa Group's global activities embrace agriculture societies in 5 continents and in more than 100 countries. Haifa group includes 16 subsidiaries worldwide and production facilities in Israel, France, USA, and Canada. The annual turnover estimation is around $700 Million (2010). Since 1989 Haifa Group is owned by Trance Resource Inc. (TRI), An American Holding Company controlled by The Trump Group.  Influence on agriculture  Potassium, along with nitrogen and phosphorus, is one of the three essential plant macronutrients, and is taken up by crops from soils in relatively large amounts. The absence or low availability of Potassium results in death of the plant, or poor growth that is generally accompanied by visual deficiency symptoms. Some crop-specific deficiency symptoms associated with potassium: * Grain crops such as corn, sorghum and small grains have weak stalks accompanied by reduced gra in size and yield. * Cotton leaves turn reddish- brown, appear scorched, become bronze then black, and eventually fall off. Bolls are generally knotty, resulting in low quality fiber and poor yield. * Tomatoes exhibit uneven fruit ripening, poor texture and soft fruit. * The skin of stone fruits is distorted. The fruit is small and poor in quality. * Yield of forage crops is low, and quality is poorEssential Plant Nutrients: their presence in North Carolina soils and role in plant nutrition, http://www.ncagr.gov/agronomi/pdffiles/essnutr.pdf. Haifa is supplying about 30% of the global demand for Potassium Nitrate fertilizers. Farmers discovered the fertilizing powers of minerals hundreds of years ago, but it was the industrial manufacturing of fertilizing products that made these advantages reachable and affordable. Haifa is a pioneer in the chemical industry of agriculture solutions for leveraging crops ‚Äì vegetables, field corps, orchards, ornamentals, turf herbs and forestry. Using fertilizers requires changes in methodologies, routines and traditions that lead agriculture for centuries and millenniums. Haifa is influencing this conservative and traditional profession by distribution of knowledge. In fact, Haifa became a source of agriculture knowledge, data and experience for millions of agrarians and agronomists from around the world. In 2011 Haifa transferred the knowledge to the internet, free to everyone, and launched a professional network where people from the agricultural sector around the globe can share knowledge and experience.

The main church serving James Burton high-class mid 19th-century new town of St Leonards-on-Sea was designed by Burton himself just before his death, and it survived for more than a century despite being damaged by the cliff into which it was built; but one night during World War II, the sea-facing building was obliterated by a direct hit from a damaged V-1 \\"doodlebug\\" which had crossed the English Channel. The Gilbert Scott brothers' bold replacement church was ready in 1961, and along with a sister church at nearby Bulverhythe it continues to serve the parish of St Leonards-on-Sea, now part of the Hastings conurbation. English Heritage has listed the building at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. History and architecture Founding of St Leonards-on-Sea By the 12th century, Hastings on the English Channel coast was one of Sussex's largest and most important towns. The famous Battle of 1066 took place nearby; a castle was founded; the town operated its own mint; it was the leader of the Cinque Ports; and seven churches existed within its boundaries. The surrounding manors included Gensing, a large and attractive expanse of land running down from a forested valley on to flat agricultural land and a beach immediately west of the town. As Hastings recovered from an 18th-century slump and started to become fashionable and well patronised again in the early 19th century, speculative development was encouraged. James Burton, a builder and entrepreneur who later fathered the prominent architect Decimus Burton, saw the potential of the Gensing estate land, which was owned by the Eversfield baronets of Denne Park near Horsham, West Sussex. He bought a large section of this manor, including of seafront land, for ¬£7,800 in February 1828, and developed a carefully planned new town, St Leonards-on-Sea, on it. Residential, commercial and hotel development was rapid, especially after it was incorporated as a town by an Act of Parliament in 1832 (previously it had been run as a private enterprise by Burton), and the resort soon rivalled neighbouring Hastings in popularity. The resort took its name from the long vanished St Leonard's Church and its accompanying parish, which still existed in name. The church, on the site of the present Norman Road Methodist Church, was demolished \\"between 1404 and 1428\\"‚Äîone of several churches lost in the Hastings area in the medieval period. At various times it had belonged to an abbey in Rouen in France and to Harmondsworth Priory in Middlesex. One of Burton's first acts in planning the town was to find a site for a new parish church. Services were originally held in a house, number 36 Marina, and arranged by Burton's wife. In January 1830, Burton announced to the General Quarter Sessions that Anglican worship would take place at the town's Assembly Rooms on a temporary basis. This was followed by a statement that he sought to build a \\"chapel\\" and burial ground serving St Leonard's parish and the neighbouring parish of St Mary Magdalene. (This largely undeveloped area of land, east of St Leonard's parish, was named after some almshouses rather than an ancient church.) The first church Burton's chosen site for his church was in the west of the town, on top of the steep West Hill overlooking the town and the English Channel. Friends pointed out that it would be too far to climb, so he found a new site set back from Marina (the seafront road) between some rows of houses. To fit the church in, a large section of cliff had to be dug out. Originally the church was a proprietary chapel, built in accordance with an Act of Parliament; it was not consecrated for public use immediately, and the Bishop of Chichester had to grant temporary permission for public worship to take place. Burton asked Princess Sophia of Gloucester, who happened to be staying in St Leonards-on- Sea, to lay the foundation stone on 8 September 1831. Construction continued until late 1832, and the Bishop of Durham dedicated the church to St Leonard and consecrated it on 22 May 1834. Burton himself was the architect; it was the only church he ever designed. The church was set back from the seafront and built into the cliff behind. The present church (pictured) stands in the same position. The building, described as \\"a simple Gothic chapel\\", faced south towards the English Channel rather than adopting the standard eastward orientation. A stair-turreted bell tower topped with battlements and containing an entrance porch stood at the south end. The porch led to the nave, which lacked aisles but had a chancel arch leading to the chancel. A round window with tracery lit the north end of the church, and the side walls had lancet windows. A photograph dated 1910 shows diagonal buttresses to the tower, paired arched openings with louvres at the top of the tower, and pinnacles at the corners of the nave. Built of stone, it was closest in style to 15th-century Perpendicular (\\"Late\\") Gothic. From the beginning, St Leonard's Church was popular and fashionable. Two years before she became Queen, Princess Victoria attended services regularly in 1834‚Äì35, and a drawing by John Foulon at that time shows a large flag flying from the tower. A guidebook of 1831 noted that \\"its situation [under the cliff] will produce a most extraordinary and picturesque effect\\". The building displeased some people, though, including Sussex writer John Parry: he stated \\"it is to be regretted that the style and proportions are not on a grander scale ‚Äì it cannot fairly said to be worthy of [the town]\\". The church suffered structural problems almost immediately. In 1837, it was partly crushed when the cliff behind it collapsed: the chancel was destroyed and had to be rebuilt to smaller dimensions. (It originally measured and had a capacity of 800, of which 320 sittings were free and not subject to pew rents.) The whole church was in danger of destruction, but the reconstruction work saved it. Later that year, the church received its first organ, partly paid for by Queen Adelaide. One source indicates that John Billing \\"extensively renovated\\" the church in 1861‚Äì62, although he is known to have been undertaking similar work during those years at St Leonard's Church in Seaford, East Sussex. A new parish, consisting of parts of the ancient parishes St Leonard's and St Mary Magdalene's, was created for the church in 1868. Thereafter the church was officially a parish church and had its own rector. Destruction in 1944 When World War II broke out, Hastings and St Leonards-on-Sea were considered vulnerable to attacks and invasion from abroad. They became a \\"restricted area\\" in 1940, and substantial defences were built on the seafront and elsewhere. Bombing raids and V-1 flying bombs (\\"doodlebugs\\") were experienced frequently. On the night of 29 July 1944, a Saturday, a doodlebug was hit over the English Channel. Damaged, it nevertheless continued to fly towards the coastline of St Leonards-on-Sea. It was approaching Marine Court‚Äîa recently built Art Deco block of flats which was hosting a servicemen's party‚Äîbut it veered and crashed in front of the doors of St Leonard's Church, making a deep crater. The tower fell into this, and the rest of the church was brought down as well. Although there were no casualties, the church was completely destroyed. Although the problem of rock falls and subsidence associated with the cliffs had continued throughout the life of the church, the War Damage Commission would only pay for it to be rebuilt on the same site. The architectural partnership of brothers Giles and Adrian Gilbert Scott were commissioned to design the new building. Reconstruction The church is built into the cliff behind. The Gilbert Scotts already had several postwar churches and unexecuted schemes to their name, individually or jointly. They generally worked in a \\"simplified modernistic Gothic Revival\\" style, which was their chosen motif for St Leonard's Church. Giles Gilbert Scott's proposal for the rebuilding of war-damaged Coventry Cathedral (1946‚Äì47) and his brother's work on the St Mary and St Joseph's Church on the Lansbury Estate in east London (1950‚Äì54), both based on a series of parabolic arches, informed their work at St Leonards-on-Sea: the design theme was used both inside and out. Adrian was principally responsible for the design, and construction began in October 1953. The building was ready to be opened for worship in April 1955, although it lacked the intended south tower: this was added in 1960‚Äì61 and the church was reopened. Adrian Gilbert Scott was apparently inspired by the unusual sea-facing site (the church is the only one on England's south coast to have a direct, uninterrupted sea view from its entrance): he stated \\"no architect could wish for a more romantic or inspiring site on which to build a church\\". More landslips from the cliff occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, and defences had to be built around the church; in 2000, the building's future was said to be uncertain, and closure was considered. More damage was caused by an electrical fire on Christmas Day 2003. The church is built of pale buff- coloured brick and cream-coloured stone. The roof over the nave and chancel is shallow with deep eaves and is laid with pantiles. A \\"fine blocky Gothic tower\\", elevated above the road and with a staircase in front, dominates the fa√ßade; it has a series of parabolic arches forming recesses. These have Perpendicular Gothic mouldings. The church has a simple north‚Äìsouth plan like its predecessor (the Gilbert Scotts changed to this layout after an earlier, more complex plan was considered too expensive). Recessed into the tower are three straight-headed wooden double doors with triple windows above them and a tall, pointed-arched three-light lancet window above. Higher still is a clock and a giant window in the form of a cross, illuminated at night and used as a landmark by vessels in the English Channel. Inside, the nave has narrow aisles with vaults and internal buttresses, but the dominant feature is another set of parabolic arches which form \\"a giant arcade\\" as they lead the eye to the chancel and sanctuary and to the side walls. The walls have greenish-blue stonework set in a wave-like pattern; this motif was also found at the contemporary Lansbury Estate church. Other maritime themes include images of \\"locally caught skate and herring\\" as part of the loaves and fishes imagery on the marble floor of the sanctuary‚Äîdescribed as a \\"forceful\\" allegory. The rector of the church at the time of the bombing, Canon Cuthbert Griffiths, was responsible for the internal decoration: soon after the old church was destroyed he dreamed that Jesus was preaching to the church's congregation from a boat on the Sea of Galilee (). Soon afterwards, he travelled there, and in the village of Ein Gev he bought a boat whose prow had been converted into a pulpit. He arranged for it to be brought back on board a ship to be used in the new church. The Prince Line Shipping Company transported it on a vessel which was making its last voyage; the company presented the boat's binnacle to Canon Griffiths to use as a lectern. The church today St Ethelburga's Church, now part of the St Leonard's parish, was built in 1929. St Leonard's Church was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 25 September 1998; this defines it as a \\"nationally important\\" building of \\"special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 521 Grade II listed buildings, and 535 listed buildings of all grades, in the borough of Hastings. Few postwar buildings have this status: English Heritage states that \\"post-1945 buildings have to be exceptionally important to be listed\\", as the criteria become stricter the newer a building is. The church is part of a joint parish and benefice with St Ethelburga's Church in nearby Bulverhythe. This brown-brick building was designed in a simple Gothic Revival style in 1929 by John B. Mendham. A pinnacled Art Deco-style clock tower dominates the exterior. The parish boundaries are the English Channel coast to the south; to the west, Glyne Gap and the western boundary of the borough, almost to the Crowhurst Road; to the northeast, the railway line between Crowhurst and West St Leonards railway stations; then behind West Hill Road, Archery Road, Quarry Hill, Kenilworth Road and Gensing Road. The parish was reunited in 2009, 80 years after it was originally split to allow St Ethelburga's to become a separate parish church. The parish boundary had been Grosvenor Gardens. The advowson (patronage) is held by the Hyndman's Trustees, based in Sheffield. A service is held every Sunday at 10.30am. Holy Communion is given twice a month, and other styles of worship take place on the other Sundays of the month. Weekly Sunday services and fortnightly midweek prayer meetings are held at St Ethelburga's Church. Both churches are evangelical in outlook, and are members of the Evangelical Alliance. Typical attendance on Sundays across the two churches is 128. Owing to structural issues, the church was officially closed for worship in 2018.https://www.hastingsobserver.co.uk/news/church-in-st-leonards-to-mark- its-closure-with-service-1-8581915 See also *List of places of worship in Hastings References Notes Bibliography   Churches completed in 1961 Grade II listed churches in East Sussex Church of England church buildings in East Sussex Churches in Hastings 20th-century Church of England church buildings Adrian Gilbert Scott buildings Giles Gilbert Scott church buildings ","title":"St Leonard's Church, St Leonards-on-Sea"},{"id":"34216089","text":"There are a number risk factors for tuberculosis infection; worldwide the most important of these is HIV. Co-infection with HIV is a particular problem in Sub-Saharan Africa, due to the high incidence of HIV in these countries. Smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day increases the risk of TB by two to four times while silicosis increases the risk about 30 fold. Diabetes mellitus is also an important risk factor that is growing in importance in developing countries. Other disease states that increase the risk of developing tuberculosis are Hodgkin lymphoma, end-stage renal disease, chronic lung disease, malnutrition, and alcoholism. A person's genetics also play a role. Silicosis People with silicosis have an approximately 30-fold greater risk for developing TB. Silica particles irritate the respiratory system, causing immunogenic responses such as phagocytosis, which results in high lymphatic vessel deposits. It is probably this interference and blockage of macrophage function that increases the risk of tuberculosis. Persons with chronic kidney failure and also on hemodialysis have an increased risk. Given that silicosis greatly increases the risk of tuberculosis, more research about the effect of various indoor or outdoor air pollutants on the disease would be necessary. Some possible indoor sources of silica include paint, concrete, and Portland cement. Crystalline silica is found in concrete, masonry, sandstone, rock, paint, and other abrasives. The cutting, breaking, crushing, drilling, grinding, or abrasive blasting of these materials may produce fine silica dust. It can also be in soil, mortar, plaster, and shingles. Some drugs, including rheumatoid arthritis drugs that work by blocking tumor necrosis factor-alpha (an inflammation-causingcytokine), raise the risk of activating a latent infection due to the importance of this cytokine in the immune defense against TB. HIV HIV is a major risk factor for tuberculosis. The risk of developing TB is estimated to be between 20-37 times greater in people living with HIV than among those without HIV infection. TB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. In 2009, there were 9.4 million new cases of TB, of which 1.2 (13%) million were among people living with HIV. Of the 1.7 million people who died of TB, 400,000 (24%) were living with HIV. Nutrition Low body weight is associated with risk of tuberculosis. A body mass index (BMI) below 18.5 increases the risk by 2 to 3 times. An increase in body weight lowers the risk. People with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of contracting tuberculosis, and they have a poorer response to treatment, possibly due to poorer drug absorption. Other clinical conditions that have been associated with active TB include gastrectomy with attendant weight loss and malabsorption, jejunoileal bypass, renal and cardiac transplantation, carcinoma of the head or neck, and other neoplasms (e.g., lung cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia). Diet may also modulate risk. For example, among immigrants in London from the Indian subcontinent, vegetarian Hindu Asians were found to have an 8.5 fold increased risk of tuberculosis, compared to Muslims who ate meat and fish daily. Although a causal link is not proved by this data, this increased risk could be caused by micronutrient deficiencies: possibly iron, vitamin B12 or vitamin D. Further studies have provided more evidence of a link between vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of contracting tuberculosis. Globally, the severe malnutrition common in parts of the developing world causes a large increase in the risk of developing active tuberculosis, due to its damaging effects on the immune system. Along with overcrowding, poor nutrition may contribute to the strong link observed between tuberculosis and poverty. Crowding Prisoners are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and TB. Imprisonment facilities provide conditions that allow TB to spread rapidly due to overcrowding, poor nutrition, and a lack of health services. TB outbreaks have been reported in prisons and jails throughout the world, and is particularly concerning in the United States, which incarcerates a larger proportion of its population than any other nation. The prevalence of TB in prisons is much higher than among the general population‚Äîin some countries as much as 40 times higher. Diabetes mellitus There is also a very high 3 fold increased risk of infection with TB for patients who have diabetes mellitus.Harries, A. D., et al. \\"Defining the Research Agenda to Reduce the Joint Burden of Disease from Diabetes Mellitus and Tuberculosis \\" Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH (2010) Web. Higher associations have been found between diabetes mellitus and TB in study populations from Central America, Europe, and Asia. Developing countries with exponential economic growth such as India and China that account for 40% of incident TB cases in 2010 and are estimated to have a 69% increase in people with diabetes mellitus are of concern for the joint burden of disease between diabetes mellitus and tuberculosis. The correlation between diabetes mellitus and TB concerns public health as it merges communicable and non-communicable diseases. Other Other conditions that increase risk include the sharing of needles among IV drug users, recent TB infection or a history of inadequately treated TB, chest X-ray suggestive of previous TB, showing fibrotic lesions and nodules, prolonged corticosteroid therapy and other immunosuppressive therapy, compromised immune system (30‚Äì40% of people with AIDS worldwide also have TB), hematologic and reticuloendothelial diseases, such as leukemia and Hodgkin's disease, end-stage kidney disease, intestinal bypass, chronic malabsorption syndromes, vitamin D deficiency, and low body weight. There is also genetic susceptibility.

It is both driven by and drives the popular culture of mainstream media. Urban pop culture tends to be more cosmopolitan and liberal than mainstream culture, but is not without its own complex mores, reflecting, for example, the parent societies' ambivalence to sexuality. Impact on popular media The impact on traditional popular media is more evident today than it has ever been. Since 1995, the number of nationally aired television commercials and popular sitcoms that use props, references, or slang from Inner cities continues to grow. Big screen movies are also other examples of how urban pop culture is impacting traditional pop culture. The hit movie Tropic Thunder is filled with references, images, and jokes that are common amongst the youth in Brooklyn, New York and Los Angeles California. Urban pop culture has also infiltrated the mainstream world of fashion, music, and even politics. During an interview former president George W. Bush was asked how he felt about a comment rapper Kanye West made about his administration's response efforts to Hurricane Katrina, and the former president included in his response that he was \\"not a hater\\"; a term that originated in New York City, and that is used mostly by rappers and youth.

He was a supporter of the Bohemian King George of Podƒõbrady and was taken prisoner by the anti-king Matthias Corvinus.  Life  Sigmund was a member of the Moravian noble Perstein family. His parents were John II of Pernstein and his first wife Barbara of Waldstein (). Like his father and his younger brother William, Sigmund supported the Bohemian King George of Podƒõbrady. Around the middle 1460s, his father transferred Zub≈°tejn Castle and the associated Lordship to him. In 1467, he was taken prisoner by the Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus, who wanted to gain the crown of Bohemia. He and John of Koschumberg were taken to Brno and held there. It is not known when he was released. However, his daughter Dorothea was born in 1470, suggesting that he was released no later than 1469. In early 1470, he was again taken prisoner. This time, he was held by Zdenƒõk Konopi≈°≈•sk√Ω of Sternberg, the leader of the Zelen√° Hora Alliance at his residende in Poln√°. Sigmunds father and his brother William tried to achieve Sigmund's release. They failed, however, even after George of Podƒõbrady died in 1471. They supporte the newly elected king Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary, who granted them certain rights over the monastery at Oslavany and the Porta coeli Convent at Ti≈°nov in 1471 and 1472. They provided money for Sigmund's release. Matthias Corvinus, however, demanded that Sigmund change over to his side in the conflict, and probably also that Sigmund convert to Catholicism.Conversion of famous people Corvinus's advisor, the later bishop John Filipec, was committed to negotiating Sigmund's release. On 14 November 1472 in Sopron, William signed an agreement, under which Sigmund should be released not later than 2 February 1473. Sigmund's health was probably undermined by his captivity and he did not enjoy his regained freedom for long. He died in 1473 or later. His widow Elizabeth of Boskowitz received Zub≈°tejn Castle as her widow seat. She continued to live there with her young daughters. In 1473, she remarried with Linhard of Guttenstein () and Zub≈°tejn fell back to her first father-in-law John II of Pernstein.  Marriage and issue  Sigmund married twice. His first wife was named Elizabeth (); nothing is known about her background. With her, he had a daughter: * Bohunka (died after 1478) Sigmund married his second wife in 1437. She was Elizabeth of Boskowitz ().
