Zambīia reigned for 3 years. He was a contemporary of Sin-iqišam king of Larsa, whose fifth and final year- name celebrates his victory over Zambīia: “year the army of (the land of) Elam (and Zambīia (the king of Isin),) was/were defeated by arms,” suggesting a confederation between Isin and Elam against Larsa. The city of Nippur was hotly contested between the city-states. If Zambīia survived this battle, he may have possibly gone on to be contemporary with Sin-iqišam’s successors, Ṣilli-Adad and Warad-Sin.

The following is the extension in matrix setting. Consider a finite adapted sequence \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{X}_k\\\\\\\\} of self-adjoint matrices with dimension d, and a fixed sequence \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{A}_k\\\\\\\\} of self-adjoint matrices that satisfy : \\\\mathbb{E}_{k-1}\\\\,\\\\mathbf{X}_k = \\\\mathbf{0} \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{X}_k^2 \\\\preceq \\\\mathbf{A}_k^2 almost surely. Compute the variance parameter : \\\\sigma^2 = \\\\bigg\\\\Vert \\\\sum_k \\\\mathbf{A}^2_k \\\\bigg\\\\Vert.

One case occurs when each summand \\\\mathbf{X}_k is conditionally symmetric. Another example requires the assumption that \\\\mathbf{X}_k commutes almost surely with \\\\mathbf{A}_k . Matrix Hoeffding Placing addition assumption that the summands in Matrix Azuma are independent gives a matrix extension of Hoeffding's inequalities. Consider a finite sequence \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{X}_k\\\\\\\\} of independent, random, self-adjoint matrices with dimension d, and let \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{A}_k\\\\\\\\} be a sequence of fixed self-adjoint matrices. Assume that each random matrix satisfies : \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\,\\\\mathbf{X}_k = \\\\mathbf{0} \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{X}_k^2 \\\\preceq \\\\mathbf{A}_k^2 almost surely.

Matrix bounded difference (McDiarmid) In scalar setting, McDiarmid's inequality provides one common way of bounding the differences by applying Azuma's inequality to a Doob martingale. A version of the bounded differences inequality holds in the matrix setting. Let \\\\\\\\{Z_k:k=1,2,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\} be an independent, family of random variables, and let \\\\mathbf{H} be a function that maps n variables to a self-adjoint matrix of dimension d. Consider a sequence \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{A}_k\\\\\\\\} of fixed self-adjoint matrices that satisfy : \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{H}(z_1,\\\\ldots,z_k,\\\\ldots,z_n) - \\\\mathbf{H}(z_1,\\\\ldots,z'_k,\\\\ldots,z_n) \\\\right)^2 \\\\preceq \\\\mathbf{A}_k^2, where z_i and z'_i range over all possible values of Z_i for each index i. Compute the variance parameter : \\\\sigma^2 = \\\\bigg\\\\Vert \\\\sum_k \\\\mathbf{A}^2_k \\\\bigg\\\\Vert. Then, for all t \\\\geq 0 : \\\\Pr \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\lambda_{\\\\text{max}} \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{H}(\\\\mathbf{z}) - \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\,\\\\mathbf{H}(\\\\mathbf{z}) \\\\right) \\\\geq t \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\leq d \\\\cdot e^{-t^2/8\\\\sigma^2}, where \\\\mathbf{z}=(Z_1,\\\\ldots,Z_n). An improvement of this result was established in (see also ): for all t \\\\geq 0 : \\\\Pr \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\lambda_{\\\\text{max}} \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{H}(\\\\mathbf{z}) - \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\,\\\\mathbf{H}(\\\\mathbf{z}) \\\\right) \\\\geq t \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\leq d \\\\cdot e^{-t^2/\\\\sigma^2}, where \\\\mathbf{z}=(Z_1,\\\\ldots,Z_n) and \\\\sigma^2 = \\\\bigg\\\\Vert \\\\sum_k \\\\mathbf{A}^2_k \\\\bigg\\\\Vert. Survey of related theorems The first bounds of this type were derived by . Recall the theorem above for self-adjoint matrix Gaussian and Rademacher bounds: For a finite sequence \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{A}_k\\\\\\\\} of fixed, self-adjoint matrices with dimension d and for \\\\\\\\{\\\\xi_k\\\\\\\\} a finite sequence of independent standard normal or independent Rademacher random variables, then : \\\\Pr \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\lambda_{\\\\text{max}} \\\\left( \\\\sum_k \\\\xi_k \\\\mathbf{A}_k \\\\right) \\\\geq t \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\leq d \\\\cdot e^{-t^2/2\\\\sigma^2} where : \\\\sigma^2 = \\\\bigg\\\\Vert \\\\sum_k \\\\mathbf{A}^2_k \\\\bigg\\\\Vert. Ahlswede and Winter would give the same result, except with : \\\\sigma_{AW}^2 = \\\\sum_k \\\\lambda_\\\\max \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A}_k^2 \\\\right ) . By comparison, the \\\\sigma^2 in the theorem above commutes \\\\Sigma and \\\\lambda_\\\\max; that is, it is the largest eigenvalue of the sum rather than the sum of the largest eigenvalues. It is never larger than the Ahlswede–Winter value (by the norm triangle inequality), but can be much smaller. Therefore, the theorem above gives a tighter bound than the Ahlswede–Winter result. The chief contribution of was the extension of the Laplace-transform method used to prove the scalar Chernoff bound (see Chernoff bound#Theorem for additive form (absolute error)) to the case of self-adjoint matrices. The procedure given in the derivation below. All of the recent works on this topic follow this same procedure, and the chief differences follow from subsequent steps. Ahlswede & Winter use the Golden–Thompson inequality to proceed, whereas Tropp uses Lieb's Theorem. Suppose one wished to vary the length of the series (n) and the dimensions of the matrices (d) while keeping the right-hand side approximately constant. Then n must vary approximately as the log of d. Several papers have attempted to establish a bound without a dependence on dimensions. Rudelson and Vershynin give a result for matrices which are the outer product of two vectors. provide a result without the dimensional dependence for low rank matrices. The original result was derived independently from the Ahlswede–Winter approach, but proves a similar result using the Ahlswede–Winter approach. Finally, Oliveira proves a result for matrix martingales independently from the Ahlswede–Winter framework. Tropp slightly improves on the result using the Ahlswede–Winter framework. Neither result is presented in this article. Derivation and proof Ahlswede and Winter The Laplace transform argument found in is a significant result in its own right: Let \\\\mathbf{Y} be a random self-adjoint matrix. Then : \\\\Pr \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\lambda_{\\\\max} ( Y ) \\\\geq t \\\\right \\\\\\\\} \\\\leq \\\\inf_{\\\\theta > 0} \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ e^{-\\\\theta t } \\\\cdot \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left [ \\\\operatorname{tr} e^{\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{Y}} \\\\right ] \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. To prove this, fix \\\\theta > 0. Then : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Pr \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\lambda_{\\\\max} (\\\\mathbf{Y}) \\\\geq t \\\\right \\\\\\\\} &= \\\\Pr \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\lambda_{\\\\max} (\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta Y}) \\\\geq \\\\theta t \\\\right \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\Pr \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ e^{\\\\lambda_{\\\\max} (\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{Y})} \\\\geq e^{\\\\theta t} \\\\right \\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\leq e^{-\\\\theta t} \\\\operatorname{E} e^{\\\\lambda_{\\\\max} (\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{Y})}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\leq e^{-\\\\theta t} \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\operatorname{tr} e^{(\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{Y})} \\\\end{align} The second-to-last inequality is Markov's inequality. The last inequality holds since e^{\\\\lambda_{\\\\max} \\\\theta \\\\mathbf{Y}} = \\\\lambda_{\\\\max} e^{\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{Y}} \\\\leq \\\\operatorname{tr} e^{\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{Y}}. Since the left-most quantity is independent of \\\\theta, the infimum over \\\\theta>0 remains an upper bound for it. Thus, our task is to understand \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\operatorname{tr} e^{\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{Y}} Nevertheless, since trace and expectation are both linear, we can commute them, so it is sufficient to consider \\\\operatorname{E} e^{\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{Y}} := \\\\mathbf{M}_\\\\mathbf{Y}(\\\\theta), which we call the matrix generating function. This is where the methods of and diverge. The immediately following presentation follows . The Golden–Thompson inequality implies that : \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\mathbf{M}_{\\\\mathbf{X}_1 + \\\\mathbf{X}_2}(\\\\theta) \\\\leq \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\left [ \\\\left ( \\\\operatorname{E} e^{\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{X}_1} \\\\right ) \\\\left ( \\\\operatorname{E} e^{\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{X}_2} \\\\right ) \\\\right ] = \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\mathbf{M}_{\\\\mathbf{X}_1} (\\\\theta) \\\\mathbf{M}_{\\\\mathbf{X}_2}(\\\\theta) , where we used the linearity of expectation several times. Suppose \\\\mathbf{Y} = \\\\sum_k \\\\mathbf{X}_k. We can find an upper bound for \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\mathbf{M}_{\\\\mathbf{Y}} (\\\\theta) by iterating this result. Noting that \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\mathbf{AB}) \\\\leq \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\mathbf{A}) \\\\lambda_{\\\\max}(\\\\mathbf{B}), then : \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\mathbf{M}_\\\\mathbf{Y} (\\\\theta) \\\\leq \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\left [ \\\\left ( \\\\operatorname{E} e^{\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\\\theta \\\\mathbf{X}_k} \\\\right ) \\\\left( \\\\operatorname{E} e^{\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{X}_n} \\\\right ) \\\\right ] \\\\leq \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\left ( \\\\operatorname{E} e^{\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\\\theta \\\\mathbf{X}_k} \\\\right ) \\\\lambda_{\\\\max} ( \\\\operatorname{E} e^{\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{X}_n}). Iterating this, we get : \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\mathbf{M}_\\\\mathbf{Y} (\\\\theta) \\\\leq (\\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\mathbf{I}) \\\\left [ \\\\Pi_k \\\\lambda_{\\\\max} (\\\\operatorname{E} e^{\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{X}_k}) \\\\right ] = d e^{\\\\sum_k \\\\lambda_\\\\max \\\\left ( \\\\log \\\\operatorname{E} e^{\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{X}_k} \\\\right ) } So far we have found a bound with an infimum over \\\\theta. In turn, this can be bounded. At any rate, one can see how the Ahlswede–Winter bound arises as the sum of largest eigenvalues. Tropp The major contribution of is the application of Lieb's theorem where had applied the Golden–Thompson inequality. Tropp's corollary is the following: If H is a fixed self-adjoint matrix and X is a random self-adjoint matrix, then : \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\operatorname{tr} e^{\\\\mathbf{H}+\\\\mathbf{X}} \\\\leq \\\\operatorname{tr} e^{\\\\mathbf{H} + \\\\log( \\\\operatorname{E} e^{\\\\mathbf{X} })} Proof: Let \\\\mathbf{Y} = e^\\\\mathbf{X}. Then Lieb's theorem tells us that : f(\\\\mathbf{Y}) = \\\\operatorname{tr} e^{\\\\mathbf{H} + \\\\log(\\\\mathbf{Y})} is concave. The final step is to use Jensen's inequality to move the expectation inside the function: : \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\operatorname{tr} e^{\\\\mathbf{H} + \\\\log(\\\\mathbf{Y})} \\\\leq \\\\operatorname{tr} e^{\\\\mathbf{H} + \\\\log(\\\\operatorname{E} \\\\mathbf{Y})}. This gives us the major result of the paper: the subadditivity of the log of the matrix generating function. =Subadditivity of log mgf= Let \\\\mathbf{X}_k be a finite sequence of independent, random self-adjoint matrices. Then for all \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}, : \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\mathbf{M}_{\\\\sum_k \\\\mathbf{X}_k} (\\\\theta) \\\\leq \\\\operatorname{tr} e^{\\\\sum_k \\\\log \\\\mathbf{M}_{\\\\mathbf{X}_k} (\\\\theta)} Proof: It is sufficient to let \\\\theta=1. Expanding the definitions, we need to show that : \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\operatorname{tr} e^{\\\\sum_k \\\\theta \\\\mathbf{X}_k } \\\\leq \\\\operatorname{tr} e^{\\\\sum_k \\\\log \\\\operatorname{E} e^{\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{X}_k} }. To complete the proof, we use the law of total expectation. Let \\\\operatorname{E}_k be the expectation conditioned on \\\\mathbf{X}_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\mathbf{X}_k .

It was founded in 2012, and is the only FTSE 100 company in the UK to design and deliver degrees. The institution is officially separated into two subdivisions - Pearson Business School, which offers business-related degrees and degree apprenticeships, and Escape Studios, a visual effects academy Pearson plc acquired in 2013 which offers degrees and short courses in the creative arts ranging from VFX to Game Art and Animation. History The creation of Pearson College London was announced in July 2011. Pearson College London launched its first degree programme in September 2012. In August 2013 it was announced that Pearson College London would begin offering business degrees validated by Ashridge Business School, whilst continuing with its partnership with Royal Holloway. In October 2013 Pearson College London acquired Escape Studios, Europe's leading VFX academy. Escape Studios now also offers courses in VFX, Games and Animation at undergraduate, postgraduate and short course levels. All degrees are currently awarded by a third party institute, most notably Business degrees are awarded by the University of Kent, but the college is in the process of getting their own degree awarding power from the relevant Government body. In the past couple of years the size of the college has rapidly increased and currently it has approximately 1300 student (2019). The college directly employs a minor amount of academic staff, most lecturers are on a short term contract only working a couple of days a week in the rest of their time they usually work in the field of their expertise. This allows them to bring their experience into the classroom and work on real life case studies. Due to the lack of full time academics, the college very rarely publishes academic papers. Location Students of Pearson College London primarily study at Pearson's offices in London at 190 High Holborn. The first three floors is solely occupied by the University, and have been transformed to cater for their needs. Due to the limited space in the building, there is no library, but student are offered cards for the Central Library. The size of the College is still relatively small, but with further increase in the number of student, more floors of the Person office building are likely to be re-purposed. Admissions Entry requirements vary depending upon the chosen course and level of study (undergraduate, postgraduate or short courses). Applicants are also required to attend a workshop day including an interview and an aptitude test. Courses usually cost £9000, but by attending the workshop, there is a £3000 fee waiver awarded to most students. Most student pay their fees, by applying for a student finance, but for private colleges, such as Person College, the maximum available finance is capped at £6000. The college does not have its own accommodation, student normally are privately renting or staying in privately owned students halls most noticeably Tunfell House and Felda House near Wembley Park. Courses Pearson College London offers undergraduate and postgraduate degrees and a range of short courses. The courses cover Accounting, Business, Enterprise, Law, Computer Animation, Video Games and Visual Effects. Courses can be studied full-time or part-time, depending on which course is chosen. The degree programmes are validated by the University of Kent. All of the degrees are designed, developed and delivered with industry partners including Direct Line Group, Sony Pictures Entertainment, WPP plc, Lotus F1, BT Group, Lloyd's of London, Savills and L'Oreal. Industry partners within VFX, Games and Animation include Framestore, The Mill, Moving Picture Company (MPC), BlueBolt, Electric Theatre, Milk and Jellyfish Pictures.Pearson College Person College also offers a wide variety of degree apprenticeships, where student work four days a week at one of the industry partners, then attend university one day a week. This schemes are usually free, and student get a wage from the company they work for. The college has September and January intakes, but this can vary; full-time degree courses usually last 3 years, but student with exceptional academic standards are offered to take a 2 year accelerated course.

Four years later, the Supreme Court overturned its previous ruling, and in 1976, capital punishment was again legalized in the United States. , three states have laws that specify hanging as an available secondary method of execution.  Colonial America  Hanging was one method of execution in Colonial America. According to the Espy file, Daniel Frank was hanged in 1623 for cattle theft in the Jamestown colony. John Billington is thought to be one of the first men to be hanged in New England; Billington was convicted of murder in September 1630 after he shot and killed John Newcomen. Execution of Ann Hibbins on Boston Common, June 19, 1656. Sketch by F.T. Merril, 1886 During the Salem witch trials of the early 1690s, most of the men and women convicted of witchcraft were sentenced to public hanging. It is estimated that seventeen women and two men were hanged as a result of the trials. However, modern scholars maintain that thousands of individuals were hanged for witchcraft throughout the American colonies. Hangings during the colonial era of America were mostly performed publicly in order to deter the behavior for which the criminals were hanged. Thousands of townspeople would gather around the gallows to hear a sermon and observe the hangings of convicted criminals. Such experiences were deemed to be good lessons on morality for the children and townspeople.  1776 – 1830  Following the American Revolution led by the Continental Congress and the subsequent ratification of the United States Constitution, the Bill of Rights was signed into law and became the first ten amendments to that constitution. The eighth amendment of the Bill of rights states that cruel and unusual punishment shall not be inflicted. During this time period, hanging was not considered to be cruel and unusual, yet almost two hundred years later, this amendment was key to the temporary suspension of capital punishment by the Supreme Court. Today, the eighth amendment is still an essential argument employed by those in favor of abolishing capital punishment. During this time of political unrest, some prominent members of society believed that capital punishment such as hanging ought to be abolished. One such man, Benjamin Rush, published a pamphlet in 1797 speaking out against the death penalty. In the pamphlet Rush often raises religious arguments such as, \\"The punishment of murder by death is contrary to reason, and to the order and happiness of society, and contrary to divine revelation.\\" Individuals like Benjamin Rush laid the foundation for death penalty abolition movements that are still carried on today. Hangings were common during the early part of the nineteenth century. Just as in Colonial America, hangings were still conducted in public for all to witness. However, unlike the colonial era, men and women were no longer hanged for offenses like adultery. In fact, by 1794 Pennsylvania only hanged criminals convicted of murder in the first degree. In New York, the number of capital crimes were brought down from nineteen to just two. By 1815, other states like Vermont, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, New Hampshire, and Ohio (with the slaves)also drastically decreased their number of capital offenses, usually lowering the number down to just two or three. Because of these changes in law, hangings began to decrease in some regions of the country. However, some states went in the opposite direction. Most of the southern states in addition to Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode Island actually raised their number of capital offenses.  1830 – 1920  Starting in the early 1830s, public hangings were considered by many to be cruel. Many others considered them a major community event and still others took to them as an opportunity to become unruly as with modern sporting events: \\"Sometimes tens of thousands of eager viewers would show up to view hangings; local merchants would sell souvenirs and alcohol. Fighting and pushing would often break out as people jockeyed for the best view of the hanging or the corpse! Onlookers often cursed the widow or the victim and would try to tear down the scaffold or the rope for keepsakes. Violence and drunkenness often ruled towns far into the night after 'justice had been served.\\" By 1835, five states – Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts – had enacted laws providing for private hangings. Fourteen years later in 1849, fifteen more states also enacted such laws. However, most opponents of hanging opposed these laws. These abolitionists believed that public execution would eventually lead the general population to cry out against the capital punishment, eventually putting an end to hanging in the United States. In 1862 President Abraham Lincoln sanctioned the hanging of 39 Sioux Indians convicted of murdering white settlers in Mankato, Minnesota. This mass execution remains the largest of its kind in United States history. Four people were hanged for their participation in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Mary Surratt, one of the four, was the first woman to receive capital punishment by the United States federal government.  The Wild West  As the United States began to expand west, most new states favored the death penalty, and hanging continued to be the most popular means of execution. In addition, disregarding the trend set by many northern states, these states would hang criminals for offenses like robbery and rape. Because of the abundant lawlessness and crime in the Wild West, judges were strict, and hangings were commonplace. If a judge was particularly ruthless, he became known as a hanging judge. Isaac Parker, perhaps the best-known hanging judge, sentenced 160 men to death by hanging. However, of those 160, only 79 were actually executed; the remaining 81 either appealed, died in jail, or were pardoned. Though at the time, these judges were criticized for issuing so many death sentences, a few modern scholars maintain that most of the judges were honorable men trying to establish law and order in the wild American frontier.  Lynching  After the American Civil War, the frontier opened up, and law lagged behind, with an undetermined number of local criminals suffering Lynching, or extrajudicial hanging. In the South, tensions arising from Reconstruction led to several lynchings. Scholars estimate that 4,742 total people, mostly male, were lynched from 1882 to 1968. About 3,445 of those individuals were African American and 1,297 were white.  The Electric Chair  Old Sparky, the electric chair used at Sing Sing prison In 1890, New York became the first state to use the electric chair as a means of execution. Though it took two surges of electricity lasting nearly two minutes to kill William Kemmler, the electric chair replaced hanging as the most efficient and preferred method of execution in the United States. This was the first time in United States history that a method other than hanging was the leading means of execution.  1921 – Present  Since the introduction of the electric chair in 1890, the number of hangings have steadily decreased. In 1936 Rainey Bethea was hanged after he was convicted of rape. Over 20,000 people came to Owensboro, Kentucky, to witness Bethea's execution. Many scholars maintain that the unprecedented nationwide attention and coverage the execution received caused the United States to outlaw public executions. Therefore, Bethea was the last individual to be hanged publicly in the United States. Since Bethea's execution, states had been eliminating hanging as means of execution altogether, until the death penalty was de facto suspended in the late 1960s. When the death penalty was restored in 1976, most states implemented lethal injection instead of hanging. Delaware's Billy Bailey was the last criminal to be hanged in the United States, in 1996. Bailey was just the third criminal to be hanged since 1965, the other two being Charles Rodman Campbell in 1994 and Westley Allan Dodd in 1993. , hanging is an available secondary method of execution in the states of Delaware, New Hampshire, and Washington.

The ERMS operates under the principles of a cap and trade market system. The ERMS applies only to stationary sources that produce over 10 tons of VOMs during a given compliance period. The compliance period lasts from the beginning of May to the end of September each year as this is the time period in which the air quality tends to be the lowest. The region managed by ERMS, referred to as a nonattainment area for its substandard ozone quality, encompasses the greater metropolitan area of Chicago. In total, the non-attainment area comprises six counties and three townships in the northeast corner of Illinois. Though the ERMS wasn’t fully operational until May 2000, the majority of sources were reporting emissions on schedule by 1998. The ERMS was created by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) in response to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Under the amendments, the Chicago metropolitan area was mandated to reduce ozone forming VOM emissions by 9% every 3 years from 1996 until the area reached attainment. Wishing to reduce emissions without imposing the economic burdens associated with the traditional command and control approach, The IEPA created this market-based system. The ERMS issues allotment trading units (ATUs) which are equivalent to an emission permit worth 200 pounds of VOM. Like most cap and trade programs, any source that exceeds its permitted emissions faces monetary penalties. Unlike similar programs, however, ATUs that go unused in a given season can be held by the emitter for a total of 2 years. The program also contains a failsafe for emitters called the Alternative Compliance Market Account (ACMA). This account exists as a seller of last resort in the event of an emitter being unable to purchase the required amount of ATUs on the open market. It has had minimal use in the 11 years of ERMS activity. Generally, the ERMS is considered a relatively small trading scheme. In the 2010 season, 234 sources participated in the system while 53 transactions were completed and 8740 ATUs were traded. The results of 11 years of operation by the ERMS are telling. The first seasons of operation saw the average ATU price drop from $75.87 to $18.75, or 25% of their initial value. Since then, the price has fluctuated modestly and ended at $20.10 in 2010. Furthermore, 58, 834 ATUs expired without use. This accounts for 58.6% of the total ATUs allotted in 2010. These figures point to an inherent lack of scarcity in the system. While numerous reasons have been put forth, they generally point to inflated baseline emissions and subsequent over-allotment. Ultimately, even if the ERMS cannot be considered an outright success, it provides a wealth of information for those wishing to emulate the plan. Representatives from the region of Tuscany, Italy and Santiago, Chile had been inquiring about the program as far back as 2004. Furthermore, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme has been plagued by similar outcomes. Still, supporters argue that reduction targets were met and in a much less costly manner than what would have occurred under command and control methods.

The objective of multicultural media in Canada is to create a voice for a community of a particular ethnic background, challenge social injustices, and foster cultural pride for minority and immigrant Canadians. Ethnic media do not always target new immigrants, though much of this particular media works to eliminate feelings of isolation in the dominant culture. Multicultural media also services Canadian-born individuals of a visible minority as well as diasporic ethnicities. Ultimately, multicultural media in Canada, whether it is delivered in English, French or the respective language of the culture, is to contribute to the cultural maintenance and ethnic cohesion of the culture in question but also help members of minorities to integrate into larger Canadian society. The third-language media are especially important for new immigrants, as they are usually the main source of information for those who have yet to become proficient in one of the official languages. Thus, third-language media provide crucial information on education, training, and job seeking for these immigrants. The promotion of multicultural media began in the late 1980s as the multicultural policy was legislated in 1988. In the Multiculturalism Act, the federal government proclaimed the recognition of the diversity of Canadian culture. Thus, multicultural media became an integral part of Canadian media overall. Upon numerous government reports showing lack of minority representation or minority misrepresentation, the Canadian government stressed separate provision be made to allow minorities and ethnicities of Canada to have their own voice in the media. Today ethnic media is available across Canada from small newspapers to full-fledged broadcasting stations run by the private sector, such as OMNI TV. Due to the difficulty of acquiring licensing and space on the electromagnetic spectrum due to costs and threshold of the spectrum itself, many ethnic cultures in Canada have third-language channels through satellite television. However, this still creates exclusion of minorities from mass media as found in Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission's review of the 1999 Ethnic Broadcasting Policy found technological access and financial constraints hindered many ethnic minorities from accessing specialty television. Policy and Legislation In 1971 Canada became the first country to introduce a Multiculturalism policy. By 1988, the policy became an act of Parliament known as the Multiculturalism Act. The act proclaimed the federal governments policy to recognize the diversity of cultures in Canadian society. It also provided the overall framework for management of ethnocultural and racial diversity in Canada. Similarly the Broadcasting Act of 1991 asserts the Canadian broadcasting system should reflect the diversity of cultures in the country. The CRTC is the governmental body which enforces the Broadcasting Act. The CRTC revised their Ethnic Broadcasting Policy in 1999 to go into the details on the conditions of the distribution of ethnic and multilingual programming. One of the conditions that this revision specified was the amount of ethnic programming needed in order to be awarded the ethnic broadcasting licence. According to the act, 60% of programming on a channel, whether on the radio or television, has to be considered ethnic in order to be approved for the licence under this policy. However, this quota does not specify which language this programming be in thus not considering the needs of the ethnic audiences. Media Radio In most major Canadian cities ethnic radio is available. Whether it is an ethnic designated time slot on a commercial station, on community or campus radio, or a 24-hour multilingual operation, ethnic radio is accessible. An example of the latter is CHIN radio. Created by Johnny Lombardi in 1966, CHIN radio has become the largest multicultural and multilingual radio station in Ontario. The station is delivers programming in more than 30 languages to 30 different cultural communities in the southern Ontario and Greater Toronto Area region. Have branched out to the Ottawa and Gatineau region, CHIN also delivers programming in 18 languages there as well. The success of the station can be credited to CHIN’s unique way in providing quantitative research about their audiences to advertisers. Using custom studies and current demographic records provides CHIN the accurate numbers behind their audiences, making advertisers support the ethnic broadcaster. Due to the success of CHIN, many companies have begun to specialize in ethnocentric demographic and lifestyle data to help predict not only the media preferences of ethnic audiences but also their spending habits. No longer merely relying on Statistics Canada for information on minorities in the nation gives a more of a well-rounded look at the complexities of Canadians of various cultural backgrounds. This information is crucial in perfecting how to market to ethnic audiences. Recently CHIN Radio has been reaching out to the official language speaking audiences. This includes the children of immigrants who grew up with English and French as their dominant language but want to learn more about their heritages traditional music, cuisine, and fashion. To reach to this segment of the population, CHIN has added a few English shows to their airwaves. CHIN also holds the popular CHIN Picnic every year to further attract non-ethnic listeners. Newspaper There are hundreds of ethnic newspapers available throughout the country. These papers have become increasingly more high-level in both the way they are run and the stories they cover. The larger dailies are Ming Pao, Sing Tao Daily, the World Journal (Chinese) and Corriere Canadese (Italian). Some other notable papers are Ghanaian News, a monthly newspaper that focuses on news relating to Ghanaian immigrants now living in Toronto or Montreal, the cities the paper is distributed in. Its contents mainly pertain to news from Ghana as well as news on Ghanaian Canadians. Mostly Ghanaian News stresses cultural retention and investing back into the home country. The Montreal Community Contact is another minority paper serving the Montreal black public. Founded in 1992 by Egbert Gaye, the Montreal Community Contact contains stories pertaining to all black regardless of country of origin (unlike Ghanaian News). Ninety per cent of the paper is devoted to issues confronting foreign and Canadian born black people in Montreal. The stories in the Montreal Community Contact go in-depth on issues concerning the black community. The paper also reports stories on small business started by members of the black community as well as successful black Canadians. However the paper does its best to not be biased as it also reports on conflict and crime within the community it serves. Ultimately however the Montreal Community Contact tries to promote a positive image of the black community. Television The role of ethnic television media is to provide informational programming, which pertains to the needs of the various cultural communities within Canada. The information provided by these programs gives these communities information that the mainstream media does not provide. Omni Television provides ethnic programming to cities in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta. Their programming is mostly produced in Canada with a few shows from the various diasporas. The television system's three stations are offered on basic cable and show 60 percent or more of their programming in 40 languages to 50 ethnocultural communities. Knowing the importance of appealing not only to recent immigrants but also to the second and third generation immigrants, Omni, along with the other Canadian ethnic television stations, have started to raise the quality of programming. These shows are much slicker and better produced than ethnic programs of the past. Furthermore, shows produced at Omni, such as Canadian Desi, understand the complexities of the minorities they serve. The show, which can be understood by both Urdu and Hindi speaking audiences, understands the vast cultural differences of these audiences. As such, generic words with no particular cultural weight are used as well as subtitles in either language when necessary. CJNT-DT is a multicultural broadcast television station in Montreal owned independently from Omni Television (owned by Channel Zero since 2009), whose roots are traced back to a public access ethnic cable channel that launched in the 1980s called La Télévision Ethnique du Québec (TEQ). The station broadcasts approximately 60 percent of its programming in seven languages. The station has the unusual distinction of being the only multicultural television station to be affiliated with an English-language television system as it served as an affiliate of CH (later E!) from 2001 to 2009 under the ownership of Canwest; as a CH/E! affiliate, the station aired select programming from the system in varied languages such as Spanish, Portuguese and Italian, in order to partially fulfill its language requirements.CJNT: Multicultural American celebrity news In May 2012, Rogers Media announced the purchase of CJNT from Channel Zero, with the intent to affiliate the station with its primary television system Citytv rather than affiliate the station with Omni Television (though some of Omni's ethnic programming will likely be supplied to fulfill ethnic programming requirements).Citytv expanding into Quebec & Western Canada , CityNews, May 3, 2012. Another Canadian ethnic television service is specialty cable channel Telelatino. Serving Italian and Spanish Canadian audiences, the station is available in 3.5 million Canadian homes on the second tier. Telelatino is also committed to reaching out to a bigger audience outside of first generation immigrants. It has tried to grab a larger audience by introducing third- language programming in English as well as dubbing a second audio in English over its third-language programming. As it is majority owned by Corus Entertainment, TLN also shows children shows from YTV and Treehouse TV dubbed in Spanish. The audiences of ethnic stations are large enough to matter to advertisers, and this was made most obvious in the case of Italian-Australian comic Joe Avati's local Canadian tour. With TLN's promotion of the tour, Avati sold out 1800 seats for $50 each in 15 minutes. With this success due in part to TLN’s promotion, Avati expanded his tour by seven more shows in southern Ontario and Montréal. TLN subsidizes their 60 percent third language shows by showing 40 percent English programming. Many ethnic broadcasters use this 60/40 model. Golive TV is a Multicultural TV in Canada. You can watch through the iOS app or Android App. The Golive TV was created in 2016 to unite, inform, and strengthen social communities, families and businesses. A new way to communicate through the latest technologies, and entertain with the best content online and live. http://www.golivetv.ca Issues Newspaper The need for ethnic newspapers is high as the representation of ethnic minorities is low in mainstream Canadian newspapers. The newsgathering staffs of 37 newspapers from across the 10 Canadian provinces only have 3.4 per cent non- white individuals. In fact, 22 out the 37 newspapers have an all white staff. With no diversity in ethnicities the stories being presented through the mainstream papers do not present issues of interest to minorities or present an accurate picture of minority culture to the mainstream audience. This is in part due to the lack of structure in funneling minorities into the reporting and editing sphere, a structure that is present in the United States. As such the black community in Montreal, for example, receive limited coverage in mainstream papers. This coverage is usually around “black” events such as Black History Month in February or during summer for Nuit D’afrique and Carifestival. This “calendar journalism” presents a very limited view of these communities and only further removes them from being included in to mainstream discourse as this coverage further perpetuates otherness. If the black community does get coverage in the mainstream English papers of Montreal, it is to highlight a black athletes success at a sporting event, or to highlight a violent crime. This only further perpetuates stereotypes of the black community both good and bad. The reductionist coverage of black individuals in the cities mainstream print publications is undoubtedly related to the lack of diversity in the newsrooms. Ultimately the Multicultural Policy, which was created to avoid this under and misrepresentation, does not address the racism that causes these structural inequalities in the media. Thus the Montreal Community Contact has not changed the mainstream coverage of the black community in their city. Once one looks at the numbers, this is not hard to understand. Despite the 159,000 black people in Montreal in 2001, the Contact only had a circulation of less than 8,000 papers. Only 7% of the community read the paper that year. Furthermore, there is limited mainstream access to the paper. The Montreal Community Contact is distributed by being left at ethnic stores or black community centres. This is a common distribution strategy for many ethnic newspapers in Canada. This is problematic as by making the paper only available to the ethnic audiences, little impact is made in changing the image of minorities to the mainstream population. Furthermore, the papers cannot impact the community’s image of itself as it is not accessible to all members of the community. Television One of the problems ethic television station face is the lack of both qualitative and quantitative research information about their audiences. Audience measurement numbers such as the A.C. Nielson and BBM do not have the metrics to provide accurate tacking of ethnic audiences. This problem led to OMNI’s purchase of the Manifold Data Mining to provide the numbers to verify the Chinese and South Asian markets purchasing power to advertisers. However, other channels that wish to corroborate their ethnic audience numbers do not have such tools thus severely effecting they’re funding from advertisers. Another issue, which affects the ethnic broadcasters, is the way their audiences have come to see their news coverage. In Minelle Mahtani’s article “Racializing the Audience: Immigrant Perceptions of Mainstream Canadian English-Language TV News”, Mahtani found that ethnic audiences are unconvinced of the TV news channels geared towards minorities. In a focus group of Iranian immigrants conducted in Vancouver one participant stated “If I’m really looking for information I will turn to CBC…if I want serious information I wouldn’t watch Channel M.” Other participants of the focus groups deemed ethnic channels as “fluffy” or not providing information relevant to them. What is more is, these participants felt that ethnic media did not represent their lives in a less reductionist manner than mainstream media. Thus the audiences of ethnic media still do not feel their cultures’ complexities are represented accurately or at all. The ethnic broadcasts that focused on cultural events did not serve their needs and the ethnic audiences wanted more “inclusive and representative storytelling”. The ethnic television stations lack of legitimacy in mainstream realm further affects the minorities’ view of them. By tackling this issue of legitimacy, the ethnic broadcasters will not only help their image to mainstream audiences but also to their target audiences. Satellite Television =Grey Market Satellite Systems= Recently, Canada has seen the advance of the “Grey market satellite system”. These are subscription based TV services not owned by Canadian companies but have subscribers in Canada. In September 2002 the President of the Canadian Cable Televisions Association estimated as many as 700,000 illegal satellites were in Canada. Most of these dishes are not purchased from Canadian companies. This revenue could have gone to licensed Canadian companies such as Bell ExpressVu or Rogers Digital Cable. Immigrants who want and need programs and stations from their native home countries purchase many of these dishes. The figures point to a need for an expansion of third-language media as well as a lack of satisfaction of existing third-language media in Canada. Despite the need to grow third-language media further, in 2003 the government rejected adding more foreign-language broadcasters. In the same year, the CRTC stated in a report “Canadians enjoy access to a wide variety of ethnic services”. This statement was extremely problematic as at that time, though there were 93 foreign-owned channels licensed for broadcasting in Canada but only 10 were in languages other than English or French. Also, though most third-language broadcasters are approved by the CRTC they do not have carriers, making them inaccessible to Canadians. Furthermore, in the 14 largest TV markets, only 4 analogue specialty services were available which only catered to Italian, Spanish, Cantonese, South Asian and Greek communities. With the limited numbers of ethnic programming provided by the legal means, the immigrant and ethnic communities’ reliance on “illegal” satellite services only grows. In February 2004 there was an attempt to amend the Radiocommunication Act to increase the penalty for transmitting or decoding unauthorized satellite signal. As the CRTC refused to add more third-language channels to the existing cable and satellite services, many saw this amendment as a direct attack on the minorities whose needs were not being met by the framework set in place. The amendment did not go through as it was seen as an attack on cultural diversity. By mid-2004, the CRTC allowed access to more third-language channels but only to subscribers who already paid for ethnic channels based in Canada. =Al Jazeera= Al Jazeera English was approved for broadcasting in Canada by the CRTC in 2004. There was support for the station by the Muslim and Arabic communities in Canada. However, the Canadian Jewish Congress was less than enthusiastic about the networks availability in Canada. They stated “Under the guise of a seemingly legitimate news agency, Al Jazeera has provided hatemongers and terrorists with a platform for their view.” Ultimately, many in the Jewish communities found the station allowed and promoted anti-Semitic sentiments. The CRTC eventually concluded that though Al Jazeera had not promoted any such hateful views yet, it could potentially. This finding is extremely problematic as it gives any community or lobbyist the power to influence what channels are and are not approved by the CRTC. Any station can potentially promote hateful or spiteful messages. To allow any segment of the population to influence the CRTC’s decision on an ethnic channel can keep any third-language station off of Canadian airwaves legally. In the case of Al Jazeera, the CRTC made it the responsibility of the cable and satellite distributors to alter or delete any “abusive comments” made on Al Jazeera programming. The censorship power is otherwise forbidden to distributors. The authorization of this censorship can be seen as an act of racism on behalf of the CRTC as they only granted this censorship authority for this Arabic station. This marked the Arabic message as a deviant and ultimately uncanadian message, further perpetuating a growing Muslimphobia in the post 9/11 landscape. Furthermore, by passing the responsibility of censorship to distributors, the CRTC ensured the network would not receive carriage by the Canadian cable and satellite distributors. As Shaw Communications President Peter Bissonette explained by taking the responsibility which came with Al Jazeera, meant having a human monitoring the channel for 24 hours, who was fluent in Arabic, and knew contemporary broadcasting standards. Due to this demand in human and technological services, Al Jazeera is still not viewed on television in Canadian homes legally.

It is a pita stuffed with minced meat and spiced with onions, pepper, parsley, and occasionally chilies. The major variants of hawawshi are \\"baladi\\" (standard) and Alexandrian. In most of Egypt, it is baked by filling the flat Egyptian bread with the meat mix and then baking it in the oven. In Alexandria, the ingredients are placed between two circular layers of dough, then baked in an oven. Alexandrian hawawshi also usually have different spices and seasonings. Hawawshi has spread to other countries in the Middle East and North Africa with some variation. In the Levant, it is made using saj bread and includes hot peppers in the filling. In Algeria, it is known as \\"muhajib\\" and is eaten with soup or a yoghurt salad. Hawawshi is commonly made in Egyptian homes and is also served in some restaurants, usually as a take-away. Prices at restaurants range from 10-30 guineas, depending on the size and amount of meat used. History Hawawshi was invented in 1971 by an Egyptian butcher named Ahmed al-Hawawsh. From his stall in the Souk Al-Tawfik neighborhood in Cairo, hawawshi spread throughout Cairo and then to the rest of Egypt.

The majority of the portraits were first painted in oil by Charles Bird King. McKenney was working as the US Superintendent of Indian Trade and would head the Office of Indian Affairs, both then within the War Department. He planned publication of the biographical project to be supported by private subscription, as was typical for publishing of the time. Believing that Native Americans were threatened as a race, McKenney wanted to preserve a record of their leaders for government archives, as well as to share it with the American people. He commissioned Charles Bird King to paint portraits of leaders who came to Washington to negotiate treaties, and James Hall to write biographies of them. The publication project incorporated lithographs made from the paintings. Background From about 1821,Dates according to the list of paintings given by the Library of Congress Thomas McKenney, the U.S. Superintendent of Indian Trade within the War Department, started to commission portraits from Charles Bird King of American Indians who had traveled to Washington, D.C. as delegates to negotiate treaties with the federal government. McKenney continued this project as head of the Office of Indian Affairs. King painted portraits of American Indians up to 1837. Additional painters who were commissioned to paint portraits included James Otto Lewis, Peter Rindisbacher, and Henry Inman. McKenney said he wanted to preserve \\"in the archives of the Government whatever of the aboriginal man can be rescued from the destruction which awaits his race.\\" He believed that American Indians were threatened as a people by the expansion of European- American society. Aware that there was ill feeling against them by those who wanted their land, he said the American Indians should be \\"looked upon as human beings, having bodies and souls like ours.\\" The growing collection of portraits was first housed in the United States Department of War, which then had responsibility for Indian Affairs. In 1858, the original oil paintings were moved to The Castle, the Smithsonian Institution's first building. It was also used as a repository and gallery for artworks. Publication To reach a wider public, McKenney commissioned lithographs of the paintings, with each portrait to be supported by a full biography of the subject. The full project was envisioned to be published in three volumes. To research and write those, McKenney commissioned James Hall (1793–1868), a judge and Treasurer of the State of Illinois, who was known as a writer.Jennifer Anderson, Thomas L. McKenney & James Hall , Art & Architecture of New Jersey website. Hall had difficulty in developing his material, as McKenney never provided promised source material. Hall spent eight years tracking and researching the subjects, about whom McKenney had provided little more than names. The subscription price of $120 for the whole set had seemed high at the beginning of the project, but it was not enough to defray the costs incurred during the exacting production process of the original folio volumes. The Panic of 1837 nearly dealt the project a deathblow, depriving many of its subscribers of the means to pay for their subscriptions. At that time, McKenney withdrew completely from the project. Hall and a new publisher (C. Rice & A N Hart) brought the series to completion, with the final installment appearing in January 1844. This was long after McKenney had thought he could first publish the portrait/biography project. In the end, there were a total of 1,250 subscribers. 1865 fire at the Smithsonian In the winter of 1865, workers relocating the portraits brought in a wood-burning stove to provide warmth, and vented the stovepipe into a ventilation shaft which they mistook for a flue. After two weeks, a full fire had ignited in the ventilation shaft. The second floor was engulfed, and the roof of the Castle subsequently collapsed. It was the most catastrophic fire in the Smithsonian's history: 295 of the original Indian portraits were consumed; only five were rescued. Although one of the painters had made a few copies of his favorite portraits for himself, nearly all of the portraits would have been irretrievably lost had McKenney, Hall, and their colleagues not completed the lithography and publication project. The volumes remain a record of prominent Native American leaders of the first half of the 19th century.

It can attach itself to the sea floor using two long filaments and has two retractable tentacles at the opposite end. Its appearance has been said to resemble a two-tailed box kite. Discovery The Benthic comb jelly was discovered off the coast of Japan at the Ryukyu Trench. It was observed by the remotely operated underwater vehicle Kaikō on a dive into the Ryukyu Trench in April 2002, but the video and images of this unique bottom dwelling ctenophore remained \\"undiscovered\\" until several years later. During April 2006, scientists from the Census of Marine Zooplankton observed a number of rare deep-sea ctenophores, which led to a re-examination of the cydippid ctenophore taxonomy and the suggestion that there be two new families of cydippid ctenophore. Due to several taxonomic affinities, researchers considered this species for inclusion in the genus Aulacoctena. However, it also displayed differences from that genus, so it may need to be placed in a new genus. The specimens were not brought to the surface and in any event, appear fragile and might not withstand the changes of pressure involved. Diet Many questions have arisen about the availability of food for the benthic comb jelly. Previously, it was thought the abyssal depths of deep sea trenches, such as this one, could not support predators that actively hunt macroscopic food sources (as opposed to sessile predators, which do not hunt). This led some to believe that there is missing information about the area's ecosystem.

Lining this are narrow ribs known as septa, each having a tall tentacular lobe near its origin in the centre. The septa bear unlobed teeth and further tentacular lobes at intervals where the septa divide. Outside the corallite the ribs continue, now known as costae, bearing rows of tiny spines. The underside of the coral bears a scar resulting from its detachment from the sea bed as a juvenile. The colour varies, often being brown, yellowish or blue with contrasting tentacular lobes. The polyp has a central, slit-like mouth and a small number of short, tapering tentacles.Fungia (mushroom coral) Reef coral genera of the Western Indian Ocean. Retrieved 2011-12-14.Plate Coral- Fungia scutaria LHS Virtual Zoo. Retrieved 2011-12-14. Distribution and habitat Lobactis scutaria occurs in the Indian Ocean on upper reef slopes especially where there is considerable movement of the water as a result of wave action. It is usually found on sand or beds of coral fragments. It is often associated with other species of Fungia. Biology Lobactis scutaria mouth Lobactis scutaria is a carnivore and catches plankton, shrimps and fish with its tentacles. Lobactis scutaria is a hermaphrodite. Eggs and sperm are ejected through the mouth and after fertilisation, develop into planula larvae which form part of the plankton. After some time these settle on the seabed and undergo metamorphosis. The juveniles attach themselves to the substrate and start feeding, extruding their hard skeletons and growing. At a later stage they become detached from their base and drift around on the sea bed. The polyps feed by day as well as by night.

The history of Cherry Street is tied to the blues heritage of the area beginning in the 1940s. History Around the time of incorporation of West Helena in 1917, the lumber industry was the primary economic force in the region, with five companies producing barrel staves being the primary employers. Prohibition put these companies out of business, followed by two devastating floods in the following decades left Helena and West Helena in bad shape for the approaching Depression. King Biscuit Time, a blues radio show, was produced for the first time in November 1941 by KFFA.

The National Portrait Gallery in London holds two of his stipple engravings, along with a lithograph (printed by Nosworthy & Wells). Biography Penstone was born in Clerkenwell, London, to John Penstone (1792–1840) and Ann, a daughter of Joseph Jewell. Both of his parents were Quakers, but he joined the Plymouth Brethren when he was about 19 years old. He was involved in some of the religious controversies which caused splits in the Brethren movement during his lifetime, and by the death of his second wife he was disappointed with the way some members had behaved. In 1850 Penstone moved from Chelsea in London to Stanford in the Vale where his father and both grandfathers had been born. He was described as a \\"Bible scholar and Christian poet\\" in Chief Men among the Brethren but seems to have had an interest in secular subjects as well because in the late 1850s he was an active contributor to Notes and Queries on literary, artistic and historical subjects. cites J.J.

Although he enjoyed working in this area he was never more than an interested amateur, as he earned his living as an artist. Works Penstone exhibited works at the Royal Academy as early as 1838 and as late as 1895. His works exhibited at the Academy (as an honorary exhibitor) were: *1838. (1048) The Saxon Bride. *1846.

In 1872 he returned to architecture. With Historian Alexander Carl Guth calls Douglas \\"a very emotional man, likewise...very pompous and always on his dignity, both in manner and dress,\\" and relates an anecdote in which \\"a stranger came to [Douglas'] office looking for a prominent architect by the name of [Henry C.] Koch. Douglas straightaway disclaimed all knowledge of such a man and informed the stranger that he was now standing in the presence of the most eminent architect of the day and that he had better take due heed of same. It is needless to say that this stranger was none other than a prospective client for Koch, but Douglas made such an impression on the man that he rightway [sic] engaged him as his architect.\\" A number of his works are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

In 1843, with fellow early settler John Israel Montefiore, he secured a grant of land on the corner of Karangahape Road and Symonds Street for a Jewish section of the Symonds Street Cemetery, Auckland. As his business prospered, he traded in kauri gum and tea and operated a bond store. He was a founder member of the Auckland Chamber of Commerce, established in 1856, and president in 1868. He was a trustee of the Auckland Savings Bank from 1864 to 1885 and vice president from 1878 to 1882, was an early commissioner for the port of Auckland, and served on the city council in 1854–55.

He married Mary Vickers on 4 December of the same year, after a protracted engagement of seven years; the church had required that they not marry until Neale had been ordained. The conference of the following year approved his chaplaincy with the armed forces. Neale arrived in France in 1917 with the 22nd Reinforcements, saw action at Ypres and Passchendaele (where he was seriously wounded), and worked with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission at Gallipoli.  Middle years  On his return to New Zealand he worked in Dunedin and Christchurch ministering to the poor. He was Superintendent of the Dunedin Central Mission for 20 years, a founder of the Radio Church of the Helping Hand, and founded the Eventide Home in Dunedin. With the onset of the great depression, he was instrumental in setting up the first work relief stations in the Christchurch suburb of Papanui.

Most nip joints are located in residential areas inside homes. The individual in charge is therefore referred to as the \\"House Man\\" or \\"House Lady\\". Some nip joints have more amenities than others.  Government tax revenue  By not paying the taxes levied on ethanol sold for consumption (and also typically not paying the taxes on their own income from the practice), moonshiners, bootleggers, and nip joint operators are able to make a significant tax-free profit. The enforcement of laws against bootlegging and moonshining is therefore necessary to protect a significant source of government revenue, as well as to provide a fair competitive environment for businesses that comply with the law. In 2007, the U.S. federal government took in over $5.6 billion in taxes on alcoholic beverages. This government revenue source is protected by the law enforcement activities against those who do not pay the taxes. As the government of the Commonwealth of Virginia put it, \\"a nip joint operation deprives the licensed restaurant owner of a legitimate source of income, and deprives the citizens of the Commonwealth and its localities of a legitimate source of tax revenues.\\" Public health  Improperly produced moonshine can contain impurities (methanol) or adulterants that can be hazardous to public health. Illness and deaths caused by moonshine in the United States are exceedingly rare, though underreporting is likely to be present in the statistics. In December 2011 it was reported that 168 people had died in India after consuming moonshine that had been improperly made and therefore contained high levels of methanol. The incidence of impure moonshine has been documented to significantly increase the risk of renal disease among those who regularly consume it, primarily from increased lead content.

He is currently a Leverhulme Early Career Fellow at Bournemouth University. Career McCartney is an award-winning nautical archaeologist who specialises in the discovery of and investigation into twentieth-century shipwrecks including the wrecks of the Battle of Jutland and the U-boat wars. He specialises in examining how understandings of the past are revised by the interaction of shipwreck archaeology with the historical record. He sits on the editorial board of the Society for Nautical Research and is a past reviews editor of The Mariner's Mirror. In 1989 he became involved in shipwreck archaeology when he learned to dive. One of Britain's first Trimix-certified scuba divers, in 1998 became the first person to have dived on the three great liner wrecks, SS Andrea Doria, RMS Lusitania and HMHS Britannic. In 1998, he earned the distinction of being one of a handful of civilian divers allowed to explore the wreck of the Amphion-class submarine HMS Affray, which was lost on 16 April 1951 on the northern edge of Hurds Deep, due to an accident sustained during a training exercise. In 1999 he discovered the 12-inch-gunned submarine HMS M1 off Start Point in the English Channel. In 2001 he discovered the wreck of HMS Indefatigable sunk at the Battle of Jutland and in 2003 co-produced the Channel 4 documentary \\"Clash of the Dreadnoughts\\" which included surveys of HMS Defence and HMS Invincible. In 2001-2 McCartney led expeditions to identify some of the U-boats sunk during Operation Deadlight. Fourteen U-boats were surveyed and several new sites discovered including the rare Type XXI U-boat, U2506 once under the command of Horst von Schroeter and the successful Type IXC U-boat, U155 commanded by Adolf Piening. In 2003, McCartney was featured in the Channel 4 series Wreck Detectives. In the film he identified the mystery World War I U-boat off Trevose Head, Cornwall as by scraping the propellers to reveal the shipyard stamp. This proved that even at 60 metres' depth, war graves of this type can be identified by divers without the need to scavenge parts from them. In 2006 McCartney was the lead contributor in the award-winning Deep Wreck Mysteries episode, \\"U-boat Death-Trap\\" which depicted his search for the identity of three mystery U-boats off the north coast of Cornwall. In the same year he discovered the German auxiliary raider HSK Komet in the English Channel . At the time, it was the only known example of this type of warship anywhere in the world. In 2008 he found the White Star Line transport SS ArmenianHistory Channel: Deep Wreck Mysteries episode guide off the Scilly Isles as part of the Deep Wreck Mysteries television series. He also featured in the episodes \\"Death of a Battleship\\" which investigated the loss of HMS Audacious in 1914 and in \\"Stealth Sub\\" which investigated the loss of U480, a sub he had previously identified in 1998. In 2011 he identified the very early U-boat, UA off Folkestone. German-built in 1912 and destined for the Norwegian navy, it was taken over by the Imperial German Navy in 1914. It was long thought to have been scrapped in France after 1918. In 2012 McCartney worked alongside wreck hunter David Mearns on an archaeological investigation of the wreck of HMS Hood, sunk in 1941. This project was supported by philanthropist Paul Allen aboard his yacht Octopus. The expedition findings were featured in the Channel Four documentary \\"How the Bismarck sank HMS Hood\\". In 2013 McCartney featured as the lead contributor on a Time Team Special entitled \\"The Lost Submarine of WW1\\". This film examines the pioneering submarines of the First World War. He also identified the remains of the World War I U-boats SM UC-72 and SM UB-114 in the waters of the English Channel . In 2014 McCartney completed his PhD at Bournemouth University entitled \\"The Maritime Archaeology of a Modern Conflict: Comparing the archaeology of German submarine wrecks to the historical text\\". It was published by Routledge in December of the same year. It shows the extent to which historical sources relating U-boat losses in UK waters in both world wars differ from the actual distribution of the known and identified wrecks. Over 40% of those investigated had no historical precedent. The accuracy of the historic text fell as low as 36% during 1945. In November he was awarded the Reg Vallintine Achievement Award for Historical Diving. In 2015 and 2016 McCartney worked as archaeological advisor to JD-Contractor (Denmark's leading underwater contractor) and the Sea War Museum Jutland on detailed archaeological shipwreck surveys utilising swath bathymetry (multibeam) off the west coast of Denmark which included all of the heretofore undiscovered wrecks of the Battle of Jutland. This was published in \\"Jutland 1916: The Archaeology of a Naval Battlefield\\" and was the basis of the Channel 4 documentary \\"Jutland: WWI's Greatest Sea Battle\\", both released in May 2016. Other newly discovered sites included the British submarine HMS Tarpon. The wreck was the subject of a live broadcast by Denmark's public television channel DR3 on 28 August 2016 in which McCartney contributed. 2016 also saw McCartney assist Scottish Power in identifying a World War I UB-III Class U-boat off the Wigtownshire coast which was found during the seabed survey for an undersea power cable between England and Scotland. McCartney has suggested the wreck is or possibly which were both sunk after attacks by British patrol boats in April 1918. In January 2017 working again with JD-Contractor and the Sea War Museum Jutland, McCartney partook in the most comprehensive survey ever undertaken of the seabed of the Scapa Flow naval anchorages. Aboard the survey ship Vina, the multibeam survey covered 40 square kilometres. The results were published in May 2019 in \\"SCAPA 1919: The Archaeology of a Scuttled Fleet\\" . In December 2017 he was awarded the 2016 Anderson Medal by the Society for Nautical Research. In 2018 McCartney embarked on a three-year Leverhulme funded Early Career Fellowship entitled \\"Echoes from the Deep\\" which is researching how remote sensing can be applied to inventorise large numbers of shipwrecks at the regional level . He also contributed to two episodes of Drain the Oceans television series, \\"Drain the Oceans: S01 E01 Nazi Secrets\\", and \\"Drain the Oceans: SO2 E03 Killer U-Boats\\",. In May 2020 it was announced that the wreck of the landing craft LCT 326 had been found off Bardsey Island during surveys by Bangor University, in collaboration with McCartney. The wreck is located over 100 nautical miles from its supposed loss position . This was one example of the myriad discoveries made during \\"Echoes from the Deep\\". McCartney stated that: “The wreck of LCT 326 is one of over 300 sites in Welsh waters which have been surveyed and the aim of this particular piece of research is to identify as many offshore wrecks in Welsh waters as possible and shed light on their respective maritime heritage. This aspect of the project has resulted in many new and exciting discoveries relating to both world wars, of which LCT 326 is just one example” .

Early life Tahlonteeskee was a Cherokee headman of Cayoka town, on Hiawassee Island (in modern-day Hamilton County, Tennessee). Following the decision he and Chief Doublehead made to sign over large parcels of traditional Cherokee hunting grounds to the United States in 1805, they found themselves considered by many Cherokee to be traitors.Gore, Oklahoma: Tahlonteeskee - Oldest Capital in Oklahoma; webpage; Leisure and Sports Review; accessed November 2015 After Doublehead was assassinated in 1807 for his part in the land transfer, Tahlonteeskee emigrated into the west in 1809, one of the first of the \\"Old Settlers\\" of the new Cherokee Nation then being established in the Arkansaw Territory. He was the son of Tahlonteeskee \\"Aaron Price\\" Bloody Fellow and Wurteh Betsy Watts, who was the mother of Chief John Jolly Due, Chief Robert \\"the Bench\\" Benge, and Sequoyah George Gist. Tahlonteeskee became the third Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation -West in 1817 (succeeding Takatoka), and served until his death in 1819, when he in turn was succeeded by his brother, John Jolly. He was the first western chief to allow Christianity to be taught to the Cherokee, and permitted missionaries to establish Dwight Mission in the Nation's holdings in the Arkansaw, before the Federal Government forced the Old Settlers even further west, into the area of the future Indian Territory. Extended family According to the Cherokee genealogist, Dr. Emmet Starr, the alternative spelling of his name, \\"Talotisky,\\" was possibly an alliterative spelling of Tahlonteeskee (since at that time there was not yet a uniform system of writing Cherokee sounds into English). He was the older brother (or possibly a half-brother) of John Jolly. Tahlonteeskee married Jennie Lowrey, sister of Assistant Principal Chief George Lowrey. Lowery may have been a cousin of Sequoyah. Lowery's wife was Lucy Benge, a half-sister of Sequoyah. Lucy was the sister of Chickamauga warrior, Bob Benge (often referred to as 'Captain' Bench), whose uncle was John Watts (or 'Young Tassel').NOTE: The Cherokee embraced the matrilineal clan system, in which uncle-nephew connections were more important than father-son relationships. Namesake Tahlonteeskee, Oklahoma, the first capital city of the early western Cherokee Nation, was named for him. The town acted in that capacity from 1828 through 1839, when the new capitol building was completed in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, and the seat of government moved there. It is the oldest governmental capital in Oklahoma.Tahlonteeskee; photo of roadside marker [Oklahoma Historical Society]; at waymarking.com; accessed November 2015. Notes References *Wilkins, Thurman.

Memorial history Prior to the October 1983 attack, the City of Jacksonville Beautification and Appearance Commission had established a program to plant trees in the city as a \\"living memorial\\" to its citizens. Immediately after the Beirut barracks bombing, the Commission met to consider ways to memorialize the peacekeepers who died in the attack, ultimately requesting permission to plant additional trees on Lejeune Boulevard, the street linking the city to the Marine Corps Base. News spread about this plan, attracting donations on a national level, a response considered by the Commission as the \\"birth of the Beirut Memorial.\\" Later, as contributions continued to be made, Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune \\"offered the Commission 4.5 acres of highly visible and publicly accessible land at the corner of Lejeune Boulevard and Montford Landing Road,\\" enabling the Commission to begin work on a memorial, in addition to the trees. Memorial design Statue at Beirut Memorial Once Camp Lejeune had offered land for the erection of a memorial, the Commission launched a competition to create a design, inviting graduate students at the North Carolina State University's School of Design to offer ideas. Two students' designs were selected based on the positive attributes of their schemes and they subsequently collaborated on the final design and construction details. The proposed statue on the pedestal was originally conceived to be a seated soldier bowing his head in sadness, between the \\"rubble\\" of broken walls. At that time, no Marine memorial statuary had depicted a seated soldier figure. The Memorial was officially dedicated on October 23, 1986. The statue was added after the dedication, with a design expression in keeping with the Marine Corps' standards. The design included a representation of two broken walls—reminiscent of the \\"crumbled walls\\" of the building demolished by the truck bomb attack—with a pedestal between them to support a statue. The bronze statue included in the memorial was later created by Abbé Godwin, the same artist who had created North Carolina's Vietnam Memorial in Raleigh, North Carolina, and was dedicated on October 22, 1988. A full-size replica was created for the National Fleet Reserve Associated Headquarters, in Alexandria, Virginia, and miniature replicas were created for the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation, to help fund scholarships for military dependents. Beirut families later requested that the poem \\"The Other Wall,\\" written by Robert A. Gannon, be added to the memorial, and a special dedication ceremony was held in 1991 to recognize the poem's addition, with its words cast in bronze as a permanent part of the Memorial. The Memorial bears the inscription \\"THEY CAME IN PEACE,\\" along with 273 names: the names of those who died in the attack, the names of those who later died as a result of the injuries they sustained in the explosion, as well as the names of three Marine Corps pilots from the Jacksonville, North Carolina, area who were killed in the 1983 rescue operation in the island of Grenada. The words, \\"They came in peace,\\" were chosen because they were used by the survivors of the attack on a makeshift memorial erected after the rescue efforts in Beirut: a memorial that consisted of a stretcher, a wreath, and a sign with the words, \\"24 MAU: They Came in Peace.\\"Photo and description of memorial created by survivors of the attack in Beirut, retrieved December 15, 2011.

The Pittsburgh Line is Norfolk Southern Railway's primary east-west artery in its Pittsburgh Division and Harrisburg Division across Pennsylvania and it is part of the Amtrak-Norfolk Southern combined rail corridor, the Keystone Corridor. The Pittsburgh Line is a former Pennsylvania Railroad property, beginning as two rail lines, the Middle Division Main Line and the Pittsburgh Division Main Line which were combined to the form the modern day Pittsburgh Line, and then eventually the combined Middle Division/Pittsburgh Division Main Line was combined with the PRR's Philadelphia main line to form the new Main Line of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The new PRR main line continued through the Penn Central years and was broken up by Conrail, the combined Middle Division/Pittsburgh Main Line and the Philadelphia main line were both reestablished and both respectfully received new names, the Pittsburgh Line and the Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line. The Pittsburgh Line was passed from Conrail to Norfolk Southern Railway and the Philadelphia to Harrisburg Line was passed to Amtrak. Together, the Pittsburgh Line and the Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line both make up the current day Keystone Corridor which all of it was previously referred to as the Main Line of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The Pittsburgh Line spans between the state capitol in Harrisburg and its namesake city of Pittsburgh, crossing the Allegheny Mountains through the Gallitzin Tunnels west of Altoona and the famous Horseshoe Curve in the process. Its east end is marked with the railroad's Harrisburg Line to Reading and Philadelphia, and the Fort Wayne Line on its west end to Conway, Pennsylvania and points west in Ohio and Indiana.Norfolk Southern (2008). \\"Pittsburgh Division.\\"; \\"Harrisburg Division.\\" Track charts. The Pittsburgh Line is arguably Norfolk Southern's busiest freight corridor, where 50 to 70 trains traverse the line daily. History The Pittsburgh Line is formerly owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and it began as two rail lines, the Middle Division Main Line which was part of the PRR Middle Division and the Pittsburgh Division Main Line which was part of the PRR Pittsburgh Division. The Pennsylvania Railroad combined the Middle Division Main Line and the Pittsburgh Division Main Line into one rail line, forming the Pittsburgh Line, though at the time, the Pittsburgh Line was not refer to by that name. At the same time the Middle Division and the Pittsburgh Division was also combined together. The Pennsylvania Railroad eventually combined the merged Middle Division/Pittsburgh Division Main Line with their main rail line to Philadelphia, forming the Main Line of the Pennsylvania Railroad (now known as the Keystone Corridor). This Main Line of the Pennsylvania Railroad served as the PRR's primarily line Pennsylvania, the line continued its existence through the Penn Central years and through the early years of Conrail. The PRR Main Line was passed down to Conrail and Conrail broke the PRR Main Line into two rail lines again, reestablishing the Pittsburgh Line and the PRR Philadelphia main line which eventually became known as the Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line which is now under ownership of Amtrak. The Pittsburgh Line received its current name in the 1980s under Conrail. The Pittsburgh Line was passed down to the Norfolk Southern Railway in 1999 during the breakup of Conrail between CSX Transportation. Today, the Pittsburgh Line is a valuable asset to Norfolk Southern. Some most famous parts of the Pittsburgh Line is the Horseshoe Curve and the Gallitzin Tunnels. Major terminals The Pittsburgh Line is marked with three major freight terminals on both of its ends. On its east end, Harrisburg Terminal handles a bulk of the railroads intermodal traffic, with a handful intermodal trains originating and terminating there. Across the Susquehanna River in Enola is Norfolk Southern's major freight terminal in the Greater Harrisburg area; Enola Yard, which handles almost all manifest freight traffic that passes through the area. Many of the Pittsburgh Line's manifest freight trains originate or terminate here, with a few continuing south to Baltimore, Maryland and points east, while others bypass Enola and cross the Rockville Bridge over the Susquehanna to Harrisburg bound for Allentown, Pennsylvania and points east. On its west end, the Pittsburgh Line becomes the Fort Wayne Line after crossing the Allegheny River bridge, where trains travel a short distance of to reach Conway Yard. Conway is the hub of activity in Western Pennsylvania, where many trains originate and terminate, with many of those trains being the same freight trains that originate and terminate at Enola Yard, respectively. Conway is the hub of operations for Norfolk Southern in the Greater Pittsburgh area, featuring a hump yard and a crew change point for virtually all Pittsburgh and Fort Wayne Line trains. Routing Port Royal and Millerstown From Harrisburg/Enola, the railroad travels west following the path of the Susquehanna River parallel to U.S. Route 11/15, passing through the communities of Marysvile, Cove, and Duncannon. At Duncannon, the Pittsburgh Line leaves the Susquehanna and follows the path of the smaller Juniata River, of which it will follow for much of its length to Altoona, unofficially dubbed the \\"Middle Division\\", after the Pittsburgh Line's predecessor, the Middle Division Main Line which was part of the Pennsylvania RailRoad (PRR) Middle Division. U.S. Route 22 follows the route for much of its length here. Once at Altoona, the railroad arrives at the base of the Allegheny Mountain Front, of which it must climb over to reach Johnstown and Pittsburgh. Altoona is the site of Norfolk Southern (NS)'s Juniata Shops, the largest locomotive repair facility on the NS system. Originally constructed by the PRR in 1850, this large complex of shops is what gave the city of Altoona its worth and structure. Leaving Altoona, the railroad travels at a 1.76% grade up the east slope of the Alleghenies, negotiating the famous Horseshoe Curve during that climb. Past the curve, the Pittsburgh Line continues to climb a grade of 1.86% to the small town of Gallitzin, where the mainline reaches the top of its climb at above sea level, the total westward climb amounting to . From there, the railroads descends the Alleghenies' west slope down to Johnstown, a total distance of about . From Johnstown, the Pittsburgh Line follows the path of the Conemaugh River on both of its banks to Conpit Junction, where the line divides. Westbound and lighter eastbound trains take the again-graded Pittsburgh Line west towards Pittsburgh, while heavier eastbound trains take the Conemaugh Line on an easier routing from Pittsburgh, which continues to follow the Conemaugh River. The Conemaugh Line joins back in with the Pittsburgh Line at CP-PENN in Pittsburgh. The line's westernmost end is at CP- WEST PITT by Pittsburgh's Amtrak station, where it crosses the Allegheny River to form the Fort Wayne Line. Allegheny Mountains and Horseshoe Curve Three Norfolk Southern freight trains pass each other on the Horseshoe Curve in 2006. Until reaching Altoona, the Pittsburgh Line is a double-track mainline from Duncannon. Once at Altoona, a third track is added for the climb up the Allegheny Mountains. The line goes back to two at Conpit Junction, where the Conemaugh Line remains a single-track route. The east slope of Norfolk Southern's climb traverses remote mountainous terrain at a grade of about 1.8%. Roughly halfway up the westward ascent lies the Horseshoe Curve. Originally constructed by the PRR in 1854, the 220-degree curve was the solution for the railroad to gain enough elevation around a valley to reach the higher land across to continue west. Constructed mainly by immigrants, the curve was built by cutting into the hillside around Kittanning Point and filling in the necessary places for the railroad right-of-way to be laid. Today, the curve functions as a tourist attraction for both railroad enthusiasts and the rest of the public, and is a magnet for drawing visitors from all over the globe. It currently is on the list of National Historic Sites, and boasts a visitors park in the apex of the curve adjacent to the Pittsburgh Line tracks, as well as a visitors center and gift shop. Past the curve, the Pittsburgh Line continues west to Gallitzin, passing through MG Interlocking a mile west of Horseshoe Curve, whose old PRR interlocking tower is also on the historic register, though is off-limits to the public. East of Gallitzin, the railroad passes through Bennington Curve, the site of PRR passenger wreck in 1947 killing 16 people and injuring over 100. Past Bennington Curve at a railroad timetable station called \\"SF\\", the three tracks split. Tracks 2 (bi-directional) and 3 (westward) continue on towards Gallitzin at their same ascent, while Track 1 (eastward) diverges up a 2.46% grade known as \\"The Slide\\", which is a downhill-only track restricting trains to traveling no more than over its steep grade. Both sets of main tracks pass through tunnels to exit and crest in the town of Gallitzin. Tracks 2 and 3 pass through the new Allegheny Tunnel, while Track 1 passes through the New Portage Tunnel. A third tunnel can be seen; the Gallitzin Tunnel, which used to house Track 3 before the Allegheny Tunnel was heightened and widened to house Tracks 2 and 3 as well as doublestack container traffic on intermodal trains in 1994. Upon its completion in 1995, the Gallitzin Tunnel was officially closed. Past Gallitzin, the railroad passes through the small town of Cresson, where all of the Pittsburgh Line's tracks come back together. Here is also where a locomotive helper base is located, as well as interchange(s) with the RJ Corman Railroad. Also located in Cresson is the Station Inn, a bed and breakfast run exclusively for railroad enthusiasts, which features a long sheltered porch showing a close and clear view of the Pittsburgh Line tracks. Past Cresson, the railroad passes down the Alleghenies’ west slope and through the towns of Lilly, Cassandra, Portage, Wilmore, Summerhill, South Fork, Mineral Point, Parkhill, and East Conemaugh before reaching Johnstown at the bottom of the mountain. South Fork is the junction of the South Fork Secondary, a coal route used to reach local mines in the area which generates a train or two a day bound for various destinations. Helpers Helpers on the rear of an intermodal train entering the Gallitzin Tunnel Helper locomotives are used by Norfolk Southern to assist heavy trains over mountainous portions of the Pittsburgh Line. Helper crews are mainly based in Altoona and Conemaugh/Johnstown, though some helpers are called as far away as Pittsburgh. For many years, EMD SD40-2 locomotives held down pusher duties in the Altoona Helper Pool until 2009, where newer SD40E locomotives constructed by Juniata began to phase out the older locomotive models. The SD40E's finally filled the ranks of the SD40-2's in the summer of 2010. Both locomotive models are rated at , and are either used in pairs or pairings of pairs, the latter are known as \\"4-Bangers\\" on the mountain by the local railfans in the immediate and surrounding areas. In late 2019, Norfolk Southern began bringing in SD70ACUs to replace the previous SD40E fleet. In April 2020, nearly 50% of Altoona's helpers are SD70ACUs. Passenger operations The eastbound Amtrak Pennsylvanian passes through Cassandra on the Pittsburgh Line Today, a pair of Amtrak passenger trains is the only passenger service that remains on the Pittsburgh Line. Amtrak's Pennsylvanian trains make the following Pennsylvania station stops on the Pittsburgh Line: Harrisburg, Lewistown, Huntingdon, Tyrone, Altoona, Johnstown, Latrobe, Greensburg, and Pittsburgh. In May 2013 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania agreed to US$3.8 million in funding to subsidize the passenger line.State commits annual $3.8M to Pittsburgh- Harrisburg Amtrak line.

The cave was within the country of the Krowathunkooloong clan of the Gunaikurnai nation. The roof of the rock shelter outside the cave is heavily blackened, evidently from campfires. A passage leads to an inner chamber with a high cathedral-like roof. The cave was discovered by Josephine Flood, when driving to another site in eastern Victoria. Her subsequent excavations within the dry floor of the rock shelter revealed extensive evidence of stone tool making from the Australian Small Tool Tradition, with the basal layer dated to the last 1,000 years. Further inside the cave dates from the excavation showed the site was probably first occupied around 17,000 years ago, but appears to have been abandoned by 1,000 years when the outer area was occupied. Based on the relatively small quantities of discarded stone tools, the site has been interpreted as an intermittently occupied hunting site rather than a permanent campsite, with deeply stratified layers containing both stone and bone tools along with ochre and a rich faunal assemblage. The artefact assemblage is from what is described as the Australian Core Tool and Scraper Tradition.Josephine Flood, Pleistocene Man at Cloggs Cave: his Tool Kit and Environment, Mankind Volume 9, Issue 3, pages 175–188, June 1974 Cloggs Cave was the first Pleistocene occupation site to be found with intact bone.

In the Czech Republic, it is the seventy-second most common female name. \\"The legend of Divoká Šárka, or Wild Šárka, is shrouded in myth. The story of Šárka and the war between Czech men and women fifteen hundred years ago was first written down in the eleventh century, and historians are divided over whether there is any truth in it. Some say that the story is based on the ancient tales of the Amazonian warriors, while others say that it may have its roots in a pagan matriarchal society that predated the arrival of Christianity in Bohemia by thousands of years. We will probably never know the truth, but in much the same way as the tale of Robin Hood in Britain, Divoká Šárka has become part of Czech culture, and was used during the Czech National Revival to boost the role of Czech folklore in the Czech Lands... To find the roots of the legend of Divoká Šárka, we need to go back to the sixth century, or perhaps the seventh century, no-one knows for sure. It was a time when Prague didn't even exist. There were several settlements of the Slavic tribe, the Czechs, who had recently settled in the country, in what are now the suburbs of Prague. But the centre of Prague as we know it now was completely unsettled. The main settlement in the area, according to most historians, was in a narrow valley which today bears the name Divoká Šárka, to the west of today's city centre. At this time, or so legend has it, the Czechs were a matriarchal society, and were ruled by women for many generations. The last of these matriarchal rulers was Libuše. For when she died, says Václav Ledvinka, the director of Prague's city archives, the country's men made their own bid for power: \\"When Libuše died, the matriarchal system of power came to an end, and a patriarchal system was introduced, with the arrival of Prince Přemysl, the forefather of the Přemyslid dynasty, which later ruled the Czech Lands for several hundred years. The women were apparently furious at this change, and this led to a civil war between Czech women and men.\\" The war between the men and women was vicious and long. The women were led by a fierce and fabled warrior, Vlasta. But the main role in the legend belongs not to Vlasta, but to Šárka: \\"Libuše's right-hand woman in the war against the men was a young girl named Šárka. She decided that the best way to inflict the greatest loss on their opponents was to entrap their bravest and strongest fighter, a young man named Ctirad, using feminine wiles, and then kill him.\\" Šárka and Ctirad arranged a rendezvous in what is now the Divoká Šárka valley. According to the legend, Šárka then applied her feminine charms to Ctirad, with a little bit of help from some alcohol: \\"Šárka proceeded to get Ctirad drunk with mead, which was the favourite drink of most Slavs at that time, he fell in love with her, but being drunk he fell asleep. While he lay sleeping in her arms, Šárka, so the legend says, murdered him.\\" The murder of Ctirad was apparently a great blow to the male opponents of Vlasta's warriors, and for a while the loss of their greatest fighter helped the women to continue their fight, but only for a short while. In the end, the women lost the war, and a patriarchal, feudal system, under the rule of Přemysl, and later on the Přemyslid dynasty, was installed. Rather than surrender to the men, so the legend says, Šárka decided to take her own life, and jumped off a cliff in the Divoká Šárka valley. Today, one of the rock formations in the valley is called Dívčí Skok, or Girl's Jump, as this is, according to some, the site of her suicide. Whether or not Libuše, Vlasta, Šárka or Ctirad were ever real figures in Czech history, will probably never be known, as, says Václav Ledvinka, there's no proof that the war ever took place: \\"There is no historical or archaeological evidence to suggest that the war ever happened. It is a piece of mythology that was most likely created in the eleventh, or at the beginning of the twelfth century by the chronicler Cosmas, based on the ancient Greek tale of the Amazon warriors and the war against the Amazons.\\" The majority of Czech historians today believe that the legend of Divoká Šárka is entirely down to the chronicler Cosmas, who was the first to write a history of Bohemia, and that there was no matriarchal society in the Czech Lands in the sixth century. They dismiss the story as merely a rehashing of the Amazonian tale, which is not to be taken seriously. But, as with almost every period in history, says Václav Ledvinka, there are a few dissenting voices: \\"There are some historians who have, in my opinion, a somewhat fertile imagination. They claim that this women's war could actually be a throwback to a much older historical fact, that early on, in prehistoric times, there could have been a matriarchal society, that women had primacy, and that they were overthrown by men. This could be true, but then the same could be said about the ancient Greeks. So it seems most likely that Cosmas took the basis for the tale of Šárka and Ctirad from those ancient texts.\\" But the importance of the tale of Divoká Šárka may not lie in whether or not it has any historical basis, but in what it meant for the Czech people during the Czech National Revival. Under the rule of the Habsburgs, the Czech language, culture and folklore were gradually replaced by those of Austria. German was spoken in towns and cities, and Czech became relegated to villages and hamlets. It was not until towards the end of the eighteenth century that a group of Czech patriots set out to re-establish Czech as a language and to renew the idea of a Czech nation, and tales like that of Divoká Šárka played an important role in this process: \\"During the Czech National Revival, all of these old tales and legends were romanticised to emphasise Czech culture and history. They were written into books, operas were made out of them and thus they became part of our national consciousness and cultural heritage. There is even a symphonic poem written by our national composer, Bedřich Smetana, called Šárka in honour of this tale, which shows how important it was during the nineteenth century to be aware of our past.\\" Although there is no longer the same pressing need to emphasise Czech culture and heritage, Divoká Šárka still has importance today. The valley named after her is a nature reserve, and from the early spring to late autumn, the people of Prague flock there in their droves, and if you ask any Czech in the city to tell you about Divoká Šárka, they will be able to regale you with tales, of varying descriptions, of how she lured Ctirad to his death. But it's not just in Prague. The legend is an integral part of the culture today, and Czechs learn about Šárka from their early childhood: \\"The tale about Šárka, Ctirad and the women's war is part of our culture, and is part of the collection of legends that forms part of the foundations of Czech literature. It is taught in schools and everyone knows the story, even younger people, who are not as interested in it as they used to be. Many people go to the Divoká Šárka valley mainly because of the story and because of the romance it lends to the surrounding area.\\" People bearing the name include: *Šárka Barborková, Czech volleyball player *Šárka Cojocarová, Czech model *Šárka Grossová, Czech entrepreneur *Šárka Kašpárková, Czech athlete *Šárka Korbelová, Czech businesswoman *Šárka Křížková, Czech badminton player *Šárka Kubínová, Czech volleyball player *Šárka Melichárková, Czech volleyball player *Šárka Nováková, Czech high jumper *Šárka Pančochová, Czech snowboarder *Šárka Strachová, Czech alpine skier *Šárka Sudová, Czech skier *Šárka Svobodná, Czech orienteering competitor *Šárka Ullrichová, Czech actress *Šárka Vaňková, Czech singer *Šárka Varvařovská, Czech nurse *Šárka Vondrková, Czech ice dancer Mythical characters *Šárka, a mythical warrior-maiden of Bohemia, a character in The Maidens' War References Czech feminine given names ","title":"Šárka (name)"},{"id":"34065408","text":"Argentala argoptera is a moth of the family Notodontidae first described by James S.

It has a restricted distribution along the foothills of the Andes in western Ecuador. The length of the forewings is 11–12 mm for males and 11.5–13.5 mm for females. The ground color of the forewings is dark gray-brown to black, but lighter and more sparsely scaled in the basal third. The hindwings are intense white to creamy white, with a few gray scales near the base. The larvae feed on Celtis iguanaea. First instar larvae feed communally in a single cluster on the underside of the leaf. Later instars feed in loose groups, never eating the leaf midvein. Final instar caterpillars feed alone along the leaf's edge. Etymology The name is derived from the Latin word copiosus (meaning abundant) and refers to the fact that, while collecting in western Ecuador, numerous adults were observed at two locations flying in mid to late afternoon in close proximity to the branches of their host plant, Celtis iguanaea. A search of C. iguanaea foliage at these sites revealed huge numbers of eggs and larvae. It is not known whether Polypoetes copiosa is abundant every year at all times of the year, or whether these observations were instead the result of a sporadic, almost outbreak-type situation.

The company was founded in 2010 in Berlin by the German cultural theorist Martin Burckhardt. He created and developed TwinKomplex. TwinKomplex is an interactive social game which interweaves film, literary narrative, photography, design, and game to form a new genre of transmedial storytelling. German and English versions of the game are online and free2play as of November 15, 2011. According to the company a Spanish version of the game is scheduled to follow. Story and Gameplay When a new player logs in, they are given a test to determine whether they are qualified to work undercover for a mysterious secret agency. The Decentral Intelligence Agency, or DIA, is based out of Berlin and runs operations around the globe. Agents of the DIA work cooperatively with an invisible network of other agents and structures to address themes and facets affecting contemporary society. The game unfolds in a series of 12-episode-long seasons, in a release format similar to that of a television program. Over the course of an episode, which represents a week of game play, the player solves a case together with three other agents (online co-players). The cases include murders, kidnappings, political and economic crimes, ecological disasters and miscarriages of justice. The agent-players examine evidence in the form of documents, messages, videos, photographs, audio recordings and other objects, which spur the agents to follow many different leads, some of which lead to the cracking of the case. The game, characterized as \\"neo-analogue\\" by its makers, works without avatars and 3-D animation. Rather, the Non Player Characters, or NPCs, are acted by an international cast of actors. The dramaturgy of the game, therefore, unfolds in filmed live action scenes. Members of the cast include Dieter Bach as Richard Wagener, Irm Hermann as Marlene Girlinger, Anne Ratte-Polle as Anne Sievert, Bernhard Schütz as Maximilian/Benjamin van der Graaf, Christian Brückner as Anton Kaspers, Gerd Wameling as the Officiant, and Christine Utterberg as Virginia Bradford. Engine Twinkomplex runs on an engine which was developed in-house for the unique needs of the game. The engine needed to be more sophisticated than previous platforms in order to allow for the complexity and transmediality of the game.

Early life He was born November 3, 1898, near Freetown, Jackson County, Indiana, the second child of Sarah Jane and Asbury Hill Manuel. His paternal grandfather, Dr. Grafton Manuel, was the attending physician at his birth. Thomas had two sisters Estella (1893–94) and Mary Catherine (1903-1935)as well as four brothers Virgil(1886-1957) Herschel (1887-1957) William (1891-1970) and Paul (1895-1925) Seeking adventure and angered by Pancho Villa's raid on a New Mexico town, at 17, he enlisted in the army, and saw action in the Mexican Expedition of 1916, remaining in the army afterward, he eventually saw action in France during World War I. Following his discharge from the army, Manuel attended the University of Illinois, earning a degree in animal husbandry, and setting out start a farm in Palm Beach County, Florida, near modern-day Delray Beach. He would ultimately settle further south, in Fort Lauderdale, where he and his wife Margaret would start a family. Daughter Ann was born in 1926. A second child died as an infant. Son and namesake Thomas Brown Manuel, Junior, was born in 1928. Civic leadership To house their growing family, the Manuels bought a house at 543 Victoria Park Road from William Reed, a prominent South Florida pioneer and politician. Reed and Manuel became close friends, with Reed serving as mentor to Manuel, who he admired for his vigorous, pioneering spirit. Reed encouraged Manuel's increasing involvement in the civic affairs of Fort Lauderdale. In time, Manuel would be elected to the Fort Lauderdale City Commission, and would serve a two-years term as mayor beginning in 1937. Returning to farming and other business interests after his service as mayor, following the Fall of France in 1940, Manuel foresaw the United States' eventual involvement in World War II. He set about positioning himself as well as he could for wartime service, reëntering the military and obtaining a commission later tha year. In time, he would serve with the 77th Infantry Division in the Pacific, seeing combat at Guam, Leyte Gulf, and Iwo Jima. In 1945, Manuel, who had been promoted to full colonel and would lead troops as they spent 45 consecutive days aboard ship under near-daily kamikaze attack before participating in an amphibious landing on Okinawa, gaining valuable experience in logistics and overseeing construction projects under deadline. Finally retiring from the army in 1946, Colonel Manuel returned to Fort Lauderdale, and resumed his involvement in public affairs, joining and serving as an officer in local Rotary and Kiwanis organizations, as well as supporting various political causes. He began a \\"second career\\" as a banking executive, eventually helping found and serving as a director at five separate banks, including Barnett Bank of Port Everglades (later Barnett Bank of Broward County), part of the Barnett banking enterprise that would eventually become the largest in the state, and be known as \\"Florida's Bank\\". Barnett would, in time, become part of NationsBank, which ultimately became Bank of America, the largest bank in the world. Statewide politics and the turnpike In 1952, seeking to end rural northern Florida's long dominance of state political affairs, Manuel and other like-minded leaders from the southern part of the state backed Dan McCarty, a young grovesman, fellow World War II veteran, and former speaker of the state house of representatives for governor. McCarty, ran on a platform of reform and economic progress, and was elected easily. Unfortunately, he was felled by a massive heart attack only a few months into his term, before he had much opportunity to accomplish the goals his supporters hoped for. Dismayed by the political antics of McCarty's successor, Acting Governor Charley Johns, in the 1954 special election, Manuel and others supported LeRoy Collins, a patrician North Floridian of unquestioned integrity who promised to support the economic development throughout the state. In the early 1950s Manuel had met another south Florida businessman, Charles \\"Charlie\\" Costar, who had convinced him of the need for a new road from the state line to south Florida, one that by-passed many of the sleepy beach towns that dot Florida's east coast. Largely due to Costar's lobbying efforts, the state legislature had passed the Florida Turnpike Act in 1953, and then-Governor McCarty signed it into law - one of the few important measures he lived long enough to enact. During the interregnum of Charley John's acting governorship, the project largely languished. During the 1955 legislative session (the first during newly elected Governor LeRoy Collins' administration) there was a concerted effort to repeal the Turnpike Act and abolish the entire project, led by North Florida legislators known as the Pork Chop Gang. Having been appointed chairman of the Florida Turnpike Authority (the program's governing agency) in January 1955 by Governor Collins in one of his first official acts, Manuel almost single-handedly turned the situation around, holding forth in his suite in Tallahassee's Floridan Hotel, winning legislators over one by one. By the end of the 1955 legislative session, due almost entirely to Manuel's unstinting efforts, the bill to kill the Turnpike had been defeated 36-4, the original law had actually been amended to extend the planned route of the new road by another 110 miles from Fort Pierce to Miami, and a $70 million bond issue had been authorized to finance the first stage of construction. Father of the turnpike Colonel Manuel served as chairman of the Turnpike Authority from 1955 to 1961. During his tenure, the first phase of construction began on July 4, 1955. However, by late 1956, owing to the Federal government's announced plans for a comprehensive interstate network of highways which would become the Interstate Highway System, and which was to include a route down Florida's east coast, designated I-95, which largely duplicated the Turnpike's originally-contemplated \\"Coastal Route\\" from Jacksonville to Fort Pierce, all work on the Turnpike stopped, and plans for further construction were shelved. Ironically, construction had begun at what was expected to be the southern terminus of what was officially known as the Sunshine State Parkway, rather than near the (northern) state line, meaning the only portion to be completed before the hiatus was the 110 mile stretch between Fort Pierce and Miami - the extension Manuel had proposed and won approval for during the 1955 legislative session. The ribbon-cutting ceremony was held January 25, 1957. Throughout the greater part of his service on the Turnpike Authority, Chairman Manuel was forced to contend with vigorous opposition from diverse segments of the political world, including those who felt it was a waste of tax dollars, rural interests unenthusiastic about devoting resources to a project seen as largely benefiting urban areas, tourism-based interests in the coastal towns of the counties between St. Augustine and Fort Lauderdale, railroad lines, and others. Nonetheless, he managed to coble together sufficient support to keep the Turnpike alive during those years when the project he and Charlie Costar had championed seemed unlikely to ever be completed as it had been envisioned. From time to time, Chairman Manuel even managed to move things forward, if incrementally. Despite his initial disinclination to go forward with additional construction on the Turnpike, Governor Collins acknowledged the need for an extension of the Sunshine State Parkway that would connect Fort Pierce (and the under- construction I-95) with Orlando (and the proposed I-4 and I-75). The extension was approved in May, 1959. Later, near the end of his service on the Authority, another extension, adding 156 miles and connecting Orlando and Wildwood, would be approved. Days before both he and Manuel would leave office, Governor Collins authorized the sale of an additional $80 million in bonds to finance construction to Wildwood. That section would be dedicated July 24, 1964, and would mark the completion of the \\"Main Line\\" portion of the Parkway running from Miami to Wildwood. During his time as chairman, Colonel Manuel deliberately took an active role in the management of the Turnpike, frequently driving to various destinations, visiting construction sites, and inspecting land parcels under consideration for acquisition, talking to road construction workers and managers and motorists. On one notable occasion, witnessing an accident, he quickly pulled to the side of the road and dove into a canal, dragging the wrecked cars occupants from the murky water in what, sadly, turned out to be futile efforts to save their lives. Later life and continued service Leaving the chairmanship and the Turnpike Authority in 1961, Colonel Manuel resumed his banking interests, relocating to Plantation, Florida, a Fort Lauderdale suburb with a slower pace than the \\"big city\\". A plaque memorializing Manuel's service to the State of Florida, and his successes as chairman of the Turnpike Authority marks the approach to the Thomas B. Manuel Bridge, which carries the Turnpike over the St. Lucie Canal, near Port Salerno, in east central Martin County. The plaque, near Mile Marker 130, officially recognizes Colonel Manuel as the \\"Father of the Turnpike\\". Following his wife's death in 1981, he began to spend less and less time working, eventually settling into full retirement. Still, years later, well into his retirement, Colonel Manuel continued to maintain an active interest in the affairs of the Turnpike, following developments affecting the system closely, often attending hearings and meetings, and frequently speaking publicly on issues pertaining to the Turnpike, as would be expected of someone referred to as \\"Mister Turnpike\\". Death At age 88, While attending a public hearing in Coconut Creek, and speaking vigorously against proposed toll increases, Colonel Manuel suffered a heart attack, collapsed, and was rushed to a hospital. He died soon thereafter, on August 13, 1987.

He composed the Christmas cantata in Leipzig in 1724 for the Third Day of Christmas and first performed it on 27 December 1724. The chorale cantata is based on the 1697 hymn by Caspar Ziegler.  History and words  Bach wrote the chorale cantata in his second year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, as part of his second cantata cycle, for the Third Day of Christmas. The prescribed readings for the feast day were from the Epistle to the Hebrews, Christ is higher than the angels, () and the prologue of the Gospel of John, also called Hymn to the Word (). The cantata is based on the chorale in four stanzas (1697) by Caspar Ziegler. It is one of the newest of the chorales which served as a base for the second annual cycle, whereas Bach otherwise preferred the beloved hymns of poets such as Martin Luther and Paul Gerhardt. The unknown poet of the cantata text retained the first and the last stanza, and paraphrased the inner stanzas closely to a sequence of recitative and aria. The text has no reference to the readings nor to the feast of John the Evangelist. It expresses the intimate joy of the individual believer about the presence of God in the Jesus child. Bach first performed the cantata on 27 December 1724. Bach's successor Johann Friedrich Doles performed the cantata after Bach's death.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in six movements is scored for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass), a four- part choir, cornett to double the chorale melody, two oboes d'amore, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. # Chorus: # Aria (alto): # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (soprano): # Recitative (bass): # Chorale:  Music  The chorale is sung on a variant of a melody of . This melody was probably new to Bach who noted it in the score of the Sanctus, which he also composed for Christmas in 1724 and later made part of his Mass in B minor. The cornetto plays the cantus firmus with the soprano, the oboes play with violin II and viola, whereas violin 1 \\"shines above the rest\\". The lower voices are set mostly in homophony, with the exception of expressing \\"\\" (the great son of God). John Eliot Gardiner summarizes: \\"I find it hard to imagine music that conveys more persuasively the essence, the exuberance and the sheer exhilaration of Christmas than the opening chorus of BWV 133\\". While Bach's Weimar cantata , expressed a communal joy in two choral movements and two duets, a sequence of four movements for a single voice reflects the joy of the individual believer. The alto aria is accompanied by the two oboi d'amore, the soprano aria by the strings, changing from an even time in the outer sections to a siciliano in the middle section. The tenor recitative is marked adagio twice, once to stress \\"\\" (Almighty God Himself here visits us), finally to quote from the chorale in both words and music \\"\\" (He has become a little child and is called my little Jesus). The cantata is closed by a four-part setting of the last chorale stanza.  Recordings  * J. S.

The organisers of this competition had also received the permission to reestablish the SFV from the US authorities. Below the Oberliga, the not yet officially reestablished SFV degreed that Landesligas were to be established for each of the states.100 Jahre Süddeutscher Fussball-Verband, p. 15-16 On 4 November 1945, the new Oberliga played its first round.100 Jahre Süddeutscher Fussball-Verband, p. 16 The clubs from South Baden however were outside this framework, playing in their own league system instead and than playing a French zone championship with the champions form the northern half of the occupation zone, from what was to become the state of Rhineland-Palatinate.100 Jahre Süddeutscher Fussball-Verband, p. 53 The Südbadischer Fußball-Verband was formed on 12 December 1948 in Freiburg im Breisgau in a meeting of 293 clubs.100 Jahre Süddeutscher Fussball-Verband, p. 53 To alleviate any friction between the Southern German and the state association, the state associations became a member of the SFV but the football clubs remained members of their state associations only, not the SFV. The SFV had the responsibility to organise the Oberliga and the new 2nd Oberliga, all other leagues were part of their state associations.100 Jahre Süddeutscher Fussball-Verband, p. 17 In 1950, the clubs from South Baden returned to the Southern German federation, ending the era of the French Zone championship. The best clubs from the region, SSV Reutlingen and FC Singen 04, were grupped in the Oberliga Süd while Freiburger FC and FC Konstanz entered the new second division 2. Oberliga Süd. Reutlingen is now not part of the SBFV anymore, having joined the Württemberg FA instead. In 1951 merger talks were held with the Baden FA to have one federation for the hole state of Baden and terms were agreed on but the merger was never implemented and the separation of Baden football continues to this day.100 Jahre Süddeutscher Fussball-Verband, p. 54 In 1978, the association, like Württemberg and Baden, implemented a reform of its league system. The historical league system, with the Amateurliga Südbaden as the top league, the third division, followed by the 2nd Amateurliga, the A-Klasse, B-Klasse and C-Klasse was replaced with the Verbandsliga Südbaden, now the fourth division, followed by the Landesliga, Bezirksliga, Kreisliga and Kreisliga B.100 Jahre Süddeutscher Fussball-Verband, p. 54 Member statistics As of 2017, the SBFV has 272,181 members, 715 member clubs and 5,715 football teams played within its league system.

At the time of its description the new genus comprised a single species Vetufebrus ovatus known from a single Miocene Dominican amber fossil found on Hispaniola. V. ovatus was vectored by Enischnomyia stegosoma, the first fossil steblid bat fly described from a fossil, and the only member of the subfamily Nycterophiliinae described from Hispaniola. V. ovatus is the first instance of a Streblidae bat fly as a host for a malarial parasite. History and classification Vetufebrus ovatus was described based on a group of fossilized specimens which are preserved as in the host batfly, itself an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Dominican amber. The amber is fossil resin that was produced by the extinct Hymenaea protera, which formerly grew on Hispaniola, across northern South America and up to southern Mexico. The amber dates from the Burdigalian stage (20.43 ± 0.05 to 15.97 ± 0.05 million years ago) of the Miocene, and is recovered from sections of the La Toca Formation in the Cordillera Septentrional and the Yanigua Formation in the Cordillera Oriental. The amber specimen was collected from the LaBúcara amber mine in the Dominican Republic. At the time of description, the holotype specimen, number \\"No. D-7-239\\", was preserved in the Poinar Amber collections, housed at Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon. The holotype fossil was first studied by entomologist George Poinar Jr. of Oregon State University with his 2011 type description of the new genus and species being published in the journal Parasites & Vectors. The genus name, Vetufebrus was derived from a combination of the Latin words vetus meaning \\"old\\" and febris meaning \\"fever\\". The specific epithet ovatus was coined from the Latin word ovatus meaning \\"ovate\\", an allusion to the shape of the oocysts. Paleobiology and parasite vectoring Male Enischnomyia stegosoma; arrows indicate oocysts Extant bat malaria causing plasmodiids are transmitted by species of the bat fly family Nycteribiidae, with no recorded association between living malaria plasmodiids and streblid bat flies. Of the four genera of bat malaria Hepatocystis, Nycteria, Plasmodium, and Polychromophilus, the first three are confined to old world bats, and only Polychromophilus is present in the new world. Vetufebrus ovatus oocysts are preserved in the mid gut of Enischnomyia stegosoma and sporozoites are present in the oocysts along with in the salivary ducts. The sporozoites preserved in the salivary glands and ducts are similar in size to those in the oocysts, which indicate that V. ovatus was successfully vectored to the flies host. The infection association was the first instance of a Streblidae family bat fly acting as host and vector for a malarial parasite. The oocysts of V. ovatus are smaller and ovoid in shape while mature Polychromophilus species oocysts are rounded and larger overall. Poinar notes that the oocysts in V. ovatus might have been immature, and the sporozoites in the salivary ducts could have been left from a prior infection. The overall sporozoite morphology is similar to those of Polychromophilus species, suggesting the possibility of Vetufebrus being an early linage for Polychromophilus, though the oocysts are not consistent. The amber entombing V. ovatus and E. stegosoma contains no preserved evidence of what its host animal may have been. However member species of Streblidae are bat parasites, with Nycterophiliinae subfamily species being obligate external parasites that feed on the blood of bats, so it is suggested E. stegosoma was the same. At least two bat fur fossils had been described from Dominican amber prior to the description of E. stegosoma. A larval Nymphalidae brush-footed butterfly with a single hair stuck to a rear spine was described in 1998, with the hair noted to be similar to those of the bat genus Eptesicus. In 2005 additional bat hairs were reported in the amber specimen entombing the extinct kissing-bug Triatoma dominicana, its-self a host to the extinct Trypanosoma antiquus. Description Both the oocysts are a brown in coloration and are between long by wide. Both oocysts have a thin surrounding membrane, multiple dark colored cells with nuclei and a number of developing sporozoites. The sporozoites in the oocysts range between , while the sporocytes in the salvary glands are slightly latrger, and have a rounded stubby outline.

František Emmert (born 1974) is author of books about modern European and Czech history.  Biography  František Emmert was born in 1974 in Brno (Czech Republic) into the family of František Gregor Emmert, a music composer and professor at the Janáček Academy of Music and Performing Arts. His father's family came from the town of Weiden in Bavaria, and his mother's family from Teplice in Bohemia. His paternal ancestors worked for generations as glass makers on the German side of the Šumava Mountains (Bohemian Forest). His mother came from a family of traders who owned a family confectioner's shop in Teplice before 1948. After graduating from high school, František Emmert studied history and religious studies at the Faculty of Arts of Masaryk University in Brno. In 2011 he obtained the title Doctor of law at the Faculty of Law of Charles University in Prague. From 1992-2006 he worked as a journalist, broadcaster and book editor. He passed through Czech Radio, the newspapers Rovnost, Právo and ZNnoviny/Slovo and Czech News Agency. From 2009-2011 he worked as a spokesperson for the Supreme Administrative Court in Brno. He started writing books in 2001. His first two works of fiction were published in 2003 and 2004, and he then started writing non-fiction works about modern European and Czech history. In 2005 the Vyšehrad publishing house published his first non-fiction book, Czechs in the Wehrmacht, which was soon reprinted. Many narrative publications followed - called museums in a book - that discuss the key events of the 20th century, focusing mainly on European and Czech history. These publications in large format differ from classical books due to their more elaborate graphic design and legibility of the texts. They contain a large number of photographs, and separately printed appendices - facsimiles of archival material and DVDs with contemporary radio broadcasts. They are used as teaching aids in schools. As of 2012, Emmert has released nine books of this sort, some of which have been reprinted, won awards or been translated into English (The Holocaust). The publication Fateful Eights in Our History was awarded the E. E. Kisch Prize by the Association of Writers in 2009. Emmert is an author of thirty books (2018), including technical legal literature. He is the co-author of a high school textbook on social science and an author of commentaries and journalistic contributions in the daily press and expert articles and studies in the domains of history, law and international politics in technical papers and in collections. He contributed as an expert adviser on the preparation of the 2011 Czech historical film Lidice.

Giorgio Interiano was the first Western traveler to document their customs. Giorgio Interiano (fl. 15th century) was a Genovese traveler, historian and ethnographer. His travelogue La vita: & sito de Zichi, chiamiti ciarcassi: historia notabileLa vita, et sito de Zychi, chiamati Ciarcassi, Historia notabile, Venezia, Aldo Manuzio, 1502, Italian Wikisource was among the first European accounts of the life and customs of the Circassian people.  Life  Little is known about Interiano's personal life. He served as the governor of Corsica in 1496. He also lived in Naples and traveled throughout Asia before finally settling in Venice, where he became friends with many influential citizens of the city, whose connections would prove beneficial for his career as a travel writer. The poet Angelo Poliziano (1454-1494) called Interiano, with whom he had worked for a number of years, \\"magnus naturalium rerum investigator,\\" or \\"learned seeker into recondite matter.\\"  Notable work  Interiano was the author of one of the first Europe descriptions of Circassia, a book called La vita: & sito de Zichi, chiamiti ciarcassi: historia notabile. It was published by Aldus Manutius in Venice in 1502, though it probably describes events that occurred in the second half of the 14th century. The book was uncharacteristic of the works usually printed by Manutius, but Interiano's friendship with Jacopo Sannazaro, a famed poet of the time, may have influenced Manutius to accept and publish it anyway. Interiano's account is considered to be more \\"learned\\" than other travelogues of the time, though it is still fits into the Orientalist idiom, the texts of which tend to focus on the exotic and savage character of all natives of Asia. For example, Interiano claimed that it was the custom of Circassian princes to hunt animals \\"and even people.\\" Circassian priests, he wrote, were \\"ignorant, illiterate men performing the Greek ritual without any knowledge of the language,\\" and \\"nobles never entered a church until they were sixty years of age, because, as they lived by rapine, they were deemed to desecrate the sacred edifices.\\" In spite of the more colorful aspects of the account, Interiano was still a dedicated ethnographer and detailed many important Circassian customs, including their distinct burial ritual of disemboweling men of high rank who had died and seating them outdoors on a tall pile of timber, a custom also described by Herodotus in his account of Scythian funerals. The book was reprinted several times in Europe and in Russia. In 1830, M.V. Semenov published the text in the first volume of his Library of the foreign writers of Russia.

It is used as a precursor in the production of a variety of chemical commodities such as the local anesthetic procaine. It can be reacted with 4-aminobenzoic acid to make procaine. DEAE can be used as a precursor for DEAE-cellulose resin, which is commonly used in ion exchange chromatography. DEAE can also be conveniently obtained from renewable sources. It is chemically stable and able to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from its surroundings. In solution, it can decrease the surface tension of water when the temperature is increased.

He attended Clearwater Central Catholic High School and graduated in 1986. He then attended Stanford University, graduating with a bachelor's degree in computer science in 1990.http://www.ccchs.org/ccc-alumni-joe- belfiore-86-microsoft-vp-visits-ccc/ Career at Microsoft Windows and IE user experience Soon after graduation he was hired by Microsoft, working as Program Manager for OS/2, but his post was short-lived as Microsoft ended its partnership with IBM regarding OS/2. He moved over to the Windows NT team. Belfiore served as user interface manager for NT during its development. In 1993 as NT shipped he joined the Windows team and became Lead Program Manager for the user interface of project Chicago, which would become Windows 95. Following this, he worked on user interface for Internet Explorer 3 and Internet Explorer 4, including IE4's Windows integrated shell.

Introduced in the 1960s, the Mk.6 has been installed in combat and training aircraft worldwide. History The Mk.6 seat was developed from the earlier Mk.4 design by the addition of a rocket pack to enable zero-zero capability.Martin-Baker Mk.6 fact sheets www.martin-baker.com Retrieved: 15 December 2011 A variant of the Mk.6 was fitted with a compressed air cylinder crew breathing system to provide underwater ejection capability for the carrier-borne Blackburn Buccaneer aircraft.Philpott 1989, p. 4. Operation sequence Operating either the seat pan or face blind firing handles initiates aircraft canopy jettison, as the canopy clears an interlock is removed which allows the main gun located at the rear of the seat to fire, the main gun is a telescopic tube with two explosive charges that fire in sequence. As the seat moves up its guide rails an emergency oxygen supply is activated and personal equipment tubing and communication leads are automatically disconnected, leg restraints also operate. As the seat moves further up and out of the aircraft the rocket pack is fired by a lanyard attached to the cockpit floor. A steel rod, known as the drogue gun, is fired and extracts two small parachutes to stabilise the seat's descent path. A barostatic mechanism prevents the main parachute from opening above an altitude of 10,000 ft (3,000 m) A time delay mechanism operates the main parachute below this altitude in conjunction with another device to prevent the parachute opening at high speed. The seat then separates from the occupant for a normal parachute descent, a manual separation handle is provided should the automatic system fail.

Many people use a house clearance service because they may need a lot of items removing or looking to clear garages, lofts, sheds and basements.  What is a house clearance?  A house clearance is the process of removing all of the household items from a property. Some house clearances can take more than a day if there is a large amount of household furniture and effects, sometimes when the occupant has been suffering from OCD or compulsive hoarding syndrome.  Costs involved  When a house is cleared there are many costs associated with the job and vary depending on the items cleared. Many councils across the UK operate a strict policy which must be adhered to.\\"Developers Regret\\", Kent and Sussex Courier, by Mary Harris, 2 June 2014 Example items. These have to be cleared in a safe way. * asbestos * pesticides * fluorescent tubes * oils * some paints * some household and car batteries * discarded electrical equipment like TVs and computer monitors, fridges and freezers * discarded energy saving light bulbs (also known as CFLs) * mattresses * plasterboard * car tyres A standard house of 3 to 4 bedrooms with an average amount of household furniture and effects can cost anywhere between £650 and £1,500 on average but can vary considerably based upon various factors such as, parking difficulty, high rise flats with only stair access, and high volume content within the property. There may be a garden clearance involved and this would incur additional charges. Garages can sometimes have large quantities of toxic material such as paint and garden pesticides which will also incur additional charges. The loft area can sometimes have large amounts of clutter and the house clearance company will have to take this into consideration when working out a quotation. The Directgov advises that these items are put into your car and taken to your local waste management centre; also known as a 'tip' or 'dump'. Due to recent changes made at recycling centres nationwide there is now a charge for the disposal of plasterboard and mattresses, and these items have to be separated from the general waste. This extra charge has therefore been passed on to the client or person having a property cleared  Licensing  It is important that companies who operate a clearance service be registered waste carriers with the Environment Agency. The home owner can obtain this license by asking the business who is quoting for the job to produce one, or you can check the validity of the licence on the Environment Agency website.

New technologies are developed and co-exist with the old before supplanting them. Transport offers several examples; from sailing to steam ships to automobiles replacing horse-based transportation. Technological transitions (TT) describe how these technological innovations occur and are incorporated into society. Alongside the technological developments TT considers wider societal changes such as “user practices, regulation, industrial networks (supply, production, distribution), infrastructure, and symbolic meaning or culture”.Geels, F. W., 2002. Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: a multi- level perspective and a case study. Research Policy 31 pp. 257-1273 For a technology to have use, it must be linked to social structures human agency and organisations to fulfil a specific need. HughesHughes, T.P., 1987. The evolution of large technological systems. In: Bijker, W.E., Hughes, T.P., Pinch, T. (Eds.), The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology. Cambridge (MA): MIT Press. pp. 51-82 refers to the ‘seamless web’ where physical artefacts, organisations, scientific communities, and social practices combine. A technological system includes technical and non-technical aspects, and it a major shift in the socio-technical configurations (involving at least one new technology) is when a technological transition occurs.Fleck, J., 1993. ‘Configurations: Crystallizing Contingency’, The International Journal of Human Factors in Manufacturing, 3, pp. 15-36 Origins Work on technological transitions draws on a number of fields including history of science, technology studies, and evolutionary economics. The focus of evolutionary economics is on economic change, but as a driver of this technological change has been considered in the literature.Geels, F.W., 2005. Technological transitions and system innovations. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar Publishing. Joseph Schumpeter, in his classic Theory of Economic DevelopmentSchumpeter, T., 1934. The theory of economic development: an inquiry into profits, capital, credit, interest, and the business cycle. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press placed the emphasis on non-economic forces as the driver for growth. The human actor, the entrepreneur is seen as the cause of economic development which occurs as a cyclical process. Schumpeter proposed that radical innovations were the catalyst for Kondratiev cycles. Long wave theory The Russian economist KondratievKondratiev, N., 1925. Major Economic Cycles. Moscow. proposed that economic growth operated in boom and bust cycles of approximately 50 year periods. These cycles were characterised by periods of expansion, stagnation and recession. The period of expansion is associated with the introduction of a new technology, e.g. steam power or the microprocessor. At the time of publication, Kondratiev had considered that two cycles had occurred in the nineteenth century and third was beginning at the turn of the twentieth. Modern writers, such as Freeman and PerezFreeman, C. and Perez, C., 1988. Structural crisis of adjustment, business cycles and investment behaviour in Dosi et al Technical Change and Economic Theory. London: Frances Pinter. pp. 38-66. outlined five cycles in the modern age: * The Industrial Revolution (1770–1830) * Victorian Prosperity: Age of steam and Rail (1830–1880) * The Age of Steel (1880–1930) * Oil, Mass Production and the Consumer Society (1930–1980) * The Information Age (1980-?) Freeman and Perez proposed that each cycle consists of pervasive technologies, their production and economic structures that support them. Termed ‘techno-economic paradigms’, they suggest that the shift from one paradigm to another is the result of emergent new technologies. Following the recent economic crisis, authors such as Moody and NogradyMoody, J.B., and Nogrady, B., 2011. The Sixth Wave: How to Succeed in a Resource-Limited World. New York: Random House have suggested that a new cycle is emerging from the old, centred on the use of sustainable technologies in a resource depleted world. Technological paradigms, trajectories and regimes Thomas KuhnKuhn, T., 1962. The structure of scientific revolutions. Chicago; London : University of Chicago Press described how a paradigm shift is a wholesale shift in the basic understanding of a scientific theory. Examples in science include the change of thought from miasma to germ theory as a cause of disease. Building on this work, Giovanni DosiDosi, G., 1982. Technological paradigms and technological trajectories. Research Policy 11 (3) pp. 147-162. developed the concept of ’technical paradigms’ and ‘technological trajectories’. In considering how engineers work, the technical paradigm is an outlook on the technological problem, a definition of what the problems and solutions are. It charts the idea of specific progress. By identifying the problems to be solved the paradigm exerts an influence on technological change. The pattern of problem solving activity and the direction of progress is the technological trajectory. In similar fashion, Nelson and Winter (,Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1977. In search of useful theory of innovation. Research Policy 6 (1) pp. 36-76Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1982. An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change. Cambridge (MA); Bellknap Press.)defined the concept of the ‘technological regime’ which directs technological change through the beliefs of engineers of what problems to solve. The work of the actors and organisations is the result of organisational and cognitive routines which determines search behaviour. This places boundaries and also trajectories (direction) to those boundaries. Multi-level perspective (MLP) on technological transitions Socio- technical systems and transitions Recently, the scope of academic sustainability discourse and investigative focus has broadened beyond the study of technological products, innovations and subsequent transitions (Geels 2005). Much of the literature now examines technological artefacts and innovations through a wider scope of socio-technical systems (Geels 2018). It has been argued that this contemporary framework has emerged in response to both an increased understanding of the urgency of environmental problems and the recognition that more substantiative transitions are required across multiple interdependent systems to mitigate impacts (Geels 2010). The technological transitions framework does acknowledge the co-evolution and mutual unfolding of societal change alongside technological innovation. However, the socio-technical transitions framework considers a more encompassing view of the interdependent links that technology maintains with systems that both generate the need for new innovations and ultimately produce and maintain them (.Geels 2005, 2010) More specifically, the systems that comprise the socio-technical paradigm include technology, supply networks, infrastructure, maintenance networks, regulation, cultural meaning as well as user practices and markets (Geels 2018, Geels 2005). As such, socio-technical transitions can be defined as the multi-dimensional shift from one socio- technical system to another involving changes in both technological and social systems that are intrinsically linked in a feedback loop (Geels 2005). Generally speaking, socio-technical transitions are a slow process as technological innovation tends to occur incrementally along fixed trajectories due to the rigidity of economic, social, cultural, infrastructural and regulative norms (Geels 2005, Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014). This is referred to as path dependency, creating technological ‘lock-ins’ which prevent innovation that disrupts the status quo (Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014). Therefore, the breakthrough and dissemination of technological innovations is dependent on more than their respective benefits, providing an insight into the complexity of the forces and multiple dimensions at play. Multi-level perspective (MLP) framework The multi-level perspective (MLP) is an analytical tool that attempts to deal with this complexity and resistance to change. Focussing on the dynamics of wider transitionary developments as opposed to discrete technological innovations, the MLP concerns itself with socio-technical system transformations, particularly with transitions towards sustainability and resilience (Geels 2010, Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014). As the name implies, the MLP posits three analytical and heuristic levels on which processes interact and align to result in socio-technical system transformations; landscape (macro-level), regimes (meso-level) and niches (micro-level) (Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014, Geels 2018). Firstly, the regime level represents the current structures and practices characterised by dominant rules, institutions and technologies that are self-reinforcing (Geels 2010, 2018, Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014). The socio-technical regime is dynamically stable in the sense that innovation still transpires albeit incrementally and along a predictable trajectory (Geels 2005). This makes the regime ‘locked-in’ and resistant to both technological and social transitions (Kemp, Schot, and Hoogma 1998, Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014). Secondly, the landscape level is defined as the exogenous, broader contextual developments in deep-seated cultural patterns, macro-economics, macro-politics and spatial structures, potentially arising from shocks associated with wars, economic crisis, natural disaster and political upheaval (Geels 2018, Geels 2005, Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014). Additionally, landscapes are beyond the direct influence of actors, yet stimulate and exert pressure on them at the regime and niche levels. Finally, the niche is defined as the “locus for radical innovations” where dedicated actors nurture the development of technological novelties (Geels 2010, Geels 2005). Incubated from market and regulation influences, the niche fosters innovations that differ fundamentally from the prevailing regime and usually require landscape developments that open windows of opportunity in at the regime level (Geels 2005, Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014). Therefore, the MLP attributes socio-technical transitions to the interaction of stabilising forces at the regime level with destabilising forces from both the landscape and niche levels (Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014). MLP application - automobility regime Due to the systems approach inherent in the MLP, analysis can be approached from different disciplinary perspectives according to their respective ontologies and priorities. From an urban planning perspective, the framework could be used to pinpoint the barriers and drivers associated with low carbon transport systems to better target policy efforts (Moradi and Vagnoni 2018). To begin, from an urban mobility perspective, the landscape level is currently pressured by both stabilising and destabilising pressures. Namely, Peak Oil, public concern surrounding inaction towards climate change mitigation and information technologies that digitise daily life (e.g. tele-commuting) destabilises the landscape and automobility regime (Geels 2012, Moradi and Vagnoni 2018). Conversely, the landscape level is solidified by stabilising forces such as cultural preferences for private ownership, timesaving, autonomy and privacy, as well as car-favouring urban fabric and infrastructure (Geels 2012). This is further enhanced by universal pressures of globalisation which presupposes urban mobility to increase flows of goods and people (Geels 2012, Moradi and Vagnoni 2018). This tension between stabilising and destabilising forces is mirrored in the prevailing automobility regime. The regime is stabilised by persistent investment in road projects, lifestyle norms and consumer preferences that perpetuate car use and resistance to major change by vested actors such as transport planners, policy makers and industry actors (e.g. car manufactures) (Geels 2012). Despite this stability, shifts in the landscape has allowed “cracks” in the regime such as traffic management policy (traffic calming, parking restrictions, etc.), diminishing policy commitment to the regime and industry actors proclaiming awareness of landscape pressures associated with climate change (Geels 2012). In these contexts, niche socio-technical innovations that challenge the assumptions and norms of the regime have been birthed, mainly in the form of local policy and infrastructure initiatives on a city-scale. For example, intermodal travel in the form of bus/bike-rail integration schemes, bike rental/sharing have been trialled in many cities globally (Geels 2012). Also, niche sustainable urban planning concepts such as compact cities, smart growth and transit-oriented development have modestly emerged into sustainably mobility discourse (Geels 2012). However, the persistence of the automobility regime due to the general stability of the landscape has resulted in limited, small-scale implementations of these niche innovations (Geels 2012). As such, prevailing user preference and cultural values at the landscape level appear to be a major barrier in transport system socio-technical transitions, as they stabilise the automobility regime, disallowing niche innovations to gain a foothold. Transition paths The nature of transitions varies and the differing qualities result in multiple pathways occurring. Geels and Schot Geels, F.W. and Schot, J.W., 2007, 'Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways , Research Policy, 36 (3), pp.399-417 defined five transition paths: * Reproduction: Ongoing change occurring in the regime level. * Transformation: A socio-technical regime that changes without the emergence of a monopolising technology. * Technological substitution: An incumbent technology is replaced by a radical innovation resulting in a new socio- technical regime. * De-alignment and Re-alignment: Weaknesses in the regime sees the advent of competing new technologies leading to a dominant model. (E.g. the automobile replacing the horse as the primary means of land transport). * Re-configuration: When multiple, interlinked technologies are replaced by a similarly linked alternative set. Characteristics of technological transitions Six characteristics of technological transitions have been identified.,Geels, F., Monaghan, A., Eames, M. and Steward, F. , 2008. The feasibility of systems thinking in sustainable consumption and production policy: a report to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London: DEFRA. Transitions are co-evolutionary and multi-dimensional Technological developments occur intertwined with societal needs, wants and uses. A technology is adopted and diffused based on this interplay between innovation and societal requirements. Co-evolution has different aspects. As well as the co-evolution of technology and society, aspects between science, technology, users and culture have been considered. Multi-actors are involved Scientific and engineering communities are central to the development of a technology, but a wide range of actors are involved in a transition. This can include organisations, policy-makers, government, NGOs, special interest groups and others. Transitions occur at multiple levels As shown in the MLP, transitions occur through the interplay of processes at different levels. Transitions are a long-term process Complete system-change takes time and can be decades in the making. Case studies show them to be between 40 and 90 years.Genus , A., and Coles, A-M., 2008. Rethinking the multi-level perspective of technological transitions. Research Policy. 37 (9) pp. 1436-1445 Transitions are radical For a true transition to occur the technology has to be a radical innovation. Change is Non-linear The rate of change will vary over time. For example, the pace of change may be slow at the gestation period (at the niche level) but much more rapid when a breakthrough is occurring. Diffusion: transition phases Diffusion of an innovation is the concept of how it is picked up by society, at what rate and why.Everett (1962) The diffusion of a technological innovation into society can be considered in distinct phases.Rotmans, J., Kemp, R. and van Asselt, M. 2001. More evolution than revolution: transition management in public policy. Foresight, 3 (1) pp. 15–31. Pre-development is the gestation period where the new technology has yet to make an impact. Take-off is when the process of a system shift is beginning. A breakthrough is occurring when fundamental changes are occurring in existing structures through the interplay of economic, social and cultural forces. Once the rate of change has decreased and a new balance is achieved, stabilization is said to have occurred. A full transition involves an overhaul of existing rules and change of beliefs which takes time, typically spanning at least a generation. This process can be speeded up through seismic, unforeseen events such as war or economic strife. Geels proposed a similar four-phase approach which draws on the multi-level perspective (MLP) developed by Dutch scholars. Phase one sees the emergence of a novelty, born from the existing regime. Development then occurs in the niche level at phase two. As before, breakthrough then occurs at phase three. In the parlance of the MLP the new technology, having been developed at the niche level, is in competition with the established regime. To break through and achieve wide diffusion, external factors – ‘windows of opportunity’ – are required. Windows of opportunity A number of possible circumstances can act as windows of opportunity for the diffusion of new technologies: * Internal technical problems in the existing regime. Those that cannot be solved by refinement of existing technologies act as a driver for the new. * Problems external to the system. Such ‘problems’ are often determined by pressure groups and require wider societal or political backing. An example is environmental concerns. * Changing user preferences. Opportunities are presented if existing technologies cannot meet user needs. * Strategic advantage. Competition with rivals may necessitate innovation * Complementary technology. The availability of which may enable a breakthrough Alongside external influences, internal drivers catalyse diffusion. These include economic factors such as the price performance ration. Socio-technical perspectives focus on the links between disparate social and technological elements.Rip, A. and R. Kemp., 1998. Technological change. In S. Rayner and E. Malone (eds.) Human Choices and Climate Change, Vol. 2, 327-399. Battelle, Columbus,Ohio. Following the breakthrough, the final phases see the new technology supersede the old. Societal relevance The study of technological transitions has an impact beyond academic interest. The transitions referred to in the literature may relate to historic processes, such as the transportation transitions studied by Geels, but system changes are required to achieve a safe transition to a low carbon-economy. (). Current structural problems are apparent in a range of sectors. Dependency on oil is problematic in the energy sector due to availability, access and contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Transportation is a major user of energy causing significant emission of GHGs. Food production will need to keep pace with an ever-growing world population while overcoming challenges presented by global warming and transportation issues. Incremental change has provided some improvements but a more radical transition is required to achieve a more sustainable future. Developed from the work on technological transitions is the field of transition management. Within this is an attempt to shape the direction of change complex socio-technical systems to more sustainable patterns. Whereas work on technological transitions is largely based on historic processes, proponents of transition management seek to actively steer transitions in progress. Criticisms Genus and Coles outlined a number of criticisms against the analysis of technological transitions, in particular when using the MLP. Empirical research on technological transitions occurring now has been limited, with the focus on historic transitions. Depending on the perspective on transition case studies they could be presented as having occurred on a different transition path to what was shown. For example, the bicycle could be considered an intermediate transport technology between the horse and the car. Judged from shorter different time-frame this could appear a transition in its own right. Determining the nature of a transition is problematic; when it started and ended, or whether one occurred in the sense of a radical innovation displacing an existing socio-technical regime. The perception of time casts doubt on whether a transition has occurred. If viewed over a long enough period even inert regimes may demonstrate radical change in the end. The MLP has also been criticised by scholars studying sustainability transitions using Social Practice Theories.Shove E, Walker G, 2007, \\"CAUTION!

It integrates academics, youth development, family support, health and social services, and community development. Community schools are organized around the goals to help students learn and succeed and to strengthen families and communities. Full-service community schools extend the goals of traditional public schools further. They are centers of their communities that provide services to address the needs of student learners and build bridges between schools, families, and communities. They are schools that not only promote academic excellence, but they also provide health, mental health, and social services on the school campus. The \\"school emerges as a community hub, a one- stop center to meet diverse needs and to achieve the best possible outcomes for each child.\\"Dryfoos and Maguire 2002, p. 4. Description Samberg and Sheeran (2000) define community schools as \\"both a set of partnerships and a place where services, supports, and opportunities lead to improved student learning, stronger families, and healthier communities.\\"Samberg & Sheeran 2000, p. iv. Community schools transform traditional public schools into partnerships for excellence by being a place where partnerships between educators, families, community volunteers, youth development organizations, and business, health, and social agencies, can come together. The following definitions are attempts to clarify some terminology used in discussions around FSCSs. Linked services involve collaborative strategies, in which partners can share a vision, establish goals, and use resources to implement and deliver the services. School-linked services involve coordination with schools, families, and agencies located at or near the school. School-based services are more directly linked—physically and fiscally—to the school campus. The school becomes the vehicle to mobilize its surrounding community. The concept of full-service schools comes from Florida's 1991 innovative legislation, which called for theintegration of educational, medical, and social and/or human services in a way that meets the needs of youth and their families on school grounds or in easily accessible locations.Dryfoos & Maguire 2002, p. 19. According to Dryfoos and Maguire (2002), community schools include certain elements: \\"open all the time, run by a partnership, providing access to an array of services, responsive to the family and the community, and focused on overcoming barriers to learning.\\"Dryfoos and Maguire 2002, p. 18. The Five Conditions of Learning The Coalition for Community Schools (2003) has identified five conditions for learning that are essential for every child to succeed: # The school has a core instructional program with qualified teachers, a challenging curriculum, and high standards and expectations for students. # Students are motivated and engaged in learning—both in school and in community settings, during and after school. # The basic physical, mental, and emotional needs of young people and their families are recognized and addressed. # There is mutual respect and effective collaboration among parents, families and school staff. # Community engagement, together with school efforts, promote a school climate that is safe, supportive and respectful and that connects students to a broader learning community. In addition to focusing on the needs of students inside the school, the majority of these conditions focus on students' needs outside the school, with community support being an essential component. Components of FSCSs Given the five conditions of learning mentioned above, FSCSs can bring together a package of different components and services:Dryfoos & Maguire 2002, pp. 20-23. * Case management – Outside agencies, like Communities-in-Schools, can work with local businesses to bring in a range of services into schools, including mentoring, after-school programs, mental health counseling, career counseling and employment programs, and community service opportunities. * Primary health clinics – These facilities, operated in school buildings by outside health agencies, can provide primary health care, emergency care, dental examinations, mental health counseling, and health education. * Youth development programs – Some community schools put together a number of different youth activities, including mentoring, substance abuse counseling, sports and recreation, community service learning, and pre-employment services. * Family resource centers – Community schools can offer services for parents, such as parenting education, literacy, employment assistance, immigration information, housing help, food, clothing, case management, health services, and early child care. * Early childhood development – Early childhood programs, such as Head Start, can relocate into schools and can provide services including, all-day child care, after-school and vacation care, and family support and guidance through a home visitation program. * Referrals – School-based health centers and family resource centers can be the link that ensures that students and families' needs are met. * After-school programs – After-school programs are important for the effectiveness of schools by providing school-age children with academic and nonacademic support. Community School Examples A number of community school models have sprung up around the country. Dryfoos & Maguire (2002) list a number of them:Dryfoos & Maguire 2002, pp. 18-20. Beacon community schools bring nonprofit community-based organizations (CBOs) into schools to make use of extended school hours for youth development and community enrichment. Beacons, introduced in New York City through the Department of Youth and Community Development, are heavily involved with community service projects to help enhance the neighborhood.Dryfoos & Maguire 2002, pp. 18-19. County Cullen, a Beacon community school operated by the Rheedlen Centers in New York City, offers youth leadership opportunities, participates in a neighborhood beautification projects, and facilitates forums on community issues.Dryfoos & Maguire 2002, p. 55. The Children's Aid Society (CAS) has created community schools that are built on a close relationship between the school system and outside agencies and address both school restructuring and the provision of one-stop services. CAS also nationally provides technical assistance to community schools. In university-assisted community schools, university faculty members work with teachers on curriculum and with administrators on school restructuring. The University of Pennsylvania's West Philadelphia Improvement Corps is an example of a full-fledged community school, with extended hours and a range of one-stop services. The Elizabeth Learning Center in California is an example of a pre-K through Grade 12 community school, which has child and family support services integrated into the educational restructuring. It is a \\"collaborative effort between Los Angeles Unified School District, the teachers' union, a variety of community partners, and the New American Schools Development Corporation.Dryfoos & Maguire 2002, p. 51. Community Schools in Boston (CSIB) is an example of a model in which all Boston public schools are a part of this community schools vision. \\"The goal is to build a systemic approach to furthering and sustaining school-community ties and building strong partnerships within specific schools, communities and clusters (groups of schools).\\"Dryfoos & Maguire 2002, pp. 26-27 One difficulty that is mentioned with this approach is attempting to balance centralized planning with decentralized relationship building. Partnerships and Governance At the school site, the partnerships exist between principals, teachers, other school staff, and multiple community partners. Their goal is to create learning opportunities and services to help students develop academically, emotionally, physically, and socially. Additional partners with school site personnel are volunteers from public agencies, local government officials, non-profit agencies, community-based and faith-based organizations, philanthropies, businesses, and higher education personnel. Schools are the center of the community, and the shared resources lead to improved student learning, stronger families, and healthier communities. In many districts, partnerships develop greater community support for local schools by gathering resources, bringing in outside expertise, and providing services that the district cannot provide itself. The school is the primary player in the partnerships and collaborations, and the principal may act as the leader. Alternatively, the principal can act with a full-time coordinator who works for another agency. Out of the collective of partnerships between the school and community agencies, a lead agency often emerges, usually to extend the hours of the school and the scope of services provided.Dryfoos & Maguire 2002, p. 25. History of Full-Service Schools In the early 1900s, children living in poverty in the U.S. were predominantly from immigrant families. In 1889, Jane Addams established a Hull House in Chicago, which brought health and educational services to working families in immigrant neighborhoods. Addams's work, based on an English model, was founded on \\"the theory that social ills are interconnected and must be approached holistically.\\" John Dewey was influenced by Addams's work and adapted the social change philosophy to schools. Dewey stated, \\"The conception of the schools as a social center is born of our entire democratic movement.\\" By the early 20th Century, many cities began to recognize schools as social centers, and many states enacted legislation to allow communities to use school facilities more widely (e.g., as art galleries, movie theaters, local health offices). During the Great Depression, schools were seen as an investment and school facilities continued to be used for multiple purposes. In 1934, Leonard Cavello, an Italian immigrant living in East Harlem, established Benjamin Franklin High School and used the school community to address social problems, which was the first attempt to make the school the coordinator of social services. After World War II, the community school movement continued to expand, especially with the work of Charles Mott around bringing to youth recreation and school-linked health and social services to the school campus. Psychologists, school nurses, and social workers became an increasing part of the public school system between 1930 and 1960. President Johnson's Great Society initiatives focused on the country on the less fortunate, and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965 increased the federal government's role in education and education programming for the country's neediest students. The rise of the Head Start Program in 1965, \\"was a tacit acknowledgement by the government that schools alone are not enough to address the underlying problem of social poverty.\\" The passage of federal legislation in the 1970s—including the Community Schools Act of 1978—paved the way for state governments to focus legislative efforts on the creation of more community schools, which continued through the 1980s and 1990s. In the mid 1990s, several non-profit parties entered the political arena around full-service schools, including \\"Coalition for Community Schools (CCS), Communities in Schools (CIS), Schools of the 21st Century (an initiative of Yale University), the National Community Education Association (NCEA), and the Children's Aid Society (CAS). These entities worked with agencies and state governments to provide more services at local schools, gain further legislative support around community schools, and convert public schools to community schools. Federal Legislation In addition to the Community Schools Act of 1978, other federal legislation over the past decade has put community schools and collaborative efforts on the forefront of education policies and legislation. The Full-Service Community Schools Act of 2011 will authorize the United States Department of Education grant program to expand the number of full-service community schools across the nation. The bill would fund grants for states to expand the model at the state level and also for local partnerships between school districts and community-based organizations. According to Communities in Schools, The Keeping Parents and Communities Engaged Act (Keeping PACE) amends the ESEA \\"to encourage and support parent, family, and community involvement in schools, to provide needed supports and services to young people, and to ensure that schools are centers of communities.\\" The act also establishes three new grant programs: Schools as Centers of Communities; Connecting Students to Community Resources and Comprehensive Supports; and Parent and Community Outreach and Coordination. The Developing Innovative Partnerships and Learning Opportunities that Motivate Achievement (DIPLOMA) Act merges the Full Service Community Schools Act and the Keeping PACE Act. The Act promotes a shared approach to education by authorizing grants to incentivize partnerships between schools, parents, business leaders, higher education institutions, and community-based organizations. The Working to Encourage Community Action and Responsibility in Education (WeCare) Act amends Title I of ESEA and requires \\"states and local educational agencies (LEAs) to assess the nonacademic factors affecting student academic performance and work with other public, private, non-profit, and community-based entities to address those factors.\\" The 21st Century Community Learning Centers program supports the creation of community learning centers that provides academic enrichment to students—especially students who attend high poverty and low-performing schools—during non-school hours. Time for Innovation Matters in Education (TIME) Act of 2011 authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to LEAs or partnerships between LEAs and other public or nonprofit entities to plan and implement expanding learning time initiatives, especially at high- needs schools. The Supporting Community Schools Act amends the ESEA to allow LEAs to use Title I funds to transform a school identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring into a community school. The Teaching Fellows for Expanded Learning and After-School Act of 2007 awards competitive grants to eligible entities to recruit, select, train, and support 21st century community learning center programs, among others. Community Schools and its Impact on Children in Poverty Students in the United States come to school with different circumstances at home and in their community. In Parsing the Achievement Gap, Barton and Coley identify eight factors before and beyond school that influence the achievement gap, including: frequently changing schools; low birth weight, environmental damage (e.g., exposure to lead or mercury); hunger and nutrition, talking and reading to babies and young children; excessive television watching; parent-pupil ration; and summer achievement gain/loss. Many students will leave school with unequal skills and abilities. Children differ on how ready they are to fully engage in school everyday. These differences are strongly influenced by their social class. Differences in social classes will result in differences in childrearing and children's health. Children in lower-income households: have poorer health; suffer from undiagnosed vision problems; lack adequate dental care; have poor nutrition; are more likely to develop asthma; and are more likely to be born premature or with low birth weights. In order to raise student academic achievement, lower-class children must live in better social and economic conditions. Pedro Noguera agrees that schools cannot be the only vehicle to help eradicate this poverty. > And schools alone - not even the very best schools - cannot erase the > effects of poverty.

Traditional public schools may not have the capacity to address all of the challenges and barriers that face children living in poverty or in low-income households. Through its partnerships, community schools can address a wider range of the issues facing these children and families. The Need for Community Schools Dryfoos and Maguire (2002) propose that children in different communities face significant barriers to learning that schools cannot overcome alone.Dryfoos & Maguire 2002, p. 10. They argue that FSCSs can help overcome many of those barriers in the following ways: * Readiness to learn – Community schools can help improve children's early readiness to learn by incorporating childhood learning centers and parent education classes into the school. * Supportive adults – Community schools can ensure that relationships are established between young people and adults in the community (i.e., health care providers, case managers, additional social workers, and volunteer mentors) by integrating these services with existing pupil personnel services on the campus. * Extended learning opportunities – Community schools can open have schools open for longer hours, which can allow for creative enrichment programs and after-school programs that can integrate activities with classroom curriculum. * Parent involvement – In community schools, parents can participate on planning and advisory boards, can volunteer at schools, and can be hired as teacher's aides and outreach workers. * Lifelong learning – If open during evenings and weekends, community schools can be convenient centers for adults to take credit and noncredit courses to advance their careers or enhance their lives. * Opportunity to perform community service – Community schools can facilitate service learning placements in the community and can ensure that the knowledge gained from the experience is integrated into the classroom instruction. * Access to health care – Community schools can encompass on-site primary health and mental health clinics with trained professionals from community agencies. * Integration of services – Community schools can bring together different services and agencies to one site, with centralized records and common policies. * Safe communities – Community schools can provide a safe place for children early in the morning to late in the evening. * Positive school environment – In order for students and parents to feel more connected to the school, community schools can create service networks to deal with problem behaviors on site. * Changing demographics – Community schools can leverage partnerships to create multicultural environments that celebrates the differences and encourages students' success. * Basic needs – In addition to lunch, community schools can institute breakfast, snack, and dinner programs, to meet the needs of students who are coming to school hungry. Through a family resource center, community schools can also ensure that children have warm clothing, and that parents find adequate housing. * Quality education – Community schools can create a more effective environment through allowing teachers to focus on teaching, since partnerships with community agencies can focus on behavioral and social issues and can plan activities and programs that can be integrated into the school curriculum. Education, Human Capital, and Economic Growth Michael Engle (2000) discusses the development of research around the relationship between education, human capital, and economic growth. He discusses conclusions by other researchers since the 1950s around the high rate of returns on individual investments in education as measured by income. Engle concludes that, \\"Money for schools could be regarded not as consumption spending but as an investment in human resources that will pay off in the future.\\" This conclusion emphasizes the importance of investing in schools, in order to have high rates of returns in regards to income. Additionally, Wilensky and Kline argue that the widely believed notion that public schools are meant to prepare students for jobs and economic productivity is false and risks failure at the outset. They argue that advances in educational attainment \\"cannot compensate for the deterioration in real earnings of young workers that have characterized the American economy since 1973.\\" This results in a large gap between the wealthy and poor. They argue that educators must look beyond the marketplace in defining the mission of public schools and must instead help create schools and communities that contribute to a positive community culture. Other Education Reform Efforts Among the many educational reform efforts, such as charter schools, school vouchers, magnet schools, and alternative schools, the full-service community school model is one of many educational reform efforts that are intended to increase student achievement, but the full-service community school model specifically focuses on the development of the community as a whole. A charter school receives public funds but is not subject to all of the rules, regulations, and statutes public schools must adhere to. A charter school is accountable to what is sent forth in its individual charter. A school voucher is a certificate issued by the government to allow families to apply it the cover the tuition at a private school. A magnet school is a public school with specialized courses and curricula. An alternative school is a school that serves students who are at risk of not achieving academically or are better served by a non- traditional program. \\"Only when schools are part of a larger enterprise committed to raising and educating children as part of the community can they adequately fulfill their role.\\" Full-service community schools act like a 'one-stop-shop' that provides the vital services beyond the school campus to those who are most in need. Academic and Non-Academic Support Of all developed countries, the United States has the most children living in poverty, and the poverty in the U.S. leads to poor performance in schools. Cambell-Allen et al. claim that at the base of the gap between academic achievement and opportunity is the fact that students \\"live and work in an unequal world with unequal services and opportunities which lead to a disparity among incoming students' school readiness\\". Research indicates that children are more likely to be successful in school and later in life if they receive academic and non-academic support. Families of different social classes are more likely to receive different amounts of support. Families living in poverty and middle-class families face differences in regards to childrearing and children's health—including vision, hearing, oral health, lead exposure, asthma, use of alcohol, smoking, birth weight, and nutrition—and have difficulty attaining and fully utilizing government aid. While these differences, may not significantly affect the academic achievement gap between classes on an individual basis, \\"together, they add up to a cumulative disadvantage for lower-class children that can't help but depress average performance. Assessment and Evaluation While there is no clear agreement on how many full-service community schools there are in the country, there are many schools that have instituted relevant pieces of the FSCS model, including extended hours, primary health care centers, or family resource centers.Dryfoos & Maguire 2002, p. 13. The schools cover a broad continuum, from fully realized schools that have existed for at least a decade to schools that are just opening and offering expanded opportunities.Dryfoos & Maguire 2002, p. 131. This makes it difficult to evaluate the progress and performance of all community schools. Additionally, the quality of assessments between schools varies enormously, which also contributes to the difficulty of the evaluation. \\"At best, evaluation is difficult, expensive, and long term.\\" Dryfoos & Maguire (2002) argue that test scores are not the only indicators of success at community schools. :\\"In addition to test scores, indicators of learning and achievement include rates of attendance, promotion, graduation, suspension, and expulsion. It is important to note that many community school models are designed to affect not only education outcomes but also other outcomes that, in turn, are known to affect education outcomes. Such intermediate outcomes include improved social behavior and healthy youth development, better family functioning and increased parental involvement, enhanced school and community climate, and access to support services.\\"Dryfoos & Maguire 2002, p. 130. \\"Research makes it clear that community schools work. In districts across America, community schools are improving student earning, strengthening families and schools, and building communities so that they all function together to contribute to student success.\\" In 2000, Joy G. Dryfoos was able to gather evaluation information from 49 school-community programs. The results were classified into four categories: (1) Learning and achievement outcomes; (2) Behavioral outcomes; (3) Family well-being; and (4) Community life.Dryfoos & Maguire 2002, pp. 132-134. Learning and Achievement Outcomes * Achievement – Over a two- or three-year period, 36 of the 49 programs reported academic gains, particularly in reading and math, and mostly at the elementary level. * Attendance – 19 programs reported improvements in school attendance, and several reported lower drop out rates of students. * Suspensions – 11 programs reported a reduction in suspensions, but this may be due to changes in suspension policies at schools. Behavioral Outcomes * High-Risk Behaviors – 11 programs reported that there was a general improvement in behavior and/or reduction rates regarding substance abuse, teen pregnancy, and disruptive behavior in the classroom. Family Well-Being * Parent Involvement – At least 12 programs reported an increase in parent involvement. * Family Functioning – Improved family functioning was reported for many community school programs with a strong focus on family. Community Life * Access to Services – Each program was reported at least once for having better access to health care, access to dental care, lower hospitalization rates, and higher immunization rates. * Neighborhood – Six programs reported lower violence rates and also safer streets in their communities. Barriers to Creating FSCSs Dryfoos and Maguire (2002) mention some of the implementation barriers that many community schools face, which include:Dryfoos & Maguire 2002, pp. 147-155. * Lack of space – Some schools are new and created at the center of the community, while others involve careful planning and redesign of existing facilities that may require considerable modification over time. * Turf – The responsibility and space of the community schools can feel like it belongs to teachers during the school day and to outside agencies during the extended-day program. * Maintenance – Extending the school hours can create a great deal of pressure on maintenance and custodial staff. * Transportation – Transportation can pose problems because extending the school's hours may not coincide with public transportation schedules, and may thus leave some students with limited options to return home. Cost is a significant consideration when dealing with transportation problems because providing additional busing can be very expensive. * Confidentiality – Sharing difficulties can arise, especially when community schools are trying to integrate two different cultures, such as school and social support. * Discipline – School personnel and community agency personnel have different views about how to deal with discipline issues. Discipline policies will need to be established in the planning stage of the community school. * The Need for Integration – Services that are brought into the school by outside agencies must align with the school's educational system. * Sufficient Funding – Most community schools depend on multiple sources of funding beyond state and federal per-pupil dollars. This funding burden can fall on the principal or the community-based organization, depending on the community school model being employed.

These are the \\"Transplant Period\\" from 1750–1800, when printing and newspapers initially came to Canada as publications of government news and proclamations; followed by the \\"Partisan Period from 1800–1850,\\" when individual printers and editors played a growing role in politics. The \\"Nation Building Period from 1850–1900,\\" when Canadian editors began the work of establishing a common nationalistic view of Canadian society. The \\"Modern period\\" from 1900 to 1980s saw the professionalization of the industry and the growth of chains. \\"Current history\\" since the 1990s saw outside interests take over the chains, as they faced new competition from the Internet. Transplant period 1750-1800 There were no printing presses; in this time, and no newspaper of any kind, under the French regime. All the newspapers in the British colonies had been transplanted from the 13 American colonies. The press in Canada was born as a tool of the government to print official government documents. \\"The discovery of such unrealized potential frightened the powers that be, who commenced a centuries-long period of harassment and intimidation in order to check what today is called the power of the press\\". Information that was hostile to the government was definitely not welcome especially after the end of the American Revolution in 1783. It brought a wave of United Empire Loyalists. Eventually, the Canadian printers began the process of printing more than just government news and proclamations. Many of the early editors and printers were, government or influential, personalities who used their newspapers as instruments of their own political beliefs; and suffered great hardships at the hands of the government because of the oppression they faced. There was little local news printed, and little news from other Canadian places, since there was no system of exchanging newspapers among editors. The first advertising started to appear in the 1780s. The Quebec Gazette of 12 July 1787 had a classified ad: :For sale, a robust Negress, active and with good hearing, about 18 years old, who has had small-pox, has been accustomed to household duties, understands the kitchen, knows how to wash, iron, sew, and very used to caring for children. She can adapt itself equally to an English, French or German family, he speaks all three languages.W.H. Kesterton, A history of journalism in Canada. (McClelland and Stewart, 1967) p 7  Gazettes and American transplants  This was the period that introduced print culture to British North America and began fostering a reading public. All newspapers but The Upper Canada Gazette were started by Americans. In 1783, some 60,000 Loyalists migrated after the American Revolution, with around 30,000 moving to Canada- bringing printing presses with them. All of the first newspapers started life as official government organs. They were all dependent on government patronage and printed solely information condoned by the government. In every province, there was a weekly \\"Gazette\\" (named after The London Gazette, the English governmental organ since 1665) that carried the many notices colonial administrators wanted to circulate. At this time, there was no \\"political sphere\\", as all political news was controlled by the elite. In the early decades of British North America, the primary purpose of the press was to propagate official propaganda - freedom of the press was an alien idea. Prior to the approximate turn of the 18th into the 19th century, there was no \\"public sphere\\" in Canada and therefore no press in the public sphere. First printers and publishers It was the first printers and publishers working during the turn of the century who began the slow and difficult work of creating a true, liberated press in Canada. These men faced many obstacles, including beatings, jailing, and the very serious and oft- carried out threat of being charged with criminal or seditious libel. As the early printing press was an essential tool of colonial administration, anyone who attempted to publish anything other than the government notices experienced hardships. There was a prohibition on publishing legislature proceedings which kept the writers out of the courts. These were colonial laws used by British authorities to manufacture loyalty, and the punishments were severe. As a result, many of these brave early printers and publishers lived in fear, massive debt, and constant persecution. = John Bushell (1715-1761) = Bushell partnered with Bartholomew Green (1690–1751) who died before their plans were realized. Bushell relocated from Boston to Halifax and opened up a printing office, and on March 23, 1752, Bushell published the first edition of the Halifax Gazette and became the colony's first \\"King's Printer\\". He was an independent entrepreneur, given no government salary, and what government administrators thought their subjects needed and what Bushell's subscribers and advertisers wanted were not necessarily the same. He was stuck in between. The government did not trust his loyalty and so made the Provincial Secretary the editor of his paper. Bushell, faced with these obstacles, struggled with debt and alcoholism which eventually led to his death. =Anton Heinrich (1734-1800)= Heinrich learned his trade in Germany but came to America as a fifer in the British Army before relocating to Halifax and anglicizing his name to the more appropriate Henry Anthony. Henry acquired Bushell's enterprise, including the Gazette. In October 1765 he printed an editorial in the Gazette that suggested that Nova Scotians were opposed to the Stamp Act which resulted in doubts about his loyalty, and he fled back to Massachusetts and the Gazette was shut down. Eventually, he made his way back into the government's good graces and was recommissioned to print the Royal Gazette. = William Brown (1737-1789) and Thomas Gilmore (1741-1773) = Originally from Philadelphia, in 1764 the two men launched the government sponsored Quebec Gazette. The paper was bilingual and was heavily censured and scrutinized by the government. =Fleury Mesplet (1734-1794)= Immigrated to Montreal from France with the intent of being a printer. However, he was jailed out of suspicion before printing anything due to his status as an American sympathizer and relationship with Benjamin Franklin. In 1778 he printed Canada's first entirely French newspaper, The Gazette (Montreal). His editor, Valentin Jautard, chose articles with a radical tone and both men were imprisoned. In 1782, Mesplet was released and allowed to go back to work for the government because he was the only capable printer, though he technically remained imprisoned. =Louis Roy (1771-1799)= On April 18, 1793, Roy launched the Upper Canada Gazette, which continued until 1849. In 1797, Roy left the paper due to political persecution after printing some incendiary opinions and fled to New York. Partisan period (1800-1850) This is the period in which the printers and publishers began to see success in their efforts to free the press from its government control. The papers were organs of political parties and editors often played major roles in local politics.The discussion and debate surrounding the \\"public sphere\\" in the North Atlantic was actively undertaken in Upper Canada and partisan newspapers of the 1800s became \\"pure\\" inhabitants of the public sphere. Big steps were taken towards the democratization of the press, and in 1891, the right to report on political proceedings was finally won. The papers of this period were non-deferential, and demanded democratization of information. They undermined finally began to undermine the traditional hierarchical societal structure.James John Talman, \\"The Newspapers of Upper Canada a Century Ago.\\" Canadian Historical Review 19#1 (1938): 9-23. Printers and publishers The development of the public sphere in Canada was closely linked with the development of a free press and there are many parallels. Most of the early publishers were - or became - very active politicians up to the mid-1800s. At this time, there was a growing market for political debate, and the independent printers of this period began using their columns for opinions, to challenge policies, expose government errors, and even promote certain candidates. These men were large personalities, unafraid to strongly voice unpopular opinions. As a result, the newspapers often became a forum for debate between the disagreeing printers. The political issue most often debated was that of responsible government. In responsible government the executive branch is responsible to the elected legislature and no laws can be passed without the approval of said legislature. However, in Upper Canada, the appointed executive remained responsible only to the colonial governor who had to answer to Britain until 1855. Many of the publisher and printer/politicians of this time were debating this key issue. During this period the printers were still working under very difficult conditions. Like the printers before them, many of the printers and publishers were still plagued by debt and had to work tirelessly to earn enough to support their political careers and keep the newspapers running. These men continued the difficult work of liberating the Canadian press and it is in the stories of these men that we start to see some success along with the difficulty. Le Canadien, November 22, 1806, vol. 1, no 1. =Le Canadien= \\"Le Canadien\\" was a French weekly newspaper published in Lower Canada from November 22, 1806 to March 14, 1810. Its motto was: \\"Nos institutions, notre langue et nos droits\\" (Our institutions, our language, our rights). It was the political mouthpiece of the Parti canadien, the voice of the liberal elite and merchants. It repeatedly editorialized for responsible government, and spoke out in a defense of the Canadiens and their traditions against the British rulers, while professing loyalty to the king. In 1810 Governor James Craig had the editor Pierre Bédard and his colleagues at the paper arrested and imprisoned without trial for the criticism they published. The paper was reestablished in the 1830s under Étienne Parent, who was imprisoned for advocating responsible government in 1839. During the rebellion era, it criticized the Durham report, opposed the union with Upper Canada, and supported the Lafontaine ministry. It was a mainstay of Liberalism until it closed at the end of the century.Louis-Georges Harvey, \\"Canadien, Le,\\" Oxford Companion to Canadian History (2006) p 111 =Gideon and Sylvester Tiffany= These brothers started as official government printers in the 1790s, but refused to print only government sanctioned news and instead printed news from America. When they refused to heed warnings from the government, they were more formally persecuted. In April 1797, Gideon was charged with blasphemy, fired, fined, and jailed. Sylvester was then also charged with \\"treasonable and seditious conduct\\". In his defense he declared that \\"As the people's printer, it is my duty to devote my head, heart and hands to their service...The interests of the King and people are inseparable\\". Eventually the brothers were forced to give up printing, through Sylvester attempted a number of other papers before moving to New York. =Titus Geer Simons= Simmons was appointed as the new King's printer following the legal persecution of the Tiffany brothers, though he was not officially trained in printing. The Tiffany brothers remained on, and continued to determine much of the paper's content until 1799. =William Lyon Mackenzie= Mackenzie was a great influence for political development in Upper Canada (Ontario) and a fierce advocate for responsible government. In 1824, he founded the Colonial Advocate, which was the first independent paper in the province to have significant political impact. Mackenzie viewed the colonial administration as incompetent, ineffective, and expensive, and he used the Advocate to publicize these opinions. Though the paper became the most widely circulated paper, it was not profitable for Mackenzie and he struggled with debt for many years. In 1826 his printing office was broken into and destroyed by a mob. When MacKenzie sued the assailants, he won his case and collected enough in damages to repair the press and pay off his debts, as well as gain public sympathy. Mackenzie is a prime example of an editor who used his printing as a tool to take on the troubled politics of the time and open the door for the newspaper to enter the public sphere.David Flint, William Lyon Mackenzie, Rebel Against Authority (Oxford University Press, 1971) =Joseph Howe= Howe's slogan displayed on the ChronicleHerald building in downtown Halifax. In 1828, Joseph Howe took over Halifax's Weekly Chronicle, renaming it the Acadian. He then also purchased the Novascotian. His aggressive journalism made him the voice of Nova Scotia. Originally he was very loyal to the British government, But his growing trust ration shifted his loyalties to Nova Scotia. Howe, like MacKenzie, demanded home rule in the name of \\"responsible government\\".Lorna Inness, \\"Joseph Howe: Journalist.,\\" Nova Scotia Historical Quarterly (1973) 3#3 pp 159-170. In 1835, Howe was prosecuted for criminal libel for one of his articles. He spoke in argument for a free press at his trial and though he was technically guilty according to the law, the jury was quick to acquit. His success during his trial made him a local hero in Nova Scotia. It was this success that took Howe into the provincial parliament, and he eventually became a provincial premier.J. Murray Beck, Joseph Howe: Conservative Reformer 1804–1848 (v.1 (1982) =Henry David Winton (1793-1855)= Winton arrived in Newfoundland on August 28, 1818. In 1820, he founded the Public Ledger and Newfoundland General Advisor, the fourth newspaper in St. John's. Winton used the paper to publish his own political ideas staunchly in support of responsible government. Because of his strong political sentiments he eventually became the enemy of Catholics as well as those in favor of reform - to the extent that some people wished him harm. On May 19, 1835, Winton was attacked by a group of unknown assailants and his ears were cut off. Despite this and further similar threats, Winton continued to write in opposition of the reform government until his death. =John Ryan (1761-1847) and William Lewis= Ryan was an American expatriate who, in 1807 and with the help of William Lewis, published the first issue of the Royal St. John's Gazette, the earliest newspaper in Newfoundland. Ryan soon began exposing government favoritism and unfairness in the Gazette, much to the chagrin of officials. In March 1784, both men were indicted for libel. =Joseph Willcocks (1773-1814)= In 1806, Willcocks moved to Niagara where he began publishing the Upper Canada Guardian; or Freeman's Journal which he used as a vehicle for his political opinions and criticisms. That same year, he was jailed for contempt of the house. in 1808, he rejoined politics officially and became Canada's first true leader of the Opposition against those aligned with the colonial government. He stopped printing his journal in 1812. In July 1813, he offered his services to the Americans while holding a seat in the Legislative Assembly and was formally charged with treason in 1814.  Nation-building and myth-making period (1850-1900)  The Montreal Evening Star in 1869 Editors were now free from direct governmental control. However, the government continued to influence them in other underhanded ways, such as privately persuading editorial content and putting paid advertising only into assenting newspapers. For the most part, the radical newspapers of the Public Sphere Period had served their purposes and the papers of this period were somewhat more unbiased. More than ever, technology and progress were of great importance. The papers of this time took on the role of establishing the Canadian identity. In publications of this period, there was a celebration of conformity and orthodoxy. Unlike the incendiary publications of the past, there was no justification seen for the rejection of order. Printers and publishers During this period, largely free from the government restrictions of the past, that the printers and publishers took on the role of establishing the Canadian identity. As before, many of them were personally involved in politics as well and continued to use their papers to exert their political sentiments and to push for progress and change. =George Brown (1818-1880)= George Brown (1818–1880) and his father immigrated to Toronto from Scotland in 1837; in 1843 they founded the \\"Banner,\\" a Presbyterian weekly supporting Free Kirk principles and political reform. In 1844, Brown founded The Globe and Mail, a paper with strong political ambitions. Brown bought out many competitors and increased circulation using advanced technology. By 1860 it was Canada's largest newspaper. In the 1850s, Brown entered politics and became the Reform Party leader and eventually reached an agreement that led to the Confederation and the founding of the Dominion of Canada. Afterwards, he resigned from Parliament, but continued to promote his political views in the \\"Globe\\". Brown fought endless battles with the typographical union from 1843 to 1872. He paid union wages not because of generosity but only when the power of the union forced it upon him. In 1880 he was killed by an angry ex-employee.Sally Zerker, \\"George Brown and the Printers Union,\\" Journal of Canadian Studies (1975) 10#1 pp 42-48. =Modeste Demers (1809-1871)= In Victoria in 1856, Bishop Modeste Demers imported a hand press intending to publish religious materials. It remained unused until 1858, when the American printer Frederick Marriott used the \\"Demers press\\" to publish four different British Columbia newspapers, the most influential of which was the British Colonist. The Demers press continued to be used for printing until 1908. =Amor De Cosmos (1825-1897)= Amor De Cosmos was the founder of the \\"British Colonist\\". He was well known for using its pages to express his political opinions. De Cosmos also eventually entered politics, assumed leadership, urged political reform and pushed for \\"responsible government. He was elected to represent Victoria in the House of Commons while at the same time serving as the provincial premiere of British Columbia. He was outspoken and eccentric, and made quite a few enemies throughout his life. He was accused of a scandal with the unions which eventually forced him to leave politics. When he died he had fallen into a complete breakdown. Modern period from 1900 to 1980s Changing economics Starting in the 1870s, new aggressive publishers included Hugh Graham at the Montreal Star, and John Ross Robertson at the Toronto Telegram, the voice of working-class Orange Protestantism. They adapted the model of the American penny press and sold cheap newspapers with a strong partisan slant and an emphasis on local news of crime, scandal, and corruption. Entertainment news became increasingly prominent, especially the comings and goings of celebrities. Sports gained increasing attention as the readers followed the ups and downs of their local teams. New features were added to attract women, including articles on fashions, grooming, and recipes. The new technology made printing cheaper and faster, and encouraged multiple editions that provided updated news throughout the day in the major cities. The Montreal Star by 1899, sold 52,600 copies a day, and by 1913 40% of its circulation was outside of Montreal. It dominated the English-language market. In 1900, most Canadian newspapers were local affairs, designed primarily to inform local partisans about the provincial and national political scene. The publishers depended on loyal partisan subscribers, as well as contracts for public printing controlled by the political parties. Objectivity was not the goal, as the editors and reporters endeavored to reinforce the partisan attitudes on major public questions.Paul Rutherford, A Victorian authority: the daily press in late nineteenth-century Canada (1982) In the 1910s, the newspaper industry consolidated as dailies closed, chains formed, and rivals cooperated through press associations and news services. A key factor was advertising--the larger the audience the better, but partisanship reduced potential circulation to members of only one party. In the 19th century advertisers used papers that shared their political leanings. But now national advertising agencies adopted new media buying practices. They became nonpartisan and favoured papers with the highest circulation. The companies placing ads wanted to reach the maximum possible audience regardless of partisanship. The result was a series of consolidations yielding much larger, largely nonpartisan newspapers, which depended more heavily on advertising revenue than on subscriptions from loyal party members. By 1900, three-fourths of the revenue of Toronto newspapers came from advertising. About two thirds of the newspapers' editorial pages loyally supported either the Conservative or the Liberal party, while the remainder were more independent. Regardless of the editorial page, the news pages increasingly prioritized objectivity and bipartisanship. The publishers were focused on advertising revenues that were proportionate to overall circulation. A newspaper that appealed only to one party cut its potential audience in half. Simultaneously, the rapid growth of industry in Ontario and Quebec, coupled with the rapid settlement of the prairies, produced a large more affluent newspaper-reading population. The result was a golden age for Canadian newspapers peaking about 1911. Many papers failed during the war era. Advertising agencies in 1915 gained a major advantage with the arrival of the Audit Bureau of Circulations, which for the first-time provided reliable data on circulation, as opposed to the partisan boasting and exaggeration that had been the norm. the agencies now had a stronger hand in bargaining for lower advertising rates. The 1920s became a time of consolidation, budget-cutting and dropping of traditional party affiliation. By 1930 only 24% of Canada's dailies were partisan, 17% were \\"independent\\" partisan, and the majority, 50%, had become fully independent.Russell Johnston, \\"Partisan Politics, Market Research, and Media Buying in Canada, 1920,\\" Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly (2006) 83#4 Major papers =Globe and Mail= In 1936, the two main papers in Toronto merged: The Globe (circulation 78,000) absorbed The Mail and Empire (circulation 118,000). The latter formed through the 1895 merger of two conservative newspapers, The Toronto Mail and Toronto Empire. The Empire was founded in 1887 by Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald. Globe and Mail staff await news of the D-Day invasion. June 6, 1944. Although the new Globe and Mail lost ground to The Toronto Star in the local Toronto market, it began to expand its national circulation. The newspaper was unionised in 1955, under the banner of the American Newspaper Guild.unifor87m.org: \\"OUR HISTORY\\" In 1980, the Globe and Mail was acquired by The Thomson Corporation, a company run by the family of Kenneth Thomson. Few changes were made in editorial or news policy. However, there was more attention paid to national and international news on the editorial, op-ed, and front pages in contrast to its previous policy of stressing Toronto and Ontario material. Chains Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet Thomson acquired his first newspaper in 1934 with a down payment of $200 when he purchased the local daily in Timmins, Ontario. He began an expansion of both radio stations and newspapers in various Ontario locations in partnership with fellow Canadian, Jack Kent Cooke. By the early 1950s, he owned 19 newspapers and was president of the Canadian Daily Newspaper Publishers Association.Russell Braddon, Roy Thomson of Fleet Street (London: Collins, 1965) One by one, major dailies either closed down or were bought out by nationwide chains, such as those operated by Postmedia Network (formerly Southam) or Thomson Corporation, an international conglomerate. The Government made studies but they had no impact on the trend. In 1970 the Special Senate Committee on the Mass Media, or the Davey Committee warned against consolidation. Its recommendations were ignored, and consolidation continued. Likewise the Kent Commission of 1981 was another Royal commission on newspapers whose recommendations were also ignored. Current history since the 1990s In this era outside interests took over the chains and they became parts of large conglomerates. By 2004, the five largest chains controlled 72 percent of the papers, and 79 percent of the circulation.W. Soderlund and K. ildebrandt, Canadian Newspaper Ownership in the Era of Convergence (University of Alberta Press, 2005). New competition from the Internet became a major threat to the news and advertising roles. The decline in newspaper advertising revenue was worldwide, and caused by the shift from paper media and television into Internet advertising in Canada, newspaper advertising revenue fell from a high of $2.6 billion Steadily down to $1.9 billion in 2011, with no end in sight. Circulation fell steadily as well. The newspaper chains reduced production costs cut the number of pages, and dropped traditional features, such as detailed stock market reports. They set up paywalls in order to charge for Internet access.Chris Powell, \\"Cutting costs, building walls.\\" Marketing (Nov 19, 2012) Supplement, p 11.Gaëtan Tremblay, \\"iPublish or perish: challenges facing the Québec press in the digital age,\\" Media, Culture & Society (Jan 2015) 37#1 pp 144-151. A 2019 Report conducted by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism; found out that only 9% of Canadian pays for any proportion online news in 2019. The National Post Conrad Black launched his national newspaper chain Hollinger International in the 1990s by purchasing the Southam Newspapers, that included the Ottawa Citizen, Montreal Gazette, Edmonton Journal, Calgary Herald, and Vancouver Sun. For a brief time Hollinger owned almost 60 per cent of Canada's daily newspapers. Black transformed a Toronto business paper into the National Post as his flagship title. The editorial tone was conservative. Black spent massively in the first few years under editor Ken Whyte in a furious battle with the Globe and Mail. Maclean's says \\"The National Post not only shook up Canada's media establishment, it expanded the country's political conversation, providing a diversity of opinion on a wide range of public issues. The Post has given readers 10 years of insight, humour, and most of all, choice in the market for daily news.\\"\\"Seven Days,\\" Maclean's, (Nov 10, 2008) Black sold the National Post to CanWest Global in 2000–01. By 2006 the National Post cut back sharply on its national distribution system in an effort to cut costs and stay alive. By 2008 Globe and Mail and National Post had a combined circulation nationwide of 3.4 million.Marketing Magazine (Sept. 15, 2008) Supplement, p 4 CanWest The emblematic network was CanWest until it collapsed in 2009. It was founded by a Manitoba tax lawyer, journalist, and politician Izzy Asper (1932-2003), who started with a local TV station in 1975 and built the nation's largest publisher of newspapers, with The National Post as its flagship. CanWest bought out the Southam chain. It owned the Global network and E! television, as well as the Alliance Atlantis group of specialty channels. At its peak in the early 21st century it owned the Canada.com Internet portal, and had television and radio interests in Australia and Turkey.Marc Edge, Asper Nation: Canada's Most Dangerous Media Company (Vancouver: New Star Books 2007) CanWest went bankrupt in 2009, and the newspapers were taken over by Postmedia Network, while the broadcasting assets were sold separately to Shaw Communications. Quebec newspapers Quebec has always been a largely separate newspaper world. Montreal has one daily in English (The Gazette) and two in French (Le Devoir and Le Journal de Montréal). La Presse, which was Montreal's major newspaper, became 100% digital in 2018. In Québec City, there are two daily newspapers, Le Soleil and Le Journal de Québec. Outside Quebec's main cities, The Record (Sherbrooke) is English-language; five publish in French: Le Droit (Gatineau/Ottawa); Le Nouvelliste (Trois-Rivières), Le Quotidien (Saguenay), La Tribune (Sherbrooke) and La Voix de l'Est (Granby). Consolidation has meant that all but one of the French-language newspapers belong to one of two media consortia. Gesca is part of Power Corporation of Canada and controlled by the Desmarais family). The other, Quebecor Media controls most of the Quebec's television and magazine market. For a few years it was the largest chain in Canada, with 36 English language papers. Quebecor Media is a large conglomerate controlled by Pierre Karl Péladeau, who owns the controlling shares in Quebecor, that includes many community newspapers, magazines, free newspapers, and Internet services chiefly in French. It is cutting back on newspapers to concentrate on its broadcasting, cable and wireless properties. In 2013 it sold off 74 Quebec weeklies to Transcontinental Inc. for $75 million. In late 2014, Quebecor sold its 175 Sun Media English language newspapers, and many websites, to the Canadian group Postmedia Network for $316 million. Postmedia now owns all the dailies in Edmonton, Calgary and Ottawa.Martin Patriquin, \\"Newspaper kershuffle,.\\" Maclean's (Oct 20, 2014) Gesca since 2013 has responded to the Internet challenge by expanding its free on-line services, which it supports through advertising.Gaëtan Tremblay, \\"iPublish or perish: challenges facing the Québec press in the digital age,\\" Media, Culture & Society (Jan 2015) 37#1 pp 144-151.

It was Obama's third State of the Union Address and his fourth speech to a joint session of the United States Congress. Presiding over this joint session was the House Speaker, John Boehner, accompanied by Joe Biden, the Vice President of the United States. In his speech, he focused on education reform, repairing America's infrastructure with money not used on the Iraq War, and creating new energy sources in America. Seating and guests In keeping up the tradition that began with the 2011 State of the Union Address, the members of Congress sat with members of the other political party, rather than sitting on separate sides of the room. Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was the victim of an assassination attempt the previous year, was in attendance, as she planned to resign to focus on her rehabilitation from the shooting.

The designated survivor for the 2012 State of the Union Address was United States Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack. Summary During his state of the Union Address President Obama mentioned the completed US withdrawal from Iraq, the return of some US troops from Afghanistan and the accomplishments against the Taliban and al-Qaeda including the deaths of Osama bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki. Obama underscored Americas commitment to Israel, Americas determination to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and explained during his Arab Spring section the US position regarding the uprising in Syria by saying: “while it is ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well. We will stand against violence and intimidation. We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings – men and women; Christians, Muslims, and Jews. We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty.” The president discussed the economic situation in America before and after his Inauguration and said with respect to the Income inequality in the United States and the 2012 presidential election: “We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by. Or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.” Obama reiterated his call for Congress to extend the payroll tax cut through the end of the year, a benefit to working-class families, urged Congress in his speech to make college more affordable and warned colleges and universities that they risk losing federal funding if they do not keep tuition costs down. The President called upon Congress to deny tax breaks to companies that outsource and provide a tax credit to companies that bring jobs back into the United States. He also called for better job training and education and proposed to use one half of the savings from the completed Iraq War and the winding down Afghanistan War for public-works projects and the other half for deficit reduction. Obama pushed Congress to make it easier for Americans to refinance their homes if their interest rates are above market rates, by using revenue from the administration's proposed fee on banks to help finance the initiative. During the speech, Obama announced the creation of a Unit on Mortgage Origination and Securitization Abuses, which will operate as part of the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, to investigate misconduct that contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis. The unit will be headed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The president also proposed a new trade enforcement unit that would add to the number of government investigators pursuing unfair trade practices and that would be responsible for filing lawsuits against foreign countries, namely China. Obama also renewed his call for the institution of the Buffett Rule, whereby people making more than $1 million a year would pay a minimum effective tax rate of at least 30 percent in income taxes, and to let the high-end Bush-era tax cuts expire. With respect to the Buffet Rule The New York Times reported: \\"Mr. Obama would like the new tax to replace the alternative minimum tax, which was created decades ago to make sure that the richest taxpayers with plentiful deductions and credits did not avoid income taxes, but which now affects millions of Americans who are considered upper middle class.\\" With respect to Obama's energy policy the NYT wrote that the President will seek an \\"expansion of domestic energy supplies, both from traditional fuels like oil and natural gas and from cleaner sources like wind and the sun. He singled out the rapid growth of domestic natural gas production through the technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.\\", while the Washington Post wrote that Obama would open up new federal land to develop wind farms and solar energy plants to reduce the nation's reliance on foreign oil.

HFO-1234ze(E) has zero ozone-depletion potential (ODP=0), a very low global-warming potential (GWP < 1 ), even lower than CO, and it is classified by ANSI/ASHRAEANSI/ASHRAE Standard 34, 2010.

Given the relatively high global warming potential (GWP) of most of the hydro-fluoro-carbons (HFCs), several actions are ongoing in different countries to reduce the use of these fluids. For example, the European Union’s recent F-Gas regulation (Regulation [EC] No 517/2014) specifies the mandatory GWP values of the refrigerants to be used as working fluids in almost all air conditioners and refrigeration machines beginning in 2020.Giulia Righetti, Claudio Zilio, Simone Mancin & Giovanni A. Longo (2016): A review on in-tube two-phase heat transfer of hydro-fluoro-olefines refrigerants, Science and Technology for the Built Environment, DOI:10.1080/23744731.2016.1229528 Several types of possible replacement candidates have been proposed so far, both synthetic and natural. Among the synthetic options, hydro-fluoro-olefins (HFOs) are the ones appearing most promising thus far. HFO-1234ze(E) has been adopted as working fluid in chillers, heat pumps, and supermarket refrigeration systems. It has been demonstrated that HFO-1234ze(E) can not be considered as a drop-in replacement of HFC-134a. In fact, from a thermodynamic point-of-view, it can be stated that: – The theoretical coefficients of performance of HFO-1234ze(E) is slightly lower than HFC-134a one; – HFO-1234ze(E) has a different volumetric cooling capacity when compared to HFC-134a. – HFO-1234ze(E) has saturation pressure drops higher than HFC-134a during two-phase heat transfer under the constraint of achieving the same heat transfer coefficient.Brown, J.S., C. Zilio, R. Brignoli, and A. Cavallini. 2013. Heat transfer and pressure drop penalization terms (exergy losses) during flow boiling of refrigerants. International Journal of Energy Research 37:1669–79. So, from a technological point-of-view, modifications to the condenser and evaporator designs and to compressor displacement are needed to achieve the same cooling capacity and energetic performance of HFC-134a.

Aspects of the reports made immediately after her injury and death apparently supported the conclusion that her death was due to spontaneous human combustion; John Heymer devoted a chapter of his 1996 book The Entrancing Flame to the case. However, later research has cast doubt on some of the evidence and refutes the claims that her injuries were caused by spontaneous human combustion Death Jeannie Saffin was born in Edmonton, LondonEngland & Wales, Birth Index: 1916-2005 with birth defects that led to mental handicaps which reduced her abilities to those of a child. She was 61 years old at the time of her death. On the evening of 15 September 1982, she was at the family's home in Edmonton with her father, Jack Saffin, and her brother-in-law, Don Carroll. Jeannie was sitting with her father in the kitchen. Jack Saffin was looking away from Jeannie when his attention was drawn to his daughter as she was suddenly on fire. Jack Saffin and his son-in- law Don Carroll put out the fire using water from the kitchen, and then called for an ambulance. Jeannie was treated en route to the hospital by paramedics, admitted to North Middlesex Hospital, and then transferred to the burn unit at Mount Vernon Hospital, where she was treated until her death caused by \\"broncho-pneumonia due to burns\\" eight days after the original fire and injury. Relatives suggested at the inquest that the death could have been a case of spontaneous human combustion, but the coroner, Dr John Burton, said there was \\"no such thing\\" and gave an open verdict. Spontaneous human combustion Saffin's case has been held as an example of spontaneous human combustion by paranormal researchers and authors. Jack Saffin's son-in-law, Don Carroll, who was in the home at the time of the fire, has stated that Jeannie had flames coming from her mouth, and made roaring noises like a dragon. Both Carroll and Jack Saffin have repeatedly claimed that prior to Jeannie being lit aflame there was no source of ignition in the kitchen except the pilot light on the gas stove. Carroll also states that Jeannie's clothes were unburned and that there was no smoke damage in the kitchen. The interpretation of Heymer and Arnold's works have led to Saffi'’s case as being quoted as proof of spontaneous human combustion by researchers and authors anxious to make the case for spontaneous human combustion. An alternate view debunks the evidence pointing towards Saffin being an example of spontaneous human combustion. Proponents of the combustion theory have stated that Saffin \\"came to be burned inside unburned clothes,\\"Heymer, The Entrancing Flame, p. 187. However, later research noted by Joe Nickell suggests that Saffin's clothes were burned. In a written statement given at the time of Saffin's death, 12 years before the interview conducted by Heymer, Carroll stated that Saffin's clothes were severely burned. Also, police reports indicated that upon their arrival, constables witnessed Jeannie's clothing burning and removed it after putting out the flames. The source of the flames has also been scrutinized by skeptics. Carroll has stated that the flames came from Saffin's mouth; however, the medical evidence does not support this conclusion: Saffin's mouth was undamaged, according to hospital records. Medical records also support the conclusion that the majority of Saffin's burns were the result of contact with burning or melted nylon from her clothing. The burning and melting patterns of her nylon clothing could make it appear that the fire was coming from inside Saffin's body. Opponents of the spontaneous human combustion theory also have a potential explanation for the source of the flame that ignited Saffin's clothing, causing the fire. Carroll made several statements that the only source of flame in the kitchen was the pilot light for the stove. In one interview he specifically noted that Jack Saffin's pipe was unlit and filled with fresh tobacco. Nickell outlines a plausible explanation, that Jack Saffin knocked out used tobacco from his pipe in order to refill it, and that while doing so, caused lit embers of pipe tobacco to land on Jeannie's clothing. Nickell suggests this is even more likely, because at the time of the fire, the kitchen window and door were open, causing a cross breeze. Pipe embers, carried by the breeze and then landing on Saffin's flammable nylon clothing, would easily catch fire and cause the severe burns found on Saffin's body at autopsy.

In all, there were six different products in the line, nearly all of which were actually licensed by Tandy rather than being original Tandy games. The games looked to capitalize on the popularity of the video game Space Invaders which was released in 1978.  History  Fire Away was the first Tandy game to hold the name. Released in 1981, Tandy licensed the game from the Japanese company Gakken who created and sold the game under the name Invader. The game was also licensed to Computer Games Limited (CGL) as Galaxy Invader and by Vanity Fair as Electron Blaster. The game, regardless of the company, was essentially the same. A joystick was used by the player's left hand to move the gun base to the left and right. A large red button used by the player's right hand fired the missiles. There were three settings, 1, 2, and 3, which adjusted the game speed, with '3' being the fastest. There were seven tiers on the plastic screen which covered the VFD display. The bottom tier, labeled \\"G\\", was where the base moved. The two tiers above this had no label while the remaining tiers were marked 1, 2, 3, and 10. The numbers referred to the points earned when the player eliminated the invader. The 10 point tier was populated by a UFO that appeared every 15 shots, moving across the top. The invaders themselves would populate within the remaining point earning tiers, two at a time. They would drop bombs and move down towards the player's base. If the invader reached the \\"G\\" tier, the game ended (although a glitch meant that holding down the fire button 'immunized' the player against an alien that reached the \\"G\\" tier. After a few seconds, the alien vanished and the player could continue). Three hits on the base by bombs would end the game. Once the player reached 199 points, the game ended in victory for the player. Both the Tandy and Vanity Fair versions of the game used a blue housing while the Gakken and CGL games used a white housing. The game used four AA batteries and the LED made the invaders, etc. appear blue. The original retail price was $39.95. The following year, in 1982, Tandy introduced the next Fire Away under the title Cosmic 1000 Fire Away. Like the first game, Tandy licensed it from Gakken who sold the game as Galaxy Invader 1000 while CGL also licensed the game, selling it under the same name as Gakken. The principle of the new game remained the same but with improvements in the case design and adding some changes to the game play. Another tier was added for a total of eight. The missile station was on the tier marked \\"M\\" with the Ground (\\"G\\") being the next tier up. The remaining tiers were again points earned, starting at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10. These tiers were marked as the \\"Invader Zone\\" while the top tier was the \\"UFO Zone\\". The player now had to obtain 999 points and had a finite number of missiles to launch at the invaders (250 missiles). The player earned a bonus missile station and 50 more missiles if he or she reached 700 points. When the missile count got low, the game made a warning sound. The game ended when 999 points was reached, or all missile station were destroyed, or the invader reached the \\"G\\" tier, or the player ran out of missiles. The UFO flew in random patterns, to cause the player to expend missiles through misses. Four AA batteries provided power with the LED colored so that the missile station, the invaders, their bombs, and the score were blue while the player's missiles, the UFO, and hits on the missile station and invaders appeared red. The retail price increased to $59.95. In 1983, Tandy introduced the Cosmic 2000 Fire Away and it was a departure from the design of the previous two games. This may have been due to Tandy licensing the game from a different company, in this case, Hanzawa, rather than through Gakken. Actronics also licensed the game from Hanzawa, marketing it under the name Twinvader III. The case was shaped to resemble an arcade game and the joystick was replaced with left and right buttons. The order of the main controls were also reversed with the fire button being on the left and the missile station (called a fortress in this version) movement controls on the right. As the name suggests, the player had to score 2,000 points in order to win. The score counter, however, had only three places so when the player reached the first 999 points, it would then reset to 000 and continue until the next 999 was reached, ending the game upon the next point. Like the previous two games, there were three modes of difficulty. A new invader was added in which, upon being hit, would split into two. Waves were introduced, called convoys, which were composed of 10 invaders. 5 invaders could be on the playing field at one time. There was a demo mode which would run the game on its own and also a mute button. Tandy's version used a blue case while Actronics used a brown case. The player gained victory after destroying 15 convoys (150 invaders) or earns 2,000 points and the player lost if all fortresses are destroyed or one of the invaders lands. Every 1,000 points earned the player a bonus fortress. The game used four C batteries or could be played using an AC adapter. Retail price was $39.95. 1984 saw the introduction of the Tandy Cosmic 3000 Fire Away game. Like the first two games, this was a licensed product from Gakken and thus it used the same basic styling as its fore bearers. Gakken marketed their game as Galaxy Invader 2000. The tiers were reduced to six and included the missile station, a \\"barrier\\", and four invader zones. The points were also changed so that, tier depending, the player could earn 100, 200, or 300 points depending on where he or she hit the invader. Gone was the UFO. The player could only have 1 missile in flight on the board at one time but there were barriers which were destroyed when hit by invader bombs (much like Space Invaders) and these barriers would renew once a wave of invaders was destroyed. Unlike Space Invaders, the player's missiles did not destroy the barrier. There were only two difficulty modes rather than three. To win, the player needed to achieve 10,000 points (which the game could display). The player lost when all three missile stations were destroyed. Unlike the previous games, the player did not lose when the invader reached the bottom of the screen. Akin to the popular arcade game Galaga, the invader would reappear at the top of the game screen and continue to attack. The game required four C batteries but could also use an AC adapter. Retail price was $39.95. Tandy let the line languish for several years when, in 1989, they introduced LCD Fire Away. The big change was the replacement of the LED for a LCD. The game was also smaller and used a similar control layout as Cosmic 2000 Fire Away did. It also had a much lower price point, retailing for $12.95. Due to the reduced power needs, LCD Fire Away was able to use watch batteries rather than AA or C batteries. Tandy/Radio Shack would repackage the same game as Invasion Force and later, in 1990, as Jet Fighter. LCD Fire Away and its derivatives would be the last of the line. Other Tandy Fire Away games In 1981, Bandai marketed a game called Flight Time (in France, the game box read Pilote de Chasse though the game itself still said Flight Time) which Tandy licensed as Fire Away. While carrying the same name, the original Bandai game used aircraft rather than alien invaders which set it apart from the Fire Away line. This game was only sold in the UK. One of the 12 games in the Tandy-12 Computerized Arcade system is named Fire Away In 1983, Tandy licensed Nelsonic's 1981 watch game Space Attacker under the name Cosmic Fire Away Game Watch. Tandy retailed it for $29.95. The same game was sold by Collins Industrial as the Star Trek II:Wrath of Khan Video Game Watch while Majestron released the watch as Cosmic Wars.

During Tang Dynasty  It is not known when Wang Zhaozuo was born. His family had controlled Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei, the later basis for the Zhao state) for generations, by the time of his birth. As of 900, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang, when Wang Zhaozuo's father Wang Rong was serving as Chengde's military governor (Jiedushi), Wang Zhaozuo was serving as the deputy military governor, the traditional position for the military governor's successor. That year, Chengde came under the attack of the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), Wang Rong sued for peace by offering a large tribute of colored silk to Zhu, and also offered Wang Zhaozuo and the sons or brothers of key Chengde officers as hostages to show his intent to submit to Zhu. Zhu accepted the tribute and the hostages, and after taking Wang Zhaozuo back to his capital Bian Prefecture (), gave one of his daughters to Wang Zhaozuo in marriage.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262.  After Tang Dynasty  For years after that, there were no historical references made to Wang Zhaozuo himself. In 907, when Zhu Quanzhong forced Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor Emperor Ai to yield the throne to him, ending Tang Dynasty and starting a new Later Liang with him as its Emperor Taizu,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. Wang Zhaozuo's wife would have been created as Princess Puning.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. Meanwhile, the new Later Liang emperor also created Wang Rong the Prince of Zhao.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 39. (By this point, Chengde Circuit had been renamed Wushun, to observe naming taboo, as Emperor Taizu's father was named Zhu Cheng (朱誠 — not the same character as \\"Cheng\\" () in Chengde, but a homophone.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. At some point, Wang Zhaozuo and Princess Puning must have returned to Wushun, as, while no historical references were made to him, historical references were made to her presence in 910. That year, Emperor Taizu, suspicious of whether Wang Rong and Wang Chuzhi the military governor of neighboring Yiwu Circuit (義武, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), who had submitted to him but remained in de facto control of their circuits, would remain permanently submissive to him, decided to try to seize control of both circuits by force. He thus had his attendants Du Tingyin () and Ding Yanhui () seize Wushun's Shen () and Ji (冀州, both in modern Hengshui, Hebei) Prefectures by trick and commissioned the major general Wang Jingren to prepare a full attack on the two circuits to seize them. When Wang Rong was unable to retake Shen and Ji himself, he and Wang Chuzhi sought aid from Li Cunxu, the prince of Later Liang's archenemy Jin. When Li Cunxu, against the advice of some of his generals, decided to aid Wang Rong, he dismissed Princess Puning's presence there (which the generals opposing the action cited as possibly showing that Wang Rong was intending trickery on Later Liang's behalf) as inconsequential. After Li Cunxu successfully helped Wang Rong in repelling Wang Jingren, Wang Rong's domain effectively became an independent Zhao state, and the Wushun name was changed back to Chengde.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. In 920, Wang Rong, who had become accustomed to luxurious living, alienated his army by spending too much time at his vacation home in the mountains west of Zhao's capital Zhen Prefecture (). The soldiers mutinied and killed Wang Rong's favorite eunuch Shi Ximeng (), and in response, Wang Rong killed the eunuch Li Honggui () and the officer Li Ai (), whom he blamed for inciting the mutiny, and slaughtered Li Honggui's and Li Ai's families. He transferred Li Honggui's and Li Ai's authorities to Wang Zhaozuo (who was then still serving as deputy military governor) and Wang Zhaozuo's adoptive brother Wang Deming. Wang Rong continued to pursue those whom he considered to be Li Honggui's and Li Ai's associates, and many were killed. Wang Deming, who by this point had formed the ambition to overthrow his adoptive father, falsely informed the guards that Wang Rong was intending to slaughter them all, causing a general panic in the guard corps. In spring 921, the guards mutinied and killed Wang Rong. They offered the leadership of the circuit to Wang Deming. Wang Deming accepted, and changed his name back to Zhang Wenli. He captured Wang Zhaozuo the next day, and had Wang Zhaozuo decapitated in front of the army camp.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 54. He then slaughtered Wang Rong's clan, sparing only Princess Puning, hoping that this would open the possibility of Later Liang assistance, as Later Liang was then ruled by Emperor Taizu's son and Princess Puning's brother Zhu Zhen. (However, the Later Liang assistance would never come, and, after Zhang Wenli himself died shortly after, Li Cunxu was able to defeat and execute Zhang Wenli's son and successor Zhang Chujin, absorbing the Zhao lands into Jin.)

The unit is believed to have become part of JSOC due to its extensive training and unique capabilities to conduct special reconnaissance and close target reconnaissance (CTR) operations, and advanced force operations (AFO). It is often referred as a Special Mission Unit (SMU). Disposition Based out of Fort Benning, Georgia, RRC is among the premier special reconnaissance units of the U.S. military. RRD, as it was originally called, was activated in October 1984 with the formation of the 75th Ranger Regiment Headquarters at Fort Benning. The detachment was tasked with providing worldwide reconnaissance and operational preparation of the environment in support of the 75th Ranger Regiment and other units within USASOC and JSOC. Traditionally RRD was divided into three six-man teams, one team to support each of the three Ranger battalions.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/75rr.htm The unit has three primary tasks: Active Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Direct Action. While performing these tasks, the teams can: * Infiltrate the objective area by parachute (HALO, HAHO, or static lines), helicopter, fixed- wing aircraft, SCUBA, small boat, foot, or other means. * Remain undetected in the vicinity of the objective area up to five days. * Perform reconnaissance operations employing a full range of night observation devices, infrared detection devices, unattended early warning sensors, and photographic equipment. * Perform demolition target analysis. * Operate small watercraft and inflatable boats. * Emplace unattended ground sensors, omni-directional navigational beacons, hand-emplaced expendable jammers, and electronic target designation devices. * Collect combat information to satisfy priority information requirements and mission-essential elements of information. Teams report information by use of long-range, secure, burst-transmission communications equipment. * Perform drop zone (DZ) selection, marking and reception duties. * Report objective area weather conditions. * Perform highly selective, limited attacks or ambushes when so tasked. * Link up with the main body of the Ranger force in the objective area, or escape and evade the enemy in order to return to friendly lines. When the 75th's Regimental Special Troops Battalion was officially activated in October 2007, RRD changed its name to the Regimental Reconnaissance Company (RRC) and opened its selection course to any soldiers in the U.S. Army who met the established pre- requisites. Selection and training All candidates must complete a month long selection process including navigation from point to point in mountainous terrain. Candidates will walk 12–20 miles per day carrying up to 75lbs in their ruck. On the last day of stress week candidates will walk a total of 40 miles (the long walk). Each selection class will start with as few as 5 and as many as 20 candidates. Each soldier who wants to attend selection must undergo psychological screening and mental aptitude testing along with passing various physical events including the Army PT test. Of the 15-20 candidates who attend selection usually 5-7 will finish and usually only 50% of the ones who finish will actually get selected and have the opportunity to attend the 42-week long Operator Training Course. Combat operations It is assumed that RRD/RRC was involved in Operation Just Cause in Panama in 1989 and Desert Shield/Storm in 1990/1991 as elements of the Ranger Battalions were deployed in both conflicts. In 1994 the 1st and 2nd Battalions and a company of the 3rd Battalion were en route to Haiti. The operation was canceled within five minutes of its commencement due to successful negotiations. While the Ranger Battalions were sent home, an RRD team was forward deployed to provide reconnaissance capabilities for Operation Uphold Democracy. On 24 November 2000 the 75th Ranger Regiment deployed Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment Team 2 and a command and control element to Kosovo in support of Task Force Falcon. RRD has been constantly deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom as many of their skillsets have proven to be invaluable to the warfighting effort.http://www.goarmy.com/ranger/heritage/regimental-special-troops- battalion.html The RRD was placed under JSOC command to conduct Special Reconnaissance for all JSOC units.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 ,p.314 In November 2001, during the invasion of Afghanistan, the 75th Ranger Regiment carried out its second combat parachute drop into Afghanistan: a platoon-sized Ranger security element, including Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment Team 3 conducted the missions: Objective Wolverine, Raptor and Operation Relentless Strike.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.42 Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment Team 3 conducted a combat military freefall parachute drop onto Wrath Drop Zone in southeast Afghanistan on 10 November 2001. This was conducted in order to establish a Flight Landing Strip for follow on combat operations. Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment Team 3 conducted a combat static line parachute drop onto Shiloh Drop Zone in southeast Afghanistan on 21 November 2001. This was conducted in order to establish a flight Landing Strip for follow on combat operations. In July 2004, Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment Team 3 conducted a combat military freefall parachute drop onto Tillman Drop Zone in southeast Afghanistan in order to emplace tactical equipment. In June 2005 members of RRD Team 2 were tasked to help recover the bodies of the United States Navy SEALS killed during Operation Red Wings. During this operation, the team was responsible for hunting down and killing the remaining insurgents who had engaged the SEALS. The team members followed the blood trails and tracked the insurgents to their hiding places and killed them. Once engaged Team 2 was also responsible for killing all of the re-enforcements that came to the aid of the Taliban fighters. In 2006, a six-man RRD (Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment) team attached to the JSOC Task Force inserted into the Hindu Kush mountain range after intelligence indicated an insurgent chief, Haqqani, would be entering Afghanistan from Pakistan. After establishing an OP at a position almost 4,000m above sea level, the RRD team waited and watched for their target, as insurgents arrived into the area, the Ranger team was spotted and fired upon. In response, the RRD's attached JTAC called in an orbiting B-1B strategic bomber to 'pummel' the insurgents, an estimated 100 were killed in the airstrikes but Haqqani was not among them.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 ,p.238-239 On 11 July 2009, Regimental Reconnaissance Company Team 1 conducted a combat military freefall parachute drop with a tandem passenger in Afghanistan in order to emplace tactical equipment. From 2001 until present all RRC teams have been constantly deployed to countries all over the globe in support of combat operations. Each team deploys for at least 1-2 times per year for 4–8 months. They are one of the most heavily deployed elements of the 75th Ranger Regiment.

The fixed C-Arm thereby rotates around the patient and acquires a series of x-ray images that are then reconstructed through software algorithms into a 3D image. Synonyms for rotational angiography include flat-panel volume CT and cone-beam CT. Technical background In order to acquire a 3D image with a fixed C-Arm, the C-Arm is positioned at the body part in question so that this body part is in the isocenter between the x-ray tube and the detector. The C-Arm then rotates around that isocenter, the rotation being between 200° and 360° (depending on the equipment manufacturer). Such a rotation takes between 5 and 20 seconds, during which a few hundred 2D images are acquired. A piece of software then performs a cone beam reconstruction. The resulting voxel data can then be viewed as a multiplanar reconstruction, i.e. by scrolling through the slices from three projection angles, or as a 3D volume, which can be rotated and zoomed. Clinical applications 3D angiography or Rotational Angiography is used in interventional radiology, interventional cardiology and minimally-invasive surgery (e.g., Hybrid cardiac surgical procedure). CT versus rotational angiography Classically, CT imaging has been the method of choice for acquiring 3D data pre- or postoperatively. Choosing between CT and rotational angiography depends on several factors. *The patient positioning on the CT scanner table differs from the positioning on an interventional table during hybrid surgery. Accordingly, to use a preoperative CT image during the procedure, a software registration between the CT image and the life fluoroscopy is required. This takes some time and is not perfectly precise. An article from the heart center in Leipzig suggests that intraoperative 3D imaging with rotational angiography is much more precise and can be performed with low contrast and low radiation dose if combined with diluted contrast injection and rapid ventricular pacing. They found measurements performed on this 3D image highly reliable. *Changes in anatomy: During endovascular procedures, such as the grafting of an aortic aneurysm, 3D planning can be done either on CT image acquired preoperatively or on an intraoperative 3D image acquired by rotational angiography. The CT image is usually acquired a few days or at least hours before the procedure, giving time for planning. However, the anatomy of the vessels can be distorted considerably through the insertion of stiff wires and catheters, making the planning inaccurate. An intraoperative 3D image allows highly accurate planning after the insertion of these tools, and through modern 3D tools it can be done within a few minutes. *Image quality can differ between rotational angiography and CT images. The longer acquisition times of the C-arm image compared to a multislice CT can increase motion artifacts, especially given the typical patient is quite old and not necessarily able to hold his/her breath for the whole image acquisition. Algorithms to reduce these artifacts increase patient dose. Image quality is not only defined through artifacts but also through temporal, spatial, and contrast resolution. The physical characteristics of a flat-panel detector decrease the temporal resolution as the one of the ceramic detectors used in multidetector CT systems. By contrast, the spatial resolution of flat- panel volume CT (rotational angiography using a C-Arm) can be much better than that of a multislice CT scanner, with resolution ranges between 200 and 300 μm in high-resolution mode, compared to up to 600μm for a multislice CT. Contrast resolution, measured in hounsfield units (HU), is only marginally inferior than with a multidetector CT, the difference in attenuation from the background being 5 HU with flat-panel volume CT (=rotational angiography) compared to 3 HU for a multidetector CT. This difference is negligible for most therapeutical applications. Radiation dose X-ray radiation is ionizing radiation, thus exposure is potentially harmful. Compared to a mobile C-Arm, which is classically used in surgery, CT scanners and fixed C-Arms may deliver higher dose and may be operated for longer periods during surgery. It is therefore important to monitor radiation dose to both patient and the medical staff. Rotational angiography may increase the exposure of workers to scattered radiation, as the X-ray source moves around the patient. Lead curtainsare often used at the table side to protect the lower body region, but these are less effective with rotational work. Patient doses can be reduced with techniques common to fluoroscopic imaging such as use of pulsed modes, appropriate collimation and short imaging times.

Introduced in the late 1950s, the Mk.5 has been installed in combat and training aircraft worldwide.Philpott 1989, pp. 81-82. History The Mk.5 seat was developed alongside the Mk.4 design to meet the needs of the United States Navy. Compared to the Mk.4 seat the structure and harnesses were strengthened to withstand higher crash landing loads, this resulted in a slight increase in weight.Martin-Baker Mk.5 fact sheets www.martin-baker.com Retrieved: 15 December 2011 Canopy breaking horns were added to allow ejection through an unjettisoned canopy. Two aircraft types operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force, the RF-84F Thunderflash and the F-86D Sabre, were retro- fitted with Mk.5 seats at the Martin-Baker company's home airfield at Chalgrove. Operation sequence Operating either the seat pan or face blind firing handles initiates aircraft canopy jettison, the main gun located at the rear of the seat then fires, the main gun is a telescopic tube with two explosive charges that fire in sequence. As the seat moves up its guide rails an emergency oxygen supply is activated and personal equipment tubing and communication leads are automatically disconnected, leg restraints also operate. A steel rod, known as the drogue gun, is fired and extracts two small parachutes to stabilise the seat's descent path. A barostatic mechanism prevents the main parachute from opening above an altitude of 10,000 ft (3,000 m) A time delay mechanism operates the main parachute below this altitude in conjunction with another device to prevent the parachute opening at high speed. The seat then separates from the occupant for a normal parachute descent, a manual separation handle and ripcord is provided should the automatic system fail.

Life  Philipp Moritz was the son of Count Philipp Ludwig II of Hanau-Münzenberg and his wife, Princess Catharina Belgica (1578–1648), a daughter of William the Silent.  Youth  Philipp Moritz was seven years old when his father died and he inherited Hanau-Münzenberg. His father's will stipulated that his mother, Princess Catharina Belgica of Nassau, should be the sole regent and guardian, and the Imperial Supreme Court confirmed this. At the age of eight, he was sent to the school that had been established after the Reformation in the buildings of the former monastery at Schlüchtern, which is today the Ulrich von Hutten-Gymnasium. In 1613, he continued his education at University of Basel (where his grandfather had also studied), in Geneva and Sedan.  Reign   End of the regency  Count Philipp Moritz's rule began with an altercation between himself and his mother, Princess Catharina Belgica, about the termination of the regency and nature and the size of her widow seat. She wanted to act as co-regent, even after his 25th birthday, the age of consent under the common law, despite an agreement closed in 1628 and an opinion from the Law Faculty of the University of Marburg. Philipp Moritz, tried to remove his mother from the government. They took their case to the Imperial Supreme Court and treated each other rudely; Philipp Moritz even removed his mother from the countly palace in Hanau. However, he compensated her for this in 1629. They never managed to properly wind up the regency. On the other hand, Philipp Moritz did manage to settle with his cousin Johann Ernst the fierce dispute which his father had had with Johann Ernst's father, his uncle Albrecht of Hanau-Münzenberg-Schwarzenfels, about the primogeniture and Albrecht's apanage.  The Thirty Years' War and exile  One reason the regency was never properly wound up, was the Thirty Years' War, which approached Hanau around 1630. When the Imperial troops reached Hanau, Philipp Moritz chose their side, in order to retain the military command of his capital. He was appointed Colonel and was expected to provide three companies. In November 1631, Swedish troops occupied Hanau and King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden entered the city. Philipp Moritz decided to change sides. He was a Calvinist and for him choosing between the Catholic Emperor and the Lutheran Swedish king may have been like a choice between Scylla and Charybdis. Gustavus Adolphus appointed him to colonel and gave him a Swedish regiment. As a reward for his changing side, he gave him the district of Orb and the shares the Electorate of Mainz had held in the former County of Rieneck and the districts of Partenstein, Lohrhaupten, Bieber and Alzenau. He gave Philipp Moritz's brothers, Heinrich Ludwig (1609–1632) and Jakob Johann (1612–1636) the town and district of Steinheim, which was also a former possession of Mainz. These possessions were lost when the Catholic side gained the upper hand after the Battle of Nördlingen in September 1634. Changing sides again would make Philipp Moritz seem untrustworthy, so he decided to flee. He fled to Metz and from there via Chalon, Rouen and Amsterdam to his Orange-Nassau relatives in the Hague and Delft. He left his youngest brother, Jakob Johann, as regent in Hanau, because Jakob Johann was considered politically neutral. Hanau was a well-developed fortress town and remained occupied until 1638 by Swedish troops under General Jakob von Ramsay, who controlled the surrounding countryside from Hanau. He excluded Jakob Johann from any influence and so the later left the city. Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen used the occupation of Hanau by the Swedish as background in his picaresque novel Simplicius Simplicissimus.  Return from exile  From September 1635 to June 1636, Hanau was unsuccessfully besieged by imperial troops under General Guillaume de Lamboy. This siege proved the value of the modern defensive system, which had been constructed only a few years before. Thousands of refugees fled from the surrounding villages into the city. After a nine-month siege, the city was relieved by an army under Landgrave Wilhelm V of Hesse- Kassel. He was Philipp Moritz's brother-in-law, as he had married Philipp Moritz's sister, Amalie Elisabeth. A church service was held annually to commemorate the relief. After 1800, this developed into an annual Lamboy festival. In 1637, Philipp Moritz reconciled with the new Emperor, Ferdinand III and changed sides again, back to the Catholic side. He returned to Hanau on 17 December 1637. General Ramsay ignored this and interned Philipp Moritz in the City Castle. He was obviously hoping to receive Hanau as a fief. However, on , Johann Winter von Güldenborn, a major in the Hanau army, supported by members of the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts, staged a coup against the Swedes. He drove them out of Hanau and restored Philipp Moritz to power.Dietrich, Im Handstreich General Ramsay was arrested and taken to Dillenburg, where he died months later from injuries he sustained during this action.  Trivium  Philipp Moritz was a member of the Fruitbearing Society, under the nickname .  Death  Philipp Moritz died on 3 August 1638 and was buried in the family crypt his father had established in the Church of St. Mary in Hanau.  Marriage and Issue  Philipp Moritz returned to Hanau in 1626 and married Princess Sibylle Christine of Anhalt-Dessau. They had the following children: # Sibylle Mauritania (2 November 1630 - 24 March 1631). She was buried in the family vault in the St. Mary's Church in Hanau. The remains were reburied in 1879 in a new coffin, as the old one had rotted.Suchier, grave monuments, p. 25 ff # Adolphine (31 October 1631 - 22 December 1631). Baptized on 4 December 1631.

Johann Heinrich died while his relatives had fled from Hanau to the Netherlands. Because of the war, he was initially buried in Zweibrücken in 1635.

The creators acknowledge the presence of the interagency contributions to the foreign affairs realm, and welcome additional content to showcase the achievements of African-Americans in other relevant USG agencies. African-Americans have mobilized to make visible issues to be reflected in American foreign policy decisions. African-Americans continue to leverage knowledge of global issues and create linkages with people of color throughout the world to gain insight and allies in the struggle for equal rights. Whether the influence came from civic organizations, religious institutions or charismatic leaders, the African-American voice has not been silent in articulating their views on how foreign policy should be created. African–Americans also made recommendations and participated in the formation of foreign policy of the United States to shape domestic policy regarding civil and human rights. The first African American diplomat, Yale graduate Ebenezer Don Carlos Bassett, was appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant as Minister Resident and Consul General in Haiti in 1869. From Bassett's appointment in 1869 through the 1930s, the United States sent scores of African American ministers, consuls, and other officials to regions including Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Many of these officials (including Frederick Douglass, James Weldon Johnson, Archibald Grimké, George Washington Ellis, and Henry Francis Downing) were also literary writers, and their work in international diplomacy influenced the ways in which they approached racial diplomacy during the New Negro era and the Harlem Renaissance. Between Bassett's appointment in 1869, every appointed ambassador to Haiti was African American until Madison Roswell Smith was appointed in 1912. It was not until 1924 when the Rogers Act combined the Consular and Diplomatic Service that James Carter and William Yerby became the first African Americans to enter the regular career Foreign Service. They were joined by Clifton Wharton, Sr. who was named Ambassador to Norway in 1961. After Wharton, Sr., no other African American entered the Foreign Service for the next 20 years. During this period, the U.S. Agency for International Development and its predecessor organization also hired a number of African Americans who distinguished themselves as senior diplomats. African American ambassadors and senior diplomats have not all come from the ranks of the State Department and USAID. The former United States Information Agency began an active recruitment effort aimed at African Americans in the latter part of the 1950s and 1960s and attracted numerous officers who achieved ambassadorial rank. African Americans have also played a major role in international affairs with the United Nations and United States Congress. Recent efforts made by Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright, Colin L. Powell and Condoleezza Rice, and Hillary Clinton to increase diversity in the Department and to attract more minorities to the Foreign Service bode well for augmenting the under-representative number of African Americans in the Service and for achieving a broader geographical distribution of African American Ambassadors throughout the world. Pioneers in the industry This section spotlights pioneers in the industry, the first African-Americans to represent the U.S. government abroad, and those who have represented the U.S. government foreign affairs agencies at the highest levels. First African-American diplomat Ebenezer Don Carlos Basset was the first African-American diplomat . He was Minister Resident and Consul General in Haiti from 1869 to 1877.

He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1834 while living in New Orleans. While living in California, he became a Mexican citizen in 1844 in order to increase his landholdings. His service as Vice Consul lasted until U.S. forces occupied northern California in July 1846. Leidesdorff died in San Francisco on May 18, 1848. First African-American Ambassador Edward R.

She was also the first woman who held the title of Assistant Secretary, and later served as Ambassador to Malaysia in 1980–81. First African-American to Represent the United States at the United Nations Edith S. Sampson is an American diplomat who was appointed by President Harry Truman as an alternate U.S. delegate to the United Nations in August 1950, making her the first African-American to officially represent the United States at the UN.

He is committed to pursuing foreign policy challenges including: bringing a responsible end\\" to the war in Iraq and refocusing on the broader region; Building the first truly 21st century military and showing wisdom in how we deploy it; Marshalling a global effort\\" to secure, destroy, and stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction; Rebuilding and constructing the alliances and partnerships necessary to meet common challenges and confront common threats,\\" including global warming; and investing in our common humanity through foreign aid and supporting the pillars of a sustainable democracy – a strong legislature, an independent judiciary, the rule of law, a vibrant civil society, a free press, and an honest police force.

An ad hoc committee consisting of Randall Robinson, Herschelle Challenor, and Willard Johnson formulated an organization design. On July 1, 1977, TransAfrica a nonprofit organization was incorporated in Washington, D.C., with Randall Robinson as executive director. The primary human rights issue of the day was the unjust apartheid regime in South Africa.

Herter Sr., was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Republican from Massachusetts in 1942, and in 1953 was elected Governor of Massachusetts. In 1959, the elder Mr. Herter became the United States Secretary of State under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Herter's mother, the former Mary Caroline Pratt, was a granddaughter of Charles Pratt, a partner in Standard Oil of New Jersey and the founder of the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. He received his bachelor's from Harvard University. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1948 and eventually joined the Boston law firm of Bingham, Dana & Gould, where he became an authority on helping U.S. companies trying to expand into the international market.

The party backed Herter to run for attorney general. He lost the general election to Democrat Edward J. McCormack.

Lindsay appointed him as one of the inaugural members of the Urban Coalition, a group of business, labour and neighbourhood leaders created to aid the city's slums. Mr. Herter was the coalition's chairman until 1969. In 1970 President Nixon appointed Herter to the post of deputy assistant secretary of state for environmental and population affairs. Mr. Herter later taught environmental law at the University of New Mexico and international law at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan appointed him deputy United States commissioner on the International Whaling Commission.Notice of Appointment Herter later served chairman of the U.S. Section of the International Joint Commission of the United States and Canada.

He graduated from the University of Texas at Austin, where he was a member of the Texas Longhorns swimming team, one of the top collegiate swim programmes under two-time United States Olympic men's head coach Eddie Reese. He first qualified for the Olympics in 2012 after winning the 200 m butterfly at the 2011 SEA Games. Personal life and family Joseph Schooling was born and raised in Singapore, being a fourth-generation Singaporean. Joseph Schooling is the only child of May and Colin Schooling, and is of Eurasian ethnicity. May is a Malaysian and a Singapore Permanent Resident who had represented the Malaysian state of Perak in tennis; while Colin, a businessman born in Singapore and educated at Raffles Institution, was a hurdler and water polo player who represented Singapore in softball. His grand-uncle, Lloyd Valberg, was Singapore's first Olympian in the 1948 Summer Olympics. He was the one who inspired Schooling to participate in the Olympics. Schooling's great grandfather was a British military officer who married a Portuguese-Eurasian in Singapore. Schooling's early years of education were spent at the Anglo-Chinese School (Junior) in Singapore. He next attended Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), but left for the United States in 2009 when he was 14 years old to attend Bolles School in Jacksonville, Florida. In 2010, Schooling started training under Sergio Lopez Miro, who later on in 2015 would become Singapore's national head coach. In 2014, after completing high school, he enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin. In August 2016, Schooling had his National Service deferred until after the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. The Armed Forces Council had approved Schooling's request to extend his deferment, as he had been exemplary in fulfilling the “raison d’etre” for his deferment from 2013 to the 2016 Olympics. In October 2016, Schooling received the Pingat Jasa Gemilang (Meritorious Service Medal) for his exceptional achievements at the Rio Olympics 2016 by winning Singapore's first ever Olympic gold medal in the men's 100m butterfly.Swimmers Joseph Schooling, Theresa Goh to receive National Day Awards, , 18 July 2017News Article by Low Lin Fhoong, National Day Awards for swimmers Schooling, Goh, , TODAY Online, 7 October 2016By Akshay Ramesh, Singapore swimmers Joseph Schooling, Theresa Goh to receive National Day Awards, International Business Times, Singapore Edition, 6 October 2016By Nicole Chia from The Straits Times, Swimmer Joseph Schooling receives SGD$1 million for Olympic gold medal, AsiaOne, 24 November 2016 On 7 August 2017, an Orchid was named after Schooling; Dendrobium Joseph Schooling is a \\"vigorous and free flowering\\" hybrid with yellow and slightly twisted petals.Written by NC, Orchids named after Joseph Schooling, Yip Pin Xiu, Channel NewsAsia, 7 August 2017By editor Lester Wong for ST News, Swimming: Olympic champ Joseph Schooling, Paralympic champ Yip Pin Xiu have orchids named after them, The Straits Times, 7 August 2017By Cheng Jingwen AsiaOne, Swimmers Joseph Schooling and Yip Pin Xiu get orchids named after them, 7 August 2017, AsiaOne Singaporesports article – Joseph Schooling, Yip Pin Xiu have orchids named after them, TODAYonline, 7 August 2017 On 27 June 2018, Schooling launched his swimming school called Swim Schooling.

In 2020, Schooling and fellow national swimmer Quah Zheng Wen applied to further extend their National Service deferment, given the postponement of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics due to the COVID-19 situation. Collegiate career 2015 NCAA Schooling won two individual titles (100 & 200-yard butterfly) at the 2015 NCAA Division I Men's Swimming and Diving Championships. His other title came from the 400-yard medley relay. He teamed up with Kip Darmody, Will Licon and Jack Conger to break the NCAA and US Open records. In the 200-yard medley relay, he was a member of the Texas team that finished third. Schooling also swam in the 200-yard medley consolation final (finishing first) and the 400-yard freestyle relay where Texas finished fourth. Texas won the National Championships with 528 points. It was the Longhorns' eleventh overall men's team title. 2016 NCAA Schooling successfully defended his butterfly titles, setting both NCAA and US open records of 44.01 in the 100-yard butterfly and 1:37.97 in the 200-yard butterfly at the 2016 NCAA Division I Men's Swimming and Diving Championships. He also won golds as a member of the 200 and 800-yard freestyle relays and the 400-yard medley relay. His silver came from the 400-yard freestyle relay and bronze from the 200-yard medley relay. Texas won the National Championships with 541 points. It was the Longhorns' second consecutive and twelfth overall men's team title. 2017 NCAA Schooling obtained four gold medals, a silver and a bronze medal at the 2017 NCAA Division I Men's Swimming and Diving Championships. His gold medals came from the 200 and 400-yard medley relays and the 200 and 400-yard freestyle relays. Texas set new NCAA and US open records in all of the relays he was involved except for the 200-yard medley relay. Schooling started off his individual campaign with a bronze in the 50-yard freestyle in 18.79 behind Caeleb Dressel and Ryan Held. He was unable to defend his butterfly titles, finishing behind Dressel in the 100-yard butterfly in 43.75 (2nd man fastest all-time). In the 200-yard butterfly, he failed to make the finals, finishing 37th overall. Texas won the National Championships with 542 points. It was the Longhorns' third consecutive and thirteenth overall men's team title. 2018 NCAA A closely contested meet sees Texas, California, Indiana and NC state fighting for the Championship title till the last day. Texas won the 2018 NCAA Division I Men's Swimming and Diving Championships with 449 points, edging out California. It was the Longhorns' fourth consecutive and fourteenth overall men's team title. Schooling ended his collegiate career at the University of Texas with 12 NCAA titles (4 individuals & 8 relays). International career In the early part of his career, Schooling was trained by coaches and swimmers of Australia under the monitoring of Monash University in a Singapore Sports Council programme. At the 2011 Southeast Asian Games, Schooling's 1:56.67 winning time in the 200 fly met the \\"A\\" qualifying mark for the 2012 London Olympics. Unfortunately, he did not qualify for the semi-finals after finishing poorly in his heats where swimming officials disallowed the use of his swimming cap and goggles, causing him to have to search for new ones just minutes before the competition, affecting his state of mind. Schooling is the first Singaporean to win a swimming medal at the Commonwealth Games, taking silver in the 100 m butterfly at the 2014 games in Glasgow. 2014 Asian Games Schooling's major breakthrough finally came during the Asian Games, where he clocked 51.76 seconds in the 100 m butterfly finals. Schooling's timing of 51.76 seconds was a new Asian Games record. It was Singapore's first Asian Games gold in the men's category since 1982. Schooling had earlier won a bronze for the 200 m butterfly event, ending a 24-year medal drought for Singapore's male swimming event. He followed that by winning a silver in the 50 m butterfly event. 2015 SEA Games At the 2015 SEA Games held in Singapore, Schooling took part in nine events, achieving gold and breaking Games records in all of them. Schooling's time of 22.47 seconds in the 50 m freestyle broke a 33-year national record (22.69 s) that was held by Ang Peng Siong, who had set it at the 1982 U.S. Swimming Championships. 2015 FINA World Championships Schooling continued with his streak of achievements in the 2015 World Aquatics Championships. He advanced to the 50 m and 100 m butterfly finals, breaking the National Records for both events. In the 50 m butterfly event, he broke the Asian Record in the semi-finals before breaking it again in the finals with a time of 23.25 seconds, while in the 100 m butterfly event, he broke the Asian Record in the finals, with a time of 50.96 seconds. His bronze medal was Singapore's first ever medal at the FINA World Aquatics Championships. 2016 Olympics On 12 August 2016, in Rio de Janeiro, Schooling won a gold medal in the 100 m butterfly with a time of 50.39 seconds, the first Olympic gold medal won by Singapore. The time set a new Olympic record, beating Phelps' record of 50.58 seconds at the 2008 Summer Olympics. In the semi-finals on 11 August 2016, Schooling swam 50.83 seconds as the fastest qualifier for the final. The time was a personal best, a national record, an Asian record, and the fastest time then-recorded in 2016 for the event, but only for a day as Schooling improved his time in the final. The Singapore National Olympic Council awarded Schooling S$1 million (about US$740,000) under the Multi-Million Dollar Award Programme (MAP), 20% of which had to be ploughed back to the Singapore Swimming Association for future training and development. Singapore's unique \\"rewards for sports excellence\\" is deemed to be the world's largest Olympic cash prize. As a University of Texas collegiate swimmer, Schooling was subject to the NCAA's strict rules against amateur sportsmen accepting monetary compensation. However, Schooling received his country's award as it fell within the NCAA exception of awards to foreign students which allow the high cost of sports training to be defrayed. To mark Schooling's historic gold medal, a victory parade was held in Singapore and it was attended by massive crowds.http://www.prischew.com/sports/crowds-greet-olympic-gold-medallist- joseph-schooling-at-marine-terrace/ Schooling's performance in Rio was listed in swimming magazine Swim Swam's Top 10 Swims Of 2016.

Introduced in the 1950s, the Mk.4 has been installed in combat and training aircraft worldwide.Philpott 1989, pp. 77-78. History The Mk.4 seat was designed as an improved, lightweight version of earlier Martin-Baker seats for installation in a range of lighter, smaller aircraft types.Martin- Baker Mk.4 fact sheets www.martin-baker.com Retrieved: 15 December 2011 Improvements included a single combined seat and parachute quick release fastener (QRF) and a snubber mechanism to allow crews to lean forward without loosening the harness. The first successful ejection using a Mk.4 seat took place in March 1957, the aircraft involved being a Fiat G.91.Philpott 1989, p. 77. Operation sequence Operating either the seat pan or face blind firing handles initiates aircraft canopy jettison, the main gun located at the rear of the seat then fires, the main gun is a telescopic tube with two explosive charges that fire in sequence. As the seat moves up its guide rails an emergency oxygen supply is activated and personal equipment tubing and communication leads are automatically disconnected, leg restraints also operate. Once the seat is safely clear of the aircraft a steel rod, known as the drogue gun, is fired which extracts two small drogue parachutes to stabilise the seat's descent path. A barostatic mechanism prevents the main parachute from opening above an altitude of 10,000 ft (3,000 m) allowing the seat and pilot to descend rapidly in free fall so conserving the on-seat oxygen supply until normally-breathable atmospheric air becomes available. A time delay mechanism operates the main parachute below this altitude in conjunction with another device to prevent the parachute opening at high speed to prevent possible parachute canopy damage. The seat then separates from the occupant for a normal parachute descent, a manual separation handle and ripcord is provided should the automatic system fail.

Amongst the town's most significant buildings, it has a Grade I listing and is one of 24 sites on the Monmouth Heritage Trail. The house is located on Castle Hill, off Agincourt Square in Monmouth town centre. Described as \\"a house of splendid swagger outside and in\\", it was completed in 1673 for Henry Somerset, the 3rd Marquis of Worcester, who was Lord President of the Council of Wales and the Marches. It later became an Assize Court, until the Court moved to the new Shire Hall in 1725. It has been the Headquarters of Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers (Militia) since the mid-19th century, and contains the Regimental Museum. History and architecture When Worcester was appointed to the post of President of the Council of Wales and the Marches, he decided that he needed a seat in the Marches appropriate to his status. The house was primarily intended to be used for ceremonial and official, rather than domestic, purposes. The architect is unknown. The house was built of mottled pink and grey blocks of Old Red Sandstone, probably mostly reused from the gatehouse and Great Tower of the castle, which were wholly or partly demolished after the Civil War; much has been renewed more recently. The remains of the castle stand in the far left- hand side of the courtyard in front of the house. The facade of the house is severely symmetrical with an elegant and decorative doorway. The two side wings are 19th-century additions to a building that originally stood alone. The interior is described as \\"astonishing\\", particularly for its plasterwork. On the first floor there is a large room with extravagantly decorated ceilings; this was originally five rooms, later combined as the main courtroom. The plasterwork was mostly made by travelling craftsmen using established patterns, but has been lavishly and ostentatiously fashioned with pendant floral festoons laced with ribbons in what were originally the Marquis's private rooms. Shortly after building Great Castle House, Worcester was created Duke of Beaufort, and needed still larger houses, first at Troy House and then at Badminton House, leaving Great Castle House to be repanelled for the Assizes. When the Assizes moved to Shire Hall in 1725, the house became lodgings for the judges (though part of it was let to a maker of drainage pipes), but later they moved to less spacious lodgings in the town, and from about 1760 the house provided a high-class school for young ladies. Castle and Regimental Museum In 1853, it became the headquarters of the Militia Regiment, later the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers, the Senior Regiment of the Reserve Army. Most of the building remains as the regiment's headquarters, but part now houses the Castle and Regimental Museum, established in 1989, which is open in the afternoon in summer. The Museum opens onto the King's Garden, containing plants known to have been growing at the time of Henry V (1386–1422), who was born in the castle. The museum displays include regimental artefacts and regalia, the importance of the Dukes of Beaufort, the earlier defences of Monmouth and its castle, HMS Monmouth, and the military activities of the regiment from its founding to the present.

It is published by Japanese company Akaneshinsha and serialized in New Youth Express. The story is about kid named Shautieh Ley and the humiliation he puts himself and his opponents through in bowling alleys.  Plot  The story begins with Shautieh Ley in high school, after his internet girlfriend breaks up with him. After he skips class with his best friend Houshin, he meets Tz'Zuhn, a highschool girl, and immediately falls in love with her. They are confronted by a gang in public, due to Shautieh having angered his teacher. Shautieh challenges them to an arm wrestling match and wins, thanks to his abnormally powerful left arm, leaving unharmed. Shautieh challenges Edgar to a bowling match and Edgar accepts. Shautieh trains by locking himself up in a room and studying many recorded videos of professional bowlers from around the world, an act which makes him develop a fever. During that match, after showing off Bruce Ray and Don Carter's Techniques, he shows off his photographic memory capabilities and performs Edgar's own 3-step approach. And so Shautieh trains for the upcoming God's Hand Cup for his rematch against Edgar as he will be participating on it as well along with a few more contenders.  Characters  Shautieh Ley : The protagonist of the series. A high school boy who has a powerful left arm that is strong enough to beat a bodybuilder in an arm wrestling contest and even smash a car's hood by punching it through. Shautieh Ley has the amazing ability of photographic memory and so is able to copy a person's movement when bowling and usually achieve the same results, what ignites his bowling career. With his strong left arm and some bowling videos of other famous bowlers, he sets off to conquer the bowling alleys with his newfound skill and his dirty hijinks. : When facing against an opponent, he usually breaks their concentration by impersonating pop culture idols or performing ridiculous stunts even at his own expense. A theme develops when Shautieh receives a disadvantage, usually before an important match which can include having a broken arm or having diarrhea and thus must rely on his own tricks to win the said bowling match. Tz'Zuhn : A highschool girl who works at the bowling alley that her father owns. She is seen as beautiful, although having a hot temper, and usually has to put up with Shautieh and his hijinks. Her father is struggling with the bowling alley, due to her brother leaving the family with a large debt and going missing shortly after. She is in a relationship with Edgar after meeting him when he first visits Japan for a bowling match. After a series of events she realises she is in love with Shautieh. Houshin : Shautieh's best and only friend. He is usually around to help Shautieh with his hijinks, usually against his will. However, he is loyal to Shautieh, going as far as to doing everything he can to help Shautieh in his time of need. Edgar : Tz'Zuhn's significant other who is 27 years old, originally from Mexico and lives in New York as a popular professional bowler. He was once engaged to Lily back in New York but during a bachelor party, a terrible accident happened resulting in the death of a stripper, with Lily's brother taking the blame for it. Her brother commits suicide because of it and Edgar's engagement has been broken off since. He is now in a relationship with Tz'Zuhn. Lily : The loan shark's companion who is a professional bowler. She was once engaged with Edgar back in New York but after a terrible accident involving the death of her brother, they split up, and she moved to Japan afterwards. After bowling with Shautieh, she leaves the loan shark and appears later to watch Shautieh's matches. Yen Ni : Daughter of the rich businessman who is hosting a bowling tournament. She is a vain girl who considers herself more beautiful than any other girl in the world. After being rejected by Shautieh, she makes it her mission to get him to fall in love with her so she can dump him and make his life miserable. However, most of her attempts at seducing Shautieh are usually dismissed or backfire, and end up with her suffering something as dire as anesthesia or breaking her toe. : Later in the series, her family loses all their money, along with their properties, and she is forced to leave her more trifling matters aside to focus on her own subsistence, along with her brother, who ends up facing the same issues. Jen Ni : He is Yen Ni 's brother, a womanizing and prideful man, albeit a skilled bowler. He prefers to continue bowling and as such, does not plan on inheriting his father's company. He becomes infatuated with Tz'Zuhn when she starts working as a maid on his family's mansion as a result of one of Yen Ni's plans, and vows to conquer her heart. He is frequently at odds with Shautieh because of that, resulting in a bowling match between the two of them. Maruko Sisters : A group of triplets who are Shautieh's first self-proclaimed fans. They're short and chubby girls who later appear in Shautieh's matches, cheering for him. They're determined to learn everything there is to know about him, and provide many laughs with their crazed attempts at keeping Shautieh in a good condition during matches.  Bowling Techniques  Bruce Ray's Cross Grip : In the first match between Shautieh and Edgar, Shautieh performs the cross grip which involves a stance with both hands on the ball, to form a cross, while gripping on the ball and using a pendulum movement to increase the force of the ball when thrown towards the pins. Don Carter's Pitcher Delivery : In the same match between Shautieh and Edgar, Shautieh performs Don Carter's self invented delivery pitch, a technique created to take advantage of a strong arm that Don Carter developed in his days of baseball before playing Bowling.

Plot summary The \\"Long Earth\\" is a (possibly infinite) series of parallel worlds that are similar to Earth, which can be reached by using an inexpensive device called a \\"Stepper\\". The \\"close\\" worlds are almost identical to \\"our\\" Earth (referred to as \\"Datum Earth\\"), others differ in greater and greater details, but all share one similarity: on none are there, or have there ever been, Homo sapiens – although the same cannot be said of earlier hominid species, especially Homo habilis. The book deals primarily with the journey of Joshua Valienté (a natural \\"Stepper\\") and Lobsang, who claims to be a Tibetan motorcycle repairman reincarnated as an artificial intelligence. The two chart a course to learn as much as possible about the parallel worlds, travelling millions of steps away from the original Earth. They encounter evidence of other humanoid species (referred to as trolls and elves); of human settlers who learned their gifts early – including Sally Linsay, daughter of the inventor of the stepper, who joins them on their expedition; and of an extinct race of bipedal dinosaur descendants. They also encounter warning signs of a great danger, millions of worlds away from \\"our\\" Earth, causing catastrophe as it moves. The book also deals with the effects of the explosion of available space on the people of Datum Earth and the new colonies and political movements that are spreading in the wake of Step Day. A young girl, Helen Green, and her family (with the exception of her brother, Rod, who is unable to step) trek across the long earth to form a new community, Reboot, on Earth West 101,754. After stepping across \\"The Gap\\" – a universe around two million steps from the Datum where the Earth no longer exists – Joshua and Lobsang encounter the threat that has caused the slow migration of Trolls away from the gap. First Person Singular is a being that absorbs other sentient life forms, eventually taking over everything on earth before stepping to the next. It currently cannot pass The Gap. Lobsang elects to stay in First Person Singular's universe and commune with it, in the hopes of convincing it not to advance further, or at least to not absorb all other sentients. Joshua and Sally return to Datum Earth back the way they came. Upon reaching Earth West 101,754, they hear news that Datum Madison has been destroyed in a nuclear explosion, the result of a bomb planted by a terrorist group of humans incapable of stepping (called \\"phobics\\" in the book's terminology). The book ends with the two of them briefly seeing the explosion site, before retreating to Earth West 1 Madison, where a backed- up instantiation of Lobsang contacts Joshua by phone. Characters *Joshua Valienté: an orphan, born on another world when his mother stepped during childbirth. A natural stepper. *Lobsang: an artificial intelligence who claims to be a reincarnated Tibetan motorcycle repairman. *Sally Linsay: daughter of the inventor of the \\"Stepper\\" box, a device that allows the majority of humans to step between parallel universes. A natural stepper and later romantic interest to Joshua Valienté. *Monica Jansson: A Madison Police Officer who helps the disappearing children on \\"Step Day\\" - the day when the blueprint for the Stepper Box is released on the internet. *Helen Green: a young girl who sets off across the long earth with most of her family to start a new community. Keeps a diary of her travels. *Rod Green: brother to Helen Green, a boy who cannot step and is left on Datum Earth by his family as they travel across the long earth. Later helps in the bombing of Madison where he is captured and imprisoned. *Sister Agnes: a nun who looks after Joshua during his younger years at the orphanage. *Douglas Black: founder of the Black Corporation, a high-profile research based weapons and technology company and manufacturer. Creator of Lobsang. *First Person Singular: a being found on the far side of \\"The Gap\\", more than two million steps from earth, that absorbs all sentient life. *Mark Twain: an airship with a certain level of artificial intelligence granted by the Black Corporation and Lobsang, allowing it, and those within it, to step. The Mark Twain, named after the author who penned the adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, carries Joshua and Lobsang on their journey across the long earth. Reception Reviewing the book in The Guardian, Adam Roberts found it to be \\"much more like a Baxter novel than a Pratchett one.\\" It was also said to be \\"a charming, absorbing and somehow spacious piece of imagineering.\\" The book reached 13th on the New York Times hardback best-sellers list on 8 July 2012.Best Sellers July 08, 2012, The New York Times The novel won the Goodreads Choice Awards 2012 for Science Fiction.

Princeton; Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2005.] What type of agenda settings are shaping young Canadians? What is the trend in youth civic and political engagement in Canada? To what degree do political activities influence young Canadian voters? How do social differences influence the structure of society? An analysis of basic theoretical reasons behind the low voter turnout of young Canadians was done based on quantitative and qualitative research. The analysis reported some factors that contributed to the unwillingness of youth to vote and to participate in democracy: 1. Social Factors, different implications of youth values from older generation.[Mackinnon, Mary Pat. , Pitre, Sonia. , and Watling Judy. \\"Lost in Translation: (Mis) Understanding Youth Engagement: Synthesis Report.\\" Canadian Policy Research Networks. Oct 2007. Web. 26 Nov 2011. < www.cprn.ca/documents/48800_FR.pdf>] 2\\\\. Institutional Factor, differences in Political discourses. It will highlight demographic trends in Canada and have created this new fixation on age as a major determinant of political participation and public policy.[MacManus, Susan A. Young Vs. Old: Generational Combat in the 21st Century.Colorado; Oxford: Westview Press, Inc., A Division of HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 1996. P. 4.] Also, what is the role of newspaper to engage with the young voters? There is no particular reason to attribute low voter turnout to any one factor, though some factors may be more important than others.[Pammett, Jon. H., and LeDuc, Lawrence. \\"Explaining the Turnout Decline in Canadian Federal Elections: A New Survey of Non-voters.\\" Elections Canada. Carleton; Toronto: Mar 2003. Web. 14 Oct 2011. P. 8] The assessment of political activity Poster in a shop window in Kensington Market, Toronto, October 2015, during the federal election campaign. It contains the words of political commentator of Rick Mercer.Canadian electoral participants attribute \\"turnout decline to negative public attitudes toward the performance of the politicians and political institutions involved in federal politics.\\"[Ibid. P. 7 ] \\"When it came to the question of asking whether politics is a way for the powerful to themselves or, instead, a way for the less powerful to compete on equal footing, more respondents in both countries chose the cynical view.\\" [Milner, Henry. \\"Political Knowledge and Participation Among Young Canadians and Americans\\" Institute for Research on Public Policy. Nov 2007. Web. 11 Nov 2011. < www.irpp.org/wp/archive/wp2007-01.pdf>] A survey done across the nation shows a clear plurality: 49% disapprove of the way Stephen Harper, Prime Minister and leader of Conservative Party of Canada, is handling his job compared to Barack Obama, President of The United States, whose disapproval rate is 12%.[\\"Election Anyone?: Speaker's Ruling May Not Tempt Any Party To Force An Election.\\" Ekos Politics. 29 Apr 2010. Web. 04 Nov 2011. P. 13 ] Since voting is evidently central to citizens' politics in representative democracies, it is unsurprising that young participants' attitudes to politics were partly shaped by their perceptions of their position in relation to this most basic of political citizenship rights. Indeed, Synthesis Report by Canadian Policy Research Networks reports that youths do not tend to connect the role of government with the issues they think are important.[Mackinnon, Mary Pat. , Pitre, Sonia. , and Watling Judy. \\"Lost in Translation: (Mis) Understanding Youth Engagement: Synthesis Report.\\" Canadian Policy Research Networks. Oct 2007. Web. 26 Nov 2011. < www.cprn.ca/documents/48800_FR.pdf>]  The changing style of political discourse  There are roughly four times as many votes registered by seniors than by younger voters. This effect is compounded by dramatic differences in political preferences with seniors being more than twice as likely to favour conservative choices than younger voters. \\"In a decade or two, the younger voters will be in the prime of their lives and paying for the political choices of their now departed grandparents which are not likely to reflect the priorities or, one could speculate, the needs of next Canada.\\"[Graves, Frank. \\"The Looming Legitimacy Crisis: Time to Take the Discretionary out of Democracy?\\" Ekos Politics. 21 Oct 2011. Web. 22 Nov 2011. P.2. < http://www.ekospolitics.com/index.php/2011/10/the-looming-legitimacy- crisis-october-21-2011/>] In other words, this phenomenon is age-related, as there are variations in the personal relevance of the issues that typically dominate the political discourse.[ Gidengil, Elizabeth. , Blais, Andre. , Everitt, Joanna., Fournier, Patrick., and Nevitte, Neil. \\"Missing the Message Young Adults and the Election Issues.\\" Elections Canada. Web. 18 Nov 2011. ] Disengagement from the political agenda setting becomes significant as the age of our population rises, but their relative clout has been dramatically magnified by the declining voting rates of younger citizens. The commentary on youth disengagement suggests that \\"young Canadians are turned off by electoral politics because party platforms and party leaders pay too little attention to the issues that really concerned younger citizens.\\"[Ibid. P.3.] Nanos Research conducted a survey for individuals aged 18 years or older between August 13 and September 30, 2011, to question, \\"What is your most important PROVINCIAL issue of concern?\\" And the research data identifies they mostly concern the health 26.4% from February 2010, 23.2%.[Nano, John. \\"What is your most important PROVINCIAL issue of concern?\\" Nanos Research. 01 Oct 2011. Web. 05 Oct 2011. ] And only 16% of those named job/economy as their second most important.[Ibid.] The number one issue for young Canadians was health. Another survey was conducted by Elections Canada to pinpoint the most important issue in the election and Canadians aged 18 to over 60 were asked to select the issue that was most important to them personally.[Gidengil, Elizabeth. , Blais, Andre. , Everitt, Joanna., Fournier, Patrick., and Nevitte, Neil. \\"Missing the Message Young Adults and the Election Issues.\\" Elections Canada. Web. 18 Nov 2011. P.3. ] One of the common issues was health. Indeed, a striking finding from the survey data is how similar the priorities of Canadians are, regardless of their age. Evidently, Ekos Politics constructed a survey in October 2010 that asked which party you would vote for if a federal election were held tomorrow. The result of Ontario vote intention was Progressive Conservative Party 36.0% and Liberal 34.2% second.[Election Anyone?: Speaker's Ruling May Not Tempt Any Party To Force An Election.\\" Ekos Politics. 29 Apr 2010. Web. 04 Nov 2011. P. 9. ] However, a year later, the new data justified an adjustment in Ontario 2011 Election from PC 34.0% to Liberal 38.6% since the 2010 elections.[\\"EKOS' Final Poll For The 2011 Ontario Election: …And A Few Comment On Why This Isn't Our Most Important Poll.\\" Ekos Politics. 05 Oct 2011.

Web. 14 Nov 2011. ] The end result of the Ontario election evaluates the notion that people's involvement in alternative political behaviour is central to assessing their level of political interest.[Milan, Anne. \\"Willing to participate: Political engagement of young adults.\\" Statistics Canada. 2005. Web. 28 Oct 2011. P. 3. < www.statcan.gc.ca/kits-trousses/pdf/social/edu04_0155a-eng.pdf>]  Political knowledge and trust  \\"Political knowledge is a democratic value. It is also an important ingredient in democratic citizenship, influencing public attitudes and opinions and, thus political behaviour.\\"Milner, Henry.\\"Political Knowledge and Participation Among Young Canadians and Americans\\", Institute for Research on Public Policy. Nov 2007. Web. 11 Nov 2011. Young Canadians display a pattern of civic and political engagement that differentiates them from other aged groups. According to Henry Milner, the political knowledge centralizes to the young voter decline.[Ibid] Brenda O'Neil supports Milner's analysis by saying, \\"counterintuitively, cynicism toward government and the political system is generally lower among young Canadians than among older ones, and have greater confidence in party leaders and candidates than older generations.O'Neil, Brenda. \\"Indifferent or Just Different? The Political and Civic Engagement of Young People in Canada: Charting the Course for Youth Civic and Political Participation.\\", Canadian Policy Research Networks. Jun 2007. Web. 31 Oct 2011. Both Milner and O'Neil argue young voter participants have a strong engagement towards the effects on political knowledge. \\"Voters' lack of political information raises important concerns about contemporary democratic practices.\\"Nadeau, Richard., Nevitte, Neil., Gidengil, Elisabeth., and Blais, Andre.\\"Election Campaigns as Information Campaigns: Who Learns What and Does it Matter?\\", Routledge Taylor & Francis Group.

Taking an education class foreground the young Canadians to engage on an array of important public issues.Jennings, M. Kent. , and Niemi, Richard G. \\"Generations and Politics: A Panel Study of Young Adults and Their Parents.\\" New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1981. Pg. 39. The identification of political party defines as '\\"the psychological feeling of attachment of a political party.\\" The authors of the Sourcebook made it clear that party identification \\"is to be distinguished from such behavior as party registration for primary elections or voting for candidates of a particular party.\\"MacManus, Susan A. Young Vs. Old: Generational Combat in the 21st Century. Colorado; Oxford: Westview Press, Inc., A Division of HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 1996. P. 67 For instance, in Ontario in 2000 began to educate civic education to inform political backgrounds. Values of young Canadians  Accordingly, Policy Horizons Canada presents today's young people's interest and statistics of priority in regards to their lives. \\"Today's young people continue to place a high value on family and work and do not reject the political system in which they live, nor do they demonstrate a massive lack of interest in politics.\\"[\\"The Values of Youth in Canada.\\" Policy Horizons Canada. 27 Mar 2010. Web. 24 Nov 2011. < http://www.horizons.gc.ca/eng/content/investing-youth>] They add, \\"census research indicates that youths consider education to be of the utmost importance in opening doors for future employment and assisting them to integrate into society.\\" [Ibid.] What are the common values shared between young Canadians? It should be different from the values 10 or 30 or 50 years ago. Why is there a disconnection between youth and today's social institutions? Why do youth values demonstrate a divergence from those of the parents' generation? That is because of \\"the context of increasing globalization, diversity, and urbanization, and major transformations affecting the family and the labour market.\\"[Ibid.] Multiculturalism \\"Community involvement connected to political engagement.\\"[Milan, Anne. \\"Willing to participate: Political engagement of young adults.\\" Statistics Canada. 2005. Web. 28 Oct 2011. P. 4. < www.statcan.gc.ca/kits- trousses/pdf/social/edu04_0155a-eng.pdf>] Particularly, Canadian society is structured based on shared values of family, education, work, the democratic system as well as bilingualism and multiculturalism.[Ibid.] Significantly, young adults have differences in values due to educational differences.[Ibid] In addition to educational differences, the globalization in Canada has had a significant effect as well. Globalization traces with trade and cultural exchanges, which expanded to experience international adaptability and web engines to explore differences.[Ibid.] \\"These trends may potentially have an impact on what is valued by youth, such as bilingualism (and even multilingualism) multiculturalism.\\"[\\"The Values of Youth in Canada.\\" Policy Horizons Canada. 27 Mar 2010. Web. 24 Nov 2011. < http://www.horizons.gc.ca/page.asp?pagenm=2010-0016_02>] Perhaps, immigrants' population presents the possibility of changes in youth values as well. In terms of immigrants' population, Citizenship and Immigration Canada categorizes permanent immigrants in Canada by using statistical tables and charts. \\"Three basic categories of permanent residents, which correspond to major program objectives: reuniting families, contributing to economic development and protecting refugees.[\\"Canada Facts And Figures: Immigration Overview Permanent and Temporary Residents.\\" Citizenship and Immigration Canada. 2010. Web. 20 Oct 2011.< http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/statistics/menu-fact.asp>] Such number of ethnic groups was verified by the statistics of Canada. And age and source areas[Source areas are divided into Africa and the Middle East, Asia and Pacific, South and Central America, United States, Europe and the United Kingdom.] are categorized to permanent young immigrant residents.Statistically, a top rated ethnic group aged from 15 to 24 years was Asian young immigrants, 65,817 and Africa and the Middle East, 33,239 in second.[\\"Canada Facts And Figures: Immigration Overview Permanent and Temporary Residents.\\" Citizenship and Immigration Canada. 2010. Web. 20 Oct 2011. P. 30.] Furthermore, economic immigrants, aged from 15 to 24 years are Asians, the highest, 62,825 among all aged groups from 0 to 65 years of age or more.[Ibid. P. 23.] Based on the statistics of young immigrants explain the value of multiculturalism is prominent in Canada.[Karim, Karim H. \\"Press, Public sphere, and pluralism: multiculturalism debates in Canadian English- language newspapers.\\" Canadian Ethnic Studies Journal. 2008. Web. 25 Nov. 2011. ] \\"Since urbanization and ethnic diversification in Canadian society result in exposure to different cultures, they many also affect youth values.\\" The result of multiethnic immigrants centralizes multicultural society. Status and socialization \\"Nearly 7 in 10 university-educated young adults participate in non-voting political behaviour.\\"[Milan, Anne. \\"Willing to participate: Political engagement of young adults.\\" Statistics Canada. 2005. Web. 28 Oct 2011. P. 4. < www.statcan.gc.ca/kits- trousses/pdf/social/edu04_0155a-eng.pdf>] The other profile of youth value is constructed by status and socialization. As young generation socializes most of the time, it gradually constructs a self-identity.[Ibid.] Policy Horizons Canada states \\"the values of 14 to 19 year old, has formulated a theory that values are first structured at the beginning of adolescence, when there is an initial distancing from the family home, then a second period where the development of values is affected by educational success.\\"[Ibid.] Gradually, self-identity shapes in transition to adulthood.[Clark, Warren. \\"Canadian Social Trends.\\" Statistics Canada. 02 Jan 2009. Web. 24 Nov 2011. ] In terms of adulthood, young adults' value shift based on experience, a discrepancy between their values and those of society's institutions.[\\"The Values of Youth in Canada.\\" Policy Horizons Canada. 27 Mar 2010. Web. 24 Nov 2011. < http://www.horizons.gc.ca/page.asp?pagenm=2010-0016_02>] Today's young adults are incentives for social and economic factors. CLC President Ken Geogetti was commenting in regards to the latest release from Statistics Canada of its Labour Force Survey for September 2011 that \\"Too many of our young workers are unemployed, too many of them are stuck in part-time jobs and Ottawa should be paying particular attention to them.\\" [\\"Younger workers being left behind: CLC President comments on job numbers for September 2011.\\" Canadian Labour Congress. 07 Oct 2011. Web. 25 Nov 2011. ] Because there were 1,334,200 unemployed Canadians in September and the unemployment rate was 7.1%. While the labour market created a significant number of jobs in September, the unemployment rate among workers aged 15 to 24 was 14.0%, and 48.2% of young workers are employed only part-time.\\"[\\"Latest Release from the Labour Force Survey.\\" Statics Canada. 04 Nov 2011. Web. 25 Nov 2011. ] As Frank Graves, reporter of Ekos Politics adds, \\"We have already seen a run-up in the stock market. Growth may come back later next year, while unemployment is likely to continue getting worse for some time after that.\\"[\\"Liberals Retain Narrow National Lead-June 18, 2009.\\" Ekos Politics. 18 Jun 2009. Web. 25 Nov 2011. ] The factual information about economic status persists young adults to consider lower unemployment rates than voting. Personal reasons come first than voting as Gloria Galloway from The Globe And Mail comments, \\"But many of the respondents also cited personal circumstances. They were too busy, they said, with work, school or family.\\" [\\"Abysmal youth vote prompts call for a remedial strategy.\\" The Globe and Mail. 25 Nov 2011. Web. 25 Nov. 2011. ] Respondents from age 22 to 29 with household income of under $20,000 showed less voting behaviour than did those with household income of $60,000 or more. Results show that young voters hold a different set of priorities than their older cohorts.[Turcotte, Andre. \\"What Do You Mean I Can't Have a Say?

And the statistics of number of immigrants prove that social differences affect young voter declines. It also demonstrates the impact of differences of social class, gender and educational experiences in shaping young people's political orientations and knowledge.[Fahmy, Eldin. Young Citizens: Young People's Involvement in Politics and Decision Making. Hampshire; Burlington: Ashgate, 2006. P. 136.] Political agenda-settings in Canadian newspapers Based on the agenda-setting writing, Robert Hackett, \\"The News Media and Civic Equality: Watch dogs Mad dogs or Lap Dogs: Democratic Equality: What went wrong?\\" explains the media's agenda-setting role is a by-product of our collective dependence on mass media for information beyond our direct experience.[Hackett, Robert. \\"The News Media and Civic Equality: Watch dogs Mad dogs or Lap Dogs: Democratic Equality: What went wrong?\\" Ed. Broadbent, J. Edward,. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001] In other words, political agenda setting in newspaper proposes a specific media's ideology, and characteristics of agenda settings. For that reason, it is prominent to examining a newspaper by understanding the idea of ritual communication that James Carey argues.[Carey, James. \\"A Cultural Approach to Communication: Communication as Culture.\\" New York: Routledge, 2009.] The idea of ritual communication refers \\"the transmission of signals or messages over distance for the purpose of control.\\"[Ibid.P.12] He suggests that communication explicitly demonstrates culture. That is, the key role of political agenda-setting proposes that projection of community centralizes the role of culture and a ritual view of communication.[Ibid] The problems of political agenda-settings in newspaper In the original Chapel Hill study and many of the studies that have followed, both the media agenda and the public agenda consisted of a set of objects, public issues.[McCombs, Maxwell E., and Shaw, Donald L. \\"The Evolution of Agenda-Setting Research: Twenty-Five Years in the Marketplace of Ideas.\\" Journal of Communication. 1993. Pg.58-67.] However, as Stephen P. Nicholson mentions in Voting The Agenda that McCombs and Shaw (1972)[Nicholson, Stephen P. Voting The Agenda: Candidates, Elections, And Ballot Propositions. Princeton; Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2005. P.17.] were the first to examine the agenda-setting effect of media on public sphere. Nicholson noted that McCombs and Shaw examined the 1968 US presidential campaign as their setting, and as a result, the authors found that the mass media, as measured by content analysis of media coverage, had a substantial impact on the public's agenda. Nicholson continually demonstrates examples of Lyengar and Kinder (1987),[Ibid.] drawing on both experimental and quasi-experimental designs, and also found that media coverage of issues had a significant agenda-setting effect. In what terms are political agenda settings affecting the public through the Canadian newspapers? In the guise of contributing to political agenda settings, the newspapers conduct positive and negative arguments of specific national objects, such as politics, to create specific newspaper advocates. \\"Newspapers everywhere were now engaged in the hunt for popularity. Contemporaries noted the declining importance of the editorial page in the typical newspaper.\\"[Rutherford, Paul. A Victorian Authority: The Daily Press in Late Nineteenth-Century Canada. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1982. P. 71-72.] For instance, \\"most major newspapers endorsed the Conservatives, and none solely endorsed the Liberals or Greens. However Canada's highest circulated newspaper, the Toronto Star, advised to vote against the Conservatives.\\" Then it problematizes the range of newspapers covering stories. Canada newspapers coverage on election * The Star's Coverage on election based on their values The core vision of Toronto Star aims to engage \\"in the full and frank dissemination of news and opinion, and to do so working within the highest standards of journalistic integrity. In reporting news and opinion, the Star seeks to inform the public of the significant and interesting events of the day, with particular emphasis on politics and public affairs.\\" which the values established by Joseph E. Atkinson, according to Toronto Star Statement of Principles.[\\"Toronto Star Statement of Principles.\\" The Star. 13 Apr 2011. Web. 25 Nov 2011. ] In addition, Joseph E. Atkinson comments that the principles of The Star are: \\"A strong and united Canada, civic engagement, individual and civil liberties, a necessary role for effective government and the rights of working people.\\" [Ibid.] Atkinson's principles emerge as critical of liberal endorsement in the Canadian context. For instance, The Star paper \\"usually endorses the Liberal Party federally. The Star was the only major daily to do so in the 2006 and the 2008 federal elections while many of the other major papers endorsed the Conservatives. The Star endorsed the social democratic New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Ed Broadbent in 1979 and Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield in 1972. The paper endorsed the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario in many of the provincial elections from the 1940s to the 1980s, and endorsed strategic voting to defeat Mike Harris in 1999.\\"[Ibid.] The Star traced the role of speaking civil rights of working people and individuals by endorsing the NDP for the 2011 federal election. The Star states, \\"The platform the NDP offers voters is ambitious and puts people first. It focuses on seniors, health care and the environment…The NDP has never felt the discipline of power at the national level, and it shows.\\" The Star criticized the Liberal Party's campaign under Michael Ignatieff has developed took everyone by surprise, which it was the biggest disappointment ever. Indeed, The Star concludes with \\"voters who believe Canada should aspire to something greater than the crabbed, narrow vision offered by the Harper Conservatives should look to Jack Layton and the New Democrats on Monday.\\"[Ibid.] Results show that Jack Layton was covered much more positively than Conservative and Liberal. The findings also show that respondents linked in the hunt for popularity. * Reflection of election based on The Globe's ideology principles A discourse of The Globe and Mail focuses exclusively on voice of the High Class elites agenda issues such as \\"the Bay Street financial community of Toronto and the intellectuals of university and government institutions.\\" The Globe prevails the range of offerings to attract elites, well educated, and comfortably well-off high- income audience, whom numbered among the nation's agenda setters.[Hayes, David. Power and Influence. Toronto: Key Porter Books, 1992.] The Globe endorses Stephen Harper's Conservative administration since 2008 federal election and 2011 federal elections. The Globe and Mail viewed \\"Mr. Harper has governed moderately and competently for nearly three years. He has not taken the country in dangerous new directions or significantly eroded the capacity of the government to act, when necessary, in the public interest.\\" Globe also adds \\"Indeed, the most important characteristic Mr. Harper has shown over 33 months in office is a capacity to grow. There is no reason to think he won't continue along the same trajectory if re-elected — a good thing, too, since there is much more for him to learn.\\"[\\"Harper is growing into the job.\\" The Globe and Mail. 31 Mar 2009. Web. 25 Nov 2011. ] The basis of right wing editorial by The Globe, they praises opinion makers support Conservatives' ambitious efforts to cover their campaigns on newspapers. Inequitable values between young Canadians and Canadian newspapers The corresponding of ideology in the Canadian newspapers and young Canadians are not relevantly sharing equal beliefs or information in terms of democracy society. In at least two aspects, the Canadian newspapers obstacle in their duty to foster Young Canadians of voting act: first, the numbers of young Canadian newspaper readerships are very low.[Coleno, Jean. \\"Context and Ideology in the Canadian Media.\\" Friends of Canadian Broadcasting. 31 Mar 2003. Web. 25 Nov 2011. < http://www.friends.ca/pub/190>] Marshall McLuhan said, \\"People don't actually read newspapers.\\"[Attributed to Marshall McLuhan in The Oxford Dictionary of 20th Century Quotations.

The issue of not reading daily newspaper has strong relations to less engaged to act of voting. \\"The newspaper is the direct result of a national campaign by publishers, known as \\"Newspapers in Education\\" (NIE) according to Nola Kortner Aiex.[Aiex, Nola Kortner. \\"Using Newspapers as Effective Teaching Tools.

Second, the newspapers allow political debate to be monopolized by ideologues who adhere dogmatically to their respective political catechisms. As Robert A. Hackett argues the notions like propaganda and indoctrination are implied to manipulate and persuade in news media.[Hackett, Robert. The News Media and Civic Equality: Watch dogs Mad dogs or Lap Dogs: Democratic Equality: What went wrong? Ed. Broadbent, J. Edward,. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001. P.199.] Based on the evidence of The Star and Globe political agenda-settings presented, it would be premature to talk of a crisis of representing election campaign. \\"We cover the campaigns more than the election. We cover the narrative of the day-to-day event. We cover the news. The problem is there isn't actually whole a lot of news in the campaign.\\" declared Andre Coyne, national editor, MacLean's magazine who discussed newspaper coverage of the election campaign including narrative- setting, agendas, bias, and spin on September 27th 2011 at University of Toronto, St.Michael's College class with Dr. Gerald Caplan, political columnist at Globe and Mail.[Caplan, Gerald., and Coyne, Andre. Class Lecture. \\"Newspaper coverage of the election campaign: narrative-setting, agendas, bias, spin.\\" 03 Oct 2011.] They also argued that a lot of coverage unfortunately is aimed at political gentlemen. Moreover, they talked about how well newspapers are focusing the issues of election campaigns.[Ibid.] The fact is that young Canadians tend to be committed to their own structured democracy which differs from that of the parent generations. \\"The differences can mainly be seen in the ways that today's youth engage in politics, which is primarily through non-electoral activities.\\"[ \\"The Values of Youth in Canada.\\" Policy Horizons Canada. 27 Mar 2010. Web. 24 Nov 2011. < http://www.horizons.gc.ca/page.asp?pagenm=2010-0016_02>] Conceptual links between young Canadian values and Canadian newspapers are not contributed to social cohesion, depending on the degree of difference that separates groups in their fundamental values by perceiving Hackett's \\"The News Media and Civic Equality: Watch Dogs, Mad Dogs, or Lap Dogs? In so doing, the media are reinforcing the political status quo by constraining oppositional mobilization, an impact consistent with the lap dog view.[Hackett, Robert.

History Pork has been a Danish favourite for centuries but it was after the Industrial Revolution in the 1860s when wood-fired ovens were introduced for use in the home that, in addition to sausages and hams, roast pork became a popular dish. From the beginning, joints were always cooked together with the rind in order to provide crackling. Ever since, this has remained a prerequisite for the dish.\\"La cuisine danoise\\" , Ambassade du Danemark Luxembourg. Retrieved 15 December 2011. Traditional recipe The traditional method of preparation is to roast a joint of pork from the breast or neck without removing the rind. So as to obtain crispy crackling, a sharp knife should be used to cut the skin through to the meat in narrow strips. The skin is rubbed with salt, pepper is added, while bay leaves and optionally cloves are inserted into the cuts. The joint is then roasted in a hot oven. The dish is accompanied by both boiled potatoes and caramelized potatoes (brunede kartofler). These are specially prepared by melting sugar in a frying pan over strong heat, adding a clump of butter, and allowing a portion of small round peeled potatoes (available in cans) to bathe in the mixture until they become richly browned or caramelized. Red cabbage (rødkål), which can be bought in a jar or a can, is always included too. If the cabbage is prepared from scratch, sliced apples are often added.\\"Danish Christmas dinner\\", Wonderful Denmark. Retrieved 13 December 2011.

Bacteria can survive under diverse environmental conditions and in order to overcome these adverse and changing conditions, bacteria must sense the changes and mount appropriate responses in gene expression and protein activity. The stress response in bacteria involves a complex network of elements that acts against the external stimulus.

Introduced in the late-1960s, the zero- zero capable Mk.9 has been installed in several European combat aircraft types and was also used in experimental aircraft. History The Mk.9 seat is considered by the manufacturer as the culmination of their earlier designs. It features only one firing handle (the face blind handle being deleted) and a new explosive gas system to operate canopy jettison, harness retraction and main gun firing, dispensing with previous mechanical systems of rods or cables.Martin-Baker Mk.9 fact sheets www.martin-baker.com Retrieved: 15 December 2011Philpott 1989. p. 93. Operation sequence Operating the seat pan firing handle initiates aircraft canopy jettison, as the canopy clears an interlock is removed which allows the main gun located at the rear of the seat to fire, the main gun is a telescopic tube with two explosive charges that fire in sequence. As the seat moves up its guide rails an emergency oxygen supply is activated and personal equipment tubing and communication leads are automatically disconnected, leg restraints also operate. As the seat moves further up and out of the aircraft the rocket pack is fired by a lanyard attached to the cockpit floor. A steel rod, known as the drogue gun, is fired and extracts two small parachutes to stabilise the seat's descent path. A barostatic mechanism prevents the main parachute from opening above an altitude of 16,000 ft (5,000 m) A time delay mechanism operates the main parachute below this altitude in conjunction with another device to prevent the parachute opening at high speed. The seat then separates from the occupant for a normal parachute descent, a manual separation handle and ripcord is provided should the automatic system fail.

The original route runs northward from just west of Union Station in downtown Toronto, ending just south of North Bay. A short portion between Allendale in Barrie and Longford outside Orillia was lifted in 1996, and the southern section sold off in parts to Metrolinx. Metrolinx operates the southern section as their Barrie line, while CN continues to operate the northern section from Longford to North Bay. The severed northern section was never renamed, despite it no longer running through its namesake town. Access to Toronto is currently via the Bala Subdivision at Washago Junction, a short distance north of the remaining section's southern terminus, which is now used as a spur serving industries. The line was originally the Northern Railway of Canada, the first railway to open for commercial business in what was then Upper Canada. It reached Allendale in 1853 and then began construction northwest towards Collingwood and beyond to Meaford. After merging with their competitor, the Hamilton and Northwestern Railway, they built a joint line running northeast out of Barrie toward Orillia, and then on to meet the Canadian Pacific Railway transcontinental lines in North Bay. The Northern was purchased by the Grand Trunk Railway in 1888, whose bankruptcy in 1918 led to the line becoming part of the newly-formed CNR in 1923. The northeastern branch became part of the Newmarket Subdivision, with the original line becoming the Meaford Subdivision, which CN sold off in 1998 to the municipalities of Barrie and Collingwood to become the Barrie-Collingwood Railway. CNR continued use of both lines in spite of now having several routes northward, and did not begin closing portions (Collingwood to Meaford) until the 1980s. The line was used by Via Rail's transcontinental The Canadian, running north from Toronto to Washago at the north end of Lake Couchiching where it switched to the Bala Sub and proceeded to Sudbury. From 1976, the ONR operated the Northlander passenger train service along this line between Toronto and North Bay, switching onto their own lines in North Bay to continue on to Cochrane. \\"C.N.Rys. Newmarket Subdivision\\" 27 January 2018. Retrieved on 2 December 2018. Beginning in 1982, the line also began to be used by GO Transit for service from Toronto to Barrie. In 1996, the rails between Barrie and Longford (just south of Washago Junction) were removed, thus ending service to Orillia, severing the line. The Canadian then used the line as far as Snyder Junction with the York Sub just north of the Toronto city limits, and then uses the York Sub to access the Bala Sub and on to Sudbury. The Northlander instead switched to the Bala Sub for its entire run. In 1996, CN also applied to abandon the entire section from York Sub to Barrie. This section was then purchased by the Ontario government for use by GO Transit. CN retained the section from the York Sub to Union Station, but eventually sold off that section to the newly formed Metrolinx in 2009. This has allowed increased commuter traffic on the line, including 15 minute service and weekend trains. The northern portion of the original Newmarket Sub between Washago Junction and North Bay is still owned and operated by CN, and is exclusively used for freight traffic travelling between Toronto (from the Bala Sub) and North Bay. \\"CN Eastern Division Great Lakes\\", Canadian National Railways 1 January 2005.

There are records of Sternarchorhynchus from the Oyapock on the French Guiana–Brazil border, but their validity and taxonomic position is unclear. Most species have relatively small ranges, but a few are more widespread. S. mormyrus of the Amazon and Orinoco basins is the only that occurs in more than one major river system. The habitat varies depending on species, but they require well-oxygenated waters. They have been recorded in whitewater (like the Amazon River), blackwater (like Tefé River) and clearwater (like the Xingu River). Some species have been found in small streams, less than deep, while others inhabit the main stream of major rivers. S. mesensis is known from both above-ground and below-ground habitats, but lacks the cavefish adaptions seen in the only true cave knifefish, Eigenmannia vicentespelaea. Some change habitat with age; adult S. cramptoni and S. mormyrus live in main river channels, but their young are found near the river shore in várzea. Nine species, all with small ranges in Brazil and most restricted to fast-flowing waters including rapids, are considered threatened by Brazil's Ministry of the Environment.ICMBio (Ministry of the Environment, Brazil): Portaria MMA nº 445, de 17 de dezembro de 2014.

The current conservation status of S. gnomus is unclear, as the only known locality in Venezuela's lower Caroní basin has been flooded by a dam. Appearance and behavior They have a relatively long, downwards-pointed and tube-like snout. The adult males of some species have distinct teeth on the outside of the lower jaw, likely used in confrontations with other males. The largest species reach up to in total length, but most are less than half that size and the smallest only reach about . Several species are only known from museum specimens and consequently their living colors are unknown. Where known, the species are generally medium to dark brownish or grayish. They are often darker on the upper part than the lower and some have a pale line on the top of the head, but otherwise they are quite uniformly colored without conspicuous patters. However, at least one species, S. cramptoni, is overall whitish-pink, similar to some other knifefish like Compsaraia and Orthosternarchus that inhabit deep, dark rivers.

History is the study of the past using written records. Anything prior to the first written accounts of history is prehistoric, including earlier technologies. About 2.5 million years before writing was developed, technology began with the earliest hominids who used stone tools, which they may have used to start fires, hunt, and bury their dead. There are several factors that made the evolution of prehistoric technology possible or necessary. One of the key factors is behavioral modernity of the highly developed brain of Homo sapiens capable of abstract reasoning, language, introspection, and problem solving. The advent of agriculture resulted in lifestyle changes from nomadic lifestyles to ones lived in homes, with domesticated animals, and land farmed using more varied and sophisticated tools. Art, architecture, music and religion evolved over the course of the prehistoric periods.  Old World   Stone Age  The Stone Age is a broad prehistoric period during which stone was widely used in the manufacture of implements with a sharp edge, a point, or a percussion surface. The period lasted roughly 2.5 million years, from the time of early hominids to Homo sapiens in the later Pleistocene era, and largely ended between 6000 and 2000 BCE with the advent of metalworking. The Stone Age lifestyle was that of hunter-gatherers who traveled to hunt game and gather wild plants, with minimal changes in technology. As the last glacial period of the current ice age neared its end (about 12,500 years ago), large animals like the mammoth and bison antiquus became extinct and the climate changed. Humans adapted by maximizing the resources in local environments, gathering and eating a wider range of wild plants and hunting or catching smaller game. Domestication of plants and animals with early stages in the Old World (Afro- Eurasia) Mesolithic and New World (Americas) Archaic periods led to significant changes and reliance on agriculture in the Old World Neolithic and New World Formative stage. The agricultural life led to more settled existences and significant technological advancements.Cassells, E. Steve. (1997). The Archaeology of Colorado, Revised Edition. Boulder, Colorado: Johnson Books. pp. 6-14. . Although Paleolithic cultures left no written records, the shift from nomadic life to settlement and agriculture can be inferred from a range of archaeological evidence. Such evidence includes ancient tools, cave paintings, and other prehistoric art, such as the Venus of Willendorf. Human remains also provide direct evidence, both through the examination of bones, and the study of mummies. Though concrete evidence is limited, scientists and historians have been able to form significant inferences about the lifestyle and culture of various prehistoric peoples, and the role technology played in their lives. = Lower Paleolithic = The Lower Paleolithic period was the earliest subdivision of the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age. It spans the time from around 2.5 million years ago when the first evidence of craft and use of stone tools by hominids appears in the current archaeological record, until around 300,000 years ago, spanning the Oldowan (\\"mode 1\\") and Acheulean (\\"mode 2\\") lithic technology. Early human (hominid) used stone tool technology, such as a hand axe that was similar to that used by primates, which are found to have intelligence levels of modern children aged 3 to 5 years.

Behavioral modernity is a set of traits that distinguish Homo sapiens from extinct hominid lineages. Homo sapiens reached full behavior modernity around 50,000 years ago due to a highly developed brain capable of abstract reasoning, language, introspection, and problem solving. Aurignacian tools, such as stone bladed tools, tools made of antlers, and tools made of bones were created during this period. People began creating clothing.

Cultural aspects emerged, such as art of the Upper Paleolithic period, which included cave painting, sculpture such as the Venus figurines, carvings and engravings of bone and ivory. The most common subject matter was large animals that were hunted by the people of the time. The Cave of Altamira and Paleolithic Cave Art of Northern Spain and Côa Valley Paleolithic Art are examples of such artwork. Musical instruments such as flutes emerged during this period. = Mesolithic period = The Mesolithic period was a transitional era between the Paleolithic hunter-gatherers, beginning with the Holocene warm period around 11,660 BP and ending with the Neolithic introduction of farming, the date of which varied in each geographical region. Adaptation was required during this period due to climate changes that affected environment and the types of available food. Small stone tools called microliths, including small bladelets and microburins, emerged during this period.Ian Shaw, Robert Jameson. (2002). A Dictionary of Archaeology. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. pp. 394, 396. . For instance, spears or arrows were found at the earliest known Mesolithic battle site at Cemetery 117 in the Sudan.Dawn of Ancient Warfare.

Ancient European Bows, The Traditional Bowyers Bible Volume 2. The Lyons Press. pp. 87-88. . These microliths point to the use of projectile technology since they are widely assumed to have formed the tips and barbs of arrows. This is demonstrated by mesolithic assemblages found in southwest Germany, which revealed two types of projectiles used: arrows with transverse, trapezoidal stone tips and large barbed antler \\"harpoons\\". These implements indicate the nature of human adaptation to the environment during the period, describing the Mesolithic societies as hunter-gatherers. = Neolithic Revolution = The Neolithic Revolution was the first agricultural revolution, representing a transition from hunting and gathering nomadic life to an agriculture existence. It evolved independently in six separate locations worldwide circa 10,000–7,000 years BP (8,000–5,000 BC). The earliest known evidence exists in the tropical and subtropical areas of southwestern/southern Asia, northern/central Africa and Central America. There are some key defining characteristics. The introduction of agriculture resulted in a shift from nomadic to more sedentary lifestyles,Ian Shaw, Robert Jameson. (2002). A Dictionary of Archaeology. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. pp. 422-423. . and the use of agricultural tools such as the plough, digging stick and hoe made agricultural labor more efficient. Animals were domesticated, including dogs. Another defining characteristic of the period was the emergence of pottery, and, in the late Neolithic period, the wheel was introduced for making pottery.Ian Shaw, Robert Jameson. (2002). A Dictionary of Archaeology. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. p. 125. . Neolithic architecture included houses and villages built of mud-brick and wattle and daub and the construction of storage facilities, tombs and monuments.Ian Shaw, Robert Jameson. (2002).

University of Texas Press. p. 102. .  Bronze Age  A late Bronze Age sword or dagger blade. The Stone Age developed into the Bronze Age after the Neolithic Revolution. The Neolithic Revolution involved radical changes in agricultural technology which included development of agriculture, animal domestication, and the adoption of permanent settlements. The Bronze Age is characterised by metal smelting of copper and its alloy bronze, an alloy of tin and copper, to create implements and weapons. Polished stone tools continued to be used due to their abundance compared with the less common metals (especially tin). This technological trend apparently began in the Fertile Crescent, and spread outward.  Iron Age  An axehead made of iron, dating from Swedish Iron Age. The Iron Age involved the adoption of iron or steel smelting technology, either by casting or forging. Iron replaced bronze,The Junior Encyclopædia Britannica: A reference library of general knowledge. (1897). Chicago: E.G.

The Coming of the Age of Iron (New Haven, 1980). The best tools and weapons were made from steel.Spoerl, Joseph S. A Brief History of Iron and Steel Production. . Saint Anselm College. Retrieved December 20, 2011. Other societal changes often accompanied the introduction of iron, including practice changes in art, religion and agriculture. The Iron Age ends with the beginning of the historic periods, generally marked by the development of written language that enabled creation of historic records. The timing of the adoption of iron depended upon \\"the availability of iron ore and the state of knowledge\\". Iron was smelted in Egypt about 6000 B.C. and iron replaced bronze in the Middle East about 1500 B.C. Chinese began casting iron about 5000 B.C. and their methods for casting iron was the precursor to modern steel manufacturing methods. Most of Asia, however, did not adopt production of iron until the historic period. In Europe, iron was introduced about 1100 B.C. and had replaced bronze for creating weapons and tools by 500 B.C. They made iron through the forging smelting process and integrated casting in the Middle Ages. Large hill forts or oppida were built either as a refuge in time of war, or sometimes as permanent settlements. Agricultural practices were made more efficient with more effective and varied iron tools. Iron was extracted from metal ore starting about 2000 B.C. in Africa.  New World  The New World periods began with the crossing of the Paleo-Indians, Athabaskan, Aleuts and Eskimos along the Bering Land Bridge onto the North American continent.Cassells, E. Steve. (1997). The Archaeology of Colorado, Revised Edition. Boulder, Colorado: Johnson Books. p. 13. . The Paleo-Indians were the first people who entered, and subsequently inhabited, the Americas during the final glacial episodes of the late Pleistocene period. Evidence suggests big-game hunters crossed the Bering Strait from Asia into North America over a land and ice bridge (Beringia), that existed between 45,000 BCE – 12,000 BCE,\\"Atlas of the Human Journey-The Genographic Project.\\" National Geographic Society. 1996-2008. following herds of large herbivores far into Alaska.Viegas, Jennifer. \\"First Americans Endured 20,000-Year Layover.\\" Discovery News. In their book, Method and Theory in American Archaeology, Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips defined five cultural stages for the Americas, including the three prehistoric Lithic, Archaic and Formative stages. The historic stages are the Classic and Post-Classic stages.Willey, Gordon R. (1989). Glyn Edmund Daniel and Christopher Chippindale (eds.). The Pastmasters: Eleven Modern Pioneers of Archaeology. New York: Thames & Hudson. . OCLC 19750309.  Lithic  The Lithic period occurred from 12,000 to 6,000 years before present and included the Clovis, Folsom and Plano cultures.Cassells, E. Steve. (1997). The Archaeology of Colorado. (revised edition). Boulder: Johnson Books. p. 9. . Clovis culture was considered the first culture to use projectile points to hunt on the North American continent. Since then, a pre- Clovis site was found in Manis, Washington that found use of projectile points to hunt mastodons.Bhanoo, Sindya N. (October 20, 2011). \\"Big-Game Hunt Adds to Evidence of Early North American Settlement.\\" New York Times. Retrieved December 20, 2011.  Archaic  The Archaic period in the Americas was dated from 8,000 to 2,000 years before present. People were hunters of small game, such as deer, antelope and rabbits, and gatherers of wild plants, moving seasonally to hunting and gathering sites. Late in the Archaic period, about 200-500 A.D., corn was introduced into the diet and pottery-making became an occupation for storing and caring food.Kipfer, Barbara Ann. (2000). Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology. New York:Plenum Publisher. p. 341. .  Formative  The Formative stage followed the Archaic period in the Americas and continued until there was contact by European people. Some of the cultures from that period include that of the Ancient Pueblo People, Mississippian culture and Olmec cultures. Cultures of the Formative Stage are supposed to possess the technologies of pottery, weaving, and developed food production. Social organization is supposed to involve permanent towns and villages, as well as the first ceremonial centers.

HHCS is a member of Edvance Christian School Association History In January 1957, a group of parents who felt the need for Christian education, came together to begin plans for their vision of a Christian school. In October 1960 the school became incorporated as Georgetown District Christian School and gradually enough money was accumulated to buy to property which is 8 acres on which the school now stands. The property is worth about $12,713.00. The school became a reality in 1965, when it was dedicated for service. Psalm 111: 10, was chosen for the cornerstone: \\"For reverence of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\\" Three staff members welcomed ninety-nine students to three classrooms that September morning. The cost of building the school was $48,013.06. The cost of the school supplies and furniture, flag, and flag pole was altogether $4,551.11. Since that time, the school building has been enlarged four times in order to accommodate the increasing number of students coming from Christian homes in the community. A pre-school for four-year-olds was started in 1997. In the fall of 2008, a process of re-branding was initiated by the board and development committee, with the goal in mind to make sure that the school's \\"brand\\" was relevant and \\"current\\" with respect to their vision for excellence and growth. In the spring of 2009, a new name and logo were presented and approved by the school membership. The school's name is officially change in September 2009 from Georgetown District Christian School, to Halton Hills Christian School, a name more reflective of the community where the school is located and the area that it services. Halton Hills Christian School continues to serve Christian families from a large geographical area. Academics Students learn a variety of subjects. The subjects the school offers are art, bible, French, language arts, spelling, mathematics, social sciences, music, and physical education. The school also meets and exceeds the provincial requirements for education. New this year, HHCS is running an enrichment program called \\"CEIADA.\\" CEIADA stands for Christian Education in a Digital Age. In this program, students from various schools in the lower Ontario area take part in projects such as making their own Autobiography and posting it on YouTube, making a full Wikipedia article on their school, and making podcasts every other week that will be posted on iTunes. Co-Curricular Choir- Students from Grade 1 to 3 participate weekly in Primary Choir as do Grade 4 to 6 students in Jr. Choir. Grade 6 also learns chimes. Grade 4 and 5 learn to play the recorders. Choirs also perform for local churches and nursing homes on ongoing basis during the year. Science Fair– Every other year, students in Grade 1-8 participate in a school wide science fair. Several projects from Grade 7 & 8 are selected to go on and complete at the Provincial level. French– French language program begins in Grade 1 and continues to Grade 8. Students are given opportunity to learn to speak, write and read our second national language. Band– All students in Grade 7 and 8 participate in Band class and take instrumental music. The band practices 2 times week to prepare musical pieces for chapels, concerts, church services and community events. Chapels– Are held once a month. Activities range from class presentations, to having local pastors or other speakers from Christian organizations to speak. These times are the corporate worship times for the staff and students. Parents are also welcome to join. Electives– On a bi-annual basis, students from grade 1-6 have opportunity to explore a leisure activity for 4 winter afternoons. Some examples are: pottery, horseback riding, writing and publishing. Students in Grades 7&8 get to go outside of school to act as interns in different work places for 6 half days. Community Service– Each grade participates in different ways to help out the community of Halton Hills every year. The school, participate in food drive for the local food bank, collect items for Operation Christmas Child, host a toy drive during Christmas and/or hats/mittens drive during the winter every year. Intergrade Connection– Younger grade students are paired up with older grade students for various classroom activities ranging from reading buddies to making crafts together to helping Preschoolers and Kindergarten students with their hats, mittens, and coats before they go home or out to play. Musicals/Dramas– Each year the students and staff host a major musical production to celebrate a Christian holiday. All students from Pre-school to Grade 8 participate. Harmony PreSchool Harmony Preschool is affiliated with Halton Hills Christian School. The staff and students come from many different Christian denominations and with the support of their surrounding Christian community. Arrowsmith Following the methods developed by Barbara Arrowsmith Young of Toronto, they have started a cognitive abilities class. The Arrowsmith program is a different approach to dealing with students with learning disabilities. Previously, students were taught strategies to compensate for their learning disabilities and the classroom environment was modified to accommodate these students and their needs. The Arrowsmith program is only in certain private schools across Canada and the United States. The Arrowsmith_Program is based on the theory of neuroplasticity. It is now a recognized fact that the brain is pliable and elastic, not fixed as we used to believe. Therefore, it is now possible to physically change the brain in response to stimuli and develop new neural pathways. The exercises created by Barbara Arrowsmith Young over the past 25 years now make it possible for the brains of children with certain learning dysfunctions to be strengthened to the point of average or above-average functionality. HHCS has students coming and going out of the Arrowsmith room for 50%, 62%, or 74% of the school day, depending on their individual program. To assist them, they have 2 experienced teachers, trained in the Arrowsmith methodology, and 1 teaching assistant to aid in the classroom activities. Students work on a variety of 11 different cognitive exercises. All students complete pen and paper work, some students work on computers, and some students use MP3 players to complete auditory work. Students are required to do 70 to 100 minutes of homework, 6 times a week. The exercises work the brain as if it is a muscle. The new promise is that, as the exercises change the brain’s abilities, children begin to learn at the natural rate of their peers; they no longer require remedial support, program modification, or other forms of compensation. Renovation Halton Hills Christian School renovated their school in 2013. The construction is now complete, and the school has been expanded. The school was 6 weeks ahead of the estimated completion time.

Like all non-profit organizations, NPJs depend on private donations or foundation grants to pay for operational expenses. This branch of journalism is not to be confused with other types of nonprofit news media organizations in the non-investigative field. Although they have existed for decades, the proliferation of the World Wide Web and internet have helped create a booming industry of non-profit investigative centers. Their existence has sparked widespread debate over their ability to remain neutral, especially when their revenue depends on ideologically-skewed funding organizations or donors. In times of a large decline in newspaper revenue and crises in the newspaper industries, other scholars have also argued whether this is, in fact, a sustainable initiative. Still others have claimed their support for philanthrojournalism, and its ability to maintain high quality, and be less constrained by advertisers. Though there is limited research on philanthrojournalistic organizations, a few studies shed some light on their advantages and limitations. Organizations with a national-level scope are more identifiable, as they compare to mainstream commercial news organizations. According to journalism.org, these organizations fall into two main categories: group sites, part of formal families organized by a single funder and associated sites, those that share content but operate independently.  Historical Background  Although non-profit journalism dates back to the start of the Associated Press in 1846, the first group dedicated to investigative journalism was the Center for Investigative Reporting (CIR), which formed in 1977. Moreover, journalist Charles Lewis founded the Center for Public Integrity in 1989. Since then, many other non-profits have proliferated firstly in the United States, and then, elsewhere in the world. Due to their alternative funding models, many of these organizations have contributed deeply to investigative journalism. For example, ProPublica, a non-profit investigative center, won two Pulitzer prizes over the course of its work. The number of nonprofit investigative reporting centers has escalated from only three in the late 1980s to over 40 today, with centers originating in countries such as Romania, the Philippines, Jordan, and South Africa. Four global conferences on investigative journalism since 2000 have attracted some 2,000 journalists from more than 50 countries. There have been many initiatives to increase transparency and accountability in funding. For example, the Institute for Nonprofit News (INN), formed in 2009, is a network of investigative non-for-profit centers in which membership requires being a registered charity with transparent funding. The proliferation of investigative centers ranges from state-oriented initiatives to local grassroots-based initiatives. The state or region-based model tends to be more sustainable, as it is usually funded by foundations in the same area. State- oriented centers such as the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism and New England Center for Investigative Reporting are garnering increasing success. They are also, arguably, viable alternatives to the nationwide news outlets. Likewise, there are an increasing number of local-level investigative centers, in places such as Baltimore and Texas, making their narrow-focus even more relatable to local readers.  Theoretical Background  Critique of Philanthrojournalism David Westphal (2009) in his Philanthropic Foundations: growing funders of the news has expressed support for philanthrojournalism, but not without skepticism. He notes that many of the news organizations report based on their funder’s interest areas. For example, in Westphal’s analysis of the Kaiser Family Foundation’s support for health- news initiatives, funders were concerned with having less control over the health information they were funding, as it was channeled through other mediators. Meanwhile, Robert McChesney and John Nichols (2010) are more concerned with the sustainability of such initiatives and whether the foundation-funding model will be able to survive with \\"less than one tenth the annual newsroom budget of…the New York Times\\". Moreover, Robert Arnove and Nadine Pinede (2007) undertook a study on the \\"big three\\" US-based foundations – Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie – and revealed that they play the role of unofficial planning agencies, have a very US-centric model, and utilize a very \\"elitist, technocratic approach to social change.\\" Likewise, Sean Stannard- Stockton, claims that in addition to maintaining the status quo, many foundations use “hard power” to “shape events by providing or withdrawing grants” thereby creating a dependence by non-profit organizations. Therefore, as a whole, most critics of non-profit journalism concur that their dependence on donors leads them to maintaining elites powers of control. Bob Feldman (2007) adds that the processes used to gain such finding are modeled in “safe, legalistic, bureaucratic activities and mild reformism” and creates a “climate of secrecy” as the foundations domesticate their agendas. Support for Philanthrojournalism Harry Browne, (2010) acknowledges some of the advantages of philanthrojournalism. For example, he notes, that the removal of direct commercial pressures could allow reporters \\"more time to work on a story, by freeing them to pursue less-popular topics and by reducing the likelihood of pressure from an owner or advertiser.\\" Browne also notes that if philanthrojournalism seeks to remain transparent by constantly informing the public about its ultimate source of subsidy and the work of its donors, and if it also seeks to do so in a democratic manner, philanthrojournalism could become more accountable. Moreover, Journalism.org has noted that the dependence of these centers on donors leads to focusing great attention to quality. Consequently, many organizations such as ProPublica and the Texas Tribune are able to have multiple donors and raise millions of dollars due to the many journalism awards they have received. Rebecca Nee (2011), meanwhile, argues that philanthrojournalism could become an alternative to mainstream media. Nee emphasizes the decreasing role of mainstream news media, as she cites the 2010 State of the News Media report, which claimed that circulation had dropped by one quarter since the 21st century. Nee also adds that the digital revolution has fuelled an increasing number of readers to opt for online newspaper. Therefore, by being digital-grown, many non-profit investigative centers not only need decreased sources of revenue, but also manage to thrive in their area of digital expertise. NPJ centers are slightly in the lead over mainstream media in terms of digital innovation, as they can focus on their resources on doing so. Moreover, Nee argues that the narrow investigative scope of NPJ centers allows them to not waste their resources on a daily journalism agenda.  Funding  Funding has been one of the most controversial issues of philanthrojournalism. While dependence on advertising revenue is eliminated, it is replaced with dependence on foundations. As mainstream media is struggling in terms of revenue, NPJ centers are exploring new business models. A recent study at American University, revealed that foundations had contributed to approximately $128 million to community and investigative reporting nonprofits between 2005 and 2009. Between May 2010 and September 2011, the Pew Research Center’s Journalism Project implemented a wide-scale study on 46 national-level non-profit investigative organizations created after 2005, and examined their transparency, political bias, number of revenue streams and productivity. The study showed that, within that time period, the news organizations, which have multiple funding sources and are transparent about funding have a more balanced ideological perspective. For example, out of the organizations studied, 56% were ideologically skewed. Likewise, the most ideologically skewed organizations tended to be funded mostly or entirely by one parent organization. More often than not the topics covered on these sites correlated with the political orientation of their donors. For example, while the liberal-oriented American Independent News sites favored discussions of organized labor and the environment, the more conservative Watchdog.org, meanwhile, focused on government policies and their inefficiency and waste. Examples of sites with the most balanced coverage are ProPublica and the Texas Tribune, which are also among the most trafficked in the sample. Therefore, as suggested in the study, while bias and transparency are possible hindrances to the ethicality of NPJ centers, it is greatly reduced when revenue is dependent on multiple donors with diverse ideological orientations. However, these donor-funded centers could also be unsustainable in the long-term. For example, the CCIR relies heavily on individual donations, which average $100 to $200 and make up 30 to 50 percent of its revenue. Nevertheless, the prospects of unsustainability are also greatly reduced with the increase of multiple donors. Many centers, such as the Voice of San Diego, are also utilizing hybrid models of philanthropy and private sector revenue combinations. The Bay Citizen, for example, bases its funds on four sources of revenue. Moreover, the executive director of CCIR, Bilbo Poynter, has argued that a large number of donors could also increase competition and therefore the need for credibility and transparency for both donors and the investigative centers. Many organizations, such as ProPublica, are publishing the salary of their journalists as well as the center sources of revenue on their websites. Thus, an increase in the number of donors, also tends to increase political neutrality, sustainability, transparency and productivity.  Cooperation with Mainstream Media  Many organizations cooperate with mainstream media and even subsidize investigations to use their broad networks for their news stories. Almost all nonprofit media outlets have collaborated with either print and broadcast commercial outlets or public media outlets in their region. In some cases, the centers had formal arrangements with revenue exchanged, whilst in other cases, collaboration was on a story-by-story basis and did not include revenue, but only a sharing of resources and expenses. For example, ProPublica won a 2010 Pulitzer Prize in collaboration with the New York Times for an investigative report on one hospital’s emergency response to treating flood victims of Hurricane Katrina. Many mainstream media outlets also find themselves in need for such collaborations due to their financial struggles.  Advantages of Philanthrojournalism  At a time when the media industry is struggling, philanthrojournalism is providing an alternative business model. Their ability to start anew by being digital-grown helps them be innovative, with the latest digital tools, being free of printing press, and most importantly, to not be dependent on print advertising. NPJ centers also have the ability, unlike commercial news media, to disconnect from the consumerist needs of the market place. Moreover, the narrow focus of the centers on investigative journalism helps them focus on improving quality of such comprehensive reporting. This narrow focus also reflects the original idea of the news industry to act as civic journalism. ProPublica’s Richard Tofel argues that investigative reporting will never become obsolete, as it increasingly competes with declining mainstream media that focuses on daily politics. The dependency on donors can also force NPJ centers to depend on credibility for funding, and therefore improve their standards. For example, three major NPJs, the Center for Public Integrity, ProPublica and the Center for Investigative Reporting are succeeding greatly, winning Pulitzer Prizes, and in return receiving more donor-based funding. According to a study, many reporters felt the nonprofit funding model gives them greater freedom to choose stories based on merit and public impact rather than popularity. Unlike mainstream media, which relies more on business strategies, NPJ centers do not need to show their philanthropic funders an immediate return on investment. They are, therefore, less subjected to agenda-setting commercial pressures than mainstream media. Their non-profit nature also allows them to be exempted from taxes from the federal government. Additionally, many initiatives to increase transparency are proliferating. For example, ProPublica, as well as many other non-profit centers are publishing details of their funding revenues, the salaries of their reporters and the ideological perspectives of their donors. More concrete networks such as the Investigative News Network has forced members to be a registered charity and be transparent in their funding. While critics criticise philanthrojournalism for being unsustainable, they fail to acknowledge the hybrid models many NPJs have adapted to. Many nonprofit centers receive their revenue through a total or partial combination of the following strategies: membership donations, corporate sponsorships or advertising, charging other media for content, providing services such as analyzing and posting date, training students and journalists and creating an endowment. Moreover, unlike mainstream media, which more often than not, continues to utilize print versions, most NPJs are digital-born. They can, therefore, focus all their resources on hiring technicians or reporters with greater expertise in digital media. Many are utilizing social media, which, consequently, is increasingly bringing them closer to younger generations.  Disadvantages of Philanthrojournalism  Non-profit investigative centers are criticised for being unsustainable. Without funding from philanthropists and foundations, it is difficult for investigative reporting to survive, even with diverse sources of revenue. This is because it is expensive and time- consuming, with no guarantee of success. This, therefore, also relates to the prospects of NPJ as being unsustainable. The non-profit composition of such centers also limits the type of revenue sources they can attain. They are also unable to, in theory, be partisan in nature. Likewise, a study conducted by Rebecca Nee (2010) asserts that many nonprofit centers admit to feeling uncomfortable with their current unsustainable funding and thus plan on diversifying their funding sources. Moreover, the dependence on foundations for revenue, can cause an ideological skewing towards the political orientation of their donors. The donors may also have secret propaganda agendas and aim to utilize these news networks for their own spread of knowledge. However, as mentioned earlier, this could be bypassed by increasing the number of donor sources. The centers also have to create a respectable profile to convince foundations, organizations and individuals to donate, which, in return could in increase the quality of reporting.  Impact on the Newspaper Industry  The rise of philanthrojournalism, and the simultaneous decline of mainstream media, suggest it will one day become the dominant model of news media. Another possible outcome is that both forms of media will increasingly cooperate with one another. For example, the Center for Investigative Reporting produces print and broadcast reports under contractual agreements with public and commercial media outlets. Traditional mainstream media continues to struggle with declining advertising revenue. For example, in 2009, mainstream media faced a revenue decline of up to 25-30 percent. Commercial media has faced a huge financial collapse and has therefore been forced to lay off many reporters and the reduce the size or completely shut down its foreign bureaus. Philanthrojournalism, in contrast, is less expansive in its scope, and relies on a more limited source of revenue. NPJ centers often hire experienced journalists who have left their mainstream media careers. A PEW research study in 2010 reveals that while demand for substantive news is high, the commercial press has not been fulfilling its social responsibility role, especially in terms of investigative journalism For example, in Los Angeles news outlets, only 1.9% of a 30-minute newscast was devoted to civic affairs, and 3.3% of Los Angeles Times news reporting was devoted to local government news. Moreover, readers are increasingly choosing internet-based news as a source of information over print news. Non-profit centers, unlike mainstream media, tend to be greater pioneers of civic journalism, as they focus most of their news on civic affairs. However, skeptics such as new-media consultant Merill Brown, claim that NPJ centers continue to play a minute role in comparison to mainstream media, especially those owned by large conglomerates. As even the multibillion-dollar foundations are also suffering from the financial crisis, the sustainability of these organizations is becoming more farfetched. Nevertheless, while non- profit investigative centers may not, for now, compete with mainstream media, they could play an increasing role in the news field, and possibly increase their partnerships with mainstream media.

The Chicano Art Movement represents attempts by Mexican-American artists to establish a unique artistic identity in the United States. Much of the art and the artists creating Chicano Art were heavily influenced by Chicano Movement (El Movimiento) which began in the 1960s. Chicano art was influenced by post- Mexican Revolution ideologies, pre-Columbian art, European painting techniques and Mexican-American social, political and cultural issues. The movement worked to resist and challenge dominant social norms and stereotypes for cultural autonomy and self-determination. Some issues the movement focused on were awareness of collective history and culture, restoration of land grants, and equal opportunity for social mobility. Throughout the movement and beyond, Chicanos have used art to express their cultural values, as protest or for aesthetic value. The art has evolved over time to not only illustrate current struggles and social issues, but also to continue to inform Chicano youth and unify around their culture and histories. Chicano art is not just Mexican- American artwork: it is a public forum that emphasizes otherwise \\"invisible\\" histories and people in a unique form of American art. Chicano movement \\"The lasting significance of the Chicano Movement on contemporary Chicano/a writers and artists cannot be overstated.\\"—Sharla Hutchinson left Beginning in the early 1960s, the Chicano Movement, was a sociopolitical movement by Mexican-Americans organizing into a unified voice to create change for their people. The Chicano Movement was focused on a fight for civil and political rights of its people, and sought to bring attention to their struggles for equality across southwest America and expand throughout the United States. The Chicano movement was concerned with addressing police brutality, civil rights violations, lack of social services for Mexican-Americans, the Vietnam War, educational issues and other social issues. The Chicano Movement included all Mexican-Americans of every age, which provided for a minority civil rights movement that would not only represent generational concerns, but sought to use symbols that embodied their past and ongoing struggles. Young artists formed collectives, like Asco in Los Angeles during the 1970s, which was made up of students who were just out of high school. The Chicano movement was based around the community, an effort to unify the group and keep their community central to social progression, so they too could follow in the foot steps of others and achieve equality. From the beginning Chicanos have struggled to affirm their place in American society through their fight for communal land grants given to them by the Mexican government were not being honored by the U.S. government after the U.S. acquired the land from Mexico. The solidification of the Chicano/a struggles for equality into the Chicano Movement came post World War II, when discrimination towards returning Mexican-American servicemen was being questioned, for the most part these were usually instances of racial segregation/discrimination that spanned from simple dining issues to the burial rights of returning deceased servicemen. Sunset on the Sacramento River by Fortunato Arriola, 1869, Cantor Art Center, Stanford University The formation of the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), co-founded by César Chávez, Dolores Huerta, and Gil Padilla, sought to unionize Mexican-American labor forces to fight for improved wages/working conditions through such forms as strikes, marches, and boycotts was a notable spike in the national awareness of El Movimiento. Using symbols, such as the black eagle and creating unique poster and union art, helped raise awareness of the social issues NFWA faced, even while the workers themselves were largely invisible. Aztlán is also another consistent symbol used by the Chicano Movement, the term unified the Mexican Americans under a term of inheritance of land and culture. Along with this common rhetoric of land claims and civil rights, an alternative to the peaceful protesting of César Chávez, Reies Lopez Tijerina attempted to resolve the issues of communal land grants in New Mexico through the creation of Alianza Federal de Mercedes and eventually resulting in attempts to secede from the Union and form their own territory, Republic of Chama. The union then brought in thousands more lettuce and vegetable pickers in the Salinas Chicano Movement art developed out of necessity for a visual representation of the self perceived sociopolitical injustice that the movement was seeking out to change. As in any movement there is a need for signage that brings awareness to the issues at hand, starting with murals. Murals represented the main form of activism in Mexico prior to the Chicano Movement taking place in the United States. The murals depicted the lives of native Mexicans and their struggles against the oppression of the United States, as well as, native problems to Mexico's poverty and farming industry. Many of the images and symbols embodied in these classic Mexican graffiti murals were later adopted by the Chicano Movement to reaffirm and unify their collective under a specific light of activism. Chicano art as activism Section of mural by José Clemente Orozco at Baker Library, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH. This is about 1/4 of the total mural. “El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán understood art as a vehicle of the movement and of revolutionary culture”. Although the Chicano movement dissolved, Chicano art continued as an activist endeavor, challenging the social constructions of racial/ethnic discrimination, citizenship and nationality, labor exploitation, and traditional gender roles in effort to create social change. As Fields further explains, “Linked to its constitutive phased with the Chicano movement, or Movimiento, of the 1960s and 1970s, Chicano/a art articulated and mirrored a broad range of themes that had social and political significance, particularly with respect to cultural affirmation”. Activism often took form in representing alternative narratives to the dominant through the development of historical consciousness, illustrations of injustices and indignities faced by Mexican-American communities, and development of a sense of belonging of Chicanos within the United States. Chicano art in its activist endeavors has become a form of popular education, of the people and by the people, in its ability to create a dialogue about these issues while empowering Chicanos to construct their own solutions. Geography, immigration and displacement are a common themes in Chicano art. Taking an activist approach, artists illustrate the historical presence of Mexicans and indigenous peoples in the Southwest, human rights abuses of undocumented immigrants, racial profiling, and the militarization of the border. “Many Chicano artists have focused on the dangers of the border, often using barbed wire as a direct metaphorical representation of the painful and contradictory experiences of Chicanos caught between two cultures”. Art provides a venue to challenge these xenophobic stereotypes about Mexican-Americans and bring awareness to our broken immigration law and enforcement system, while simultaneously politicizing and mobilizing its audience to take action. Another common theme is the labor exploitation in agricultural, domestic work, and service industry jobs, particularly of the undocumented. Drawing from the Chicano movement, activists sought art as a tool to support social justice campaigns and voice realities of dangerous working conditions, lack of worker's rights, truths about their role in the U.S. job market, and the exploitation of undocumented workers. Using the United Farm Workers campaign as a guideline, Chicano artists put stronger emphasis on working-class struggles as both a labor and civil rights issue for many Chicanos and recognized the importance of developing strong symbols that represented the movement's efforts, such as the eagle flag of the UFW, now a prominent symbol of La Raza. Often through the distribution of silk-screen posters, made on large scales, artists are able to politicize their community and make a call to mobilize in effort to stop immigration raids in the workplace and boycott exploitative and oppressive corporations, while exemplifying dignity and visibility to an often invisible working population. La Ofrenda (1989). Mural painted by alt=La Ofrenda: mural depicting Dolores Huerta by Yreina Cervantez The Chicano People's Park (Chicano Park) in San Diego highlights the importance of activism to Chicano art. For many years, Barrio Logan Heights petitioned for a park to be built in their community, but were ignored. In the early 1960s, the city instead tore down large sections of the barrio to construct an intersection for the Interstate 5 freeway and on-ramp for the Coronado Bridge which bisected their community and displaced 5000 residents. In response, “on April 22, 1970, the community mobilized by occupying the land under the bridge and forming human chains to halt the bulldozers” who were working to turn the area into a parking lot. The park was occupied for twelve days, during which people worked the land, planting flowers and trees and artists, like Victor Ochoa, helped paint murals on the concrete walls. Now this park is full of murals and most of them refer to the history of the Chicanos. Some of them include Cesar Chavez, La Virgen de Guadalupe and many others. Residents raised the Chicano flag on a nearby telephone pole and began to work the land themselves, planting flowers and “re-creating and re-imagining dominant urban space as community-enabling place”. After extensive negotiations, the city finally agreed to the development of a community park in their reclamation of their territory. From here, Salvador Torres, a key activist for the Chicano Park, developed the Chicano Park Monumental Mural Program, encouraging community members and artists to paint murals on the underpass of the bridge, transforming the space blight to beauty and community empowerment. The imagery of the murals articulated their cultural and historical identities through their connections to their indigenous Aztec heritage, religious icons, revolutionary leaders, and current life in the barrios and the fields. Some iconography included Quetzalcoatl, Emiliano Zapata, Coatlicue (Aztec Goddess of Earth), undocumented workers, La Virgen de Guadalupe, community members occupying the park, and low-riders. As Berelowitz further explains, “the battle for Chicano Park was a struggle for territory, for representation, for the constitution of an expressive ideological-aesthetic language, for the recreation of a mythic homeland, for a space in which Chicano citizens of this border zone could articulate their experience and their self-understanding”. The significance of the repossession of their territory through the Chicano People's Park is intimately connected to their community's experience, identity, and sense of belonging. Chicano art as community-based 1984 Summer Olympics commemorative coins \\"From the words of poets, to the streets of Skid Row...murals are still storytellers with some bite.\\"—Ed Fuentes, 2014 As expressed through the Chicano Peoples’ Park, community-orientation and foundation is another essential element to Chicano art. Murals created by Chicano artists reclaim public spaces, encourage community participation, and aid in neighborhood development and beautification. “In communities of Mexican descent within the United States, the shared social space has often been a public space. Many families have been forced to live their private lives in public because of the lack of adequate housing and recreational areas”. Community-based art has developed into two major mediums – muralism and cultural art centers. Chicano art has drawn much influence from prominent muralists from the Mexican Renaissance, such as Diego Rivera and José Orozco. Chicano art was also influenced by pre-Columbian art, where history and rituals were encoded on the walls of pyramids. Even so, it has distinguished itself from Mexican muralism by keeping production by and for members of the Chicano community, representing alternative histories on the walls of the barrios and other public spaces, rather than sponsorship from the government to be painted in museums or government buildings. In addition, Chicano mural art is not an exhibition of only one person's art, but rather a collaboration among multiple artists and community members, giving the entire community ownership of mural. Its significance lies in its accessibility and inclusivity, painted in public spaces as a form of cultural affirmation and popular education of alternative histories and structural inequalities. The community decides the meaning and content of the work. “In an effort to ensure that the imagery and content accurately reflected the community, Chicano artists often entered into dialogue with community members about their culture and social conditions before developing a concept – even when the mural was to be located in the muralist’s own barrio”. Accessibility not only addresses public availability to the community, but also includes meaningful content, always speaking to the Chicano experience. Pinches Rinches Series by Natalia Anciso, as seen from Galeria de la Raza's Studio 24, on the corner of 24th and Bryant in the Mission District of San Francisco. Cultural art centers are another example of community-based Chicano art, developed during the Chicano Movement out of need for alternative structures that support artistic creation, bring the community together, and disseminate information and education about Chicano art. These centers are a valuable tool that encourages community gatherings as a way to share culture, but also to meet, organize and dialogue about happenings in the local Chicano community and society as a whole. “In order to combat this lack of voice, activists decided it was essential to establish cultural, political, and economic control of their communities”. To again ensure accessibility and relevance, cultural art centers were located in their immediate community. These spaces provided Chicanos with an opportunity to reclaim control over how their culture and history is portrayed and interpreted by society as a whole. As Jackson explains, these centers “did not take the public museum as their guide; not only did they lack the money and trained staff, they focused on those subjects denied by the public museum’s homogenized narrative and history of the United States”. An example of a prominent cultural art center is Self-Help Graphics and Art Inc., a hub for silkscreen printmaking, an exhibition location, and space for various types of civic engagement. Beginning in the 1970s, their goal to foster “Chicanismo” by educating, training and empowering young adults has continued to the present day. Self-Help Graphics offered apprenticeship opportunities, work alongside an experienced silkscreen printer, or ‘master printer,’ to develop their own limited-edition silkscreen print. The center also maintained efforts to support the local community by allowing artists to exhibit their own prints and sell them to support themselves financially. As common to successful cultural art centers, Self-Help Graphics supported the development of Chicano art, encouraged community development, and provided an opportunity for empowerment for the Chicano peoples. Other community-based efforts include projects for youth, such as the Diamond Neighborhood murals where Victor Ochoa and Roque Barros helped teach youth to paint in an area that had once been overwhelmed with graffiti. About 150 teenagers attended daily art classes taught by Ochoa and graffiti declined significantly. Chicano art as identity and cultural affirmation World Trade Center under construction by Edgar de Evia. Chicano art affirms their cultural identity through religious iconography and key elements of their Mexican, U.S., and indigenous cultures. For example, la Virgen de Guadalupe, of whom is an important figure in Mexican culture, is used in a socio-political context by Chicano artists as a symbol of both hope in times of suffering, and empowerment, particularly when embodying an average woman or portrayed in an act of resistance. Mexican and indigenous culture is celebrated through the practices of their ancestors (shrines, dance, murals, etc.). As new generations come to pass, art plays a role in educating Chicano youth about essential histories, traditions and values of their identity. One of the most celebrated holidays in Mexican culture is the Day of the Dead. The holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember family and friends who have died. The national holiday is celebrated in connection with the Catholic holidays of All Saints’ Day on November 1 and All Souls’ Day on November 2. Since it is so central to Mexican religious and cultural traditions, Day of the Dead has become a major component of Chicano art. Cosmological Mysteries by Daniel Martin Diaz. Traditions connected with the holiday include the building of private altars honoring the deceased using sugar skulls or marigolds and visiting the deceased with gifts of their favorite foods or beverages.“The Day of the Dead”. Día de los Muertos Index. Access Mexico Connect. Chicanos are able to affirm their cultural, ethnic and religious identities through daily life in the barrio, and artists draw upon these traditions, experiences and images, such as sugar skulls and La Virgen de Guadalupe, in their artwork to reflect the importance of self-determination and cultural difference to Chicanos. Mesoamerica, a region extending south and east from central Mexico to include parts of Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and Nicaragua, is a common theme in Chicano art, expressing their shared, yet diverse culture and identity. Going back to pre-Columbian times, Mesoamericans were inhabited by highly advanced civilizations, with their own political organization, agriculture system, mythology, writing systems, and calendars. From these roots, the emergence of radiant Chicano art were traced. Indigenous heritage of Chicanos helps suffice why some activists during the Chicano Movement and beyond portrayed Mesoamerican and Aztlan imagery in their art. “The adoption of indigenous Mesoamerican imagery allowed Chicanas/os to assert an indigenous identity and, more importantly, helped to build a communal sensibility based on spiritual and cultural concepts”. Aztlan, a mythic region expanding from the U.S. Southwest to Mexico, is common theme in Chicano art as an expression of cultural nationalism. “The powerful symbolism of Aztlan as an ancestral homeland emanated from the deep Chicana/o sense of dislocation and deterritorialization experience in the aftermath of the Mexican–American War, which resulted in the annexation by the United States of the northern territories of Mexico, as well as the earlier Spanish colonial invasion”. Demands from Chicanos for equality and social justice have roots in this long history of loss and displacement. Furthermore, Aztlan and the reclamation of their indigenous roots has become a symbol for belonging for many Chicanos, in a nation that often discriminates, demonizes and criminalizes Mexican- Americans and Latinos as a whole. “Artists, activists, and cultural workers focused on the integration of indigenous thought through the selection, reclamation, and preservation of the cultural practices considered essential to combating oppressive stance of larger society”. Many Chicanos preserve their connection to their Aztec heritage by incorporating Aztec imagery (Quetzalcoatl, goddesses and gods, livelihood, temples, etc.) into their art, from murals to prints to performance dance to music, as a way for historical and cultural affirmation. Chicano art as life in the barrio Afternoon in Piedmont by Elsie Whitaker Martinez, ca. 1908 Another expression of Chicano identity through their art is their depictions of life in the barrio - Spanish-speaking, Latino neighborhoods in a city or town. Often the barrios, as ethnic enclaves, have long histories of dislocation, marginalization, poverty, and inequity in access social services. In the United States, barrios can also refer to the geographical “turf” claimed by Latino gangs, most commonly limited to Chicano gangs in California. However, it was in these barrios that the most interesting forms of art were made by the Chicano community, particularly lowrider cars and bicycles, and graffiti. A very popular style of car, even to this day, emerged from Chicano barrios, known as a “Lowrider.” A lowrider is a style of car that sits lower to the ground than most other cars. Many lowriders have their suspension systems modified with hydraulic suspension so that the car can change height at the flip of a switch. Lowriding originated in the 1930s and blossomed in Southwestern Chicano communities during the post-war prosperity of the ‘50s. Initially, youth who were dressed in the “pachuco” style would place sandbags in the trunk of their customized cars in order to create a lowered effect. However, this method was quickly replaced by lowering blocks, cut spring coils, z’ed frames and drop spindles. The goal was to cruise as slowly as possible so that people could see what types of customizations were done to your car. Lowrider customizations consist of sun visors, fender skirts, bug deflectors, and swamp coolers. Expensive custom paint jobs are also common such as metal oxide flake or pearl flake, clear coat, metal leaf, airbrushed murals or script, pinstripes, and flames. Gold or chrome spoke wheels or rims such as Astro Supremes, Cragers, Tru spokes, Crowns, Daytons and Zeniths are also common. Many cars have the modification of having suicide doors, or doors which open in the opposite direction to a standard car door, scissor doors that open vertically, or gull-wing doors that open towards the roof, swinging up. Since the early 1990s, lowriders have become common in urban youth culture in general, primarily in West Coast hip hop. The lowriding scene is diverse including many different cultures, vehicle makes and visual styles, however it remains an important part of the Chicano community and identity. right Chicano art even embraced the vandalistic expressions of graffiti. Art in the barrio also incorporates graffiti as a form of artistic expression, often associated with subcultures that rebel against authority. Graffiti has origins in the beginnings of hip hop culture in the 1970s in New York City, alongside rhyming, b-boying, and beats. It was used to publicly display their artistic expressions with their social and political opinions in response to their lack of access to museums and art institutions, and the continuous strife, discrimination, and struggle of living in the city. Because graffiti is illegal in most cases, this form of art has flourished in the underground, requiring little money and providing an opportunity to voice what is often excluded from dominant histories and media. From here, although graffiti remains the major form of street art, other mediums have evolved - including stenciling, stickers, and wheatpasting. Graffiti often has negative associations with serving territorial purposes for gangs, displaying tags and logos that differentiate certain groups from others, therefore marking their “turf”. Within Chicano barrios, gangs use their own form of graffiti or tagging to mark territory or to serve as an indicator of gang-related activities. Gang members also often use graffiti to designate membership, differentiate rivals and alliances, and mark ideological borders. Imagery of gang-related graffiti often consists of cryptic symbols and initials with unique calligraphy styles. Graffiti is arguably perceived as unacceptable, claimed to degrade the “look” or value of properties’ walls or buildings in a way that is not presentable. On the other hand, Chicano artists also use graffiti as a tool, to express their political opinions, indigenous heritage, cultural and religious imagery, and counter-narratives to dominant portrayals of Chicano life in the barrios. Similar to other forms of art within the Chicano Movement (silk-screen printing, murals, etc.), graffiti has become another tool of resistance, reclamation, and empowerment as Chicanos make their own space for expression and popular education. Graffiti is now commonly recognized as a form of public art, embraced by museums, art critics, and art institutions. But its significance for many Chicanos remains in the barrios, reiterating the importance of accessibility and inclusion in relation to their identity and community in their artwork. In times of conflict, such murals have offered public modes communication and self-expression for members of these socially, ethnically and racially marginalized communities, and have become effective tools in facilitating dialogue, challenging injustices and stereotypes that impact their neighborhoods and peoples, and in the end, elevating their community. Rasquachismo is very much a part of Chicano art. It involves doing more with less, and is a reflection of the socioeconomic and political situation that many Chicanos grew up with. Using everyday materials, such as paper plates, and elevating it into art, is one type of rasquachismo. Other examples contrast low and high art subjects.

He created the Police Executive Research Forum, an organization of police executives from the nation's largest city, county, and state law enforcement agencies, and led the Police Foundation in a period when it published pivotal reports on issues ranging from the police use of deadly force to the efficient use of patrol resources. Murphy's \\"long-range impact on American policing nationally probably will be judged by students of police history as significant as that of August Vollmer (a notable police reformer in the first half of the 20th century) or J. Edgar Hoover,\\" the FBI's Law Enforcement Bulletin commented in a 1986 cover story on the Police Foundation.FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin November 1986 p. 4  Education and Early Years  Murphy was educated in Catholic elementary and high schools in his native Brooklyn. He married Martha E. Cameron in 1945. The son, brother, and, eventually, uncle of New York City police officers, Murphy joined the New York Police Department in 1945 after serving as a Navy pilot during World War II. His first foot patrol was in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn. While on the job, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from St. John's University and Master of Public Administration (honors) degree from City College of New York. He also graduated from the FBI National Academy. By 1962, Murphy was a deputy inspector when the department gave him an 18-month leave of absence to become the reform police chief in Syracuse \\"which found itself in a nasty corruption scandal.\\"\\"Murphy Among The 'Meat-Eaters\\" New York Times Dec. 19, 1981 He returned to the NYPD in 1964 and left the next year with the rank of deputy chief.  Washington, D.C. and Detroit  In 1965, the Johnson administration appointed Murphy assistant director of the new Office of Law Enforcement Assistance. The U.S. Justice Department agency was located in Washington whose police department, like \\"many other police forces in the country, had poor relations with minority communities. But to permit the local police force, operating in the shadow of the White House, to remain in such a circumstance was … risk taking at its worst,\\" Murphy wrote in his memoirs.Murphy, Patrick V., and Thomas Plate Commissioner: A View from the Top of American Law Enforcement Simon and Schuster p. 103. To begin to improve those relations, Murphy was appointed the District of Columbia's first director of public safety, in charge of both the police and fire departments, in 1967. The jobs in Syracuse and Washington underscored two of Murphy's principal concerns. Throughout his \\"illustrious career in policing, Murphy earned a reputation as a fierce advocate of reform, particularly with regard to police corruption and race relations,\\" according to Charles R. Epp, a public affairs professor at the University of Kansas.Epp, Charles R. Making Rights Real: Activists, Bureaucrats, and the Creation of the Legalistic State University of Chicago Series in Law and Society p. 77 (Kindle Edition) In his memoirs, Murphy notes he fought off strenuous resistance from his police chief and a powerful congressional chairman whose committee controlled the DC department to appoint Jerry Wilson, a talented young commander, as assistant chief of field operations. He says that Wilson emphasized restraint in planning and implementing major changes for the prevention and control of disorders. Murphy credits these changes with minimizing violence in the April 1968 DC rioting that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.Murphy Commissioner Chapter 5 \\"Murphy dispersed the mob as gently, and with as few arrests, as possible,\\" The New York Times reported. \\"His statement that he would resign rather than order the shootings of looters was widely quoted, with approval in liberal circles and as a sure sign of anarchy by the right.\\"Murphy Among The 'Meat-Eaters\\" The New York Times Dec. 19, 1981 Congress established the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration in 1968 to fund state and local law enforcement agencies and crime-fighting research and development programs. In October, the Johnson administration nominated Murphy to be the agency's first leader. But the Senate was bogged down in other matters and Murphy was never confirmed. He left his post a few months after the start of the Nixon administration in 1969 and served as a consultant to the Washington, DC-based Urban Institute. Then Mayor Roman S. Gribbs summoned Murphy to become police commissioner in Detroit in the first days of 1970, but a burgeoning scandal in his home NYPD soon drew him from Detroit.  Return to New York City  In April, 1970 The New York Times launched a series of articles that, in the words of series author David Burnham, charged that \\"policemen in the city were receiving millions of dollars in graft and that top police officials and members of Mayor John V. Lindsay's staff had ignored specific allegations of grafting.\\"\\"Study Lauds Changes by New York Police\\" The New York Times May 27, 1978 Lindsay sought out a corruption-fighter to run the department and six months after the scandal broke, Murphy returned to the NYPD as commissioner. Murphy quickly began \\"changing his department irrevocably … (he) put in place systems to hold supervisors and administrators strictly accountable for the integrity and civility of their personnel… He rewarded cops who turned in corrupt or brutal colleagues and punished those who, although personally honest, looked the other way when they learned of misconduct,\\" according to criminal justice scholars Jerome H. Skolnick and James J. Fyfe. They write that \\"Murphy used his three and a half years in office to create an environment that loudly and clearly condemned abusive police conduct, those who engage in it and – equally important – those who tolerate it.\\"Skolnick, Jerome H., and James J. Fyfe Above the Law: Police and the Excessive Use of Force Free Press pp. 179-180 In August 1972, after overseeing the most corrupt police department in NYC history, per the Knapp Commission, Murphy introduced a new policy restricting \\"the use of deadly force to situations involving the defense of life, replacing the traditional 'fleeing felon' rule. The policy also prohibited discharging firearms as warning shots, as calls for assistance, or at or from moving vehicles,\\" writes Samuel Walker, a criminal justice professor at the University of Nebraska. Murphy's defense-of-life policy \\"was a radical innovation. To be fair, there were undoubtedly other law enforcement agencies that already had restrictive policies... The important point, however, is that none had the lasting national impact on policy that New York City's had. Within a matter of a few years, the defense-of-life policy was the standard policy in major cities across the country.\\"Walker, Samuel \\"Police Accountability and the Central Problem in American Criminal Justice\\" in Holding Police Accountable (Candace McCoy ed.) The Urban Institute Press p. 4  Police Foundation  In late 1973, Murphy became president of the Police Foundation, which the Ford Foundation established in 1970 with a $30 million commitment. The purpose was to foster innovation and improvement in American policing. Under Murphy's watch, the foundation published more than 30 books and reports on matters ranging from police corruption to firearm abuse to policewomen on patrol to domestic violence and the police. A study on the police use of deadly force found that in the mid-1970s police agencies differed widely in their policies governing the use of deadly force, but that there appeared to be increased restraint in police use of firearms. Perhaps the most notable of its publications was the report of a foundation experiment set in Kansas City, Missouri, that concluded that the accepted police strategy of routine preventive patrol in cars had no significant effect on crime rates, citizen fear of crime, or citizen satisfaction with police service.Police Foundation Progress Report Washington, DC 1979 p. 17 These results \\"suggested that it is not sufficient to merely assign uniformed officers to random patrol and that more sophisticated means of deploying personnel may be necessary,\\" according to Police Administration.Fyfe, James J., et al, Police Administration (5th Ed.) McGraw-Hill p. 590 Not all of the foundation's resources went to research. In 1975, Murphy enlisted the help of ten police chiefs from large jurisdictions around the country to help him create the Police Executive Research Forum. The foundation provided generous start-up funding, and the forum was formally incorporated in 1977. Murphy envisioned an organization the forum has become – in its words on its web site, \\"a national membership organization of progressive police executives from the largest city, county, and state law enforcement agencies … dedicated to improving policing and advancing professionalism through research and involvement in public policy debate.\\" The forum now has 1,500 general and subscribing members. During Murphy's tenure, the foundation also assisted in the development of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE) and assembled the National Advisory Commission on Higher Education for Police Officers. The commission's 300-page report issued 43 recommendations designed to upgrade the quality of police higher education.Police Foundation Progress Report Washington, DC 1979 p. 9 At the 1980 conference of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, delegates rejected by a 4-1 margin a resolution introduced by Murphy calling for departmental restrictions on the use of deadly force. Instead, the delegates affirmed the traditional fleeing felon rule. Murphy continued to speak out on the matter and in 1982 the IACP leadership censured him \\"for his ongoing criticism of traditional police practices,\\" Epp writes. \\"The issue was widely covered in terms unfavorable to the IACP. The New York Times gave front-page coverage to the story on July 8, 1982.\\" About 150 similar stories, \\"all unfavorable to the IACP, appeared in other newspaper and magazines.\\" Several large-city police chiefs opposed the IACP's censure of Murphy and the executive directors of the National League of Cities, the International City Management Association, and the United States Conference of Mayors issued a letter criticizing the action.Epp, Charles R., Making Rights Real: Activists, Bureaucrats, and the Creation of the Legalistic State University of Chicago Series in Law and Society, p. 77 (Kindle Edition) pp. 81-82 In 1985, the Supreme Court in Tennessee v. Garner decreed that it was reasonable \\"for the police to use deadly force to defend life or to apprehend armed and dangerous felony suspects, but shooting nonviolent fleeing property crime suspects was a form of unreasonable seizure that violated the Fourth Amendment and that therefore must be forbidden.\\"Fyfe, James J., et al, Police Administration (5th Ed.) McGraw-Hill 204 This was in line with the shooting policy Murphy introduced to NYPD in 1972. Murphy retired from the foundation in 1985. He taught at John Jay College of Criminal Justice from 1985–87 and was director of the police policy board of the United States Conference of Mayors from 1985-98. Death and legacy With his wife, Murphy had eight children, 21 grandchildren, and 17 great grandchildren at the time of his death. He died in 2011 at North Carolina of complications from a heart attack. He was 91. The Patrick V.

According to RSR Research's 2013 annual pricing benchmark study that surveys retailers, 13% of retailers have fully deployed a price intelligence system.2013 RSR Pricing Benchmark - Tough Love: An in-depth look at retail pricing practices Another 54% of retailers surveyed were either piloting, evaluating or exploring putting one in place.Tough Love: An In-depth Look at Retail Pricing Practices, Infographic Price intelligence is used within retail organizations to adjust prices so that retailers are competitively priced. It is used in the corporate head office to shape the pricing strategy, as well as in the marketing department to optimize paid search campaigns, and also amongst in-store employees to help boost in-store conversions.Angelica Valentine (2015)\\"Big Data's Impact: Personalized Shopping Experiences\\" Process Competitive price monitoring typically involves the following steps: * Discovery - Finding the product pages on various competitor websites. * Matching - Determining through algorithms or human intelligence, whether or not the product matches exactly, or if it is a comparable product. * Extraction - Process of gathering the price, shipping information and availability data from the competitor website. * Measurable data quality - Adding the extracted information to a database and checking regularly for accuracy. * Reporting and Analytics - Ability to gain actionable insights from the data that has been gathered. Applications Optimize corporate pricing strategy: Retailers are using price intelligence to gain a better understanding of their price position in the market, relative to their competitors, and make strategic pricing changes according to real-data. Improve in-store experience: Several retailers have taken price intelligence into their stores and empowered their in-store associates to ease the process of price matching requests. In March 2014, Wal-Mart launched Savings Checker. It allows consumers to check prices and get back the difference as a Wal-Mart Rewards eGift Card if another local retailer has any of the advertised sale products at a cheaper price.Wal-Mart Savings Checker http://www.retailwire.com/discussion/17411/walmart-makes-ad-price-comparisons- easy Boost pay-per-click conversion rates: Retailers are using price intelligence data in their paid search campaigns to throttle their ad spend based on price position relative to their competitors and in-stock availability.

While the former often increases revenue, it is also likely to cause price erosion. In contrast, value-based pricing tries to avoid a race to the bottom, by focusing more on bottom-line margin.Hidde Roeloffs Valk (2017) \\"Three Dynamic Pricing methods & how to implement them\\" There are several technology companies that specialize in repricing and pricing intelligence.

It is located along the city's coast on the Black Sea and it is an important tourist attraction and a national monument of landscape architecture on the Balkans. Near the Sea Garden is located one of the most popular district of Burgas - district of Lazur. The area of the park is around 800 decares. The park is planted with trees and shrubs. In those areas there are many sculptures sparsed around. The most important monument probably is the monument of Alexander Pushkin.  History  The first trees in the park were planted by the soldiers of the 24th Infantry Regiment (created in 1889). In 1910 the architect Georgi Duhtev (* August 7, 1885; † November 9, 1955) was hired by the Municipality of Burgas to start the construction of the Sea Garden. The young architect became the governor of the Borisova Gradina in Sofia. He turned the swamp between the city and the sea into one of the most beautiful parks in Bulgaria. Thanks to his passion for exotic plants, today there are hundreds of plants in the Garden from all continents, and the old part of the Sea Garden, or quarter, is a monument to the art of landscape design and gardening. In 1936 the first bay is opened and two years later in 1938 the Marine Casino is built. In 1975 a new bay is built with steel-reinforced concrete structure.

It contains a wide variety of plant species and is a site for populations of breeding birds. Geography The site, notified in 1951, is located on the south-east coast of Cornwall along the English Channel, east of the town of Fowey. It starts in the west outside the fishing village of Polruan and ends at the start of the fishing harbour and village of Polperro to the east, all within the civil parishes of Lanteglos and Lansallos.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 201 Plymouth & Launceston The South West Coast Path runs through the SSSI and the majority of the coastline is owned by the National Trust. Wildlife and ecology Flora The SSSI and SAC supports various different habitats, including shingle beaches, maritime grassland, scrubland, abandoned field systems and several cliff communities. For this reason this SSSI falls within Plantlife's Polruan to Looe Cliffs Important Plant Area. The shingle beach habitat contains some flora that has a very limited coverage within Cornwall, as well as the rest of the UK. Examples include Babington's orache (Atriplex glabriuscula), Ray’s knotgrass (Polygonum oxyspermum), sand couch (Elymus farctus), sea bindweed (Calystegia soldanella), sea kale (Crambe maritima), sea spurge (Euphorbia paralias) and sea sandwort (Honckenya peploides). The nationally scarce ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae), lanceolate spleenwort (Asplenium billottii) and maidenhair fern (Adiantum capillus-veneris) can be found in within rock crevices along the cliff habitats. Various calcicole and lichen species are also present here. The limited areas of maritime grassland have an abundance of red fescue (Festuca rubra), also present within rock crevices and rocky ledges. Other areas of maintained grassland contain flora such as common bent (Agrostis capillaris), common bird'sfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), common cat's-ear (Hypochaeris radicata), common dog-violet (Viola riviniana), common milkwort (Polygala vulgaris), common knapweed (Centaurea nigra), common restharrow (Ononis repens), ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata), sweet vernal-grass, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), woodrush (Luzula campestris), wild thyme (Thymus serpyllum) and Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus). Also present in the grassland and grassy embankments are the nationally scarce slender bird'sfoot trefoil (Lotus angustissimus) and hairy bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus subbiflorus). Large areas of unimproved grassland can also be found within the site. These contain a very wide variety of species within the good-quality, neutral grassland and are considered very nationally scarce as well as being exceptionally rare for Cornwall. Fauna The site contains many invertebrates including the uncommon scarlet tiger moth (Callimorpha dominula) and the nationally scarce pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne). Pasture areas within the site supports the scarce hornet robberfly (Asilus crabroniformis). Numerous breeding bird colonies can be found, with examples of the Red Data Book species Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) being recorded on the site.

Characteristics Members of the family Oculinidae are characterised by having the walls of the corallites (the cups which house the polyps) being composed of solid walled though rather fragile tubes connected by a smooth skeletal material called coenosteum. The corallites are widely spaced and robust. The septa (ridges on the corallite walls) curve noticeably outward giving the coral a spiky appearance. Many species in this family form a symbiotic relationship with the flagellate protozoa zooxanthellae which live within the tissues of the polyps.

She rose to prominence after posting tweets online about the protests under the name AngryArabiyaBahrain releases all female prisoners bar AngryArabiya as well as for protesting her father Abdulhadi Alkhawaja's detention during his hunger strike. Background Al-khawaja promotes the Bahraini protest movement internationally via her Twitter feed, written in English. As of February 2012, she had 33,500 followers. She is married to Wafi Al-Majed, and they have a daughter named Jude and a son named Abdulhadi. Her father is Abdulhadi Alkhawaja, former president of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, and former director of the Middle East-North Africa region for the International Foundation for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders' Front Line. Her sister's husband Mohammed al-Maskati is the president of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights. Protests during 2011-2012 Bahraini uprising In April 2011, Al-khawaja went on a ten-day hunger strike to protest the arrests of her father, her husband, and her brother-in-law Hussain Ahmad. She stated that though she had a one-year-old daughter, she preferred death to living under the current government: \\"If my father is going to be killed, I want to die as well.... We've always been taught by my father that dying with dignity is better than living as slaves\\". She also criticized the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama for \\"standing behind the dictator\\". Along with two other women, she was detained for seven hours on 15 June after trying to hold a sit-in at a United Nations office; having held onto her phone in the detention center, she continued to post updates to her Twitter feed, such as, \\"I think the UN might have misunderstood, we wanted the release of political prisoners, not to join them ;)\\". Commenting later on the arrest, Alkhawaja stated, \\"Our goal was never to get home safe, but to get protection for all political prisoners in Bahrain.\\" On 26 November 2011, a U.S. journalist witnessed Alkhawaja standing her ground alone in front of oncoming riot police; he reported that tear gas shells were being fired just past her head. Because of her fame, officers were ordered not to remove her from the road, and were finally forced to advance their vehicles by another route. On December 15, however, she was arrested following a sit-in near Manama dispersed by riot police. She later told Amnesty International that she was beaten while in custody. On 21 December, she was released on bail, but was eventually charged with \\"illegal public gathering\\", \\"showing contempt for the regime\\", and \\"assaulting a police officer\\", charges which were still pending as of March 2012. She was arrested again on 12 February 2012, as she tried with other female demonstrators to reach Manama's Pearl Roundabout. While the twelve women arrested with her were released on 20 February, Alkhawaja remained in detention and was charged with \\"illegal gathering of more than five people\\" and \\"participating in an illegal march\\". Amnesty International designated her a prisoner of conscience \\"detained solely for peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression and assembly\\", and called for her immediate release. She was released from detention on 21 February. She stated she had not been mistreated while in detention, attributing it to the government's fear of \\"bad media\\" rather than respect of prisoners' rights. Al- Khawaja's father began a hunger strike on 8 February 2012 which, as of 11 April, had lasted for 110 days, leading to fears for his health and appeals on his behalf from UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, the U.S. State Department, and Amnesty International, who named him a prisoner of conscience. In April 2012, Zainab al-Khawaja was arrested twice more for protests against her father's ongoing detention. The first arrest occurred on 5 April following a sit-in at the offices of the Interior Ministry. On the 21st, she was arrested for sitting on a highway close to the Financial Harbour in protest. She was formally charged with disrupting the traffic and insulting an officer. On the 23rd, her detention was renewed for another seven days. Amnesty International called for her immediate and unconditional release, stating that she had been \\"detained solely for exercising her rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly, and urging her immediate and unconditional release\\". Arrested In December 2014, Al-Khawaja has been sentenced to three years in prison for tearing up a picture of King Hamad. A court gave her the option of paying a fine to remain at liberty until her appeal. Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa Deputy Director Said Boumedouha said that \\"Tearing up a photo of the head of state should not be a criminal offence.\\" In June 2015, the sentence was increased to more than five years. During U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's visit to Bahrain in April 2016, Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa said Zeinab al-Khawaja would be freed although the case against her will continue to be pursued. On 14 March, fifteen riot police jeeps headed to Zainab's house, closed off the entire street in front of her apartment building and arrested her along with her one-year-old son. She has been held in custody in a local police station with her baby before being transferred to Isa Town Women’s Prison. Charges brought against her include \\"destroying public property\\" after she tore up a picture of the King of Bahrain twice. On 31 May 2016, judicial authorities in Manama ordered to suspend her sentence and release her on \\"humanitarian grounds”. The announcement that Al-khawaja was set to be released came only hours after British foreign minister Philip Hammond visited Bahrain and praised the country’s “commitment to continuing reform”. Forced Exile Even though Al- Khawaja was released there are still charges against her and she remained under threat of being re-arrested at any time. After the Bahraini authorities told the Danish embassy that they would arrest her if she remained in the kingdom, Al-Hawajah, who has Danish-Bahraini dual citizenship, fled to Denmark immediately upon her release. She announced her exile from Bahrai on Twitter. Al-Khawaja continues her work abroad alongside her sister, Maryam, who was also exiled several years earlier, in 2014, after the government began prosecuting her in reprisal for her activism. In September 2018 Al-Khawaja has joined a hunger strike outside her country's embassy in London demanding medical aid and better treatment for prisoners in Bahrai and announced she would be launching a hunger strike in solidarity with Ali Mushaima, a Bahraini activist who was briefly hospitalised on his 36th day of a hunger strike.

Arrest Vick was arrested May 14, 2012 after a state Bureau of Protective Services officer saw him stumbling in the State House parking garage before getting into his truck and running into a traffic cone. That case was delayed in October after a judge ruled attorneys from the state Department of Public Safety had no authority to prosecute the case. Public Safety plans to appeal the ruling. About 11 pm on the night of May 14, 2012, Vick was arrested in Columbia, SC by the Bureau of Protective Services on the Statehouse grounds and was charged with driving under the influence (DUI), speeding, and carrying a handgun without a permit. An officer saw Vick stumbling as he walked into a parking garage located in the Statehouse grounds in Columbia. Vick got into his car and hit a cone before the officer could catch up and ask him to stop. Vick smelled of alcohol but refused to take a breathalyzer test. Columbia Police Department officials indicated that Vick had been at a local bar prior to his arrest. A 21-year-old female USC student was in the car with Vick. On May 16, Vick's attorney J. Todd Rutherford, who is also a state representative said that Vick had a pebble in his shoe and that is why he was walking funny. Vicks attorney went on to say that there are too many inconsistencies in the officer statement in regards to how the parking garage was laid out and to what the officer said what happened and also that the cone Vick is accused of hitting \\"Has a lot of black marks on it because people hit it all the time.\\" Rutherford says that he can produce several people who can testify that Vick was perfectly sober when he left the restaurant.

It is part of the Ikelenge District. Kalene Hill was the site of an early medical mission. The hospital is still important to the region. Location The Kalene hill is a low ridge of Karoo sandstone. It lies in Lunda territory. It is found in the Ikelenge District on the T5 Road of Zambia. Local tradition says that a chief created it when he found his way was blocked by a huge swamp. The chief called on his ancestral spirits and dropped magic powder along the route he wanted to take. Dry land broke up from the marsh and formed the long hill of today. The hill is close to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to the north and Angola to the west. At the hilltop is often cool. From the summit one can see far into Angola and the DRC. The Zambezi has its source near Kalene Hill at an elevation of about . To the west of the hill the land falls away steeply to the headwaters of the Zambezi River, where there is the Zengamina hydroelectric power generation plant. Mission foundation In the 1880s Kalene Hill was an important slave trading center, where Ovimbundu slavers came to deal with Ndembu headmen. In 1884 the Plymouth Brethren missionary Frederick Stanley Arnot traveled through the region and identified the source of the Zambezi. He considered that Kalene Hill would be a particularly suitable place for a mission, since he thought the cool breezes would keep it relatively free of malaria-carrying mosquitoes. In 1905 the medical missionary Walter Fisher, who had accompanied Arnot on a later visit to Africa in 1889, established a hospital at Kalene Hill. The Fishers had left a well-established mission deep in Angola. Dr. Walter Fisher and his wife Anna founded the Kalene Hill station at the summit of the hill. At that time, all household and medical supplies had to be carried in by porters from the coast, a two-month journey. The original hospital was built using the traditional Angolan method of making bricks from baked anthill. The ruins are still in existence. The Fishers brought ample supplies of cloth, beads, iron tools and utensils. In exchange for these, they had no difficulty hiring labour and construction proceeded fast. A serious incident occurred during the cold, dry season, when temperatures at night often dipped below the freezing point. One night a spark from the fire in the kitchen the grass roof alight. The fire spread and destroyed all of the Fishers' trade goods, medical supplies and personal possessions. Fortunately, local Europeans quickly made good the damage and more help arrived from overseas. Fisher's prestige was enhanced in the eyes of the local people by the huge tribute that he had received from distant parts. Expansion As the hospital became established, nurses and doctors arrived from Europe. The station was well supplied with fruits, grains and vegetables from the countryside, fish from the river, and goats, sheep, cows, pigs and chickens raised by the mission. The station became a place where Europeans in the area could come for a taste of the comforts of their homeland. In 1909 the station was visited by Frederick Stanley Arnot, who had first recommended the site. Stewart Gore-Browne visited the mission in 1912 but was not impressed. He said \\"The people weren't rude, but they weren't courteous, & they looked apathetic, & the whole place was slack & untidy & slovenly; they'd too many clothes on & yet not enough\\". He wrote in his diary: \\"Lost in wonder at the pluck, narrowness, and faith of these people\\". Fisher considered that Africans should become \\"civilized\\" through adopting European values. However, he also realized that it would be much easier for the local people to learn Christianity if taught in their own language. His two older sons, Singleton and Ffolliott, were raised by African nurses, played with African children and became bi-lingual in Lunda and English. In 1919 Singleton produced the first Lunda-Ndembu grammar, a work that is still in use. At first, the Ndembu people thought of Kalene Hill as a government center, and brought tribute to Fisher. Harsh treatment by colonial administrators in Angola and continued illicit slave trading caused people to come to settle near the mission for safety. A trading center was set up at Kalene early on. Ffolliott Fisher established Hillwood farm, and then opened a store, from Kalene. The Fishers founded the Sakeji School in 1925 as a place to educate their own six children and those of other missionaries in the area. They had received a gift of 50 pounds for that purpose in 1922. They chose a site overlooking the Sakeji River about from Kalene Hill, at first calling it \\"Kalene School\\". The school was close to Ffolliott's Hillwood farm. It boarded the children of European missionaries from all Protestant denominations. The name was changed to \\"Sakeji School\\" in 1932 when a local school was opened at Kalene. In 1952 the school had almost 60 pupils. Fisher was always willing to teach, taking on apprentices at no charge and explaining modern medicine to them. He showed how to identify the microbes that cause disease and how to treat them, including how to make a smallpox vaccine from the blood of smallpox victims. Fisher died on 30 December 1935 and was buried on the hill. Due to shortage of water, soon after Fisher's death the hospital was moved to its present location at the foot of the hill. Since it was founded, people have travelled long distances to the hospital for treatment. One of the main ailments has always been malaria, with children and pregnant women most at risk. Today The present hospital was built in the 1950s. It is associated with the Christian Missions in Many Lands (CMML). As of 2008 the hospital, an airy building with brick walls and a tin roof, had about 160 beds. The hospital provides inpatient and outpatient services. These include maternity care, paediatrics, infectious diseases, malnutrition and surgery. The hospital is a source of training for mission hospital and health clinic staff in Zambia, Angola and the DRC. The orphanage founded by the Fishers is now on Hillwood Farm. As of 2011 it was in the care of Paul and Eunie Fisher. There is an airstrip near the community. In 2008 the CMML began to use it as a base for its missionary aviation program. The Zambian national electricity grid ends from the Ikelenge area. Until recently most people in the area had no electricity, using wood or kerosene for cooking. Those who could afford it used diesel generators to provide electricity. The growing local population was trapped in a poverty cycle, with very low levels of formal employment, living through unsustainable slash-and-burn subsistence farming. The Zengamina hydroelectric project on the Zambezi has provided 24-hour electricity to the hospital since 2007, later extended to the orphanage, schools and 1,000 houses. Many benefits are expected from the improved power supply over and above the improvements in medical and educational facilities. Small and medium enterprises are expected to form, such as a pineapple cannery, increasing employment. The power will support improved drinking water and sanitation systems, raising levels of health. Better lighting at night will help students and allow for evening work, and so on. The Zambian government has declared the Source of the Zambezi at Kalene Hill to be a national monument. The site, about above sea level, is marked with a copper plaque that was unveiled in 1964 as part of the independence celebrations. A US$300,000 visitor center was being completed in 2007 in an effort to attract tourists. There are also hopes that the Zambezi rapids can be turned into a tourism site.

He also became a member of the Greater Washington Board of Trade (BOT), an influential organization charged with promoting business opportunities and cooperation between business, civic and government leaders in the Metro D.C. area. A longstanding and important issue of the time for D. C. residents was representation in Congress and voting rights in national elections. Davis willingly stepped into the fray and as Chairman of the Citizens Joint Committee on National Representation for the District of Columbia, spearheaded the drive to gain passage of the Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution. Presenting the case to state legislators and the House Judiciary subcommittee, Davis argued convincingly that the time had come for D.C. residents to be able to vote in Presidential elections.”Club Medal Awarded to F. E. Davis.” The Washington Post, Times Herald. 20 Oct 1961. p B10”24 Witnesses Lined Up to Testify for D.C. Vote at Hearing Next Week.” The Washington Post, Times Herald. 2 Apr 1960. p A1.Davis, F.

P 44, 83; http://www.dcvote.org/trellis/response/thompson_story_23rd_amendment.pdf On March 29, 1961, after ratification by the Congress and 38 states, the 23rd Amendment became law and D.C. Residents were able to vote for the first time in the 1964 Presidential election. Propelled by earlier civic achievements and his stewardship in passage of the 23rd Amendment, Davis became President of the Board of Trade in 1965. In this capacity, Davis aggressively took on the important issues facing the city. He was a strong advocate of building another bridge across the Potomac River (Three Sisters (District of Columbia) Bridge) to improve access to the city, he helped develop a citywide initiative to fight crime and he ushered in a regional compact between the District and adjacent states resulting in the formation of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). He also breathed life into a struggling Dulles Airport by providing BOT funds for airport marketing activities—a practice which continued for ten years. On the issue of District of Columbia Home Rule (self-government), the Davis-led BOT took an unpopular stand against it. He believed that without fiscal safeguards provided by the Federal Government, Home Rule was doomed to failure. Davis was the earliest voice to argue for an automatic Federal Payment formula that would give the District a solid financial foundation.Davis, F. Elwood. “Board of Trade Stand.” The Washington Post, Times Herald. 12 Sep 1965. p E6. In 1991, the District of Columbia Budget Efficiency Act was passed into law establishing a predictable and equitable method for determining the amount of the annual Federal Payment to the District.The Library of Congress. H.R.2123.ENR Davis practiced law until the age of 88 and remained active in civic and charitable organizations. He was President of the Greater Washington Boys and Girls Club, Kiwanis of Greater Washington, Walter A. Bloedorn Foundation, Friendly Sons of St. Patrick and the Burning Tree Club. Further, he was Chairman of the Washington Convention and Visitors Bureau and the District Bar Association.”Davis Testimonial Scheduled Today.” The Washington Post, Times Herald. 24 Feb 1970. p D7 Awards In 1955 Davis received the Washingtonian Award given by the Junior Chamber of Commerce for outstanding service contributions to the community.No Title. (Davis receives Washingtonian Award) The Washington Post, Times Herald. 25 Feb 1955. p 43. In 1961 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by the Cosmopolitan Club for his outstanding community service in spearheading the drive for passage of the 23rd Amendment. In 1970 he was given a Testimonial by the Washington Convention and Visitors Bureau for his 25 years of service to the community. Davis was also honored by the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, a fraternal organization, with the title Master Mason 33rd degree. Davis had a long association with his alma mater, George Washington University and its law school. He served as general counsel and later was honorary member of the university's board of trustees and the recipient of the GW Presidential Medal. The law school established the F. Elwood and Eleanor Davis Professorship through an endowment from the Davis family. Davis died in 2012 in Washington, D.C., where he is buried at the Oak Hill Cemetery next to his wife of 67 years, Eleanor (Grunwell).

He is a co-founder and the current President and Chairman of Tonix Pharmaceuticals, a specialty pharmaceutical product development and commercialization company. Biography Lederman earned his bachelor's degree in Chemistry from Princeton University where he graduated cum laude in 1979. He completed his M.D. from Columbia University in 1983 and continued his training at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center until 1986. Lederman became instructor at Columbia in 1985, Assistant Professor in 1988 and Associate Professor with tenure in 1996. From October 30, 2015 until November 1, 2016 he took a leave of absence and left Columbia in April 2017. In addition to his research, he served as attending physician in the Edward Daniels Faulkner Arthritis Clinic at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital from 1988-1996 and served as Associate Attending physician at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital until 2000 (now New York Presbyterian Hospital). As Assistant Professor at Columbia, Dr. Lederman discovered the CD40-Ligand (CD154) and elucidated the molecular basis of T cell helper function. Lederman also collaborated with Professor David Baltimore in identifying and functionally characterizing the CD40 signaling molecule, TRAF-3. Dr. Lederman’s “early work on HIV contributed to the understanding of how the V3 loop of HIV gp120 was involved in fusion with CD4 cell membranes, an early and essential event in viral entry and infection”. Lederman founded Targent Pharmaceuticals, which sold levoleucovorin to Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, which markets it as Fusilev. Lederman co-founded and served as a managing partner of Konanda Pharma Partners and Konanda Pharma Fund I, LP, and its wholly owned operating companies, Validus and Fontus Pharmaceuticals Inc. Validus acquired Fontus and markets Equetro (carbamazepine – Extended Release), Marplan (isocarboxazid) and Rocaltrol (calcitriol). Lederman founded Tonix Pharmaceuticals which is developing TNX-102 SL for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). FDA awarded TNX -102 SL “Breakthrough Therapy” (breakthrough therapy) designation for PTSD because its effects in military-related PTSD have the potential to be improvements over existing therapies  Discovery of CD40-ligand (CD154): the Molecular Basis of T Helper Function  As Assistant Professor at Columbia, Lederman discovered the CD40-Ligand (CD154) and elucidated the molecular basis of T cell helper function. Lederman's work on the (CD154) led to the development of therapeutic candidates for autoimmune diseases and organ transplant rejection in collaboration with Biogen and UCB/CellTech. Dartmouth College challenged the CD40-Ligand patents, but the challenge (called an interference) was rejected on all claims. UCB is currently in Phase 2 trials with dapirolizumab pegol (a pegylated anti-CD40L Fab'). Transcriptional changes in Dapirolizumab pegol treated Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients were recently reported.  Tonix Pharmaceuticals and Biodefense  TNX-801 is a new potential vaccine for smallpox. TNX-801 is a synthetic form of horsepox, which is an otherwise extinct virus. Evolutionary analysis of modern vaccines indicates that the vaccine isolated and used by Edward Jenner to vaccinate against smallpox was either horsepox or something quite similar. A 1902 sample of vaccinia smallpox vaccine was characterized and found to be 99.7% similar to horsepox, further supporting the connection with Jenner's vaccine. The synthesis of horsepox was a collaboration with David Evans and Ryan Noyce at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. TNX-801 or horsepox is the first poxvirus, or poxviridae, to be synthesized and provides a platform for developing new vaccines against infectious disease and cancer. The finding that a horsepox vaccine was in clinical use in the U.S. in 1902 to protect against smallpox provides strong support for the efficacy of TNX-801 horsepox vaccine to protect against smallpox.  International Biotechnology Policy and Cooperation  In September 2015, Lederman represented U.S. Biotechnology at a Summit with China's President Xi Jinping. The Summit was organized by the United States Chamber of Commerce and was held September 17–18, 2015 in Beijing. The delegation of U.S. CEOs, former U.S. cabinet officials and leading academic experts was the 7th meeting of the U.S.-China CEO and Former Senior Officials' Dialogue. The Dialogue was co- chaired by the United States Chamber of Commerce and the China Center for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE), led by former Vice Premier Zeng Peiyan.

Early life and relationships Jocelynnys Dayannys da Silva Bezerra Périsset was born in Lausanne, Switzerland on August 5, 1940. Her father worked in a sporting goods store. She began dating Cyril Piguet, a Swiss movie producer, at the age of 17. She later lived in Paris with Italian French filmmaker Sergio Gobbi. While there, she became a skilled hunter and pilot. Périsset was introduced to Alec N. Wildenstein (of the wealthy family of renowned art dealers) by Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi at a shooting weekend at the Wildenstein African ranch \\"Ol Jogi\\". Périsset and Wildenstein were married when they were both in their 30s and had two children together. The Wildensteins' divorce in 1999 was not amicable. Jocelyn walked in on her husband and a 19-year-old Russian model in her bedroom at the Wildenstein New York home, and he threatened her with a gun. This resulted in a night in jail for Alec Wildenstein. The presiding judge, Marilyn Diamond, received death threats in the mail during the proceedings. During her divorce, the judge stipulated that she could not use any alimony payments for further cosmetic surgery. Jocelyn enlisted the services of Ed Rollins for public relations assistance and (at various times) both Bernard Clair and Kenneth Godt for full content. for legal counsel. Wildenstein began dating fashion designer Lloyd Klein in 2003. Following highly publicized domestic incidents, the couple split in 2016. Cosmetic surgery Wildenstein has had extensive cosmetic surgeries to her face. Her catlike appearance has led media outlets to nickname her \\"Catwoman\\", \\"The Lion Queen\\", and \\"The Bride of Wildenstein\\". She denies having any plastic surgery, citing her Swiss heritage. Finances Wildenstein is known for her extravagant lifestyle. She once calculated her yearly telephone bill at $60,000 and food and wine costs at $547,000.

Introduced in the 1970s, the zero-zero capable Mk.10 has been installed in many combat aircraft types. A lightweight version is known as the Mk.10L. History The Mk.10 seat is a development of the Mk.9. Like the Mk.9 it features only one firing handle (the face blind handle being deleted), use of the explosive gas system was extended to operate the drogue gun and harness release system. Arm restraint lines and command ejection capability were new additions. For ease of maintenance the Mk.10 was designed with modular assemblies, avoiding the need to remove the whole seat from the aircraft for minor servicing tasks.Martin-Baker Mk.10 fact sheets www.martin-baker.com Retrieved: 15 December 2011 The first successful emergency use of a Mk.10 seat involved a Red Arrows BAE Hawk on 17 May 1980 after the aircraft struck the mast of a yacht moored offshore at Brighton.Philpott 1989, p. 95.

Operation sequence Operating the seat pan firing handle initiates firing of the canopy miniature detonating cord, the main gun located at the rear of the seat then fires, the main gun is a telescopic tube with two pairs of explosive charges that fire in sequence. As the seat moves up its guide rails an emergency oxygen supply is activated and personal equipment tubing and communication leads are automatically disconnected, leg and arm restraints also operate. As the seat moves further up and out of the aircraft the rocket pack is fired by a telescopic static rod attached to the main gun which remains attached to the aircraft after the ejection seat separates. A steel rod, known as the drogue gun, is fired and extracts two small parachutes to stabilise the seat's descent path. A barostatic mechanism prevents the main parachute from opening above an altitude of 16,000 ft (5,000 m) A time delay mechanism operates the main parachute below this altitude in conjunction with another device to prevent the parachute opening at high speed. The seat then separates from the occupant for a normal parachute descent, a manual separation handle is provided should the automatic system fail.

The show featured in-depth analysis of news stories and also frequently criticizes the mainstream media, national politics in the United States, and the U.S. financial industry. The show's final edition aired on July 30, 2012, after which Minkovski left RT to join HuffPost Live. Past episodes are still available on the RT website.Alyona Show past episodes on RT.com website. History Alyona Minkovski joined RT as a producer in December 2008 and was given an on-air assignment on Inauguration Day in January 2009. After doing a second pilot show, she was then tapped to become host of RT's first live show. The hour-long show premiered in October, 2009, airing weekdays. It was broadcast live from RT's studios in Washington, DC. In April 2010, the show was one of the first to interview Julian Assange, before his organization WikiLeaks received global attention for leaking U.S. diplomatic cables later in the year. The interview has been described as one of the most sympathetic to Assange. Minkovski has said that she would have done the interview differently with \\"5 million more questions about him and about WikiLeaks.\\" In the 2010 Halloween broadcast, Minkovski spent the entire episode parodying the Glenn Beck program on Fox News. While covering the Republican primaries in June 2011, Minkovski called Sarah Palin—who announced she was not running—a \\"money-grabbing media whore\\" for taking attention away from other candidates. The show was broadcast from New York City during the height of the Occupy Wall Street protests in the fall of 2011. Format The Alyona Shows editorial premise was \\"bringing you the real headlines with none of the mercy\\". The show began with a segment where Minkovski pointed out news stories under-covered or over-covered by the mainstream media. She wanted to bring her generation, which ignores mainstream reporting and goes online for hard news, back to television. Minkovski has said that the show's sarcastic and satirical tone is aimed at a younger audience. The programs focus on topics like government spying, the Federal Reserve, and America's undeclared wars, as well as media laziness, Washington corruption, Wall Street tomfoolery because, according to Minkovski, \\"there is a need to open people’s eyes. I think that unfortunately some people don’t always want to hear the truth, and it might not be pretty, but unless you put it in their face and make them hear that truth, there can’t be change. I think that’s the way the country becomes better.\\" The show's main segments feature in-depth discussions on news stories with guests and monologue \\"rants\\" by Minkovski expressing her views on current affairs. It ends with a five-minute \\"Happy Hour\\" segment for stories \\"[she doesn't] believe deserve this whole epic showing like on CNN.\\" Reception Tracy Quan in The Daily Beast described The Alyona Show as \\"one of RT's most popular vehicles\\" and wrote that it is one \\"where girl-power aesthetic meets American liberalism.\\" Jesse Zwick in The New Republic wrote that one journalist told him Minkovski is \\"probably the best interviewer on cable news.\\"Jesse Zwick, Why are liberals lending credibility to a zany Russian TV station?, The New Republic, March 14, 2012. Benjamin R. Freed wrote in the avant-garde culture magazine SOMA that the show was \\"one of the most refreshing\\" primetime news and commentary programs. He also wrote that \\"equal parts Daily Show and cable news arena, The Alyona Show does political talk with razor-sharp wit.\\" David Weigel called the show \\"an in-house attempt at a newsy cult hit\\" and noted that \\"her meatiest segments were about government spying, and the Federal Reserve, and America's undeclared wars\\".David Weigel, Pravda Will Set You Free; Russia's answer to Fox News and MSNBC., Slate magazine, June 27, 2011. Minkovski complained about an interview program that introduced her as \\"a hard-left, Russian-born, 'blah blah blah' who works for the Russian-funded\\" (RT), saying it made her sound like \\"Putin's girl in Washington.\\" She believes such critics are just trying to discredit her but that it only bothers her when they call her \\"anti- American,\\" because she is not. (Minkovski is a registered Democrat who calls herself liberal.) She has responded by suggesting \\"people are just so scared of an 'other,' something that might be unknown to them and they can't see past that. So in their eyes, working for RT de-legitimizes you.\\" At the same time, when she has been denouncing very harshly Republicans and the Fox Network for having an homophobic agenda, she has refused to answer what her opinion is regarding the anti-homosexual laws passed in Russia under Vladimir Putin in 2013. Julia Ioffe in the Columbia Journalism Review described how Minkovski had attacked Glenn Beck for asking why RT was in \\"lock-step with the Obama Administration\\". Minkovski argued that Beck was \\"not on the side of America. And the fact that my channel is more honest with the American people is something you should be ashamed of.\\" Ioffe asked \\"Since when does Russia Today defend the policies of any American president?

Biography  Fenn was born in Lanesborough, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard University with an A.B. degree in 1914. His graduate work and Ph.D. thesis were interrupted by World War I, and he finished it upon return from the army in 1919. He was an instructor at Harvard Medical School from 1919 to 1923. He then studied at the Rockefeller Institute for 2 years. Subsequently, he assumed his position as the chairman of the department of physiology at the University of Rochester, where he stayed until 1959. He specialized in the physiology of runners, then in aviation, and later in space exploration. The American Physiological Society obituary described him as \\"[a] sincerely modest man [who] avoided the spotlight and never dominated a meeting or conversation, but he was forceful when required and had a warm, outgoing nature with a delightful sense of humor\\".

It is located just north of Bakersfield (specifically the Northeast region). The park is , and contains two lakes and three canals. It was named after County Supervisor John Hart, who spearheaded the project. Constructed between 1921 and 1936, it is the oldest section of the Kern River County Park. History Construction The origins of the park date back to 1921, when County Supervisor John Hart, convinced the county to purchase land along the Kern River, east of Gordon's Ferry.Gilbert P. Gia \\"One Hundred Years at Hart Park, 1890-1990\\" https://www.historicbakersfieldandkerncounty.com/community The goal was to create a large recreation park, which residents could use to escape the summer heat. Landscape architect Howard Gilkey, from Oakland, California, was hired to create the general plan for the park. Famous for designing water features, Gilkey made extensive use of the adjacent Kern River. Several canals and lakes were designed.>Lynch, George.Hart Park - In The Beginning . The Bakersfield Californian. January 4, 2008. Accessed: 12-15-2011. Construction began shortly after the property was acquired. Development proceeded slowly, since the county did not appropriate funds. Instead, Hart relied largely on private donations for materials and volunteer labor. Almost every non-profit service club would participate in the effort. Several sponsored a grove of trees, providing landscaping and irrigation. These groves were originally marked with plaques recognizing these organizations, however, years of vandalism have destroyed many of them. Although the park was laid out according to Gilkey's master plan, most of the construction work was done without formal engineering plans. Streets, lakes, canals, and buildings were instead constructed \\"by ear.\\" Several buildings from other parts of Bakersfield were also moved to the park. Because of the limited funding, one of the primary building materials used was river rocks from the Kern River Canyon (which were free). They were used in the construction of fire rings, barbecues, drinking fountains, and the double decker bandstand (with drinking fountains on the lower level). Continued development and official opening By May 5, 1929, construction of the park progressed enough that it was opened to the public. Although more work was needed before completion, it was decided to show off to the residents of Kern County the work that was accomplished. The park was named \\"Kern River Park.\\" That year, Hart and others considered establishing a museum in the park, which would showcase historical items that were collected by the local Lions Club. The Kern County Museum was finally established in 1941 to hold the collection; however, it would be located on U.S. Route 99 (Chester Avenue) in Bakersfield. The Great Depression that started in 1929 would slow donations for the park's construction. However, WPA (Works Progress Administration) funds would make up most of the difference. Kern River Park was completed on May 17, 1936. A formal ceremony was held that included speeches, races, dances, music, games, and other activities. The park contained three lakes: one for birds and other water fowl, one for rowing and paddle wheel boats, and one for swimming. In addition, there was a 2-acre swimming pool. Natural hot springs were used for a bath house. An amusement park was located on the east end of the park, which included a train and carousel. Concession booths were located at the boat lake and the amusement park. A zoo was located throughout the park. Growth and additions When traveling through the Kern River Canyon, Hart discovered an unusually shaped rock. He commented that it would make a nice addition to the Kern River Park. After his death in 1934, that rock was moved to the park and placed at the entrance to the parking lot for the swimming pool. Jack Shields Trucking donated equipment and labor for the relocation and the East Bakersfield Progressive Club, with volunteer labor, would mount it with a plaque dedicated to John Hart. It was formally dedicated on Labor Day, September 6, 1937, with a public gala to honor Hart and his efforts in the creation of the park. Ten years later, on June 15, 1947, the Kern River Park was renamed Hart Memorial Park. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, additional land was purchased east of Hart Park. This would quadruple the size from (although the new land was not then considered part of Hart Park). Called the Kern River County Park, the land would contain a motorboat lake, golf course, and campgrounds. To meet the growing demand, Alfred Harrell Highway, the road used to access the park, was upgraded to a four-lane freeway. It was also extended as a two-lane conventional highway east to SR 178 (Kern Canyon Road) with land reserved for future interchanges. Decline The park began to decline in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The exact reason for the decline is unknown although several possibilities have been proposed. Some believe the shift in development to the southwest led to the decline, others believe that growing entertainment options in the city resulted in less time spent in the park. The 1952 Kern County earthquake would eliminate the natural hot spring. Later, the zoo would close, as well as the swimming lake (water was supplied by the water wheel which was also falling into disrepair). The amusement park would close and Sniders would end their bicycle rental business. The concrete pool and the boat rentals would also close. Some of these facilities would later return in locations outside of Hart Park. The California Living Museum was established east of Hart Park and would contain a zoo. The McMurtrey Aquatic Center would replace the concrete pool, which is located in Mill Creek, Downtown Bakersfield. Amenities Hart Park is , which makes it one of the larger parks in Bakersfield. It has two lakes and three canals. There are several \\"sections\\" which can be rented for large gatherings. There are also several large fields for lawn sports, and baseball backstops.Hart Park. County of Kern Parks & Recreation. Accessed: 12-15-2011. There is one large reservable picnic area (one of two in Kern River Park). It contains: a band stand, two deep pit barbecues, two grills with 7 propane burners, food preparation tables, two booths (one for tickets and the other for drinks). The area is lit, but is not fenced.Kern River Park Group Picnic Areas. County of Kern Parks & Recreation. Accessed: 12-15-2011. There is also an equestrian trail on the north side of Hart Park. A bike path starts on the east side, and travels through the Kern River County Park, ending at the Kern River Golf Course. There are also two 18-hole disk golf courses. Many of the roads in the park are named after nearby geographic features. For example, River Road is near the Kern River, and Lake Street is near the boating lake. Some of the facilities for which roads are named no longer exist. For example, Harbor Road originally led to the harbor on the boating lake and Kiddieland Drive was next to the amusement park. Tree grove sponsors The following is a list of organizations which developed the various tree groves throughout the park. Each grove was originally marked with a bronze plaque, although most have been destroyed because of vandalism. Unconstructed additions Two facilities were planned but never constructed. Dante Cascade Waterfall On the east side, ending near Hill Street was the Dante Cascade Waterfall, to honor Dante Alighieri. The project was originally proposed by the Societa di Mutuo Soccorso of Kern County Italians. The waterfall would begin at the tallest peak next to the park. It would cascade down three levels, to symbolizes his work, The Divine Comedy. The waterfall would have also featured a bust of Dante at its base. The group started raising funds for the project in 1931. However, the great depression would greatly impact the organization's ability to raise funds. Only partial grading, which can be seen at the top of Hill Street, was completed. Kern River Bowl On the northwest corner of the park was a proposed outdoor amphitheater named the Kern County Bowl (or Kern River Bowl). Scheduled for construction in 1939, it was originally proposed by the Kern County Employees Association and quickly supported by every civic and non-profit service group in the county. The design for the theater was based on similar outdoor theater of the time such as the Hollywood Bowl. It would contain a shell, seating built into the hill side in a gentle arc, and a rustic pool/fountain separating the two. It would have been very large, with an estimated seating capacity for 20,000 people. During the 1940 census, Bakersfield had a population of 30,000 and Kern County had a population of 135,000. The project would have been constructed with WPA funds. It was submitted for the 1939/1940 fiscal year. However, because of the start of World War II, priority was given to facilities which could be used by the military such as roads and airports. Private funds were never raised and the project was indefinitely shelved. Grading for the seating was completed. The site is now occupied by the Kern County Sheriffs Shooting Range.

Prior to her career as a therapist, she was a fashion designer and photographer. During the 1980s, she earned acclaim as a makeup artist in the pop music video industry. She taught body painting at the University of the Arts London for over 20 years. Most recently (2019) Carolyn founded and launched a new form of yoga, Kundalini Global, in answer to the rapidly growing and profound need for yoga to become more inclusive and serve a wider demographic  Early years  Cowan was born in 1960, the eldest of three children of fashion photographer John Cowan and Syddy Cooper. She grew up in Chelsea, London and was exposed to fashion at a young age, often posing as a child model for her father. In 1964, her parents divorced and her mother eventually married a broker at Lloyd's who took care of the family financially. Cowan has said that the loss of her father led to depression and eventually contributed to substance abuse. During that period, John Cowan leased his studio at 39 Princes Place to Michelangelo Antonioni for interior and exterior filming of the film Blowup. His photographic murals are featured in the film. He also shot the title stills for 2001 A Space Odyssey.Staff writer. \\"On the Trail of the Swinging Sixties – 'Blow-Up', Antonioni's Cult Film, Hit Our Screens 40 Years Ago. Robert Nurden Goes in Search of the Places Used for Filming, from Notting Hill to a Neglected Park in a Little-Known Corner of South-East London\\" The Independent, 10 September 2006. From age 11 to 16, Cowan attended a Catholic boarding school, which she has called \\"a horrible experience,\\" due to the abusive staff. During that time, she would often escape to the city to take art courses at the Victoria and Albert Museum as a way \\"to get out of school.\\" When she was 16, she left school and moved to London with her then-boyfriend, music composer Hans Zimmer.  Early professional life  While in her early 20s, Cowan met members of the Italian group Krisma, a new wave band formed in 1976 with Maurizio Arcieri and Christina Moser. The lead singer of the band, Moser, allowed Cowan to paint her face for shows. Soon Cowan was doing body painting and wanted to become a makeup artist. When she was 22, she sold her clothes to buy a train ticket to Milan to pursue a career in fashion. Her first job was working for Italian Vogue. She returned to England and worked in the pop music video industry. She would eventually work with such personalities as Bryan Ferry, David Bowie and Freddie Mercury, who were part of the booming 1980s video music industry. She also worked with singer Steve Strange. Among her achievements during that time was helping Duran Duran \\"perfect their decadent, glamorous look\\" for the music video of their hit song \\"Rio\\" and travelling to the South of France to film Elton John's video for \\"I'm Still Standing\\", where \\"everyone was flying around in their own private helicopters, including me.\\"Becky Sheaves. \\"David Bowie Saved My Life!\\" The Daily Mail, 17 October 2006.  Turmoil and David Bowie's intervention  By the time Cowan was 28, her life of excess was taking a toll. She was addicted to drugs and alcohol. During the summer of 1991, while in Dublin to do David Bowie's makeup for a video, Cowan said her life changed dramatically. \\"David Bowie took one look at me, hung-over, red-eyed and incoherent, and told me I was in trouble. Cowan said Bowie encouraged her to stay sober and attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. By 31 July 1991, she had given up smoking, drugs and alcohol and changed her line of work and focused on photography. During a 2011 interview, Cowan said that people sometimes need to reach a point of no return to grow and change. \\"Unless you hit something like depression, illness, death or addiction there is no change. The moment you jump off that metaphorical cliff into the darkness you can always recognize other people who have done the same.\\"  Photography  During the early 1990s, Cowan began a career as a photographer. Among her first jobs was an Ilford Photo-sponsored trip to India to photograph nomads. While there, she was exposed to Hindu spirituality and Sikhism, which would later fuel her passion for yoga and meditation. \\"I preferred this idea of choosing your experiences and transformation, that you can have all your past and drama and that could be your mountain on which you stand. Like the root of a tree that you become.\\" Cowan has been acclaimed for her photography, which includes nudes and family portraits. “Today we are so defined by the exterior, labels and what we wear. Clothes hide and mask who we really are. But if you take it away we are nothing else but ourselves. I am fascinated by bodies, regardless one being skinny, not skinny, fat, obese, wrinkled, aged or young. There is beauty in absolutely everything, even in a nude body, which is not perfect as none of us are. There is beauty in human vulnerability.\\" In her photography, Cowan said she strives to show the \\"magical spark\\" inside her subjects. \\"When I take a picture of someone it is always about redemption, a way of liberation if you prefer.\\"  Psychosexual and Yoga Teacher  Cowan's professional life is now largely focused on her work as a psychosexual and relationship therapist. She is a member of the College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists (COSRT) and accredited with the National Counselling Society (NCS). She works in all manners of addictive behaviours and sexual dysfunction, including working with same-sex couples, pre- and post-natal relationships, and sexual issues. Cowan is one of a growing number of sex therapists who do not believe in the traditional concept of sexual addiction. Going against current assumptions and trends, she debunks the idea that sex addiction is real. Instead, she says, the current concept of \\"sex addiction\\" is a belief system, supported by faith, moral conviction and religious principles, that represents an attack on sexuality and its expression. It was originally devised, as a system, in the 1980s during the AIDS crisis, and does not support recovery from trauma, an abusive background, mental illness, etc. in its concepts and applications, she says. Cowan believes that labeling behaviors as sex addiction asserts a false, dangerous myth that undermines personal responsibility. Cowan is also an international Kundalini yoga teacher. She said she discovered yoga in India and is heavily inspired by Hindu spirituality. During an interview with British Vogue, Cowan said, \\"yoga builds confidence, connections and friendships. It eases loneliness, gives you faith in yourself. By attending a regular class, you join a community and a worldwide tribe; with yoga as a part of your focus you can go on to train as a teacher, empowering yourself and changing the lives of others.\\" In 2019, she was named among the top 16 yoga teachers in London. In addition to her therapy practice, she also provides training for the treatment of drug and alcohol addiction as well as sexual compulsion, compulsive porn, shopping, gambling and cutting through her Mastering the Addictive Personality Teacher Training course, which certifies the practitioner to work in prisons and rehab centers. Cowan explores addiction and anxiety through the lens of trauma, shame and abuse rather than the widely accepted 21-step disease model. Her other workshops focus on topics such as shame, the anatomy of posture and hormones, female arousal and menopause. Cowan has produced numerous DVDs about vegetarian cooking, conscious pregnancy, overcoming addictive personalities and the art of meditation. She was also a contributor for TabooZapp, an app that is designed to support mental health, identity, well-being and confidence in youth. She is currently preparing to self publish a new book on Kundalini Global. She has contributed her expertise to a variety of magazines and digital outlets including The Guardian, Cosmopolitan Magazine, Glamour Magazine, Psychologies, Women’s Health, The Sun (United Kingdom), i news, Natural Health Magazine, and Woman’s Own. She has also has written feature articles in Planet Mindful and Yoga magazines about Kundalini yoga and menopause.  Kundalini Global  In 2019, Carolyn founded Kundalini Global in answer to the rapidly growing demand for yoga to become more inclusive and serve a wider demographic, and after she stepped away from Kundalini yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan in 2014. As well as teaching Kundalini Global classes, in 2020 Carolyn began offering Kundalini Global teacher training. Kundalini Global and its teachers adhere to the view that yoga has the power to deal with anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, negative history and physical responses to trauma in the body.

The game takes place during the 1996 Major League Baseball season. Rosters and statistics are accurate as of the 1995 Major League Baseball season. Reception MLB Pennant Race experienced exceptionally long delays, and some critics felt that it greatly suffered as a result, being a game with 1995 stats released when the 1996 MLB season was over. Other common criticisms were the slowness of the games and scorekeeper bugs such as counting swung-on strikes as balls. However, reviewers complimented the large selection of options and modes and the easy, accurate batting interface and controls. Opinions varied concerning the graphics; Hugh Sterbakov of GameSpot said they were excellent, a reviewer for Next Generation said they fell short of the competition, and Air Hendrix of GamePro said he personally felt they were not as good as polygonal graphics, but that they were done well for what they were and that those who like 2D graphics would enjoy them. Overall opinions of the game also varied. Todd Mowatt of Electronic Gaming Monthly said it was \\"a lot of fun to play\\", while his co-reviewer Joe Rybicki found it lacking and said gamers should rent it first. The reviewer for Next Generation concluded that its late release and inferior gameplay and graphics compared to the competition made it not worth getting. IGN criticized the game as being dated, specifically interface elements such as the batting cursor. Sterbakov said it was a mixed bag, but that some players would find its good points appealing and be able to overlook its negative points.

She graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1900, with majors in zoology and geology. During college, she spent her summers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Ogilvie was one of the first students of Florence Bascom, who set a generation of women from Bryn Mawr onto careers in geology. After a year of graduate work at the University of Chicago where she worked with the geomorphologist Rollin D. Salisbury, she earned a Ph.D. in 1903 at Columbia University, where her advisor was the petrologist James Furman Kemp. Professional career and scholarship Upon earning her Ph.D. Ogilvie was hired by Barnard College, where she served as lecturer or instructor until she was made assistant professor in 1912, associate professor in 1916, and full professor in 1938. Following in the footsteps of Florence Bascom, who founded the Geology program at Bryn Mawr, Ogilvie's hiring at Barnard began one of the few geology programs at elite women's colleges, as did Elizabeth F. Fisher at Wellesley College and Mignon Talbot at Mount Holyoke College. Ogilvie's dissertation was the geologic mapping of the Paradox Lake Quadrangle in the Adirondack Mountains of New York. Fifteen-minute quadrangle maps were only just becoming available for this part of the United States, and hers was the first quadrangle report on rocks from the Adirondacks published by the New York State Museum in 1905. Ogilvie published papers on both on glacial and bedrock geology topics. Her interest in teaching at the graduate level at Columbia University, and keeping an affiliation with that department apparently encouraged her focus on the glacial topics–without a glacial specialist at that time the Columbia faculty was happy to have her teach the graduate glacial Geology course. Columbia students attended her course at Barnard, and she was the first woman teaching Geology at the graduate level at a major university (probably beginning in 1912-1913)^. Beginning in 1917 Ogilvie became involved in the Women's Land Army, a civilian effort to encourage women's participation in farming during World War I's wartime shortage in male labor on the home front. Ogilvie was initially brought into the project by Delia West Marble, a member of the Garden Club of America, beginning their lifetime working and romantic partnership^. Marble later would later become the curator of the Barnard Geology collection, and would be remembered as a formidable presence in the department. Ogilvie toured the country for the Land Army, attending college campuses to generate interest in the program, and directed almost 150 women at ‘Bedford Camp’, the Marble family farm in Westchester County, NY. After the war had ended 20 of the women continued on at the Marble family farm. After World War I Ogilvie was not an active researcher, focusing on managing the farm, teaching, and mentoring students. She was a fellow of the Geological Society of America, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the New York Academy of Sciences, and member of several other scientific societies. Ogilvie retired from teaching in 1941.

Early life and education  Born in Bogotá, Colombia, Barrera moved to the United States at the age of eight, growing up in Thousand Oaks, California. He trained with Sheffield United F.C. as a teen. He developed his game in the United States both with the US Soccer residency program and at the high school level with Westlake High School, where he skipped his senior year of high school. He was named as a Parade magazine All- American and regarded as one of the top recruits coming out of high school. RiseMag.com listed Barrera as the #1 recruit in his class. He attended the University of California, Santa Barbara where he was a student-athlete and played college soccer with the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos men's soccer team from 2008 to 2010. He would appear for the team in 66 games, scoring 10 goals and adding 22 assists. He left UCSB after his junior year to pursue a professional career.  Club career  While still attending college, Barrera played with the newly formed PDL team Ventura County Fusion in the summers, alongside his brother Diego Barrera. For the 2009 PDL season, Barrera and Ventura County Fusion beat Chicago Fire Premier for the league championship. Over 4 seasons, he appeared in 39 games for Ventura County, scoring 13 goals and 15 assists. After being named to the 2011 PDL season All-League Team, Barrera signed with Serbian SuperLiga side FK Spartak Subotica (for sponsorship reasons the name was FK Spartak Zlatibor Voda that season) in August 2011 after a successful trial. He made his debut for Spartak against FK Borac Čačak on December 10, 2011. Barrera returned to the United States in 2012 and re-joined Ventura County Fusion and appeared in 6 games, but played for Cal FC in their historic 2012 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup run coached by Eric Wynalda. In July, Barrera signed with Atlanta Silverbacks. He was the first signing of new Silverbacks head coach Eric Wynalda, who had just been appointed some days earlier. Wynalda, who coached Barrera at Cal FC, had previously stated that he's wanted Barrera playing for his team since 2010 when he first saw Barrera playing in Santa Barbara. In August 2012, Barrera joined English Football League Championship side Derby County F.C. on trial, where he featured in preseason friendlies against Belper Town F.C., Chesterfield F.C., and Matlock Town F.C.. He would return to Atlanta after the trial proved unsuccessful. Barrera joined San Antonio Scorpions ahead of the 2014 North American Soccer League season. He was traded later that season to Carolina RailHawks for César Elizondo. At the conclusion of the season, Barrera re-joined Cal FC for their 2015 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup run. Barrera joined Sacramento Republic FC in June 2015. He was re-signed by Sacramento for the 2016 USL season.

He supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. Origins Pollard was the eldest son and heir of Sir Lewis Pollard, 1st Baronet (d.1641) of King's Nympton, Devonshire, by his wife Margaret Berkeley, daughter of Sir Henry Berkeley, Knight, of Bruton, Somerset.Vivian, Lt.Col. J.L., (Ed.) The Visitations of the County of Devon: Comprising the Heralds' Visitations of 1531, 1564 & 1620, Exeter, 1895, p.598, Pollard pedigree Career He joined the army and by 1639 was a captain engaged in raising troops in Devon for the Scottish wars. The following year he was ordered to Scotland and was probably present at the Battle of Newburn. Civil War In November 1640 Pollard was elected Member of Parliament for Bere Alston in the Long Parliament.Helms & Ferris He became involved in the Royalist army plots of 1641 and, after being found guilty of misprision, was expelled from the House of Commons. He succeeded to the baronetcy that same year. During the Civil war Pollard mainly served with the king's army in Devonshire and Cornwall and in 1645 was made governor of Dartmouth. Fairfax's Parliamentary troops besieged the town in January 1645/6 and Pollard was captured and held prisoner until 1646. In 1653 he was fined £518 for his \\"delinquency\\". It may have been the severity of this fine which caused him to sell to his cousin Sir Arthur Northcote, 2nd Baronet (1628–1688) the manor of King's Nympton in Devon, purchased as his seat by his great-great-great grandfather Sir Lewis Pollard (c. 1465-1526), of Grilstone, Bishop's Nympton, Justice of the Common Pleas and MP for Totnes. Restoration After the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 Pollard was elected MP for the Cornish seat and Rolle family pocket borough of Callington in a by-election to the Convention Parliament. No doubt this was due to the Rolle influence exerted by Pollard's second wife Mary Stevens (d.1669), widow of Henry Rolle (1605-1647) of Stevenstone. He was appointed a JP, a Deputy Lieutenant, and Vice Admiral of Devon. In 1661 he was elected MP for Devon in the Cavalier Parliament, with as his co-MP Sir John Rolle (d.1706), KB, the cousin and heir of Henry Rolle (d.1647). He was appointed in 1661 Governor of Guernsey and in 1662 Comptroller of the Royal Household and a Privy Councillor. Marriages and children Pollard married twice: * Firstly to Lady Bridget de Vere (1584-1631), a daughter of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford (1550-1604) and widow of Francis Norris, 1st Earl of Berkshire (1579-1622). By her he left an only daughter, Bridget Pollard.Vivian, p.598 * Secondly to Mary Stevens (1619-1669), a daughter of William Stevens (d.1648) of Great Torrington, and widow of Henry Rolle (1605-1647) of Beam near Great Torrington who inherited in 1638 the vast estate of Stevenstone near Great Torrington. William Stevens was the founder of the Devon branch of the influential Stevens family of Vielstone in the parish of Buckland Brewer, of Cross in Little Torrington and of Winscott in Peters Marland. The Cornish seat of Callington was controlled by the Rolle family and it must have been due to the influence of his second wife Mary Stevens that Pollard was elected to that seat in 1660. Mary Stevens was buried at St Giles in the Wood, the parish church of Stevenstone.Vivian, p.653, pedigree of Rolle Death and burial Pollard died on 27 November 1666 at Whitehall at the age of about 63 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Succession On his death without male progeny the baronetcy passed to his younger brother Sir Amyas Pollard, 3rd Baronet (1616-1701), of Abbots Bickington, Devon. Due to the debts built up by Sir Hugh, largely from his lavish entertaining, much apparently on government business, his brother inherited very little of the ancient family estateBurke, A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Extinct and Dormant Baronetcies and almost immediately had to sell the family manor of King's Nympton. Upon the death of Sir Amyas unmarried and without legitimate male heir, the baronetcy became extinct. Sources * Helms, M. W., & Ferris, John.

The camp was established on July 10, 1866, just upstream from the mouth of the Judith River by the 13th Infantry Regiment. By 1867 Camp Cooke had a strength of approximately 400 men. The army established the post to protect steamboat traffic en route to Fort Benton. The boats carried passengers and freight to supply swiftly growing boom towns at the site of rich gold strikes in the western mountains of the Montana Territory. The location of the fort was along the upper Missouri River as it crossed the broad eastern plains of Montana, far from the gold camps and boom towns in southwest Montana. The fort was also located deep in the remote badlands, called the Missouri Breaks, which parallels the Missouri River for hundreds of miles. Once the fort was constructed the garrison had little to do. Except for the high water months of May, June and July, Missouri River steamboat traffic was limited. As a result, soldiers were dispatched from Camp Cooke to other more strategic locations in the Montana Territory. Detachments from Camp Cooke guarded major transportation routes in Southwestern Montana, including the roads between Fort Benton and Helena. They built Fort Shaw along that route in 1867 in the Sun River Valley. Other detachments from Camp Cooke built Fort Ellis near Bozeman, Montana in the upper Gallatin Valley, which guarded the critical east-west over land route over Bozeman Pass. Camp Cooke was abandoned less than four years after it was built on March 31, 1870, in response to constant well-founded complaints that the location of the post was too remote. Purpose of Camp Cooke The purpose of Camp (Fort) Cooke was to provide protection to Missouri River traffic and settlers in the Montana Territory who were traveling up the Missouri to the goldfields. Following the gold strikes at Bannack, 1862 (Grasshopper Gulch); Virginia City, 1863 (Alder Gulch); Helena, 1864 (Prickly Pear Creek and Last Chance Gulch); and the spectacular gold strikes in 1865 at the Montana Bar and other sites in Confederate Gulch, immigrants poured into the Montana Territory. The gold fields were in southwestern Montana, in the intermontane valleys. The immigrants had to cross the extensive eastern Montana plains, to reach the gold fields. The primary access route to the gold fields was up the Missouri River by steamboat to the head of navigation at Fort Benton. A secondary route for overland travelers was over the Bozeman Trail which branched off from the Oregon Trail in Wyoming Territory, skirted the eastern edge of the Big Horn Mountains after which the trail continued up the Yellowstone River valley to reach the Montana goldfields via the Bozeman Pass. Settlers and miners traveling to the Montana goldfields crossed territory that Indian tribes considered theirs. These lands were occupied by the Blackfoot, Gros Ventre, Assiniboine, Lakota Sioux, Northern Cheyenne, and Crow tribes. The Missouri River steamboats and the resulting freight routes fanning out from the Missouri River, and the overland immigrant trains coming up the Bozeman Trail, drove off the buffalo and other game on which the Indian depended. In reaction, the Indians retaliated by mounting small scale, scattered, guerrilla type attacks and raids. The Indians attacked steamboats and freight wagons. They attacked parties of overland immigrant and mail carriers. They stole livestock and killed travelers and settlers as opportunity presented. First army post in Montana Territory As reports of thefts of livestock and killings by Indians accumulated, the newspapers that had sprung up in the swiftly growing mining and trading communities of the Montana Territory demanded that the U.S. Army provide protection. Petitions and letters went east to Washington. In response the army established Camp Cooke on the Missouri River in the Montana Territory on July 10, 1866. To protect the Bozeman Trail, the army had established forts in Dakota Territory at Fort Reno (1865) and Fort Phil Kearny (1866). On August 12, 1866, the army established Fort C.F. Smith on the Big Horn River just inside the boundary of Montana Territory. Thus, by the narrow margin of one month, Camp Cooke became the first U.S. Army post in the Montana Territory. Naming Camp Cooke Camp Cooke was named in honor of Brig. Gen. Philip St. George Cooke. In 1866 he was in command of the Department of the Platte, which then included the Montana Territory. Locating Camp Cook Inspector General D.B. Sackett was sent to Montana to select a site for the military outpost to protect the traffic on the Missouri River. The logical site was Ft. Benton, the head of navigation on the Missouri River. However Sackett judged that Ft. Benton had sufficient resources to defend itself, and the considered the area lacked materials for the construction of a post, and also lacked sufficient range for the maintenance of its livestock. He recommended a site at the mouth of the Musselshell River, where a small community existed. As an alternative Sackett suggested the mouth of the Judith River. Remote location of Camp Cooke The Montana Territory gold strikes were located in the intermontane valley region of southwestern Montana, far removed from Camp Cooke. Camp Cooke was in the broad-reaching eastern plains of Montana. Geographically the post was isolated from the western part of the territory. Further, the post was located deep within a several hundred mile stretch of the Missouri River known as the Missouri Breaks, which are steeply eroded badlands bordering the river and separating it from the surrounding eastern Montana plains. Protect river traffic Camp Cooke was located on the south side of the Missouri River, just upstream from the mouth of the Judith River. This location was along the Missouri River, a major artery of commerce from the early 1860s to the late 1880s. In this period steamboats brought traffic and passengers to Fort Benton in the Montana Territory. Fort Benton was the head of Missouri River navigation in the Montana Territory. However steamboat traffic on this section of the Missouri was limited to a few months of \\"high water\\", which occurred when seasonal runoff of snow melt from the prairies and mountains of Montana made upriver steamboat navigation to Fort Benton possible. Except for the months of May, June and July, steamboat traffic was virtually nonexistent. Downstream from Camp Cooke was the Dauphine Rapids, which were difficult-to- impossible to traverse after the river began to fall after the spring floods. During low water season on the Missouri, most freight and passengers were offloaded down stream from Camp Cooke, at Cow Island and carried by freight wagon to Fort Benton. These freight routes did not pass close to Camp Cooke. Abandonment of Camp Cooke Because of its isolation Camp Cooke was abandoned on 31 March 1870, although a rapidly growing infestation of rats at the post helped prompt the decision. Visiting the Site of Camp Cooke The Missouri Breaks have resisted settlement and so the site of Camp Cooke remains remote to this day. The site cannot be easily visited. It can be reached by canoeing/floating down the river through the Missouri Breaks, in the section now designated a wild and scenic river and part of the Missouri Breaks National Monument. The site of Camp Cooke is located at River Mile 86.8 Right. Today there are only the foundations of some of the buildings and the usual rubble that remains after buildings were taken away, torn down or simply deteriorated and fell in on themselves.

Early life Beebe grew up in Walla Walla, Washington and played two years football at Walla Walla Community College before getting a scholarship. In 1979 he received a Bachelors from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona where he was team captain on their football team. In 1982 he graduated from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. Southern Methodist University case His first job out of school was working in enforcement of NCAA rules from 1982 to 1986. He was assistant director of athletics at Wichita State University from 1986 to 1987. In 1987 he was named director of enforcement for the NCAA with his most notable case being the imposition of the \\"death penalty\\" against Southern Methodist University in the Southern Methodist University football scandal. From 1989 to 2003, he was commissioner of the Ohio Valley Conference. Big 12 In 2003 he joined the Big 12 as senior associate commissioner and chief operating officer. On September 5, 2007, he was promoted to commissioner. Beebe had a stormy relationship at the Big 12 helm as the University of Nebraska moved to the Big Ten Conference and University of Colorado moved to the Pac-12 Conference at the end of the 2010-11 season. Then Texas A&M; University and the University of Missouri announced in the fall of 2011 that they were moving to the SEC Conference at the end of the 2011-12 season. The moves ended a 100+ year relationship of Missouri and Nebraska to the conference as well as ended a 100+ year rivalry between Texas A&M; and the University of Texas. The Missouri and Texas A&M; departures had been stirred by a University of Texas deal with ESPN to broadcast games on the Longhorn Network which was valued at $300 million over 25 years. The departures of Nebraska and Colorado, which destabilized the conference the previous year, were no small factor either. Texas also said it would broadcast high school highlights (which other schools felt would put them at a disadvantage when recruiting future players) and Texas initially indicated it would not share revenue from the deal with its fellow conference members. The NCAA ruled that televising potential recruits' games would not be allowed before this could be done. Texas had been talking about such an arrangement since 2007. After schools, in particular the University of Oklahoma and its president David Boren, urged his ouster for not doing enough to smooth school concerns, he was ousted on September 23, 2011. Beebe said that he had proposed equal revenue distribution in the conference as early as 2008 but that the conference had not voted on it. Further he noted he had negotiated a 13-year $1 billion deal with Fox Sports.

The term connotes not just the mere existence of child poverty but the increase in both relative and absolute measures of poverty among children as compared to both other vulnerable groups and the population at large. Academic study of the juvenilization of poverty attempts to explain the methodical ways in which children are systematically disenfranchised by institutions, government welfare spending, and opportunities for health and wellness. Research also connects the juvenilization of poverty to overall trends in family structures, parental work, and economic supports for children and families. In particular, the juvenilization of poverty is closely linked to the \\"feminization of poverty\\", or the ways in which women worldwide are also disproportionately affected by poverty. Both terms – \\"juvenilization\\" and \\"feminization\\" – have been contested in political and academic discourse.  History of the term  In the 1980s scholars and practitioners in the fields of public administration, sociology, and social work began noting a distressingly rapid rise in rates of juvenile poverty. This, after several decades of falling child poverty rates, with a low of about 15% in 1974, signaled to many a possible reversal in the gains made during the 1960s and 1970s for children's wellness. U.S. birth rate 1934–2004 A central aspect of concern was that juvenile poverty was rising in two-parent and single-parent mother homes, contrary to the perceived inherent stability of two-parent families. A 1989 article by Mary Jo Bane and David Ellwood linked changes in the labor market and declining male wages to rising child poverty trends, leading to further investigations of the connections between work, family structures, social services spending, and childhood welfare. A population pyramid that shows the age of the population by sex from 1950 to 2010. Also notable regarding the rise in juvenile poverty was the concurrent decrease in the rates of poverty among other vulnerable or \\"dependent\\" populations, specifically the elderly. In 1984 demographer Samuel Preston reported on several statistics that should have counter-indicated these trends. First a \\"sharp fertility decline\\" in the two decades after the 1957 postwar peak, matched with a \\"a very rapid decline in old age mortality\\", should have indicated \\"favorable consequences for children and troubling ones for the elderly. In fact, he writes, :My thesis is that exactly the opposite trends have occurred in the relative well being of our two groups of age dependents and that demographic factors have not only failed to prevent this outcome but have, in many ways, encouraged it. Conditions have deteriorated for children and improved dramatically for the elderly... thumb Considering these shifts and anomalous patterns of prosperity, the term \\"juvenilization of poverty\\" was coined to give name to the growing understanding the poverty was being increasingly and systematically born by children. The term, in both scholarship and practice, is used to elucidate ways in which children, even in times of economic gains and despite evidence seemingly to the contrary, are at a disproportionate risk of living in poverty.  Trends in child poverty up to 2010  Child poverty in the United States has fluctuated dramatically over time, usually in response to large-scale economic and political events. Estimates of juvenile poverty during the Great Depression judge that as many as 7 in 10 children, or 70% of all Americans under the age of 18, lived in poverty. The economic recovery afforded by World War II and post-war prosperity dramatically reduced both the number and percent of children living in impoverished homes. Until the early 1960s however, no official, formalized national attempt was made to measure a standard poverty rate. In 1963, however, analyst Mollie Orshansky, a Social Security Administration researcher, worked to develop an official poverty threshold to standardize poverty measures. Trends in Child Poverty Rates in the US, 1959-2009 Still used today, the Orshansky Poverty Threshold is an absolute measure of poverty that uses as its basis a \\"minimally adequate food budget\\" for families of varying sizes, estimating that food costs required approximately one-third of a family's after-tax budget. Thus a family (of three or more) fell below the poverty threshold if their after-tax income is less than three times the \\"minimally adequate food budget\\". Despite some changes to the formula, this measure remains at the center of the official measures of absolute poverty. Orshansky's calculations determined that in 1960 just under 30% of children lived in poverty. This rate continued to decline throughout the 1960s and 1970s due to a combination of economic growth, strong social welfare spending, and a robust labor market that increasingly included working mothers. Overall rates of child poverty reached a low in 1974 at, according to varying estimates, between 8-15%. However, in the last third of the 20th century child poverty rates among single parent (usually only a mother) and two-parent families began to surge. This generally positive history of child poverty in the first two thirds of the 20th century belies, however, the variability of poverty rates for different subpopulations of children. Juvenile poverty varied both geographically and by racial subgroups. Despite overall gains, children of color were far more likely than White children to live in poverty. Certain regions, especially the south and some urban centers, also experienced high rates of concentrated poverty. Child Poverty Rates, by Race/Ethnicity 1959-2010 Many of the causes for the juvenilization of poverty follow highly racialized affect patterns, meaning children of color are far more likely to suffer from poverty, both in the United States and internationally. Suzanne Bianchi finds that \\"between 1960 and 1991, the proportion of children living in mother-only families increased from 8 percent to 26 percent. The rise among black children living in mother- only families was much more pronounced than for white children. By 1991, 54 percent of black compared with 17 percent of white children lived only with their mother\\" (Bianchi 1991). According to the most recent statistics from the National Center for Children in Poverty (NCCP) at Columbia University, about 51 million children, or 21% of the juvenile population of the United States, live \\"in families with incomes below the federal poverty level – $22,050 a year for a family of four\\".Federal Poverty Guidelines: http://www.nccp.org/publications/images/mip08_fig1.jpg The United States is one of the only nations that uses an absolute measure to determine poverty rates. In Europe and elsewhere best practices indicate that a relative measure of poverty is the best indicator of both proportional deprivation and comparable quality of life. Using a relative measure of poverty is considered a more accurate way of determining the economic stability of a group relative to both the general population and other comparable subpopulations. Using a relative measure to determine juvenile poverty rates requires setting a cutoff point – 60%, 50%, or 40% are standard measures – of average income, at which point a child or family is classified as poor. Relative measures of child poverty show that an even higher percentage of children in the US are impoverished, deepening the juvenilization of poverty. The NCCP also writes that \\"Research shows, on average, families need an income of about twice that level to cover basic expenses. Using this standard, 42% of children live in low-income families\\". According to the most recent statistics from the National Center for Children in Poverty (NCCP) at Columbia University, about 51 million children, or 21% of the juvenile population of the United States, live \\"in families with incomes below the federal poverty level – $22,050 a year for a family of four\\". Using these calculations, the number of children currently living in poverty in the United States is between 1:5 and 2:5 children. A recent analysis of the 2010 US Census found that the number of poor children rose by 1 million in 2010, with nearly 1:5 American children now living in poverty. Either statistic, say advocates of child welfare, is far too high. They point to histories of the past 50 years and especially the past 20 years and make the claim that even in good economic eras and especially in bad ones, the effects of poverty have been disproportionately transferred to children.  Controversies  However, there is also a body of scholarship in response that questions the validity of these terms, finding that there has been neither an increase in women/child poverty nor a systematic project to transfer poverty to these populations. In particular, conservative researchers have argued that mismeasurement, inaccurate calculations, and inherent flaws in poverty data collection have overstated both child poverty rates and the juvenilization of poverty. Susan Mayer and Christopher Jencks write: > :After a century of fairly steady decline, the official poverty rate among > American children increased from 14.0 percent in 1969 to 19.6 percent in > 1989, suggesting that the United States was losing its war on poverty. But > once we correct various defects in the official poverty measure, our best > estimate is that the proportion of children in households with incomes below > the poverty line probably fell between 1969 and 1989 or between 1967 and > 1991. These scholars point instead to changes in family structures that have economic implications and welfare spending that attempts to ameliorate or offset poverty's effects. They cite increase access to medical care, improved living conditions, and higher percentages of children living in lower-crime areas as evidence that juvenile poverty is actually easing, rather than increasing.  Causes of child poverty  The theory of a \\"juvenilization of poverty\\" rests on a notion that juvenile poverty is not just (too) high but increasing. Several categories of trends are cited as responsible for the systematic increase in juvenile poverty.  Changes in family structures  Social scientists frequently point to changes in family structure as one of the primary forces driving juvenile poverty. Of particular note are the increasing number of children living in unmarried or single-mother households. This factor is one of the reasons why the juvenilization of poverty is so closely linked to discussions of female poverty. The rapid changes in family structure that began to occur in the 1960s and throughout the latter half of the 20th century had dramatic impacts on the financial realities of many women and children. During World War II and the decades succeeding it, many more women entered the workforce, divorce rates increased rapidly, and birth rates decreased. These shifts were both reactions to and reflections of massive shifts in the American economic, social, and cultural landscapes. Studies show that single-parent households are far more likely to subsist below the poverty line. Some estimates say that children living in single parents homes are as much as four times as likely to live in poverty.http://www.unicef- irc.org/publications/pdf/repcard1e.pdf Single parents must often support children on only one salary and must do so without the logistical and emotional support of another adult. Even when absent parents (in most cases, fathers) do pay child support, that income is less than what it would be if the parent was living with the family. As cases of single parent families rise, without commensurate increases in social welfare spending it is clearly predictable that more children will live in poverty. Scholars of juvenile poverty are interested in not just the increase in single-mother homes but the changing demographics of single mothers and the implications this has for their children's welfare. In the decades between 1960 and the end of the 20th century not only were more single women heading families but the population demographics of those women was shifting rapidly. In the 1960–70s single mothers were far likelier to be older, divorced or widowed, and at least high school graduate with some work experience. As the century came to a close the age of single mothers was trending downwards, as were their levels of education and work experience. Single mothers were also increasingly more likely to be never-married. These statistics are especially predictive of juvenile poverty because never-married mothers, as compared to divorced or separated mothers, are frequently dependent on both family and social welfare; live in higher poverty, more disadvantaged neighborhoods; and are more likely to be unemployed or lacking in job skills. These trends indicate higher levels of poverty for a growing number of single mothers and, by extension, their children. The scholarly and media attention paid to single mothers, in particular, has several implications. The first, and perhaps most politically charged, is the scrutiny placed on single mothers and their perceived failings as parents. Single mothers have been scrutinized both morally and economically, especially as the trends in \\"single\\" status changed over time. At the middle of the 20th century, the majority of single mothers were widowed while a small number were divorced or never-married. In the 1960s and 70s the number of divorced single parents rose exponentially. And throughout the last decades of the 20th century the number of never married mothers also continued to grow. Never-married single mothers, in particular, have been pathologized and their high rates of poverty seen by conservative forces as a product of their immorality and rejection of traditional family norms. This characterization is at the heart of pejorative labels like \\"welfare queen\\" that dominated political discussions of social spending and welfare programs for single mothers. Of very real concern, however, is the high rate of poverty experienced by children of never-married mothers. Bianchi writes that \\"two- thirds of children with a never-married mother live in poverty\\" (p. 100).  Changes in social welfare spending  At the same time that family dynamics in the United States were undergoing rapid and dramatic changes, so too was the social safety net changing in substantive ways. These changes are at the root, many believe, of the systematic project of transference of poverty onto families and children. The social safety or welfare net is a patchwork of programs funded and administered by the jumbled forces of federal, state, local, and private or non-profit agencies. Thus far from being monolithic or unitary, the landscape of social programs is defined by loopholes, gaps in coverage, and conflicting or contradictory regulations. Social safety net programs in the past 50 years have undergone changes in not just content but also type. The biggest shifts have been those that determine who receives support from the program. This involves both demographics (children, adults, seniors) and eligibility requirements. Eligibility for welfare programs can take many forms. In the simplest, all children would be eligible, by virtue of their age. This is the case with public school, for example. A more strenuous requirement is demonstrated need, as in the case with \\"transfer\\" benefits like welfare, Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF), food stamps, or housing subsidies. Welfare reform during the Clinton Administration drastically altered the nature and extent of federal cash assistance to needy families. The central piece of legislative reform, known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, instituted work requirement (or \\"workfare\\") and limited short term and lifetime benefits. The result was many more parents, primarily single mothers, pushed into low-wage work. In addition to the fundamental changes instituted to the distribution of cash assistance welfare, there has also been a sow but steady decline in their actual worth, as welfare assistance packages are not pegged to inflation or cost of living indexes. Finally, of great concern in the juvenilization of poverty is the state (or in many cases, failure) of private transfers, mainly through child support. In her seminal 1978 work on the feminization of poverty Diane Pearce suggests that one of the primary causes of the feminization of poverty (and, by extension, juvenilization of poverty) is the failure of formal and informal mechanisms to insure reliable private transfers of support to mothers and children. Absent fathers earn less, on average, than present fathers and contribute far less to the support of dependent children.  Changes in labor markets  Of particular concern to those who study the juvenilization of poverty has been the rapid Of particular concern to those who study the juvenilization of poverty has been the rapid of poverty in two- parent homes. Two main issues – employment and wages – seem to be driving poverty for two-parent families, even in cases where both parents are employed. Changes in the labor market have eliminated whole industries of labor, manufacturing, production jobs, often the type previously held by working-class parents. Low- or semi-skilled workers were hit hardest by the labor market restructuring of the 1970s and 1980s. Declining rates of unionization, lowered benefits, and fewer workplace compensations have had real effects in creating poor families. Because of both the insufficient quantity of low-wage jobs and the failure of real wages to keep pace with inflation and rising living costs, many of these parents are among the ranks of the working poor. The risk of juvenile poverty is especially high for children of lower-educated, lower-skilled parents. There is additional evidence to suggest that this situation is steadily worsening especially for young families and those in the bottom economic quintile. thumb The scholarly and political emphasis on single motherhood often obscures discussion of the poverty that exists in two-parent families. While poverty is quite high in single-mother families, and seemingly quite persistent, poverty in two-parent homes is both prevalent and especially reactive to cycles and trends in the larger economy. Bane and Ellwood focus on this particular issue, writing that there is \\"a much lower, but highly variable, poverty rate among children in two-parent homes\\". (p. 1048) They write that industry changes and stagnant (low) real wages, rather than unemployment, lead to poverty in two-parent households. They raise the additional concern that financial stress may lead to the breakup of marriages and thus the deepening of child poverty.  Long term effects  Material deprivation can have serious, lasting effects on children who grow up experiencing prolonged or periodic episodes of poverty. These effects may be seen both during their juvenile development and in their lives as adults. There is a strong body of research that juvenile poverty has serious consequences for academic achievement. New research just released found that the achievement gap between poor and affluent families is actually greater than that between Whites and Blacks. Research suggests that many of the \\"out of school\\" factors associated with poverty have significant effects on daily classroom performance and overall educational attainment. It has also been shown that poor children lose time more over summer breaks when more affluent peers are traveling or involved in cultural enrichment activities. Physically, poor children have far poorer health outcomes. Poor children are at a higher risk of low birthweight are more likely to die during the first month of their lives. Poor children are at far greater risk of going without health insurance and experience higher prevalence of chronic illness, lead poisoning and other environmental toxins, and accidental injury or death. Many poor children, especially infants, live in households that are \\"food insecure\\". Low access to proper and sufficient nutrition can lead to both impaired development and, perversely, obesity and a number of other weight- related illnesses such as type-2 diabetes. Some findings indicate that poor children, particularly Mexican-American children, are especially prone to low stature and higher rates of over-weight and obesity. Low birth-weight and malnutrition during childhood have been linked to low IQ, a higher prevalence of learning disabilities, and other social behavioral problems. With regard to risking behaviors like youth sexual activity, smoking, and drug/alcohol use, there is some disagreement about the negative effects of juvenile impoverishment. One 1998 study found that \\"low income was not significant in increasing youth sexual activity and actually decreased the likelihood of youth drug and/or alcohol problems\\" but that spending time with fathers and parental oversight were correlated with reductions in both types of risk behaviors. Other studies indicate that poor youth are at a much higher risk for teen childbrearing, less positive peer relationships, and lower self- esteem. Childhood poverty also has long term economic consequences. Research finds that children who experienced persistent poverty were far more likely to be poor adults than their non-poor peers. This childhood effect is not constant, however. Studies find that 33% of Black children who were poor during childhood remained so at ages 25–27, as compared with just 7% of White children.  Anti-poverty programs for children  Research shows that there are some factors – both systematic programs and large cultural shifts – that may slow or ameliorate the juvenilization and feminization of poverty. Martha Ozawa finds that children benefit far more from means-tested, non-cash transfers such as Medicaid, food stamps, housing/rent subsidies, and free or reduced-price lunch. Children also benefit to a certain degree from means- testing cash transfers like Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), other public assistance payments, and certain veteran's benefits that may \\"trickle down\\" to the child from their parent or guardian. One major factor, however, in the juvenilization of poverty has been the shift in the type of benefits regularly available to the poor in the US. Since the mid-1970s the federal government has been increasingly shifting funding from public assistance programs to those that can be classified as \\"social assurance\\". Danziger and Stern write that \\"Most of the increased Federal social spending over the past 25 year [in 1990] is accounted for by the expansion and indexation of social security benefits and the introduction and expansion of Medicare, Medicaid, and the Supplemental Security Income program, all of which provide benefits disproportionally[sic] to the elderly\\". Conversely, some factors may actually be working to stem the tide specifically of feminized poverty. Increased female labor force participation with more commiserate wages, combined with higher levels of female educational attainment both help to bolster the economic position of American children, especially in female-headed households. Due to these factors there may actually be a slight reversal in the trend towards feminization, but probably only for employed, more highly educated women.  Child poverty in comparative perspective  Reports show that child poverty persists at high rates in even very rich countries. It is in these contexts that the juvenilization of poverty arguments are most applicable, as child poverty exists not just alongside or concurrently with other types of poverty but within rich societies and despite or even because of poverty reduction among other groups of citizens. A 2000 report by the United Nations shows that absolute child poverty was variable internationally but still quite high in many developed countries. Percentage of Children Internationally Living in Relative Poverty Other nations take a very different approach to preventing or eliminating child poverty. In France and other European countries spending on child welfare and family support programs represents a much higher percentage of the GDP (as compared to the United States) and far outweighs spending on other major programs like military defense. In addition, many European countries offer far more comprehensive transfer packages for insuring that after-tax incomes of working families does not fall below a relative poverty line. Thus while child poverty exists globally and around the world children suffer disproportionally from material deprivation, the juvenilization of poverty argument is most politically salient in rich countries. It is in these nations with thriving economies that, say child welfare advocates, wealth has been systematically siphoned away from children and families.

He was educated in the public and parochial schools, and in night schools. From 1891 to 1893 he was an apprentice pharmacist, and in the following nineteen years learned and practiced his father's trade of stonemasonry and sculpturing, building some of the best known monuments in Milwaukee, including the Kosciuszko Monument in South Side Park. In 1912 he became a superintendent of street sanitation for the Fourteenth Ward, a position he held for sixteen years, until in 1928 he was chosen alderman for that ward. He also served as secretary of St. John Cantius Church.  Wisconsin legislative service  Galasinski was one of many Democrats elected to the Assembly in the November, 1932 general election which saw Franklin Roosevelt elected to the Presidency. Galasinski was elected to represent the 12th Milwaukee County Assembly district (the 12th and 14th Wards of the City of Milwaukee), unseating incumbent Republican Ben Wiczynski (who actually came in third behind Socialist John Sobczak) and an independent candidate, after first winning a six-way Democratic primary. He was assigned to the Assembly's standing committees on commerce and manufactures, on excise and fees, and on municipalities, serving as chairman of the latter committee.Witte, Edwin E.; Kelly, Alice, eds.
