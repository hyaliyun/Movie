After NBC-TV's cancellation of The Gillette Cavalcade of Sports in the spring of 1960, ABC took over the prime time boxing program, although it was renamed Fight of the Week. Legendary boxing commentator Don Dunphy did the blow-by-blow description of the bouts, which took place on Saturday beginning in October 1960 through September 1963. From there, the series moved to Friday nights, where it continued until ABC finally canceled prime time boxing after the bout of September 11, 1964, permanently ending 18 years of regularly scheduled prime time boxing on U.S. broadcast network television. One reason for the downturn of televised boxing occurred on Fight of the Week's the March 24, 1962 broadcast, when Emile Griffith defeated Benny \\"The Kid\\" Paret for the Welterweight Championship at New York's Madison Square Garden. Paret was carried from the ring unconscious, and died several days later as a result of his injuries that he had sustained in that bout. Fight of the Week was consistently paired with a bowling program, Make That Spare, throughout its entire run. In the event that the fight ran shorter than expected, Make That Spare would run longer to square out the hour, and vice versa. Occasionally, between September 1964 and the mid-1980s, there were a number of boxing events on broadcast television (network and syndication). Since then, however, boxing found a home with several pay-per-view specials, along with monthly, or semi-monthly scheduled bouts on premium channels such as HBO and Showtime, along with the long-running series USA Tuesday Night Fights on USA Network (1982‚Äì1998). Currently, the weekly cable bouts can be seen on ESPN2. Fight of the Week was also shown in the United Kingdom as part of the long-running BBC Saturday afternoon sports programme Grandstand. The Gillette sponsorship was listed in the Radio Times, which was considered daring at the time because the BBC was generally resistant to hints of commercialism (and sponsored programmes were not allowed even on commercial TV in the UK until the early 1990s).

It is said to have started during King Tamagusuku's reign (traditional dates: 1314‚Äì1336) and, according to Sai On's edition of the Ch≈´zan Seifu, ended in 1429 when Sh≈ç Hashi unified the island. Historical records of the period are fragmentary and mutually conflicting. Some even question the co-existence of the three polities.  Contemporary sources  Okinawa does not have their own contemporary records of the Sanzan period. Contemporary sources are limited to Chinese and, to a far lesser extent, Korean diplomatic records. They are in a fragmentary fashion and probably overshadowed by diplomatic fictions. Since the Chinese sources simply record local rulers who contacted China, they do not rule out the possibility that some other local rulers co-existed without establishing diplomatic contacts. For this reason, Okinawa's real situation remains largely a mystery. According to the Veritable Records of the Ming, the newly formed Ming dynasty sent an envoy to what it called the \\"State of Ry≈´ky≈´,\\" among many other countries, in 1372 to start tributary relations. In response, a ruler who was referred to as Satto, King of Ch≈´zan, sent his younger brother Taiki to pay tribute. In 1380, the King of Nanzan Ofusato sent a mission to Ming China, which was followed by the King of Hokuzan Haniji in 1383. The names of Hokuzan and Nanzan are apparently Ch≈´zan-centric. It is not clear who coined these names. Ming China's perception of the co-existence of the Sanzan can be found in an article of 1383 of the Veritable Records, which was based on the report of a Ming envoy who visited Okinawa in 1382. The Ming considered that there were three rulers in the region who engaged in conflict. It recognized them as \\"kings\\" and called for peace. As for the King of Hokuzan, the Veritable Records record the un-Okinawan-looking names of three kings, Haniji, Min and Han'anchi, but make no mention of their blood relations. The last diplomatic contact of Hokuzan was of 1416. The records of Nanzan are more complicated. The diplomatic missions under the name of the King of Nanzan Ofusato lasted from 1380 to 1396. An unusual characteristic of Nanzan was that the \\"King's father's younger brother\\" (ÁéãÂèî) ≈åeiji also sent envoys from 1388 to 1397. In 1403, Ououso, who claimed to be Ofusato's younger brother or cousin, reported Ofusato's death in 1403 and was recognized as King of Nanzan the next year. In 1415, Crown Prince Taromai reported that King Ououso had been murdered by his \\"elder brother\\" Tafuchi. Taromai's blood relationship with Ououso was not mentioned. As the King of Nanzan, Taromai sent envoys from 1416 to 1429. The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea records mysterious events about Nanzan. In 1394, the King of Ch≈´zan Satto requested Korea to return the \\"Nanzan Prince\\" (Â±±ÂçóÁéãÂ≠ê) Ofusato, who had supposedly fled to Korea. In 1398, the King of Nanzan Oueishi fled to Korea after reportedly being banished by the King of Ch≈´zan. He died there in the same year. These records clearly contradict with the Veritable Records, raising questions about the reliability of Okinawa's diplomatic reports to foreign countries. Ch≈´zan sent envoys to China much more frequently than Hokuzan and Nanzan. The King of Ch≈´zan paid tribute biennially from 1372 to 1382 and after that once or twice a year. Ch≈´zan's missions were also unusual in that some of them were sent under the name of the crown prince although it should have been done by the king. In 1404, Crown Prince Bunei reported King Satto's death and was recognized as the next king. In 1407, Crown Prince Sh≈ç Shish≈ç's envoy reported his \\"father\\" Bunei's death to seek the approval of the succession to the throne. An article of 1425 in the Veritable Records states that Ming China let Crown Prince Sh≈ç Hashi succeed the late King Shish≈ç. Historians have noted suspicious patterns in the Sanzans' diplomatic missions. While Ming China bestowed vessels and their crews on Ch≈´zan and Nanzan, Hokuzan has no such record. This may explain why Hokuzan's missions almost always coincided with Ch≈´zan's even though they were supposedly in conflict. In addition, staffs in the missions were apparently shared. For example, Sangurumi, who was sent to China by the Nanzan King in 1392, claimed to be a nephew (Âß™) of the King of Nanzan Ofusato. In Ch≈´zan's missions, however, he appeared as a nephew (ÂæìÂ≠ê) of the King of Ch≈´zan Satto in 1403 and as a nephew (Âß™) of the Ch≈´zan King Bunei in 1404. Even though historian Wada Hisanori regarded him as multiple persons with the same name, Wada acknowledged that the King of Nanzan Taromai's envoys and vessels clearly overlapped with those of the King of Ch≈´zan. The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty states that in 1418, Katsuren, the second son of the Ch≈´zan King, called for trade with Korea and sent vessels that carried Chinese and Southeast Asian goods. Historians have no consensus on his true identity. It is noted by historians that the Veritable Records make no mention of the supposed unification. The only thing that can be inferred from the records is that Hokuzan and Nanzan ceased to send diplomatic missions. The King of Ch≈´zan retained the title of \\"King of Ch≈´zan\\" even after he became the sole ruler of the State of Ry≈´ky≈´. In 1416, the Ashikaga sh≈çgun sent a letter in reply to the yo-no-nushi of the State of Ry≈´ky≈´ („Çä„ÅÜ„Åç„ÅÜÂúã„ÅÆ„Çà„ÅÆ„Å¨„Åó). This rare record has been handed down only on the mainland Japanese side.  Okinawa's later narratives  Okinawa's own narratives on the Sanzan period were recorded centuries later by Ry≈´ky≈´. Major history books include the Ch≈´zan Seikan (1650), Sai Taku's edition of the Ch≈´zan Seifu (1701), Sai On's revised edition of the Ch≈´zan Seifu (from 1724 onwards) and the Ky≈´y≈ç (1745). They reflect Okinawa's historical tradition to some degree. They are, however, desperate attempts to reconcile conflicting sources. Sai On, in particular, extensively rewrote his father's edition of the Ch≈´zan Seifu using newly obtained Chinese sources. As a result, he damaged its historical value, from modern historians' perspective. Additionally, the Omoro S≈çshi (1623) is helpful in understanding Okinawa's own world-view although it is a compilation of poems and by no means a history book. The Ch≈´zan Seikan and Sai Taku's edition of the Ch≈´zan Seifu follow Chinese sources in that they refer to the supposed polities as , Ch≈´zan and . For some unknown reason, however, Sai On changed the names of Sanhoku and Sannan to and respectively. A world view presented in the Omoro S≈çshi is strikingly different from that of the history books. The perception that Okinawa was divided into three polities is absent from the poem anthology. It never uses the terms of Sanzan, Sanhoku, Ch≈´zan or Sannan. The King of Hokuzan is referred to as Nakijin Aji. The supposed King of Nanzan is ≈åzato Aji. Alternatively, he is referred to as . They are no different from other regional rulers. According to Ry≈´ky≈´'s official history books, King Tamagusuku, who had maintained a unified polity, lost the support of local rulers. People in the south followed the ≈åzato Aji while the northern region was controlled by the Nakijin Aji. In other words, these books identify the Nakijin Aji as the King of Hokuzan and the ≈åzato Aji as the King of Nanzan. Most modern historians question this alleged split because they do not support the existence of a unified polity on Okinawa before the \\"reunification\\" in the 15th century. No personal names were recorded for the Nakijin Aji in the Ch≈´zan Seikan or Sai Taku's edition of Ch≈´zan Seifu. It was not known to Ry≈´ky≈´ how many rulers assumed the title. Sai On's edition of Ch≈´zan Seifu adds three personal names, Haniji, Min and Han'anchi, which were taken from a Chinese source, not from Okinawa's own. Similarly, the Ch≈´zan Seikan and Sai Taku's edition of Ch≈´zan Seifu have no record of personal names of the ≈åzato Aji. The names of Sh≈çsatto, Ououso and Tarumi, added by Sai On to the Ch≈´zan Seifu, are not based on Okinawa's tradition. Another problem is about the identification of the place of ≈åzato. There are two candidates for it: Shimasoe-≈åzato in modern-day Nanj≈ç City and Shimajiri-≈åzato in modern-day Itoman City. In addition, the Omoro S≈çshi divides southern Okinawa into three regions: the eastern region (covering Shimasoe-≈åzato), the central region and the western region (including Shimajiri-≈åzato). The Ch≈´zan Seifu identify the Shimasoe-≈åzato Aji as the King of Nanzan, which appears to reflect Okinawa's own narratives. However, both editions of the Ch≈´zan Seifu identify Shimajiri- ≈åzato as the capital of Nanzan. According to the Ch≈´zan Seikan, the Nakijin Aji's domain included Haneji, Nago, Kunigami, Kin, Ie and Iheya. The ≈åzato Aji controlled the 11 regions of Sashiki, Chinen, Tamagusuku, Gushikami, Kochinda, Shimajiri-≈åzato, Kyan, Mabuni, Makabe, Kanegusuku and Tomigusuku. The Ch≈´zan King subjugated Naha, Tomari, Urasoe, Chatan, Nakagusuku, Goeku, Yomitanzan, Gushikawa, Katsuren and Shuri. Shuri is treated as the everlasting capital of Ch≈´zan. However, it is clear from literary evidence and archaeological findings that Urasoe was the center of the most powerful polity on the island before the capital was moved to Shuri. The King of Ch≈´zan Tamagusuku was succeeded by King Seii. After Seii's death, people deposed the crown prince and enthroned Satto, the ruler of Urasoe, in 1350. Although his existence was supported by contemporary sources, his life is colored by mythology: he was a son of a humble farmer and a swan maiden. During his reign, he started to pay tribute to Ming China. Also, he received tribute from the southern island groups of Miyako and Yaeyama for the first time in history. Satto was succeeded by his son Bunei in 1395. Although the history books agree that Sh≈ç Hashi unified Okinawa, the accounts of the unification process contain non- negligible inconsistencies. The oldest Ch≈´zan Seikan states that after Sh≈ç Hashi succeeded his father Sh≈ç Shish≈ç as Sashiki Aji in 1402, he overthrew the King of Nanzan and claimed the title. He then overthrew the Ch≈´zan King Bunei in 1421 to become the King of Ch≈´zan. He finally killed the King of Hokuzan in 1422. Sai Taku's edition of Ch≈´zan Seifu generally follows the Ch≈´zan Seikan. However, it dates Sh≈ç Hashi's conquest of Ch≈´zan 16 years earlier than the Ch≈´zan Seikan. It also claims that Sh≈ç Hashi installed his father Sh≈ç Shish≈ç as King of Ch≈´zan instead of himself. Sh≈ç Hashi became the King of Ch≈´zan only after Sh≈ç Shish≈ç's death in 1421. Sai On's edition of Ch≈´zan Seifu is drastically different from these two books. It claims that Sh≈ç Hashi defeated the Ch≈´zan King and installed his father Sh≈ç Shish≈ç in 1406. He conquered Hokuzan in 1416 and Nanzan in 1429. The Ch≈´zan Seikan seems to follow Okinawa's own tradition. Sai Taku \\"corrected\\" the Ch≈´zan Seikan with Chinese records which stated that Sh≈ç Shish≈ç, Crown Prince of Ch≈´zan, reported the death of \\"his father\\" Bunei. Sai On's drastic revision was also based on Chinese records. The last diplomatic contact of Nanzan was of 1429 while that of Hokuzan was of 1416. From these records, Sai On na√Øvely inferred that these two polities ceased to exist immediately after the last contacts.  Interpretations  Modern historians have also struggled to resolve contradictions. Unlike Sai On, Wada Hisanori attached weight to the Ch≈´zan Seifu. He identified Taromai as the eldest son of Sh≈ç Hashi and concluded that the King of Nanzan Taromai was a puppet of Ch≈´zan. According to Wada, Sh≈ç Hashi overthrew the King of Nanzan in 1403 and ascended to the throne. He overthrew the King of Ch≈´zan Bunei in 1405 and installed his father Sh≈ç Shish≈ç as King of Ch≈´zan. He gave the title of King of Nanzan to his son Taromai in 1415 to become the Crown Prince of Ch≈´zan. He succeeded his father Sh≈ç Shish≈ç as King of Ch≈´zan in 1422. After the death of Taromai around 1429, Sh≈ç Hashi formally abolished Nanzan. The reason that Sh≈ç Hashi nominally maintained Nanzan was that he wished to keep profitable Chinese trade conducted under the name of the King of Nanzan. Ikuta Shigeru presented an even more radical interpretation of the Sanzan period. He dismissed Okinawa's later narratives as mere legends. He argued that the King of Nanzan was under the control of the King of Ch≈´zan from the very beginning. Due to lack of sufficient evidence, he refrained from determining Hokuzan's relationship with Ch≈´zan. He related these alleged polities to Ming China's haijin (sea ban) policy. Unlike the preceding Mongol Yuan Dynasty, the Ming Dynasty prohibited Chinese merchants from engaging in oversea trade. In order to maintain international trade that covers the vast area from Southeast Asia to Japan and Korea, they set up tribute-paying missions under the names of foreign kings. At their height, they used three dummy names. As Okinawa's importance in international trade decreased, the names of Hokuzan and Nanzan ceased to be used.  Tripartite hypothesis  Ethnologist ≈åbayashi Tary≈ç argued that the narrative of the Sanzan period recorded centuries later by Ry≈´ky≈´ reflected the tripartite ideology, which the French scholar Georges Dum√©zil found in Proto- Indo-European mythology. He mapped Hokuzan to military, Ch≈´zan to sovereignty and Nanzan to productivity. ≈åbayashi provided two types of evidence for the tripartite hypothesis. One is justifications for the unification by Sh≈ç Hashi. Sh≈ç Hashi took over King Bunei's Ch≈´zan because the king had not exercised juridical powers properly. He then destroyed the King of Hokuzan Han'anchi, who had been known for extraordinary military prowess. The official history book Ky≈´y≈ç records two theories regarding the downfall of King Taromai's Nanzan. One is that he lost public support because of his extravagant lifestyle. Another story is that he lost support from the peasantry after he exchanged his domain's lifeblood spring for Sh≈ç Hashi's gold-painted folding screen. In other words, he lost his country because he relinquished the source of productivity. Another type of evidence is regalia. Hokuzan's sacred treasure was a Japanese sword named Chiyoganemaru. When Hokuzan was about to fall, King Han'anchi got angry at the sacred sword's failure to protect the domain and threw it into the water. Nanzan's regalia was a gold-painted folding screen. It is not uncertain what kind of treasures Ch≈´zan had before Sh≈ç Hashi's takeover. ≈åbayashi claimed that a song in Omoro S≈çshi could be interpreted as Sh≈ç Hashi's possession of a sacred drum when he was a local ruler of Sashiki. The Omoro S≈çshi suggests that sacred drums were believed to give the mythical power to bring people under control.

In addition to focusing on the humane treatment of non-human animals, humane education also increasingly contains content related to the environment, the compassionate treatment of other people, and the interconnectedness of issues pertaining to people and the planet.Burnett, C.

Humane education encourages cognitive, affective, and behavioral growth through personal development of critical thinking, problem solving, perspective-taking, and empathy as it relates to people, animals, the planet, and the intersections among them. Education taught through the lens of humane pedagogy supports more than knowledge acquisition, it allows learners to process personal values and choose prosocial behaviors aligned with those values. History Humane education as a discrete field of education was created in the late 1800s by individuals like George Angell as an attempt to address social injustices and prevent cruelty to animals before it startedPreston, H. C. (1928). Milestones in humane education. Journal of Education, 107, 181. along with the formation of SPCAs, such as the Massachusetts SCPA and the ASPCA. The formation of humane education and animal protection/welfare organizations was associated with the expansion of women‚Äôs suffrage and the temperance movement, and many of those involved in creation and early advocacy of humane education also worked in those other areas of social change as well. These early activists successfully advocated for the passage of laws supporting or even requiring the teaching of humane education in schools, and many teachers did teach it.Morrill, W. M. (Nov. 11, 1920). Humane education and the teacher. Journal of Education, 100(2), 462. The animal welfare organizations also visited schools and other youth centers to teach ‚Äúpush-in‚Äù programs that supplemented‚Äîand possibly augmented‚Äîthe children‚Äôs other education. In addition to school-based programs and activities, humane education was also initially conducted through Bands of Mercy; although these have been disbanded, humane education continues to be conducted in community-based settings. These include animal shelters, humane education centers and parks as well as, e.g., Boys and Girls Clubs, YWCAs and YMCAs, cultural and religious centers, etc. Currently, humane education is often conducted by animal welfare organizations‚Äîand organizations that include humane education among their primary focuses‚Äîsuch as the Latham Foundation, the Association of Professional Humane Educators (APHE), International Network for Humane Education (InterNICHE), and ACTAsia. General Goals, Content, and Pedagogical Strategies Humane education seeks to nurture the development of compassion and concern that people‚Äîespecially children and adolescents‚Äîhave towards one group (e.g., humans) be extended to other groups (e.g., animals). One of the beliefs that helped establish humane education as a field has been that helping children learn to treat animals with kindness will encourage them to grow up to be adults who are kind to all animals, human and non- human.Thompson, K. L. & Gullone, E. (2003). Promotion of empathy and prosocial behaviour in children through humane education. Australian Psychologist, 38, 175 ‚Äì 182. This ‚Äúcross-fertilization‚Äù of kindness is also used, e.g., to try to have the care that children have for their own pets be extended to animals in their community, animals in circuses and zoos, animals in agriculture and on factory farms, or to show how reducing pollution in one‚Äôs neighborhood can help ecosystems far away.Samuels, W.

Nystrom (Eds.), Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group. =Typical Current Content= In addition to the humane treatment of domestic animals, humane education now often examines broader issues including human relationships and animal exploitation. Common topics currently covered include responsible pet care (e.g., spaying/neutering and responsible adoption); animal agriculture; factory farming; captive wild animals; understanding animal emotions, sentience, and communication; blood sports; bite prevention; ecological stewardship; the interconnectedness of life; pollution; reduction/reuse/recycling of materials; bullying; non-violent conflict resolution; critical thinking, child labor; and the effects of every-day activities on other people, animals, and the environment. =Pedagogical Strategies= Since the beginning, humane education has focused on a constructivist approach to teaching and includes methods such as service- learning and experiential learning. Organizations that conduct humane education programs, therefore, often create community- or home-based activities in which students can learn humane education content and behaviors through experience and reflection. Humane education programs may be conducted in a variety of ways in schools. Programs may be supplemental or add-on programs such as when a humane educator or the teacher of record will devote a class period to humane education content; in these cases, the lesson is often devoted wholly to teach humane education content (e.g., responsible pet or environmental care, spaying/neutering, respect for others). Programs may also be infused into the curriculum or add-ins. These infused programs allow for the most effective form of Humane Pedagogy (a teaching approach inspired by critical pedagogy, which attempts to help students activate cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains of learning and determine personal values with an ecocentric lens.) Itle-Clark, S. (2013).Inservice teachers' understanding and teaching of humane education before and after a standards- based intervention. Dissertation. Fielding Graduate University. The strongest humane pedagogy is part of both the written and unwritten curriculum. Humane education may also be integrated into traditional lessons. Since most children and adolescents find animals and nature to be engaging topics, humane education can be an effective vehicle to also teach other content, such as literature, history, civics, or science. Effectiveness Although teachers who use humane education often report anecdotal evidence that it works, and although there is a welter of qualitative research that also suggests it is effective, there are few objective, well-controlled studies that compare humane education programs against good control groups. Nonetheless, those who have studied it carefully tend to find that it is effective---probably at least as effective as other, comparable non-humane education programs. =Animal-Assisted Education= Animal-assisted education is education that is employs direct interaction/perception of animals to enhance learning. One such program used shelter dogs in a school-based violence prevention and character education program. According to the researcher, \\"[f]indings indicate that receiving the program significantly alters students‚Äô normative beliefs about aggression, levels of empathy, and displays of violent and aggressive behaviors\\"Sprinkle, J. E. (2008). Animals, empathy, and violence: Can animals be used to convey principles of prosocial behavior to children? Youth Violence and Juvenile Justice, 6, 47-58. =Push-in Programs= Probably the largest study of humane education ever conductedSamuels, W. E. (2018). Nurturing kindness naturally: A humane education program‚Äôs effect on the prosocial behavior of first and second graders across China. International Journal of Educational Research, 91, 49 ‚Äì 64. doi: 10.1016/j.ijer.2018.08.001. included a \\"large evaluation conducted over 3 separate years in 25 public elementary schools in 5 cities across eastern China\\". The author randomly assigned about half of the schools to participate in Caring-for-Life, a humane education program, and randomly assigned the other half to the control group. In all, the effect of the program was tested on over 2,000 first and second grade students. The author reports that \\"[s]tudents who participated in the program displayed significantly greater gains in prosociality than similar students who didn‚Äôt. Students who participated in an expanded version of the program appeared to realize even greater gains\\". Another experimental-vs-control studyW.E. Samuels, L. Meers, S. Normando (2016). Improving upper elementary students‚Äô humane attitudes and prosocial behaviors through an in-class humane education program, Anthrozo√∂s, 29(4) pp. 597-610, doi: 10.1080/08927936.2016.1228751 compared the effect of the Roots and Shoots humane education program on elementary students in several schools in two cities in the United States. The authors found that \\"[s]tudents who participated in the humane education program showed stronger growth in both of these outcomes compared with students in the control group\\". However, they did not find differences in disruptive behaviors between students who participated in the humane education program and the control program (a chess club). Overall, the authors state that \\"[e]ffects appeared strongest on attitudes; behavioral effects were found to be largely limited to behaviors directly addressed by the humane education program\\". =Duration of Effects= The effects of a humane education program seem to last for at least a year. Piek and colleaguesJ.P. Piek, R. Kane, D. Rigoli, S. Mclaren, C.M. Roberts, R. Rooney, L. Straker (2015). Does the Animal Fun program improve social- emotional and behavioural outcomes in children aged 4‚Äì6 years? Human Movement Science, 43, 155-163 found that young children randomly assigned to participate in the Animal Fun program, which \\"was designed to enhance motor and social development in young children\\" showed significant improvements in teacher-rated prosocial behaviour and total difficulties compared to children randomly assigned to the control group. The effect of the program was found to still be strong not only 6 months but also 12 and 18 months later. As the authors states, \\"The Animal Fun program appears to be effective in improving social and behavioural outcomes\\".

The route is designated from Interstate 80 (I-80) and PA 42 in Buckhorn to the New York state line near New York State Route 417 (NY 417) in Ceres Township. Commissioned in 1927 by the Pennsylvania Department of Highways, PA 44 originally ran from the New York state line to Jersey Shore. Today, the highway is a scenic route from Columbia County to Potter County. Route description =Columbia and Montour counties= PA 44 northbound one kilometer from its southern terminus. PA 44 begins in the census-designated place of Buckhorn in Hemlock Township, Columbia County at an intersection with PA 42 and exit 232 of I-80. From here, the route heads northwest along two- lane undivided Buckhorn Road, passing businesses before running past homes in Buckhorn. The road continues through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes through the Appalachians. PA 44 winds north and curves northwest to enter Madison Township, passing through more rural areas. The route runs through agricultural land with some woods and residences, turning west before heading back to the northwest, winding across a wooded ridge.

From here, the road continues north for less than to a T-intersection with NY 417. History Mahanoy City. When PA 44 was commissioned in 1927, the route was designated from U.S. Route 220 in Jersey Shore to the New York- Pennsylvania border. Northeast of Coudersport from PA 49 to PA 244, and from US 6 to US 220, the road was not paved. From Jersey Shore to Turbotville, PA 44 was assigned the Pennsylvania Route 54 designation. From Turbotville to Jerseytown, the road was designated as Pennsylvania Route 454. From Jerseytown to Buckhorn, 44 was numbered as Pennsylvania Route 342. These designations were eliminated with an extension of PA 44 in 1941. By 1940, PA 44 was extended east to Turbotville, replacing the previous PA 54 alignment. Also in the 1940s, PA 44 was completely paved from Coudersport to the New York state line. In the 1950s, PA 44 was largely extended to Mahanoy City in Schuylkill County. By 1970, the road was truncated to its current southern terminus in Buckhorn. On June 28, 2018, Governor Tom Wolf approved legislation that named the section of PA 44 in Potter County between the Lycoming County line and US 6 as Highway to the Stars, as it passes through Cherry Springs State Park. The idea for the name came from photographer Curt Weinhold, a Potter County resident. State Representative Martin Causer sponsored the legislation for naming the section of PA 44 as Highway to the Stars.

Retrieved June 26, 2013. Broadcast history The series was hosted by the former actor and nightclub singer Johnny Johnston except in the 1961-1962 season, when Win Elliot hosted. Contestants were all members of the Professional Bowlers Association and wore their PBA bowling shirt uniforms. The program was consistently paired with Fight of the Week, the weekly network broadcasts of 10-round boxing matches on ABC, hosted by Don Dunphy. The fights were broadcast by WABC, Channel 7 in New York City, beginning at 10:00pm Eastern time. On most nights, the fights lasted until 10:45pm. To fill the available 15 minutes before 11pm, ABC broadcast Make That Spare. If the fights ran late, Make That Spare was pre-empted. (Jackpot Bowling, a bowling show on NBC, followed the same scheduling format during its 1959-60 airings; that show was likewise tied to Fight of the Week's predecessor, Gillette Cavalcade of Sports Friday Night Fight.) The program was broadcast live from the Paramus Bowling Center in Paramus, New Jersey; the show's varying time slot was adjusted through how much time the contestants were given to banter or to prepare for each shot (the game had to be moved along more quickly if a boxing match ran late). Miller High Life and Kool cigarettes were the show's sponsors. The professional bowler Don Carter made history on October 28, 1961, when he was the first to convert the 6-7-8-10 sweepstakes spare. For his efforts, he was rewarded with the grand prize of $19,000. Carter made the same split four episodes later, winning another $8,000. Monroe Moore also made the 6-7-8-10 spare and held the program's record by winning nine weeks in a row. Make That Spare was ABC's first foray into televised bowling. The network began showing full PBA bowling matches in 1962 and eventually the Professional Bowlers Tour, which showed regular contests on the network until Disney took over ABC in 1997. Because Make That Spare was inextricably tied to Fight of the Week, that show's cancellation also led to Make That Spare ending. =Game play= Each bowler was given a series of pin configurations and one roll of the bowling ball to knock down all the pins and convert the (hypothetical) spare. As the bowlers progressed, the spares became more challenging and the point values increased. Each frame was configured as follows: # The \\"dinner bucket\\": pins 2-4-5-8, worth 25 points. # The \\"clothesline\\": pins 1-2-4-7, worth 25 points. # The \\"steam fitter\\": a 4-5 split, worth 50 points. # The \\"washout\\": pins 1-2-4-10, worth 50 points. # The 5-7 split: worth 100 points. The highest scorer won $1,000 and the right to convert a \\"sweepstakes spare\\" worth a minimum of $5,000; making all five spares in the main game earned an additional $1,000 bonus. The loser also received a check for a lesser, unspecified \\"loser's share\\". In early seasons, the sweepstakes spare was always the 6-7-8-10; this was later changed to a randomly chosen spare. If this spare was not converted on a given program, $1,000 was added for the following week until won. In 1964, making the sweepstakes spare won a Ford Mustang.Video of a 1964 \\"Make That Spare\\" episode, showing random selection of the sweepstakes spare and prize of new Ford Mustang, YouTube. Retrieved June 26, 2013. The winner of each weekly episode also earned the right to return the following week to defend his championship against a new challenger. There was some controversy over the selection of spares, as the arrangements were not reversed for left-handed bowlers. (The chosen configurations of the \\"clothesline\\" and \\"washout\\", as well as the sweepstakes spare, are all easier for right-handed bowlers to convert.) This is mentioned on one of the extant episodes of the series. Revival attempts =1988 pilot= The program was shown as a one-time special on March 12, 1988, with Chris Schenkel and Nelson Burton Jr. as the commentators, before that day's live PBA match on ABC's long-running Saturday afternoon series Pro Bowlers Tour. This special was the pilot for ABC when they considered remaking Make That Spare as a series during the 1989 PBA season\\"'Make That Spare' set to strike again\\", Reading Eagle, December 17, 1987. but the series never materialized. =Late 2000s revival= TVS Television Network produced a revival of the series, set at the Silver Nugget Casino in Las Vegas. The network ceased public operations in 2012. The number of episodes, the extent of its distribution and other details of the series are unknown. Episode status The series was never copyrighted and extant episodes from the 1960s run (at least three) are thus in the public domain.

June 2008 saw a \\"Director's Edition\\" reprint of the first two series of Amazing Joy Buzzards in a digest size trade paperback. The \\"Director's Edition\\" was translated in September 2009 into Italian by Renior Comics.

In total there are three digest sized volumes planned with the final in the series titled \\"Strohm's Pit\\".  Plot  The Amazing Joy Buzzards are a rock 'n' roll adventure band that battles evil in all forms. The groups consists of Biff Ashby, Gabe Carlyle, and Stevo Vargas. Unbeknownst to the band, The Amazing Joy Buzzards are managed by Dalton Warner of the Creative International Artists Agency, which is really the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Warner uses the band's superstar status as a cover to get into places to which he normally would not have access. Dalton uses the band's knack for defeating supernatural evils to his advantage. The Amazing Joy Buzzards have the assistance of a Mexican Wrestling genie named El Campeon who assists people in their time of need. He can be summoned by a magic amulet and by shouting the words \\"Go El Campeon Go!\\".  Characters  = Heroes = Biff Ashby (First Appearance: AJB Vol. 1 #1) is the lead singer of the Amazing Joy Buzzards. He has mysterious green eyes that no woman can resist and an ego larger than the Colossus of Rhodes. Biff is always game for the ladies, but doesn't mind taking lumps for the lads. His stage presence only hints at his future importance to the world. Don't tell him that though, his head doesn't need to grow any larger. Stevo Vargas (First Appearance: AJB Vol. 1 #1) is the Amazing Joy Buzzards' bass player who's the wildest one of the bunch. Stevo is a martial arts expert and a champion racecar driver. The world moves around him at its own pace but Stevo moves to the beat of his own drum. It may be hard to understand what Stevo is saying, but just make sure you're standing on his side in a skirmish. Some people suspect that he is half yeti. Gabe Carlyle (First Appearance: AJB Vol. 1 #1) is the geek-sheik drummer of the band with the super sexy brains of the bunch. He may not have the smashing looks of Biff, or the agility of Stevo, but when it comes to solving a mystery he would be the one to encourage. Gabe's father was an archeologist that went missing while exploring a strange land many years ago and Gabe is still hopeful of finding him to this day. Gabe Carlyle carries an amulet which can summon the mythical Mexican wrestler El Campeon. El Campeon (First Appearance: AJB Vol. 1 #1) is the loyal mystical Mexican wrestler guardian of the band who happens to be a genie. El Campeon is a Mexican Wrestling Genie who happens to be the guardian of rock and roll band The Amazing Joy Buzzards. The Amazing Joy Buzzards can summon El Campeon by using a magic amulet and yelling the magic words: \\"GO EL CAMPEON GO!\\". His first appearance is in the Amazing Joy Buzzards Vol. 1 #1 which appeared in January 2005. The Amazing Joy Buzzards first came across El Campeon during their adventures in Costa Rica in the story titled \\"The Devil's Zapatos\\" where he teams up with the drummer of the band Gabe Carlyle. El Campeon's origin story was told in the single issue book \\"The Night of a Thousand Luchadores\\" which was printed in the Amazing Joy Buzzards Vol. 2 #5 and drawn by comic book artist Doug Holgate. Over time there have been a few incarnations of El Campeon and the current one is estimated to be the fourth. Little is known about El Campeon's larger purpose. He is known to help people in their time of need. He is sometimes known to take the form of a Fox. Over the years his costume has also seen more than a few changes. He is afraid of midgets. El Campeon is brutal in battle, but easily distracted by edibles. El Campeon loves cereal, churros and donuts, and has been known to sleep for entire weeks at a time. El Campeon is summoned by the Amazing Joy Buzzards with the use of a magical amulet but as is evidenced in \\"The Amazing Joy Buzzards and the Christmas Troll\\" when Santa Clause uses a similar amulet we discover that there is actually more than one magical amulet that are capable of summoning him with the magic words. El Campeon's sworn enemy in the Amazing Joy Buzzards series is named El Chupa who is a new addition to the Spider Syndicate and the leader of the Chupacabras controlling the monsters in the South and Central American Territories. Professor Yu (First Appearance: AJB Vol. 1 #1) is the \\"M\\" of the Amazing Joy Buzzards. He is a world-renowned scientist who believes in the Amazing Joy Buzzards and has gotten them into and out of many situations with his inventions. Gabe is good friends with the Professor but has had more interest in the Professor's daughter Betty than in science as of late. Betty Yu (First Appearance: AJB Vol. 1 #2) is the daughter of Professor Yu with super sexy brains, a winning personality, and is always up for an adventure. Since the Island of Maru excursion Gabe and Betty have become quite the pair. Dalton Warner (First Appearance: AJB Vol. 1 #3) is the manager and the handler of the Amazing Joy Buzzards. He works for Creative International Artists which uses the band's bigger-than-Elvis status to make the world a safer place. Dalton's signature items are a 1965 Shelby Cobra, a silencer, and a pencil-thin mustache. His favorite drink is a Maker's Mark. Dalton discovered the band playing in Costa Rica at their Uncle Vargas' hotel. Murphy (First Appearance: AJB Vol. 1 #3) is a mysterious female agent who's an old flame from Dalton's past that keeps popping up. Despite Dalton's special CIA training he still can't hide the fact that he has feelings for her even after all this time. She's a wildcard, a weapons and tactics expert and good in a clutch. Just don't leave any knives around her, you never know where they might end up. Her signature drink is a Greyhound, heavy on the vodka. = Villains = The Puppeteer (First Appearance: AJB Vol. 1 #2) is the diminutive leader of the Spider Syndicate, a group of Supernatural Mod Hipsters who want to take over the world to make it a better place after being influenced by the spirit of the counterculture from the 1960s when anything seemed possible. The Spiders date far, far back and have changed direction considerably under the guidance of The Puppeteer. His age is unknown, but he's pretty old. He's something of a misunderstood genius, inventor, and mad scientist who wants to take over the world to make it a better place and change the status quo. He's also got a small army of KILLER VAMPIRE ROBOTS! at his disposal. His favorite drink is Castle Knappogue but it makes him tipsy and he can't drink too much or hold too much liquor because of his small size. He's also got a giant crush on Ivep, who's got a giant crush on someone else. Donovan the Devil Mummy Hipster (First Appearance: AJB Vol. 2 #1) is from Russia and he's quite the Scenester. He's got a good heart on him and is well read. He's a sucker for Apple Martinis, nice suits, and owns all of The Amazing Joy Buzzards' albums, ever the devoted fan. The Pink Bot (First Appearance: AJB Vol. 1 #1) used to be the scourge of the robot underworld under the name Darkbot, while fighting the AJB in an earlier encounter he fell into a vat and was dyed pink losing all credibility with the other underworld robots. He swore revenge on the Amazing Joy Buzzards and turned Stevo into a giant Gila Monster in AJB #1. He's in jail now after running into El Campeon's elbow. Madam Ivep (First Appearance: AJB Vol. 1 #2) is a stunning supernatural beauty and it's no wonder that the Puppeteer has fallen so hard for her and that he's wound so tightly around her finger. She's really, really old, but has held up well over the centuries. She's madly in love with Galesh who she sprung from his tomb in the Amazing Joy Buzzards and the Island of Maru. Galesh (First Appearance: AJB Vol. 1 #2) is an Angel who gave up his wings to walk the Earth among men centuries ago. During a raid on a Caravan he got hit over the head with a rock and forgot all about his angelic nature. He was taken Prisoner by a king, and bled to prolong the King's daughters' life. After escaping he vowed to take revenge on man for the crimes against him. He joined up with Strohm, the architect of the tower of Babel, and set out to create a tower of Babel in reverse to end humanity. He got stopped and entombed but the bad news is he's out and about again, and honestly I'd be more than a little worried. During the Island of Maru incident he had a stare down with Gabe and stole his leather jacket and Gabe's vowed to get it back. Hypno (First Appearance: AJB Vol. #1) is a Hollywood agent, who's got Hypnotic Powers. He's just a minor villain but enough said, if you stare into his hypno amulet for too long you might find yourself doing his bidding. Killer Vampire Robots! (First Appearance: AJB Vol. 1 #2) are the foot soldiers of the Spiders, they may just be mechanical but their bite sure hurts, just ask El Campeon! Joe Stereo (First Appearance: AJB Vol. 1 #1) is a Brit Punker who hates the Amazing Joy Buzzards for being number one on the charts. He's tired of living in their shadow and I've got a feeling he'll soon be up to no good. He was nearly crushed to death with his grand pappy by a mutated Stevo Vargas Gila Monster. His Band is called Joe Stereo & The Sex Kittens. El Chupa (First Appearance: AJB Vol. 2 #1) is the sworn enemy of El Campeon and he controls the continent of Central America. He's the leader of the Chupacabras and is a nasty one to face, as he's almost a direct doppelganger of El Campeon but we'll find out more about that later. Their feud goes back hundreds of years. There's about four different varieties of Chupacabras. He's of the Alphacabra variety, and the ones that go after livestock are the Beta Cabras who are his minions. The other two breeds are extremely rare. Favorite drink Tequila. If there's evil afoot in Central America, most likely he's behind it. El Chicos Meurtes & El Chavo (First Appearances: AJB Vol. 2 #3) are some of the many rival luchadores who come out of the woodwork to challenge El Campeon. There's hundreds more where those two came from. Black Peter & Yanni The Christmas Troll (First Appearance: Image Comics 2005 Holiday Special) are two villains who set out to hijack Christmas, thankfully El Campeon happens to show up at the North Pole to save the day. Anton Loveless (First Appearance: The Amazing Joy Buzzards Vol.2 Original Trade Paperback Story) is the leader of the Goth Vampire band named GreatWhiteLionSnake who the Amazing Joy Buzzards go up against to defend the purity of Rock and Roll.

The Court set out a number of principles regarding the interpretation of treaties between the Crown and aboriginal peoples in Canada. Background Wayne Badger, Leroy Kiyawasew, and Ernest Ominayak were Cree and status Indians under the Treaty No. 8. They were each caught hunting for food on private land. Badger was caught near a farm house, Kiyawasew was caught in a farmer's field, while Ominayak was caught in a field of Muskeg. They were charged under the Wildlife Act. At trial the three accused argued that they were entitled to hunt as part of their aboriginal treaty rights. The Crown argued that the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement of 1930 had extinguished the rights granted by Treaty No. 8. The accused were convicted and the convictions were upheld on appeal. The issues before the Supreme Court were: # whether status Indians under Treaty No. 8 have the right to hunt for food on privately owned land which lies within the territory surrendered under that Treaty. # whether the hunting rights set out in Treaty No. 8 have been extinguished or modified by the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement. # the extent, if any, that sections 26(1) (requiring a hunting licence) and 27(1) (establishing hunting seasons) of the Wildlife Act applied to the accused. Reasons of the court Justice Cory, writing for the majority, held that the appeals of Badger and Kiyawasew should be dismissed but Ominayak's appeal should be allowed and a new trial should be directed. The Treaty, Cory found, granted the right to \\"pursue their usual vocations of hunting, trapping, and fishing\\", which was limited by geography and the right of the government to conserve Wildlife. Cory gave several principles in interpreting treaties: # a treaty represents an exchange of solemn promises between the Crown and the various Indian nations. # the honour of the Crown is always at stake; the Crown must be assumed to intend to fulfil its promises. # any ambiguities or doubtful expressions must be resolved in favour of the Indians and any limitations restricting the rights of Indians under treaties must be narrowly construed. # the onus of establishing strict proof of extinguishment of a treaty or aboriginal right lies upon the Crown. Cory then turned to the issue of the NRTA. He found that it extinguished the right to hunt commercially but not the right to hunt for food. When interpreting any treaties, they must be given their natural meaning as understood by the Indians at the time that they were signed. The limitation of the hunting treaty should be based on visible, incompatible land use. On this basis, the appeals for Badger and Kiyawasew must be dismissed as they were hunting where it was visibly incompatible with the land use. Cory considered whether the Wildlife Act, which required hunting licenses, violated their aboriginal right to hunt. He found that it did violate their rights and could not be justified under the Sparrow test.

The HVO was the main military force of Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the initial stage of the Bosnian War, the HVO fought alongside the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) against the Bosnian Serbs, but in the latter stage of the conflict clashed against its former ally, particularly in the Mostar area. HVO was incorporated into the Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (VFBiH) in December 1995 by following agreement made after signing the Dayton Accords. In December 2005 HVO was reorganized as 1st Infantry (Guard) Regiment of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, after VFBiH and Army of Republika Srpska were united into a single armed force. History The HVO (Croatian Defence Council) was established on April 8, 1992 in Grude by the political leadership of Croats, mainly members of Croatian Democratic Union (Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica) as a military formation of Herzeg-Bosnia.

While first three zones were grouped more or less together, Posavina was completely isolated in northern Bosnia on right bank of Sava river around Ora≈°je and was entirely dependent on support from Croatia. There was also an HCO headquarters in the Bihac enclave which liaised with the ABiH 5th corps. Each OZ controlled 8-14 infantry brigades, a military police battalion and an MP \\"Light Assault Battalion\\". The HVO also included the brigade sized Ante Bruno Bu≈°iƒá Regiment manned by full-time soldiers, two independent infantry battalions, a light anti-aircraft artillery battalion, Special Forces and artillery units. =Guard brigades= *1. Guard Brigade \\"Bruno Bu≈°iƒá\\" *2. Guard Brigade *3. Guard Brigade \\"Hawks\\" *4. Guard Brigade \\"Sons of Posavina\\" The Guards brigades were the sections of the HVO which handled its heavy weapons. The HVO had around 50 tanks, 400 artillery pieces, and 200 armored troop carriers. =Other brigades= There were 38 infantry brigades staffed by reservists, 19 had names and/or numbers and 19 only had names. The names commemorated famous or infamous figures from Croatian and Bosnian history. Each brigade had three or four battalions plus supporting elements. Two, the 107th and 109th were later transferred en masse to the ABiH due to their Moslem majorities, as did the Muslim contingent of the 108th Brigade who went on to form the ABiH's 108 Motorised Brigade. The 107th became the ABiH 107th \\"Chilvalrous\\" Brigade while the 109th became the 109th Mountain Brigade. 1993 restructuring In 1993 General Ante Roso restructured the HVO along the lines of the Croatian Army (HV). The four OZ's were designated as Corps Districts Mostar, Tomislavgrad, Vitez and Ora≈°je. Ora≈°je included a much reduced Bosanska Posavina. Four Guards Brigades were formed, each manned by full-time professional soldiers. 29 brigades were reformed as three-battalion strong Home Defense Regiments (domobranska pukovnija), usually with the same name and depot. Four brigades were disbanded. The military police were reduced to one Light Assault Brigade at Mostar. Eight HVO units served with the ARBiH while two HVO brigades were forcibly incorporated into the ARBiH. The 115th Brigade became part of the ARBiH 2nd Corps while the King Tvrtko Brigade became part of the ABiH 1st Corps. HVO aviation The HVO Air Forces and Anti-aircraft Artillery was formed in 1992 and consisted of the 11th Combined Squadron, operated helicopters and transports, and the 121st Observation Squadron which operated various civilian light aircraft in an observation and communications role. There was also the 14th Anti-aircraft Missile Unit which operated several different SAM systems.

There is no safe anchorage close to this atoll, which makes it often inaccessible to outsiders. Geography Sikaiana is a remote tropical coral atoll located at Latitude: 8¬∞ 25' 0 South and Longitude: 162¬∞ 52' 0 East, over 200 kilometres from any other islands. The main island at Sikaiana atoll, located at the easternmost corner, is called Sikaiana. The three small islands in the west of the atoll are Tehaolei, Matuiloto and Matuavi. There are also two artificial islands on the reef, Te Palena and Hakatai'atata. History Administratively Sikaiana is governed as an outlying region of Malaita Province in Solomon Islands. Sikaiana's population is approximately 300 people of Polynesian descent‚Äînot of the Melanesian descent prevalent in the main Solomon Islands. It is considered by anthropologists to be a Polynesian outlier. A 1998 GAO report stated: In 1893, in order both to regulate a practice of labor recruitment or ‚Äòblackbirding‚Äô of Solomon Islanders to work on labor plantations in Queensland, Australia, and to further its own colonial interests, the United Kingdom established a protectorate over most of what is now the Solomon Islands.

Rolandi started out as a violinist, at the age of 6, yet remembers that \\"when there was nobody home, I'd turn on opera records and sing along with Tosca and Madama Butterfly.\\" By the late 1960s she was studying violin at the Brevard Music Center, and she attended the North Carolina School of the Arts as a violin major in her senior year of high school. She took her first voice lessons at the Brevard Music Center, and continued a long association with the Center, where many of her coloratura roles were learned and first performed.1975 Brevard Music Festival Program Book. p. 31. The soprano then trained for four years at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. She was a finalist in the Metropolitan Opera auditions in 1974, winning the Minna Kaufmann Ruud Competition as one of the youngest winners in its history. She graduated from the Curtis Institute in 1975. Debut at New York City Opera Rolandi landed a contract with the New York City Opera in 1975, before graduating from the Curtis Institute that same year. Her operatic debut, at NYCO, was as Olympia in Les contes d'Hoffmann and as Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos, for both of which she received critical acclaim. While in New York, Rolandi studied singing with Ellen Faull. Appearing regularly with the City Opera since her debut, Rolandi moved beyond soubrette roles in operettas, and was a leading coloratura soprano at the NYCO for the next 15 years, singing more than 30 operatic roles, including I puritani, La traviata, La fille du r√©giment, Rigoletto, Lucia di Lammermoor, The Cunning Little Vixen, Lakm√©, and Giulio Cesare. In her early years at the NYCO, Rolandi was able to establish her career firmly without needing to go abroad. In 1982 she said, \\"I feel like I've grown up here.... The City Opera is a blessing for me, as it is for lots of young singers. You get exposure and you don't have to leave home.\\"Anderson, Susan Heller. \\"'Lucia,' Live from Gianna Rolandi.\\" New York Times. April 9, 1982.

At the Met she also sang Olympia in The Tales of Hoffmann in 1983, the title role of Stravinsky‚Äôs Le Rossignol in 1984 (broadcast internationally), and Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos in 1984/85 (broadcast internationally). At the Lyric Opera of Chicago she made her debut as Dorinda in Handel's Orlando (1986), and returned to sing Despina in Cos√¨ fan tutte (1993‚Äì94), a production that marked her retirement from the stage. Rolandi also performed with many of the other major North American opera companies, including the San Francisco Opera, the Canadian Opera Company, the Washington National Opera, Florida Grand Opera, Santa Fe Opera, and the Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston, SC. She debuted in Europe in 1981 at Glyndebourne as Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos, returning in 1984 for her first performances of Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro and Zdenka in Arabella, to critical acclaim. Other major European engagements included Ginevra in Ariodante and Cleopatra in Giulio Cesare in Geneva, Constanze in Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail in Lyon and Paris, Almirena in Rinaldo at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet in Paris, Amenaide in Tancredi in Turin, the breeches role of Curiatius in Gli Orazi e i Curiazi in Rome, and Elcia in Mos√® in Egitto at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro, Italy. Rolandi recorded Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro under Bernard Haitink. On television, she was the title role in two Live from Lincoln Center opera broadcasts: Lucia di Lammermoor (1982) and The Cunning Little Vixen (1983), and she was Clorinda in an English-language version of La Cenerentola (1980). And she was Zdenka in the 1984 film version of Arabella, in the Glyndebourne production. Rolandi's concert and recital engagements included appearances with the various major ensembles, including the New York Philharmonic, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Atlanta Symphony, the National Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, and the London Philharmonic, with conductors including Leonard Bernstein, Andrew Davis, Bernard Haitink, Erich Leinsdorf, and James Levine. Directorship at Lyric Opera of Chicago Following her retirement from vocal performance in 1994, Rolandi has devoted herself to pedagogy and administration. She became Director of Vocal Studies for the Lyric Opera of Chicago's Ryan Opera Center and its Lyric Opera Center for American Artists (LOCAA) in May 2002, and was then named Director of the Ryan Opera Center and the LOCAA in 2006, succeeding Richard Pearlman upon his death. The LOCAA, founded in 1973, is the professional artist-development program for Lyric Opera of Chicago. LOCAA is considered one of the most prestigious vocal programs in America,Ketterson, Mark Thomas. \\"Lyric Opera Center for American Artists Trains the Opera Singers of the Future.\\" usOperaweb.

Ryan Opera Center ‚Äì Lyric Opera of Chicago Upon Rolandi's appointment as director, William Mason, General Director of Lyric Opera, said, \\"Gianna has been part of the decision-making process since coming to Lyric. No one understands the program and how it functions better than she. Richard raised the level of the opera center a great deal, and then Gianna took it up another notch. She's a great colleague, and the [young singers] are very fond of her.\\"Von Rhein, John. \\"Lyric Opera's Rolandi to Oversee Training Center.\\" Chicago Tribune. May 9, 2006. Mason continued, \\"She brings her personal experience as a singer to the program, and has proven herself to be a superb teacher. Many of the young singers she has worked with have already launched distinguished careers.\\" As director of the LOCAA, Rolandi oversees all aspects of the center's activities and operations, including traveling to all auditions; selecting the dozen participants each year; overseeing each artist's vocal and artistic development; selecting guest teachers and resident faculty; planning concert engagements and recitals; and working closely with Lyric Opera of Chicago to cast LOCAA members for Lyric Opera's mainstage season. Rolandi also oversees the company's educational outreach programs, \\"Opera in the Neighborhoods\\" and \\"Meet the Artists.\\" Of her participation in the Lyric Opera Center for American Artists, Rolandi says, :I really enjoy LOCAA because you have the cream of the crop here. Everything they go through, I have been through. The first thing I want to pass on to them is how to do it. I was fortunate to have a solid technique and could sing standing on my head if I had to, and that's what I want for them‚Äîan easy production.... Kids this age have to be careful; they all want to sound like Brunnhildes. Having been a coloratura, I know it is possible to be heard in big houses without screaming your guts out. I want them to develop patience and a real sense of self-confidence, so they can stand up for what they believe in musically and not be pushed around. That's so important in this field; you can have four sessions with four different coaches and they will all tell you something different. You have to learn how to make something your own, and how to tell somebody that's the way you do it. I want them to be unique. Rolandi retired as director after the 2012/2013 season. Personal life Rolandi became acquainted with conductor Andrew Davis when he conducted her performances of Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos, both at the Metropolitan Opera in 1984 and again at Glyndebourne in 1988. They married in 1989, and lived in England until 2000, when Davis was appointed the music director and principal conductor of the Lyric Opera of Chicago. They now live in Chicago, where Rolandi was director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago's Ryan Opera Center and the LOCAA until 2013. Since Sir Andrew Davis's knighthood in 1999, Rolandi may be referred to as Lady Davis.

The not-for-profit financial cooperative offers membership to employees and cast members of The Walt Disney Company and their family members. As of December 2016, the credit union has thirteen branches, in excess of 180,000 members and over $1.9 billion in assets. History The credit union was formed in 1968 at the request of a group of Disneyland Park cast members, and when first chartered was called the DRC Federal Credit Union. DRC was an acronym for the Disneyland Recreational Club, which was a precursor to the Disneyland Resort's current Cast Activities department. The offices moved a number of times before relocating off Disneyland's traditional premises: The first office was a couple of rooms behind the camera shop on main street. Al Yee, a Disneyland accountant, was the first member and had account number 1 until his death. The DRC building in the 1970s was a double-wide \\"temporary\\" building, externally decorated with contemporary Studio look with planter boxes and wood exterior. It was located in the center of the employees backstage area, east of Main Street, U.S.A., west of the original park's Administration Building and south of the current location of Space Mountain (what was then called the Temporary Tomorrowland Stage). Sometime before the end of 1977, the building was moved to the area just inside of the tall chainlink fence on Harbor Blvd and a bit north of the original employee entry (what Disneyland Security called Harbor House) for the employees parking lot that was on the east side of the original property. In the 1970s, DRC Federal Credit Union changed its name to Disneyland Employees Federal Credit Union. In the 1980s, at the request of CEO Michael Eisner, the credit union was asked to stop using the name \\"Disneyland\\" so the name was changed once again to Partners Federal Credit Union. Partners merged with Vista Federal Credit Union in November 2007. Vista FCU, which was established in 1960 prior to Partners, also served Walt Disney Company Cast Members and employees primarily of The Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California and Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. Membership Eligibility Originally, membership in Partners FCU was limited to Walt Disney Company employees working in Orange County, California. When the Walt Disney Company took over management of the RMS Queen Mary in Long Beach in 1988, employees working for that attraction were added to the field of membership. In 2001, the field of membership for Partners FCU was expanded to cover any employee or Cast Member working for the Walt Disney Company in the United States.

Amy Maud Bock (1859 ‚Äì 29 August 1943) was a Tasmanian-born New Zealand female confidence trickster and male impersonator, whose trials and cross-dressing interlude have made her a subject of perennial historical interest in her adopted country. Early life (1859‚Äì1884) BockAmy Bock - Te Ara was born to Alfred Bock and Mary Ann Parkinson in Hobart, Tasmania, in 1859. Her family was itinerant, moving from Hobart to Sale, Victoria and finally settled in Melbourne in 1874. Mary Ann Parkinson was in fragile mental and physical health, and died soon afterwards in a psychiatric institution. For the next decade of her life, Amy Bock worked as a teacher in Gippsland, Victoria, until she encountered legal trouble after she was found to have received goods under false pretences in 1884. Alfred Bock persuaded her to emigrate to New Zealand, where he lived in Auckland with his second wife. Criminal career (1884‚Äì1907) After she settled in New Zealand, Bock found work as a governess, but this position was to prove short-lived. After a few weeks of employment, she began what would later become a habitual pattern that involved emotional inducements to her employers to part with their money or subterfuge designed to secure their property, followed by her flight, and then tearful and repentant return, pleading the malignant influence of her kleptomaniac mother on her perennial habit of theft. Bock first came before the New Zealand courts in April 1886, at the Resident Magistrates Court in Wellington. As in Gippsland, she was charged with receiving stolen goods in Christchurch, and sentenced to one month's imprisonment at Addington Prison in that same city. By July 1887, she was back before the court on fraud charges, and sentenced to six months' detention at Caversham Industrial School in Dunedin. The governor was impressed by her manners and social skills and offered her a position as a teacher after she was released in January 1888. However, she was found to be engineering her escape through correspondence with a supportive but fictitious aunt. She left the school and took up independent music instruction, only to fall afoul of the law once again. She was back in court in April 1888 for her habitual offence of receiving goods under false pretences. She was sentenced to another two months of imprisonment. In 1889, Bock shifted to Akaroa, on Banks Peninsula (near Christchurch on the South Island). She again found work as a governess, but reoffended and was sentenced to concurrent six-month sentences for theft and false pretences in April 1889. On release, she returned to Dunedin, where she served as a housekeeper until June 1890, when she tried to pawn her employer's chattel. After a three-year period of imprisonment, Bock resettled in Timaru at the quarters of the local branch of the Salvation Army, but was later apprehended trying to pawn her landlady's watch in April 1893. In November 1893, she moved to Oamaru where she once more obtained money by false pretences, tried to defraud a furniture seller, and was imprisoned again in January 1894. After Bock's last interim conviction, she seemed to have finally reformed, spending some time at a Catholic-run Magdalen Asylum for 'fallen' women until she resurfaced in 1902. Masquerading as Molly/Mary Shannon, she defrauded investors of sums required to start a fictitious poultry farm, and was again imprisoned for two years in March 1903. She earned remission for good behaviour, and was freed late in 1904. She found work at Rakaia as \\"Amy Chanel\\", but was later found to have tried to alter a cheque, and served a three-year sentence. In 1907, she was released and lived quietly in Christchurch for a year. In 1908, she became a housekeeper to Arthur Vallance, and tried to pawn his furniture, eluding apprehension by inventing another fictitious aunt, a Miss Charlotte Skevington. At this point, Bock began her most audacious masquerade, as a male. \\"Percy Redwood\\" (1908) As Percy Leonard Carol Redwood, an affluent Canterbury sheep farmer, Bock holidayed at Port Molyneux on the South Otago coast, where \\"Percy\\" wooed Agnes Ottaway, the daughter of the landlady. Bock maintained her male impersonation through adept use of letters purported to be from lawyers, postal orders and small loans. \\"Percy\\" and Agnes even married on 21 April 1909, but it was not to last as the \\"groom\\" was arrested at \\"his\\" mother-in-law's hotel, 3 days after the wedding. It was at the time of the arrest when Agnes discovered the secret behind \\"Percy\\". Bock was then taken back to the Dunedin Supreme Court, and was declared an habitual criminal. When the petition for an annulment of the marriage was heard in the Supreme Court, Counsel reminded the Judge that the situation was not unprecedented in Dunedin, and commented on the earlier Lance v. Trequair case, where two women had lived together for eight years before parting ways. \\"The fact of a woman [like Agnes Ottaway] marrying another woman in ignorance of the 'bridegroom‚Äôs' sex is remarkable enough, but what is to be thought of a couple that keep it up for eight years?‚Äù he asked (NZ Truth, 26 June 1909).Heritage et AL: \\"Her Feminine Bridegroom‚Äù : cross-dressing women in New Zealand history Later life (1911‚Äì1943) Upon her release in 1911, Amy Bock worked at a New Plymouth retirement home, and married Charles Christofferson, a Swedish immigrant, in 1914. Due to Bock's indebtedness, the marriage foundered within that year. By February 1917, she appeared before the New Plymouth Magistrates Court on further fraud charges, and was fined twenty pounds. Fourteen years later, she appeared at the Auckland Supreme Court in October 1931, where she had been remanded to face multiple charges of financial fraud. Bock was given a two-year suspended sentence, conditional on her probationary residence at a Salvation Army home. She complied with the order and settled down in her twilight years. Bock died on 29 August 1943. Bock has had a posthumous career in New Zealand feminist studies, where her active criminal career and gender masquerade have aroused interestFor example, see Fiona Clark's exhibition website on this subject: http://www.fionaclark.com/amy-bock.htmlJenny Coleman: \\"On Lies, Secrets and Silence: The Politics of Evidence and Interpretive Strategies\\" Journal of Lesbian Studies 14: 04: December 2010: 303-318 It is possible that the \\"Percy Redwood\\" masquerade might suggest that she was either lesbian or bisexual, although Agnes Ottway quickly had the marriage annulled when she found out her \\"husband's\\" actual gender. More recently, she has been the subject of a historical autobiography.Jenny Coleman: Mad or Bad?

History hirez\\" artwork. Fire was founded in July 1994 by ANSI artists Donut Hole and Vendetta as a parody of iCE, one of the top art groups of the time. From the second pack onward, the group was ostensibly led by Halaster, who gradually elevated Fire by recruiting talented artists from regional art groups, and by becoming a competent ANSI artist himself. After releasing monthly collections of their work, Fire planned a merger with Canadian artscene group Mistigris, in March 1995. The merger was unsuccessful and Fire collapsed shortly thereafter when Halaster quit the group to join ACiD. In August 1995, Halaster quit ACiD and re-formed Fire. After its rebirth, Fire became a popular and critically successful group, releasing artwork and applications such as the DOS based ANSI editor, Pyrodraw. At various points in time, Fire was home to some of the most respected ANSI artists in the scene, including Iodine, Eerie and Prisoner #1. Through most of its history, Fire was headquartered at The Regency BBS, located in Atlanta's 404 area code. The Regency was one of the few dial-up BBSs that transitioned to IP technology via use of the telnet protocol. This transition was short-lived and only marginally successful, but allowed Fire to retain its headquarters after most BBSs had closed. The Regency's geographic location contributed to the early history of the group, as most of its initial artistic roster hailed from Atlanta. In February 1997, Halaster stepped down from his leadership position and chose hirez artist God Among Lice, coordinator of the hirez section since April 1996, and ANSI artist Eerie to assume his duties of group leader and coordinator of the ANSI section respectively. After just one pack Eerie unexpectedly left the group and German ANSI artist Nail took over coordination of the ANSI section in April 1997, subsequently recruiting more European artists into the group's ranks. However, with the rising popularity of the Internet and dropping interest in ANSI art Fire found itself struggling to stay true to its roots with more and more of its ANSI artists quitting the medium altogether. God Among Lice and Nail eventually decided to end the group after pack #33 rather than keep going and being forced to release packs that they deemed unfitting for Fire, which they ultimately still considered an ANSI art based group. fire #33 - the final combustion was eventually released several months late in September 1998. Other projects Fire had a separate ASCII sub-group called Fire ASCII, but unlike the relationship between ACiD Productions and Remorse ASCII the art was, with just a few exceptions, released in the Fire packs instead of separate ASCII packs. Fire also maintained a separate music/tracking entity called Radiance Coderz Fire had a small crew of coders, headed up by Wintermute aka Winmutt and Maxwell. This group was responsible for creating Pyroview, which was among the first art-scene viewers to support JPEG images. Another of the groups ground breaking creation was a raster based graphics protocol with embedded sound support that was supported in Dialtone! (a serial communications / terminal emulation program) and the System/75 BBS software written for the DOS operating systems. System/75 BBS was a full featured message board and file sharing center. Dialtone! was one of the first serial comm apps to integrate a war dialer with a fully fledged dial comm supporting all of the popular file transfer protocols of the day.

He was a member of the Yale Puppeteers and the driving force behind Turnabout Theatre. He was born in Otsego, Michigan, in 1901 and died in 1996, two days after his 95th birthday. Brown briefly taught at North Carolina State College, followed by an extensive tour of Europe.Gay Love Story review Forman's Yale Puppeteers, which he established upon graduating from University of Michigan (class of 1922), opened a puppet theatre in Los Angeles in 1941 (the Turnabout Theater) that attracted celebrity attention and support from some of Hollywood's biggest names, e.g., Greta Garbo, Marie Dressler, and Douglas Fairbanks, as well as other notable figures including Albert Einstein. Brown wrote all the songs and sketches for the troupe's productions. Regular performers included Elsa Lanchester and Odetta. Bette Midler sang one of Forman's songs, Mrs. Pettibone, at a Los Angeles AIDS benefit. Along with Yale Puppeteers Harry Burnett and Richard Brandon (1905 ‚Äì May 4, 1985) (Brown's lifelong lover), Brown launched Turnabout Theatre in 1941 as \\"a vehicle for performing both puppet plays and revues for adults.\\"A Remembrance of Forman Brown http://www.sagecraft.com/puppetry/bios/FormanBrown.html Turnabout Theatre was a highly popular puppetry venue until its dissolution in 1956. Reversible seats were installed in the theatre so that after the puppet shows were performed at one end of the auditorium, the puppeteers asked the audience to \\"turnabout\\" their seats for the Turnabout revue staged at the opposite end of the auditorium. In 1933, he wrote Better Angel, under the pseudonym Richard Meeker, about a young man coming to terms with his homosexuality. The novel is regarded as \\"the first American novel to present the 'gay' experience in a healthy light.\\" When it was reprinted in 1995, under the assumption that the author was no more alive, Brown stepped forward and acknowledged the novel was heavily autobiographic: the main character, Kurt, was the same Forman Brown; one of the main character's love interests, Derry, was Brown's cousin, Harry Burnett; Kurt's main love interest, David, was Richard Brandon; another of Kurt's lovers, Tony, was actor Alexander Kirkland.

Marcus Antonius Coccius Sabellicus (1436‚Äì1506) was a scholar and historian from Venice. He is known for his universal history, Enneades sive Rhapsodia historiarum. Life Born in Vicovaro, his surname was originally Cocci; he took his Latinised name as a pupil of Pomponius Laetus.Donald Cheney, Brenda Hosington, David K.

Sabellicus became professor of eloquence at Udine in 1473, but was dismissed in 1482. After a short period at Verona, he went to Venice, with the Venetian history he had written speculatively. He was given a teaching position as deputy to Giorgio Valla. In 1487 he was appointed as a curator of the Biblioteca Marciana. Works Sabellicus while at Udine wrote an antiquarian work on Aquileia that appeared in 1482. He then produced a Latin history of Venice, Historiae rerum venetarum ab urbe condita, with official encouragement; but it proved unpopular with the citizens.William J. Bouwsma, Venice and the Defense of Republican Liberty: Renaissance Values in the Age of the Counter Reformation (Berkeley, 1968), p. 90. He wrote further works concerned with Venice, and as a humanist scholar wrote commentaries on classical authors. The Enneades sive Rhapsodia historiarum appeared in 1498. His collected works were published in 1560 at Basel. The Historiae rerum venetarum had a first continuator, Andrea Navagero, who died having asked for his work to be destroyed.

Part of the system's Croton Watershed, it lies within the towns of Bedford, Lewisboro, and Pound Ridge, about 1 mile (1.6 km) east of the village of Katonah, and over north of New York City. It was constructed around the start of the 20th century by impounding the Cross River, a tributary of the Croton River, which eventually flows into the Hudson River. The reservoir was finally put into service in 1908. The resulting body of water is one of 16 (12 reservoirs and 4 controlled lakes) in the Croton Watershed, the southernmost of New York City's watersheds. The reservoir is approximately long, has a drainage basin of 30 square miles (78 km¬≤), and can hold of water at full capacity, making it one of the city's smaller reservoirs. To reach the city, water flows through Cross River into the Muscoot Reservoir, then down that one into the New Croton Reservoir, where it enters the New Croton Aqueduct in Yorktown. Via the aqueduct, it flows into The Bronx, entering the Jerome Park Reservoir. In Manhattan, it meets the Catskill Aqueduct.

Created by William J. Bell as an effort to add more African American characters to the cast, the role was portrayed by Victoria Rowell. Rowell left the role in 2000 to pursue other projects and Alexia Robinson was introduced as Alex Perez, a replacement character, shortly after. Rowell later returned in August 2002. In 2007, Rowell became unhappy with the soap opera behind the scenes, labeling daytime television and The Young and the Restless as racist for not having enough African American cast and crew. She also argued the directions of her storylines which weren't heard, prompting her to leave. Within the storyline, Drucilla fell off a cliff and was presumed dead as her body was never found. Rowell has openly expressed pleasure and willingness to return, and as a result of the character's strong appeal and popularity, viewers have campaigned for the series to rehire her. However, CBS has stated that having Drucilla return is not the creative decision they are looking for, which has disappointed fans of the actress. In 2015, Rowell filed a lawsuit against the soap opera and Sony Pictures Entertainment for retaliation, claiming that she had been blacklisted by the network for speaking out against what she believed was racial discrimination during her time portraying Drucilla. The character is a ballerina-turned- model, with a forward personality and feisty persona. Her storyline revolves around her relationship with Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John), being raped by Neil's brother, Malcolm (Shemar Moore), which resulted in the birth of a daughter, Lily (Christel Khalil), and on-again/off-again relationship with her sister, Olivia (Tonya Lee Williams). Drucilla's rivalries with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson) and Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) (the latter often providing the series' comic relief), and friendships with Brad Carlton (Don Diamont) and Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) have also proved popular as plot points. Casting Victoria Rowell originated the role on May 7, 1990. Dawn McMillan filled in for Rowell while she was on maternity leave from January 26 to February 9, 1996. She left the show on April 2, 1998. She came back for a recurring gig from February to September 2000. During this time, Kent Masters King assumed the role for several episodes. In 2000, Rowell chose to exit the soap opera in order to star in a Showtime miniseries. She returned to the role in August 2002, after a two-year absence. Drucilla's exit in 2007 was not without controversy. She was unhappy about her character, and voiced her opinion about it. Ultimately, Rowell opted to be let out of her regular contract. Months after Drucilla's death, Rowell had an interview with Black Press Magazine. She explained her reasonings for leaving: \\"We have the most popular daytime show and the number one show for African Americans, hands down. Yet, there are no black writers, there are no black producers, there are no black directors. There are no Black make up artists. There are no Black hairstylists.\\" Rowell went on to say that to get any attention or recognition, she had to write her own script for it to be comfortable with her. She had pointed out signs of racism, as she was a top actress for her work on The Young and the Restless yet had failed to secure many Daytime Emmy Nominations, and never won once. Rowell even expressed her displeasure with the situation on social networking site Twitter, too. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest prior to her final airdate, Rowell stated: In the same interview, she had revealed that accomplished and central actors on the soap opera such as Eric Braeden, who portrays Victor Newman, had asked her to stay. Rowell said that she tweaked her script to give Dru a voice, but explained that \\"everything happens for a reason and where I couldn't exercise that particular artistic expression with Y&R.;\\" Since her departure, speculation has arisen multiple times that Rowell would return at some point, but this has never materialized. In February 2015, Rowell sued The Young and the Restless and Sony Pictures Entertainment for retaliation, alleging that she was blacklisted by the network and production company due to her speaking out against lack of diversity on and behind the cameras at the soap opera. Rowell also alleged in her suit that she faced years of racial discrimination during her time on the series, and was denied writing and directing opportunities which have been granted to Caucasian actors. Storylines =Backstory= Drucilla \\"Dru\\" Barber runs away from home as a teenager, due to her problematic relationship with her mother, Lillie Belle (Norma Donaldson), and goes to stay with her aunt Mamie Johnson (Veronica Redd) who is a housekeeper for Jabot Cosmetics founder John Abbott, Sr. In doing so, she sacrifices her opportunity for a promising career as a ballerina. =1990‚Äì2000= Dru is illiterate, but is taught to read by private detective Nathan Hastings (who was once also illiterate). Nathan later marries and fathers a child by Dru's successful physician sister Olivia. Drucilla and Olivia originally have a relationship fraught with tension and anger, due to mother Lillie Belle's favoritism of Olivia over Drucilla. She admitted many years later that Dru was an unwanted child, the result of husband Walter's drunken lust. It was no wonder that Dru ran away as a teenager and spent years on the streets racking up a criminal record. Olivia was shocked by this revelation, needless to say and saw Dru in a new light for the first time in years. Walter assured Olivia that even though Dru's conception was not planned, he loved her regardless and had no regrets over having her. Olivia was relieved and grateful to hear this, but was furious with Lillie Belle for mistreating Dru all those years, leading the two sisters to reconcile in a very emotional manner and they have had a loving relationship ever since. Dru eventually marries Neil Winters, but only after many trials and mistakes. One such misstep, is posing nude for a magazine, though Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) discovers and destroys the film. Over time, Dru eventually evolves into a glamorous model. In June 1993, after marrying Neil, Drucilla finally receives closure by telling off her mother for wanting to abort her and not showing love for her as a child. Dru becomes close with Neil's brother Malcolm Winters, who develops a crush on her. While she is under the influence of cold medication, Malcolm rapes her knowing she believed him to be her husband. When she ends up pregnant they decide not to uncover the child's paternity and keep their affair a secret. Dru gives birth to her daughter, Lily, in 1995. Dru's marriage to Neil ultimately collapses because her desire for a career clashes with his desire for a wife who stayed home. Dru develops very close friendships with people in town, including Brad Carlton (Don Diamont), Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), Victor Newman (Eric Braeden), and Jack and Ashley Abbott (Peter Bergman and Eileen Davidson). She develops an adversarial relationship with Phyllis Romalotti (Michelle Stafford), which only intensifies as the years go on. Dru and Lily move to Europe where Dru continues her modeling career. =2002‚Äì07= Dru and Lily return to Genoa City for brief visits until 2002 when they come back to stay. Dru comes back hoping for help in reining in their now 14-year-old daughter Lily (Christel Khalil). Instead, it is Lily and Dru who end up helping Neil deal with his drinking problem. Neil and Dru fall back in love and remarry in Japan in 2003. Dru and Neil became swamped with work, leaving Lily with a lot of time to get into trouble. Although Lily ran into the arms of Kevin Fisher, who ended up using her, Neil and Dru were able to work together and save their daughter from losing more than her virginity. Dru went on to help out troubled teen Devon Hamilton, and convinced Neil to become Devon's foster parents. Miraculously, Neil's brother Malcolm returned from the dead after surviving the car accident, which everyone thought had been his demise. After much protest from Dru, Malcolm demanded a paternity test on Lily, which proved her to be Malcolm's biological daughter. Again, they agreed to keep the secret from Neil. To make matters worse, Lily ran off and married Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei). In 2006, Neil and Lily (Davetta Sherwood) learn the truth about her paternity. Neil wonders if he will ever be able to forgive Dru for her betrayal, and begins a flirtation with Carmen Mesta (Marisa Ramirez). Dru shows up at an important Newman function, gets drunk and slanders Carmen Mesta in front of everyone. She later lies her way into Carmen's hotel room and ruins many of Carmen Mesta's expensive clothes. Drucilla attacks Carmen in the office at Newman Enterprises. The entire attack is caught on a video tape found by Phyllis, who gives a copy to Carmen. After Carmen gives copies of the tape to the district attorney and her former lover David Chow (Vincent Irizarry), Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle) is forced to fire Drucilla. Dru is arrested, and though Neil is very much attracted to Carmen, he ends their relationship to stand by his wife. Dru ends up receiving probation for her crimes, and court ordered therapy. Dru's attention shifts to focus on Indigo, a night club she and Neil are opening. The night it opens, Carmen is murdered and her body is discovered behind the club. Dru's adopted son Devon Hamilton (Bryton James) is arrested for the crime, and Drucilla believes her sanity is crumbling as she begins to see Carmen around town. Drucilla is convinced that Carmen is still alive, and after accidentally injuring her daughter, Neil has her voluntarily committed to a mental hospital. After Devon is cleared of all charges, it is revealed that Carmen's former lover David and her look alike cousin Ines are responsible for the hauntings that sent Dru over the edge and Crimson Lights worker Jana Hawkes (Emily O'Brien) is responsible for Carmen's death. Things are looking up for the family, as Neil receives a promotion to the board of directors at Newman Enterprises, Dru regains her job, and Lily and Devon receive high marks in their college courses. After Sharon asks Dru to be her maid of honor at her upcoming wedding to Jack, Dru accompanies her and their mutual enemy Phyllis to a cliff side photo shoot for NVP. When Phyllis threatens to use her cell phone to reveal Sharon's affair with Brad to their friends and family, Dru reaches for Phyllis' cell phone, and a brief struggle with Phyllis causes both Dru and Sharon to fall off the cliff; immediately sending Dru into the shallow waters below. Sharon hangs on to Phyllis as she, Lily and Daniel try to pull her up, but Sharon lets go and she too falls off the cliff. An injured Sharon is later found, but search and rescue teams only find the remains of Dru's jacket. Her body is never recovered, and she is presumed dead.

A hardliner is a person holding such views. The stance is usually far from the centrist view. People, policies, and laws can be considered hard-line. A hardliner may be either a reactionary or a revolutionary. Synonyms for hardliner include diehard, hawk, extremist, fanatic, or zealot. The term is almost always relative to the Overton window of a given time and place.  Examples by country  = France = The French government has taken a hard-line stance against terrorism. France removed restrictions on raiding houses of suspected terrorists, although only five cases have been brought to court while over four thousand searches were conducted. Critics say the approach unfairly blames the Muslim community for radical extremists. = Iran = Ebrahim Raisi, a Shi'ite cleric and prominent politician, ran as a hard-line challenger to President Rouhani in 2017 and was Rouhani's main challenger. He ran primarily on economic reforms and increasing distance with the West. = Russia = After increased sanctions by Western countries, a poll from 2016 recorded that fifty-nine percent of Russians did not want their government to change its behavior. The respondents felt that either Westerns wanted to harm Russia, hold it to standards they did not live up to, or were simply ignorant of Russian reasoning for actions. = United Kingdom = Brexit is a hard-line position on relations with the European Union. The United Kingdoms voted to leave the European Union to preserve its sovereignty, which was dubbed Brexit. After the vote, the two top searches on Google about the European Union were the implications of leaving the European Union and what \\"EU\\" (short for European Union) meant. = United States = One of the more common issues that uses hard-line or hardliner as a description is illegal immigration. For example, the United States House of Representatives had two bills in June 2018 about immigration to consider: the hard-line and centrist options. The House failed to pass the centrist bill. The House did not vote on the more extreme bill.  Words implying hard-line stances  = Hawk = A hawk is someone who prefers an extreme or aggressive stance, typically on war. When referring to war, a hawk is always in favor of war. The opposite is a dove, who prefers peace. However, the term hawk can also be used for other issues, like the deficit. John McCain, the American senator and 2008 presidential nominee was a [war] hawk because of his policies on the Middle East. A current example of a hawk is John R. Bolton, who was the national security advisor for President Trump.

The family comprises 83 genera with about 1,660 known species. Together with the Platanaceae and Nelumbonaceae, they make up the order Proteales. Well-known genera include Protea, Banksia, Embothrium, Grevillea, Hakea and Macadamia. Species such as the New South Wales waratah (Telopea speciosissima), king protea (Protea cynaroides), and various species of Banksia, Grevillea, and Leucadendron are popular cut flowers, while the nuts of Macadamia integrifolia are widely grown commercially and consumed. Australia and South Africa have the greatest concentrations of diversity. Etymology The name Proteaceae by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789 was based on the genus Protea, which in 1767 Carl Linnaeus derived from the name of the Greek god Proteus, a deity who was able to change between many forms.Jussieu, Antoine Laurent de, Genera plantarum secundum ordines naturales disposita, juxta methodum in Horto Regio Parisiensi exaratum, anno M.DCC.LXXIV. Paris, 1789. pp. 78-80. This is an appropriate image, seeing as the family is known for its astonishing variety and diversity of flowers and leaves.  Description  Rhopala heterophylla The genera of Proteaceae are highly varied, with Banksia in particular providing a striking example of adaptive radiation in plants. This variability makes it impossible to provide a simple, diagnostic identification key for the family, although individual genera may be easily identified. * Proteaceae range from prostrate shrubs to tall forest trees, of 40 m in height, and are usually of medium height or low or perennial shrubs, except for some Stirlingia species that are herbs. Some species are facultatively deciduous (Embothrium coccineum), rarely acaulescent, the cauline portion of the collar is often thickened (lignotuber). Indumentum of three-celled hairs, sometimes glandular, rarely absent, the apical cell is usually elongated, acute, sometimes equally or unequally bifid. * Leaves rarely aromatic, usually alternate, and in a spiral, rarely opposed, or verticilate; coriaceous, rarely fleshy or spinescent, simple or compound (imparipinate, imparibipinate or rarely palmate or digitate with pinnatisect segments), entire edge to (3-)pinnatisect (giving a fern-like aspect); rarely divided dichotomously, often remotely toothed, crenate or serrated, seated or stalked; the petiole frequently with a swollen base but rarely sheathed (sometimes in Synaphea), without stipules; pinnate sometimes palmate or parallel venation, brochidodromous or reduced to a single prominent vane, vernation normally conduplicate; anisophylly often occurs during the different growth periods; leaf blade dorsiventral, isobilateral or centred; mesophyll tissue usually with sclerenchymatous idioblasts, rare secretory cavities. Brachy-paracytic stomata (laterocytic in Bellendena). Plant stems with two types of radii, wide and multi-serrated or narrow and uni-serrated, phloem stratified or not, trilacunar nodes with three leaf traces (rarely unilacunar with one trace), sclereids frequent; bark with lenticels frequently horizontally enlarged, cork cambium present, usually superficial. Roots lateral and short, often grouped in bundles (proteoid roots) with very dense root hairs, rarely with mycorrhiza. * Plants usually hermaphroditic, more rarely monoecious, dioecious or andromonoecious. * Inflorescences very variable, simple or compound, axillary or terminal, lateral flowers solitary or in pairs, rarely with a terminal flower, racemiform, paniculate or condensed, usually with bracts, sometimes converted into leaves or squamiform, forming a type of cone, or with bright colours, forming an involucre or pseudanthium, the peduncles and pedicels sometimes contracted, compacted with the rachis, in some cases the congested inflorescences form super inflorescences (some Alloxylon); very rarely the flowers are solitary and axillary near the end of branches; in species with lignotubers the flowers sometimes grow from these and pass through the soil (geophytes). * Flowers are usually perfect, actinomorphic, or zygomorphic, hypogynous, frequently large and showy. Flat or oblique, sometimes forming a gynophore. Hypogynous disk present and extrastaminal or absent. Perianth of (3-)4(-8) tepals (sometimes interpreted as a dimerous and dichlamydeous perianth), in 1(-2) valvate whorls, sometimes elongated in a basal sack, free or fused in different ways (all fused or even one free and three basally to completely fused), or even connivent by marginally interdigitate papillae forming a tube or a bilabiate structure, zygomorphic, sometimes opening laterally in a variety of ways. Haplostemonous androecium, usually isostemonous, opposititepalous of (3-)4(-5) stamens, all fertile or some converted into staminodes, usually filamentous, filaments partially or totally fused to the tepals, rarely free, basifixed anthers adnate, ditheous, tetrasporangiate, sometimes unilocular and bisporagiate, introrse to latrorse (rarely), expanded connective, usually with apiculus, dehiscence along longitudinal tears. Hypogynous glands (0-)1-4, squamiform or elongated, fleshy, free or fused forming a lunate or annular nectary over the receptacle. Superior gynoecium of 1(-2) apocarpous carpels, sessile or stipitate (with a more or less elongated gynophore), sometimes not completely closed, style usually developed, stigma small or in the shape of a terminal or sub terminal disk or even lateral and oblique, often indented, papilous, moist or dry, ovules 1-100 or more per carpel, anatropous, hemianatropous, amphitropous or orthotropous, mostly hemitropous, bitegmic, crassinucellate, chalaza with a ring of vascular bundles, the funiculus is occasionally absent and the ovule is fused to the placenta, marginal placentation with various dispositions or apical. * Fruit dehiscent or indehiscent, in achene or nucule, follicle, drupe (with lignified endocarp) or falsely drupal (with lignified internal mesocarp), sometimes similar to a caryopsis as it is fused to the wall of the ovary and the testa, often lignified and serotinous; the fruit from the same inflorescence are sometimes fused forming a syncarp. * Seeds 1-many, sometimes winged, flat to rounded, with endosperm absent, present in Bellendina, endotesta with an unusual layer containing crystals of calcium oxalate that is rarely absent, well differentiated embryo, straight, dicotyledonous, but often with 3 or more (up to 9) large cotyledons, often auriculate. * Pollen in monads, triangular in polar view, (2-)3(-8)-aperturate, usually isopolar and triporate, biporate in Embothrium and the tribe Banksieae, colpoidate in Beauprea, spherical in Aulax and Franklandia or strongly anisopolar in some species of Persoonia; the openings of the former's tetrads follow Garside's Law. * Chromosomal number: n = 5, 7, 10‚Äì14, 26, 28; sizes range from very small (average of 1,0 Œºm) to very big (average of 14,4 Œºm) according to species; x = 7, 12. Flowers thumbright Inflorescence and leaves of the pin-cushion hakea (Hakea laurina) Generally speaking, the diagnostic feature of Proteaceae is the compound flower head or, more accurately, inflorescence. In many genera, the most obvious feature is the large and often very showy inflorescences, consisting of many small flowers densely packed into a compact head or spike. Even this character, however, does not occur in all Proteaceae; Adenanthos species, for example, have solitary flowers. In most Proteaceae species, the pollination mechanism is highly specialised. It usually involves the use of a \\"pollen- presenter\\", an area on the style-end that presents the pollen to the pollinator. Proteaceae flower parts occur in fours, but the four tepals are fused into a long, narrow tube with a closed cup at the top, and the filaments of the four stamens are fused to the tepals, in such a way that the anthers are enclosed within the cup. The pistil initially passes along the inside of the perianth tube, so the stigma, too, is enclosed within the cup. As the flower develops, the pistil grows rapidly. Since the stigma is trapped, the style must bend to elongate, and eventually it bends so far, it splits the perianth along one seam. The style continues to grow until anthesis, when the nectaries begin to produce nectar. At this time, the perianth splits into its component tepals, the cup splits apart, and the pistil is released to spring more or less upright.  Ecology  Inflorescence of Protea caffra Many of the Proteaceae have specialised proteoid roots, masses of lateral roots and hairs forming a radial absorptive surface, produced in the leaf litter layer during seasonal growth, and usually shrivelling at the end of the growth season. They are an adaptation to growth in poor, phosphorus-deficient soils, greatly increasing the plants' access to scarce water and nutrients by exuding carboxylates that mobilise previously unavailable phosphorus. They also increase the root's absorption surface, but this is a minor feature, as it also increases competition for nutrients against its own root clusters. However, this adaptation leaves them highly vulnerable to dieback caused by the Phytophthora cinnamomi water mould, and generally intolerant of fertilization. Due to these specialized proteoid roots, the Proteaceae are one of few flowering plant families that do not form symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. They exude large amounts of organic acids (citric acid and malic acid) every 2‚Äì3 days in order to aid the mobilization and absorption of phosphate. Many species are fire-adapted (pyrophytes), meaning they have strategies for surviving fires that sweep through their habitat. Some are resprouters, and have a thick rootstock buried in the ground that shoots up new stems after a fire, and others are reseeders, meaning the adult plants are killed by the fire, but disperse their seeds, which are stimulated by the smoke to take root and grow. The heat was previously thought to have stimulated growth, but the chemicals in the smoke have now been shown to cause it. There are four dioecious genera (Aulax, Dilobeia, Heliciopsis and Leucadendron), 11 andromonoecious genera and some other genera have species that are cryptically andromonoecious: two species are sterile and only reproduce vegetatively (Lomatia tasmanica, Hakea pulvinifera). The species vary between being autocompatible and autoincompatible, with intermediate situations; these situations sometimes occur in the same species. The flowers are usually protandrous. Just before anthesis, the anthers release their pollen, depositing it onto the stigma, which in many cases has an enlarged fleshy area specifically for the deposition of its own pollen. Nectar-feeders are unlikely to come into contact with the anthers themselves, but can hardly avoid contacting the stigma; thus, the stigma functions as a pollen-presenter, ensuring the nectar-feeders act as pollinators. The downside of this pollination strategy is that the probability of self-fertilisation is greatly increased; many Proteaceae counter this with strategies such as protandry, self-incompatibility, or preferential abortion of selfed seed. The systems for presenting pollen are usually highly diverse, corresponding to the diversification of the pollinators. Pollination is carried out by bees, beetles, flies, moths, birds (honeyeaters, sunbirds, sugarbirds and hummingbirds) and mammals (rodents, small marsupials, elephant shrews and bats. The latter two means were evolutionarily derived from entomophily in different, independent events. The dispersion of some species exhibit the curious phenomenon of serotiny, which is associated with their pyrophytic behaviour: these trees accumulate fruits on their branches whose outer layers or protective structures (bracts) are highly lignified and resistant to fire. The fruit only release their seeds when they have been burnt and when the ground has been fertilized with ashes from the fire and is free from competitors. Many species have seeds with elaiosomes that are dispersed by ants; the seeds with wings or thistledown exhibit anemochory, while the drupes and other fleshy fruit exhibit endozoochory as mammals and birds ingest them. Some African and Australian rodents are known to accumulate fruit and seeds of these plants in their nests in order to feed on them, although some manage to germinate. Distribution  Proteaceae are mainly a Southern Hemisphere family, with its main centres of diversity in Australia and South Africa. It also occurs in Central Africa, South and Central America, India, eastern and south eastern Asia, and Oceania. Only two species are known from New Zealand, although fossil pollen evidence suggests there were more previously. It is a good example of a Gondwanan family, with taxa occurring on virtually every land mass considered a remnant of the ancient supercontinent Gondwana, except Antarctica. The family and subfamilies are thought to have diversified well before the fragmentation of Gondwana, implying all of them are well over 90 million years old. Evidence for this includes an abundance of proteaceous pollen found in the Cretaceous coal deposits of the South Island of New Zealand. It is thought to have achieved its present distribution largely by continental drift rather than dispersal across ocean gaps.  Phytochemistry  Fruit of Brabejum stellatifolium No conclusive studies have been carried out on the chemical substances present in this broad family. The genera Protea and Faurea are unusual as they use xylose as the main sugar in their nectar and as they have high concentrations of polygalactol, while sucrose is the main sugar present in Grevillea. Cyanogenic glycosides, derived from tyrosine, are often present, as are proanthocyanidines (delphinidin and cyanidin), flavonols (kaempferol, quercetin and myricetin) and arbutin. Alkaloids are usually absent. Iridoids and ellagic acid are also absent. Saponins and sapogenins can be either present or absent in different species. Many species accumulate aluminium. Leucadendron argenteum  Uses and cultivation  Edible nuts of Macadamia Many traditional cultures have used Proteaceae as sustenance, medicine, for curing animal hides, as a source of dyes, firewood and as wood for construction. Aboriginal Australians eat the fruit of Persoonia, and the seeds of species from other genera, including Gevuina and Macadamia, form part of the diet of the indigenous peoples but are also sold throughout the world. The tender shoots of Helicia species are used in Java, and the nectar from the inflorescences of a number of species is drunk in Australia. Traditional medicines can be obtained from infusions of the roots, bark, leaves, or flowers of many species that are used as topical applications for skin conditions or internally as tonics, aphrodisiacs, and galactogens to treat headaches, cough, dysentery, diarrhea, indigestion, stomach ulcers, and kidney disease. The wood from the trees of this family is widely used in construction and for internal uses such as decoration; the wood from species of Protea, Leucadendron and Grevillea is especially popular. Many species are used in gardening, particularly genera of Banksia, Embothrium, Grevillea, and Telopea. Unfortunately, this use has resulted in the introduction of exotic species that have become invasive; examples include the hakea willow (Hakea salicifolia) and the silky hakea (Hakea sericea) in Portugal. Two species of Macadamia are cultivated commercially for their edible nuts. Gevuina avellana (Chilean hazel) is cultivated for its edible nuts in Chile and New Zealand, and they are also used in the pharmaceutical industry for their humectant properties and as an ingredient in sunscreens. It is the most resistant to cold of the tree families that produce nuts. It is also planted in the British Isles and on the Pacific coast of the United States for its tropical appearance and its ability to grow in cooler climates. Many Proteaceae species are cultivated by the nursery industry as barrier plants and for their prominent and distinctive flowers and foliage. Some species are of importance to the cut flower industry, especially some Banksia and Protea species. Two species of the genus Macadamia are grown commercially for edible nuts. Sugarbushes (Protea), pincushions (Leucospermum) and conebushes (Leucadendron), as well as others like pagodas (Mimetes), Aulax and blushing brides (Serruria), comprise one of the three main plant groups of fynbos, which forms part of the Cape Floral Kingdom, the smallest but richest plant kingdom for its size and the only kingdom contained within a single country. The other main groups of plants in fynbos are the Ericaceae and the Restionaceae. South African proteas are thus widely cultivated due to their many varied forms and unusual flowers. They are popular in South Africa for their beauty and their usefulness in wildlife gardens for attracting birds and useful insects. The species most valued as ornamentals are the trees that grow in southern latitudes as they give landscapes in temperate climates a tropical appearance; Lomatia ferruginea (Fuinque), Lomatia hirsuta (Radal) have been introduced in Western Europe and to the western United States. Embothrium coccineum (Chilean Firetree or Notro) is highly valued in the British Isles for its dark red flowers and can be found as far north as the Faroe Islands at a latitude of 62¬∞ north. Among the banksias, many of which grow in temperate and Mediterranean climates, the vast majority are shrubs; only a few are trees that are valued for their height. Among the tallest species are: B. integrifolia with its subspecies B. integrifolia subsp. monticola, which is noteworthy as the plants that form the subspecies are the tallest trees of the banksias and they are the more frost-resistant than other banksias, B. seminuda, B. littoralis, B. serrata; among those that can be considered small trees or large shrubs: B. grandis, B. prionotes, B. marginata, B. coccinea and B. speciosa; all of these are planted in parks and gardens and even along roadsides because of their size. The rest of the species of this genus, around 170 species, are shrubs, although some of them are valued for their flowers. Another species that is cultivated in some parts of the world, although it is smaller, is Telopea speciosissima (Waratah), from the mountains of New South Wales, Australia. Some temperate climate species are cultivated more locally in Australia for their attractive appearance: Persoonia pinifolia (pine-leaved geebung) is valued for its vivid yellow flowers and grape-like fruit. Adenanthos sericeus (woolly bush) is planted for its attractive soft leaves and its small red or orange flowers. Hicksbeachia pinnatifolia (beef nut, red bauple nut) is commonly planted for its foliage and edible nuts.  Parasites  Hakea purpurea The Proteaceae are particularly susceptible to certain parasites, in particular the oomycete Phytophthora cinnamomi, which causes severe root rot in the plants that grow in Mediterranean climates. Fusarium oxysporum causes a disease called fusariosis in roots that causes a yellowing and wilting, with serious ecological damages to woodland plants and economic losses in plants of commercial interest. Other common infections are caused by species of Botryosphaeria, Rhizoctonia, Armillaria, Botrytis, Calonectria and other fungi.  Conservation status  The IUCNIUCN 2006. 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. . Downloaded on 22 February 2007 considers that 47 Proteaceae species are threatened, of which one species, Stenocarpus dumbeensis Guillaumin, 1935, from New Caledonia, is thought to be extinct. The species of this family are particularly susceptible to the destruction or fragmentation of their habitat, fire, parasitic diseases, competition from introduced plants, soil degradation and other damage provoked by humans and their domesticated animals. The species are also affected by climate change.  Fossils  Lambertia multiflora The proteaceae have a rich fossil record, despite the inherent difficulties in identifying remains that do not show diagnostic characteristics. Identification usually comes from using a combination of brachy-paracytic stomata and the unusual trichome bases or, in other cases, the unusual structure of pollen tetrads. Fossils attributable to this family have been found on the majority of areas that formed the Gondwana supercontinent. A wide variety of pollen belonging to this family dating back to the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian-Maastrichtian) from the south east of Australia and pollen from the Middle Cretaceous (Cenomanian-Turonian) from northern Africa and Peru described as Triorites africaensis. The first macrofossils appear twenty million years later in the Palaeocene of South America and the north east of Australia. The fossil record of some areas, such as New Zealand and Tasmania, show a greater biodiversity for Proteaceae than currently exists, which supports the fact that the distribution of many taxa has changed drastically with the passage of time and that the family has suffered a general decline, including high levels of extinction during the Cenozoic. Taxonomy Isopogon anemonifolius First described by French botanist Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, the family Proteaceae is a fairly large one, with around 80 genera, but less than 2000 species. It is recognised by virtually all taxonomists. Firmly established under classical Linnaean taxonomy, it is also recognised by the cladistics-based APG and APG II systems. It is placed in the order Proteales, whose placement has itself varied. A classification of the genera within Proteaceae was made by Lawrie Johnson and Barbara Briggs in their influential 1975 monograph \\"On the Proteaceae: the evolution and classification of a southern family\\", until it was largely superseded by the molecular studies of Peter H. Weston and Nigel Barker in 2006. Proteaceae are now divided into five subfamilies: Bellendenoideae, Persoonioideae, Symphionematoideae, Proteoideae and Grevilleoideae. In 2008 Mast and colleagues updated Macadamia and related genera in tribe Macadamieae. Furthermore, Orites megacarpus was found not to be within the genus Orites, nor in the tribe Roupaleae, instead in the tribe Macadamieae, hence given the new species name Nothorites megacarpus. The full arrangement, according to Weston and Barker (2006) with the updates to genera from Mast et al. (2008), is as follows: Flowers, leaves and fruit of Banksia coccinea, from Ferdinand Bauer's 1813 flora Illustrationes Florae Novae Hollandiae :Family Proteaceae ::Subfamily Bellendenoideae :::::Bellendena ::Subfamily Persoonioideae :::Tribe Placospermeae :::::Placospermum :::Tribe Persoonieae :::::Toronia ‚Äî Garnieria ‚Äî Acidonia ‚Äî Persoonia ::Subfamily Symphionematoideae :::::Agastachys ‚Äî Symphionema ::Subfamily Proteoideae :::incertae sedis :::::Eidothea ‚Äî Beauprea ‚Äî Beaupreopsis ‚Äî Dilobeia ‚Äî Cenarrhenes ‚Äî Franklandia :::Tribe Conospermeae ::::Subtribe Stirlingiinae :::::Stirlingia ::::Subtribe Conosperminae :::::Conospermum ‚Äî Synaphea :::Tribe Petrophileae :::::Petrophile ‚Äî Aulax :::Tribe Proteeae :::::Protea ‚Äî Faurea :::Tribe Leucadendreae ::::Subtribe Isopogoninae :::::Isopogon ::::Subtribe Adenanthinae :::::Adenanthos ::::Subtribe Leucadendrinae :::::Leucadendron ‚Äî Serruria ‚Äî Paranomus ‚Äî Vexatorella ‚Äî Sorocephalus ‚Äî Spatalla ‚Äî Leucospermum ‚Äî Mimetes ‚Äî Diastella ‚Äî Orothamnus ::Subfamily Grevilleoideae :::incertae sedis :::::Sphalmium ‚Äî Carnarvonia :::Tribe Roupaleae ::::incertae sedis :::::Megahertzia ‚Äî Knightia ‚Äî Eucarpha ‚Äî Triunia ::::Subtribe Roupalinae :::::Roupala ‚Äî Neorites ‚Äî Orites ::::Subtribe Lambertiinae :::::Lambertia ‚Äî Xylomelum ::::Subtribe Heliciinae :::::Helicia ‚Äî Hollandaea ::::Subtribe Floydiinae :::::Darlingia ‚Äî Floydia :::Tribe Banksieae ::::Subtribe Musgraveinae :::::Musgravea ‚Äî Austromuellera ::::Subtribe Banksiinae :::::Banksia :::Tribe Embothrieae ::::Subtribe Lomatiinae :::::Lomatia ::::Subtribe Embothriinae :::::Embothrium ‚Äî Oreocallis ‚Äî Alloxylon ‚Äî Telopea ::::Subtribe Stenocarpinae :::::Stenocarpus ‚Äî Strangea ::::Subtribe Hakeinae :::::Opisthiolepis ‚Äî Buckinghamia ‚Äî Hakea ‚Äî Grevillea ‚Äî Finschia :::Tribe Macadamieae ::::Subtribe Macadamiinae :::::Macadamia ‚Äî Lasjia ‚Äî Nothorites ‚Äî Panopsis ‚Äî Brabejum ::::Subtribe Malagasiinae :::::Malagasia ‚Äî Catalepidia ::::Subtribe Virotiinae :::::Virotia ‚Äî Athertonia ‚Äî Heliciopsis ::::Subtribe Gevuininae :::::Cardwellia ‚Äî Sleumerodendron ‚Äî Euplassa ‚Äî Gevuina ‚Äî Bleasdalea ‚Äî Hicksbeachia ‚Äî Kermadecia ‚Äî Turrillia  References   * Brown, R.

It details the squire- and knighthood of Alanna of Trebond, who has hidden her real sex in order to become a knight. Plot introduction Alanna, now squire to Prince Jonathan of Conte, has to protect her dreams of knighthood and friends through their first war with Tusaine. She slowly learns more about her gift, using it primarily to heal, and continues to hide her true gender while both George and Jon have fallen in love with her. She continues to be suspicious of and protect Jon from his power-mad first cousin, Roger, on the way to her becoming a full-fledged knight. Plot summary While camping in the woods on her way back to Corus from an errand, Alanna's campsite, set up under a willow tree, is discovered by a small black cat whom she names Faithful. It does not escape Alanna's notice that his eyes are as purple as her own; she also finds out that Faithful can talk to her, although to others it sounds as if he is meowing. Soon after, the Great Mother Goddess, Alanna's patron, shows up at her campfire. She gives Alanna an amulet that allows the young woman to see magic being worked around her. As she progresses into knighthood, Alanna's feminine side is nurtured as well. After a few visits with Eleni, George Cooper's mother, Alanna realizes that part of her wants to act like the ladies she sees in the Court. Eleni takes Alanna under her wing and secretly teaches her how to dress and behave like a woman. The change does not go unnoticed by George or Prince Jonathan, the only two friends with whom she has shared her secret about her sex. Jon and Alanna share their first kiss after he rescues her when she is kidnapped by nobles from Tusaine, and they become lovers soon after, although George made it clear to Alanna that he loved her before they went to war. Alanna withstands the Ordeal of Knighthood and becomes a knight. Her twin brother, Thom, presents her with a shield featuring the crest of their home estate, Trebond. When he and Alanna are alone after the ceremony, he shows her that when she is ready to reveal to everyone that she is a woman, the Trebond crest will disappear, and in its place will be the picture of a golden Lioness rearing on a field of red. Alanna discovers her long-time nemesis, Duke Roger of Conte, her prince's cousin, has a plan to kill the king, queen, Jonathan, and even Alanna herself in order to take the throne. After her knighthood, Alanna accuses Roger publicly and he demands a duel. During the duel, he accidentally slices through the special corset Alanna wears to keep her breasts flat, revealing to everyone that she is very much a woman. Her friends, including Jonathan and Myles, step up and tell the king that they knew beforehand that she was a female. Driven to rage at being challenged by a woman, Roger attacks and attempts to use an illusion to confuse Alanna. She uses the amulet given to her by the Goddess in the beginning of the novel and, spotting the deception, is able to defeat and kill Roger. After her battle, Alanna decides not to stick around to deal with the initial uproar over her sex.

It was formed in 2006 from the takeover and merger of Arcelor by Indian-owned Mittal Steel. ArcelorMittal is the world's largest steel producer, with an annual crude steel production of 92.5 million metric tonnes . It is ranked 120th in the 2019 Fortune Global 500 ranking of the world's largest corporations. History See history of ArcelorMittal (including history of ISPAT International and LNM Holdings) for 1989 onwards =2006-2008: Formation and scalebacks= ArcelorMittal was created by the takeover of Western European steel maker Arcelor (Spain, France, and Luxembourg) by Indian-owned multinational steel maker Mittal Steel in 2006, at a cost of ‚Ç¨40.37 per share, approximately $33 billion total. Mittal Steel launched a hostile takeover bid, which replaced a previous planned merger between Arcelor and Severstal that had lacked sufficient shareholder approval. The resulting merged business was named ArcelorMittal and was headquartered in Luxembourg City. The resulting firm produced approximately 10% of the world's steel, and was by far the world's largest steel company. Total revenues in 2007 were $105 billion. The company earned revenues of $105 billion in 2007. By February 2008, the company had 320,000 employees in 60 countries. In October 2008, the market capitalisation of ArcelorMittal was over $30 billion, after peaking at $32.5 billion in September 2008. At the end of 2008, the company reported operating income of around $12 billion. In December 2008, ArcelorMittal announced several plant closings, including the Bethlehem Steel plant in Lackawanna, New York, and LTV Steel in Hennepin, Illinois. After purchase of Kryvorizhstal, Ukraine's largest steel producer, employment was scaled back from 57,000 employees to 30,000. =2011-2014: Losses and Senegal agreement= In 2010, the company's operating income had fallen to $4.9 billion, with sales down 10 percent from the year earlier, and income down 50 percent as steel prices slumped. In 2011, the company began curtailing its European production to match the reduced demand for steel. It also sold Skyline Steel and Astralloy to a rival, Nucor, for $605 million. On 26 January 2011, the stainless steel division split off as a new company, Aperam. , due to overcapacity and reduced demand in Europe, it had idled 9 of 25 blast furnaces; in October 2012 it permanently shut down two blast furnaces at Florange, France. On 31 October 2012, the company reported a third-quarter loss of $709 million as compared to a $659 million profit for the same period a year ago, citing the slow down in China's economy. In 2012 ArcelorMittal had $22 billion of debt. In January 2013, ArcelorMittal bid $1.5 billion to acquire ThyssenKrupp AG's rolling mill in Calvert, Alabama, United States. On 26 February 2014, ThyssenKrupp sold their Calvert carbon steel facility to ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel for $1.55 billion, as a new joint venture. The facility was renamed AM/NS Calvert through the 50/50 joint partnership with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. The firm also entered into a $2.2 billion contract to develop an iron ore deposit in Senegal. This included construction of a railway line. After it stalled on the contract and failed to build according to schedule, the Government of Senegal sued. In September 2013, the government of Senegal won a court case before an international tribunal to rescind a $2.2 billion deal with ArcelorMittal after the company suspended work on an iron ore mine in the country. In June 2014, the International Chamber of Commerce's arbitration court in Paris awarded Senegal $150 million. Dealing with price and demand fluctuations in the steel market, from 2012 to 2014 ArcelorMittal restructured its European division by reducing employee numbers and closing plants. In May 2014, ArcelorMittal, citing economic self-interest, declared its opposition to sanctions on Russia. As of June 2014, ArcelorMittal accounted for 7 percent of world steel production. After being shut out of the Chinese steel industry in 2005, along with other foreign companies, in 2014 the company announced it was planning new plants in China. In 2014, the company had an annual crude steel production of 98.1 million tons. =2008-2016: Price fixing convictions= Following an investigation first launched in 2008, in August 2016 the South African Competition Commission found the company guilty of price fixing. ArcelorMittal was fined US$110.9 million and, as part of the settlement, also agreed to invest R4.64 billion in capital over five years. According to the findings, the firm had been part of a 17-member-steel group nicknamed \\"Club Z√ºrich\\", that later became known as \\"Club Europe.\\" Between January 1984 and September 2002, the companies fixed the market, prices, and exchanged confidential corporate information. =2015-2016: Recent acquisitions= In 2015, the company had a net loss of $7.9 billion. Between February 2015 and February 2016, share value dropped 60%, making the company the \\"worst performer\\" in the FTSEurofirst300 index. The CEO said the company had performed poorly in 2015 due to \\"Chinese exports depressing prices.\\" Early in 2016, the company announced it had raised $3 billion in new investment capital to help reduce debt to $11.7 billion of debt. In early 2016 the company also announced a program to boost core profit by $3 billion by 2020 \\"through a mixture of cost-cutting, increased production and a focus on higher-value forms of steel.\\" Chairman Lakshmi Mittal announced doubled earnings the following year in May 2017. Along with the increase in capital, the company also sold its 35% stake in Gestamp Automacion for $979 million, with the goal of reducing ArcelorMittal's debt to less than $12 billion. By February 2016, the company made about 6% of the world's steel. It ranked 108th in the 2016 Fortune Global 500 ranking of the world's biggest corporations. =2017: Market changes= In February 2017 ArcelorMittal announced its first annual profits in five years. In February 2017, ArcelorMittal and Votorantim announced plans to combine their long steel operations in Brazil. Under the deal, Votorantim Siderurgia became a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal Brasil. In late May 2017, ArcelorMittal and the Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) agreed on preliminary terms to form a $913 million joint venture to export a fifth of the auto-grade steel made by the venture. In March 2017, the company proposed a new US$6.5 billion steel project in Karnataka, after entering into a pact with the Karnataka government in February 2017. In April 2017, Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty House Group announced it had agreed to acquire ArcelorMittal's Georgetown Steelworks in South Carolina. It is ranked 123 in the 2017 Fortune Global 500 ranking of the world's biggest corporations. By March 2017, ArcelorMittal was leading a consortium bidding for Ilva. An Italian company, Ilva owns the Taranto steelworks in southern Italy, which has Europe's largest steel output. The steelworks had been accused of toxic emissions linked to local cancer rates, and had been nationalized by the government years prior. The buyers were the AM Investco consortium, which beyond ArcelorMittal included Marcegaglia and Banca Intesa Sanpaolo. In May 2017, ArcelorMittal was announced as the preferred bidder over a different consortium led by JSW Steel, after it was able to pledge a production increase and guarantee employment levels. The final decision was waiting on Italy's ministry of economic development. On 5 June 2017, ArcelorMittal won approval to purchase Ilva for ‚Ç¨1.8 billion. In its bid, AM Investco had pledged to make investments into Ilva of ‚Ç¨2.4bn until 2023. On 1 November 2018, ArcelorMittal assumed ownership of Ilva steel operations and ArcelorMittal Italia was formed. In July 2017 the company reported a 19.3 per cent year-on-year rise in its earnings for the year's second quarter. Also, that month European Court of Justice ruled against ArcelorMittal in its lawsuit against how the EU allocates free carbon permits. The amount was lower than predicted by analysts, with the company citing the volatility in market prices. = 2018: Black snow controversy = In January 2018, black snow fell in the city of Temirtau, Kazakhstan where an ArcelorMittal plant is located. Local citizens complained that the pollution was caused by an ArcelorMittal plant. A spokesperson for ArcelorMittal explained that the discoloration of the snow was caused by a lack of wind which would otherwise blow the pollution away. = 2019: Notice to terminate to Ilva = On 4 November 2019, Arcelor Mittal (Am Investco Italy) sent to Ilva's Commissioners a notice to terminate, the Ilva lease agreement, citing as reasons that the Italian Parliament had removed the legal protection necessary for the company to implement its environmental plan without the risk of criminal liability and that a recent decision by the criminal court of Taranto would effectively force Mittal to close blast furnace #2 by 13 December 2019. A legal and media battle with the Italian state started immediately, as Ilva is not only the single primary steel mill Mittal operates in Italy but also the largest employer in Taranto. = 2020: Purchase by Cleveland-Cliffs = On September 28, 2020, the company sold its US-Business to Cleveland-Cliffs for approximately $1.4 billion.{Cite newsurl=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200927005083/en/Cleveland- Cliffs-Inc.-to-Acquire-ArcelorMittal-USAtitle=Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. to Acquire ArcelorMittal USA date=2020-09-28access-date=2020-09-28}} Products and activities Steel being rolled at an ArcelorMittal facility in Brazil. The company is involved in research and development, mining, and steel. ArcelorMittal in 2016 produced around 90 million tons of steel. As of May 2017, the company made 200 unique steel grades for automotive purposes, half of which were introduced since 2007. Among the steel varieties are Usibor 2000, which the company announced in June 2016 and released later that year. Upon release, the high-strength automotive steel was said to be about one- third stronger than other steels then available for carmaking.  Company structure  Lakshmi Mittal (owner of Mittal Steel) is the chairman and CEO. His family owns 40% of the shares and voting shares in the company. After a $3 billion rights issue earlier in April 2016, the company by 21 April 2016 had a share value of 16,616 million euros, distributed in 3,065,710,869 shares. =Predecessor companies= Acquired by Mittal Steel Company: *International Steel Group (acquired 2004) **Bethlehem Steel - United States (acquired 2003) **ISG Weirton Steel - United States (acquired 2002) **LTV-Steel Cleveland, OH - United States (acquired 2002) ***Republic Steel - United States (acquired 1984)History of Republic Steel ***Jones and Laughlin Steel - United States (acquired 1984) **Acme Steel - Chicago, US (acquired 2002) *Ispat International (acquired 2004) *ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih - Ukraine (acquired 2005) Acquired by Arcelor: *Aceralia - Spain (merger 2001) *Usinor - France (merger 2001) **Acesita - Brazil (acquired 1998) *ARBED - Luxembourg (merger 2001) *Acindar - Argentina (acquired 2006) *Dofasco - Canada (acquired 2006) =Board of directors= Comprised as follows by nine people as of June 2017: *Lakshmi Mittal, CEO and Founder of ArcelorMittal (Chairman of the Board) *Bruno Lafont, Co-chairman and former CEO of LafargeHolcim *Tye Burt, former CEO and President of Kinross Gold *Jeannot Kreck√©, Member of Parliament for Luxembourg and former Minister for the Economy and Foreign Trade of Luxembourg *Suzanne Nimocks, former Director for Energy at McKinsey & Company *Karel De Gucht, former European Commissioner for Trade and Belgian Foreign Minister *Michel Wurth, former CFO of ARBED *Karyn Ovelmen, CFO of Flowserve = Employees = As of 2012, the company had thousands of workers at 12 major facilities in the United States, in states such as Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Instruments manufactured with the \\"Mapex\\" name include drum kits and hardware.  Products  Mapex produces seven different lines of drums: the introductory \\"Voyager\\" and \\"Horizon\\" series, the intermediate \\"Meridian Birch\\" and \\"Meridian Maple\\", and the professional level \\"Saturn\\" and \\"Orion\\". In years past the V and Pro M series were called the Venus and Mars series, in keeping with the tradition of naming the kits after planets. However, the quality of these series have changed since they dropped the old names. For a short time Mapex also offered the \\"Deep Forest\\" line of drums, built entirely out of Walnut or Cherry plies, as well as the Aquiles Priester signature drum kit.Aquiles Priester - Hangar, Freakeys on Mapex website (archive) 2 January 2010 Mapex has been also associated with \\"Falcon\\" pedals, \\"Black Panther\\" snare drums and kits, and \\"Tornado\\" starter kits.  Drum kits  = Voyager and Horizon = In January 2010, the Q and QR series were no longer made, having been replaced by the new Voyager series, while the Horizon series replaced the VX series (VXB for Britain). These entry-level, yet highly regarded kits have improved their lugs, mounts, badges and bass drum claws. The \\"Horizon HZ\\" kit offers a newly mixed birch/basswood drum shell. A newly available Mapex cymbal pack is optional with any of these kits.Visited 31 January 2010. Visited 31 January 2010. = Mapex M and Meridian Birch= As of early 2009, Mapex has replaced the very popular M Birch and Pro-M drums series, with the Meridian Birch and Meridian Maple series respectively. These are considered to be intermediate/semi-pro lines of drums. The Meridian Maple series feature 7-ply, 5.8mm, all maple shells (7.2mm bass drum). They also feature Mapex 2.3mm Steel Powerhoops and Remo UT Pinstripe batter heads along with Spring Loaded Floor Tom Legs (from the higher end Saturn & Orion lines). The Meridian Birch features 6-ply, 7.2mm, all birch shells, and also feature Remo UT heads, but not the 2.3mm Powerhoops nor the Spring Cushioned Floor Tom Legs. The hoops on the Birch line (1.6mm) and the floor tom legs are considerably thinner. It is a common misconception among customers (even among some Mapex retailers) that these two lines of drums are similar and share the same features. The Maple line has several higher end features taken from the previous Pro-M line and the Birch line carries forward the M-Birch features. In 2004 the M series and Pro M series Mapex drums were both constructed with maple shells. In 2005 the M series Mapex drum changed to Birch shells, the Pro M continued to carry foreword the North American maple shells, both these shell distinctions remained through 2008. In 2009 the two lines were renamed Meridian Maple and Meridian birch to clear up the long held confusion that M indicated Maple, as the initial M series was made with Maple shells. The Meridian series are Mapex's most popular series of drums. = MyDentity = Following the popularity of the Meridian line, Mapex launched ‚Äìonly for the USA market as of 2013‚Äì the \\"MyDentity\\" line of custom ordered intermediate/semi-pro drums. This level of customization is usually only found in high-end drum lines. =Saturn= The Saturn line is constructed of maple and walnut (the oldest lines were made of basswood or mahogany instead of walnut). The kit is constructed of 6 plies of wood for a shell thickness of 5.1 millimeters. It shares a number of options with both the Mars and Orion line, but is not available with birdseye maple plies. Saturn kits come in a variety of lacquer and wrap finishes (including bursts, sparkles and fades) and come with the option of black or chrome hardware. The Saturn has become very popular, as the thinner hybrid shells provide a lower/warmer/darker fundamental tone than similar all-maple shells. Although they are priced as midrange drums, they are considered a fully professional kit and used by recording artists such as Chris Adler from Lamb of God, who recently switched over to the new Black Panther line of drums. During 2011 and 2012 Mapex also offered the Saturn LE (Limited Edition) and Saturn SE (Special Edition) Birch/Walnut kits. Mapex built 100 Limited Edition kits only, and a limited number of the SE kits as well. According to the Mapex site as of March 2013, the Special Edition Saturn Birch/Walnut was an extension and addition to the distinctive Saturn sound. Mapex had taken the rich sonic characteristics of walnut and combined them with the bright and articulate punch of birch. The result is a drum shell that projects a fusion of depth and clarity. The five- piece shell pack was available in Ocean Wave Fade, Moss Green, Wine Burst, or Walnut Fade over Figured Maple and is appointed with smoky black hardware. The relative rarity of the LE and SE kits is increasing their value and they are considered by some to be the finest Saturn kits ever made. Mapex has since released the Saturn IV line in 2014 and the Saturn V line in 2015. Along with several new shell finishes, these new lines of Saturn feature a new tom mount isolation system called Soniclear The primary change from Saturn IV to Saturn V is the addition of Mapex's Soniclear Bearing Edge, introduced previously on lower lines, including MyDentity, Armory and Mars Kits. This new edge allows the drumhead to sit flatter and brings out an improved response by optimizing the relationship between head and shell. =Orion= The Orion Series is an all-maple 6.1 millimetre 7-ply setup with an outer layer of Birdseye maple as an option. It is Mapex's flagship series and is also the most versatile kit available from Mapex as each kit can only be ordered by components. No preconfigured kits are available. It is available with Chrome, Black Nickel and 24-kt. gold-plated hardware. For the duration of 2005 the Orion's inner \\"plies\\" were identical to the all-maple Pro-M's inner plies, the difference being the outer \\"finish\\" ply. The Orion received Mapex's figured birdseye maple or other such exotic wood finishes, while the Pro-M received regular North American maple finish ply. With the exception of the 15th Anniversary edition Pro-M with a production run of 300 worldwide, this set was given the figured Birdseye Maple finish of the Orion in Autumn or Jade Fade. The overall shell thicknesses for both the Orion and the early Pro-Ms of 2005 - 2006 were identical at 6.1 mm. This was the case only till early 2006 when production changed at the factory in Tianjin. All Pro-Ms received a changed ply configuration and thickness resulting in an overall shell thickness of 5.8mm, and the Orion kept its 6.1 mm shell thickness. The Orions are actually priced lower than most of their high-end market competition. The exotic burl finish is not common with other high-end drum companies at the same price point. As of early 2012 the Orion line was discontinued. At the same time a Saturn SE (Special Edition) series of Birch/Walnut was introduced. This left the Black Panther kits as the top Mapex line available. =Black Panther= Building on the foundations of the very successful Black Panther line of snares, Mapex introduced limited editions of drumkits based on those snares. As of April 2013, four models were produced: the Blaster, the Velvetone, the Retrosonic and the Black Widow. Very recently in late 2015/early 2016, a white version of the 'Black Widow' kit called the 'White Widow' was introduced, the shell color being the only differentiating factor between the two kits.  Drumheads  Mapex snare drum with Remo head Mapex kits also come with Remo drumheads. All of the drums below Saturn come with the UT series, which are made in the Remo factory in China. They were made using the same Dupont Mylar film as is used on the Remo USA Weatherking head. The difference is in the construction of the head. Whereas the US heads were made using a poured channel technique, the China heads were crimped. The aluminium hoop was folded over a steel ring that is inserted in the U-channel to hold the film in place. Starting in 2007, Saturns and Orions came with Remo Emperor heads on the toms and clear Ambassadors for the resonant heads. This was put in place to showcase the full sonic capabilities of the drums right when they are in stores.

Camp Funston was a U.S. Army training camp located on Fort Riley, southwest of Manhattan, Kansas. The camp was named for Brigadier General Frederick Funston (1865‚Äì1917). It was one of sixteen such camps established at the outbreak of World War I. History =World War I= Construction began during the summer of 1917 and eventually encompassed approximately 1,400 buildings on . During World War I, nearly 50,000 recruits trained at the camp, commanded by Major General Leonard Wood. Notable units who received training at Camp Funston include the 89th Division, which was deployed to France in the spring of 1918, the 10th Division and black soldiers assigned to the 92nd Division. Among those trained at Camp Funston was Texas State Representative George Peddy, who managed to obtain a permit to return to Austin for the impeachment proceedings against Governor James E. Ferguson. During World War I, Camp Funston also served as a detention camp for conscientious objectors (COs) many of which were Mennonite in faith. Since it was compulsory, Hutterites sent their young men to military camps, but they did not allow them to obey any military commands or wear a uniform. In March 1918, some of the first recorded American cases of what came to be the worldwide influenza pandemic, also known as \\"Spanish flu\\", were reported at Camp Funston.Barry, John M. The Great Influenza. New York: Penguin Publishing Inc. 2004. =Correctional camp= Prior to October 1992, Camp Funston was the home of the United States Army Correctional Activity whose mission was to prepare prisoners for transition to civilian life as useful citizens or, in a few select cases, for return to duty. The Correctional Brigade environment was unique in that prisoner control was maintained by military discipline, instead of walls and bars for most of the typical prisoners‚Äô stay. The Correctional Brigade doctrine was that the minimum custody/military discipline environment when coupled with correctional treatment, educational programs, military and vocational training best prepared the typical first-time prisoner for a crime-free life after prison as either a productive soldier or a useful citizen in civilian life. Moreover, this correctional system was asserted to be less expensive to establish and operate than the traditional prison. =Modern use= Camp Funston was the location where the training of all military transition teams for service in Iraq and Afghanistan takes place. Previously, transition teams had been trained at several U.S. Army installations, most notably Fort Carson, Colorado; Camp Atterbury, Indiana; Fort Hood, Texas; and Camp Shelby, Mississippi. However, in early 2006, the U.S. Army decided to consolidate all training at Fort Riley, Kansas, in order to standardize and improve training for that critical mission. The first teams began training on June 1, 2006. The 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division took over command and control of the TT mission in October 2006. The brigade is responsible for the formation and training of the TT teams. This mission shifted to Fort Polk, Louisiana later in 2009.

It details the knighthood of Alanna of Trebond as she lives in the Bazhir desert after becoming a knight. Plot introduction A newly knighted Alanna leaves the capital to travel among the Bazhir in the desert and after being attacked by bandits and her sword breaking, she gets adopted by one of the tribes, though clashing with the tribe's shaman who seeks to destroy her name with the sword that broke her own. After fighting to the death with the shaman for her honor and winning, she has to replace the shaman and cannot leave until she trains another. After training the first 2 girl shamen she rides back home and fixes her sword. Plot summary The third book sees Alanna through her journey through the Bazhir desert, where she and her manservant Coram are adopted by the Bloody Hawk tribe of the desert people Bazhir. During their stay, Alanna duels with the Bloody Hawk shaman, a crazed wizard who is convinced Alanna is evil, and kills him. According to Bazhir law she must be the tribe's shaman until she trains a new one to replace her or someone kills her and takes her place. Alanna selects three Gifted children of the tribe, Ishak, Kara, and Kourrem, and begins to train them in magic. She also inherits the former shaman's sword, with a crystal on the hilt, symbols that remind her of the dead sorcerer Duke Roger, and a terrifying amount of dark power. She keeps it because her old sword, Lightning, broke during a battle. She also teaches the traditional Bazhir to slowly lose some of their prejudice against women. During their training, Alanna sees glimpses of the shamans the girls will become, but the boy, Ishak, constantly attempts stronger, darker sorcery. In a sudden encounter, Ishak steals the crystal sword from Alanna and tries to master its power, but it consumes him and kills him. Devastated but determined, Alanna continues to train Kara and Kourrem. Prince Jonathan and Sir Myles of Olau make a visit to the Bloody Hawk tribe, where Jonathan and Alanna renew their love affair and spend a passionate night together. When Jonathan asks her to marry him, Alanna is shocked and asks for time to think it over. During their stay, Jonathan is adopted by the tribe and takes up training under the Voice of the Tribes, an old friend of Alanna's and Jonathan's. When the Voice dies, Jonathan is made the new Voice, thus acting as a sacred link between all the Bazhir tribes. This status will help unite northerners and southerners when he eventually becomes King of Tortall. Also, Myles adopts Alanna as his daughter and heir to his lands. Jonathan, tired from the Rite of the Voice, wants to go home soon and assumes that Alanna will marry him though she has asked for time to think about it, and when he begins to make arrangements for her to return to Corus with him, they argue. She refuses to marry him, and he wounds her deeply by saying he'd rather marry a woman who knows how to act like a woman. Jonathan and Myles leave, and Alanna continues her training of Kourrem and Kara, who eventually pass the required tests and are made shamans for the tribe, Kourrem being the head shaman. Their work with the Bazhir finished and with Alanna in need of distraction from her breakup with Jonathan, Alanna and Coram travel to Port Caynn to visit the thief-king George Cooper, who is putting down a Rogue rebellion there. While Coram woos George's cousin Rispah, Alanna begins a love affair with George, who has loved her for years, but when he wants her to return to Corus with him, she refuses to go with him. The two split, and Coram accompanies Alanna back to the desert, where the Bloody Hawk chief asks her to check on a sorceress, a friend of his, whom he has been having bad dreams about. When Alanna and Coram arrive at the sorceress' drought-stricken village, they see the starved, crazed villagers burning the sorceress, thinking the sacrifice will please the gods and provide them food. Alanna and Coram rescue her, but not in time, and the sorceress dies after leaving Alanna with a scroll to give to the Bloody Hawk chief. The chief tells them it is a map to the Dominion Jewel, a legendary stone that provides untold powers in the hands of Gifted or unGifted rulers. Alanna and Coram decide to go after it.

Plot summary The first chapter of this book finds Alanna, Faithful, and Coram on a quest for the 'Dominion Jewel', which grants immense psychokinetic power to any monarch who owns it. In the town of Berat, Alanna befriends martial-arts champion Liam Ironarm, called the 'Dragon of Shang', who joins the quest. Liam begins training her in Shang fighting style, and the two become lovers. The party thence traverse the realm of Sarain, evading a civil war between the native 'K'miri' tribes and the ruler, Warlord jin Wilima, and acquire new companions in Princess Thayet, the Warlord's only child, and her K‚Äômiri protector Buriram Tourokom. At the mountain range known as the 'Roof of the World', Alanna becomes frustrated by the blizzards blocking their progress and her magical sense that trouble is occurring back in Tortall. She casts a spell on the group to keep them asleep and then ascends to the pass, where she undergoes a grueling physical trial to acquire the Jewel from its immortal guardian, Chitral. She succeeds in winning the Jewel and returns to the group, to find that Liam‚Äîwho is afraid of magic‚Äîis angry at being bewitched by her. Their romantic relationship ends, though they continue as friends and colleagues. Upon their return to Tortall, Alanna is met by her old friend Raoul of Goldenlake, who informs her of three key events that have occurred in her absence: the Tortallan monarchs have died; Prince Jonathan has been named King but not yet been crowned; and Alanna's twin brother Thom, to prove himself the most powerful sorcerer in the realm, has resurrected Duke Roger (killed by Alanna in an earlier book). Alanna hurries to take Jonathan's side and give him the Dominion Jewel, and Jonathan names her as his King's Champion. Elsewhere in Corus, Thom is being rapidly poisoned by his own magic, by its interaction with that of Roger. On the eve of the Coronation, Tortall's Great Mother Goddess warns Alanna that the ceremony will be a \\"crossroad in time\\", decisive of the realm's future. During the coronation, Roger‚Äôs plan comes to fruition: he causes a series of magical earthquakes using his and Thom‚Äôs joined power to bring down the palace, while insurgents loyal to Roger and his allies Lady Delia of Eldorne, Alex of Tirragen (Alanna‚Äôs childhood friend), and Claw, aka Ralon of Malven (Alanna‚Äôs former bully) storm the palace. Jonathan uses his Gift and unleashes the Dominion Jewel‚Äôs power to keep the earthquakes at bay, while Alanna‚Äòs friends battle to protect Jonathan from assassination and Alanna goes in search of Roger. In the prolonged battle, Thom dies, drained of his life by Roger's magic. Alanna duels Alex and defeats him. She then kills Josianne, after the princess has killed Si Cham and Faithful. Roger awaits her in the catacombs, presiding over a Gate of Idramm. He reveals how he survived his death due to Sorcerer's Sleep, as well as his hand in Lightning's origins. Weary and temporarily Giftless, Alanna remains ready for battle. Roger summons Lightning toward him, and after resisting, she realizes the benefit of having the sword fly toward him. In less than the blink of an eye, Roger is impaled by the force of the sword's movement. Alanna emerges from the battle to find in the aftermath that Jonathan and her friends survived, the insurgents are defeated and captured, but Liam Ironarm was killed defending Jonathan. Later, Alanna returns to the Bazhir (a Bedouin-like ethnicity of Tortall's southern desert) to recover from her losses. She learns that Jonathan has married Thayet‚Äîa match Alanna had given her blessing to‚Äîand appointed George a baron to guard Tortall's coast. George arrives in the desert to seek out Alanna, who professes her mutual love for him.

Directed by Joseph Pevney, the film's cast included James Cagney, Dorothy Malone, Jane Greer and Jim Backus. Chaney's grown son was played by Roger Smith, later the star of television's 77 Sunset Strip, and studio chief Irving Thalberg was portrayed by Robert Evans, who soon left acting and eventually became head of Paramount Pictures. The film's four writers were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay at the 30th Academy Awards. Plot In the early 1900s, actor Lon Chaney (James Cagney) is working in vaudeville with his wife Cleva (Dorothy Malone). Chaney quits the show and Cleva announces that she is pregnant. Lon is happy and tells Cleva that he has been hired by the famous comedy team Kolb and Dill for an upcoming show. Cleva pressures Lon to visit his parents (whom she has never met) in his hometown of Colorado Springs. Lon is reluctant because his parents are both deaf mutes, a fact Lon has never shared. Cleva reacts with disgust and does not want to give birth, fearing that the child will also be a deaf mute and she doesn't want to be the mother of a \\"dumb thing.\\" Months later, the baby Creighton is born and it soon becomes clear that the child is not deaf. Despite this good news, Lon's and Cleva's marriage continues to erode over the next few years. Soon she takes a job as a singer in a nightclub, dropping young Creighton off to his father backstage at his theater before being driven to work. Lon has developed a close but platonic friendship with chorus girl Hazel Hastings (Jane Greer). Hazel is happy to help look after young Creighton. After the child gets sick at the theater, Lon complains to Cleva's employer, who reluctantly agrees to terminate her. When confronting his wife in her dressing room, Lon discovers that Cleva has been dating Bill, a wealthy patron. Cleva learns she has been fired at her husband's connivance and reacts by screaming, which causes Bill to enter the dressing room. Bill comforts her and then asks Lon who he is. Lon responds by telling Bill that he is from the collection agency, and that he is here to collect his wife. Bill looks at Cleva with contempt and walks away. Lon returns to the theater, where he discovers Hazel being accosted in the corridor by a tall, thin man. Lon punches the man in the face and tells him to get up. Hazel explains that he can't and the man lifts up his trousers to the knee, revealing two wooden legs. He is Carl Hastings, her former husband, once rational, but now consumed with bitterness as the result of his accident. Cleva enters the dressing room to find Lon with his hands on Hazel's shoulders. Cleva screams that she will not go back to being a \\"nurse maid\\" so that he can play around with a chorus girl. Cleva leaves home and vanishes. Days later, Lon is performing a dance routine in clown makeup at a matinee when a totally deranged Cleva walks on stage and swallows a bottle of acid in front of an audience, permanently damaging her vocal cords. Cleva is hospitalized, but runs away once more. The scandal essentially destroys Lon's career in vaudeville. The state takes custody of young Creighton as they deem his home situation to be unsuitable, causing Lon to react angrily. On the advice of press agent Clarence Locan (Jim Backus), Lon moves to Hollywood to try his luck in the new field of motion pictures. After starting as an extra, Lon's tireless work ethic, and his expertise at makeup, make him an in-demand bit player and later a feature player. Lon is cast in the silent film The Miracle Man (1919) as a man thought to be physically challenged who is seemingly cured by a faith healer. His success starts him on the road to stardom in such films as The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) and The Phantom of the Opera (1925). As his career soars, Lon faces personal challenges. Although he marries Hazel and regains custody of Creighton, ex-wife Cleva reappears, seeking to spend time with Creighton (who has been told by Lon that she is dead). Hazel reveals the truth to Creighton, who leaves to stay with his mother, angry with Lon about the deception. Lon becomes ill on the set of the sound version of The Unholy Three (1930) and is diagnosed with bronchial cancer. Hazel and Locan decide to (initially) hide the truth of his condition from him. Creighton (Roger Smith) reconciles with his father and they take a fishing trip at Lon's mountain cabin. After returning from his fishing trip, Lon collapses and is returned home to live out his final days. On his deathbed, the dying Chaney (now unable to speak due to the cancer) reverts to the sign language of his childhood to express his love for his friends and family and to ask for forgiveness for unspecified transgressions. Lon signals Creighton to bring him his makeup box. He removes a stick of greasepaint and adds a \\"Jr.\\" to his own name on the box, signaling to his son his desire for him to carry on his life's work. Creighton leaves with box in hand, ready to start his film career as Lon Chaney Jr. Cast * James Cagney as Lon Chaney * Dorothy Malone as Cleva * Jane Greer as Hazel * Marjorie Rambeau as Gert * Jim Backus as Clarence * Robert Evans as Irving Thalberg * Celia Lovsky as Mrs. Chaney * Jeanne Cagney as Carrie Chaney * Roger Smith as Creighton Chaney * Robert Lyden as Creighton Chaney at 13 * Rickie Sorensen as Creighton Chaney at 8 * Dennis Rush as Creighton Chaney at 4 * Simon Scott as Carl Hastings * Jack Albertson as Dr. J.

At the time of his father's death, Creighton Chaney had been married for two years, attended business college, and worked at an LA water heater company.Classic monsters. \\"http://www.classic-monsters.com/lon- chaney-jr/\\" Lon Chaney Jr When the company failed and financial problems became overwhelming for Creighton, he started to accept film work and was billed under his birth name. It was only in the mid-1930s that he allowed himself (at the insistence of film producers) to be billed as \\"Lon Chaney, Jr.\\", an action he often said he felt ashamed of. In later life, Chaney Jr. stated that he was proud of the name \\"Lon Chaney\\", but not of the name \\"Lon Chaney Jr.\\" In the film, Lon is depicted as being at home, and surrounded by family and friends when he passes on. In reality, Chaney died in his hospital room after suffering a hemorrhage. The depiction of Chaney's makeup for The Phantom of the Opera and The Hunchback of Notre Dame differs significantly from Chaney's original makeup for these films. Cagney's face appears partially immobile behind an elaborate full latex mask and other makeup. Lon Chaney actually took great pride in his ability to distort his appearance using only a minimum of makeup, which still allowed for a great deal of facial expression. For instance, Chaney utilized thin wires in his nose and around his eyes, false teeth and dark paint around his eyes and nostrils, plus other methods. Bud Westmore's recreations of the original makeups are clearly partial masks which resemble the originals. Cagney's face in some scenes is fairly immobile, such as the scene where he speaks to Creighton while wearing his Hunchback of Notre Dame makeup, and when he speaks to the actress at the conclusion of the unmasking scene in The Phantom of the Opera.

Program status word / Memory or general purpose register read-out could then be accomplished by observing and noting the console lights. Software instruction step On later platforms with multiple users, this method was impractical and so single step execution had to be performed using software techniques. = Software techniques= * Instrumentation - requiring code to be added during compile or assembly to achieve statement stepping. Code can be added manually to achieve similar results in interpretive languages such as JavaScript. * instruction set simulation - requiring no code modifications for instruction or statement stepping In some software products which facilitate debugging of High level languages, it is possible to execute an entire HLL statement at a time. This frequently involves many machine instructions and execution pauses after the last instruction in the sequence, ready for the next 'instruction' step. This requires integration with the compilation output to determine the scope of each statement.

Most films and papers used for color photography today are chromogenic.  Description  Chromogenic film or paper contains one or many layers of silver halide (AgX) emulsion, along with dye couplers that, in combination with processing chemistry, form visible dyes. In processing, the silver image of each layer is first developed. In concert with the dye couplers in each layer, the process subsequently forms dyes only in those areas where silver is present. In full- color chromogenic materials, multiple layers of emulsion are sensitized to different wavelengths of light. Three layers are usually present, generally sensitive to red, green, and blue colored light. Cyan-colored dye is formed on the red-sensitive layer, magenta-colored dye is formed on the green-sensitive layer, and yellow-colored dye is formed on the blue-sensitive layer, following generally the CMY color model. Some chromogenic black-and-white negative films also exist, mainly to exploit the wide availability of C-41 processing. These films have softer grain and less contrast than traditional silver halide films. In these films, a single emulsion layer has panchromatic sensitivity. The dye image is typically slightly blue because of the choice of dye couplers. Examples of black-and-white chromogenic negative films are Ilford XP2 Super and Fujifilm Neopan 400CN, produced in partnership with Ilford. Kodak have ceased production of their Kodak BW400CN film. It is also possible to develop a standard black and white silver gelatine film or print using specially formulated chromogenic developers so that a colored dye image only remains after processing, the silver image being totally or partially bleached away during processing.The Master Photographer's Toning Book, Tim Rudman, Argentum, 2002, p146 et seq (Chromogenic Toners) Each microscopic point of chromogenic dye formation is called a dye cloud. After the formation of dyes is complete, the silver image is removed in processing by a specialty photographic fixer called bleach fix or blix. A processing variation called skip bleach, most popular in motion picture negative processing, leaves the silver image partially or completely intact, yielding a type of contrast enhancement. The most common chromogenic processes are C-41 for color (and chromogenic black-and-white) negative film, RA-4 for color negative paper (see Type C print), and E-6 for slide film. A great deal of research effort has been placed by manufacturers, most notably Fujifilm, Ilford Photo, and Kodak, into controlling the color and tonal characteristics of their chromogenic film and paper. The sensitization of the silver halide emulsions, the composition and mixture of the dye couplers, and the chemical interactions of layers upon one another during processing (called interlayer effects), are the subjects of numerous patents. Fujifilm is apparently unique in its use of a fourth (cyan- sensitive) color layer in certain of its negative films. Like the traditional silver halide process, the main hazardous waste product of chromogenic processing consists of silver compounds dissolved in the used fixer. This waste is usually processed to recover the valuable dissolved silver in metallic form, and to allow safe disposal of the remaining substance. A history of improper handling of waste fixer has led to environmental contamination. For example, the disposal of untreated waste fixer into the sanitary sewers and storm drains of New York City has led to high levels of dissolved silver in the Hudson River.

When color developer reduces ionized (exposed) silver-halide crystals, the developer is oxidized, and the oxidized molecules react with dye coupler molecules to form dye in situ. The silver image is removed by subsequent bleach and fix processes, so the final image will consist of the dye image. Dye coupler technology has seen considerable advancement since the beginning of modern color photography. Major film and paper manufacturers have continually improved the stability of the image dye by improving couplers, particularly since the 1980s, so that archival properties of images are enhanced in newer color papers and films. Generally speaking, dye couplers for paper use are given more emphasis on the image permanence than those for film use, but some modern films (such as Fujichrome Provia films) use variants of couplers that were originally designed for paper use to further improve the image permanence.

The former member of the Russian Premier League now plays in the Russian Professional Football League. The club was previously known as Geolog (in 1961‚Äì1963 and 1983‚Äì1991, meaning Geologist), Priboy (in 1964‚Äì1965, meaning Surf), Neftyanik (in 1966‚Äì1977, meaning Oiler), Stroitel (meaning Builder), Fakel (in 1980‚Äì1982, meaning Torch), Dinamo-Gazovik (in 1992‚Äì1996), SDYSOR-Sibnefteprovod (in 2003). History The club was founded in 1961 and played in the Soviet Class B (1961‚Äì1970), Second League (1971‚Äì1986), and First League (1987‚Äì1991). In 1992 Tyumen entered the newly formed Russian Premier League and finished last between 20 teams. In 1993 Tyumen won the eastern zone of the First Division and returned to the Premier League for another two seasons, achieving their best result in history in 1994 (12th position). After relegation in 1995 Tyumen once again won the First Division in 1996. In 1998 and 1999 Tyumen suffered two consecutive relegations, ending up in the Second Division. In 2000‚Äì2002, Tyumen played in the Second Division, finishing no lower than fourth. In 2003 the club refused to participate in the Second Division, instead fielding a youth team in the Amateur League. In 2004 the club fielded a senior team as well, winning the zonal tournament of the Amateur League, but declined promotion. After finishing first again in 2005, Tyumen returned to professional football and began to play in the Second Division. It won its zone of the Russian Professional Football League in 2013‚Äì14 season and was promoted to the second-level Russian National Football League. Despite finishing in the relegation zone at the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season, the club was not relegated as other clubs ahead in the standings failed to obtain the league license for 2018‚Äì19. On 20 March 2019, 6 points in the standings were taken from Tyumen for unpaid debts to former players Marat Shaymordanov, Sergei Shumeyko and Nikita Fursin. As a result, the club dropped from 18th place to 19th (both in relegation zone). The club was relegated to PFL at the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season.

Spanish and American periods A 1901 execution at the Old Bilibid Prison, Manila, Philippines During Spanish colonial rule, the most common methods of execution were death by firing squad (especially for treason/military crimes, usually reserved for independence fighters) and garrotte. A notable case of execution through garrote by the repressive Spanish government in the Philippines is the execution of three Filipino Catholic martyr priests, Mariano G√≥mez, Jos√© Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora, also known as Gomburza. Death by hanging was another popular method. Another prominent example is the national hero, Jos√© Rizal, who was executed by firing squad on the morning of December 30, 1896, in the park that now bears his name. In 1902, the Philippine Commission abolished the use of garrote as a means of executing criminals, and substituted in place thereof execution by hanging. In 1926, the electric chair (Spanish: silla el√©ctrica; Filipino: silya el√©ktrika) was introduced by the United States' colonial Insular Government, making the Philippines the only other country to employ this method. The last colonial- era execution took place under Governor-General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. in February 1932. There were no executions under Manuel L. Quezon, the first President of the Commonwealth. 1946‚Äì1986 The capital crimes after regaining full sovereignty in July 1946 were murder, rape and treason. However, no executions took place until April 1950, when Julio Gullien was executed for attempting to assassinate President Manuel Roxas. Other notable cases includes Marci√°l \\"Baby\\" Ama, electrocuted at the age of 16 on October 4, 1961, for murders committed while in prison for lesser charges. Ama notably became the subject of the popular 1976 film, Bitayin si... Baby Ama! (Execute Baby Ama!). Former Governor of Negros Occidental, Rafael Lacson, and 22 of his allies, were condemned to die in August 1954 for the murder of a political opponent. Ultimately, Lacson was never executed. In total, 51 people were electrocuted up to 1961. Execution numbers climbed under President Ferdinand Marcos, who himself was sentenced to death in 1939 for the murder of Julio Nalundasan‚Äîthe political rival of his father, Mariano; the young Ferdinand was acquitted on appeal. A notorious triple execution took place in May 1972, when Jaime Jos√©, Basilio Pineda, and Edgardo Aquino were electrocuted for the 1967 abduction and gang-rape of young actress Maggie dela Riva. The state ordered that the executions be broadcast on national television. Under the Marcos regime, drug trafficking also became punishable by death by firing squad, such as the case with Lim Seng, whose execution on January 15, 1973, was also ordered broadcast on national television. Future President and then-Chief of the Philippine Constabulary General Fidel V. Ramos was present at the execution. The electric chair was used until 1976, when execution by firing squad eventually replaced it as the sole method of execution. Under Marcos' 20-year authoritarian rule, however, countless more people were summarily executed, tortured or simply disappeared for opposition to his rule. After Marcos was deposed in 1986, the newly drafted 1987 Constitution prohibited the death penalty but allowed the Congress to reinstate it \\"hereafter\\" for \\"heinous crimes\\"; making the Philippines the first Asian country to abolish capital punishment. When the Philippines had the death penalty, male inmates condemned to death were held at New Bilibid Prison and female inmates condemned to death were held at Correctional Institution for Women (Mandaluyong). The death chamber for inmates to be electrocuted was in Building 14, within the Maximum Security Compound of New Bilibid. The Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) Museum previously served as the lethal injection chamber. Reinstatement and moratorium New Bilibid Prison held male death row inmates President Fidel V. Ramos promised during his campaign that he would support the re-introduction of the death penalty in response to increasing crime rates. The new law (Republic Act 7659), drafted by Ramos, was passed in 1993, restoring capital punishment. This law provided the use of the electric chair until the gas chamber (chosen by the government to replace electrocution) could be used. In 1996, Republic Act 8177 was passed, prescribing the use of lethal injection as the method of carrying out capital punishment. Executions resumed in 1999, starting with Leo Echegaray, who was put to death by lethal injection under Ramos' successor, Joseph Estrada, marking the first execution after the reinstatement of the death penalty. The next execution saw an embarrassing mishap when President Estrada decided to grant a last-minute reprieve, but failed to get through to the prison authorities in time to stop the execution. Following on a personal appeal by his spiritual advisor, Bishop Teodoro Bacani, Estrada called for a moratorium in 2000 to honor the bimillenial anniversary of Christ's birth. Executions were resumed a year later. Estrada's successor, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, was a vocal opponent of the death penalty and also approved a moratorium on the carrying out of capital punishment. This prohibition was later formalized into a full law when the Congress passed Republic Act 9346 in 2006. The next year, the Philippines became a party to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights regarding the abolition of the death penalty. President Arroyo controversially pardoned many prisoners during her presidency, including a 2009 pardon for all remaining felons convicted for the 1983 assassination of former Senator and opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr. An old embarkation card (erroneously) warning visitors of the death penalty for drug trafficking. The caveat has since been removed from subsequent versions. On April 15, 2006, the sentences of 1,230 death row inmates were commuted to life imprisonment, in what Amnesty International believes to be the \\"largest ever commutation of death sentences\\".Amnesty International Philippinesl, April 19, 2006 Philippines: Largest ever commutation of death sentences Capital punishment was again suspended via Republic Act No. 9346, which was signed by President Arroyo on June 24, 2006.

Arroyo kills death law Critics of Arroyo's initiative called it a political move meant to placate the Roman Catholic Church, some sectors of which were increasingly vocal in their opposition to her rule. =Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights= The Philippines subsequently signed the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Optional Protocol commits its members to the abolition of the death penalty within their borders. It was signed on September 20, 2006 and ratified on November 20, 2007.Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On December 6, 2016, after the Justice Committee of the Philippine House of Representatives approved a draft measure on the reimposition of the death sentence, Zeid Ra‚Äôad Al Hussein, the UN Commissioner for Human Rights released an open letter addressed to the Philippine Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate saying, \\"International law does not permit a State that has ratified or acceded to the Second Optional Protocol to denounce it or withdraw from it.\\" Zaid asserted that there is no \\"denunciation clause\\" in the protocol, \\"thereby guaranteeing the permanent non-reintroduction of the death penalty by States that ratified the Protocol.\\" Support for reintroduction of capital punishment During the 2016 election campaign, presidential candidate and frontrunner Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte campaigned to restore the death penalty in the Philippines. During the \\"Yes or No\\" segment of the second presidential debate on March 20, 2016, Duterte and Senator Grace Poe were the only candidates who said \\"Yes\\" when asked about the restoration of the death penalty in the country, favoring the decision. Duterte, who won the election in May 2016, supports restoration of the death penalty by hanging. It has been reported that he wants capital punishment for criminals involved in illegal drugs, gun-for-hire syndicates and those who commit \\"heinous crimes\\" such as rape, robbery or car theft where the victim is murdered, while Poe has stated that the capital punishment should apply to criminals convicted of \\"drugs and multiple crimes where involved people can no longer be rehabilitated.\\" Duterte has theatrically vowed \\"to litter Manila Bay with the bodies of criminals.\\" In December 2016, the bill to resume capital punishment for certain \\"heinous offenses\\" swiftly passed in the committee level in the House of Representatives; it passed the full House of Representatives in February 2017. However, the law reinstating the death penalty stalled in the Senate in April 2017, where it did not appear to have enough votes to pass.Collapse of death penalty bill in the Senate hailed In a 2017 poll, 67% of Filipinos supported the death penalty. In July 2019, bills seeking to reinstate capital punishment in the Philippines were revived in the Senate ahead of the opening of the 18th Congress. Methods The Philippines was the only country aside from the United States that used the electric chair, due to its being introduced during the U.S. colonial period. Until its first abolition in 1987, the country reverted to using death by firing squad. After re-introduction of the death penalty in 1993, the country switched to lethal injection as its sole method of execution.

The movie How to Deal was based on this novel as well as one of Dessen's other novels, That Summer. Plot summary The book is split into three parts. =Part I: The Grand Canyon= Halley and Scarlett Thomas live in directly opposite houses and both had jobs at Milton's Market. At the beginning of the summer, Scarlett starts dating Michael Sherwood but they decide to keep it quiet, with only Halley really knowing, because Michael recently broke up with cheerleader Elizabeth Gunderson and he claims he didn't want her to get upset. For the last two weeks of summer vacation, Halley is sent away to Sisterhood Camp against her will by her mother, who is having difficulties coming to terms with Halley growing up and changing. Then disaster strikes and Halley gets a phone call from Scarlett telling her about Michael's death. Scarlett asks Halley to come home and be with her. Her mom, even though she is unhappy about this, brings her home. On the day of the funeral, it is clear that no one knew about Scarlett and Michael, and Elizabeth Gunderson seems to be taking it very hard. On the ride home, it is raining heavily and as they are driving along they see Macon Faulkner, Michael's best friend, walking and they offer him a lift which he declines as he is clearly upset. Going back to school on the first day, Scarlett states she feels ill. Halley goes to class and finds her new schedule is wrong so she goes to the guidance counselor's office to sort it out. There she gets talking to Macon who jokes around with her and teaches her the \\"Jedi Mind Trick\\" (using one's mind to move things). Halley is a bit surprised by his sudden friendliness. Later that day, she finds out they have P.E. together. She develops a crush on him as he fascinates her with his unpredictable and wild lifestyle. Macon mentions a party, casually asking her out and she says \\"yes\\". She and Scarlett later go to the party, where Macon doesn't show up. When the party host, Ginny Tabor, throws everyone out, they go back to sit on Scarlett's porch and Halley talks about how she doesn't deserve him. He later turns up at her window and tells her he did go to the party but he was in the attic so it was all a misunderstanding. He kisses her. Halley's nerdy ex-boyfriend, Noah Vaughn, is watching from the kitchen window. While she is doing her chore of mowing the lawn, Macon turns up with a giant mower to help which pleases her father but makes her mother angry as it is supposed to be her job to mow the lawn. Her mother becomes very nosy and keeps bugging Halley about who he is. =Part II: Someone Like You= Halley and Scarlett are working when Scarlett pulls Halley into the bathroom and tells her that she is pregnant. They tell Scarlett's mother, who books an abortion appointment. On the day of the abortion, Scarlett decides against it and calls Halley to pick her up from the clinic. Halley asks Macon to drive her there and he does. When they have picked up Scarlett, Halley's mother sees them and assumes they are just cutting class. She tells Scarlett's mother, who then enlists Halley's mother's help to sort a compromise. Halley is then grounded. Halley has a birthday dinner the next day with her family, the Vaughn family, and Scarlett. Later, she sneaks out with Macon. He takes her to the quarry where they passionately make out, leaving Halley feeling as though the girl she used to be has left her and she has been replaced by someone new. The next chapters are focused on the changes that happen throughout Scarlett's pregnancy and the pressures of Halley's relationship with Macon, who is constantly asking her to have sex with him. Although she thinks about it a lot she isn't ready and they start to become distant, which isn't helped by his secretive lifestyle. Elizabeth Gunderson drops hints about him cheating on her. Her mother is forever asking her about Macon and she dislikes him despite never having met him. Halley is forbidden from seeing Macon. Everyone at school finds out about the pregnancy because Ginny, who can't keep secrets, overhears them talking in the bathroom. When Halley decides to have sex with Macon at a New Year's Eve party, Scarlett tries to convince her not to, and they get into a major argument that leaves them not speaking. Halley gets drunk before she can do it. When she throws up and leaves, Macon is furious because he thinks she has been just leading him on. While he is driving her home, he is too busy shouting at her to watch the road and they get into a major car accident. Before going into the emergency room, Macon holds Halley's hand tightly and says, \\"I love you.\\" Halley is seriously injured. Macon doesn't visit. Her mother is disappointed in her because she does not know the truth about what really happened. =Part III: Grace= After Halley gets out of the hospital, Macon comes to see her at her window. Halley having had enough breaks up with him which breaks his heart because he then realizes he's in love with her. Her mother comes down and starts to shout at her for seeing Macon. Halley explains what has just happened. She also tells her mother how she feels about all the restrictions she has put on her and they come to an understanding: both of them will try harder to get on. Next is prom with Elizabeth now dating Macon. Halley goes to prom with the family-friend and former boyfriend Noah. Noah gets drunk and rips Halley's prom dress. She gets angry and is forced into the bathroom where she bumps into Elizabeth. Elizabeth tells her that Macon still loves her but they are interrupted by the announcement that Scarlett is in labor. Halley, Scarlett, Scarlett's other friend, Cameron try to leave but the only transport to the hospital is Macon's car. Macon and his now girlfriend Elizabeth (who appear to be in a fight) take them to the hospital. Halley calls her mother, who comes down and helps her through the labor. After the birth, Scarlett names the baby Grace Halley Thomas and everyone turns up in the waiting room. The school prom-goers and all Scarlett's mother's friends all come together in happiness for the birth. After everything has calmed down and everyone has gone home, Halley starts to walk home alone, but she is happy, thinking about Grace Halley's life ahead and what she could offer her in life.

Pilivƒì·π£a is performed during Navratri to honour the Goddess Durga whose favoured animal is the tiger. Mangalore Dasara is one of the festivals during which large number of enthusiasts participate in this ritual. It was originated in Udupi District of Karnataka and initially performed during the Krishna Janmashtami/Mosarukudike and Ganesha Chaturthi at Mangalore, Udupi, Moodabidri, Kundapur and many other places in Tulu Nadu. Typically, young males form troops of five to ten members or more, which will have three to five males painted and costumed to look like tigers, and a band called thaase in Tulu with two or three drummers. This troop is accompanied by the manager of the group. During Navratri, these troops will be roaming the streets of their towns, with the accompanying drum beats of their bands. They stop at homes and businesses or on the roadsides to perform for about ten minutes after which they collect some money from the people who have observed their performance. The troops perform until the last day of Navratri, and almost all of them form part of the Sharada processions organized by various temples such as Mangaladevi, Gokarnanatheshwara and Venkatramana temple. After the procession is over, performances are stopped and the paint is removed.  Costumes  A Pilivesha Mask While Pili means \\"tiger\\" in Tulu, dancers also painted themselves with leopard or cheetah motifs. The costumes may vary depending on the place, costumes used in Mangalore is different compared to Udupi district. Each person will be wearing just a knicker/shorts, which usually has a tiger-skin motif. The rest of his bare body and face is painted with various designs that denote tigers, cheetahs, and leopards. A headgear or mask made of fake fur and sometimes a tail is worn to complete the ensemble. The paint causes a burning sensation on the skin. But this is endured by the persons to be part of the celebrations and also to earn some extra money in the holiday season. Originally people used to do this as a part of a religious vow. The paint is kept on the body for a couple of days and repainted or retouched as desired.  Skills  Pilivesha Dancers The skills may vary from person to person and the basic skill required is to know the tiger dance steps which requires one to have enough stamina. Usual skills performed by the artists are Fire breathing, Hand walking, Handstands, gymnastic moves, picking money from mouth by bending backwards and lifting akkimudi (rice tied in straw, weighing 42 kg) in teeth and throwing it backwards etc.  In Popular Culture  The 2014 Kannada movie Ulidavaru Kandanthe featured Tiger dance where one of the character(actor Achyuth Kumar) belongs to the Pilivesha troop. Also, there is a song titled \\"Pilivesha Beats\\" completely dedicated to tiger dance.

He was a son of painter Robert Walter Weir, long-time professor of drawing at the Military Academy at West Point. His younger brother, J. Alden Weir, also became a well-known artist who painted in the style of American Impressionism. Biography He was born August 28, 1841, at West Point, New York, and studied with his father Robert Walter Weir and at the National Academy, New York. As a young man, he worked on still life paintings and became proficient at landscapes. In 1862, around the time of his 21st birthday, he was commissioned by the art patron Robert Leighton Stuart to paint a landscape scene of West Point which he named Hudson Highlands, West Point, Summer Afternoon. It is also known as View of the Hudson Highlands, West Point. This commission introduced him to the art world of New York City, and led to his renting a small room in the Tenth Street Studio, where he became acquainted with many of the rising young artists of the day. His next major work was An Artist's Studio, depicting his father painting in his studio. It was finished in 1864 and then exhibited at the Athenaeum Club and the National Academy of Design. The work became his first major sale, and led to his election as an associate of the National Academy. Weir became fascinated with the West Point Iron and Cannon Factory, across the Hudson from West Point, a factory that manufactured most of the large guns for the Union during the Civil War. His third major work was The Gun Foundry, 1866, an unusual interior factory scene that depicts the casting of a Parrott Gun. This work was well received at the 1866 spring exhibition of the National Academy of Design and led to his election as a full academician. His fourth major painting was Forging the Shaft, 1868. It was also painted at the West Point Foundry, but after the end of the Civil War, and showed the creation of a great shaft for the propeller of an ocean liner. Exhibited at the Academy in 1868, it was also very well received. It was destroyed by fire in 1869, and Weir painted a replica between 1874 and 1877. In 1868 he studied abroad. After his return he was named first director (later dean) of the School of Fine Arts at Yale University. He served in that position from 1869 to 1913. While establishing the foundations of the Yale School of Fine Arts, John enlisted the help of his brother, Julian Alden Weir, who at the time was studying at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. John wrote Julian asking for information about how the school was run and how classes were taught. He also asked Julian to send him examples of life drawings, copies of Old Master paintings and studies of heads, done by Julian or his fellow students, that he could use in his classes at Yale. Thus, though John was working at an American university, the curriculum and organization of the school was based largely on European methods, which coincided with the multicultural nature of all three Weirs‚Äô painting careers. When Julian returned to America after living in Paris for four years, he carried on the family legacy and took a teaching position at the Women‚Äôs Art School of the Cooper Union, in New York. He, like his brother, participated in the education of women artists at a time when they had few opportunities for formal study in this country. Julian‚Äôs teaching was perhaps the most forward-looking among his family, as he embraced both old and new sources, extolling the importance of Old Master paintings, but also promoting the radical style of the Impressionists.Cotter, Sarah. \\"The Weir Family and the Flowering of American Art Education.\\" New Britain Museum of American Art.

Personal life Born in Paris, Pierre Taittinger's family were originally from Lorraine and had left the Moselle d√©partement when it had been annexed by the German Empire in 1871 in order to remain French citizens. An officer in the cavalry during the First World War, Taittinger received several citations and was decorated with the L√©gion d'honneur. In 1919 he was elected deputy of the Charente-Inf√©rieure d√©partement. Taittinger married Gabrielle Guillet (1893‚Äì1924) in 1917. In 1925 he married Anne-Marie Mailly (1887‚Äì1986). He died in Paris in 1965 and was buried in Reims at the cimeti√®re du Nord with his third son Fran√ßois (1921‚Äì1960) who had run the Taittinger champagne house between 1945 and 1960. His son Michel, a French military hero and second lieutenant in the 66th African Artillery Regiment of the French Army, died on 15 June 1940 at the age of 20 in the city of Saint Parres-aux-Tertres, near Troyes in the Champagne region. He had held off for five hours a Panzer division of General von Kleist with his fellow soldiers, many of whom were of Moroccan, Algerian and West African units. Michel had been a student in the French military academy Ecole Polytechnique. Another of Taittinger's sons, Jean Taittinger, was deputy mayor of Reims from 1959 to 1977, Secretary of State for Budget from 1971 to 1973 and State Minister of Justice from 1973 to 1974 in the administration of Georges Pompidou. Political career He was mayor of Saint-Georges-des- Coteaux, in the same d√©partement, from 1919 until 1937, and again from 1953 until his death in 1965. In 1924 he was elected deputy of the 1st arrondissement of Paris, and held this mandate until 1940. In 1924, Taittinger founded the Jeunesses patriotes (Patriotic Youths), a right-wing group, recruited mostly from university students and financed by industrialists. Taittinger took inspiration for the group's creation in the Boulangist Ligue des patriotes. Taittinger was also deeply influenced by the Bonapartist movement, during which he was a member of the French Parliament. In the end of the 1920s, the Jeunesses patriotes became one of the far-right's major anti- Communist movements, challenging the Action fran√ßaise and the Croix de Feu under Colonel de Laroque. In 1937, he was elected to the municipal council of Paris and to the departmental council of the Seine. In March 1940, he was elevated to the rank of Commander in the Order of the L√©gion d'honneur. He became president of the municipal council of Paris in May 1943, as the Germans occupied the city, and held this position until the Liberation of Paris in August 1944. On August 17, 1944, concerned that explosives were being placed at strategic points around Paris by the Germans, Taittinger met with the German military governor Dietrich von Choltitz. On being told that Choltitz intended to slow up as much as possible the Allied advance, Taittinger, along with the Swedish consul general Raoul Nordling, attempted to persuade Choltitz not to destroy Paris. As the Allies rolled into the Paris Basin, Pierre Taittinger made an incredible change from collaborator to a member of the resistance. After the war, he published a book called ...et Paris ne fut pas d√©truit (\\"...and Paris was not destroyed\\") which was awarded a prize by the French Academy. In 1954 he became honorary deputy (a title given to ex-members of the French National Assembly). Champagne business Taittinger, who, before the First World War, had run a business involved in the distribution and export of champagne with one of his brothers-in-law, acquired in 1931 the venerable champagne firm of Forest-Fourneaux, founded in 1734 by Jacques Fourneaux and the third oldest champagne house in existence. The next year he bought the Ch√¢teau de la Marquetterie and its champagne estate, near √âpernay, which he had first visited during the war while stationed in the area. In the following years, he bought hundreds of acres of vineyards in the finest producing areas of Champagne, taking advantage of the cheap price of land caused by the 1930s economic crisis. Forest-Fourneaux, renamed Ets Taittinger Mailly & Cie, was transformed by Taittinger into a world-famous champagne house, Champagne Taittinger, operating from the cellars of the Saint-Nicaise Abbey in Reims. Pierre Taittinger restored the House of the Counts of Champagne in the center of Reims, damaged by the Germans during the First World War, which had been the residence of the Counts of Champagne during the Middle Ages, now the property of Champagne Taittinger. He bequeathed his estate of La Graineti√®re, on the Isle of Rh√©, to the city of Reims, which has become a summer camp for the children of Reims.  External links  * Callil, Carmen.

His work had a great influence on the aesthetics of Russian cinematography at the beginning of the 20th century. Bauer made more than seventy films between 1913 and 1917 of which 26 survived. He already used the relatively long sequence shots and displacements that would come to be associated with camera virtuosos. Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan called Bauer \\"The greatest director you've never heard of.\\" Georges Sadoul called him \\"the first true artist in the history of cinema\\".Georges Sadoul. –í—Å–µ–æ–±—â–∞—è –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –∫–∏–Ω–æ. ‚Äî Moscow, Iskustvo, 1958. ‚Äî –¢. 3. ‚Äî page 178 Biography Bauer was born in Moscow in 1865, the son of the Bohemian immigrant musician Franz Bauer and his wife, an operatic singer. From childhood, Bauer displayed artistic tendencies and participated in his favourite dramatised scenes (his sister was a professional actress). In 1887, Bauer graduated from the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. He tried out a number of different professions, first working as a caricaturist, drawing satirical sketches for the press. He then became a master of art photography, before moving to work in the theatre, as a producer, an impresario, and a professional set designer. In the 1890s he married the actress and dancer Lina Ancharovna, whose surname he used during the First World War when he went under the pseudonym of Evgeni Ancharov, feeling that his own surname was \\"too German\\". Even in these early years, Bauer was attracted to cinematography and started to work as an artistic producer and director. His first work in the cinema was an order for set decorations for the film \\"300 Years of the House of Romanov\\" (1913), produced by Alexander Drankov's film company. After this, Bauer worked for Drankov as a producer and made four films. He then made another four films for the Moscow branch of the French company Path√© Brothers, and then finally started to work for the Khanzhonkov company, which at that time was the unspoken leader in Russian cinematography. From the end of 1913 to the start of 1917, Bauer made more than 80 films, of which less than half have survived. Bauer worked mainly in the genres of social and psychological drama (although he also made comedies), such as Daydreams, After Death (both 1915), A Life for a Life (1916), and The Revolutionary (1917). He worked with the leading actors of Russian silent cinema, including Ivan Mozzhukhin, Vera Kholodnaya, Vitold Polonsky, Ivan Perestiani, Vera Karalli and others. In 1917, Bauer and the Khanzhonkov company moved to a new studio in Yalta, where he made the film For Happiness with the young actor Lev Kuleshov. Bauer broke his leg on the set and had to work on his next film, The King of Paris, from a bathchair. However, Bauer started to suffer from complications relating to pneumonia and could not complete this film. On 22 June 1917, Bauer died in a Yalta hospital. His final film was completed by actress Olga Rakhmanova. Significance and Influence Bauer is considered a leading stylist of Russian silent cinematography and placed particular emphasis on the pictorial aspect of film- making. He is considered a master of psychological drama, and also one of the first Russian directors who developed the artistic side of cinema including montage, mise-en-scene and the composition of the frame. He made great use of his theatrical experience when making his films, the outcomes of which occasionally prefigured future achievements in cinema. Bauer was the first to start to consider the placing of lights on the film-set and changed the lighting during the filming, used unusual filming angles, made frequent use of wide spaces, and filmed through \\"gaseous\\" material to produce the effect of fog. He attributed great significance to the composition of each shot, constructing decor and natural shots with artistic expressions of classical landscapes, made use of camera movement to widen the space of the shot, and add a dramatic effect. Bauer's artistic experiments and outstanding expertise gave him a reputation as the leading director in Russian cinema.

August Philipp was Prince-Bishop of Speyer and sovereign Lord zu Gemen from 1771 till 1797.  Life  At the age of 8 years, on 6 December 1729 Damian August Philipp Karl von Limburg-Stirum pronounced his vows. One year later, on 6 December 1730, he was made Domicellar of Speyer by his uncle prince-bishop Damian Hugo Philipp von Sch√∂nborn. He started his theology studies in Rome in 1742, then continued in W√ºrzburg. On 3 November 1753 he was named Subdeacon of the cathedral of Speyer, and two years later as Deacon. He succeeded Franz Christoph von Huttens as bishop on 25 May 1770. During his time as bishop, Damian August Philipp Karl von Limburg Stirum added new defensive walls to Bruchsal, as modern cannons made the existing defenses obsolete. The remains from these city walls can still be seen today. He also established a hospital, a school of Latin, and shelters for the poor. On 1 October 1792, he was forced to flee from the French revolutionary army. He went to Veitsh√∂chheim, Augsburg, and Freising and came back to Bruchsal on 20 April 1793. Three years later, on 21 September 1795, was he again overthrown by the French army. He settled in Freising and later in Passau. Prince-bishop Damian August Philipp Karl von Limburg-Stirum died in Passau on 22 February 1797 in Freudenhain castle. He was buried in the Cappucine chapel of Freudenhain. The church and the tomb were later destroyed during the revolution. His heart was however brought to Bruchsal on 21 March 1797 and placed in a silver urn in the tomb of the Prince Bishops in St. Peter's church. His successor, the last prince- bishop of Speyer, was Wilderich of Walderdorf until the German Mediatisation in 1806. According to some genealogists, he is the ancestor of king Willem- Alexander of the Netherlands, through an illegitimate daughter he is believed to have had in 1761.Die Ahnen Claus Georg von Amsberg, Limburg a.d.Lahn, 1966 , Euler, F.

It was aired from 21 January 1990 through to 21 February 1993 on RTL plus for three series, totaling approximately 140 episodes. It was the first erotic TV show on German television and was also available to viewers across Europe as it was broadcast without encryption via the Astra satellite which could be received over a wide area and was popular with 'early adopter' satellite enthusiasts in the UK. The show caused substantial outrage at the time, as partial nudity was a central feature (the show featured scantily dressed and stripping women). The show was innovative in broadcasting 3D effect film clips where the background was scrolled across the screen at a slower speed than dancers in the foreground, thereby giving the effect of depth on a 2D screen using the Pulfrich effect. The program The host of the show was Hugo Egon Balder, who was supported by up to three co-hosts: *Series 1: Monique Sluyter,Was macht eigentlich...Monique Sluyter in Stern vom 9.

The shooting time was around four weeks each. The set design, the format and the cast with each season changing were completely taken over by Colpo Grosso, as well as the song sung in Italian. Other Colpo Grosso adaptations were in Spain (¬°Ay, qu√© calor!) and Sweden (Tutti Frutti). In Brazil, a version that was not taped in Italy, but almost completely copied, was called Cocktail. Even today, the Italian version is broadcast on various satellite channels worldwide. Objective Two contestants could win points during guessing game rounds, which were invested into removing various clothing items of a stripper. The contestants would call 'hei√ü' or 'kalt' (hot or cold) to make their guess. If the lady was almost entirely undressed, a so- called \\"L√§nderpunkt\\" (country point) was awarded (the term \\"L√§nderpunkt\\" is still widely associated with the show even today). The number of obtained \\"L√§nderpunkten\\" then determined the winnings, which could occasionally reach up to 5000 ECU coins. The studio band played throughout the program to create a loose atmosphere. \\"Cin Cin Girls\\" A significant portion of success of Tutti Frutti is attributed to the so-called \\"ballet Cin Cin\\" (in the original Italian, \\"ragazze cin cin\\"). This was a group of internationally well-known models, who were hired permanently to fill certain roles in the show. Each was representing a certain fruit and some are still known as this fruit. Former German \\"Playmates of the Year\\" Stella Kobs (lemon in series 1) Jolie Mitnick Salter (blueberry in series 1) and Elke Jeinsen (strawberry in series 2) filled this role, among others. Reception When Tutti Frutti was first broadcast, the Federal Republic of Germany was changing. Tutti Frutti as the first erotic TV show on German television acted, so to speak, as a kind of \\"erotic wall opening\\". The program was then criticized as being Misogynistic, but the fact that Tutti Frutti dared to deal with the bare facts hardly led to a scandal. Rather, the debate in the German tabloid and quality press at the time documented the \\"normalization of publicly staged nudity.\\" The mostly devastating judgments of TV criticism aimed more at the questionable aesthetics of the program than at moral questions.Christian Pundt: Konflikte um die Selbstbeschreibung der Gesellschaft: Der Diskurs √ºber Privatheit im Fernsehen. In: Ralph Wei√ü, Jo Groebel: Privatheit im √∂ffentlichen Raum: Medienhandeln zwischen Individualisierung und Entgrenzung. VS Verlag, Wiesbaden 2002. S. 272‚Äì273. Financially, Tutti Frutti was a great success for a long time, as the advertising revenue far exceeded the minute price of the program. Tutti Frutti drew attention to itself, among other things, by filing a complaint by the responsible state media authority against RTL for the display of sponsorship advertisements (hence the display of permanent commercials or the subsequent blurring of the logos), by recorders with strips in 3D (see Pulfrich effect) in the second season and through a very extensive merchandising (sound carriers, magazines, calendars, videos). Neue Revue magazine sponsored the first season. Above all, fans appreciated the show's rather anarchic charm. \\"Tutti Frutti was what would later have been called a cult,\\" said media critic Hans Hoff.

Folklorists have proposed a variety of origins for the entity, including that they may originally stem from Slavic paganism, where they may have been seen as benevolent spirits. Rusalki appear in a variety of media in modern popular culture, particularly in Slavic language-speaking countries, where they frequently resemble the concept of the mermaid.  Etymology  The term \\"rusalka\\" () derives from \\"Rusalija\\" (, , , ) which entered Slavic languages, via Byzantine Greek \\"rous√°lia\\" (), from the Latin \\"RosƒÅlia\\" as a name for Pentecost and the days adjacent to it.Hampson, R. T., Medii Aevi Kalendarium or, Dates, charters, and customs of the Middle Ages, p. 341. Longstanding, likely pre-Christian, annual traditions resulted in that time of year being associated with spirits (navki, mavki) which were subsequently named for the holiday.–ú–∞–≤—Å—å–∫–∏–π (–Ω—è–≤—Å—å–∫–∏–π) –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–¥–µ–Ω—å // –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ –º–∞–ª–∞ –µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥—ñ—è ‚Äî –¢. 4. –ö–Ω. 7: –õ–µ-–ú–µ ‚Äî –ë—É–µ–Ω–æ—Å-–ê–π—Ä–µ—Å, 1950. ‚Äî –°. 882  Origin and appearance  Witold Pruszkowski \\"Rusa≈Çki\\" 1877 According to Vladimir Propp, the original \\"rusalka\\" was an appellation used by pagan Slavic peoples, who linked them with fertility and did not consider rusalki evil before the 19th century. They came out of the water in the spring to transfer life-giving moisture to the fields and thus helped nurture the crops. In 19th- century versions, a rusalka is an unquiet, dangerous being who is no longer alive, associated with the unclean spirit. According to Dmitry Zelenin,Zelenin, D.K, cited in young women, who either committed suicide by drowning due to an unhappy marriage (they might have been jilted by their lovers or abused and harassed by their much older husbands) or who were violently drowned against their will (especially after becoming pregnant with unwanted children), must live out their designated time on Earth as rusalki. However, the initial Slavic lore suggests that not all rusalki occurrences were linked with death from water. It is accounted by most stories that the soul of a young woman who had died in or near a river or a lake would come back to haunt that waterway. This undead rusalka is not invariably malevolent, and would be allowed to die in peace if her death is avenged. Her main purpose is, however, to lure young men, seduced by either her looks or her voice, into the depths of said waterways where she would entangle their feet with her long red hair and submerge them. Her body would instantly become very slippery and not allow the victim to cling on to her body in order to reach the surface. She would then wait until the victim had drowned, or, on some occasions, tickle them to death, as she laughed. It is also believed, by a few accounts, that rusalki can change their appearance to match the tastes of men they are about to seduce, although a rusalka is generally considered to represent universal beauty, therefore is highly feared yet respected in Slavic culture.  Variations  Rusalka by Ivan Bilibin, 1934 While lore often says that the rusalki could not completely stand out of water, some fiction works tell of rusalki that could climb trees and sing songs, sit on docks with only submerged feet and comb their hair, or even join other rusalki in circle dances in the field. A particular feature of such stories revolves around the fact that this behaviour would be limited to only certain periods of the year, usually the summer (see Rusalka Week section). = Region-specific = Specifics pertaining to rusalki differed among regions. Although in most tales they lived without men, in Ukraine they were often linked with water (in Belarus they were linked with the forest and field). Where land was fertile, the maidens appeared naked and beautiful. In Russia, they appeared as women who come out of the water on Kupala night and participate in the festival without harming anyone, and in harsher areas they were pictured as \\"large- breasted amazons\\". However, sometimes they tickled men to death. According to some Russian beliefs, rusalki had the appearance of very pale little girls with green hair and long arms. In other beliefs, they were described as naked girls with light brown hair. In Poland, water rusalki were younger and fair- haired, while the forest ones looked more mature and had black hair ‚Äì but in both cases, if someone looked up close, their hair turned green, and the faces became distorted. They killed their victims by tickling them to death or forcing them to participate in a frenzied dance. In Polish folklore, the term rusalka could also stand for boginka, dziwo≈ºona and various other entities.  Rusalka Week  The rusalki were believed to be at their most dangerous during the Rusalka Week (, ) in early June. At this time, they were supposed to have left their watery depths in order to swing on branches of birch and willow trees by night. Swimming during this week was strictly forbidden, lest mermaids would drag a swimmer down to the river bed. A common feature of the celebration of Rusalnaya was the ritual banishment or burial of the rusalki at the end of the week, which remained as entertainment in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine until the 1930s.Ivanits, Linda, Russian Folk Belief, p. 80.  Modern popular culture  Regarding representations of the rusalka in modern popular culture, folklorist Natalie Kononenko says, \\"the currently dominant presents her as something like a mermaid, though she is pictured as having legs rather than a fish tail ... The current view of the rusalka as a seductive or seduced woman was probably influenced by written literature. In the past, her image was more complex and she more closely resembled a nature spirit, found not only near water but in fields, forests, and mountains, rather like the vila ...\\".Kononenko, Natalie. 2007.

This class is famous for being the sailing trainer vessel for many new entrants into the sport, and virtually every famous New Zealand yachtsman, including Sir Peter Blake and Russell Coutts, learnt to sail in one. The P-Class was for many years the most common sailing boat in New Zealand.  Origin  The P-Class was designed by New Zealand civil engineer, Harry Highet, as a simple vessel in which children and young people could learn to sail. It is a 2.13 metre long, slab sided, v bottom single hull, single sail Bermuda rigged dinghy, and is designed to be sailed by one person. The low aspect ratio Bermudan rig took over from a gunter rig in the 1950s. The boom overhangs the stern of the boat. It has a small deep cockpit with the rest of the hull making water tight buoyancy compartments. When capsized the boat floats very high in the water. The hull has a minimum weight of 90 lbs so is very solid. Even 40-year-old boats can be bought in good condition. The first example appeared at Onerahi near Whangarei on New Year's Day, 1920. However it was not until Highet and his family moved to Tauranga in 1923 that the full potential of his design became apparent. Soon a fleet of a dozen or so boats were racing each weekend on Tauranga Harbour. The P-Class was initially known as the \\"Tauranga Class\\". Boats carried the letter \\"P\\" on their sails, to indicate they were primary trainers. By 1940, an Inter- Provincial Competition had been established for the P Class, but this was held only in 1940 and 1941, before lapsing for the rest of World War Two. The competition resumed in 1945, with sailors racing for the Tanner Cup, a trophy donated by Mr George Tanner. A separate Inter-Club competition for the Tauranga Cup began at about the same time. Both competitions are still held annually. Originally built of solid wood, plywood was introduced in 1956 and fibreglass hulls were allowed in 1975. Aluminium spars were introduced in 1976 and carbon fibre - composite masts, in 1998. The class is a one design class with tight building restrictions ensuring that hulls spars sails and foils are very similar in weight and dimensions. A beginner's boat sells for $300 NZ and a top racing boat about $3000‚Äì5000NZ. Racing boats have a full range of double sided sail controls with masts and foils made of carbon fibre, and at least 2 quality sails for different wind strengths. The P class is generally sailed by boys and girls from 11 to 15. Because of its short length it is difficult to sail down wind in waves so children develop advanced sailing skills at a young age.

Aubrey Smith. Set during the reign of Queen Victoria, it tells the story of a man accused of cowardice. It is widely regarded as the best of the numerous film adaptations of the 1902 novel of the same name by A.E.W. Mason. Plot In 1895, the Royal North Surrey Regiment is called to active service to join the army of Sir Herbert Kitchener in the Mahdist War against the forces of the Khalifa (John Laurie). Forced into an army career by family tradition and fearful he might prove a coward in battle, Lieutenant Harry Faversham (John Clements) resigns his commission on the eve of its departure. As a result, his three friends and fellow officers, Captain John Durrance (Ralph Richardson) and Lieutenants Burroughs (Donald Gray) and Willoughby (Jack Allen), show their contempt for his action by each sending him a white feather attached to a calling card. When his fianc√©e, Ethne Burroughs (June Duprez), says nothing in his defence, he bitterly demands a fourth from her. She refuses, but he plucks one from her fan. Harry confides in an old mentor and former surgeon in his father's regiment, Dr. Sutton (Frederick Culley), that he now realises he did act out of cowardice and must attempt to redeem himself. He departs for Egypt. There, he disguises himself as a despised mute Sangali native, with the help of Dr. Harraz (Henry Oscar), to hide his lack of knowledge of the local languages. Faversham (left) guiding the blind Durrance through the desert to safety During the army's advance, Durrance is ordered to take his company into the desert to lure the Khalifa's army away from the Nile so that Kitchener's army can sail past. Durrance is blinded by sunstroke, and the company is overrun. He is left for dead on the battlefield, while Burroughs and Willoughby are captured. However, the disguised Faversham takes the delirious Durrance across the desert and down the Nile to the vicinity of a British fort. As he is putting something into Durrance's wallet, Faversham is spotted and mistaken for a robber. He is placed in a convict gang, but escapes. Six months later, the blind Durrance has returned to England. Out of pity, Ethne agrees to marry him. At dinner with Ethne, her father, and Dr. Sutton, as Durrance is relating the tale of his miraculous rescue, he pulls out a keepsake letter from Ethne, the only thing he had in his wallet during the \\"robbery\\". A white feather and his card drop out, revealing to the others that his rescuer was Harry Faversham. Nobody has the heart to tell him. Burroughs and Willoughby are thrown into a dungeon in Omdurman with other enemies of the Khalifa. Still playing the addled Sangali, Faversham surreptitiously gives them hope of escape and passes them a file, but arouses the suspicions of the guards. He is flogged and imprisoned with the others. He reveals his identity to his friends and organizes an escape during Kitchener's attack. Faversham leads the other prisoners in overpowering their guards and seizing the Khalifa's arsenal, where they hold until the arrival of Kitchener's forces. Durrance learns of Faversham's deeds from a newspaper account and realises it was Harry who saved him. He dictates a letter to Ethne, releasing her from their engagement on the false pretext of going to Germany for a prolonged course of treatment to restore his eyesight. Some time later, Harry attends a dinner with his friends and Ethne, where General Burroughs (C. Aubrey Smith), Ethne's father, acknowledges that Harry has forced all of them to take back their feathers‚Äîall except Ethne. Faversham playfully makes her take back her white feather by the courageous act of interrupting the General in the midst of his favourite war story about the Battle of Balaclava to correct his embellishments; the irritated Burroughs complains that he will never be able to tell that story again.

The complex, designed by Solomon, Cordwell, Buenz and Associates and developed by Urban West Associates, consists of two skyscrapers that share a common townhouse podium. It is part of the San Francisco Skyline and is visible from Mt. Diablo, Port of Oakland and San Francisco. The taller tower, One Rincon Hill South Tower, was completed in 2008 and stands 60 stories and 641 feet (195 m) tall. The shorter tower, marketed as Tower Two at One Rincon Hill, was completed in 2014 and reaches a height of 541 feet (165 m) with 50 stories. The South Tower contains high-speed elevators with special features for moving residents effectively, and a large water tank designed to help the skyscraper withstand strong winds and earthquakes. Both skyscrapers and the townhomes contain a total of 709 residential units. The building site, located right next to the western approach of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge, formerly contained a clock tower. The clock tower was demolished shortly after the city approved the One Rincon Hill project. Construction of the townhomes and the South Tower lasted from 2005 to 2008, but was stopped for brief periods of time due to seismic concerns and a construction accident. As the South Tower neared completion, it generated controversy concerning view encroachment, high pricing, and architectural style. Description =Location= The complex is on a parcel on the apex of the Rincon Hill neighborhood. The site is bounded by Harrison Street to the northwest, the Fremont Street exit ramp to the north, the approach to the Bay Bridge (Interstate 80) on the east, and the 1st Street entrance ramp to the southwest. =Developer and architect= Solomon, Cordwell, Buenz and Associates, a Chicago architectural firm, designed the complex. The developer of this complex is Urban West Associates, headed by Mike Kriozere. The developer's headquarters are in San Diego, although all its highrise projects over 14 stories are in the San Francisco Bay Area. The Rincon Hill complex is the developer's second project in San Francisco, with the first being ONE Embarcadero South, a residential complex near One Rincon Hill and across from Oracle Park. According to the developer the total cost of the Rincon Hill project was US$290 million, rising to over US$310 million in 2009. =Architecture= One Rincon Hill, viewed from the south in 2015 The complex consists of two buildings joined together at the base by a row of townhomes. The South Tower and North Tower rise and above the corner of Fremont and Harrison streets, respectively. The North Tower has 50 floors, while the South Tower has 60. Because of the sloped Rincon Hill site, the South Tower's lobby floor or the 1st Street entrance is on the sixth floor, and the first floor is five levels underground from the 1st Street entrance. It is also one of the tallest all-residential towers west of the Mississippi River. Its location near the apex of Rincon Hill, at an elevation of over , gives it an apparent height of well over , making it one of the biggest additions to the San Francisco skyline in over 30 years.One Rincon Hill Aerial Tour, found on One Rincon Hill's website Both the north tower and the south tower of the Rincon Hill complex bear a resemblance to The Heritage at Millennium Park in Chicago, a building of a similar height to the south tower also designed by Solomon, Cordwell, Buenz and Associates. The architectural style for both buildings of the Rincon Hill complex is late-modernist. The three sides of the South Tower facing east, north, and west have a linear glass curtainwall. The North Tower has a similar design, except it is shorter and the curved aluminum and glass side faces northwest. Both skyscrapers of the Rincon Hill project contain an oval-shaped crown housing mechanical equipment.  Weather beacon  The crown of the South Tower contains a band of 25 LED floodlights that remain lit all night. Each LED light consumes little energy and has a lifetime of 40,000 hours. These lights are used to signal the weather, just like the lights on the Berkeley Building in Boston. The crown glows red if warmer weather is in the forecast. A blue crown signifies that cold weather is expected soon. Green means that there is at least a 50 percent chance of rain. Amber indicates that the weather will remain unchanged. This is the San Francisco Bay Area's first weather beacon. The crown began lighting up on December 8, 2008. =Earthquake engineering= To support the 60 story condo tower, One Rincon Hill South Tower has a massive thick pile-raft foundation embedded deep into serpentine rock. Although some engineers view serpentine rock with suspicion, there are massive structures, such as the Golden Gate Bridge, that have foundations on rock that is largely serpentine. Rising out of the foundation are the concrete core and large, tall columns of steel-reinforced concrete called outriggers. The core is attached to the outrigger columns by diagonal, steel buckling-restrained braces which are designed to dissipate energy during an earthquake through controlled hysteretic behavior. This type of advanced seismic system performs in a manner similar to that of shock absorbers. The braces are also encased in concrete and steel to further mitigate risk of buckling and strength loss. Also of note is the controlled-rocking system which features vertical post-tensioning which runs the height of the building through ducts within the reinforced-concrete shear-wall core. Many of these technologies used in the One Rincon Hill South Tower have never before been applied in the United States. =Water tanks= At the top of the building is a large tuned sloshing damper which holds up to 50,000 gallons (189,250 litres) of water and weighs 416,500 pounds (185,440 kg). A similar 50,000 gallon (189,250 liter) tank is located in the basement for firefighting purposes. There are two liquid damper screens in each tank to control the flow of the water to counter the sway from the powerful Pacific winds, which can reach hurricane-force. =Elevators= The South Tower has one freight and three passenger elevators. The elevators are the second fastest in the city of San Francisco, second only to those in 555 California Street and tied with those in 555 Mission Street. The elevators of the South Tower can travel from the ground floor to the 61st floor (the mechanical level) in only 26 seconds to speed passenger traffic flow. This means the elevators can travel about 1,200 vertical feet (366 m) in a minute. The elevators have artificial intelligence control systems that figure out passenger traffic patterns and dispatch the three elevators to handle passenger needs accordingly. The bottom of each elevator shaft has a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil to stop a falling elevator without injuring the passengers inside. =Residences= The entire project will provide 695 condos in the highrises and 14 townhomes at the foot of the towers for a total of 709 units. 376 of those condo units are located in the South Tower and the North Tower contains the other 319 units. Because of their height, both towers will offer spectacular vistas of the surrounding landscapes. There are 26 different floor plans for the 695 condos which are financially beyond the reach of many citizens residing in San Francisco. The units vary greatly in price from US$500,000 to depending on view and the size of the unit that range from . The project opened up a sales office on June 16, 2006 and even before the opening, condo-buyers placed deposits for 130 of the South Tower's 376 condo units in a selling spree. The Sales Center is rumored to have cost to build. The condo units in One Rincon Hill South Tower sold well for an unfinished building at that time. The first residents began moving into the South Tower in February 2008. History South tower in mid-July 2007 =Prelude= The triangle-section clock tower, owned by Union 76 and then Bank of America, was built on the site circa 1955. After the Transbay Plan the city changed the zoning in the Rincon Hill neighborhood and raised height limits. A second version of One Rincon Hill was proposed in response to these zoning changes, in which the height was increased to 60 stories. The second version project was approved by the city on August 4, 2005. Before construction of One Rincon Hill, the clock tower was razed to make way for the construction of the towers. =South Tower= Three months after San Francisco approved the project, construction began on the South Tower with a groundbreaking ceremony on November 10, 2005. The South Tower was the second-tallest tower under construction in San Francisco. July 2006 construction accident Construction site and tower crane as of July 16, 2006, a few days before the accident. On July 21, 2006, a metal construction deck collapsed sometime around 10:45 AM (UTC‚àí7). Two carpenters and two ironworkers were injured when they fell about 30 feet ( 2.5 stories ) feet (6 m) along with the deck, sending all four men to the hospital. Three of the men were released that afternoon; one of the ironworkers was kept at the hospital with his leg broken in two places, a broken ankle, and a broken shoulder. Progress The South Tower was completed in September 2008, with all residential floors ready for residents. As of, April 2009, 70% of the South Tower's 376 luxury units and 14 townhouses had been sold. Because of the occupancy rate and low profits so far, the developers had initially refused to pay $5.4 million in development fees that would be spent on rent subsidies, job training programs and community development in the South of Market area. However, the developers finally agreed to pay the city.

Originally, construction was supposed to commence in January 2008. Later, the developer mentioned construction was going start in March, but the construction firm wasn't selected at that time. After March, the developer said construction was going to start in May 2008. However, following the worldwide financial crisis of the late summer and fall of 2008, the project's developers announced that construction of the second tower was indefinitely on hold. With improving economic conditions in the city, construction started on this tower on October 2012; its first residents moved in August 2014. The north tower was later renamed The Harrison.  Criticism  With condo prices set from US$500,000 to US$2 million, many critics have noted that the One Rincon Hill complex is too expensive for most San Franciscans. With the total initial development cost of US$290 million, the average development cost per unit with 709 units total is approximately US$409,000. However, the developer Urban West Associates has contributed a total of US$38.5 million to funds like the South of Market Community Stabilization Fund in order to address this concern. Notes :A. This article measures the building height and floor count of both towers from the corner of Fremont and Harrison Streets. :B. Building height and number of floors varies depending on the measuring location and whether the five underground levels, the lobby and the topmost two mechanical levels are included in the measurement. Sources like the corresponding SkyscraperPage thread list the tower at tall with 60 floors, leaving out the topmost two levels. Source. However, the San Francisco project rundown thread on the same site lists the tower at with only 55 floors, omitting the five underground and topmost two non-residential levels. Source. Emporis lists the building at 605 feet (184 m) and omits the lobby level in addition to the seven nonresidential levels from the floor count, leading to a count of 54 floors. Source. Another site gives no height figure but mentions the tower has 62 levels. Source.

Kennedy on June 4, 1963. This executive order amended Executive Order 10289 (dated September 17, 1951)Executive Order 10289 by delegating to the Secretary of the Treasury the president's authority to issue silver certificates under the Thomas Amendment of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended by the Gold Reserve Act. The order allowed the Secretary to issue silver certificates, if any were needed, during the transition period under President Kennedy's plan to eliminate Silver Certificates and use Federal Reserve Notes.https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/message-the-congress- presenting-the-presidents-first-economic-report Background On November 28, 1961, President Kennedy halted sales of silver by the Treasury Department. Increasing demand for silver as an industrial metal had led to an increase in the market price of silver above the United States government's fixed price. This led to a decline in the government's excess silver reserves by over 80% during 1961. Kennedy also called upon Congress to phase out silver certificates in favor of Federal Reserve notes which, according to the Associated Press at that time, were still backed by gold. Kennedy repeated his calls for Congress to act on several occasions, including his 1963 Economic Report, where he wrote:Economic Report of the President, p. XXIII. January 21, 1963. House document No. 28, 88th Congress, 1st Session. U.S. Govt. Printing Office. > I again urge a revision in our silver policy to reflect the status of silver > as a metal for which there is an expanding industrial demand. Except for its > use in coins, silver serves no useful monetary function. In 1961, at my > direction, sales of silver were suspended by the Secretary of the Treasury. > As further steps, I recommend repeal of those Acts that oblige the Treasury > to support the price of silver; and repeal of the special 50-percent tax on > transfers of interest in silver and authorization for the Federal Reserve > System to issue notes in denominations of $1, so as to make possible the > gradual withdrawal of silver certificates from circulation and the use of > the silver thus released for coinage purposes. I urge the Congress to take > prompt action on these recommended changes. Public Law 88-36 The House of Representatives took up the president's request early in 1963,Silver Legislation, April 3, 1963, House of Representatives Report No. 183, 88th Congress, 1st Session. and passed HR 5389 on April 10, 1963, by a vote of 251 to 122. The Senate passed the bill on May 23, by a vote of 68 to 10. Kennedy signed the bill into law on June 4, 1963 and, on the same day, signed an executive order (11110) authorizing the Treasury Secretary to continue printing silver certificates during the transition period. The act, which became Public Law 88-36 (77 Stat. 54), repealed the Silver Purchase Act of 1934 and related laws, repealed a tax on silver transfers, and authorized the Federal Reserve to issue one- and two- dollar bills, in addition to the notes they were already issuing.Public Law 88-36, 77 Stat. 54, United States Statutes at Large, Vol. 77 (1963), p. 54, U.S. Govt. Printing Office. The Silver Purchase Act had authorized and required the Secretary of the Treasury to buy silver and issue silver certificates. With its repeal, the President needed to delegate to the Treasury Secretary the President's own authority under the Agricultural Adjustment Act. Text of Executive Order President Kennedy's Executive Order (E.O.) 11110 modified the pre-existing Executive Order 10289 issued by U.S. President Harry S. Truman on September 17, 1951, and stated the following:Text of Executive Order 11110 at The American Presidency Project E.O. 10289 then lists tasks (a) through (h) which the Secretary may now do without instruction from the President. None of the powers assigned to the Treasury in E.O. 10289 relate to money or to monetary policy. President Kennedy's E.O. 11110, in its entirety, follows: Revocation In March 1964, Secretary of the Treasury C. Douglas Dillon halted redemption of silver certificates for silver dollars. On June 24, 1968, all redemption in silver ceased. In the 1970s, large numbers of the remaining silver dollars in the mint vaults were sold to the collecting public for collector value. In 1982, Congress repealed the remaining legislative authority behind E.O. 11110 with the passage of . On September 9, 1987, as part of a general clean-up of executive orders, President Ronald Reagan issued Executive Order 12608, which removed the text which had been added to E.O. 10289 by E.O. 11110. Specifically, E.O. 12608 revoked subparagraph (j) of paragraph 1 of E.O. 10289, as amended by E.O. 11110.Text of Executive Order 12608 Although E.O. 12608 explicitly revoked the relevant portion of E.O. 10289 which had been added by E.O. 11110, thereby effectively revoking E.O. 11110 as such, the original legislative authority underpinning the order had, of course, already been nullified five years earlier, back in 1982. JFK assassination theory Jim Marrs, in his book Crossfire, presented the theory that Kennedy was trying to rein in the power of the Federal Reserve, and that forces opposed to such action might have played at least some part in the assassination.; reprinted with footnotes in Marrs alleges that the issuance of Executive Order 11110 was an effort by Kennedy to transfer power from the Federal Reserve to the United States Department of the Treasury by replacing Federal Reserve Notes with silver certificates. Author Richard Belzer named the responsible parties in this theory as American \\"billionaires, power brokers, and bankers ... working in tandem with the CIA and other sympathetic agents of the government.\\" Critics of the theory note that Executive Order 11110 was a technicality that only delegated existing presidential powers to the Secretary of the Treasury for administrative convenience during a period of transition.

One of its aims is to clarify the mathematical foundations of quantum theory and its statistical interpretation. A significant recent application to physics is the dynamical solution of the quantum measurement problem, by giving constructive models of quantum observation processes which resolve many famous paradoxes of quantum mechanics. Some recent advances are based on quantum filtering and feedback control theory as applications of quantum stochastic calculus.  Orthodox quantum mechanics  Orthodox quantum mechanics has two seemingly contradictory mathematical descriptions: # deterministic unitary time evolution (governed by the Schr√∂dinger equation) and # stochastic (random) wavefunction collapse. Most physicists are not concerned with this apparent problem. Physical intuition usually provides the answer, and only in unphysical systems (e.g., Schr√∂dinger's cat, an isolated atom) do paradoxes seem to occur. Orthodox quantum mechanics can be reformulated in a quantum- probabilistic framework, where quantum filtering theory (see Bouten et al. for introduction or Belavkin, 1970s) gives the natural description of the measurement process. This new framework encapsulates the standard postulates of quantum mechanics, and thus all of the science involved in the orthodox postulates. = Motivation = In classical probability theory, information is summarized by the sigma-algebra F of events in a classical probability space (Œ©, F,P). For example, F could be the œÉ-algebra œÉ(X) generated by a random variable X, which contains all the information on the values taken by X. We wish to describe quantum information in similar algebraic terms, in such a way as to capture the non-commutative features and the information made available in an experiment. The appropriate algebraic structure for observables, or more generally operators, is a *-algebra. A (unital) *- algebra is a complex vector space A of operators on a Hilbert space H that * contains the identity I and * is closed under composition (a multiplication) and adjoint (an involution *): a ‚àà A implies a* ‚àà A. A state P on A is a linear functional P : A ‚Üí C (where C is the field of complex numbers) such that 0 ‚â§ P(a* a) for all a ‚àà A (positivity) and P(I) = 1 (normalization). A projection is an element p ‚àà A such that p2 = p = p*.  Mathematical definition  The basic definition in quantum probability is that of a quantum probability space, sometimes also referred to as an algebraic or noncommutative probability space. :Definition : Quantum probability space. A quantum probability space is a pair (A, P), where A is a *-algebra and P is a state. This definition is a generalization of the definition of a probability space in Kolmogorovian probability theory, in the sense that every (classical) probability space gives rise to a quantum probability space if A is chosen as the *-algebra of almost everywhere bounded complex-valued measurable functions. The idempotents p ‚àà A are the events in A, and P(p) gives the probability of the event p.

Built in 1926, the building is Peoria's only surviving example of an upscale 1920s hotel. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description Philadelphia architect Horace Trumbauer was the lead architect for the hotel. Trumbauer designed many prominent homes and public buildings on the East Coast, including several upscale hotels; his design for the P√®re Marquette was inspired by both his earlier hotel designs and other contemporary hotels such as the Waldorf- Astoria. Herbert Hewitt, a prominent local architect responsible for many of Peoria's major buildings of the period, collaborated with Trumbauer on the project. The fourteen-story building is mainly built from brick and stone. Its exterior design mainly emphasizes symmetry and linearity, a common architectural trend at the time. Stone window treatments surround the second- story windows, and a stone cornice with carved Native American and animal faces encircles the top of the building. The hotel is located directly across the street from the Madison Theatre building and a half block from Peoria City Hall; both buildings are also on the National Register. The original first floor included a grand lobby and three large meeting rooms. The Cotillion Room, the hotel's original ballroom, features a high domed ceiling, French window mirrors, and decorative plasterwork. The LaSalle Room and the Cheminee Lounge both originally featured high ceilings with crystal chandeliers, though the original crystal was removed from the Cheminee Lounge. The lobby and the Cotillion Room both originally had murals by George Matthews Harding; the lobby mural depicted P√®re Marquette landing at Peoria, while the Cotillion Room mural showed Sieur de La Salle leaving France. The hotel features 288 guest rooms. History Planning for the hotel began in 1924, when several of Peoria's business leaders decided that the city needed a high-end hotel. Led by Emmet C. May, the business leaders enlisted hotel manager Horace Leland Wiggins to oversee the new hotel. A sweepstakes was held to choose the hotel's name; the winning entry, Hotel P√®re Marquette, a common name for Father Jacques Marquette, received $50. The hotel was completed in 1926 for $2.5 million (now $ million after inflation), and its grand opening was held in January 1927. The building's designers were primarily from the East Coast, and the hotel was heavily influenced by the luxurious hotels that were popular there in the 1920s. It was one of two major high-end hotels in Peoria at the time, along with the Jefferson Hotel, and is the only one which is still operating. Renovations took place in 1954 and in 1961. The hotel had further renovations in 1972 when the P√®re Marquette joined the Hilton Hotel chain, as the Peoria Hilton and a renovation and restoration in 1981. The hotel later left the Hilton chain and reverted to its original name. On August 12, 1982, the hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The Peoria City Council approved the final agreement with developer Gary Matthews to close the hotel for an extensive renovation and expansion into a full-service, upscale Marriott hotel. The Hotel was closed December 2, 2011 to begin these renovations and reopened in June 2013.http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/piamc-peoria-marriott-p%C3%A8re- marquette References External links *Peoria Marriott Pere Marquette -- Official website Skyscraper hotels in Illinois Buildings and structures in Peoria, Illinois Skyscrapers in Illinois National Register of Historic Places in Peoria County, Illinois Hotels established in 1926 Hotel buildings completed in 1926 Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois 1926 establishments in Illinois ","title":"Peoria Marriott Pere Marquette"},{"id":"5714324","text":"Vecchiali at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.

He attended the University of Sydney, from which he earned a Bachelor of Architecture. Arrest, trial, and aftermath On 26 October 2003, following an investigation by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, police and ASIO raided Lodhi's Lakemba home and workplace and discovered evidence of a terrorist plot. He was accused of plotting to bomb the national electricity grid and/or Sydney defence sites in the cause of violent jihad. His possible targets were the national electricity supply system and three Sydney defence installations; the army base Victoria Barracks, the naval base HMAS Penguin, and the army training area Holsworthy Barracks. During his trial, the court was told he and Willie Brigitte, who was deported in October 2003 for breaching his tourist visa, trained in Pakistan with Lashkar-e-Toiba and had contact using mobile phones registered under false names. The court was also told he helped arrange accommodation for Brigitte when he arrived in Sydney, in May 2003. At the ruling, Justice Anthony Wheally commented that Lodhi had \\"the intent of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause, namely violent jihad\\" and to \\"instil terror into members of the public so that they could never again feel free from the threat of bombing in Australia\\".

Formed during the cultural renaissance that accompanied the Chicano Movement, Self Help, as it is sometimes called, was one of the primary centers that incubated the nascent Chicano art movement, and remains important in the Chicano art movement, as well as in the greater Los Angeles community, today. SHG also hosts musical and other performances, and organizes Los Angeles's annual Day of the Dead festivities. Throughout its history, the organization has worked with well-known artists in the Los Angeles area such as Los Four and the East Los Streetscapers, but it has focused primarily on training and giving exposure to young and new artists, many of whom have gone on to national and international prominence. History In 1970, artist and Franciscan nun Karen Boccalero started producing prints in an East Los Angeles garage with Chicano artists Carlos Bueno, Antonio Ib√°√±ez, Frank Hern√°ndez, and others. They decided to work together to promote community arts and the work of local artists, to use art as an instrument of social change in the barrio, and to establish a cultural arts center. The artists had their first exhibition the following year at an East Los Angeles shopping center called El Mercado. In 1972, the organization, which until that time went by the name Art Inc., was renamed Self Help Graphics & Art when it found a home in a suite on the third floor of an office building at 2111 Brooklyn Avenue in Boyle Heights. The 2,000 square-foot (186 m2) space was financed by Order of the Sisters of St. Francis, who donated $10,000. The following year, the space was expanded to 9,000 square feet (836 m2) with a grant from the Campaign for Human Development. The first official activity of the organization was an inaugural batik and silkscreen workshop that ended with a group exhibition. Participating artists paid a small fee and provided their own materials. Thus began the Self Help tradition of instructing budding artists in graphic arts techniques. Shortly thereafter, funds provided by the California Arts Council allowed the hiring of artists Peter Tovar, Michael Amescua, Fernando Amozorrutia, Carlos Bueno, Victor Du Bois, Jeff Gates, Linda Orozco, Jesse Rays, Carla Webber, Silvia Chavez, and Linda Vallejo as arts instructors. The first Day of the Dead Celebration in the USA began in 1974 at SHG. At first, material support for Self Help was scarce. Boccalero raised funds from Beverly Hills art enthusiasts and sought donations from art stores, museums, and Catholic organizations. In 1974, the artists realized that in order to accomplish their goal of creating a permanent home for a community arts center, they would need the support of major institutions such as the National Endowment for the Arts. Boccalero attended grant-writing workshops and hired professional administrative staff, including a bilingual office manager supplied by the American GI Forum's SER-Jobs for Progress. In 1979, Self Help relocated to its former location in a large building on the corner of Cesar Chavez Avenue (formerly Brooklyn Avenue) and Gage Street. The building, which is owned by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, was previously home to the Catholic Youth Organization, which rented space for dances and meetings. Under the terms of the lease, which was renewable every ten years, Self Help was to pay one dollar per year in rent. According to cultural historian Kristen Guzm√°n, \\"From [...] correspondence involving Sister Karen and members of her community, as well as the Franciscan priests of Santa Barbara and Oakland, it is evident that the Church was vital to Self Help's existence in this period\\".Guzm√°n, 10. The former Self Help building contained a gallery, Galer√≠a Otra Vez, a printing room, office, studio space for artists-in-residence, and storage areas in two stories. Today the exterior walls of the building are adorned with embedded ceramic pieces, mosaics, and murals. The large statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe that stood in the parking lot has been relocated to the new building in Boyle Heights. The mosaic work was done by the artist Eduardo Oropeza. Boccalero functioned as executive director until her death in 1997, at which point she was succeeded by Tom√°s Ben√≠tez. In May 2005, the artist Gustavo LeClerc became the center's new artistic director, and was charged with broadening Self Help's horizons.Hernandez. The personnel changes may have been symptoms of larger problems. Ben√≠tez stepped down in March 2005 as a financial crisis became public knowledge. On June 7, 2005, the doors of Self Help were locked and the staff was dismissed.Vallen. The unforeseen nature of the closure evoked an angry reaction from the artists affiliated with the center and the community at large. A series of meetings were held to ensure that the closure was only temporary and to pre-empt any potential future problems resulting from lack of funding or the lack of organizational transparency. Apparently, the trouble started when it was discovered that the building was in need of repairs. Numerous fundraisers were held, including a benefit concert by Ozomatli. But they were not enough to cover the repairs necessary, which raised safety issues for Self Help's workers and liability concerns for the organization. There was the additional complication of the ownership of the building, which still belonged to the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Most recently, news became public that Self Help had been sold by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. The former owners, the Sisters of Saint Francis, said they asked the Archdiocese to facilitate the sale of the building. Sister Carol Snyder said it became untenable to support a venture that did not make money. Several attempts were made by Self Help to purchase the building and were rejected by the new owners. It not being financially feasible for the not-for-profit organization to continue paying rent, it was able to secure a new space and in March 2011 moved to 1300 East First Street, Los Angeles, CA 90033. The mosaic statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe was also transported to the new location. Programs =Barrio Mobile Art Studio= In 1974, Self Help began a program called the Barrio Mobile Art Studio (BMAS). The BMAS was a large van that was equipped with art supplies. Its mission was \\"to develop the individual's aesthetic appreciation, to provide an alternative mode of self- expression, and to increase the individual's appreciation of Chicano culture.\\" On weekdays, the BMAS visited public and parochial schools and taught photography, batik, sculpture, puppetry, and filmmaking. On weekends, the van went to neighborhoods in Boyle Heights, City Terrace, and Lincoln Heights to provide art materials and training to people of all ages. Participation was encouraged even among members of street gangs, who used the materials to publish a newsletter about gang activity. The program, although phased out in 1985, served as a model for similar programs in Los Angeles and elsewhere. =Atelier program= In 1982, Self Help began an \\"Experimental Screenprint Atelier\\", a workshop in fine art serigraphy. Serigraphy was a technique that was more expensive and required greater expertise than the silkscreening. As such, it represented a departure from the Chicano sensibility of rasquachismo, or a humorous sense of pride in being able to make do with limited resources. Nonetheless, it gave artists greater latitude for individual expression, and created a higher-quality product, which resulted in greater prestige for both the artists and the center. The shift was also a means to concentrate the center's resources, which were becoming limited due to Reagan Administration- era cutbacks in social spending. The production of higher-quality works also opened up the possibility of funding Self Help activities through the sales of prints. Stephen Rose was the first master printer, Oscar Duardo the second, and Jos√© Alpuche, the third masterprinter (1979‚Äì2011). Ateliers are held at least twice a year, and usually center around a specific theme. For example, when residents were being evicted from the Wilshire Corridor, artists produced prints accusing the city of gentrification. Other themes have included the Virgin of Guadalupe, AIDS, the 1992 Los Angeles riots, and the poet Sor Juana. Special projects are also undertaken, such as the Maestras Atelier, a workshop for female artists. The first Maestras Atelier took place in 1999 and featured artists such as Yreina Cervantez, Barbara Carrasco and Laura E. Alvarez. =Chicano Expressions= \\"Chicano Expressions\\" was an internationally touring exhibit funded by the United States Information Agency to \\"provide exposure to American values and culture\\". The exhibit, which featured work from 20 artists, toured South Africa, Colombia, Honduras, Germany, France, and Spain in 1993. Boccalero found funding to allow some of the artists and Self Help staff to travel with the exhibition, which fostered networking between artists from the countries visited. Self Help Graphics & Art was invited to Glasgow, Scotland, by the artists of the Glasgow Print Studio in October 1996 to collaborate on Day of the Dead workshops and celebrations there. Day of the Dead The revival of the indigenous holiday D√≠a de los Muertos was part of the Mexican-American reclamation of indigenous identity, an important social aspect of the Chicano Movement. Self Help played an integral role in the holiday's revival in California.Romo, 5. The first celebration was in 1974, and by 1978 it had become an event requiring $14,000 in funding. Today, the Day of the Dead is one of Los Angeles's major celebrations, and receives funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, among other sources. Preparation generally begins in August with papel picado-making, altar-making, and printmaking workshops for children and adults. On November 1, participants, many of whom paint their faces as calaveras, proceed down Cesar Chavez to Evergreen Cemetery, where personal and family altars are set up and food is (pan de muerto) offered to the deceased family members there interred. Sometimes a mass is celebrated there. Then attendees return to Self Help, where altars, ofrendas, prints, and other works are exhibited. Often there are musical and theatrical performances. In 1978, Luis Valdez's Teatro Campesino performed El Fin del Mundo as part of the program. The event has not only been the occasion to, as a promotional brochure explains, \\"learn about the important role that heritage and tradition play in defining who we are\\", but has also been used to make artistic and political statements. In 1974, the Chicano conceptual and performance art group Asco took advantage of the opportunity to confront a by-then entrenched social and political culture with an irreverent \\"invasion\\". In the midst of ceremonies attended by Los Angeles's political elite, Harry Gamboa Jr., Patssi Valdez, Gronk, and Willie Herr√≥n were \\"delivered\\" in a giant envelope marked postage due. They emerged in wild costumes, acting out their \\"absurdist message\\". The piece was a challenge to Self Help's orthodox interpretation of the holiday. According to Gronk, \\"We were originally asked to come in to do a piece.\\" But after being shown a film about Mexico's Day of the Dead, \\"we sort of rolled our eyes like, 'Are we gonna repeat that?' Just like, 'That's fine for somewhere else, but not for us.' Day of the Dead can mean a lot of different of things, and it doesn't necessarily mean paper cutouts, skull heads. We can invent it, what it means to us.\\"Guzm√°n, 13. The Day of the Dead has taken a political bent when used to mourn those who have died from the political violence. As such, it has occasionally been used as a vehicle to artistically criticize the policies of the United States, especially as they affect the Latino community. Altars to honor the victims of the Iraq War that incorporate text or images highlighting the high casualty rate among Latino soldiers are an example of such. In 2000, the Mexican Museum in San Francisco dedicated its exhibition \\"Chicanos en Mictl√°n: D√≠a de los Muertos en California\\" to Day of the Dead celebrations at Self Help and San Francisco's Galer√≠a de la Raza. In 2009 the Day of the Dead Celebration had grown too large to be held in the Self Help parking lot. The celebration was moved to its current location at East Los Angeles Civic Center on 3rd Street and Mednik Avenue.

Simply put, the control signal is a DC voltage that varies between zero and ten volts. There are two recognized standards current sourcing, and current sinking.  Current Sourcing  Typically used in commercial and theatrical dimming, the controller sends volts to the device. The controlled lighting should scale its output so that at 10 V, the controlled light should be at 100% of its potential output, and at 0 V it should at 0% output (i.e., off). Dimming devices may be designed to respond in various patterns to the intermediate voltages, giving output curves that are linear for: voltage output, actual light output, power output, or perceived light output. Receivers have a nominal input impedance of 100¬±20 kŒ© (i.e., maximum 1.0¬±0.2 mW at 10 V) 0-10V dimmer In production lighting this system was replaced by analog multiplexed systems such as D54 and AMX192, which themselves have been almost completely replaced by DMX512. For dimmable fluorescent lamps (where it operates instead at 1‚Äì10 V, where 1 V is minimum and 0 V is off), the system is being replaced by DSI, which itself is in the process of being replaced by DALI.  Current Sinking  Typically utilized in architectural lighting, a current sinking control scheme uses ballast or driver provided 10V DC. The controller reduces the returned volts to the light. If the controller returns the full 10V, the light will be at its brightest level. The light will be at minimum level if no volts are returned. The current sinking scheme creates a fail safe situation. Should a control wire be cut or the controller fail, the lights will illuminate. Commonly, the 10V control voltage is supplied through a resistor. Control is achieved (and current is sunk) by connecting a variable resistor between the control voltage terminal and ground. The two resistors form a voltage divider to produce a control voltage Vc = Vs * (Rc / (Rc + Rs)) where Vc is the returned control voltage, Vs is the source voltage, Rc is the variable control resistance, and Rs is the source resistance. Vs may be greater than 10v so that a maximum intended value of Rc produces a 10V maximum control voltage. Rc must be adjusted to a value of 0 ohms (a direct short) to return a 0V control voltage. As a practical matter, many 0-10V dimming control inputs can be operated by replacing the variable control resistor with an electronic switch. When the switch is on, the control voltage is near 0 and the light is fully dim. When the switch is off, the control voltage is maximum and the light is fully bright. The switch is controlled by a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal, which alternately turns the switch on and off at a rapid rate. The relative proportion of off time vs. on time determines brightness. For example, if the switch is off 10% of the time, the resulting control signal would be the equivalent of 1V produced with a variable resistor. The PWM method does not require selection of accurate resistance values. It can be applied simultaneously to control signals of multiple lights by connecting their control inputs in parallel. Dimming fluorescent ballasts and dimming LED drivers often use 0‚Äì10 V control signals to control dimming functions. In many cases, the dimming range of the power supply or ballast is limited. If the light output can only be dimmed from 100% down to 10%, there must be a switch or relay available to kill power to the system and turn the light completely off. Some 0‚Äì10 V controllers offer a built-in line voltage relay, others require an external line voltage relay. Some 0-10V controllers, usually called 0-10V Blink'n'Dim adapters, create a 0-10V control signal in response to short blink signals from the power switch. Depending on the application, these options should be considered.  Advantages and disadvantages  The simplicity of the lighting system makes it straightforward to understand, implement and diagnose, and its low current (typically 1 mA) means it can be run along relatively thin cables with little voltage drop. However, since it requires one wire per control channel (plus a common return wire), a sophisticated system could have hundreds of wires, requiring expensive multicore cables and connectors. Over a long cable, the voltage drop requires every channel of the receiving device to be calibrated to compensate for the voltage losses. (This is only a theoretical limitation as the resistance of the thinnest practical wire is around 20 Œ©/1000 m.) Capacitive coupling from nearby AC power cables can affect the signal to the fitting and even cause flickering. Signal wire running parallel to power cables for a fair distance would need to be screened. This is particularly difficult when control wires must be run inside closed and previously wired walls. When using this system, one must take into consideration the actual application, since controlling office lights is not the same as controlling theatrical lighting. 0‚Äì10 V lighting control is widely used in commercial and industrial lighting by ballast manufacturers such as GE, Philips, Universal, Metrolight, Sylvania, Creative Lighting, and Lumascape.Mark 7 0-10V - Products - Philips Lighting ElectronicsMetrolight Electronic BallastsCreative Lighting There are distributed control approaches on the market today that can be installed inside or very near the fixture(s) to be controlled thus eliminating the wire runs and the voltage drop.

They are variable in colour and patterning; adults range from grey to dull pink to green or more commonly brown on the dorsal surface, occasionally with darker markings. The skin on the dorsum has low warts and two longitudinal skin folds with a second pair on the flanks. The belly is white and finely granular. A dark brown streak starts from the tip of the snout and runs across the tympanum and ends over the shoulder. A similarly coloured bar runs under the eye and another runs the length of the upper jaw. The tympanum is partially covered with a skin fold and is distinct. The back of the thighs range from flesh-coloured to dark blue and the groin is a pale blue-green colour. The rear toes have a slight webbing and front toes are free from webbing.Barker, J.; Grigg, G.C.; Tyler,M.J. (1995). A Field Guide to Australian Frogs. Surrey Beatty & Sons.

He made his first on-screen appearance in Neighbours' first episode on 18 March 1985. Danny became the first character to speak in the show. Danny's storylines focused on his troubled relationship with his father Max and his subsequent discovery that Tim Duncan is his real father, his friendship with Scott Robinson and his job as a bank teller. Danny moved away from Ramsay Street on 31 July 1986. In 2005, Clencie reprised his role as Danny for a cameo in Annalise Hartman's documentary on Ramsay Street. Casting Jason Donovan, who would later go on to play Scott Robinson, was initially offered the role of Danny Ramsay in 1984, when Neighbours was in its planning stages. Former The Sullivans actor, David Clencie was later cast as the sixteen-year-old Danny in 1985, when Clencie was twenty. Clencie starred in the first scene of the first episode and became the first person to speak on Neighbours. Clencie enjoyed the early days of the show and said \\"We'd have a good laugh, something that's probably missing a bit from a lot of television these days. And the directors went with it, they said 'this is great, let's do it'\\". Neighbours was axed after 170 episodes and Clencie said the cast were \\"gobsmacked\\". A few weeks later, he received a call from his agent who told him that Neighbours was starting again after Network Ten picked it up and they wanted him to be in it. They offered him a year's contract and Clencie accepted. He said \\"I was just elated, and most of the cast were, because we had really felt robbed at the time\\". Clencie and his character were written out of the show after just over a year. The departure was by mutual agreement between Clencie and the producers. Clencie said \\"I was offered three different contracts with the show, but after discussion it was decided I would take a break\\". Clencie later said he left without regret because he felt that Danny had nowhere left to go as a character. In 2005, Clencie was one of many ex-cast members who made a return to Neighbours to appear in an episode celebrating the show's 20th anniversary. On his return, Clencie said \\"I went back as my character Danny for the twentieth anniversary a couple of years ago, and I couldn't actually believe that people would remember me. I was welcomed with open arms and did my little scene as Danny, you know, 'where is he now?'. He's building pools in Brisbane, so that's a better life than he had in Ramsay Street!\\" Characterisation Being the \\"gentler\\" of the two brothers, Danny could not take Max's bullying ways, unlike his brother Shane. The constant tension between Danny and Max and Danny seemingly having a better relationship with his mother then Shane, led Andrew Mercado to question whether Danny was struggling to come to terms with his sexuality in his 2004 book Super Aussie soaps. Danny would spend more time with his mother where he could be more \\"theatrical\\", Mercado also described Danny as being \\"girlie\\" and pondered whether this made Max believe that Danny was not a true Ramsay. Max believed Danny was a \\"wimp\\" and wished he would be more like Shane. When Danny found out about his real parentage, he went through an identity crisis as he felt unloved. The news split the family in half, with Danny leaving for Brisbane with his mother. Of his character, Clencie said \\"He's an interesting character to play, a bit different from all the others\\". He added that there are many different sides to Danny and that he is \\"brash and wild on the outside, but underneath quite troubled and confused\\". Clencie has also claimed that Danny was an extension of his own persona describing him as: \\"young, wild, crazy yet vulnerable and a nice kid.\\" Storylines Danny is the youngest son of Maria Ramsay (Dasha Blahova), he was born after a one-night stand between herself and Tim Duncan (Nick Carrafa). Maria let her husband Max (Francis Bell) believe Danny was his son. Max and Danny had a difficult relationship, with Max often comparing Danny to his older brother, Shane (Peter O'Brien). Danny begins having strange dreams in which he sees Shane being killed during his swimming training. Maria suggests that he visit the family physician, Dr. Lawson to work out what is causing these nightmares. Following a car crash with Bank robber Gordon Miller (Red Symons) which leaves him and Shane injured, Danny believes that the dreams were a warning. Danny and his best friend, Scott Robinson (Darius Perkins) are wrongly accused of mugging Carol Brown (Merrin Canning), when they discover her in a drunken haze after the real muggers had fled. Scott and Danny then run away from home. and end up staying with Mrs. Forbes (Gwen Plumb) on her farm after their possessions are stolen. They boys help Mrs Forbes part-time, before returning home. Both Danny and Scott fall for Maria's sister's friend, Wendy Gibson (Kylie Foster), who plays them off against each other but gets a taste of her own medicine when a man named Tim (Mark Neal) stands her up. Max and Maria's marriage collapses after the revelation that Max is not Danny's father, but Tim Duncan who Maria had a one-night stand with. Danny overhears during a conversation with Max and his French teacher, Kate Drew. When Maria prepares to leave for Hong Kong with new partner Richard Morrison (Peter Flett) in Hong Kong, Danny refuses to go with them and remains in Erinsborough. Danny and Max then work things out with Max assuring that he loves him as his own son. Danny then leaves school to become a junior teller at the Pacific Bank. Danny falls Marcie (Erif Perkins), a fellow employee and tries to impress her and works for Clive Gibbons (Geoff Paine) as a gorilla- gram. This proves to be in vain as Marcie rejects Danny. Danny's job causes further problems when it raises the ire of Max who dislikes Clive and when Danny is mistaken for a bank robber and arrested. The misunderstanding is eventually cleared up and Danny is freed. After learing Max and Maria have reunited in Queensland, Danny, deciding he has nothing left in Ramsay Street decides to get a transfer to a branch of the bank up north and leaves. Nearly twent years later, he appears in Annalise Hartman's documentary about Ramsay Street. Reception Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture gave Danny a 2 out of 5 for his contribution to Neighbours, during a feature called \\"A guide to recognising your Ramsays and Robinsons\\". She said \\"Danny was one of the original cast of Neighbours, although he didn't stay in the show for very long. He had an ongoing rivalry with brother Shane, and was good mates with Scott Robinson, but his only real storylines of note were the revelations over his paternity, and a stint working for Dr Clive Gibbons as a gorilla-o-gram\\". In her book \\"Soap opera\\", Dorothy Hobson describes Danny and his family as \\"more working class than other characters\\", also stating: \\"They had working- class jobs but were not represented as cloth cap wearing or dowdy, they were bright and modern and representative of a vibrant and working population.\\" References Neighbours characters Fictional adoptees Television characters introduced in 1985 Male characters in television ","title":"Danny Ramsay"},{"id":"5714543","title":"Soko≈Ç√≥w County"},{"id":"5714548","text":"Erisioni in 2010Erisioni () is a Georgian ensemble which performs national dances and songs of Georgia. Erisioni won global recognition thanks to the cooperation on the project \\"Georgian Legend\\" with the United States producer Jim Lowe and French stage director Pascal Jourdan. The performance included folk dances and songs telling the story and legends of Georgia. The show was unique because of the number of dancers who simultaneously perform on the stage. More than hundred female and male artists dressed in authentic Georgian national costumes were involved in the show. They shared stories through traditional dances and folk music. The performance \\"Georgian Legend\\" provides an insight into the traditional Georgian warrior culture which has preserved its uniqueness and independence for centuries. Georgian Legend was conceived in 1999 when Jim Lowe and Pascal Jourdan were working with Erisioni in Tbilisi. They decided to bring the traditional Georgian dances to the modern scene. In 2000, the first version of the show, then called The Legend of Tamar toured in the United States. American critics hailed the production as sensational, spectacular and a feast of riches for eye and ear. In 2001 and 2002, Georgian Legend debuted in Europe, with acclaimed performances in legendary Parisian venues including the Palais des Sports and the Palais des Congres. Georgian Legend also made a successful tour through France, Switzerland and Belgium in April 2002 with an audience of 150,000 and 100,000 CDs were sold in only a few months.

It was released as a CD single by Carmody and Kelly in 1993 but failed to chart. The song was co- written by Kelly and Carmody, and is based on the story of the Gurindji strike (Wave Hill walk-off) and Vincent Lingiari as part of the Indigenous people's struggle for land rights in Australia and reconciliation. Cover of Getup Mob's version of the song On 4 May 2008 a cover version by The GetUp Mob, part of the GetUp! advocacy group, peaked at #4 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) singles charts.

Background The song was co-written by Kelly and Carmody, Note: requires user to input the song titl. Note 11 Aug 2020: Search does not return anything. and is based on the story of the Gurindji Strike (also known as the Wave Hill walk-off) and in particular the role of the Gurindji leader of the strikers, Vincent Lingiari. It describes how the Gurindjis' claim to their traditional lands back from the cattle station on which they worked (owned by UK company Vesteys and called Wave Hill Station) sparked the Indigenous land rights movement. The nine-year protest won public support and eventually led to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976, which provides the basis upon which Aboriginal Australian people in the Northern Territory can claim rights to land based on traditional occupation (native title), and the power of veto over mining and development on those lands. On 16 August 1975, a small part of their land was handed back to the Gurindji people on a 30-year-lease by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, a symbolic and powerful moment in history. Evolution of the song Carmody described writing the song: It was recorded by Paul Kelly and the Messengers for their 1991 album Comedy released by Mushroom Records. Kelly included the song on his solo albums, Live, May 1992 and Songs from the South: Paul Kelly's Greatest Hits in 1997. Carmody recorded it on his 1993 album Bloodlines supplying vocals, guitar and didgeridoo, Kelly supplied vocals, guitar and harmonica, with numerous other musicians. This Carmody and Kelly version was released as a single in 1993 but did not chart. Also in 1993, an SBS television documentary, Bloodbrothers, examined Carmody and his music including this song. Kelly attributes the song's major influences to protest songs of the civil rights movement and traditional folk songs. The melody is borrowed from \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\\" by Bob Dylan, with the opening line reworked from \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\". The lyrics are posted online on the National Museum of Australia website. Other versions The song was performed on 7 July 2007 on the Australian leg of Live Earth by Kelly, Carmody, John Butler, and Missy Higgins. The song could have been considered \\"the event's anthem.\\" Rolling Stone cited the performance as a highlight, stating the \\"whole crowd sung along ‚Äì all eleven verses.\\" The GetUp Mob, organised by advocacy group GetUp!, released a version of the song on 21 April 2008. This featured elements of the apology to the Stolen Generations, made by Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, on 13 February 2008, as well as former Prime Minister Paul Keating's Redfern Speech on 10 December 1992. The track features Carmody and Kelly, as well as other prominent Australian artists (including Urthboy, Missy Higgins, Mia Dyson, Radical Son, Jane Tyrrell, Dan Sultan, Joel Wenitong and Ozi Batla). This version peaked at #4 on the ARIA singles chart after its 28 April 2008 release, and #2 on both the Australian Chart and Digital Track Chart. The video for the song was produced by ARIA winner Hackett Films, and features John Butler, Leah Purcell, Pat Dodson and Anthony Mundine. Carmody described the 2008 version: A version of the song performed by The Waifs also appears on the 2007 Kev Carmody tribute album, Cannot Buy My Soul. The song is also featured on their 2009 Live from the Union of Soul album where it is co-performed with John Butler. In November 2009 Triple J held a tribute concert for Paul Kelly in Melbourne, with John Butler, Missy Higgins and Dan Sultan performing this song. A recording from the concert, Before Too Long, was released in 2010. The song was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry in 2010. In 2013 Joan Baez, on her first Australian tour for 28 years, included it in her concerts to great applause. Kelly and Carmody performed the song together on 5 November 2014 at the public memorial service at Sydney Town Hall for former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, who is the \\"tall stranger\\" referred to in the song.

Armed Forces Entertainment hosts over 1,200 shows around the world each year, reaching over 500,000 personnel at 355 military installations. Types of talent include musicians, comedians, cheerleaders, and celebrities of sports, movies and television. Armed Forces Entertainment was founded in 1951 to provide up-and-coming American entertainment to US troops and their family members stationed overseas, with priority to remote and isolated locations, ships at sea, and contingency operations. Entertainment is provided to the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. This is different from the non-government United Service Organizations (USO), whose entertainers tend to be famous, and generally aren't sent as close to the front line. Armed Forces Entertainment is an Air Force command operation and is the single point of contact with the DoD for providing entertainment to US military personnel serving overseas. It is the lead agency in providing transportation and logistical support for the USO in bringing celebrity entertainers to troops. Armed Forces Entertainment typically showcases emerging artists but also features celebrity acts such as Kid Rock and Drew Carey. The responsible organization for overseas military entertainment has changed names and jurisdictions over its first five decades; from the United Services Organization Camp Shows to the U.S. Army's Armed Forces Professional Entertainment Office (AFPEO) and resting in 2006 with the U.S. Air Force's Armed Forces Entertainment office. However, the mission has remained constant: to provide a program of live, professional entertainment to enhance the quality of life for Armed Forces personnel. History * World War II-1941: The United Service Organizations (USO) Camp Shows program, initiated by Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt, recruited and fielded live professional entertainment for military personnel. These shows began in the US in states like Texas where there were many military bases. Units headed by appointed supervisors were organized and scheduled to entertain at the camps. Camp Shows consisted of any and all available entertainers including well-known celebrities who were recruited to entertain military personnel serving overseas. For many celebrity entertainers, this was their first time performing and traveling abroad. The USO was a private organization and the entertainers were hired and paid a salary. Camp Shows scheduling in the US was not difficult because there were many organized units of entertainers available. Overseas scheduling which was coordinated by each Service, was considered inconsistent. * 1951-1970: Before the establishment of the Department of Defense (DoD) in 1951, the Military Services agreed to provide a single point of contact for the USO. The Secretary of the Army was designated as the administrative agent for the DoD's relationship with the USO. Operational responsibility rested with the Adjutant General, then transferred to the Commander, U.S. Army Community and Family Support Center. In 1951, Service representatives were assigned to the new Armed Forces Professional Entertainment Office (AFPEO) to administer the fielding of USO Shows, provide shows where the USO Camp Shows were unavailable, and establish a regularly scheduled program. *Units consisted of celebrities, professional artists, college groups sponsored by the American Theater Association (ATA) and the All American Collegiate Talent Showcase (ACTS). The USO and DoD sent thousands of entertainers, celebrity and non- celebrity, to entertain U.S. military personnel, DoD and Department of State civilians, and their family members worldwide. By the end of the Vietnam era, virtually all of the programmed shows were non-celebrity with DoD fielding over half of the units. * 1982: The USO cancelled the non-celebrity program to concentrate on the recruitment and fielding of well-known celebrity entertainment. The DoD directed the Secretary of the Army to assume responsibility for the non-celebrity program. In June, all non-celebrity entertainment units sent abroad were participating in the Armed Forces Professional Entertainment Program overseas, nicknamed \\"DoD Overseas Shows\\". In addition to the non-celebrity program, the AFPEO continued to uphold DoD's portion of the celebrity show responsibilities with the USO. These shows were renamed \\"USO/DoD Celebrity Shows.\\" * 1989: The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) assumed operational control of the AFPEO with the Secretary of the Army remaining the Executive Agent.

Although he announced his retirement from dance in 2008, on the occasion of the publication of his first book of poetry, Laughing Mirror he subsequently continued to make dance works, including touring The Kiss Inside during April 2015. Biography Wright was born in Tuakau, South Auckland, in 1956. From 1980 to 1983 he danced with the Limbs Dance Company and choreographed a number of works on the company before travelling to New York where he danced with the Paul Taylor Company, 1983‚Äì1987 and London with DV8 Physical Theatre, 1988. Returning to New Zealand in 1989, he formed the Douglas Wright Dance Company, with which he created more than 30 major works, touring New Zealand, Australia and Europe. In the 1998 Queen's Birthday Honours, Wright was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to dance. In 2000 Wright received one of five inaugural Arts Laureate awards from the Arts Foundation of New Zealand and in 2003 he was the subject of an award-winning feature-length documentary film, Haunting Douglas, directed by Leanne Pooley for Spacific Films. With the launch of Laughing Mirror, Wright announced his retirement from dance. Subsequently, however, during 2010 he workshopped material towards a new major group work commissioned for Auckland Festival 2011, which premiered on 16 March 2011 at The Civic Theatre as rapt, and at the Hague, in the Netherlands during 2013. During 2014 and 2015, he workshopped and developed material towards The Kiss Inside a further major group work commissioned for the New Zealand Festival, which premiered on 16 April 2015 at SkyCity Theatre, Auckland before touring to Wanaka, Dunedin, and Nelson after which touring followed on the North Island of New Zealand during March 2016. During 2018, he choreographed a solo M_nod on dancer Sean MacDonald, which had its premiere in the Grey Lynn Public Library hall to an invited audience during July, and was publicly presented in Q Theatre's Vault during Tempo Dance Festival 2018. The work was commissioned by Auckland Art Gallery director Michael Lett, and a film was made of the work. Wright died 14 November 2018, aged 62, from cancer.  Published works  He wrote two volumes of semi-fiction/semi-autobiography, Ghost Dance (Penguin, 2004 ‚Äì Montana Awards Best First Book of Non-Fiction, 2004) and Terra Incognito (2006), and also hosted an inaugural one-man exhibition of his paintings and multimedia sculptures. In October 2007 a poetry collection, Laughing Mirror was published by Steele Roberts. A second collection of his poems, cactusfear was published by Steele Roberts in October 2011, and a retrospective exhibition of his work as a choreographer, based on photographs, films and writing, was held at The University of Auckland's Gus Fisher Gallery in 2012.

It opened on 15 May 1933 but it first did not have its own venue for presentations at the Belarusian Drama Theatre building until 1938. The first permanent theatre was founded in Belarus in 1933 on the basis of the Belarusian opera and ballet school, the organizer of the studio being the famous Russian Opera singer Anton Bonachich (Bonatschitsch) (ru: –ê–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –ë–æ–Ω–∞—á–∏—á).

Bizet's Carmen opened the theatre on 25 May 1933 with the title role being sung by Larisa Aleksandrovskaya. Several professional soloists and dancers were added to the troupe in the first few years at this location. Swan Lake, performed by K. Muller, was the first show on the stage of the new theatre. By 1940, Grand was added to the theatre's name to indicate its expansion. The performances by the theatre company during the \\"Decade of Belarusian Art\\" in Moscow in June 1940 was a great success which included the first Belarusian ballet, The Nightingale composed by Mikhail Kroshner, as well as other national operas such as \\"In the Dense Forest of Palesse\\", \\"The Flower of Fortune\\", and the second version of \\"Mikhas Padgorny\\". Performances continued during the war in Nizhny Novgorod, then known as Gorky until the liberation of Minsk in 1944; after that performances took place in Kovrov. Enrichment of post World War 2 repertoire and expansion During this time the repertoire was greatly enriched. The most famous operas staged in this theatre include Boris Godunov by Modest Mussorgsky, Otello and Don Carlo by Giuseppe Verdi, Jacques Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann, Sadko and The Golden Cockerel by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and Lohengrin by Richard Wagner.

But who was Bing?, Oregon Progress, Oregon State University Agricultural Experiment Station, Fall 2009. Ah Bing was reportedly born in China and immigrated to the U.S. in about 1855. He worked as a foreman in the Lewelling family fruit orchards in Milwaukie for about 35 years, supervising other workers and caring for trees. He went back to China in 1889 for a visit.

Distribution The common woodlouse is the most widespread species of woodlouse in the British Isles, both geographically and ecologically. accessed through the NERC Open Access Research Archive (NORA) It is not known from the Mediterranean Basin, but is widespread in Northern and Western Europe, as far east as Ukraine, as well as in the Azores and Madeira; it has also been widely introduced in the Americas. Ecology The common woodlouse occurs in a wide range of habitats, including some with little available calcium. It is chiefly found under stones, and on rotting wood. It is the only woodlouse regularly found on heather moors and blanket bogs, where it lives around items such as rotting fenceposts. Description The common woodlouse is one of the largest native woodlice in Britain, at up to long. It is relatively flat, and is a shiny brown/grey in colour, although juveniles are rougher. Pale patches are often visible on the back of Oniscus asellus; these are areas that store calcium, which is then used to reinforce the exoskeleton after a moult.

At the time, the Production Code, also known as the Hays Code, banned any explicit references to or attempts to justify adultery and illicit sex. The comedy of remarriage enabled filmmakers to evade this provision of the Code. The protagonists divorced, flirted with strangers without risking the wrath of censorship, and then got back together. The genre was given its name by the philosopher Stanley Cavell in a series of academic articles that later became a book, Pursuits of Happiness: The Hollywood Comedy of Remarriage. Cavell argues that the genre represented Hollywood's crowning achievement, and that beneath all the slapstick and innuendo is a serious effort to create a new basis for marriage centered on mutual love - religious and economic necessity no longer applying for much of the American middle class. In response to Cavell's article, scholar David R. Shumway claims it is possible \\"to make too much of the remarriage 'genre'. He points out that \\"only two of Cavell's seven comedies deal with characters who we actually see interacting as husband and wife for any length of time\\" and points out that all seven films fit into the screwball comedy genre. More recently, film critics A. O. Scott and David Edelstein both argued that Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was a 21st-century example of the genre.Edelstein, David. \\"Forget Me Not: The genius of Charlie Kaufman's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\".

Praljak was found guilty of committing violations of the laws of war, crimes against humanity and breaches of the Geneva Conventions during the Croat‚ÄìBosniak War by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 2017. Praljak voluntarily joined the newly formed Croatian Armed Forces after the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence in 1991. Before and after the war he was an engineer, a television and theatre director, as well as a businessman. Praljak was indicted by, and voluntarily surrendered to, the ICTY in 2004. In 2013, he was convicted for war crimes against the Bosniak population during the Croat‚ÄìBosniak War alongside five other Bosnian Croat officials, and was sentenced to 20 years in jail (minus the time he had already spent in detention). Upon hearing the guilty verdict upheld in November 2017, Praljak stated that he rejected the verdict of the court, and committed suicide by poisoning in the courtroom.  Early life and career  Slobodan Praljak was born on 2 January 1945 in ƒåapljina, Yugoslavia. His father Mirko worked for the security agency OZNA. Praljak attended high school in ≈†iroki Brijeg with the future Croatian Defense Minister Gojko ≈†u≈°ak. He had three university degrees. In 1970, he graduated as an electrical engineer at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Zagreb with a GPA of 4.5/5. In 1971, he graduated from the Zagreb Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, majoring in philosophy and sociology. In 1972, he graduated from the Zagreb Academy of Dramatic Art. At first, Praljak worked as a professor and manager of the electronics laboratory at the Nikola Tesla Vocational High School in Zagreb, then lectured on philosophy and sociology, and after 1973 was a freelance artist. Praljak was also a theatre director in theatres in Zagreb, Osijek and Mostar. He directed the television series Blesan i Tulipan [Blesan and Tulipan], television dramas Novela od Stanca and Sarga≈°ko more [Sargasso Sea], documentaries Smrt psa (1980) [Death of a Dog], Sand≈æak and Duhan [Tobacco] (both in 1990), and film Povratak Katarine Ko≈æul (1989) [Return of Katarina Ko≈æul].  Military activity during the Croatian War of Independence and Croat‚ÄìBosniak War  Praljak drew public attention in September 1991 when he voluntarily joined the newly formed Croatian Armed Forces after the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence. He formed a unit composed of the Zagreb artists and intellectuals with whom he held positions in Sunja. After the Sarajevo Agreement, by 3 April 1992, he was made major general, received a number of responsibilities in the Ministry of Defence, and became one of the 14 members of the Croatian National Defence Council and a member of the Croatian State Commission for Relations with United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). He was the High Representative of the Ministry of Defence, and since 13 May 1993, representative of the Ministry of Defence in the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia and Croatian Defence Council (HVO). Praljak petitioned Alija Izetbegoviƒá to unblock Sarajevo but his propositions were rejected. From 24 July to 8 November 1993, Praljak was the Chief of Staff of the Croatian Defence Council. In spite of the Croat-Muslim conflict in the Croat‚ÄìBosniak War, he sent a truck full of weapons to besieged Sarajevo to help Bosniaks. He also allowed the UNHCR's humanitarian convoy through to Mostar, which was stopped in ƒåitluk. Praljak was accused of failing to prevent the armed forces from committing many crimes of which he was informed and that he could foresee, including removing and placing in detention the Muslim population of Prozor from July through August 1993, murders in Mostar municipality, the destruction of buildings in East Mostar (including the mosques and the Stari Most), attacking and wounding of members of international organisations, the destruction and looting of property in Gornji Vakuf in January 1993, Ra≈°tani in August 1993, and Stupni Do in October 1993. During 1993, General Praljak was in charge of the Dretelj camp where Bosniak men were brutalized, starved, and some killed. Praljak was accused of ordering the destruction of Mostar's Stari Most in November 1993, an act which ICTY ruled had \\"caused disproportionate damage to the Muslim civilian population\\". However, ICTY agreed that the bridge was a legitimate military target. During the trial, Praljak denied the accusation because in the same month when the destruction occurred, he came into conflict with the commander of the HVO's so-called Punishment Battalion Mladen Naletiliƒá Tuta which resulted in his resignation from the positions of HVO's Chief of Staff, one day before the destruction of the bridge. He said that the bridge was demolished by activation of the explosive charge set on the left bank of the Neretva, where the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina was located. In addition to the responsibility and whether it was a legitimate military target, ICTY also examined whether the earlier siege by JNA and Bosnian Serb forces contributed to the bridge's collapse. Praljak retired from military service at his own request on 1 December 1995.  Postwar career  After the war, Praljak became a businessman. In 1995, Praljak co-founded a company with his brother Zoran called Oktavijan. His company initially produced films, video, and television programs and published Praljak‚Äôs books. It later engaged in real estate business by managing a business complex Centar 2000 in Zagreb. Since 2005, the company is owned and managed by his stepson Nikola Babiƒá Praljak. In 2011 it had around 22 million kunas of revenue. Praljak was also a co-owner of Liberan, a company that has a share in Ljubu≈°ki Tobacco Factory, and owned other shares in few other companies. In 2008, the Croatian Ministry of Culture deemed that 18 of his works about the Croatian War of Independence, Bosnian War, and relations between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina were not books but brochures of worthless literature, and in 2013 the Ministry of Finance made an enforcement charge of 435 thousand kunas. In total, he authored 25 works. Since 2012, The Hague Tribunal's secretariat requested Praljak to recover defence costs of around EUR 2.8-3.3 million, as they estimated that he had assets and shares worth EUR 6.5 million which allowed him to fund the costs of his defence. Praljak and his lawyer refused the estimation statement because he had no property in his name even from the beginning of the trial.  ICTY indictment  Praljak was among six accused by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), in relation to the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia. On 5 April 2004, he voluntarily surrendered and was transferred to the ICTY. In his indictment it was alleged that Praljak as a senior military official commanded, directly and indirectly, the Herceg-Bosna/HVO armed forces which committed mass war crimes against Bosnian Muslim population in 8 municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina during a joint criminal enterprise between 1992 and 1994. In his role as a high- ranking official in the Ministry of Defence, he was closely involved in all aspects of not only the Herceg-Bosna/HVO military planning and operations but the actions of the Herceg-Bosna/HVO civilian police too. On 6 April, he appeared before ICTY and pleaded not guilty. He chose to defend himself without a lawyer. The indictment charged on the basis of their individual and superior criminal responsibility, but subsequently in judgment only on the basis of individual criminal responsibility. Praljak was found guilty on (taken from the UN press release 2004, 2017): The trial began on 26 April 2006. On 29 May 2013 the Trial Chamber judgement sentenced him to 20 years of imprisonment (the sentence took into account the time he had already spent in detention), and on 28 June 2013, Praljak filed an appeal. On 29 November 2017, the ICTY trial was concluded finding him guilty, and although some parts of his conviction were overturned, the judge did not reduce the initial sentence of 20 years. He was charged with crimes against \\"humanity, violations of the laws or customs of war, and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions\\", also \\"extensive appropriation of property not justified by military necessity\\" and \\"plunder of public or private property through the third category of joint criminal enterprise liability\\", on which given his command responsibility he failed to act and prevent. He was acquitted of some charges related to the destruction of Stari Most. As he had already served more than two-thirds of the sentence in jail (around 13 years and several months), he would probably have been released soon.  Death  On 29 November 2017, during the pronouncement of the appeal judgment against him, Praljak addressed the judges, saying: \\"Judges, Slobodan Praljak is not a war criminal. With disdain, I reject your verdict!\\" He then drank what he said was poison, leading presiding judge Carmel Agius to suspend the hearings. ICTY medical staff transported Praljak to nearby HMC Hospital, where he died. The Dutch authorities declared the courtroom a crime scene and launched an investigation. His body was cremated in Zagreb in a private ceremony. = Reaction = Former ICTY judges Wolfgang Schomburg and Richard Goldstone commented that \\"it is a tragedy that someone in such a situation has taken their own life\\". Goldstone added: \\"In a way, the victims are deprived of this deed. They did not get full justice.\\" Martin Bell described Praljak as a \\"theatrical character\\" who \\"died in a theatrical way\\". Andrey Shary for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty noted that \\"Praljak's samurai final act might evoke respect or sympathy\\", but \\"individual perceptions of honor don't always coincide with correctness\\". Writing in The Daily Telegraph, journalist Harry de Quetteville opined that the defiant suicide was \\"the most dramatic proof possible of a very uncomfortable reality: many in the Balkans refuse to accept that the horrific ethnic cleansing of the 1990s was wrong\\". Former US Ambassador for War Crimes Issues Stephen Rapp compared Praljak's suicide by poisoning to that of another war crimes convict, Hermann G√∂ring, noting that in both cases the verdict nevertheless \\"stands for all history in establishing the facts and in showing that the perpetrators of atrocities will be held to account\\".  Regional reaction  The Croatian government offered condolences to Praljak's family and said the ICTY misrepresented its officials in the 1990s. Prime Minister Andrej Plenkoviƒá stated that Praljak's suicide illustrated the \\"deep moral injustice towards the six Croats from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian people\\". All the party caucuses of the Croatian Parliament except the SDP and GLAS issued a joint statement declaring that ICTY's verdict did not respect the \\"historical truths, facts and evidence\\", and that it was \\"unjust and unacceptable\\", adding that Praljak symbolically warned of all the verdicts' injustice with his suicide. They expressed their condolences to the families of victims of crimes committed during the Bosnian War. Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitaroviƒá expressed her condolences to Praljak's family, calling him \\"a man who preferred to die rather than live as a convict for crimes he did not commit\\". Miroslav Tuƒëman stated it was a \\"consequence of his moral position not to accept the verdict that has nothing to do with justice or reality\\". The Bosniak member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bakir Izetbegoviƒá, said that Praljak was led to suicide by the joint criminal enterprise, while Croat Chairman Dragan ƒåoviƒá stated that Praljak had sacrificed his life to prove his innocence. Serbian President Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá said he would not mock Praljak's suicide but has criticized the reaction of Croatian officials, stating that it would have been unacceptable for him to praise a convicted war criminal as a hero or to denounce an ICTY verdict. The Serbian politician Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj commented that, although he was an enemy, it was a \\"heroic move worthy of respect\\" and there should have been more such strong blows to the tribunal. Almost a thousand Bosnian Croats gathered in the Mostar and ƒåapljina squares to light candles to pay respect to Praljak. On December 11, 2017, a commemoration for Slobodan Praljak was held in Zagreb. The event was attended by two thousand people, including Government ministers Damir Krstiƒçeviƒá and Tomo Medved (as private citizens), a number of MPs, mostly from the Croatian Democratic Union party, and some retired army officers that participated in the 1990s war. In the evening, a religious ceremony was also held at a Catholic church. During the same day, members of the Youth Initiative for Human Rights made a commemoration for the victims of Croatian forces urging condemnation of that period policies. President Grabar-Kitaroviƒá has been pressured to take away wartime decorations from Praljak and other convicted officials, but she refused to do so stating that they received it for defence against Serbian aggression, adding that \\"such practice has not been implemented so far, except in the case of verdicts made by the Croatian courts\\". = Investigation = A preliminary autopsy determined that Praljak had poisoned himself with potassium cyanide, which caused his heart to fail. How the poison was obtained and brought into the courtroom is to be the subject of an official investigation. Praljak's lawyer Nika Pinter suggested that he may have committed suicide because he could not accept being convicted as a war criminal and that the act had been long-planned. The cyanide that Praljak took was not listed as a prohibited substance under Dutch law. ‚ÄúWith regards to the investigation concerning assistance in the commission of suicide, the Dutch authorities conducted a thorough investigation of how Praljak could get ahold of the cyanide. Witnesses were interviewed, video materials watched, rooms in which Praljak stayed were checked and numerous materials inspected. However, no information was found concerning the question on how Praljak came into possession of that substance,‚Äù the prosecutors‚Äô report said. The report added that video surveillance recordings did not show if Praljak carried the vial of poison with him or if it was handed to him.

The earliest manuscript of the document is of the fourteenth century, so some historians believe it is likely a forgery. The document titled Pacta conventa or Qualiter (the first word in the document) was found in a Trogir library. Until the 19th century it was considered that it dated to 1102. However, historians today hold that it is not an authentic document from 1102 and likely a forgery from the 14th century, but that the contents of the Pacta Conventa still correspond to the political situation of that time in Croatia.P√°l Engel: Realm of St. Stephen: A History of Medieval Hungary, 2005, p. 35-36B√°r√°ny, Attila (2012). \\"The Expansion of the Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages (1000‚Äì 1490)\\". In Berend, N√≥ra. The Expansion of Central Europe in the Middle Ages. Ashgate Variorum. page 344-345 The document is preserved in the Hungarian National Museum in Budapest.Eduard Hercigonja, Tropismena i trojeziƒçna kultura hrvatskoga srednjovjekovlja, Matica hrvatska, Zagreb, 2006. Background After Petar Svaƒçiƒá, the last Croatian king of Croat descent, was killed on the battlefield in 1097, the Croats had refused to surrender.Hrvoje Hitrec; Hrvatska povjesnica; in Croatian To end the war, an agreement was made, probably in 1102. The Croatian nobles allegedly concluded the Pacta conventa with King Coloman before his crowning as the Croatian king in Biograd.Curta, Stephenson, 2006, p. 267 The Hungarian king offered \\"an agreement as pleases them\\" to the twelve noble Croatian tribes from the families of ƒåudomiriƒá, Gusiƒá, Kaƒçiƒá, Kukar, Jamomet, Lasniƒçiƒá, Lapƒçan and Karinjan, Mogoroviƒá, Poletƒçiƒá, Snaƒçiƒá, ≈†ubiƒá, and Tugomiriƒá. Terms The agreement determined that the Croatian nobles who signed the document with King Coloman would retain their possessions and properties without interference. It also granted the mentioned families exemption from tax or tributes to the king. Each of the twelve noble Croatian tribes were obliged to answer the king's call if someone attacked his borders and send at least ten armed horsemen to war, as far as the Drava River (Croatia's northern boundary with Hungary) at their own expense. Beyond that point, the Hungarian king paid the expenses.Jean W. Sedlar: East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000‚Äì1500, University of Washington Press, 2011, p. 77. Trpimir Macan: Povijest hrvatskog naroda, 1971, p. 71 (full text of Pacta conventa in Croatian)Ferdo ≈†i≈°iƒá: Priruƒçnik izvora hrvatske historije, Dio 1, ƒçest 1, do god. 1107., Zagreb 1914., p. 527-528 (full text of Pacta conventa in Latin) Validity of the document itself The document's validity is questionable. While some claim the earliest text concerning the alleged agreement came from the second half of the 14th century others call it a late medieval forgery, not a twelfth-century source. While various items of the text seem anachronistic to some, other historians say these could be reworkings of a text from an actual agreement. Since the 19th century, a number of historians have claimed that the Pacta conventa was not a genuine document. In 1915 and then also in 1925, Milan ≈†ufflay mentioned the document in some of his works, first declaring it an outright forgery, and later saying it was a 14th-century \\"addendum\\" to the manuscript of Thomas the Archdeacon. Hungarian historian J√°nos Kar√°csonyi thought it was a 14th-century forgery, Slovene historian Ljudmil Hauptmann dated the document to the 13th century, Croatian historians Miho Barada and Marko Kostrenƒçiƒá thought it was made in 1102, while later Croatian historian Nada Klaiƒá thought it was a forgery probably made in the 14th century. Croatian historian Stjepan Antoljak in turn said the Pacta was an incomplete historical source, but not a forgery. Nada Klaiƒá elaborated her \\"lack of opinion\\" over the matter of 1102 in a 1959 article disputing the Croatian writer Oleg Mandiƒá's earlier work on the matter. The dispute and uncertainty over the Pacta conventa matches the overall uncertainty and dispute over the relationship between the Croatian and Hungarian kingdoms in the 10th and 11th century, with Croatian historian Ferdo ≈†i≈°iƒá and his followers assuming Tomislav of Croatia had ruled most of the area inhabited by Croats, including Slavonia, while the Hungarian historians Gyula Krist√≥, B√°lint H√≥man and J√°nos Kar√°csonyi thought the area between Drava and Sava belonged neither to Croatia nor to Hungary at the time, an opinion that Nada Klaiƒá said she would not preclude, because the generic name \\"Slavonia\\" (lit. the land of the Slavs) may have implied so. Though the validity of the document is disputed, there was at least a non-written agreement that regulated the relations between Hungary and Croatia in approximately the same way, since from 1102 until 1918 kings of Hungary were also kings of Croatia, represented by a governor (ban), but Croatia kept its own parliament (Sabor) and considerable autonomy. The source of inspiration for the text of the document must have been the political and social developments that had taken place over a 300-year period following 1102 when the two kingdoms united under the Hungarian king, either by the choice of the Croat nobility or by Hungarian force. The Croatian nobility retained its laws and privileges including the restriction of military service that they owed to the king within the boundaries of Croatia. Interpretations of the agreement According to the Library of Congress country study on the former Yugoslavia, King Coloman crushed opposition after the death of Ladislaus I of Hungary and won the crown of Dalmatia and Croatia in 1102. The crowning of Coloman forged a link between the Croatian and Hungarian crowns that lasted until the end of World War I. Croatians have maintained for centuries that Croatia remained a sovereign state despite the voluntary union of the two crowns. A number of Hungarian historians also accept the view that Croatia and Hungary entered in a personal union in 1102B√°r√°ny, Attila (2012). \\"The Expansion of the Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages (1000‚Äì 1490)\\".

However, some Hungarian and Serbian historians claim that Hungary annexed Croatia outright in 1102. According to Frederick Bernard Singleton, the Croatians have always maintained that they were never legally part of Hungary. In the eyes of Croatians, Croatia was a separate state which happened to share a ruler with the Hungarians. The degree of Croatian autonomy fluctuated from time to time, as well as its borders. According to Daniel Power, Croatia became part of Hungary in the late 11th and early twelfth century. According to the country study on Hungary Croatia was never assimilated into Hungary; rather, it became an associate kingdom administered by a ban, or civil governor.Stephen R. Burant, ed. Hungary: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1989 In either case, Hungarian culture permeated Croatia, the Croatian- Hungarian border shifted often, and at times Hungary treated Croatia as a vassal state. In 1105 Coloman granted privileges to maritime cities in exchange for their submission. These included the election of their own bishops and priors which is later only confirmed by the king, prohibition of Hungarians settling in towns. Also, the cities did not pay tribute, while royal agents supervised the collection of custom duties without interfering in local politics.Curta, Stephenson, 2006, p. 266 While Croatian historian Nada Klaiƒá thinks that some sort of surrender occurred in 1102, giving the Croatians light terms, Slovenian historians Matja≈æ Klemenƒçiƒç and Mitja ≈Ωagar believe the Pacta Conventa never actually existed, but the story about it was important to support the Croatian position later in the Habsburg Monarchy of rights on the basis of that agreement. Klemenƒçiƒç and ≈Ωagar think that although Croatia ceased to exist as an independent state, the Croatian nobility retained relatively strong powers. Klaiƒá thinks that the Trogir manuscript, the earliest text of the alleged pact, is not the text of that surrender, but describes contemporary relations between king and nobility and then traced that current 14th century reality back to an initial agreement. Later references After the death of King Louis II at the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526, the Croatian parliament met at Cetin and elected Ferdinand of Austria king of Croatia. According to the Croatian historical narrative, the Croatian parliament took the opportunity in 1526 to reassert its autonomy from Hungary with the election of Ferdinand by the words:\\"...we joined the Holy Crown of Hungary by our own free will just as we do now, the rule of Your Majesty\\". Croatian historians also argue that the struggle for ascendancy to the Habsburg throne at this time provides evidence of Croatia's political autonomy. In the Croatian legal interpretation of the personal union, Louis II didn't leave any heirs and the legal carrier of the union (the king) didn't exist anymore so the right to elect the king belonged once more to the Croatian nobility. Unlike Hungarian historians, the Austrians never claimed they conquered Croatia by force and there appears to be little reason to doubt Croatian claims about the events of 1526. The intro of The Hungaro-Croatian Compromise of 1868 (the Nagodba) starts as: \\"Since Croatia and Slavonia have alike de jure and de facto belonged for centuries to the Crown of St. Stephen...\\"http://www.h-net.org/~habsweb/sourcetexts/nagodba1.htm The Hungaro- Croatian Compromise of 1868 Although the Nagodba provided a measure of political autonomy to Croatia-Slavonia, it was subordinated politically and economically to Budapest.

It takes its name from the approximate outline of the palace walls which were shaped like a crescent moon. Banwolseong has been also known as Sinwolseong or Jaeseong, which means where the king resides. Features Today the ruins of the palace, set among lush forests and hills, can still be visited and is part of the Gyeongju Historic Areas, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The South Korean government has also designated the palace ruins as Historic Site No. 16. Other notable sites nearby include the Anapji Pond which is northwest of the ruins and Gyeongju National Museum. The fortress was built by King Pasa (4-24) to protect the royal palace. The palace had many structures including the north and south gates, Guijeongmun, Hyeondeokmun, Mupyeongmun, Wolsangnu pavilion, Mangeunnu, and Goru. Jowonjeon was where the governmental affairs were discussed. Namcheon River flows along the south wall and provided a natural barrier of protection. The site of Imhaejeon Hall and other structures were also near the river. According to legend, a man named Hogon lived on the site of the future fortress and was chased away by a youth Talhae who had magical powers. King Namhae, impressed by the story, took Talhae as his son-in-law. Talhae eventually became king. Treasure No. 66, Seokbinggo, is a famous icehouse. It is 2.4 meters in width, 1.78 meters in height, and 18.8 meters in length. The entrance is located in the south and three ventilation ducts were built in the arched roof. The floor is angled in an incline so that melting ice water flows toward the floor. Originally the ice storehouse was in the west of Wolseong but has been moved to its present location near the northern castle turret. The icehouse was used during the Joseon Dynasty. Records inscribed on stone state that Jo Myeonggyeom replaced the older wood ice storage house with one made of stone during the reign of King Yeongjo and then moved the icehouse to the west of Wolseong. The storage facility is considered important for its architectural technique and the magnitude of the structure. The oldest icehouse in Korea was built in 505 under the reign of King Jijeung.

Premise Hyde Pierce, acting out the role of an alien (credited as \\"infinity-cubed\\" in the opening credits), narrates a courtship in a late 20th-century American city, presenting findings and opinions as an extraterrestrial nature documentary. The relationship \\"footage\\" is played straight, while the voice-over (with its most often wildly inaccurate theories) and elaborate visual metaphors add comedy. Among other themes the film explores the possibility that, whenever describing their interpretations of other species' acts and feelings, humans may get everything wrong. Plot Billy, a shy young man looking for a date, meets the beautiful Jenny Smith at a nightclub. They enter a relationship where Billy is bashful to tell Jenny that he loves her due to fear of being \\"trapped\\", and both paramours receive advice from their respective friends. The couple engage in sexual encounters while using barrier devices; during these encounters Billy is unable to reveal to Jenny his affection. Then, one year after their first meeting, Billy and Jenny decide to take a vacation, and (hastily) sleep together without condoms or diaphragms. Soon after, Jenny discovers that she is pregnant, and argues with Billy, who accuses her of trapping him into marriage. The couple take bad consultations from their coworkers. Eventually, Jenny decides to go to a clinic to abort her unwanted child. Billy comes to his senses and stops her from doing so, resulting in the two confessing their love for one another. The film ends with Billy and Jenny getting happily married and celebrating the birth of their child.

Early life and education  Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the second of four daughters, Holabird grew up in an artistic home in Chicago, and her family spent many summers in Michigan. In 1969, she received a B.A. in literature from Bennington College in Vermont and then worked at Bennington College as a literary editor for a year after her graduation. Career  Holabird then found herself in Italy as a freelance journalist where she met her husband, Michael Haggiag. The two married in 1974 and moved to London, where she continued to write and worked at a nursery school. She has two daughters, Tara and Alexandra. Later, Holabird met Helen Craig, a London photographer and artist whose illustrations have been inspired by her childhood in rural England. Over the next few years, Craig illustrated several mini-books with mice, and Holabird provided some of the text. In 1983, her third child, Adam, was born. In 1983, Holabird's first children's book, Angelina Ballerina, was published. Her son Adam was her inspiration for the character Henry, and Angelina's character was inspired by her daughters' love for dressing up and dancing. Holabird wrote the first draft of Angelina Ballerina at the kitchen table with her daughters dancing around her. In fact, the Angelina books were originally about a girl, but then Craig drew a mouse, and Holabird loved it. \\"The impulsive character of Angelina came alive,\\" says Holabird, \\"and seemed to pirouette off the page with enthusiasm and energy, while her plump and ebullient body expressed drama and attitude in every twitch of her tail.\\" Angelina is a very emotional character; she is sensitive and often bursts into tears right before offering an apology. She struggles with her conscience but always ends up doing the right thing‚Äîwhich is very familiar to many young children. The universal childhood themes in Angelina include friendship, jealousy, loyalty, & dedication. As a child, she was an avid reader who loved fairy tales and stories about heroic animals, and she frequently saw ballets like Cinderella and Swan Lake with her grandmother. The young, imaginative Holabird loved animals, playing in her tree house, and dancing with her sisters. When reflecting on her childhood, she said: \\"TV hadn't become a fixture in every home, and we created our own imaginative world.\\" She graduated high school from the Francis Parker School in realistically portray the difficulties of growing up. According to Holabird, it is a ballerina book for \\"all the passionate little dancers and performers in the world,\\" including her own two daughters, which is why she \\"decided to explore the impulsive, highly emotional character of a small but determined ballerina.\\" The first American edition of Angelina Ballerina was published in 1984. A year later, Holabird received the Kentucky Bluegrass Award for Angelina Ballerina. In 1986 and 1987, she received the ALA Notable Book Awards. Angelina's Christmas was selected as Child Study Association's Children's Book of the Year in 1987. The following year, Holabird and Craig published Alexander and the Dragon, their first Alexander book, aimed at preschool children who want to be consoled about bedtime monsters. In 1990, Holabird wrote the Alexander sequel, Alexander and the Magic Boat, which portrays a strong mother/son relationship while the two go on a voyage to imaginary worlds. Also in 1990, Holabird received the British Book Design and Production award. In 1999, HIT Entertainment in London (known for Thomas the Tank Engine, Bob the Builder, and Barney) secured the rights for Angelina Ballerina and commissioned Grand Slamm Children's Films to make an animated TV pilot. HIT also developed a lot of Angelina merchandise. Angelina made her worldwide television debut in 2001 on CITV in the United Kingdom. Actress Finty Williams is the voice of Angelina, and her mother, Judi Dench, is Miss Lilly. In 2002, the Angelina series premiered on PBS Kids TV in the United States. Angelina Ballerina's Invitation to the Ballet received the prestigious Oppenheim Platinum Award in the U.S. in 2004. That same year, Angelina was named the official spokesperson of National Dance Week in the United States. In 2005, Angelina made her debut on PBS Kids Sprout, a 24-hour digital television channel for preschoolers in the U.S. Holabird was honored in 2006 with an invitation to Queen Elizabeth's 80th birthday party at Buckingham Palace. That same year, the entire series of Angelina books was reissued by Grosset and Dunlap in the United States. Also in 2006, The Angelina Ballerina Dance Academy debuted with special Angelina ballet classes across England. Angelina's Star Performance, an original ballet based on Angelina at the Palace, debuted in 2007 in London with the English National Ballet. Holabird is hoping to release a new theatrical pop-up Angelina book in 2008. Together, Holabird and Craig have now published a total of ten Angelina books and two Alexander books. Overall, the Angelina books have been translated into more than 20 languages. Holabird speaks English, French, Italian, and a bit of Spanish. Her favorite books are Charlotte's Web, Black Beauty, and the Harry Potter series. She writes in a blue room with a scenic view upstairs in her London home, and it usually takes her six to eight weeks to write an Angelina book. After that, each book goes to Helen Craig for at least three months to be illustrated; then it goes to the publisher and is usually published nine months later. Her most recent work, Twinkle, is about a child fairy that goes to the Fairy School for Music and Magic.

Latimeria chalumnae is a crossopterygian. The fish was first discovered around the Comoro Islands, Madagascar, and Mozambique in the western Indian Ocean. This coelacanth was once thought to be evolutionarily conservative, but discoveries have shown there to be initial morphological diversity. It has a vivid blue pigment, and is the better known of the two extant species. The species has been assessed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List.  Anatomy and Physiology  Latimeria chalumnae model in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History The average weight of Latimeria chalumnae is 80 kg (176 lb), and they can reach up to 2 m (6.5 ft) in length. Adult females are slightly larger than males. Latimeria chalumnae exhibit a deep royal blue color with spots used as a camouflage tactic for hunting prey. Similar anatomical adaptations include the abundance of visual cells such as rods to help see when light is limited. This combined with the West Indian Ocean coelacanth's large eyes aid seeing in dark water. Similar to cartilaginous fish, Latimeria chalumnae has a rectal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, and spinal cord. To balance osmotic pressure, these fish adopt an efficient mechanism of osmoregulation by retaining urea in their blood. Latimeria chalumnae is ovoviviparous fish that retain their eggs internally until they hatch. They also have low fecundity due to their long gestation period, around 12 months, though not much is known about their age of sexual maturity.  Habitat and Behavior  L. chalumnae are often found between depth, but are sometimes found as deep as . L. chalumnae resides in underwater caves at these depths, which may limit their maximum depth range, along with lack of prey. They are known to spend the daytime within theses lava caves, likely for protection from predators, and use the surrounding feeding grounds at night. Some individuals have been seen performing \\"headstands\\" as feeding behavior, allowing coelacanth to slurp prey from crevices within lava caves. This behavior is made possible due to the coelacanth's ability to move both its upper and lower jaw, which is a unique trait in extant vertebrates. Population and conservation L. chalumnae is widely but very sparsely distributed around the rim of the western Indian Ocean, from South Africa northward along the east African coast to Kenya, the Comoros and Madagascar, seemingly occurring in small colonies. In 1991, it was estimated that 2-5 coelacanths were accidentally caught each year from Grand Camoro, making up about 1% of its population. Between 1991 and 1994, there was an estimated 30% total population reduction of the coelacanth. In 1998, the total population of the West Indian Ocean coelacanth was estimated to have been 500 or fewer, a number that would threaten the survival of the species. Near Grand Comoro, an island northwest of Madagascar, a maximum of 370 individuals reside. L. chalumnae is listed as critically endangered by IUCN. In accordance with the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species treaty, the coelacanth was added to Appendix I (threatened with extinction) in 1989. The treaty forbids international trade for commercial purposes and regulates all trade, including sending specimens to museums, through a system of permits.  Discovery  =First discovery in South Africa= Natural History Museum, Vienna, Austria [length: - weight: ]. This specimen was caught on 18 October 1974, next to Salimani/Selimani (Grand Comoro, Comoro Islands) . On December 23, 1938, Hendrik Goosen, the captain of the trawler Nerine, returned to the harbour at East London, South Africa, after a trawl between the Chalumna and Ncera Rivers. The Latimeria chalumnae was inhabiting the slopes of Grande Comore and Anjouan islands at depths between . As he frequently did, he telephoned his friend, Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, curator at East London Museum, to see if she wanted to look over the contents of the catch for anything interesting, and told her of the strange fish he had set aside for her. Correspondence in the archives of the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (SAIAB, formerly the JLB Smith Institute of Ichthyology) show that Goosen went to great lengths to avoid any damage to this fish and ordered his crew to set it aside for the East London Museum. Goosen later told how the fish was steely blue when first seen but by the time the Nerine entered East London harbour many hours later the fish had become dark grey. Failing to find a description of the creature in any of her books, she attempted to contact her friend, Professor J. L. B. Smith, but he was away for Christmas. Unable to preserve the fish, she reluctantly sent it to a taxidermist. When Smith returned, he immediately recognized it as a coelacanth, known only from fossils. Smith named the fish Latimeria chalumnae in honor of Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer and the waters in which it was found. The two discoverers received immediate recognition, and the fish became known as a \\"living fossil\\". The 1938 coelacanth is still on display in the East London, South Africa, museum. However, as the specimen had been stuffed, the gills and skeleton were not available for examination, and some doubt therefore remained as to whether it was truly the same species. Smith began a hunt for a second specimen that would take more than a decade. =The second specimen, Malania anjouanae= A second specimen with a missing dorsal fin and deformed tail fin was captured in 1952 off the coast of Anjouan. At the time it was believed to be a new species and placed in a new genus as well, Malania, named in honour of the Prime Minister of South Africa at the time, Daniel Fran√ßois Malan, without whose help the specimen would not have been preserved with its muscles and internal organs more or less intact.  Taxonomy  The West Indian Ocean coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) comes from the genus Latimeria, where it shares one other species within its genus. The other species is the Indonesian coelacanth (Latimeria menadoensis). From September 1997-July 1998, two coelacanth fish were discovered off the coast of Manado Tua Island, Sulawesi, Indonesia, different from the Latimeria chalumnae discovered near the Comores. The Indonesian coelacanth is identifiable by its grey color. Genetics The genome of Latimeria chalumnae was sequenced in 2013 to provide insight into tetrapod evolution. The coelacanth was long believed to be the closest relative to the first tetrapods on land due to its body characteristics. However, genetic sequencing proved that the lungfish is in fact the closest relative to land tetrapods. The full sequence and annotation of the entry is available on the Ensembl genome browser.

The group was created by its founding director Kristina Boerger in 1990. The AMASONG choral group is a highly trained chorus of about 60 women who perform women-oriented, folkloric and classical music. Foundation In 1990, a year before beginning her master's degree in choral conducting at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, Kristina Boerger decided to form what she advertised as a lesbian/feminist chorus called AMASONG. The group's name is a portmanteau on the words amazon and song. Boerger said, \\"The word amazon conjures up images of strong women who make their own decisions. It was a way of coding our group in a certain way.\\" Boerger posted flyers around town about her new choral group, AMASONG. Many local women responded to the flyers. A roomful of women showed up at the first choir rehearsal, consisting mainly of lesbians, feminist housewives and students. Boerger said that the decision to label AMASONG as lesbian/feminist was important. In the PBS documentary produced by Jay Rosenstein, entitled, The AMASONG Chorus: Singing Out, Boerger explained, \\"There's lesbian-feminism with a hyphen, which refers to woman who are lesbian and feminist. But if you put a diagonal slash between, then it means either or. And that's very important. Whenever I tell people on the phone who we are, I make sure they get the punctuation correct. It doesn't mean you have to be both to get in the choir. It means you've got to be one or the other.\\" The choir's first members were diverse in interest, age and experience. Music genre AMASONG's repertoire is heavily inspired by folk music from various global cultural traditions, music written by women, and other genres of music reflecting women's life experiences. Leadership AMASONG records and performs regularly. It is now under the direction of choir director, Jill Crandall. Past directors include Meagan Johnson, Esther Gille, Margot Rejskind, and Deborah Skydell. Founding director Kristina Boerger stepped down from her position as choir director and relocated to New York City in 2000. New York was her performance and teaching base until 2009. She is currently Director of University Choirs at the DePauw School of Music, where her Chamber Singers have performed by invitation at the White House. She has lectured in music history at Barnard College and taught choral conducting at the Manhattan School of Music. Each summer Boerger joins the faculty of the Madison Early Music Festival as a conductor, soprano, and course instructor. She tours and records with the Pomerium Renaissance vocal ensemble and toured and performed for nine years with the Western Wind, which is an a cappella sextet. In addition, she has recorded for Bobby McFerrin and collaborated on works for movement and vocal ensemble with the Christopher Caines Dancers.

He was sentenced to 20 years in jail but only served four.UN war crimes tribunal convicts 6 Bosnian Croats of persecution of Muslims during Bosnian war, news1130.com; accessed 14 April 2015. The ICTY Appeals Chamber affirmed almost all of the convictions against Petkoviƒá and his co-defendants, as well as their original length of sentence, on 29 November 2017. Background Milivoj Petkoviƒá was born in ≈†ibenik, Dalmatia, FPR Yugoslavia. He was a career military officer, graduating from the Yugoslav People's Army (\\"JNA\\") military academy. In July 1991 he left the JNA to join the new Croatian Army. In 1992 he was ordered by Croatian Army General Janko Bobetko to take over the Croatian Army's forward command center in the town of Grude, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, this force would later become the HVO armed forces. He was Chief of Staff of HVO until about 5 August 1994. A General in the Croatian Army, he was partially disabled due to a concussion and spine injury sustained in June 1992 while driving near the Neretva River, as documented by the authorities of the then-Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia. Petkoviƒá voluntarily surrendered to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on 5 April 2004. He was granted provisional release on 22 April 2008, after serving only four years of a twenty-year sentence. However, his original 20 year sentence was later upheld on 29 November 2017. Indictment Milivoj Petkoviƒá at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 2013 In the indictment it is alleged that, as the overall HVO commander, Petkoviƒá directly commanded the Herceg- Bosna/HVO armed forces and is responsible for its actions. It is alleged that among other things the HVO armed forces: *ethnically cleansed the districts of Gornji Vakuf, Mostar *used the Heliodrom Camp as a detention centre where the Bosnian Muslims from Mostar were detained. Conditions at the Heliodrom concentration camp were deemed inhumane. The charges were:Taken from the UN press release *nine counts of grave breaches of the Geneva conventions (wilful killing; inhuman treatment (sexual assault); unlawful deportation of a civilian; unlawful transfer of a civilian; unlawful confinement of a civilian; inhuman treatment (conditions of confinement); inhuman treatment; extensive destruction of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly; appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly). *nine counts of violations of the laws or customs of war (cruel treatment (conditions of confinement); cruel treatment; unlawful labour; wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or destruction not justified by military necessity; destruction or wilful damage done to institutions dedicated to religion or education; plunder of public or private property; unlawful attack on civilians; unlawful infliction of terror on civilians; cruel treatment), and *eight counts of crimes against humanity (persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds; murder; rape; deportation; inhumane acts (forcible transfer); imprisonment; inhumane acts (conditions of confinement); inhumane acts).

Synopsis The novel introduces I. M. Fletcher, a journalist and ex-marine camping on a beach watching the drug culture for a story, waiting to find the dealer's source before publishing an expos√©. A millionaire businessman named Alan Stanwyk approaches Fletch to hire Fletch to murder him; the man tells Fletch that he is dying of bone cancer and wants to avoid a slow, painful death. Fletch accepts $1000 in cash to listen to the man's proposition; the man offers him $20,000 for the murder, and Fletch talks him up to $50,000 in an effort to see if the man is serious. He appears to be sincere, and Fletch begins investigating the man's story in between investigating the drug story on the beach and hiding from the two attorneys after him for alimony for each of his ex-wives. Sequels Because of the popularity of Fletch, many sequels (and prequels) were written involving the character. The following books were written in the Fletch series by Gregory McDonald (in the stories' chronological order): *Fletch Won (1985) *Fletch, Too (1986) *Fletch and the Widow Bradley (1981) *Fletch (1974) *Carioca Fletch (1984) *Confess, Fletch (1976) *Fletch's Fortune (1978) *Fletch's Moxie (1982) *Fletch and the Man Who (1983) *Son of Fletch (1993) *Fletch Reflected (1994) McDonald wanted the final two books (featuring Fletch's son Jack) to be spin-offs called Jack's Story and Jack and the Perfect Mirror, respectively. In Confess, Fletch, McDonald introduced another popular character, Inspector Francis Xavier Flynn, a brilliant but eccentric police detective who serves as a foil for Fletch. Flynn would go on to star in four of his own spin-off novels: Flynn (1977), The Buck Passes Flynn (1981), Flynn's In (1984), and Flynn's World (2003). Awards and nominations Fletch won a 1975 Edgar Allan Poe Award, for Best First Novel, from the Mystery Writers of America. The sequel, Confess, Fletch, also won an Edgar Award, for Best Paperback Original, in 1977. As Mcdonald's official website notes: \\"The only time a novel and its sequel won back-to-back Edgars.\\" Adaptations The novel was loosely adapted into a comedy film, Fletch (1985), starring Chevy Chase.

There were several attempts to do a Fletch 3/Fletch Won, including a 1998 deal with Kevin Smith as well as names like Jason Lee and Ben Affleck as the new Irwin M. Fletcher. After delays and the release of his movie Dogma, Smith withdrew from the project. In 2011, \\"Fletch Won\\", was in development again.

The family included builders, coastguards, farmers, labourers, mariners, seamen, servants and public school boys, tailors. The Oxford Dictionary of Surnames gives the origin of Scantlebury as: \\"English (West Country) of unknown origin perhaps a habitation name from Kentisbury or Kentisbeare both found in Devon with an added \\"S\\". Both villages can be found in the Domesday Book. Kentisbury in South Devon near Cullompton is spelt Chentesberie in the Domesday Book, Kentelesbere in 1240 and Kentesbyire in 1252 in Fleet Fines. Kentisbury in North Devon spelt Chentesberie in the Domesday Book Kentelesberi in 1260 and Kentelesberi in 1275.\\" Another plausible theory is that Skentel is a Cornish word meaning \\"Craftsman\\", and bery/bury is an old English word for house/hamlet, so Skentelbery/Scantlebury could translate in simple Old English to a \\"Thatcher\\". Recorded variations and spellings of Scantlebury include Skentbewe (1561), Skentelbewe (1690), Skentlebury (1649), Skantilbew (1575), Skentlebewe (1612), Scentilbewy (1601), Scantlebewe (1622), Skentelbury (1785), and Scantlebury (1809). Parish registers started in 1538 when Henry VIII's Vicar-General Thomas Cromwell ordered that each parish priest should keep registers of each baptism, burial and marriage taking place in his parish. The earliest parish record of a Scantlebury was the marriage of Thomas, son of John Skantilbew, and Mary, daughter of Andrew Pale, in the parish church of Lanreath in Cornwall. The following extracts from the parish register of East Greenwich, Kent, record the births of seven children to the same Scantlebury family, although each child had its surname spelt differently: *\\"29 June 1789 Cantelbury Jane, daughter of Walter and Sarah\\" *\\"18 October 1790 Canterbury Elizabeth, daughter of Walter and Sarah\\" *\\"20 May 1793 Scantelbury William son of Walter and Sarah\\" *\\"11 August 1794 Scantelbury Charles son of Walter and Sarah\\" *\\"6 August 1795 Scanterberry Ann daughter of Walter and Sarah\\" *\\"17 September 1798 Scanterburry John son of Walter and Sarah\\" *\\"13 October 1802 Scantalbury Richard son of Walter and Sarah\\" Walter's occupation was given as \\"Collegeman\\", he was a resident at the Greenwich Naval Hospital, and originally from Cornwall.

Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. is the producer of Benicar (Olmesartan), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and top selling drug in the U.S. Global sales of Olmesartan in 2013 were 300.2 billion yen. Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. (DSI) began operating in the U.S. in 2006. It is the U.S. subsidiary of Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, and a member of the Daiichi Sankyo Group.

History  Daiichi Sankyo was established in 2005 through the merger of and , which were century- old pharmaceutical companies based in Japan. Sankyo Co., Ltd. was founded by Dr. Jokichi Takamine, who patented the isolation of adrenalin. Takamine was also the first president of Sankyo Co., Ltd from March 1913 ‚Äì July 1922. = Kickbacks = Daiichi Sankyo is being \\"closely monitored\\" after settling charges concerning payment of remuneration to physicians in the form of speaker fees as part of company's Physician Organization and Discussion program, in violation of the False Claims Act, an anti-kickback statute. Daiichi Sankyo agreed to pay the United States and state Medicaid programs $39 million to settle allegations by the United States Department of Justice over kickbacks to doctors. As part of the company's Physician Organization and Discussion program, Daiichi Sankyo paid physicians improper kickbacks in the form of speaker fees to induce physicians to prescribe Daiichi drugs, including Azor, Benicar, Tribenzor and Welchol. Allegedly, payments were made to physicians even when physician participants in PODs took turns ‚Äúspeaking‚Äù on duplicative topics over Daiichi-paid dinners, the recipient spoke only to members of his or her own staff in his or her own office, or the associated dinner was so lavish that its cost exceeded Daiichi's own internal cost limitation of $140 per person. ‚ÄúSchemes such as this are particularly abhorrent,‚Äù said Inspector General Daniel R. Levinson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ‚ÄúManufacturers and physicians who engage in them are cheating Medicare and Medicaid out of millions of dollars and threatening programs upon which many elderly and disabled Americans rely. My office will take whatever steps necessary to guard against improper alliances between manufacturers of drugs and those who prescribe them. Through our corporate integrity agreement we will be closely monitoring Daiichi.‚Äù = Acquisitions = In 2006, Daiichi Sankyo acquired Zepharma, the OTC drugs unit of Astellas Pharma. On June 10, 2008, Daiichi Sankyo agreed to take a majority (64%) stake in Indian generic drug maker Ranbaxy, with a deal valued at about $4.6 billion. In June 2008, Daiichi Sankyo acquired U3 Pharma, which would contribute a therapeutic anti-HER3 antibody to the company's anticancer portfolio. On April 4, 2011 Daiichi Sankyo completed the acquisition of Plexxikon, a Berkeley, California-based pharmaceutical start-up company for $805 million and an additional $130 million in milestone payments, pending on the success of Vemurafenib (Plexxikon's lead program) an oral, novel drug that targets the oncogenic BRAF mutation present in about half of melanoma cancers and about eight percent of all solid tumors. Daiichi Sankyo is retaining US co-promotion right of the (Roche licensed) drug. On April 7, 2014, Daiichi Sankyo announced that it has agreed to vote its shares in Ranbaxy in favor of Sun Pharma's acquisition of 100% of Ranbaxy through the merger process which entails a share swap. The transaction is set to close in December 2014, pending shareholder, court and regulatory approvals and other customary conditions.

She appeared in more than 40 films, often with her name above the title. Early years O'Neil was one of eleven children born to Judge Thomas Francis Patrick Noonan and his wife, Hannah Kelly, a Metropolitan Opera singer, in Bayonne, New Jersey. One of her sisters was actress Suzanne Dobson Noonan, an actress known professionally as Molly O'Day. Another sister, Isabelle, also acted in films.  Films  Convent-educated, she started her career in vaudeville, billed as Chotsie Noonan and known for her petite but curvaceous frame and curly brown hair. She was teamed with Constance Bennett and Joan Crawford in the MGM film Sally, Irene and Mary (1925), directed by Edmund Goulding, which was \\"her big break.\\" She was paired with Crawford again as a WAMPAS Baby Star in 1926. Her fame began to subside after sound films replaced silent pictures; she also had a problem with stage fright. Her pictures include The Brat, a 1931 pre-Code film directed by John Ford and screened at New York City's Museum of Modern Art in November 2016. A showcase for O'Neil, the movie involves a brash chorus girl's effect upon a snobbish family when their son brings her home in order to research a novel. Stage O'Neil appeared on Broadway in When We Are Married (1940). Later years By the late 1930s, her film career was over, but she continued on stage and toured with the USO until the 1950s.

The first version was released in 1997.  History  Since Jordan Russell wasn't satisfied with InstallShield Express which he had received upon purchase of Borland Delphi, he decided to make his own installer. The first public version was 1.09. To make an installation package with version 1.09, an \\"ISS.TXT\\" file needed to be created in the installation directory. In the file, the user needed to supply variables and values which are still used in Inno Setup today. These variables served as the configuration of the installation package but many other features could not be changed. The installation compiler had no editor and was more of a shell to compile scripts. Inno Setup grew popular due to being free and open source; free for both commercial and non-commercial use, many software companies switched to the tool. Since Inno Setup was based around scripting, fans of Inno Setup started ISTool and ScriptMaker to aid in visual and simpler ways to make installations for Inno Setup. Inno Setup has won many awards including the Shareware Industry Awards three times in a row ‚Äî from 2002 to 2004.

Malkiel argues that asset prices typically exhibit signs of a random walk and that one cannot consistently outperform market averages. The book is frequently cited by those in favor of the efficient- market hypothesis. As of 2020, there have been twelve editions and over 1.5 million copies sold.Burton Malkiel (2011) A random walk down Wall Street: the time-tested strategy for successful investing A practical popularization is The Random Walk Guide to Investing: Ten Rules for Financial Success.Hardback: , Paperback: Investing techniques Malkiel examines some popular investing techniques, including technical analysis and fundamental analysis, in light of academic research studies of these methods. Through detailed analysis, he notes significant flaws in both techniques, concluding that, for most investors, following these methods will produce inferior results compared to passive strategies. Malkiel has a similar critique for methods of selecting actively managed mutual funds based upon past performances. He cites studies indicating that actively managed mutual funds vary greatly in their success rates over the long term, often underperforming in years following their successes, thereby regressing toward the mean. Malkiel suggests that given the distribution of fund performances, it is statistically unlikely that an average investor would happen to select those few mutual funds which will outperform their benchmark index over the long term. Alternative view In 1984, Warren Buffett gave a speech at Columbia University rebutting the Efficient Market Hypothesis. See The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville. , Malkiel has not yet responded and has ignored Buffett's argument. However, Buffett does recommend to his supporters that they should do passive index investing rather than individual stock investing. In the 2013 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter, he had this to say about where he would suggest the trustee of his estate put his money when he died, \\"10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P; 500 index fund (I suggest Vanguard‚Äôs).\\" When asked what advice he would give to investors, Buffett had this to say: \\"lethargy bordering on sloth remains the best investment style.

The first nation governs the 2,392.6-hectare parcel of New Credit 40A Indian Reserve known as Reserve 40B near Hagersville, Ontario. This reserve is located near the Six Nations of the Grand River in Brantford. In the 19th century, the Mississaugas wanted to move from a reserve in the present-day City of Mississauga.

The reserve is territory granted to Six Nations as gratitude for allying with the British during the American Revolutionary War by the Haldimand Proclamation. The Six Nations is the only reserve in the Canadian system with a subsection reserve. The Mississaugas eventually purchased the land gifted as well as an additional for a sum of $10,000.00 on June 15, 1903, for the all- time right of undisturbed use and occupancy of the land. The reserve as it stands today consists of lots 1 to 12 in the first and second concessions in the Township of Tuscarora, in the County of Brant, and lots 1-12 in the first and second concessions in the Township of Oneida. In 1997, MCFN purchased an additional bordering on Highway 6, Hagersville. The First Nation made claims to land on which Toronto sits through the disputed Toronto Purchase of 1787. In 2010, Canada agreed to pay for the lands, based on the historic value of the land, extrapolated to current dollars. The money was distributed to the band government, with each of the 1,700 present day Mississaugas receiving $20,000, with the rest placed in trust for future generations. The Band put a controversial hold on new band membership during this time, ostensibly to preserve the greatest financial gain possible. The multi-million dollar settlement was only given to previously registered members despite any valid claims to membership.Source: New Credit Band Council meeting minutes, 2010‚Äì11 On January 8, 2019 the Mississaugas of the New Credit announced that they would rename as The Mississaugas of the Credit.

Carlisle was a midfielder during his playing career, primarily right-sided, but able to play in a wide range of positions. He has been capped by Northern Ireland at youth, under-21 level and B international. Carlisle is currently assistant manager at Exeter City F.C. having been appointed in 2019. Career He began his career with then English Championship side Crystal Palace. Due to the club's financial troubles during the late 1990s, first-team opportunities became available for the then-young trainee. He made his league debut in February 1999 in Palace's 1‚Äì1 draw at home to Birmingham City. Carlisle featured in 46 first team league matches while at Selhurst Park, but when Simon Jordan stepped in to save the club, investments in more experienced and high-profile players limited Carlisle's chances. In October 2001 Carlisle moved on loan to Swindon Town for three months, where he featured in 11 matches, scoring 2 goals. On 28 March 2002, Carlisle moved on a free transfer to League Two side Bristol Rovers. In his over two years at Memorial Stadium, Carlisle produced a scoring record of 14 goals in 71 matches, this despite the team struggling against relegation. With Rovers needing to cut costs, Carlisle, along with teammate Danny Boxall was placed on the transfer list in December 2003. He was released by Rovers in May 2004 and joined then League Two side Leyton Orient on a two-year contract the following month. In the 2005-06 season, Carlisle was restricted to mostly appearances from the bench, and transferred to Conference National side Exeter City in the January transfer window. Carlisle started promisingly with his new club, breaking straight into the first team, but his season was ended prematurely with a broken leg suffered against Tamworth. At the end of the season, departing manager Alex Inglethorpe released Carlisle on a free transfer. On 6 October 2006 Carlisle was re-signed by new Exeter City manager Paul Tisdale after impressing as an early season trialist. Carlisle was taken to hospital on 19 October 2006 to have his appendix removed. He broke back into the Exeter City first team, was offered an extended contract, and was involved in their promotion to the Football League in 2008, scoring in both of the play-off semi-final games against local rivals Torquay United. Although offered a contract by Exeter, Carlisle chose to join Torquay United in May 2008, where on his third visit to the new Wembley in three years Carlisle gained his 2nd consecutive promotion. Carlisle started the 2009‚Äì10 season in fine form but early in the new year sustained a knee injury which restricted him to on a handful of games before the end of the season. Carlisle signed a six-month contract with Torquay United at the start of the 2010‚Äì11 season but in January 2011 took the decision to retire from professional football to pursue a career in player development at Ivybridge Community College, Devon. On 4 March 2011, Carlisle signed for Southern Premier League side Truro City but his spell there was short lived and in May 2011 he retired from playing football altogether to focus on a career in coaching. Carlisle is now assistant manager at former club Exeter City, having been appointed in July 2019 after the departure of Eric Kinder.

An initial, disputed, agreement was made in 1787, in exchange for various items. The agreement was revisited in 1805, intended to clarify the area purchased. The agreement remained in dispute for over 200 years until 2010, when a settlement for the land was made between the Government of Canada and the Mississaugas for the land and other lands in the area. 1787 purchase A map of the Toronto purchase. notable is the British surveyor's insistence on using a grid, instead of using the natural features to demarcate boundaries, such as Etobicoke Creek. Under the Treaty of Paris which ended the conflict between Great Britain and its former colonies, the boundary of British North America was set in the middle of the Great Lakes. This made the land north of the border more important, strategically and as the place for Loyalists to settle after the war. In 1781, the Mississaugas surrendered a strip of land along the Niagara River, and in 1783, land on the Bay of Quinte for the Mohawks who had been loyal to the British to settle (today's Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory). Between 1783 and 1785, 10,000 Loyalists arrived and were settling on land the Crown had recognized as Indian Land. In 1784, the Mississaugas surrendered more land in the Niagara peninsula, including land on the Grand River for the Iroquois. In 1786, Lord Dorchester arrived in Quebec City as Governor-in-Chief of British North America. His mission was to solve the problems of the newly landed Loyalists. At first, Dorchester suggested opening the new Canada West as districts under the Quebec government, but the British Government made known its intention to split Canada into Upper and Lower Canada. Dorchester began organizing for the new province of Upper Canada, including a capital. Dorchester's first choice was Kingston, but was aware of the number of Loyalists in the Bay of Quinte and Niagara areas, and chose instead the location north of the Bay of Toronto, midway between the settlements and from the US. Under the policy of the time, the British recognized aboriginal title to the land and Dorchester arranged to purchase the lands from the Mississaugas. The 1787 purchase, according to British records, was conducted on September 23, 1787, at the \\"Carrying-Place\\" of Bay of Quinte. The British crown and the Mississaugas of New Credit met to arrange for the surrender of lands along Lake Ontario. In the case of the Toronto area, the Mississaugas of New Credit exchanged of land in what became York County (most of current Toronto and the Regional Municipality of York bounded by Lake Ontario to the south, approximately Etobicoke Creek and Highways 427 and 50 (both part of a now mostly-vanished road known as Indian Line, which was named due to it forming the purchase boundary) to the west, approximately Ashbridge's Bay/Woodbine Avenue-Highway 404 to the east and approximately south of Sideroad 15-Bloomington Road to the north) for some money, 2,000 gun flints, 24 brass kettles, 120 mirrors, 24 laced hats, a bale of flowered flannel, and 96 gallons of rum. At the time, the Mississaugas believed that the agreement was not a purchase extinguishing their rights to the land, but a rental of the lands for British use in exchange for gifts and presents in perpetuity. In 1788, surveyor Alexander Aitken was assigned to conduct a survey of the Toronto site. The Mississaugas blocked him for surveying west of the Humber, saying the lands to the west had not been ceded. Aitken was only allowed to survey the land after British authorities interceded with the Mississaugas. Aitken surveyed west to Etobicoke Creek, but did not survey more than a few miles from the lake (as far north as the northern limit of where the creek forms the present Toronto-Mississauga limits) before stopping to avoid further confrontation. 1805 indenture An Indenture (a revision) of the deal was made on August 1, 1805. Both the 1787 Purchase and its 1805 Indenture were registered as Crown Treaty No. 13. For this revision, the Mississaugas were given the amount of ten shillings equivalent to about $27 in 2010 dollars. The Mississaugas of New Credit First Nation also claimed the Toronto Islands, which was not part of the purchase as the agreement only went to the Lake Ontario shoreline. The land sold consists of: * former City of Etobicoke * former City of North York * former (pre-amalgamation) City of Toronto * former City of York * former Borough of East York * City of Vaughan * King Township * southwestern part of Markham * western part of Whitchurch The Purchased was signed by Sir John Johnson, William Claus (deputy superintendent of Indian Affairs representing the Crown).

Content The album is representative of the material artists of the Nueva Canci√≥n Chilena released in exile after the military coup of September 11, 1973. It opens with a song in homage to the fallen socialist president Salvador Allende and proceeds with a moving musical elegy to Che Guevara. There are instrumental andean music pieces: ‚ÄòCanci√≥n de la esperanza‚Äô composed by Eduardo Carrasco and a version of the traditional Bolivian piece ‚ÄòTiticaca‚Äô. ‚ÄòEl alma llena de banderas‚Äô a song Victor Jara dedicated to the murder of a young worker is included, as well as songs denouncing the violent military repression against an unarmed people. The most well known song of the album is Quilapay√∫n & Sergio Ortega‚Äôs ¬°El pueblo unido jam√°s ser√° vencido!, originally composed as a march for the Popular Unity government; after the September 11, 1973 military coup it became the international anthem of the Chilean resistance. The song has been translated into a number of languages and has been heard in mass rallies, marches and demonstrations all over the world: from students in Iran, to migrant workers in California, to pro- unification rallies in Berlin. In 2004 the song inspired Razom nas bahato, nas ne podolaty by GreenJolly, which became the unofficial anthem of the Orange Revolution in the Ukraine.

He served as mayor of Toronto in 1859 and 1860 and in the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada for York North from 1860 to 1863. After his political career, he served as a judge and was named Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench. At the time of his retirement, he was the longest-serving judge in Ontario and was subsequently knighted. Early life and career Adam Wilson was born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1814 to Jane and Andrew Wilson. He attended Heriot‚Äôs Hospital in Edinburgh before immigrating to Halton County, Upper Canada in 1830 to work with his uncle. In 1834, he moved to Toronto where he articled for Robert Baldwin and Robert Baldwin Sullivan and was called to the bar in 1839. The following year, he was made partner at the Baldwin law firm. In 1850, he became Queen's Counsel and in 1856 he was named to a commission whose work formed the basis for the General Public Statutes of the Province of Canada. In 1858 he was a founding member of the North-West Transportation, Navigation and Railway Company. He also sued Prime Minister John A. Macdonald and two other ministers in 1858 for illegally keeping their political positions. Municipal politics Wilson was elected to Toronto city council in 1855, representing St. Patrick‚Äôs Ward. He led a group of councillors who were against the influence of the railway companies in council decisions. He also organised an investigation on how Casimir Gzowski won a contract to construct the Esplanade. Wilson was encouraged to run in the 1959 mayoral election of Toronto by the Municipal Reform Association, a Reform group who opposed the Conservative dominance of Toronto municipal politics. His campaign focused on the railway business‚Äô influence over alderman‚Äôs decisions on council. His concerns included the Grand Trunk Railway putting trains between residents and Lake Ontario and the pollution that accumulated in various water sources along the Toronto waterfront. Wilson won the 1959 mayoral election in Toronto‚Äôs first direct election for mayor and won a subsequent campaign for mayor in 1860. His time in office included an initiative to simplify the city‚Äôs by- laws, which the Canadian Law Journal cited as an ‚Äúindescribable confusion.‚Äù He also focused on police reform and was a member of the Toronto Board of Police Commissioners when they fired the deputy police chief of Toronto. Politics in the Legislative Council Wilson was elected to the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada in an 1860 by-election in the riding of York North. The following year he was reelected in his York North riding but lost his simultaneous election in the riding of Toronto West. In May 1862 he became Solicitor General for Upper Canada but was not reappointed the following year. Judicial career Wilson resigned from politics in 1863 and was named a judge in the Court of Queen's Bench. He was part of the Court of Common Pleas and was an ex-officio judge of Error and Appeal until 1874. In 1871 he was appointed to the Ontario Law Reform Commission. In 1878, Wilson became chief justice in the Court of Common Pleas and, in 1884, was named to the same function in the Court of Queen's Bench. In 1876 Wilson claimed that George Brown wrote a letter ‚Äúfor corrupt purposes‚Äù and that Reform engaged in corrupt practices during previous elections. Brown was asked to answer this letter in front of judges in a ‚Äúcontempt of court‚Äù charge. The judges in this case disagreed on their findings and there were no further proceedings. In his rulings, Wilson would bring together applicable precedents but have little analysis of how they worked together to come to a conclusion. He also cited American law and tried to show independence from British law. He was also credited with the huge amount of research that he conducted for his rulings. Writing career In 1861 Wilson wrote _The constable‚Äôs guide; a sketch of the office of constable_. Honours and achievements At his retirement Wilson was the longest-serving judge in Ontario. He was also knighted. Wilson Township in Parry Sound District, Ontario is named after him. Personal life and death Wilson married Emma Dalton on May 1, 1841, and adopted a daughter. He died in Toronto on December 28, 1891.

It was named in 1839 by the surveyor William Darke. A township developed and was initially known as Aitken's Gap. By the 1890s it had commonly become known as Buttlejorrk. A Post Office opened on 5 September 1856 as The Gap, was renamed Buttlejork (sic) in 1875 and closed in 1919. One of the early settlers in the area was George Millett. George and his wife Suzanne established the Bald Hill Hotel, the first staging stop out of Melbourne on the road to the goldfields at Bendigo. The hotel was licensed in 1853 until 1907. The Aitken's Gap Gaol, now located in the forecourt of the Sunbury Police Station stood beside the hotel Segment of The Gap, Buttlejorrk Town Map  History  It was reported in the Argus 21 October 1852- \\"Bushrangers at Aitken's Gap-Five armed and mounted bushrangers \\"bailed\\" up and robbed a gentleman riding in the neighbourhood of Aitken's Gap on Tuesday morning last about 11 o'clock\\". A settlement also grew at Aitken‚Äôs Gap, which was one of the key stages of the trip to the gold-fields. It was still a wild place in 1858 when traveller William Kelly arrived on the coach:- \\"Arrived at the top, it was a scene of extraordinary bustle and uproar, for it was then a special camping place for drivers and carriers, and the scores upon scores of horse drays and bullock-wagons that were preparing for a start, produced an amount of tumult, altercation, blasphemy, and compound abominations which would not find many readers even if I succeeded in reproducing it.\\" Why this spot was a staging-post is not clear. Perhaps it had to do with the achievement of the summit, and the end of the long haul that finished the ‚ÄòKeilor Plains‚Äô stage of the journey. No doubt a spring of water, the branch of the Kororoit Creek which passed there, was vital.Bald Hill Hotel Buttlejorrk circa 1890 However, when John Chandler and his horses arrived there \\"nearly famished\\" some years beforehand he had had to buy five buckets of water, at two shillings a bucket, at a shanty. Hotels (the Gap Inn, the Manchester and the Bald Hill) and stores were erected in the vicinity, and in 1854 the Government moved to formalise the township. The original Gap Inn and a store (in which a post office was established in 1856) were located centrally on a block of the main street on the Government‚Äôs later survey. Archaeological evidence remains of the Gap and Bald Hill inns. There were also burials behind the Aitkens Gap hotel; these may have been removed very early. Aitken‚Äôs Gap police station was by far the largest forage requirement in the whole of the Bourke District, indicative of its significance as a changing station for the gold escort. Together with most of the other wayside 1850s goldrush police stations, it was closed down in the early 1863 after the railway was opened to Bendigo. Most buildings were removed elsewhere, but the sturdy bluestone police lock-up has to remain. It survived in a deteriorated condition as a farm outbuilding until its removal and reconstruction in Sunbury in 1989. Its former site is now on a new house block; a bench associated with a former building appears to remain, along with a scatter of hand-made bricks that could have come from the chimney that had been added to it at a later date. It is likely that this site retains archaeological evidence of a seminal, ephemeral, and colourful event in Australia‚Äôs history. It may constitute rare evidence of an inter-town police station, an integral part of the main goldrush roads. As the Bendigo railway beyond Sunbury opened in stages from 1859, The Gap‚Äôs fortunes declined dramatically. It struggled on as a town serving a local farming community. A Church of England school opened at the settlement in 1857, and a state school continued until 1900. In the 1990s no relic could be found of the Caroline Chisholm shelter shed that had been erected at the Gap during the gold rush. The one surviving row of the avenue of old Monterey Pines (Pinus radiata) on the Calder Highway is today the most prominent evidence of the former township. The pines could have been planted at any time between the 1870s and 1920s, probably as part of a Melton Shire town beautification policy. They are the same as those that survive on Gap Road and several of the streets of Sunbury that were once a part of Melton Shire. (Maybe they served to mark Melton‚Äôs fragile proprietorship in the area.) In Victoria conifer plantings had been recommended for street planting in the 1860s, but from the 1880s they were often replaced by deciduous trees, and the Monterey Pines at Aitkens Gap are one of only a few stands of old conifer street plantings which remain in Victoria.  Fire  It was reported in the Argus on Friday 6 April that Mr. Chandler, of the Legislative assembly. held an inquest yesterday upon the cause of a trifling fire which occurred on the 17th ult, in a bedroom at the Bald Hills Hotel, Aitken's Gap. After hearing the evidence adduced, the jury found that the fire was accidentally caused by a little boy, the son of the landlord, having set fire to the place by striking a match with which to light a candle. On 14 January 1944 a fire that stretched from Woodend to the Gap destroyed 30 houses and devastated the Couangalt area just north of the Shire. Melton Shire property owners, Messrs Borbidge, Gilligan, Millett, had narrow escapes. The Toolern Brigade working on the west side of the front were unable to prevent 2100 acres of Mr Scott‚Äôs Mount Aitken estate, and its historic 14 room bluestone house, being burnt out. But they stopped the flames just to the south, on the doorstep of Mr Townsing‚Äôs farm (originally the Beaty‚Äôs Rocklands), where 700 tons of hay was stacked. Mr R Benson also lost a house. It may also have been this fire that destroyed the timber part of the cottage on the Shire boundary on Blackhill Road.  Preservation  The loss of several local heritage landmarks in Sunbury in the late 1980s spurred Peter Free to campaign to preserve the Aitkens Gap Gaol. The Sunbury Historical and Heritage Society president achieved his aim in 1992 after securing $24,000 in state funding. The jail was not only saved from demolition and restored but relocated as well. Mr Free and volunteers from Rupertswood Battery moved all the jail‚Äôs bluestone \\"bricks\\" from its original site at the Gap to the Sunbury police station. \\"We numbered every one and laid them out on the lawn of the police station,\\" he said. Stonemason Tom Molyneax was in charge of the project that was also supported by local police and the former Bulla Shire Council. Mr Free said the jail had a chequered past. Built in 1857, it had two cells but during the gold rush boom the cells were used to store gold nuggets. Prisoners were instead kept outside in shackles. Mr Free‚Äôs next vision is to create a rail museum to celebrate 150 years of rail in Sunbury. Aitkens Gap Gaol is part of the Old Sunbury Township heritage drive developed by the Sunbury District Heritage Society. President Veronica Burgess said the drive was built on four existing Sunbury Heritage Walks, with brochures to be available from the Sunbury Tourist Centre next month. Other Sunbury landmarks on the drive include: * The Ball Court Hotel, built on the site of the Farmers Arm Hotel; * Dunblane, an early Sunbury mansion built in 1893; * The Sunbury Cemetery, Jacksons Hill and the Sunbury Asylum;  Other names  Buttlejorrk has also be known as * Aitken's Gap * The Gap  References   External links  *Buttlejorrk, County of Bourke, NLA Towns in Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Buttlejorrk, Victoria"},{"id":"5715588","text":"The 2006 FIFA World Cup generated various controversies, including onfield disputes, critiques of official decisions, and team salary issues. Most centered on specific refereeing decisions, which led many of the world's media to claim that the referees were spoiling the World Cup. Numerous World Cup records were also set by controversial calls, including Graham Poll's three- card error and Valentin Ivanov's record number of cards in a single match. FIFA's \\"Fair Play\\" agreement also came under intense scrutiny during the tournament, particularly during the second-round match between Portugal and Netherlands.  Refereeing  = Three yellow cards issued (Croatia vs. Australia, group stage) = The deciding game for the Group F runners-up place, Croatia vs. Australia, saw the English referee Graham Poll mistakenly issue three yellow cards to Croatian Josip ≈†imuniƒá before sending him off. ≈†imuniƒá was shown a yellow card by Poll in the 61st minute for a foul on Harry Kewell. In the 90th minute, Poll again showed Simuniƒá a yellow card for a foul, but did not follow it with a mandatory red card. In the 93rd minute, after Poll had blown the final whistle, ≈†imuniƒá approached Poll angrily and gave him a push. Poll thus issued ≈†imuniƒá with a third yellow card and also showed him the red card. Questions were raised as to why Poll's assistants Phil Sharp and Glenn Turner, and the fourth official Kevin Stott, had also failed to realise the error. Poll later denied any blame should be placed upon the other officials saying, \\"I was the referee, it was my error and the buck stops with me\\". Poll reported that the officials had felt \\"disbelief\\" upon hearing of the error in the dressing room after the game. He and the other officials consequently reviewed the DVD of the game, and Poll realised that his \\"dream was over\\". The Football Federation Australia chief executive John O'Neill later said that \\"Australia could have had grounds for a very strong appeal should Croatia have won the match\\". Poll also explained the reason for his mistake by saying that he \\"incorrectly noted down the name of the Australia number three Craig Moore when booking ≈†imuniƒá for the second time and failed to realise his error\\" ≈†imuniƒá is Australian-born, and hence speaks English with an Australian accent, probably causing the mistake. The FIFA Referees Committee President √Ångel Mar√≠a Villar defended Poll but had to concede that an error had occurred. In a statement he remarked, \\"Thursday evening's 2‚Äì2 draw between Croatia and Australia in Stuttgart saw referee Graham Poll make an error\\". As a result of his error, Poll and his assistants did not progress to the second stage of the tournament. Despite encouragement from the FIFA president Sepp Blatter and chief executives of the Football Association and Premier League, Poll retired from international tournaments. He explained his decision to retire was a result of the \\"pain and agony\\" and \\"sleepless nights\\" that resulted from his mistake and the fear of it happening again. = Australia vs. Japan (Group stage) = In the first-round game of Australia versus Japan, the Egyptian referee Essam Abd El Fatah awarded a 26th-minute goal by Shunsuke Nakamura to the Japanese despite a protest from Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. Schwarzer appeared to have been impeded by the Japanese forward Atsushi Yanagisawa as he came forward to punch the ball clear. The Japanese striker Naohiro Takahara then collided with Schwarzer, leaving him unable to prevent the ball rolling into the goal. Schwarzer told reporters later that El Fatah had apologised to him for his mistake and had told Australia's captain Mark Viduka that he was grateful \\"that God was on his side because the result went Australia's way in the end.\\" Viduka told reporters \\"it was obvious that he made a mistake but everybody makes a mistake.\\" Abdul-Fatah denied issuing an apology however, and said that \\"FIFA's refereeing committee... agreed unanimously that Japan's goal against Australia was correct\\", and would have awarded a penalty against Australia had the ball not gone in, as Takahara was pushed into Schwarzer by Craig Moore . Australia's coach Guus Hiddink chose to \\"slightly, but not totally, apologise\\" for an off-field incident in which he pushed an official in a scramble to see a television replay of the goal. Hiddink said he believed it was an obvious foul, but also that Schwarzer \\"can defend himself even more\\" against such incidents. The FIFA communications director Markus Siegler told the press later that a penalty should have been awarded to Japan for a foul on the Japanese midfielder Y≈´ichi Komano by Tim Cahill. Siegler said \\"it was a clear mistake of the referee.\\" Had a yellow card been shown to Cahill, who scored the deciding goal for Australia minutes later, he would have been sent off, with the score at 1‚Äì1. The Japanese coach Zico expressed frustration at FIFA's comments, saying that El Fatah had apologised for the mistake to the Australians but had not apologised for the error that FIFA admitted to. The Japan Football Association filed an official complaint against the Egyptian referee, who was sent home along with the English referee Graham Poll. = France vs. Korea Republic (Group stage) = In the 31st minute of the game between France and Korea Republic, the French midfielder Patrick Vieira had a header at goal which appeared to be saved by Korean goalkeeper Lee Woon-Jae from behind the goal line. Mexican referee Benito Archundia and his linesmen did not believe the ball had passed the line, and no goal was awarded. The game resulted in a last minute 1‚Äì1 draw, shocking the French. French coach Raymond Domenech believed that France \\"scored a second time, but the referee did not recognize that.\\" Television replays showed that the goal should have been awarded. French player Thierry Henry claimed the team was \\"really upset\\" when they saw the ball had passed the goal-line as \\"if he (the referee) had given us the valid goal, that would not have offered the Koreans the opportunity to come back into the match.\\" However, it should also be noted that the corner kick leading to the header should have been a goal kick, as the ball had gone out of bounds off a French player. In addition, there appeared to be a whistle on the play for a foul on France, which would have negated the goal anyway. The controversy revived questions over the possibility of goal-line technology use at the World Cup. A FIFA spokesperson, Markus Siegler, ruled out the short term likelihood saying that \\"its introduction depends on a system being developed that is 100 percent reliable\\". French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez voiced opposition to video replays during a game as \\"it's a shame to stop the play.\\" Barthez said that he'd like to see more referees with \\"one in each half, and one behind each goal.\\" = Portugal vs. Netherlands (Round of 16) = Referee Valentin Ivanov set a new record for the number of red cards issued in a World Cup match with four, and tied the record for yellow cards with 16. FIFA president Sepp Blatter said of Ivanov, \\"I consider that today the referee was not at the same level as the participants, the players. There could have been a yellow card for the referee,\\" although he later recanted, saying, \\"I regret what I said about his actions in the match between Portugal and the Netherlands.\\" The managers also blamed each other for not playing fairly; Portugal's Luiz Felipe Scolari said, \\"FIFA talks about fair play. There was no fair play,\\" while the Netherlands' Marco van Basten responded, \\"If you talk about fair play, you should watch yourself first... [Portugal was] a bit more experienced with all these tricks and all this time wasting.\\" Ivanov criticized both teams, reportedly saying, \\"They are known for time wasting and hitting from behind. I was unpleasantly surprised by seeing such things from the Dutch. More so, they were the instigators.\\" In the 7th minute, Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo left the match with an injury after being tackled in the thigh by Khalid Boulahrouz. International Herald Tribune writer Rob Hughes wrote that he had not seen \\"a more cynical and brutal attempt to kick a player out of a match than what [Boulahrouz] did to [Ronaldo],\\" and that he should have been red carded on two occasions, but only received a yellow card. Boulahrouz was sent off in the 63rd minute after receiving his second yellow card for an elbow to Lu√≠s Figo's face. In the 60th minute, Figo received a yellow card despite head-butting Dutchman Mark van Bommel, usually a red card offence, as stated by Law 12 of \\"The Laws of Football\\" ‚Äì \\"A player shall be sent off if he/she is guilty of violent conduct.\\" Figo did not receive further sanctions and was cleared to play in the subsequent quarter-final match against England as he had been shown the yellow card during the match. Van Bommel said of the decision, \\"Figo head butted me and that is not a yellow card. I blame the referee, it was a clear red card.\\" = Italy vs. France (Final) = Zinedine Zidane converted a controversial penalty and was sent off for a headbutt in the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final Zinedine Zidane opened the scoring in the 7th minute by converting a controversial penalty spot kick, which glanced off the underside of the crossbar and into the goal. The penalty was awarded after Florent Malouda went down inside the Italian penalty area under a challenge from Italian defender Marco Materazzi. The call was somewhat controversial‚Äîas it was put by an Associated Press report posted in the ESPN website \\"Malouda stumbled ‚Äì many might say dived ‚Äì in the penalty area and Elizondo immediately signaled a penalty kick\\". However, the slow-motion replay proved the referee right. Italy then equalized at the 19th minute with a header by Materazzi himself and went on to win the title on penalty shoot out. The controversy surrounding the penalty was however overshadowed by the discussion surrounding Zinedine Zidane's sending off by the end of extra-time for headbutting the Italian player in the chest. = General concerns with officiating less-prominent teams = Match referees have faced accusations of bias from the media and team representatives for allegedly favouring larger and better-established teams at the finals, at the expense of less established football nations. After the Australian team was knocked out of the tournament as a result of a controversial penalty given against defender Lucas Neill in their Second round match against Italy, Australian assistant coach Graham Arnold was quoted as saying, \\"We are a small footballing nation that gets no favours. All we ask for is a fair go, and I don't think we received it over the four games.\\" Likewise, after going down to Brazil in their second round match, Ghana's head coach Ratomir Dujkoviƒá stated that \\"the referee might as well have been wearing a yellow shirt under his own\\". One basis for these claims has been the irregular balance of fouls sanctioned by referees between traditional powers and emerging teams. As of 27 June, the top eight seeded teams have a combined net surplus of 93 more fouls sustained than committed with an average of 3.1 per match, according to statistics published on FIFA's website. On average, as of 27 June, the team with the highest fouls count of the finals have been debutants; Ghana, with a 1.95 ratio between fouls committed and fouls sustained, Tunisia with a ratio of 1.76 fouls committed/sustained, and Australia with a 1.75 ratio. By contrast, the teams with fewer fouls committed have been traditional powerhouses Italy, Brazil and Spain ‚Äì with respective averages of 0.66, 0.67 and 0.75 in fouls committed/sustained ratios. On the other hand, the teams that committed the least fouls (less than 50 in three games) were Trinidad and Tobago, Costa Rica, C√¥te d'Ivoire, South Korea, Paraguay, Poland and Japan (the latter with just 38 fouls). Also, of the 5 teams most judged wrongly offside, four were in \\"Pot A\\", which therefore seeds them in the top 8 (Italy, Argentina, France and Brazil) and the other emerging European side Ukraine. Of the teams that were judged to be in an offside position incorrectly on no occasion in the first three games, only one (Mexico) was seeded into \\"Pot A\\". While these statistics could be used to support claims of bias, they could also indicate that some teams are rougher and that the stronger teams are more disciplined, and their success is due to their not committing excessive fouls. Additionally it should be considered that a team in possession is more likely to sustain a foul than a defending team, and therefore the successful teams are likely to sustain more fouls. FIFA president Sepp Blatter told before the tournament that referees should protect big star players: \\"What has been clearly said to referees is 'please protect the physical integrity of the players', and that means protecting the big stars\\". = Defence of referees = On summing up the progress of the tournament at the conclusion of the group stage, Sepp Blatter spoke in defence of FIFA's officiating in the tournament, stating \\"... referees are only human, and they make mistakes. We have to reduce the number of mistakes, but we're all still searching in vain for perfection.\\" Despite Blatter's statement, both Ivanov and Poll, referees at the center of the two largest controversies, were not included on the twelve-team list of officials selected by FIFA to referee the final eight matches of the competition.  Player disputes  =Togo= Following months of confusion over who would be managing the African debutants Togo, Otto Pfister was only confirmed in the job the day before their opening match against South Korea. Pfister had previously resigned as coach of the team. The players threatened to boycott the final group match against France due to pay disputes. Discipline Certain matches attracted attention due to the high number of cards. The Italy ‚Äì USA match had three red cards with De Rossi of Italy in particular given marching orders for elbowing an opponent. This match was second only to the encounter between the Netherlands and Portugal (which had four, as well as 16 yellows). A Croatian player was also sent off after having (mistakenly) been given three yellow cards by referee Graham Poll. Fan issues Some Dutch fans were forced to take off their trousers branded with the logo of Bavaria beer, as Budweiser was the official beer of the tournament.INSIDER World Cup Diary - Bavaria Repeats Ambush Marketing; N.Korea Fans Watched. June 16, 2010.Scramble for sponsorship for 2010, When Saturday Comes. Rather than leave the stadium, they proceeded to watch the match in their underclothes. Crime =Hooliganism= While the German Police expressed satisfaction in their ability to contain and deal with hooliganism, speculation was rife that a number of potential flashpoints existed which could cause widespread public disorder. With a number of routes into the country, amongst them the open land borders which are a consequence of the Schengen agreement, apprehension of known troublemakers and organisers of disturbances looked to be a very real problem. However, during the World Cup, Germany suspended its rules granting passport-free travel to EU citizens. As an illustration of this, on 8 June, German police apprehended 9 English hooligans attempting to enter the country via the Czech border. Britain has a particularly stringent policy of restricting foreign travel of known football hooligans during periods where the England team are involved. 3,500 banning orders were served, and by 8 June all but 150 had surrendered their passports. On 9 June Channel 4 News in the UK reported that although there had been no violence, England fans in Frankfurt had been kicking footballs at the windows of the city's 600-year-old R√∂mer city hall building, although local police decided not to take action over this minor incident and the staff at the Mayor's office apparently took the attempted vandalism in good humour. On the day of England's first match against Paraguay two England fans were arrested for having swastikas and SS insignia painted on their bodies. The two were flown back to England to appear in court; one was found guilty and banned from attending football matches until 2008, while the other was not banned as the symbol (the double-sig rune of the SS) was painted on his back, and he may not have been able to see it or known what it was. The court heard that the fan found guilty also had a letter J on his arm, believed to be a slight to Jews, but claimed not to know its meaning. There was also concern over hooligans among the 300,000 Polish fans who travelled to Germany for the tournament.About 300,000 Poles may go to finals, says minister, Reuters, 6 June 2006 This supposition was borne out as clashes between rival groups of supporters culminated in the arrest of 429 prior to and in the wake of the game between Germany and Poland in Dortmund.Aktuelle Nachrichten ‚Äì Inland Ausland Wirtschaft Kultur Sport ‚Äì ARD Tagesschau On 14 June, ITV news in the UK reported that up to that date 7 England fans had been arrested, one for a \\"serious offence\\". =Racism= It was claimed that \\"foreign-looking\\" people should not visit some areas in the former East Germany,\\"Neo-Nazis ready to crash World Cup\\" MSNBC.

Other far-right marches were planned for Frankfurt and Herne during the competition, although these were subsequently banned. FIFA announced that at the World Cup, teams could have points deducted for racist remarks by players and officials. A \\"Football Against Racism\\" logo covered each field's center circle until kickoff at all World Cup matches. Prior to every quarter-final match, the captains read a \\"declaration against racism\\" over the PA system. The European Union launched a campaign against racism before the World Cup. Friso Roscam Abbing, spokesman for the EU Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner indicated that the campaign also targeted prostitution rings and human trafficking. =Trafficking of women= Some international human rights groups (like the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), the Nordic Council and Amnesty International) expressed concern that there would be an increase in the trafficking of women up to and during the World Cup. PACE and Amnesty claimed that 30,000 women and girls might become the subject of slavery for the purposes of forced prostitution during the World Cup.

He graduated in biology from Fergusson College of the University of Pune in 1963, and secured a master's degree in zoology from the Mumbai University in 1965. = Harvard years = Gadgil was encouraged to join Harvard University by Giles Mead, then curator of fishes at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology. Initially intending to do research under Mead, Gadgil later changed subjects by hearing lectures of E. O. Wilson, \\"the brightest young star in the ecology-evolution end of biology at Harvard at that time,\\" and subsequently did his doctoral research on mathematical ecology and fish behaviour, under the guidance of William Bossert, one of Wilson's former students. It earned him a PhD in 1969. Subsequently, he received a Fellowship from IBM to continue his work as a research fellow at the Harvard Computing Center and simultaneously worked as a lecturer of biology at the university for two years. = Return to India = He returned to India in 1971 and took up a job as a scientific officer at Agharkar Research Institute of the Maharashtra Association for Cultivation of Science, Pune where he stayed for two years. In 1973, he joined the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, starting an association that would stretch for over thirty years, superannuating from the institute as its chairman in 2004. During this period, he established two research centres at IISc, the Centre of Theoretical Studies and the Centre for Ecological Studies. He also worked as a visiting professor at Stanford University (1991) and the University of California, Berkeley (1995). After his retirement from IISc, he went back to Pune in 2004 to resume his association with Agharkar Research Institute and holds the Damodar Dharmanand Kosambi chair of the visiting research professor at the University of Goa. In 1976, when the Government of Karnataka decided to look into protecting the bamboo resources of the state, Gadgil was asked to conduct a study, which is reported to have influenced the government to curb the subsidies provided to forest based industries. A decade later, in 1986, he was appointed as a member of the Scientific Advisory Council to Prime Minister of India, a post he held till 1990. During this period, he assisted the efforts to establish the first biosphere reserve in the country at the Nilgiris in 1986. In 1998, he was appointed the chairman of the Science and Technology Advisory Panel of Global Environment Facility, an agency under the United Nations. He held the chair till 2002. He also served as a member of the environmental education panel of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and as a member of the National Advisory Council. He is a member of the National Tiger Conservation Authority and is the chairman of the committee proposing Environmental Education Curriculum at School level. In 2010, when the Government of India constituted an expert panel, Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP), to examine the ecological issues related to the Western Ghats, he was selected as the chairman of the panel.  Personal life  Gadgil, an active sportsman during his college years, held the Maharashtra State Junior and Pune University high jump records in 1959 and 1961 respectively. He has also represented Pune University at the All India University Athletic meet. He is married to Sulochana Gadgil, a noted meteorologist and a Harvard scholar, whom he met during his Harvard years. The couple has a daughter, who is a journalist cum Spanish teacher, and a son, a mathematician. The family lives in Pune, his home town. His life story has been recorded in a biographical book, Vidnyanyatri ‚Äì Dr. Madhav Gadgil, written in Marathi by A. P. Deshpande.  Legacy  Nilgiris Biosphere Reserve Poomparai village in the foothills of Western Ghats. One of the major contributions of Gadgil is his effort towards the preservation of ecology of India. His early researches in the 1980s have helped in the identification of the Nilgiris as the first biosphere reserve in India. As the chairman of the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP), which later came to be known as the Gadgil Commission, he submitted a report in 2011, marking around 64 percent of the Western Ghats region as Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA). The report attracted support and dissension, the environmentalists welcoming the recommendations and the state governments of the neighbouring states and the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church of Kerala disapproving it. This paved way for the subsequent Kasturirangan Commission, which diluted the recommendations to a level more acceptable to the state governments. He has been credited by many with the introduction of quantitative investigations of ecology and animal behaviour in India and for including humans as a vital part of ecosystems. His contributions, as a member of the draft committee, has been reported in the preparation of the Biological Diversity Act 2002 and the manual he prepared for the People's Biodiversity Registers has been accepted by the National Biodiversity Authority. He is still associated with the Authority in the preparation of a biodiversity inventory at the local bodies' level. Gadgil is known to have done extensive researches in the areas of population biology, conservation biology, human ecology and ecological history. His researches have been documented by over 250 scientific articles, published in various journals and magazines. He developed a penchant for writing at an early age and his first publication was a series of ten articles on animal behaviour, published in Srishtidnyan, a Marathi language science magazine, when he was studying in the 10th standard. His doctoral thesis is reported to have been a citation classic. He published his first book in English, This Fissured Land, a book on the ecological history of India, in 1992. The next book, Ecology and Equity: The Use and Abuse of Nature in Contemporary India, again co-authored by Ramachandra Guha, was released in 1995, followed by Nurturing Biodiversity: An Indian Agenda, a book co-authored by P. R. Seshagiri Rao, in 1998. In 2005, he published two books, Diversity : The cornerstone of life and Ecological Journeys. As a part of his responsibilities as a Pew Fellow in Conservation and the Environment, he has contributed towards the preparation of People's Biodiversity Registers and has published a manual, People's Biodiversity Registers: A Methodology Manual. Some of his books have been translated into many languages and serve as texts for academic studies. He has also published two books, Nisarganiyojan Lokasahabhagane being one among them, and over 40 articles in Marathi and handled a fortnightly column on natural history, in The Hindu, from 1999 till 2004. He handles a monthly column in the Marathi daily, Sakal. ;Books   Madhav Gadgil (2013), Science, democracy and ecology in India. Nehru Memorial Museum & Library  Awards and recognition  Dr. Madhav Gadgil and Col. Ashwin Baindur at Wikidata workshop in Pune on 18 September 2017 The Indian National Science Academy (INSA) elected him as their Fellow in 1984. Six years later, the two other major science academies of India, The Indian Academy of Sciences (IAS) and the National Academy of Sciences, India (NASI), followed suit by electing him as a Fellow in 1990. He is Fellow of the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS), an honorary Fellow of the Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation (ATBC) and a recipient of the National Environment Fellowship of the Ministry of Environment and Forests for his field research in the Western Ghats. He was elected as a Foreign Associate of the US National Academy of Sciences in 1991 and he serves as a member of the British Ecological Society and Ecological Society of America. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri in 1981 and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), an autonomous government agency awarded him Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, the highest Indian award in the Science and Technology sector, in 1986. In between, in 1983, the Government of Karnataka honoured him with Rajyotsava Prashasthi, their second highest civilian award. His alma mater, Harvard University, presented him with the Harvard Centennial Medal, an annual honour given to its alumni for their achievements in their respective field of service, in 2002. The next year, he shared the 2003 Volvo Environment Prize of the Volvo Environment Prize Foundation, with Muhammad Yunus, the social entrepreneur from Bangladesh. Gadgil received the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian award from the Government of India in 2006 and the H. K. Firodia award of the H. K. Firodia Foundation reached him a year later, in 2007. The Central University of Orissa honoured him with the degree of Doctor of Science (Honoris Causa) in 2013 and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) recognised the contributions of the Western Ghats Ecology Experts Panel (WGEEP) and its chairman with the Georgescu-Roegen Award in 2014. The University of Southern California awarded him the John and Alice Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement in 2015, which he shared with Jane Lubchenco, a Distinguished Professor of Oregon State University, making him the second Indian, after M. S. Swaminathan, to receive the Prize. He is also a recipient of the Vikram Sarabhai Award and Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar Award. He received the Fergusson Gaurav Puraskar 2019, for being an Outstanding Alumnus from his Alma Mater, Fergusson College on 6 January 2019.

Plot After a routine health inspection, the inspector, Mr. Carnegie, after an exhaustive listing of problems in the kitchen, informs Basil and Sybil that Fawlty Towers is below standard, with the flaws including the presence of two dead pigeons in the water tank. He will, therefore, recommend closure to the Council if they do not rectify the problems within 24 hours. The staff all get to work straight away. When Basil is alerting Manuel, he notices that he is keeping a pet rat, having been conned into thinking that it's a Siberian hamster. Basil, afraid that the health inspector will take issue with it, removes it. Infuriated, Manuel threatens to resign, and it is debated what to do with it. Eventually, it is agreed that it will be moved to a friend of Polly, but she and Manuel secretly hide it in a shed nearby. Foolishly, Manuel lets it out to exercise, and it escapes back into the hotel, prompting a discreet rat hunt. Unfortunately, Basil learns of it from the Major, who had tried to shoot it, and decides to join in the hunt after a confrontation (\\"Let's have a little Basil hunt, shall we? And then we can deal with the sackings later on\\"). During the search, Basil applies rat poison to a veal fillet and puts it on the floor in the kitchen. Just as Carnegie arrives, the Major sees the rat and shoots at it. Basil silences him (by jabbing him in the groin with the butt of the gun) and persuades him to say his target was a starling. Manuel, while asking about his rat, whose name is \\"Basil\\", is informed that the chef puts a lot of basil in the ratatouille. Panicking (\\"He put Basil in the ratatouille?!\\"), Manuel runs into the kitchen, only to be informed by Terry that \\"I haven't made any bleedin' ratatouille!\\" In the commotion, a tray of veal is spilled, and the poisoned cutlet is picked up as well by an unknowing Terry. To make matters worse, every subsequent guest asks for veal, including Mr. Carnegie, who has decided to stay for lunch after declaring the hotel to once again be in satisfactory condition. Unable to persuade him to try something else, or discern which veal is safe, they resort to using a piece the cat chewed, as it is not demonstrating signs of poisoning. Moments later, Basil retrieves it after he walks out the back and sees the cat choking, only to discover that the cat was, by extremely remarkable coincidence, throwing up a fur ball when Basil had seen it. Meanwhile, Manuel spots the rat at the table of an engaged young couple named Quentina and Ronald, and struggles to take their order. Basil is called over to explain Manuel's shock, and informs him that there is a bread roll under the table, ordering Manuel to get a box. Polly takes their order, and of course, they ask for veal. When Basil explains that the veal is off, only for them to see Sybil serve Carnegie his veal (which Basil claims is \\"veal substitute\\"), the couple decide to dine elsewhere, but Polly informs Basil that the rat is in Quentina's handbag. She catches him trying to fish it out, and he is only saved from a \\"bunch of fives\\" from an indignant Ronald after Polly says that there has been a bomb scare. Unfortunately, the rat bites Basil and escapes into the dining room. Manuel catches and hides it in the biscuit tin. When he turns around for a moment, the Major takes the box for a biscuit. Manuel does not see this and frantically searches for the box. Carnegie finishes lunch and asks for some coffee, cheese and biscuits for afters. The Major unknowingly hands Polly the box containing the rat. On opening the lid, the rat's head pops up and looks directly into Mr Carnegie's face. Carnegie is speechless, especially when Basil asks \\"would you care for a rat, or...?\\" Polly removes the rat and returns to Carnegie, who is still dumbfounded by what he has seen, and not altogether certain that he did see it. Sybil ends the series with the line \\"I'm afraid it's started to rain again,\\" in an attempt to distract Carnegie as Manuel drags Basil, who has fainted off-screen, out of the dining room.

Fawlty Towers began in September 1975, two months before the death of Franco, the Spanish dictator. * In some shots a real rat was used. The real rat's appearances in studio shot scenes were pre-recorded due to fears it could run into the studio audience.Fawlty Towers: Reopened The last shot of Basil the Rat at the reveal is of an obvious puppet in a biscuit tin operated by Connie Booth. * Manuel's pet \\"hamster\\" was previously mentioned in \\"The Germans\\", but not seen. Similarly, Basil and Sybil have a pet cat which is mentioned in \\"The Hotel Inspectors\\" (Basil: \\"Well he's [Manuel] useless isn't he, you may as well ask the cat\\") but is first seen here. * Manuel was seen to play the guitar in \\"Gourmet Night\\", but he does not do it very well. In this episode, he appears to have improved. * In the scene where Polly and Manuel are seen taking the rat away from the hotel, the accompanying music is the second movement of the Concierto de Aranjuez by Spanish composer Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo. Coincidentally a version of this piece by Manuel and his Music of the Mountains (a pseudonym for bandleader Geoff Love) had been a chart hit in the UK in 1976. * Melody Lang (Mrs. Taylor) was the real-life wife of Andrew Sachs. * This episode was filmed and broadcast six months after the previous episode due to a BBC strike. * This is John Cleese's personal favourite episode. Stage adaptation In 1994, \\"Basil The Rat\\" was one of two Fawlty Towers episodes that were adapted for the stage and performed at the Theatre Geo in Hollywood.

Its offices are in Goleta, California. The telescopes are located at both northern and southern hemisphere sites distributed in longitude around the Earth. For some astronomical objects, the longitudinal spacing of telescopes allows continuous observations over 24 hours or longer. The operating network currently consists of two 2 meter telescopes, nine 1 meter telescopes, and seven 40 cm telescopes, placed at six astronomical observatories. The network operates as a single, integrated, observing facility, using a software scheduler that continuously optimizes the planned observing schedule of each individual telescope. History Rosing incorporated Las Cumbres Observatory in 1993 with the goal of aiding universities, observatories, and individuals in the acquisition and improvement of telescopes, optics, and instrumentation. He also set the objective for the organization to build and implement a global telescope system. In 2005, Rosing established the global telescope version of Las Cumbres Observatory. LCO initially acquired the two Faulkes 2 meter telescopes. Faulkes Telescope North (FTN) located at Haleakala Observatory, on Maui, Hawaii, and Faulkes Telescope South (FTS) at Siding Spring Observatory (SSO), in eastern Australia. LCO also purchased the company that built the Faulkes telescopes, Telescope Technologies Limited of Liverpool, with the intent of installing additional 2-meter telescopes at different sites to form a robotically operated network. Over the next few years, Rosing and the LCO staff came to understand that a network composed of many smaller telescopes would provide greater observing capacity. The organization designed its own 1 meter telescope with a plan to locate several of these at each chosen site. An even smaller 40 cm telescope was also developed primarily for use in education projects. During 2012 and 2013, nine 1 meter telescopes were constructed and deployed to McDonald Observatory at Fort Davis, Texas; Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO) in Chile; South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO), near Sutherland, South Africa; and SSO in Australia. During 2015 and 2016, seven 40 cm telescopes were deployed to CTIO, Haleakala Observatory, SSO, and to Teide Observatory on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. After completion of the construction and installation of these telescopes, LCO began its transition to operating a global observatory. In 2013, a Board of Directors was established and a President was hired to lead the organization. Full science scheduling began on 1 May 2014, with the two 2 meter and nine 1 meter telescopes operating as a single, integrated, observatory. The 40 cm telescopes were added to this system as they were commissioned. The National Science Foundation made an award to LCO in 2016 through its Mid-Scale Innovations Program, purchasing access to the LCO network for all astronomers at U.S. institutions. The goal of this program is to prepare this community to carry out effective research following discoveries being made by current and future time domain astronomy surveys. Telescope network =Sites= LCO operates its network at seven sites. The operating sites are all professional astronomical observatories. In the southern hemisphere: * Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO) in Chile * South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO), near Sutherland, South Africa * Siding Spring Observatory (SSO), in eastern Australia LCOGT commissioning at McDonald Observatory LCOGT 80 cm telescope enclosure at Sedgwick Reserve In the northern hemisphere: * McDonald Observatory at Fort Davis, Texas * Haleakala Observatory, on Maui, Hawaii * Teide Observatory on Tenerife in the Canary Islands The Ali Observatory in western Tibet will be added as the telescopes there become operational. LCO also operates an identical 1 meter telescope at its headquarters in Goleta for engineering development and a 0.8 meter telescope at Sedgwick Reserve near Santa Ynez, California. =Telescopes= LCO 2 m Faulkes Telescope North LCO 1 m Telescope prototype at Santa Barbara LCO 40 cm Telescope prototype at Santa Barbara The 2 meter telescopes are the two Faulkes telescopes built by Telescope Technologies Ltd. They are f/10 Ritchey- Chr√©tien optical configurations on alt-az mounts. The 1 meter telescopes are f/7.95 Ritchey-Chr√©tien optical systems on equatorial mounts. They have a 50 arcminute-diameter fully corrected field of view. The telescopes use the optics and tubes from Meade 16 inch RCX telescopes. The mount has been replaced by a scaled-down version of the LCO 1 meter telescope mount. =Instruments= The 2 meter telescopes are instrumented with optical imagers and low-resolution optical spectrographs (FLOYDS). The 1 meter telescopes are instrumented with ‚ÄúSinistro‚Äù optical imagers that have a 26 arcminute square field of view. During 2017, a set of high-resolution (R = 50,000), high- stability spectrographs (NRES) were deployed to four of the LCO sites to be coupled by optical fibres to the 1 meter telescopes. The telescopes are equipped with SBIG STX-6303 optical imagers. =Operation= The global telescope network operates as a single observatory. Users request observations only for a generic class of telescope/instrument and the software scheduler determines an optimum observing schedule for each telescope. The scheduler revises the observing schedules for all telescopes as necessary and updates can be provided within 15 minutes. The rapid-response request mode bypasses the scheduler and can begin an observation within a few minutes after submission. Each telescope carries out a nightly calibration program and adjusts its pointing and focus several times per night. The telescopes are all instrumented uniformly to facilitate the combining of data from multiple telescopes or sites. Data are returned to LCO headquarters, where they are processed to remove instrumental signature and ingested into an archive. Users have immediate access to their observations and all data are made public after 12 months. Usage The network is available to researchers at institutions that are members of the LCO science collaboration. Institutions that operate the sites hosting the LCO telescopes and a few institutions that have contributed resources to help build the network are members of the collaboration. The entire U.S. astronomical community gained access to the LCO network in 2016 as a result of an award from the National Science Foundation's Mid-Scale Innovation Program. The program is administered through a peer- review proposal process run by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory. Several science teams and individuals also purchase time on the LCO network. Research The design and operation of the LCO global telescope network provide the unique capabilities required for time domain astronomy. The LCO network offers the ability to observe objects or events continuously and the ability to obtain data rapidly upon the discovery or announcement of an event. The LCO network has been used to study supernovae and other explosive transients; exoplanets, through observations of both transits and microlensing; asteroids; and AGN variability. In 2017 LCO played a critical part in two major discoveries: first visible counterpart of a gravitational wave event, and a new type of supernova with successive explosions. Education Since the beginning of LCO, education has been one of its core missions. In 2017, for the first time in LCO's history it issued an open call for education partners, Global Sky Partners‚Äîgroups who could use their robotic telescopes to inspire diverse audiences with educational and outreach projects that they support. In 2019 there are 20 LCO Global Sky Partnershttps://lco.global/education/partners based in the US, Europe, Sub- Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Australia, or running entirely online programs, for students, teachers, and the wider public. The LCO education team also maintains in-house educational programs to trigger observations and make use of data from the LCO network. These programs are designed to inspire anyone with an interest in astronomy to explore science using robotic telescopes.

In 1676, Dahlbergh was made director-general of fortifications for the Realm of Sweden. After the fleet moved to Karlskrona in 1680, the castle fell into disrepair Kastellet exploded in June 1845 and subsequently was built 1846-1848 to the design of military officer and architect Fredrik Blom (1781‚Äì1853). It consists of a round tower with red brick walls and a stair tower. The castle regained its defensive function during World War II when it became part of Stockholm's permanent air defense. The tower and battery plane were then equipped with fast-firing anti-aircraft guns. The Swedish Coastal Artillery training school departed Kastellet in 1990. On the top of the Kastellet, the Military Ensign of Sweden is hoisted and lowered every day, indicating the nation is at peace.

Mold√∏en with its trading privileges was owned by a number of succeeding families such as Fester, Glad, Friis, Knoph, Schmidt and Lem until the area was expropriated by the municipality for development. The town has since spread onto the island of V√•gs√∏y, where the majority of the town is now located, and in recent decades onto the mainland. During World War II, Mold√∏en was the site of a German coastal fort. Operation Archery took place on and around the island, and during the fighting, all the island's original buildings were destroyed. Today, the island is connected to M√•l√∏y by a land- filled causeway and is the site of a park featuring the remains of the German fort, two memorials of World War II and a disc golf course. The island also has a modern rope and trawl factory, a large freeze warehouse, and an ISPS port. The island is also the base for several pillars that support the M√•l√∏y Bridge which connects the island of V√•gs√∏y to the mainland.

The Cosmic Puppets is a science fiction novel by American author Philip K. Dick, published in 1957. It is a revision of A Glass of Darkness, first published in the December 1956 issue of Satellite Science Fiction. The Cosmic Puppets was first published as a novel by Ace Books as one half of Ace Double D-249, bound dos-√†-dos with Sargasso of Space by Andrew North (better known as Andre Norton).  Plot summary  Ted Barton, having left Millgate, Virginia several years ago, returns with his wife Peg to find his hometown strangely transformed. Street names and landmarks do not exist as he remembers them, and the inhabitants of the town are similarly oblivious to their contradictory past. Peg proves intolerant of her husband's interest and abandons him while he explores the town. While in Millgate, Barton meets three sympathetic locals: Doctor Meade, a family physician; his daughter, Mary; and William Christopher, a town drunk. However, Mary has a menacing counterpart‚ÄîPeter Trilling, the deceptively young offspring of the town's hotel owner. After Barton's departure from Millgate is blocked by a permanently jackknifed logging truck obstructing the only route out of town, he discovers that Christopher remembers the town's erased past. Christopher recalls an event entitled \\"the Change\\", which occurred eighteen years beforehand, after Barton had left Millgate. In his previous life he was an electrician but is now working to revert Millgate to its previous state of existence. Dr. Meade and Mary have the same agenda, as Meade's \\"Shady House\\" patients turn out to be \\"Wanderers\\", incorporeal former inhabitants of the erased Millgate who can communicate with Mary and certain others. Barton is able to revert objects, as well as an erased park, at which point Mary discloses that she is also aware of the Change and the prior Millgate. Mary and Peter are in fact engaged in a low-intensity supernatural proxy war against one another. She can only use bees, moths, cats and flies against his control over golems, spiders, snakes and rats, and initially seems to kill Mary through his servitors. However, even this traumatic event is not enough to cause Dr. Meade to abandon the comforting illusion of his false human identity. Two vast, supernatural entities loom over Millgate, however, and Barton realises that Meade is one of them, as Peter Trilling reverts to his own, malignant divine self. He uses his servitors to attack Barton, Christopher and the Wanderers, but is stopped as Meade remembers his past, and reassumes his own divine identity. At the denouement, Millgate finds itself in the crossfire of a battle between the twin but diametrically opposed demigods, Ahriman (the \\"destructive spirit\\") and Ormazd (the \\"creator\\") of Zurvanism. Ormazd eventually triumphs, and Mary reveals her own true identity as Ormazd's messianic daughter, Armaiti, who arranged for Barton's exile and return to the town when it was time to overthrow Ahriman's false illusion. The former Millgate returns to solidity, Christopher resumes his career as an electrician forgetting the Change ever occurred, and Barton leaves the town, having restored the \\"true\\" nature of the community to what it was.

At the time of the 1789 convening of the Estates-General, he was elected as a deputy for the Third Estate from Nancy, where he had been a prominent member of the commercial bourgeoisie. A \\"constitutionalist,\\" he repeatedly expressed concern that France be governed by a collaboration between king and legislative body. For instance, in the May 1790 debate on the right to declare war/peace, he argued that allowing the king to do so alone would \\"compromise liberty,\\" whereas giving the right to the Assembly alone would be \\"to lose the monarchy, and replace it not with democracy, but aristocracy.\\" When the Constituent Assembly dissolved itself, Duquesnoy returned to Lorraine where he was elected mayor of Nancy. Denounced as a monarchist, he was arrested during the Terror, released, arrested again, and again released. Under Napoleon, he was named to the Legion of Honor and served as mayor of the 10th arrondissement of Paris. Having lost the support of Napoleon and suffered significant business losses, he committed suicide in 1808.

Lower left, see double moutza, lower middle, see single moutza A mountza or moutza ( or ) also called faskeloma ( ) is the most traditional gesture of insult among Greeks. It consists of extending and spreading all fingers of the hand and presenting the palm towards the face of the person to be insulted with a forward motion. It is often coupled with (, \\"here\\"), (, \\"there you are\\"), or (, \\"take these\\") and swear words. The closer the gesture is to the other person's face the more threatening it is considered. An even more offensive version is achieved by using both hands to double the gesture, smacking the palm of one hand against the back of the other in the direction of the intended recipient.This can be seen at 0:26 in an advertisement for Aegean Airlines. When Greeks hand-signal the number 5 to someone they take care not to overextend the fingers or face their palm towards the person, lest it be mistaken for a mountza.  Origin  The origin of the gesture can be traced back to the ancient years, when it was used as a curse. It is said that even during the Eleusinian Mysteries it complemented verbal curses against evil forces. It was then called () which survives today, along with its variant (), still survive as synonyms of mountza. In later years, the name changed to mountza. In the penal code of the Byzantine Empire one punishment entailed criminals paraded around town sitting backwards on a donkey with their face smeared with cinder (, ) to enhance their ridicule. Because cinder was wiped on the person's face first by collecting it in the palm and then by extending open the fingers, the gesture itself became insulting, to be known as mountza, after the name of the material applied. The modern Greek word mountzoura or moutzoura for a smudge, scribble or dark stain has the same origin. Around the world The gesture of mountza does not have the same significance in other cultures around the world. In a few countries there are similar gestures. Their significances are: *In Armenia, abruptly thrusting the palm of the hand to someone means \\"Curse you\\", but can also mean \\"Can't stand you anymore\\" if performed by a close female relative or friend (mostly mother or grandmother). *In Iraqi and Assyrian culture, abruptly pushing the palm of the hand towards someone means they are worthy of shame and are dishonorable. *In Sindh, the showing of the palm to someone in a thrusting manner is also considered an insult. This gesture is called bunda. *In the Persian Gulf, showing the palms of both hands to someone after clapping them is also considered an insult, together with saying Malat Alaik. It is usually done by women as it is considered not manly if men do it. *Since the 1990s in North America, a similar gesture is used in \\"Talk to the hand\\". By showing the palm of the hand, with fingers spread, and saying \\"Talk to the hand... because the face ain't listenin is the equivalent of \\"You're wasting your breath\\" or \\"Shut up\\". Even before then, a common expression of displeasure was to \\"throw\\" one's hand. *In Mexico, it can be used to say hi (together with waving); but when steady or moving it repeatedly towards the receiver means \\"You'll see!\\" (Spanish: Vas a ver/Ya ver√°s/Ya lo ver√°s), warning that the giver will tell an authority figure (parent, teacher, principal, etc...) about any prank or other mischievous action the receiver has done. It is commonly used with children to scare them into behaving. *In Nigeria, this can be viewed as offensive in particular tribes and is usually accompanied with the use of the expletive waka, meaning \\"your father\\". (This is wrong. Waka does not mean your father but can be directed as in extending the insult to ones father as in ‚ÄúWaka! Your father!‚Äù) The origin of the word and its meaning in Nigeria is disputed but could possibly be Hausa. *In Panama, in addition to meaning the same as in Mexico, it is also used to threaten the receiver (implying that they will be punished or be the target of violence or any other form of retribution) at a later and more appropriate/convenient time (often when there is less risk of getting caught in the case of physical retribution or attack). This is because aside from implying/saying the words Vas a ver! to the receiver, the word Esp√©rate (colloq. P√©rate) meaning wait, is also used often since the gesture also has the general meaning of wait/hold on as in many other parts of the world. *In Chicago, the moutza was used on a mock \\"city sticker\\" in 2012 following a controversy over design ideas for an official city parking sticker honoring first responders. In the spoof sticker, the moutza is displayed with the middle finger cut off to represent Chicago's mayor, Rahm Emanuel, who lost part of his middle finger while cutting roast beef in high school.

His name was Promised Road, and he was typical of the type of horse that needs someone's help and a caring home. He was then 9, an undistinguished campaigner whose career ended with a sixth-place finish in a $3,500 claiming race. There have been hundreds more like him who have come under the care of the TRF. Ron \\"Gibby\\" Gibson the trainer of Promised Road knew that the horse deserved to be taken care of in retirement as Promised Road took care of him while racing. Mr. Gibson went on to teach at the facility before retiring. The TRF is about more than helping horses in need. Early in the TRF's history, Founder and Chairman of the Board Monique S. Koehler negotiated a milestone agreement with the State of New York Department of Correctional Services. In exchange for land use and labor at the state's Wallkill Correctional Facility, the TRF would design, staff and maintain a vocational training program in equine care and management for inmates. Upon the completion of their sentences, many former inmates who have worked with the horses have gone on to become productive, solid citizens and have been quick to give credit to the TRF program. The inmates cannot have committed a sexual crime or first-degree murder. This unique prison program has been replicated at TRF farms located at the Blackburn Correctional Facility in Kentucky, Central Maryland Correctional Facility in Sykesville MD, Putnamville Correctional Facility in IN, Vandalia Correctional Facility in IL, Wateree River Correctional Institution in SC, James River Work Center in VA, and Plymouth County Sheriff's Farm in MA. The horses at these farms and several of our other facilities often are so infirm when retired from racing that they can do little more than enjoy their days in their paddocks and fields. However, hundreds of TRF horses have successfully been trained for second careers, as show jumpers, companion horses, handicapped riding horses, even polo horses. The Foundation says that the \\"sad truth is that a vast majority of the general public and even many racing fans are unaware of the sad fate that awaits thousands of Thoroughbreds each year. They assume each animal is assured a safe and graceful retirement once its racing days are over. Their perception of the \\"Sport of Kings\\" is one where great personal wealth and lifelong benevolence to all horses are givens. Unfortunately, it is a perception that does not reflect reality.\\" In 2001, the estate of the prominent horse owner/breeder Paul Mellon created a $5 million endowment for the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation for use in its efforts to rescue and rehabilitate retired race horses. The slaughterhouse killings of famous horses such as the U.S. Hall of Fame horse Exceller and the Kentucky Derby and Breeders' Cup Classic winner Ferdinand, both occurred outside the United States but helped raise awareness of what can happen to Thoroughbreds, even champions. The TRF also reminds people that the \\"reality is a Thoroughbred industry made up largely of owners with only modest resources and current economics that dictate that among all owners, no matter how responsible and well-intended, only a relatively few are capable of maintaining even a single Thoroughbred once it is unable to earn its keep on the track.\\" The TRF is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit tax-exempt organization entirely dependent on public contributions. Income is derived from donations from horse racing fans, owners, breeders, trainers and racing officials who believe racehorses deserve better than a trip to the slaughterhouse when their track careers are over. Legal troubles On March 18, 2011 a New York Times article reported that the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation \\"...has been so slow or delinquent in paying for the upkeep of the more than 1,000 horses under its care that scores have wound up starved and neglected, some fatally, according to interviews and inspection reports.\\" In November 2013, the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation settled a lawsuit with the attorney general of New York State that alleged the foundation mistreated animals in its herd. The settlement noted TRF denied any wrongdoing.

As of 2004, it was estimated that VOV programs reached more than 90% of all households in Vietnam.  History  Prior to 1945, the Vietnamese were banned from owning radio receivers, and broadcasting was under control of the French colonial government, which established the first radio station in Vietnam, Radio Saigon, in the late 1920s. Vietnam's national radio station, now called the Voice of Vietnam, started broadcasting from Hanoi just a week after the declaration of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with the declaration \\"This is the Voice of Vietnam, broadcasting from Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.\\" During the Vietnam War, Radio Hanoi operated as a propaganda tool of North Vietnam. In August 1968, Voice of Vietnam commenced shortwave broadcasts for Vietnamese living abroad. South Vietnam set up its own network in Saigon in 1955. Following Reunification, all of the radio stations were combined into the Voice of Vietnam, which became the national radio station in 1978.

He was the second son of Andrew II of Hungary and Gertrude of Merania. His father and Leszek the White, Duke of Poland, concluded an agreement about the marriage of Coloman and Leszek's daughter, Salomea, and the division of Halych, allotting its western regions to Leszek, the remaining lands to Coloman. The Hungarian and Polish armies occupied the principality in late 1214. Andrew II appointed a Hungarian nobleman, Benedict the Bald, to administer it on Coloman's behalf. Coloman was crowned the first king of Halych with the pope's authorization in early 1216. After the Hungarian troops occupied the western Galician territories, Leszek made an alliance with Mstislav Mstislavich, Prince of Novgorod. Mstislav invaded Halych, forcing Coloman and his supporters to flee to Hungary, most probably in early 1219. Mstislav supported his son-in-law, Daniel Romanovichwho had claimed Halych since 1205to invade Polish territories, which brought about a reconciliation between Andrew II and Leszek. The Hungarians and Poles again occupied Halych and restored it to Coloman in the autumn of 1219. Mstislav and his Cuman allies defeated the Hungarians near Halych and captured Coloman and Salomea in August 1221. To secure their release, Andrew II renounced Halych and arranged a marriage alliance between his youngest son, Andrew, and Mstislav's daughter. Coloman returned to Hungary in late 1221 or 1222. He settled in Szepes (now Spi≈° in Slovakia) where he had held large estates since the late 1210s. Andrew II made him duke of Slavonia, with jurisdiction also in Croatia and Dalmatia, in 1226. He cooperated with his eldest brother, B√©la, in revising their father's donations already during Andrew II's lifetime. Early life Coloman was the second son of Andrew II of Hungary and his first wife, Gertrude of Merania. Andrew's father (Coloman's grandfather), B√©la III of Hungary, was the first king of Hungary to conquer the Principality of Halych in 1188. B√©la granted Halych to the teenager Andrew, but Andrew was unpopular, especially because his troops did not respect the Galicians' Orthodox faith. The Galicians expelled him in 1189 or 1190, but he did not abandon his claim to Halych. After Roman Mstislavich, who had united the principalities of Volhynia and Halych under his rule, died fighting against the Poles in 1205, Andrew launched a military campaign against Halych in almost each year. He adopted the title of \\"King of Galicia and Lodomeria\\" in token of his claim to both principalities. Initially, he supported Roman Mstislavich's minor sons, Daniel and Vasilko Romanovich, against Vladimir Igorevich and his brothers, who also claimed Halych. Coloman was born in 1208. According to historians M√°rta Font and G√°bor Barab√°s, he was named most probably for Coloman of Stockerau, an Irish pilgrim who had been martyred in Austria in 1012. Coloman's mother showed blatant favoritism towards her German kinsmen and courtiers, which outraged the native lords. She was murdered by a group of Hungarian noblemen in September 1213, shortly after her husband departed for a new military campaign against Halych. Andrew returned to Hungary, but only after appointing a Galician boyar (or nobleman), Vladislav Kormilichich, to lead the Hungarian army to Halych. Kormilichich took control of the principality on Andrew's behalf. Leszek the White, Duke of Poland, granted asylum to Daniel and Vasilko Romanovich and made an alliance with princes Alexandr Vsevolodovich of Vladimir and Mstislav Yaroslavich of Peresopnytsia. They invaded Halych and routed Kormilichich, but they could not capture the capital of the principality. In a letter to Pope Innocent III, Andrew stated that Galician boyars had proposed him to grant Halych to Coloman. According to the Galician‚ÄìVolhynian Chronicle, Leszek the White was the first to suggest the same idea, also proposing his daughter, Salomea, to Coloman. Andrew and Leszek had a meeting in Szepes in the autumn of 1214.The Galician‚ÄìVolhynian Chronicle is the most important source of Coloman's rule in Halych; its variants narrate the events without a precise chronology, thus most dates of this period are un certain (Font & Barab√°s (2017), p. 13. They reached a compromise, which included the marriage of Coloman and Salomea and the cession of two western Galician towns, Przemy≈õl and Lubacz√≥w, to Leszek. The Hungarian and Polish armies invaded the principality and put an end to Vladislav Kormilichich's rule before the end of the year. Halych The Principality of Halych and its neighbors Coloman was installed in Halych soon after the fall of Kormilichich. Since Coloman was a minor, Benedict the Bald was appointed to administer the principality. Another Hungarian nobleman, Demetrius Aba, was made the master of the stewards in Coloman's court before 1216. Kormilichich's former ally, Sudislav, was the leading Galician boyars who supported Coloman. Andrew sent a letter to Pope Innocent, requesting him to authorize the John, Archbishop of Esztergom to anoint Coloman as king. In the next letter, Andrew thanked the pope for giving consent to Coloman's coronation, but also informed him that a riot had broken out against Coloman and the rebels laid siege to Halych. Andrew urged Innocent to send a legate and a golden crown to Coloman to strengthen the legitimacy of his rule. Pope Honorius III mentioned in a letter in 1222 that the Archbishop of Esztergom had crowned Coloman \\"with the blessing of the Holy See\\", but the circumstances of the ceremony are unknown. Historians Font, Barab√°s and Karol Holl√Ω inferred from the correspondence that Coloman was most probably crowned twice, first (in late 1214 or early 1215) with a provisional crown in Hungary, later (probably in early 1216) with the crown sent by the pope. Other historiansincluding Tibor Alm√°si, Nata≈°a Proch√°zkov√° and ƒêura Hardiconclude that Coloman was first anointed, and he was only once crowned, in early 1216. The relationship between Andrew and Leszek the White had meanwhile become tense. Leszek granted Vladimir-in-Vohynia, which was the most prestigious princely seat in Volhynia, to Daniel and Vasilko Romanovich. He also failed to support Coloman during the siege of Halych. The Hungarian army invaded western Galicia and captured Przemy≈õl and Lubacz√≥w in late 1215 or early 1216. Leszek approached Mstislav Mstislavich, Prince of Novgorod, seeking his assistance against the Hungarians. The reconstruction of the ensuing events is difficult, because their dating is uncertain. Mstislav invaded Halych between 1215 and 1219most probably in early 1219, according to Font and Barab√°sand forced Coloman, Benedict the Bald and Sudislav to flee to Hungary. Mstislav gave his daughter, Anna, in marriage to Daniel Romanovich who soon occupied the lands between the rivers Wieprz and Bug from Leszek. Outraged by Daniel's attack, Leszek made a new alliance with Andrew II. Their united forces defeated Mstislav's army in three battles in October 1219. Mstislav and Daniel were forced to abandon Halych and Coloman returned to the principality. Andrew most probably made Sudislav's son-in-law, File, the commander of the Hungarian army in Halych around this time, according to Font and Barab√°s. Mstislav hired Cumans and again invaded Halych in late 1220 or early 1221, but could not capture the capital. Mstislav's fiasco encouraged File to join Leszek's campaign against Volhynia, leaving Coloman and Salomea in the newly fortified Church of the Virgin Mary in Halych. Taking advantage of the absence of the bulk of the Hungarian army, Mstislav and the Cumans laid siege Halych in August 1221.Historian Martin Dimnik writes, Mstislav captured Coloman in both 1219 and 1221. (Dimnik (2003), pp. 290-291. File hurried back from his campaign, but Mstislav defeated his army and he could only flee with the help of a Galician boyar, Zhiroslav on 14 August. Coloman's retainers tried to resist in the fortified church, but the lack of water forced them to surrender. The Polish chronicler, Jan D≈Çugosz, wrote that Coloman and Salomea were imprisoned in the fortress of Torchesk. Internal strifes in Hungary prevented Coloman's father from launching a military expedition against Mstislav. Andrew entered into negotiations with Mstislav and they reached a compromise in late 1221 or early 1222. According to the agreement, Coloman was to renounce the title of King of Halych, but Mstislav agreed to give his daughter, Maria, in marriage to Coloman's younger brother, Andrew, to whom Coloman's royal title would be transferred. Kingdom of Hungary =Szepes= After his release in late 1221 or early 1222, Coloman returned to Hungary. His father soon approached Pope Honorius III, asking him to invalidate his agreement with Mstislav. The pope only cancelled the provision about the transfer of Coloman's royal title to his younger brother, because the pope preserved the right to decide about coronations. Coloman styled himself \\"King of Galicia\\" till the end of his life, although he never returned to Halych. He and his wife settled in Szepes, near the Hungarian-Galician border. Font and Barab√°s say that Coloman had received estates in the region already in the late 1210s. A late source (a 1279 letter of Elizabeth the Cuman) mentioned that Coloman had held Szepes till the end of his life. Coloman's activities in Szepes are poorly documented. He granted privileges to the \\"guest settlers\\" in Szepesolaszi (now Spi≈°sk√© Vlachy in Slovakia). He made donations to the Cistercian monastery which was established in the 1220s in Szepes. Coloman also supported the establishment of the Premonstratensian provostry at J√°sz√≥ (now Jasov in Slovakia). According to a scholarly theory, the tower of the Szepes Castle was built on Coloman's order. =Slavonia= Andrew II entrusted Coloman with the government of Slavonia, Croatia and Dalmatia in 1226. The three provinces had been administered by Coloman's elder brother, B√©la, who was appointed to administer Translyvania. Coloman's jurisdiction also included counties located in Hungary proper, such as Baranya, Pozsega, Somogy, Valk√≥, Varasd and Zala. In the summer of 1226, Coloman visited Dalmatia where he was ceremoniously received in the towns. He made donations to the Bishopric of Trogir and confirmed his mother's grant to the H√°jszentl≈ërinc Chapter. His following extant diplomas were issued in 1229. Estates located in Szepes were the subjects of both diplomas, implying that Coloman had mostly stayed in Szepes from 1226 to 1229, according to Font and Barab√°s. Coloman supported B√©la's attempts to revise their father's grants already during Andrew II's lifetime. The two brothers jointly confirmed a grant made by a previous ban of Croatia in 1231. Coloman ignored the privileges of the Knights Templar and wanted to collect taxes on their estates. The pope appointed Bartholomew le Gros, the bishop of P√©cs, to arbitrate in the dispute together with the abbot of P√©csv√°rad Abbey and the provost of P√©cs Chapter, but also forbade them to excommunicate Coloman without his special authorization. The three prelates persuaded Coloman to confirm the knights' privileges on 31 July 1231, but a full reconciliation was reached only after lengthy negotiations in 1239. Coloman granted liberties to the German, Saxon, Hungarian and Slavic \\"guest settlers\\" of Vukovar in 1239. He also confirmed the right of the \\"guest settlers\\" of Vara≈ædin to elect their judges and put their obligations in writing. Coloman initiated the merger of the Archbishopric of Split and the Bishopric of Zagreb, but Pope Gregory IX reminded him in 1240, that the two dioceses could not be united without the consent of the archbishop of Kalocsa and the chapters of their sees. In 1231, Coloman granted privileges to Vukovar (). Coloman, similarly to his brother, opposed his father's third marriage with Beatrice d'Este and following the death of King Andrew II (21 September 1235) they accused their young stepmother of adultery. Pope Gregory IX persuaded him to pursue the heretics in his provinces and in the adjacent territories; therefore he invaded and occupied Bosnia and Zachlumia but he could not wind up Bogomilism. He supported the establishment of the Diocese of Bosnia and he granted ƒêakovo () to its bishop. When he was informed that the Mongols invaded the kingdom, he joined to his brother's troops. However, their troops were defeated at the Battle of Mohi (11 April 1241). Coloman suffered serious wounds and died of his injuries a few weeks after the battle. Titles Coloman was styled \\"by the Grace of God, king of the Ruthenians, and by his glorious father's generosity, duke of Dalmatia and Croatia\\" in his first extant charter in 1226. G√∂nc√∂l, Archbishop of Split, referred to Coloman as \\"king and duke of Slavonia\\" in 1229. The first document mentioning Coloman's rule in \\"whole Slavonia\\" was issued by the Zagreb Chapter in 1230. He was consequently styled as \\"king, and duke of whole Slavonia\\" from the late 1230s.

The games are much like the games of the Hudson Soft- produced Mario Party series, where you compete in mini-games to win the game. Gameplay The gameplay in this game is different from other games of its kind. In starting the game, there are only up to 4 different choices. You then vote on these choices, the more votes a game receives the more it increases the chance of the spinner landing on it. Whatever game the spinner lands on is then played. Similar to the popular Mario Party series, you play on a game board, which features an item shop stocked with items for use on the board's spaces. In order to win the game, you must advance and land on the flag where it says destination. You then have to play another minigame to win the park. When you win the most parks you advance to a boss stage. Upon the boss' defeat, you win the game and the credits appear. Reception Disney's Party received bad reviews with gaming critics, for example receiving a score of 3 out of 10 from Game Informer magazine.

A rub of the lamp releases Adil, a trainee genie from Balamkadaar who has been confined to life in the lamp for a thousand years. Genie in the House ran for four series, from May 2006 to December 2010, with a total of 78 episodes. The series was aired in over 100 countries and in March 2012, Genie in the House aired on the Starz Kids & Family pay-TV network in the United States. Production The show is based on an original idea ‚Äî the collective work of Phil Ox, Steven Bawol, Isabelle Dubernet and Eric F√ºhrer ‚Äî and is a French/English co-production, produced in English by French company Moi j'aime la television. At one point, You Wish! was considered as a working title, and was used for the pilot show, but it was discovered that there had been an American sitcom, You Wish, with the same name, so Genie in the House was chosen instead. The show's theme song was written especially for the show, with music by Jean de Aguiar and lyrics by Kevin Eldon. It is sung by Lorraine Pearson. Series 1 was recorded at Elstree Film and Television Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire and was first aired on 29 May 2006. It is currently being repeated on Nickelodeon in the UK. Series 2 started recording at the BBC Elstree Centre in Borehamwood on 29 June 2007, for broadcast in October 2007. The show has been sold, sometimes in dubbed form, to Turkey (Turkish), France (French), Belgium (Walloon/Flemish), Italy (Italian), Spain (Castilian), Portugal (Portuguese), Russia (Russian), Ukraine (Ukrainian), India (Hindi), The Netherlands (Dutch) and Germany (German).

It was filmed on location in Paris nearby countryside. =Soundtrack= * There's a Genie in the House by Lorraine Pearson (theme song only) * Tropical Girl by Kevin McDermott and in double trouble with Ashley B * The Pineapple Song by Ayshea Episodes Characters =Adil the Genie= Adil (Jordan Metcalfe) was born in the fourth century in the suburbs of the city of Balamkadaar. He has the outward appearance of being 15 years old but has actually lived for 1500 years. His father was a genie (to be found today in a bottle of pop at the bottom of the Nile) and his mother was a teacher of the Dance of the Seven Veils. Like all children, Adil went to school, only his was a Genie School, the world-famous School for Genie Arts and Sciences. Adil was not a perfect student. One day he climbed into a lamp as a dare, strictly forbidden for first-year students, and got himself stuck. Unfortunately, the 40 thieves chose that very night to burgle the school and steal the lamp. Forgotten for 100 years or so in Ali Baba's cave, the lamp eventually passed from hand to hand, before ending up in the attic of the Norton family's new home. Adil is proud to be a genie and is always ready to serve his new master and mistresses. But he does have a problem. Unfortunately, he often skipped his classes and never finished the academic year. Because of this, he has not quite got the hang of magic, and rarely gets things right, and most wishes are granted more or less \\"approximately\\". Adil is always at the root of whatever is going on, and his costume (red pantaloons, red waistcoat and red turban) rarely changes. =Philip Norton= Philip (Adam Morris) is a talented and successful designer father. He constantly has to meet the deadlines set by his boss, Max, as well as bringing up two teenage girls. With an over-eager genie to the mix, Philip sometimes feels a bit put upon. Adil is categorically forbidden to grant Emma and Sophie wishes for three reasons: # It's a very bad habit to get what you want simply by clicking your fingers. # If anyone finds out there is a genie in the house, life could become very difficult. # Adil usually grants wishes incorrectly, whereafter there has to be dealt with troublesome consequences. If the girls break this rule, he has no hesitation in using the full range of traditional punishments. He'll ground his daughters, withhold their pocket money or forbid them from staying at their aunt's house in the country, or all of the above. Despite his dislike of magic, Philip seems to like Adil as a person. The genie's presence means that Philip is no longer the only man in the house, and gives him someone to watch sport with on the TV and play Tennis by also having fun at the same time. He has encouraged Adil to become a football fan, an F1 fan, a fan of the Olympic Games... in fact he has made him a fan of every single sport you can watch. But if Adil does break the rule and grant his daughters their wishes, he is severely punished, the most effective punishment is being locked up in the lamp for an entire weekend. Philip has forbidden his daughters to use Adil's services and extends that prohibit to himself. =Sophie Norton= Sophie (Katie Sheridan), the older of the sisters. Passionate about what makes the world tick, Sophie's favourite lessons are physics, chemistry, history and geography and she would love to go to university and to study as different languages and subjects as possible. She apparently doesn't like drama, however. Days off, weekends, and holidays are a handful of activities, sports, and educational visits of all kinds. She is not particularly interested in romance, often being oblivious to the attentions of boys until Emma points out her crush on her boyfriend Clive. Sophie thinks Adil is great but at times clueless. He never, ever stops asking questions and Sophie just loves to answer as many as she can. Although she doesn't like it, on several occasions she has defied her father by making wishes and has decided that if she's going to risk breaking her father's rules, she must take the utmost care. =Emma Norton= Emma (Vicky Longley), the younger of the two sisters by a year, Emma finds schoolwork intensely boring, unlike her sister. She manages to get by at school without too much difficulty, but without any brilliance either. She does appear to enjoy reading, but much prefers a good story to boring facts and figures in textbooks. Her days off, her weekends and holidays are organised around going to see a film with her friends, spending hours painting, shopping, designing, singing (although she is no good), watching TV, going to parties, dating, dancing or moving the furniture around in her room... She loves her friends and her favourite topic of conversation is boys. She at times gets on well with Adil especially since she loves to hear his wacky stories, whether they are true or not. Although she knows the risks of Adil's botching magic, they do not faze her; indeed, she seems to get some fun out of the ridiculous situations his magic gets them into. She loves designing clothes and dreams of becoming a top fashion designer. =Caroline Smart= Caroline (Victoria Gay) is Philip's helping hand around the house and with the girls. Although technically she lived next door, she managed to persuade Philip years ago to give her a key to the house so she could come and go as necessary. Caroline was never brought back for the next two series and her character is referred to as having recently moved to France and married. =Other Characters= * Abdab (Nicholas Khan) (Series 1-2) * Aisha (Leyla Pellegrini) * Alex Delaney (Shamus Iqbal) * Ali Baba (Peter Peralta) * Anabell Scott (Hannah Tointon) (Series 1) * Bonnie Swift (Georgia Slowe) * Clive (Darren John) (Series 2-4) * Dancer (Pixie Lott) (Series 1 Episode 14) * Djamola (Deborah Alobah) * Elmer Norton (Glyn Angell) (Series 3) * Frank McCartney (David McMullen) * Harold (Jack Blumenau) (Series 1) * Hunk (Glyn Angell) * Jamilla (Susan Kyd) * Lady Isabella (Elizabeth Conboy) * Len (Alexander Wilson) * Lindy Lou (Kristal Archer) * Mamoun (Matthew Leitch) * Max Baxter (Angus Kennedy) * Melissa Fox (Ellen Lister) (Series 2) * Miss Mayer (Katy Bartrop) * Mr Hull (Richard Freeman) * Mr Preston (Philip Fox) * Mr. Osterman (Johnnie Lyne-Pirkis) Note: He is Austrian-born. * The Mummy (Tom Underwood) * Nanette (Olivia Caffrey) * Nev (Harry Lloyd) * Reject #1 (Danielle Mitchell) * Reject #2 (Eleanor Wild) * Reject #3 (Kayleigh Batchelor) * Reject #4 (Lyneah Johnson) * Owen (Theo Fraiser Steele) (Series 2-4) * Peggy (Arabella Weir) (Series 2) * Prince Otto (Nathan Guy) * Prince Otto's Courtier (Eric Kolelas) * Royal Hunk (Joshua Bowman) * School Friend (Jermaine Lynch) * Shona (Jessica Ashworth) * Sophie's PA (Naomi Heffernan) * Atom, Boyband Member and Dancer (Tom Andrew Hargreaves) External links * Films shot at Elstree Studios British children's television series 2000s British sitcoms 2006 British television series debuts 2009 British television series endings Fantasy comedy television series Jetix original programming Genies in television Television series about families Starz original programming British fantasy television series ","title":"Genie in the House"},{"id":"5715860","text":"was a Japanese Heian period bureaucrat, who held the post of Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).

He was also an international merchant, first president of the Hamilton Club, founder of Hamilton and Toronto boards of trade - forerunners to modern chambers of commerce - and founder of the regiment that later became the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry. Career He was born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1810 to Peter and Margaret Buchanan. He became an apprentice to a firm of Glasgow merchants in 1825. He then became a junior partner in a new Montreal wholesale business opened by the firm; Buchanan moved to York (Toronto) to be closer to clients in Upper Canada. In 1834, with his brother Peter, he bought the business in York and set up an office in Glasgow. He served in the local militia during the Upper Canada Rebellion. In 1840, he set up a new company in Hamilton; a Montreal branch was also established. In 1841, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly for the city of Toronto; he resigned his seat in 1843. In 1844, the Toronto branch of his business was closed and the operation in Hamilton was expanded. He helped establish the Free Church of Scotland in Canada West. In 1844, he moved to Hamilton, where he helped set up the Board of Trade, becoming its first president. In 1848, upset by the repeal of the Corn Laws in Britain, he left the business and moved back to Scotland, where he campaigned against free trade in Britain. In 1851, he rejoined the business and returned to Hamilton. He was a director in the Great Western Railway and he attempted to promote its development over those of the competing Grand Trunk Railway. In 1857, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly for Hamilton. While in office, he attempted to promote his railway interests but also negotiated refinancing of the city of Hamilton's debts after it borrowed heavily to finance infrastructure improvements. Buchanan also served as lieutenant-colonel in the local militia. He supported protectionist trade policies and opposed representation by population. His political interests distracted him from his business interests and, although he resigned his seat in 1865, the business failed in 1867. He sold his estate in Hamilton. Buchanan received a government appointment in 1879 which sustained him through his later years. He died in Hamilton in 1883. Fennell Avenue, Hamilton, Ontario Family Isaac Buchanan married Agnes Jarvie, daughter of Robert Jarvie, on January 27, 1843. The couple had eleven children. The couple entertained at the family home, \\"Auchmar\\", Clairmont Park, Hamilton. In 1862, when Mr. Buchanan was appointed the first commanding officer of the 13th Militia Regiment, Mrs. Buchanan presented to it a stand of colours. Mr. Buchanan died at Hamilton, October, 1883, aged 73. Mrs. Buchanan died in Hamilton, May 7, 1896, aged 71. One of the couple's sons, James Isaac Buchanan, Esquire, worked as a banker in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Tribute The Buchanan neighbourhood on the Hamilton, Ontario mountain was named after him. It is bounded by Fennell Avenue West (north), Mohawk Road West (south), Garth Street (west), and West 5th Street (east). Landmarks in this neighbourhood include Mohawk College, Hillfield-Strathallan College and Buchanan Park, which was also named after him. His original estate, the Claremont Lodge and Auchmar Estate, a house and gate lodge in the Carpenter Gothic Cottage style of architecture were built for the Honourable Isaac Buchanan in 1855. Ontario Heritage Trust Claremont Lodge and Auchmar 1855 The buildings still stand at the corner of Fennell Avenue West and West 5th Street and are currently a Hamilton Heritage site.

The Sacred Heart Church serves an estimated 140,000 people. The Parish Priest is Rev. Fr. Xavier D'Souza.Church Personnel, Sacred Heart Church. Retrieved on 15 June 2012. History In January, 1938 or 1939, His Excellency Giovanni Tirinanzi, Apostolic Vicar of Arabia, then based in Aden, came to Bahrain to meet the Emir of Bahrain, Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa Al Khalifa, with plans to build a church in Bahrain. The foundation stone for the new church was laid on June 9, 1939. Father Luigi Magliacani, whom Tirinnanzi knew as an expert in the building of churches, was called to Bahrain and given the responsibility of building the church. In just six months, the church, the priests' residence, and the Sacred Heart School, were built. The first mass, a Christmas midnight mass, was held in the new church. It was formally consecrated on March 3, 1940. The parish was the first Catholic church in the Persian Gulf.About Us, Sacred Heart Church. Retrieved on 15 June 2012. The Comboni Missionary Sisters arrived in May 1953 and were given the role of maintaining the school. The school is now run by the Apostolic Carmelite Sisters. As economy in the Persian Gulf region grew due to the discovery of oil reserves, more Catholic migrant workers arrived in Bahrain. To cater to their needs, Saint Barth's Hall was built in 1958 to provide a place for social gatherings and to house the clergy. Through the next 30 years, the number of Catholics grew in the region, mainly expatriates and migrant workers from South and Southeast Asia. The parish underwent major expansion under the leadership of Fr. Felicio Diniz, with the construction of the main church building in 1990. Other major developments include the building of the parish community center and the Third Millennium building. Current status The church caters mainly to the large expatriate population in Bahrain. Many parishioners have nationalities from India, the Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Arabs (mostly from Lebanon but also from Palestine and Syria). Services are conducted primarily in English, although there are services conducted in French, Spanish, Arabic, Malayalam, Tamil, Konkani, Filipino, Telugu, and Sinhala.Mass Services in respective languages, Sacred Heart Church.

CPH-CC emerged in 1926, following a major split in the Communist Party of Holland. Split The divisions in CPH had emerged in 1925, when the Communist International asked the leadership trio of the party to step down. David Wijnkoop, Willem van Ravesteyn and Jan Ceton had led the party since its foundation in 1909. The trio was accused of not fully implementing decisions given to the party by the International. After their demotion, the group would rally an oppositional tendency within the party. The group was able to gather strong support within the Rotterdam branch of the party, which was van Ravestyen's home turf. As a result, the entire Rotterdam organisation of CPH was expelled from the party. On May 22‚Äì24 other followers of van Ravesteyn and Wijnkoop were expelled. Formation of CPH-CC In July the group around Wijnkoop started publishing a monthly magazine, De Communistische Gids. On October 17, 1926, the expellees founded the CPH-CC as a separate party. The chairman of CPH-CC was Jan Hoogcarspel and its secretary was J. Mulder. CPH-CC considered itself as the true inheritor of the legacy of CPH. State intelligence sources claimed that around 200-300 CPH cadres had crossed over to CPH-CC. 1927 elections In the 1927 municipal elections, CPH-CC fared well in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and the northern parts of the country. In both Amsterdam and Rotterdam the CPH-CC vote-share outnumbered that of the CPH. In Amsterdam the party got 14 446 votes and two seats in the municipal council. In Rotterdam and Opsterland the party won two seats in each council. In Schoterland, Beerta and Finsterwolde the party won three seats in each council. Relations with the Communist International Notably amongst its main leaders, differences existed in CPH-CC over which attitude the party should have towards the international communist movement. Wijnkoop strove for recognition by the Communist International to the CPH-CC. Van Ravesteyn on the other hand, opposed rapprochement with the International. However, the international was not interested in recognizing CPH-CC as the legitimate communist party in the Netherlands. The 1928 congress of the Communist International decided to urge the CPH-CC to dissolve itself and that its members ought to return to CPH. 1929 election CPH-CC decided to contest the 1929 parliamentary election. The party got 29 860 votes nationwide (0.88%), compared to 37 622 votes for CPH. Both parties won one seat each in the lower chamber. Wijnkoop was elected on behalf of CPH-CC. The party had won 3.8% of the votes in Rotterdam, 2.43% in Amsterdam, 1.48% in Groningen and 1.07% in Friesland. Dissolution of the party Following the 1929 election, a general party conference was held in March 1930. The conference decided to move towards a reunification with CPH. Discussion began with the Communist International and CPH, and in the beginning of July the party was disbanded. The majority of its members joined CPH.

They are frequently found in star-shaped colonies of individuals.  Description  Asterionella average cell size is 60‚Äì85 micrometers long and 2‚Äì4 micrometers wide. It forms colonies that often consist of eight cells, but can vary up to 20 cells. The cells in the colony are attached by the apex by extracellular matter. By the way the cells are attached to each other, the colonies often look like stars or spiralling chains.  Reproduction The silica skeleton of a diatom cell (called the frustule) consists of an epitheca and an hypotheca. The hypotheca is slightly smaller than the epitheca. During asexual reproduction both thecae form the epitheca of the new daughter cell and each daughter produces a new hypotheca. Therefore one daughter cell is always smaller than the original cell. In order to regain their original size, it is usually assumed diatoms have to reproduce sexually, although this has not yet been observed in A. formosa. However, there may also be other ways to rejuvenate.Genetic variation in Asterionella formosa: is it linked to frequent epidemic of host-specific parasitic fungus?, De Bruin et al. 2004, J.Phycology. 40p823-830.

Its design was based on the comic-strip character Lilli, created by Reinhard Beuthien for the German tabloid newspaper Bild. The doll was made of polystyrene, came in two sizes, and had an available wardrobe of 1950s fashion. The Lilli doll was copied for Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler who then exterminated Lilli so she could market a product they called the Barbie doll. Production of the Bild Lilli doll ceased after Mattel bought the copyright. History Lilli was a German cartoon character created by Reinhard Beuthien for the German tabloid Bild. In 1953 the newspaper decided to market a Lilli doll and contacted Max Weissbrodt of the toy company O&M; Hausser in Neustadt bei Coburg. Weissbrodt designed a prototype doll based on Beuthien's cartoons, which was sold from 1955 to 1964; that year Mattel acquired the rights to the doll and German production stopped. Approximately 130,000 were produced. Today Lilli is a collector's piece and commands prices up to several thousand euros, depending on condition, packaging, and clothes. In the Coburg Doll Museum you can still see over 1,000 historic dolls today, including the \\"grandmother\\" of the world-famous Barbie. =Cartoon= Ordered to draw a \\"filler\\" cartoon for the June 24, 1952, inaugural issue of Bild, Reinhard Beuthien drew an unruly baby; his editor disliked it, so he adapted the drawing into a sexy pony-tailed blonde sitting in a fortune-teller's tent. She was asking, \\"Can't you give me the name and address of this tall, handsome, rich man?\\" The cartoon was an immediate success and became a daily feature. Lilli was post-war, sassy and ambitious, \\"a golddigger, exhibitionist, and floozy\\". The cartoon always consisted of a picture of Lilli talking, while dressed or undressed in a manner that showed her figure, usually to girlfriends, boyfriends, or her boss. To a policeman who told her that two-piece swimsuits are banned in the street: \\"Oh, and in your opinion, what part should I take off?\\" The last Lilli cartoon appeared on January 5, 1961. =Doll= Bild Lilli was available in two sizes: 30 cm (12 in) and 19 cm (7.5 in). She held three patents absolutely new in doll-making: The head and neck were not one form connected with a seam at the shoulders, but rather the seam was mid-neck, behind the chin; the hair was not rooted, but a cut-out scalp that was attached by a hidden metal screw; the legs did not sprawl open when she was sitting. The doll was made of plastic and had molded eyelashes, pale skin and a painted face with side glancing eyes, high narrow eyebrows and red lips. Her fingernails were painted red, too. She wore her hair in a ponytail with one curl kissing the forehead. Her shoes and earrings were molded on. Her limbs were attached inside by coated rubber bands. The cartoon Lilli was blonde, but a few of the dolls had other hair colours. Each Lilli doll carried a miniature copy of Bild and was sold in a clear plastic tube, with the doll's feet fitted into the base of a stand labelled \\"Bild-Lilli\\" that formed the bottom of the tube; the packaging was designed by E. Martha Maar, the mother-in-law of the Hausser company owner. Originally the tall dolls cost DM 12, the small DM 7.50 at a time when average monthly take-home pay was DM 200 to DM 400. As this price suggests, the dolls were marketed to adults, mainly men, as a joke or gag gift at tobacconists, kiosks and newsagents that normally sold flowers, chocolates and other small giftware. A German brochure from the 1950s states that Lilli was \\"always discreet\\", and that her wardrobe made her \\"the star of every bar\\", and an advertisement from the 1960s encouraged young men to give their girlfriends a Lilli doll as a gift, rather than flowers. (This latter advert was then referenced by a Lilli newspaper cartoon, where Lilli says to her boyfriend: \\"I found it so apt that you gave me a Lilli doll as a present - now, I've a similarly suitable present for you\\" while presenting him with a puppet). A total of 130,000 were made. The doll eventually became popular with children, too. Dollhouses, room settings, furniture, and other toy accessories to scale with the small Lilli were produced by German toy factories to cash in on her popularity amongst children and parents. Lilli came as a dressed doll‚Äîadditional fashions were sold separately. Her fashions, mostly also designed by Maar, mirror the lifestyle of the 1950s: She had outfits for parties, the beach and tennis, as well as cotton dresses, pajamas and poplin suits. In her last years, her wardrobe consisted mainly of traditional \\"dirndl\\" dresses. Lilli's dresses always have patent fasteners marked \\"PRYM\\". Lilli and her fashions were sold as children's toys in several European countries, including Italy and Scandinavian countries; outside Germany she is usually remembered as a children's doll. In the United States, she was just called \\"Lilli\\". Some Lillis have been seen in original 1950s packaging for an English-speaking market labelled \\"Lili Marleen\\", after the song. Decades later, American author Ariel Levy referred to Bild-Lilli as a \\"sex doll\\" in Female Chauvinist Pigs and in interviews about the Lilli-inspired Barbie doll, Eve Ensler referred to Lilli (without elaboration) as a \\"sex toy\\".V-Day Founder Eve Ensler on \\"I Am an Emotional Creature: The Secret Life of Girls Around the World\\" ‚Äî Democracy Now (radio/TV program), February 26, 2010 =Film= A film about Lilli was released in Germany in 1958: ' (Lilli, a Girl From the Big City), a comedy- mystery directed by Hermann Leitner. A contest was held to choose the star; the winner was the Danish actress Ann Smyrner. =Imitations and Barbie= Several toy companies (mainly in Hong Kong) produced dolls resembling Bild Lilli, some from purchased original molds. Also in Spain, Mu√±ecas FEJ (Guillen y Vicedo) copied the molds and made a very similar doll, but with darker skin, white earrings and articulated waist. However, Spanish society was extremely conservative then and was not ready for such \\"sexy\\" dolls. Mothers were not buying them for their daughters and the manufacturer had to retire them from the market. Mattel's Barbie doll, which appeared in March 1959, was based on Bild Lilli dolls that co-founder Ruth Handler had acquired in Hamburg.Lord, pp. 29‚Äì30. Barbie was made of softer plastic, wore less makeup, had paler skin, and the doll had rooted hair and non-moulded shoes and earrings‚Äîapart from that she was a lookalike of Lilli. Louis Marx and Company acquired the rights to the Bild Lilli doll from Hausser and sold Miss Seventeen and smaller Miss Marlene dolls. Mattel had bought all patents and copyrights to the Bild Lilli doll so that using that name as a book title or product name would infringe copyright laws. Marx unsuccessfully attempted to sue Mattel for patent infringement. Related characters In 1962 Beuthien created another cartoon character called \\"Schwabinchen\\" for a Bavarian newspaper, but it was not as successful as Lilli and the dolls inspired by her were of poor quality. Later he started \\"Gigi\\", who had even less success and never became a doll. References  Further reading  *Knaak, Silke.

Taylor comes from a strong rallying family, she is the daughter of veteran rally driver Norm Fritter, married to former Australian Championship driver Mark Taylor and mother to emerging driver Molly Taylor. She began her motorsport career at the age of 18, when she co-drove for her father, Norm Fritter, in the 1979 Repco Round Australia Trial, sparking a passion that lives to this day. She won her first rally as co-driver for Peter Glennie in 1986, and in 1993 she teamed up with Neal Bates and Toyota, and began to rewrite the local rally records. The two won the Australian Rally Championship the first year (1993), then backed that up with wins in the following two years as well, becoming the first team to ever win 3 consecutive championships outright (Ross dunkerton drew for first in 1977, breaking his hat-trick). New Zealand's Possum Bourne shattered that record with 7 consecutive wins from 1996‚Äì2002. In 1995, as well as winning their 3rd ARC championship, Neal and Coral also finished 1st outright in the Targa Tasmania tarmac rally. In the next six years there were numerous rally wins, and five second and one 3rd place in the ARC Championship. Also in this period was 3 consecutive 1st-in-class in the Targa Tasmania (1999‚Äì2001) in a Lexus IS200. 1997 saw a change of equipment, when they switched from the Toyota Celica GT4 to the Toyota Corolla WRC (3rd that year) In 2001, after winning their fifth 2nd place, due to new rules and regulations concerning vehicles, they were forced to take a year off while a new car was built by the team (Their Toyota Corolla WRC car no longer met regulations). They returned in 2003 in a new Corolla Group N Prototype, and finished 6th in the 2004 and 2005 championships, before returning to the podium with another 2nd in 2006. 2007 saw them in another new car, this time a Corolla Super 2000, and they become the first pair to win stages and finish on the podium in a S2000 spec car, and they finished 2nd in the championship for the 7th time, bringing their total to 11 podium finishes in 15 years Taylor has acted as co-driver for Neal Bates for 18 years, covering much of his rally career, and in several appearances on the World Rally Championship during the 1990s in Toyota Celica GT-Fours and Toyota Corolla WRCs. She won the Australian Rally Championship with Neal Bates in 1993, 1994 and 1995, placed second in the 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2006 and 2007 championships, and Third in 1997.

Bassist Doug Yule, who had replaced founding member John Cale in 1968, proposed his younger brother Billy, then sixteen years old; he was accepted. Yule started practising with the band (Doug Yule, Lou Reed and Sterling Morrison) immediately and made his live debut on June 24 at Max's Kansas City in New York City, during the legendary two-month engagement the band had there. In addition to the residency at Max's, he played drums on two songs on the band's fourth album Loaded. He played with the band until the end of the engagement on August 28, after which they temporarily stopped activities to cope with the loss of lead singer Reed, who had abruptly quit on August 23. When they reconvened with Doug Yule moving to lead vocals and guitar and Walter Powers coming in on bass, Maureen Tucker also returned from maternity leave, ending Billy Yule's time with the band. Two sets from the engagement, one in July and the other on August 23, were taped and edited to form the Live at Max's Kansas City live album. Yule plays on all selections. A final recording session for Loaded, which they recorded at the same time as the Max's Kansas City engagement, also featured Billy Yule on drums. Two of the songs recorded with Yule, \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\" and \\"Oh! Sweet Nuthin'\\", made the album, while a third song, \\"Ocean\\", was included on the 1995 Peel Slowly and See box set. 1973 A band featuring Billy and Doug Yule played the New England bar circuit in 1973, and was misleadingly billed as the Velvet Underground by the tour manager, despite the members' objections. In late May 1973, the band and the manager parted ways and the Velvet Underground name was laid to rest. The penultimate concert from this tour, on May 27, 1973, in Boston, was taped and eventually released on Final V.U. 1971‚Äì1973 (2001).

She was the prima donna at London's Sadler's Wells Opera (English National Opera) through much of the 1950s and 1960s.  Early life and career  She was born in Murrumbeena, a suburb of Melbourne. As a child, she had hoped to become a ballerina. However, she grew too big for this profession. She focussed instead on singing, taking vocal studies in Melbourne. Her operatic career began in 1950. In 1954, she sang Antonia in Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann before Queen Elizabeth II who was on her first tour of Australia. In order to gain greater skill she moved to London to study under the tenor Joseph Hislop who had also coached Jussi Bj√∂rling and Birgit Nilsson. After returning to Australia she quickly started to make a name for herself, taking soprano roles in operas by Mozart and Puccini, amongst others. It was while on an Australian national tour of Tosca that she had an extramarital affair with the Australian baritone Robert Simmons (they were later to marry), with whom she later had a son, John Simmons, now a Melbourne architect, and a daughter Geraldine 'Geri' Roggiero n√©e Simmons now a Sydney wildlife artist. This caused a scandal in 1950s Australia so she and Simmons headed for the United Kingdom. Sadler's Wells Once in Britain, Fretwell's first professional engagement was for Dublin's Grand Opera company. Her performances there came to the attention of Sadler's Wells and in 1955 they engaged her services as principal soprano. It was at this point she became known as Elizabeth Fretwell. Sadler's was where Fretwell's finest performances were given, and she gained rave reviews. This was no small achievement given that at that time Maria Callas was dominant on the London opera stage. From the early 1960s to 1970 she went back and forth between Australia and the UK performing. In 1965 she gave her only performances at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in Aida and Il tabarro. She also performed with Scottish and Canadian companies and in North America. Later career and death In 1969 Fretwell sang opposite Tito Gobbi in Falstaff, finally joining the ensemble of The Australian Opera in 1970. During 1973 she sang in the opening season of the Sydney Opera House. She remained a member of the Australian Opera (now Opera Australia) until her retirement. In her later career she took on smaller roles, to give up-and-coming singers there a chance to further their careers as principal singers. Her retirement was very low key; no one in the company knew of her impending retirement before she left. She did not want any fanfare or accolades at her last performance, and therefore only the management of the Australian Opera knew of her decision to retire in the late 1980s. She simply gave her last performance, then quietly went to her dressing room, packed up her makeup and personal belongings, and went home to her beloved house at Bayview, on the northern beaches of Sydney, and reverted to her married name of Betty Simmons. She later served on the Opera Foundation's board for a number of years. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1977. On 5 June 2006 she died suddenly at her Bayview home, from a ruptured cerebral artery aneurysm, aged 85. She was survived by her son and daughter, and four grandchildren.

Together with Leslie Henson, he set up the Entertainments National Service Association, or ENSA, in 1939 to provide entertainment for British armed forces personnel during the Second World War. Biography Born in Croydon, south London, Dean started his career in showbusiness in London as a West End stage actor, and then later became a theatrical producer. He later moved into the film industry and in the early 1930s founded Associated Talking Pictures (later, under Michael Balcon, to become Ealing Studios). He publicised and worked alongside Gracie Fields and George Formby, among other entertainers. When World War II started, he left the film industry and became the head of ENSA, the government-sponsored body responsible for bringing live performances to the armed services. He was awarded the CBE for his work with ENSA, which he described in a book called The Theatre at War. His wives included Lady Mercy Greville and Esther Van Gruisen; also, from August 1934 until 1939, he was married to British stage and film actress, Victoria Hopper. Earlier, Dean had a relationship with one of his theatre and film stars Meggie Albanesi and after her early death in 1923 continued to be obsessed with her.

It was run by the Military Police of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia to detain Bosniaks, Serbs, and other non-Croats and was located at a former military facility of the JNA in Rodoƒç, south of the town of Mostar. The camp The camp consisted of a sports hall and a three-story central prison building. Conditions at the Heliodrom camp were inhumane, with severe overcrowding, inadequate medical and sanitary facilities, insufficient food and water, inadequate ventilation, and in the summer, suffocating heat. Detainees often slept on concrete floors with no bedding or blankets. On some occasions, HVO guards withheld all food and water from the detainees, in retaliation for HVO military setbacks. Herceg- Bosna/HVO forces regularly mistreated and abused, and allowed the mistreatment and abuse of, Bosniak detainees, both at the Heliodrom itself and at various locations where detainees were taken for forced labour or other purposes. There was regular cruel treatment and infliction of great suffering, with HVO soldiers and guards routinely beating detainees, often to the point of unconsciousness and severe injuries. Bosniak detainees lived in constant fear of physical and mental abuse. Bosniak detainees were often humiliated in various ways, including being forced to sing nationalistic Croatian songs. On 5 July 1993, HVO members fired indiscriminately at the building in which the detainees were being held. It is not known whether there were injuries. Bosniak men were held and continued to be detained at the Heliodrom camp without any bona fide or adequate effort by the Herceg-Bosna/HVO authorities or forces to distinguish, classify or separate military prisoners from civilian detainees, or to provide for the release of civilian detainees. In the Prliƒá et al. case, the Chamber found that several dozen detainees on forced labour were killed or wounded due to military confrontation while working on the front line. It also found that at least three Bosniak detainees were injured and four were killed while being used as human shields in combat. The Prosecution claimed in the indictment that at least fifty-four Bosniak detainees were killed and at least 178 were wounded on forced labour or as human shields. Recent developments Jadranko Prliƒá, Bruno Stojiƒá, Slobodan Praljak, Milivoj Petkoviƒá, Valentin Coriƒá, and Berislav Pu≈°iƒá were all charged with being part of a joint criminal enterprise from November 1991 to April 1994 to ethnically cleanse non-Croats from certain areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The indictment states that members of the enterprise (along with the HVO) set up and ran a network of prison camps, including the Heliodrom camp and Dretelj camp, to arrest, detain and imprison thousands of Bosniaks. Bosniaks in the camps were allegedly starved and subjected to \\"physical and psychological abuse, including beatings and sexual assaults\\". The six accused were charged on the basis of both their individual and superior criminal responsibility under Articles 7(1) and 7(3) of the Statute respectively for: * nine counts of grave breaches of the Geneva conventions (willful killing; inhuman treatment (sexual assault); unlawful deportation of a civilian; unlawful transfer of a civilian; unlawful confinement of a civilian; inhuman treatment (conditions of confinement); inhuman treatment; extensive destruction of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly; appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly). * nine counts of violations of the laws or customs of war (cruel treatment (conditions of confinement); cruel treatment; unlawful labour; wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or destruction not justified by military necessity; destruction or willful damage done to institutions dedicated to religion or education; plunder of public or private property; unlawful attack on civilians; unlawful infliction of terror on civilians; cruel treatment), and * eight counts of crimes against humanity (persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds; murder; rape; deportation; inhumane acts (forcible transfer); imprisonment; inhumane acts (conditions of confinement); inhumane acts).

It is the sulfur equivalent of the iron oxide magnetite (Fe3O4). It was first described in 1964 for an occurrence in San Bernardino County, California, and named after the mineralogist and physical chemist Joseph W. Greig (1895‚Äì1977). Natural occurrence and composition It occurs in lacustrine sediments with clays, silts and arkosic sand often in varved sulfide rich clays. It is also found in hydrothermal veins. Greigite is formed by magnetotactic bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Greigite has also been identified in the sclerites of scaly-foot gastropods. The mineral typically appears as microscopic (< 0.03 mm) isometric hexoctahedral crystals and as minute sooty masses. Association minerals include montmorillonite, chlorite, calcite, colemanite, veatchite, sphalerite, pyrite, marcasite, galena and dolomite. Common impurities include Cu, Ni, Zn, Mn, Cr, Sb and As. Ni impurities are of particular interest because the structural similarity between Ni-doped greigite and the clusters present in biological enzymes has led to suggestions that greigite minerals could have acted as catalysts for the origin of life. In particular, the cubic Fe4S4 unit of greigite is found in the Fe4S4 thiocubane units of proteins of relevance to the acetyl-CoA pathway. Crystal structure Greigite has the spinel structure. The crystallographic unit cell is cubic, with space group Fd3m. The S anions form a cubic close-packed lattice, and the Fe cations occupy both tetrahedral and octahedral sites.Vaughan, D. J.; Craig, J. R. ‚ÄúMineral Chemistry of Metal Sulfides\\" Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 1978. . Magnetic and electronic properties Like the related oxide magnetite (Fe3O4), greigite is ferrimagnetic, with the spin magnetic moments of the Fe cations in the tetrahedral sites oriented in the opposite direction as those in the octahedral sites, and a net magnetization. It is a mixed- valence compound, featuring both Fe(II) and Fe(III) centers in a 1:2 ratio. Both metal sites have high spin quantum numbers. The electronic structure of greigite is that of a half metal.

He was Junior Counsel at the Nuremberg Trials, and later a founding director of Amnesty International. He was also known for his romantic liaisons, marrying four times and having numerous other affairs. Marreco was the only son of Geoffrey Marreco of St Mawes in Cornwall. Marreco's family were of Portuguese descent, although his great-grandfather had become a naturalised British subject. He was educated at Westminster School, where he met Mahatma Gandhi and T. E. Lawrence. He then attended RADA but was expelled when he missed lessons to attend the Derby. In the Second World War, Marreco was commissioned in the RNVR in 1940, serving as a Lieutenant Commander in the Fleet Air Arm until 1946. He served on the staff of the Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, and on . Marreco was called to the Bar at Inner Temple in 1941. The Attorney-General, Sir Hartley Shawcross, was a friend of his father, and he invited Marreco to become Junior Counsel in the British Delegation at the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, also known as the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal, in 1945 and 1946. He continued to serve as an adviser in post-War Germany, until 1949, but never returned to the bar. Marreco stood as a Liberal Party candidate for Wells in the 1950 general election. He then stood at Goole in the 1951 general election. He was later a director of publishing company Weidenfeld and Nicolson and a banker with SG Warburg. He maintained homes at Porthall, a Georgian house near Lifford in County Donegal where he bred Charollais cattle, and in Shepherd Market in Mayfair in London. In later years, he retired to Aldbourne in Wiltshire. Marreco lent his support to Peter Benenson, the son of his neighbour in London, as when Benenson founded Amnesty International in 1960, but resigned as treasurer in 1971 when Amnesty refused to investigate reports of torture by British troops in Northern Ireland. He was married four times, but also had numerous affairs with other women. He married Lady Ursula Manners, eldest daughter of the John Manners, 9th Duke of Rutland and Kathleen Tennant, in 1943, but they divorced in 1948. While serving in Germany, he became the lover of Lali Horstmann, then aged 66, the widow of Alfred Horstmann. He then became involved with Louise de Vilmorin through the late 1940s until 1951. He reestablished his relationship with Lali Horstmann in 1951, joining her in South America and remaining with her until she died in August 1954, when he inherited part of her fortune. He later took up with Loelia, Duchess of Westminster. He married again in 1955, to Brazilian Regina de Souza Coelho, but marriage was dissolved in 1961. He married for a third time later that year to Anne Wignall (n√©e Acland-Troyte). She died in 1982, and he remarried his second wife in 2004.

For past club sponsorship names, see the list below. History Associazione Pallacanestro Udinese (APU) was founded in 1944. It wasn't a particularly notable organisation until businessman Rino Snaidero (head of the Snaidero Cucine kitchen furniture company) became the owner in 1965. With his backing the club, now known as Snaidero Udine, reached the first division Serie A in 1968. A new arena, named Palasport Primo Carnera after the boxer of that name, was built in 1970. Star players such as foreigners Joe Allen, Bob Fleischer and Jim McDaniels, as well as Italians Claudio Malagoli and Ivan Bisson helped the side finish fifth and fourth in the Serie A in 1972 and 1973, the latter a historic best. The Snaidero family withdrew from the club in the 1970s, it would spend the rest of its existence in the second tier Serie A2 with a few parentheses in Serie A until disappearing in 1992. Another Udine side, Libertas Udine, would play in the Serie A2 for two seasons between 1993 and 1995 before itself ceasing activities in 1996. Edi Snaidero, the son of former owner Rino, relaunched Snaidero Cucine Udine in 1999, buying the rights of Palladio Vicenza to play in the 1999-2000 second division. The side, coached by Matteo Boniciolli and containing players such as Charles Smith and Teoman Alibegovic returned to the Serie A after one season, winning their best-of-five final promotion series. In their first season back in the elite, Snaidero qualified to the playoff quarterfinals but lost a five-game series against Scavolini Pesaro. That position was enough to play in Europe for the first time in 25 years, reaching the round of 16 in the 2001‚Äì02 FIBA Saporta Cup. Having again lost in the playoff quarterfinals in 2001-02, Snaidero took part in the first-ever ULEB Cup in 2002-03, advancing to the eightfinals. Snaidero featured players like Demetrius Alexander, Michele Mian, Damir Mulaomeroviƒá or Sasha Vujaƒçiƒá, who joined the Los Angeles Lakers having started with Snaidero's junior team. After indifferent results the next four seasons, the team hired coach Cesare Pancotto before the start of the 2005-06 season. Snaidero went on to match its second-best ever ranking of fifth in the Serie A, thanks to a mix experience and youth with players such as Jerome Allen, Mian, Nikos Vetoulas, Kyle Hill, Silvio Gigena, Jacob Jaacks and Christian Di Giuliomaria. Though they were swept in the playoffs, they earned the right to participate in the ULEB Cup again, reaching the Eighthfinals.

Administratively, Woodchurch is within the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, its parliamentary constituency is Wirral West, and its local council ward is Upton. At the 2001 Census, it had a population of 8,400 (3,840 males, 4,560 females). Woodchurch is dominated by a large housing development, known as the Woodchurch Estate. The district is served by several schools and has the major Arrowe Park Hospital just outside its boundary, which was built on of the park itself and opened in 1982. History Holy Cross Church. Woodchurch was originally a farming area and ancient village of the Wirral Hundred, known mainly for its parish church and the neighbouring Arrowe Park country estate. The first recorded owner of the land was an Anglo-Saxon chief called Aescwulf who claimed ownership of Woodchurch, Arrowe and Landican. Although not recorded in the Domesday Book, Woodchurch was recorded as Wude Church in 1093. The population was 52 in 1801, 96 in 1851 and 140 in 1901. =20th century= The area was purchased by Birkenhead Corporation in 1926, becoming part of Birkenhead civil parish. Construction of a new housing estate complete with shops, schools, industry and leisure facilities began immediately after World War II. Of the old village, only the church and its adjoining school remain. From 1968, the Champion Spark Plug Company operated an automotive components factory on Arrowe Brook Road, employing at one time over 1,000 people. It was closed in 2006 with production transferred to Italy. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the CO-OP operated a clothing factory and industrial laundry on Woodchurch Road and its water-tower and chimney were local landmarks. This business had become a Leo's superstore by 1986, and is currently a branch of Asda. Geography Woodchurch is in the northern part of the Wirral Peninsula, from the Irish Sea at Leasowe Lighthouse, a similar distance east- north-east of the Dee Estuary at Thurstaston and approximately west of the River Mersey at Woodside. The village of Woodchurch is situated on a lower prominence between Bidston Hill and Thurstaston Hill, with the centre of the village at an elevation of approximately above sea level. The River Fender bounds Woodchurch to the east. The Fender joins the Birket, before discharging into West Float and then into the River Mersey. Community New Hey Road. The housing estate was planned in 1944 by Sir Charles Reilly, although this scheme was replaced by that of his student, H. J. Rowse. Building commenced in 1946, with the first house being officially opened on 6 May 1949. The housing estate itself is populated by mainly low income residents, with well above average levels of unemployment. During the late 1960s and 1970s, youths from Woodchurch were periodically involved in gang violence with youths from neighbouring estates. In the early 1980s, during a period of exceptionally high national unemployment, the area gained a reputation for drug and social problems (as did some neighbouring estates like those of Noctorum and Ford). In the late 1980s the estate was given a facelift, along with some of its neighbours. Today its social problems are largely a thing of the past, although unemployment levels are still above the UK national average. =Religion= St. Michael and All Angels Catholic Church, Woodchurch Holy Cross Church is the Church of England church, dating from the 12th century. The distinctive Roman Catholic St. Michael and All Angels church was designed by the F. X. Velarde Partnership. This church was commissioned in 1962 and opened in 1965, to serve the parish which had been founded in 1952. Woodchurch Methodist Chapel was built in 1963. =Education= Despite the low income catchment area, the local comprehensive, Woodchurch High School, has consistently attained a strong ranking in the Government's national league tables for secondary education. Noctorum Girls School (later known as St. Benedict's) was situated on the edge of the estate, on the Woodchurch side of the M53 motorway. The school later closing in the early 2000s and, after being demolished in 2009, the site is now being redeveloped for new housing. =Leisure= Public houses Woodchurch has two public houses, these being The Woodchurch and the Arrowe Park Hotel. The Pelican was closed and demolished in the early 2000s. The Stirrup closed in November 2018. Parks and commons Woodchurch is situated adjacent to Arrowe Park. The housing estate is separated from the M53 motorway by a large piece of common land. =Sport= The Woodchurch Sportsbarn, adjacent to the leisure centre, in 2006 Woodchurch Leisure Centre has an indoor heated swimming pool, an aerobics studio, an adjacent social hub and a caged floodlit sports area with football pitches. The leisure centre hosts the Wirral Judo Club, as well as karate and archery clubs. Transport =Road= The A551 runs along the western side of Woodchurch, and the A552 along the southern side. The A552 and the M53 motorway cross with a three-level stacked roundabout at Junction 3 of the motorway, which is at the south-eastern corner of the housing estate. The M53 runs on an approximate north-south axis along the eastern side of the housing estate. The A5027 Upton bypass runs along the northern side of Woodchurch. Buses Services are run primarily by Arriva, and are coordinated by Merseytravel. =Rail= Upton railway station is the nearest station to Woodchurch, where Transport for Wales diesel services operate between Bidston and Wrexham on the Borderlands Line. Woodchurch railway station is proposed for this line. =Cycling= National Cycle Route 56 passes along the eastern side of the housing estate, along Ackers Road, Home Farm Road, New Hey Road and Carr Bridge Road, then on a paved path towards Upton railway station. This route goes from Chester to Liverpool, via Leasowe and Seacombe, and includes part of the Wirral Way along its course.

It is part of the Moreton West & Saughall Massie Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral and the parliamentary constituency of Wallasey. A small village primarily made up of large fields owned by local farmers, it is bordered by Greasby, Meols, Moreton and Upton. At the 2001 census Saughall Massie had a population of 1,260. History The Saughall part of the name has been recorded as deriving from salh and halh, meaning a place where sallows or willow shrubs grew or \\"Willow tree nook of land\\". Over the years the name has been spelt as: Saligh (1249); Salghale (1309); Salgham (1385); Saughoughe (1546). The name de Massie, de Massey or de Mascy has been connected to the Wirral since the time of the Norman Conquest. Baron Hamon de Mascey, whose family came from the settlement of Mascey near Avranches, Normandy, established Birkenhead Priory in 1150. His relations, the Masseys of Sale, settled on the Wirral during the reign of King John were supposed to have given their name to the village. Formerly a township in the Bidston Parish of the Wirral Hundred, Saughall Massie became a civil parish in 1866. The population of Saughall Massie and the nearby hamlet of Carr Houses was 98 in 1801, 176 in 1851 and 186 in 1901. The parish was abolished in 1933 and divided between the County Borough of Wallasey and Grange, near West Kirby. On 1 April 1974, local government reorganisation in England and Wales resulted in most of Wirral, including Saughall Massie, transfer from the county of Cheshire to Merseyside. As with several other agricultural settlements on the Wirral Peninsula, a timber peg mill once existed nearby. Saughall Massie's windmill was built circa 1580 to grind grain. It was demolished by 1875. =USAAF plane crash= On January 9, 1944 Lieutenant Jay Frederick Simpson, an American pilot from Gillett, Wisconsin was killed whilst test flying a Republic P-47 Thunderbolt (serial no. 42-75584) over Moreton. The plane had taken off from the US Burtonwood Airbase in Lancashire earlier. It flew out to sea and on its return over Hoylake he reported that the plane was on fire. It circled over the RAF West Kirby and was seen to lose height and flip over, and crash in a field near the Arrowe Brook south of the village. Pieces were dug up in 1974 and now reside in the museum of the War Plane Wreck Investigation Group at Fort Perch Rock, New Brighton. A small memorial plaque was unveiled on 21 March 2005 on the bridge across the Arrowe Brook on Saughall Massie Road overlooking the crash site. Geography Saughall Massie is in the northern part of the Wirral Peninsula, approximately south-east of the Irish Sea at Meols, about east of the Dee Estuary at West Kirby and about west of the River Mersey at Seacombe. The hamlet is situated at an elevation of around above sea level. Greasby Brook converges with Arrowe Brook to the south-west of Saughall Massie. Governance Saughall Massie is part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in the metropolitan county of Merseyside. The settlement is part of the parliamentary constituency of Wallasey. The current Member of Parliament is Angela Eagle, a Labour representative, who has been the MP since 1992. The area is also part of a local government ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, this being Moreton West and Saughall Massie Ward. Saughall Massie is represented on Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council by three councillors. These are Bruce Berry, Chris Blakeley and Steve Williams, who are all Conservative councillors. The most recent local elections took place on 2 May 2019. Landmarks The village consists of a number of historic buildings dating from the seventeenth century. In order to help preserve its historic and agricultural characteristics, Saughall Massie was designated a conservation area in January 1974. Saughall Massie Bridge is a single span, single carriageway bridge over Arrowe Brook. It was built from sandstone for ¬£200 in 1829. This was the first bridge constructed by notable Victorian civil engineer Sir Thomas Brassey at the beginning of his career. The bridge was awarded Grade II listed status by English Heritage in 2006. Transport =Road= The B5192 Saughall Massie Road, which heads west to Grange, is the main thoroughfare through Saughall Massie. The B5192 also connects to the A5027 Upton Bypass bordering to the east, the latter joining Junction 2 of the M53 motorway just to the north-east of Saughall Massie. =Rail= Saughall Massie is equidistant to both Moreton and Meols railway stations on the Wirral Line of the Merseyrail network. Saughall Massie is also a similar distance from Upton railway station on the Borderlands Line, operated by Transport for Wales.

In 2006, she received the prestigious Charles Wollaston Award from the Royal Academy. Life and education Chantal Joffe was born in St. Albans, Vermont, USA. Her younger brother is contemporary artist and novelist Jasper Joffe. Their mother, Daryll Joffe, is also an artist, painting in watercolours. Joffe completed her Foundation studies at Camberwell College of Arts (1987‚Äì88). She attended Glasgow School of Art in 1988‚Äì91, graduating with honours and receiving her BA in Fine Art. She received her MA in painting from the Royal College of Art, which she attended from 1992‚Äì94. She was honoured with the Delfina Studio Trust Award in 1994‚Äì96 and the Abbey Scholarship (British School at Rome) in 1998‚Äì99. Joffe lives in London. Work Joffe primarily paints expressive portraits of women and children, often in very large scale, sometimes tall. In a 2009 interview with Stella McCartney, Joffe said, \\"I really love painting women. Their bodies, their clothes ‚Äì it all interests me.\\" Source images for her personality-filled oil paintings include family photos, advertising, fashion magazines, and pornography. Working roughly from her photographic source material, Joffe introduces distortions to her depictions. In the McCartney interview, Joffe mentions the photography of Diane Arbus as an inspiration for her art: \\"I find photography massively influential. Specifically, Diane Arbus, who I've been obsessed with my whole life. Her work has everything about the portrait of a human that you can ever want.\\" A critic for The Independent has said of her \\"big rude paintings\\" that \\"she paints with a kind of easy control ‚Äì effortless without being slick.\\" He further points out that her paintings may give an initial impression of simplicity, charm, or childishness, but \\"they have an unsettling quality which gives the exhibition an odd, rather menacing mood.\\" Some of her paintings are so large that she required scaffolding to work on them. Painting in huge, unfussy brushstrokes, she is unconcerned with stray drips and blobs of paint, and sometimes leaves old outlines visible. A reviewer noted that \\"painting the heads up close also makes for large, wonky eyes and odd proportions, like Picasso re-invented in manga.\\" In 2006, Colette Meacher, editor of the British magazine Latest Art, described Joffe's large paintings as \\"simply exquisite representations of femininity\\". Joffe often draws inspiration from fashion models, ‚Äúphotos of friends, the work of other artists‚Äù and images of women and children in realistic poses. Joffe‚Äôs work is reminiscent of Alice Neel, with whom she was teamed up for an art show and Joni Mitchell, the Canadian singer, songwriter and figurative artist. This group of artists are known for feminist messages in their work. Exhibitions and collections Chantal Joffe's work has shown internationally in many exhibitions. She has had solo exhibitions in London, Milan, Venice, Paris, New York, Helsinki and Bologna. Her work has also been featured in many group exhibitions. In 2002, she participated in an exhibition entitled The Bold and The Beautiful, at The Pavilions, Mile End Park in London. This show marked the first time Chantal, her mother Daryll Joffe, and her brother Jasper Joffe were featured in an exhibit together. She won the ¬£25,000 Charles Wollaston Award in the 2006 Royal Academy summer exhibition, for the \\"most distinguished work in the exhibition\\". The winning painting was Blond Girl ‚Äì Black Dress. The judges praised the painting as \\"an incredibly strong and striking painting ... There was no debate about the winner, the decision was reached unanimously.\\" Joffe has been featured in exhibitions at the Jewish Museum in New York City, including Using Walls, Floors, and Ceilings: Chantal Joffe in 2015 and Scenes from the Collection in 2019.

It is situated on the Wirral Peninsula, adjacent to the Woodchurch housing estate and to the south of the large village of Upton. The location has two landmarks: Arrowe Park Hospital and Arrowe Country Park, along with a number of residences. Historically within the county of Cheshire, the estate upon which Arrowe Park now lies was founded by John Shaw. His great nephew John Ralph Shaw built Arrowe Hall. Arrowe Park Hospital is a large acute accident and emergency facility that was opened in 1982. The country park was opened in 1926 with a golf club added in the 1930s. History Arrowe Hall Arrowe was a small village in the central part of the Wirral. The first recorded owner of the land was an Anglo Saxon chief called \\"Aescwulf\\". In 1240 it was owned by Roger de Montalt, 1st Baron Montalt. There is reference to a watermill in Arrowe in 1347. From the mid 15th century until the 17th century Arrowe was owned by the Dutton family of Dutton, Cheshire who were declared Lords of Arrowe. During the 18th century many farms sprung up around Arrowe. Arrowe Township was a block of land, east to west, between Arrowe Park Road and Limbo Lane and north to south, from Arrowe Brook Lane and the Arrowe Brook Road area, to Thingwall Road East and Thingwall Road. The township was in the parish of Woodchurch and included the hamlet of Arrowe Park. The population was 96 in 1801, 105 in 1851 and 121 in 1901 but had been abolished by 1933. In 1807, Liverpool mayor, shipowner and slave trader John Shaw first bought Arrowe House Farm and subsequently more and more of the surrounding land. On his death in 1829 it came into the ownership of his nephew, John Ralph Nicholson Shaw, who built Arrowe Hall in 1835 and had the grounds landscaped to form a country estate, with parkland, a lake and workers' cottages. Arrowe Hall may have been designed by John Cunningham, who certainly made additions. The Hall was extended on several occasions in the later 19th century. The property was handed down to Captain Otho Shaw, a world traveller and collector, who housed numerous items there. In 1908, Arrowe Hall and Park were acquired by Lord Leverhulme, who sold the estate to Birkenhead Corporation in 1926. Ownership was transferred again on 1 April 1974 from Birkenhead Corporation to the nascent Metropolitan Borough of Wirral local authority. In 1929, the 3rd World Scout Jamboree was held at Arrowe Park, with over 50,000 scouts and 320,000 visitors. There is a monument in the park which commemorates this event. Landmarks Arrowe Park Hospital Arrowe Country Park is a country park in the district that was opened in 1926. Arrowe Park Golf Club with an area of is within the park and was opened in the 1930s, it consists of a clubhouse and an eighteen hole course. Elsewhere in the park itself, there is a pitch and putt course, footgolf, tennis courts, bowling greens, football pitches and a children's play area. A public house was built in 1994. Arrowe Brook flows along the western edge of the park, from south to north, alongside a path. The brook also incorporates Arrowe Park Lake. Arrowe Hall, a Grade II listed mansion built in the Elizabethan style, is within the park. The hall was sold by the local council in 1997 and now houses a private care centre. Arrowe Park Hospital is a large, acute hospital, located on a section of Arrowe Park, close to the village of Upton. It was built on of parkland and officially opened by the Queen in 1982. It is one of three hospitals managed by Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, The maternity and gynaecology wing was later opened by, and dedicated to, the Duchess of Westminster.

The 6LoWPAN concept originated from the idea that \\"the Internet Protocol could and should be applied even to the smallest devices,\\"Mulligan, Geoff, \\"The 6LoWPAN architecture\\", EmNets '07: Proceedings of the 4th workshop on Embedded networked sensors, ACM, 2007 and that low-power devices with limited processing capabilities should be able to participate in the Internet of Things.Zach Shelby and Carsten Bormann, \\"6LoWPAN: The wireless embedded Internet - Part 1: Why 6LoWPAN?\\" EE Times, May 23, 2011 The 6LoWPAN group has defined encapsulation and header compression mechanisms that allow IPv6 packets to be sent and received over IEEE 802.15.4 based networks. IPv4 and IPv6 are the work horses for data delivery for local-area networks, metropolitan area networks, and wide-area networks such as the Internet. Likewise, IEEE 802.15.4 devices provide sensing communication-ability in the wireless domain. The inherent natures of the two networks though, are different. The base specification developed by the 6LoWPAN IETF group is (updated by with header compression, and by with neighbor discovery optimizations). The problem statement document is . IPv6 over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is defined in . Application areas The target for IP networking for low-power radio communication is applications that need wireless internet connectivity at lower data rates for devices with very limited form factor. An example is automation and entertainment applications in home, office and factory environments. The header compression mechanisms standardized in RFC6282 can be used to provide header compression of IPv6 packets over such networks. IPv6 is also in use on the smart grid enabling smart meters and other devices to build a micro mesh network before sending the data back to the billing system using the IPv6 backbone. Some of these networks run over IEEE 802.15.4 radios, and therefore use the header compression and fragmentation as specified by RFC6282. = Thread = Thread is an effort of over 50 companies to standardize on a protocol running over 6LoWPAN to enable home automation. The specification is available at no cost , subject to adherence to an EULA stipulating that Thread Group membership (in most cases paid) is required to implement the protocol.Thread 1.1 SpecificationThread Group It is to be launched in the . The protocol will most directly compete with Z-Wave and Zigbee IP. = Connected Home over IP = Connected Home over IP is the latest effort to standardize on a protocol running over 6LoWPAN to enable home automation, by combining it with DTLS , CoAP and MQTT-SN Functions As with all link-layer mappings of IP, RFC4944 provides a number of functions. Beyond the usual differences between L2 and L3 networks, mapping from the IPv6 network to the IEEE 802.15.4 network poses additional design challenges (see for an overview). =Adapting the packet sizes of the two networks= IPv6 requires the maximum transmission unit (MTU) to be at least 1280 octets. In contrast, IEEE 802.15.4's standard packet size is 127 octets. A maximum frame overhead of 25 octets spares 102 octets at the media access control layer. An optional but highly recommended security feature at the link layer poses an additional overhead. For example, 21 octets are consumed for AES-CCM-128 leaving only 81 octets for upper layers. =Address resolution= IPv6 nodes are assigned 128 bit IP addresses in a hierarchical manner, through an arbitrary length network prefix. IEEE 802.15.4 devices may use either of IEEE 64 bit extended addresses or, after an association event, 16 bit addresses that are unique within a PAN. There is also a PAN-ID for a group of physically collocated IEEE 802.15.4 devices. =Differing device designs= IEEE 802.15.4 devices are intentionally constrained in form factor to reduce costs (allowing for large-scale network of many devices), reduce power consumption (allowing battery powered devices) and allow flexibility of installation (e.g. small devices for body-worn networks). On the other hand, wired nodes in the IP domain are not constrained in this way; they can be larger and make use of mains power supplies. =Differing focus on parameter optimization= IPv6 nodes are geared towards attaining high speeds. Algorithms and protocols implemented at the higher layers such as TCP kernel of the TCP/IP are optimized to handle typical network problems such as congestion. In IEEE 802.15.4-compliant devices, energy conservation and code-size optimization remain at the top of the agenda. =Adaptation layer for interoperability and packet formats= An adaptation mechanism to allow interoperability between IPv6 domain and the IEEE 802.15.4 can best be viewed as a layer problem. Identifying the functionality of this layer and defining newer packet formats, if needed, is an enticing research area. proposes an adaptation layer to allow the transmission of IPv6 datagrams over IEEE 802.15.4 networks. =Addressing management mechanisms= The management of addresses for devices that communicate across the two dissimilar domains of IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4 is cumbersome, if not exhaustingly complex. =Routing considerations and protocols for mesh topologies in 6LoWPAN= Routing per se is a two phased problem that is being considered for low-power IP networking: * Mesh routing in the personal area network (PAN) space. * The routability of packets between the IPv6 domain and the PAN domain. Several routing protocols have been proposed by the 6LoWPAN community such as LOAD, DYMO-LOW, HI-LOW. However, only two routing protocols are currently legitimate for large-scale deployments: LOADng standardized by the ITU under the recommendation ITU-T G.9903 and RPL standardized by the IETF ROLL working group. =Device and service discovery= Since IP-enabled devices may require the formation of ad hoc networks, the current state of neighboring devices and the services hosted by such devices will need to be known. IPv6 neighbour discovery extensions is an internet draft proposed as a contribution in this area. =Security= IEEE 802.15.4 nodes can operate in either secure mode or non-secure mode. Two security modes are defined in the specification in order to achieve different security objectives: Access Control List (ACL) and Secure mode Pop culture references Big Trouble in Little China, a popular cult film in the hacking community, features a villain named Lo Pan.

History The Mechanics Institute in London,Ontario circa. 1860-1877 London Mechanics‚Äô Institute was one of a series of Mechanic's Institutes that were set up around the world after becoming popular in Britain. It housed a subscription library that allowed members who paid a fee to borrow books. The Mechanic's Institutes libraries eventually became public libraries when the establishment of free libraries occurred.Harris, Michael. History Of Libraries In The Western World. 4th ed. Metuchen, N.J.: Scarecrow Press, 1995, p. 153. The London Public Library opened in November 1896. The present-day Central Library was built in a remodeled space that formerly housed a Hudson's Bay outlet. The Central library opened in this location on August 25, 2002. This not only allowed for an economical expansion of the branch, but also offered the library a more central location in the city's downtown core. Additional outside donations enabled the construction of the Wolf Performance Hall, a concert hall which hosts music and theatre performances. The Central Library is also home to the Reading Garden which is equipped with seating and multiple water features. From 2016 to 2017, the Central Branch was extensively renovated, its first major overhaul since it moved into CitiPlaza. As part of this renovation, a portion of the branch's northern section was remodeled to become CBC Radio One's CBCL-FM's new broadcast studio for new local and regional programming such as London Morning and Afternoon Drive and as well as digital content.

In 1858, for instance, The Gazette described a library and reading room opened by a Mr W. F. Herre. This private library, located in the Hibben and Carswell Building on Yates Street near the corner of Wharf Street, was \\"fitted up in a very neat and comfortable style...\\". It was, the writer conceded, \\"yet limited, but so soon as the books can be obtained from San Francisco, [it] will be greatly enlarged.\\" The writer further explained that Mr Herre's library \\"filled a much needed want of the town\\". In 1861, the Victoria Literary Institute was founded. The Victoria Literary Institute's objective as described in its constitution was \\"the formation of a Library, Reading Room, and Museum; the delivery of Lectures, and the diffusion of Literacy and Scientific knowledge among the people of Victoria.\\" The Institute's shareholder's paid twenty-five dollars as well as a monthly fee of one dollar. Subscribers paid a five dollar entrance fee plus one dollar per month, or they could choose to pay for a lifetime membership at one hundred dollars. The Victoria Literary Institute however was only able to provide a series of evening lectures during the 1861-62 winter before being dissolved in the summer of 1862. Another early library--that of the British Columbia division of the T. Eaton Company--was started in 1862 by department store manager David Spencer.. = Mechanics' Institute = On December 16, 1864 the local Mechanics' Institute created Victoria's first community- oriented lending library. Located on Bastion Street, the library's collection included books donated by James Douglas (Governor). The Institute's rooms were \\"well lighted and warmed, and with their copious supply of reading matter, [formed] one of the pleasantest [sic] places in the city in which to pass a quiet hour.\\" In October, 1886, the Mechanics' Institute informed Victoria's city council that it intended to wind up its affairs and offered the book collection to the City. A referendum followed, and a majority of voters-- fearing increased taxes--rejected the proposal as an unnecessary \\"frill.\\" The books, however, were purchased by Mayor James Fell (with personal funds) and kept in storage. A subsequent vote, held little more than a year later, resulted in the City's acceptance of the books and the beginning of Greater Victoria's first truly public library. In 1889, the Mechanics' Institute collection of 4,150 volumes was presented to the City of Victoria as the nucleus of a new public library. An additional 389 works, valued at $500, were presented to the library by English publishers Cassells and Co.. The City, however, could not afford a purpose-built library; therefore, the collection was housed in rooms located in \\"Spencer's Arcade\\" (possibly provided by the YMCA) on Broad Street. = Victoria Public Library = Despite its difficult political and financial beginnings, the new Victoria Public Library that opened on May 10, 1889, fulfilled a clear and present need. According to a Colonist newspaper article, \\"Since the closing of the Mechanics' Institute, Victorians in the commoner walks of life have sorely missed the opportunities afforded of obtaining good and instructive reading [material].\\" The first book lent was The Life of Hon. George Brown. (Probably Alexander Mackenzie's The Life and Speeches of the Hon. George Brown published in Toronto in 1882.) It was borrowed by Victoria's Mayor John Grant. The Victoria Public Library was located in the YMCA building on Broad Street for only two years. In 1892, possibly as a cost-saving measure, the City council ordered the Library moved to rooms in the City Hall. In 1902 a bylaw was passed to limit library funding to $5,000 per year. In 1903, council deliberated over a permanent site for a library building. Two locations were chosen, with a price difference of $700. Council was against the higher priced property on the northwest corner of Yates and Blanshard Streets. But Stephen Jones, advocate of this site, broke the impasse by offering to pay the additional costs. In 1903, a by-law created a board of three commissioners (one being a member of council) to administer the library. The first commissioners--Rev. Canon Beanlands, E. O. S. Scholefield (of the Provincial Library), and Alderman Thornton Fell (Chairman)--first met on May 15, 1905. Meanwhile, construction of the new Carnegie library had begun in 1904. The neo-Classical stone building, constructed for $53,000, was financed by Andrew Carnegie. It was completed in 1905, but the library's collection remained in its makeshift quarters at City Hall until January 2, 1906, when it moved to the new building. = Early disputes = The Library's early years in the new building were characterized by disputes between the Library Commissioners and the city council. The Library's books and other materials provoked controversy, and candidates for public office made \\"political capital\\" of the fact that works such as The Decameron were available to borrow. Although the Library Commissioners refused to remove the criticized works, they were moved to a shelf in the librarian's office. On the other hand, the Commissioners refused to allow religious newspapers (such as The Christian Science Monitor) on the shelves. (This policy was reversed around 1914.) Weeks after taking over the new quarters, the matter of Sunday openings was before the Library Commissioners. In 1918, the Board maintained the policy of Sunday openings, despite the presence of city detectives, who (according to Pagett, 1934) would \\"visit the library, parade around on Sunday and subject the librarian in charge to heavy quizzing as to infringement of Sunday observance statutes.\\" = Early automation = When this library building opened in 1906, books were kept in \\"closed stacks\\" that did not allow public access. Instead, a user would request an item, and the librarian or page (clerk) would retrieve it. However, to let patrons know whether a book was in or out, the new library was equipped with a recently developed \\"indicator system\\". But this English system, which involved red and blue signals (see Pagett, 1934), required a staff of several librarians to keep it up-to-date. Therefore, in 1911, Victoria Public Library borrowers were allowed access to the stacks for the first time. = Victoria Library School = Under the leadership of chief librarian Helen Stewart, a library school was inaugurated as part of the Victoria Library. One student, Margaret J Clay, succeeded Stewart in 1924. Other graduates who went on to prominent positions included Margaret Crompton (later Mrs Thurston Taylor), who became reference librarian at the Enoch Pratt Free Library ; Phyllis Knowles (later Mrs Byron Blood), who was cataloguing librarian at the Webb Institute of Naval Architecture; and Elsie Taylor, who became assistant cataloguer at the American Library in Paris. = Early gaming at the library = When the library opened in the Carnegie building, only the first floor was used. But by 1910, that floor had become too small to serve the needs of Victoria's growing community. The reading room was therefore moved to the second floor. At about this time a \\"Chess and Draughts Room\\" (for chess and checkers) was also opened on the second floor. Noise from the \\"gamesters,\\" however, disrupted reading room users and the games were moved to an upstairs room in 1913, where they remained there for another ten years. Rooms in this upper floor were also used (prior to 1912) by the Natural History Society and the Victoria Musical Society. = Children's department = Although the idea of a children's department had been considered in 1910, that year's costs to re-arrange existing departments (and create the games room) left no funds to begin children's services. But the Library's commissioners explained the benefits of a \\"children's room\\" to City Council, hopeful the next year would bring the necessary funds: > In the first place the room is designed that the child may be introduced, > under careful supervision, to that wonderful fairyland which is the > bookworld, so that the little seeker after pleasure or knowledge may be > started on the right path. If a child's reading is left to haphazard choice, > it is not unlikely that his or her taste may become more or less perverted, > simply because there has been no one to advise or to guide; in any event it > is more than probably that in such cases a taste for the cheap and ephemeral > will be acquired at the expense of an appreciation of what is best and > purest in literature. It is the aim of the children's librarian to bring > together the children and the right books under the most favorable > conditions. The first children's department opened in 1913. The first children's librarian was Mrs Lillian B Steinberger. She was succeeded in 1914 by Mary Hughes, a graduate of the Carnegie Library Training School of Pittsburgh. = Service beyond the city of Victoria--and more struggles = The Library's core funding came from the City of Victoria, but residents of Oak Bay, Esquimalt and Saanich were able to use the library without restrictions. In 1912, however, the Library Commissioners asked each of these municipalities for an annual fee of $100, which would be applied to new book purchases. Fifteen months later, and no money having been received, the Commissioners requested $250. By January, 1914, when Commissioners requested $500 from each municipality, Oak Bay contributed this amount. However, instead of applying the amount to new book purchases (as contracted with Oak Bay), the City of Victoria intended to use it to reduce the City's tax levy. Since this was not the purpose for which the Commissioners contracted with Oak Bay, the cheque was returned. Attempts by Library commissioners to obtain contributions from surrounding municipalities continued until at least 1919. And well into the 1950s (and possibly not until the operating agreement of 1966) representatives of the other municipalities served by the Victoria Public Library had no representation (or else voice, but no vote) on the board of the Victoria Public Library. In 1924, Margaret Clay became chief librarian. Her term of office, which lasted until 1952, was a time of much change for the library. One former GVPL librarian characterized this period as \\"a series of struggles that forged the old 'free library' into a 20th century public library\\" (Teece; 1989).  Growth and troubles: 1949-1960  = New building addition = November, 1949: Plans approved for a four-storey addition to the original Carnegie Library. The successful bidder was Luney Bros. & Hamilton ($224,500). This would replace the original building--designed to hold 15,000 volumes. By 1947, it held 76,000. December, 1949: Referendum to approve $350,000 for new construction, furnishings, and renovations to the existing Carnegie Library building. Library operated in temporary quarters at the Pantorium building, corner of Fort and Quadra Streets. Monday, October 15, 1951: New addition officially opened. Departments gradually moved back. = Bookmobile service = October, 1952: Library Board decision to acquire a Bookmobile.. April 5, 1954: Bookmobile service begins, although the decision to provide bookmobile service had been made in 1952. A newspaper editorial of the time expressed some dismay that such a service was even necessary: > By taking the books to the people, rather than requiring the people to come > to the books, the board feels it will help to encourage good reading. > Perhaps it is unfortunate that such a service should be considered > necessary. It is nevertheless a symbol of the age and one which must be > faced if the library is to extend its usefulness beyond the ranks of those > who make use of the centrally located downtown building. The bookmobile route included Mount Newton Crossroad, Saanichton Agricultural grounds, Elk Lake and the eastern part of Central Saanich, Brentwood, and Wilkinson Road. However, the launch of the new service was overshadowed by the circumstances surrounding the dismissal of John Marshall, first director of bookmobile services.  The Marshall case: 1954  On January 25, 1954, John M. Marshall, the recently hired director of bookmobile services, received notice of his termination, effective the following week. Outgoing Library Board Chairman J. F. K. English said no reason was required because Marshall's probationary period had not yet expired. Newspaper reports cited unnamed sources who alleged various reasons for Marshall's termination--all involving either membership in or association with \\"Red-tinged organizations\\". According to one article, \\"A source in a position to have full details of the case informed the Times ... Mr. Marshall's dismissal resulted because his record showed at one time he was associated with the Westerner, a leftist newspaper published in Winnipeg, and that he attended Canadian Peace Congress meetings in Toronto in 1949, 1950 and 1951\\" (Book-Burning). Brentwood Bay At the same time as the Marshall case was unfolding, allegations surfaced of book censorship at the Victoria Public Library. Elgin Neish, an official of the Fisherman's Union, alleged that Victoria City Alderman Brent Murdoch was behind a \\"book-burning proposal\\" at Victoria Public Library. According to one newspaper report, \\"A suggestion [had] been made that pro-Communist books be 'cleaned up' in the library\\" (Book Burning). At the first meeting of the new Library Board, on February 3, 1954, Chief Librarian Thressa Pollock resigned. As she reportedly explained, \\"a certain circumstance\\"--unconnected with either the Marshall case or the book censorship issue--\\"confirmed my recent suspicion that it would be utterly impossible for me to continue to carry on my work as chief librarian of the Victoria Public Library should certain members of the 1954 Library Board continue to hold office on the board.\\" Board members for 1954 were James E. Neely (chair), Doris Lougheed, Ald. Brent Murdoch, Prof. Robert Wallace, and Lieut.-Col. Walter Mosedale (later disqualified because he did not live within Victoria's city limits). Other resignations followed. These included Nora Dryburgh (appointed bookmobile director in a temporary capacity after Marshall's dismissal) and Mrs. Ross Napier (head of the cataloguing department for 19 years). Library Board member Professor Robert Wallace publicly protested Marshall's dismissal and called on the board to allow Marshall not only to speak in his own defence, but also to reverse its decision to dismiss him. Support for Wallace's position came from the Victoria College Faculty and Staff Association, the Greater Victoria Teachers' Association, and the Saanich Teachers' Association.\\" While the controversy simmered, the Library Board appointed John C. Lort acting chief librarian, effective May 1, 1954.  1960s to present  Between July and October, 1962 a survey of the services offered by Victoria Public Library carried out by Rose Vainstein, assistant professor of the School of Librarianship at UBC. This survey was in response to complaints from PTAs and citizen groups and a desire for improved library service on the part of Saanich, Oak Bay, and Esquimalt. In 1966 the Greater Victoria Public Library was incorporated to serve the four core municipalities of Victoria, Saanich, Oak Bay and Esquimalt. At this time, control of the library passed from the City of Victoria to a board made up of representatives from these four \\"core\\" cities/municipalities. 1966: Town & Country Branch opens in rented space in the Town & Country Plaza, Saanich. 1969: Esquimalt Branch opens in rented space in Esquimalt Plaza. 1971: Oak Bay Branch opens. 1972: Saanich-Victoria Branch opens, replacing Town & Country Branch. 1976: Nellie McClung Branch opens in Saanich. It is named after Canadian feminist, politician, author and social activist Nellie McClung. 1980: Central Branch moves to its present location at Broughton and Blanshard from the Carnegie Library building. 1985: April 16, Esquimalt Branch opens its own new building. 1985: Automated library service begins. 1989: December 3, a fire destroys the Nellie McClung branch and all its books. A temporary library opened a block away on Garnet Road with a smaller collection of books that were checked out at the time of the fire. The building was rebuilt, reopening in August 1991. 1996: Service extended to Colwood, Langford, Highlands District and Metchosin. 1997: December, the Juan de Fuca Branch in Colwood opens. 1999: Saanich-Victoria Branch renamed after the famous author and artist Emily Carr. 2002: Service extended to Central Saanich and View Royal. 2003: May 15, Esquimalt Branch moves into a new building at the back of the Esquimalt Municipal Hall. 2007: October 11, Saanich Centennial Branch opens in the Pearkes Arena Complex, Saanich. 2008: February 17, CUPE 410 library workers are locked out indefinitely by the Greater Victoria Library Board following extended rotating job action and the breakdown of negotiations.

As a Nordic skier, Bergsland once beat the legendary Johan Gr√∏ttumsbr√•ten in competition. He also was national champion in rowing, golf, and dogsled racing. Later, Bergsland introduced alpine skiing to Norway, and was involved on the Holmenkollen organizing committee for 35 years, including 14 as president. From 1945 to 1951, he was Secretary-General of the International Ski Federation (FIS), later serving on the Council until 1969. Bergsland was also President of the Commission from 1951 to 1953 and served as an honorary member of the (FIS) until his 1982 death. He also wrote many skiing books, including one about the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo (1951). For his lengthy and diverse service in skiing, Bergsland received the Holmenkollen medal in 1973 (shared with Ingolf Mork and Franz Keller).

Anthony Tommasini, the chief music critic for The New York Times, has praised Page‚Äôs criticism for its \\"extensive knowledge of cultural history, especially literature; the instincts and news sense of a sharp beat reporter; the skills of a good storyteller; infectious inquisitiveness; immunity to dogma; and an always-running pomposity detector.\\" Other notable writings by Page include his biography of the novelist Dawn Powell, which is credited for helping to spark the revival of Powell‚Äôs work, and a memoir that chronicles growing up with undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder. Biography = Early life and education = Ellis \\"Tim\\" Batten Page Jr. was born in San Diego, California to Elizabeth Latimer Thaxton Page, a homemaker and former journalist, and Ellis Batten Page, a professor of educational psychology. Through his parents‚Äô record collection, Page developed an early fascination for music, particularly for the opera singers Enrico Caruso and Geraldine Farrar, and for \\"music that was nearly changeless, unfolding slowly and inevitably, with few surprises.\\" During their time in San Diego, the family was acquainted with Alan M. Kriegsman, then the music critic for the San Diego Union, and his wife Sali Ann Kriegsman, who lived in Page‚Äôs grandmother‚Äôs house. Page credits \\"Mike\\" Kriegsman for having an early influence on his desire to write about music: \\"Almost every night Mike attended a concert, wrote it up, and we could read all about it in the morning paper. I could imagine no better way to live.\\" In 1962, Page‚Äôs father accepted a full professorship at the University of Connecticut, where he would later help develop a system of grading essays by the computer known as Project Essay Grade (PEG) software. The Page family moved to Storrs, Connecticut; Page lived there until 1975, save a year-long stint from 1969-1970 when the family relocated to Caracas, Venezuela during Ellis Page‚Äôs sabbatical. From an early age, Page demonstrated an increasingly encyclopedic knowledge of music and an aptitude to catalogue significant historical names and dates. Page‚Äôs father used him as his \\"laboratory of choice\\" in experiments with standardized testing, and eventually began taking Page to his classes to \\"perform as a burgeoning genius.\\" Page struggled in school even as his musical abilities matured and his interests in literature and film, especially silent film, deepened. He recruited his siblings and classmates in his early efforts in filmmaking; in 1967, Page and his films were the subject of a short documentary by David and Iris Hoffman. A Day With Timmy Page screened in the 1968 New York Film Festival and as the opening selection of the first Festival of Young Filmmakers in New York. More recently, in 2019 the Echo Park Film Center in Los Angeles, California screened A Day With Timmy Page along with two of Page‚Äôs early films. \\"Prodigies have a tough time of things,\\" Page wrote in his memoir. His own experiences as a child genius, and the extreme praise and ostracism that came with it, influenced his later skepticism for solo careers for child artists and what he has described as \\"the cult of the prodigy\\": \\"It is deeply exploitative and often ruinous to young artists, and it transforms age ‚Ä¶ into a liability for more seasoned players.\\" Despite that, Page was also an early champion of Midori Got≈ç; he first praised her playing when she was 14 years old and later profiled her when she was 21. Page struggled with depression and anxiety throughout his later teen years: \\"My depression arrived like a Midwestern summer thunderstorm ‚Äî clouds moving in slowly, balletically, in strange air and mustard light. Everything I read, watched and listened to was unrelievedly gloomy, and this was having its effect.\\" On May 20, 1972, Page was a passenger in a fatal accident that killed two close friends. He does not drive to this day and attributes his reluctance to do so in part to this accident. Shortly after, Page attended an introductory class in Transcendental Meditation, beginning a lifelong habit of meditation, and in 1975 returned to the Tanglewood Institute, where he had spent previous summers. There, Page met the musician, teacher, writer and arts administrator Leonard Altman, whom Page credits as his \\"most significant mentor.\\" Under Altman‚Äôs guidance, Page moved to New York City in 1975 to enroll at the Mannes School of Music. Page attended Mannes for two years, where he studied music composition with Charles Jones. He quickly \\"decided that [he] was more interested in writing prose than in writing music\\" and transferred to Columbia University. Page dates his first mature piece of criticism to April 1976, when he was moved to write an essay about the world premiere of Steve Reich‚Äôs \\"Music for 18 Musicians.\\" = Career = Several weeks after graduating from Columbia, Page sent an unsolicited article about the 1979 release of the complete works of Anton Webern conducted by Pierre Boulez to the SoHo Weekly News. The paper accepted, published, and paid for the article. \\"And suddenly,\\" Page writes in his memoir, \\"I was a music critic.\\" Over the next several years, Page continued writing for the SoHo Weekly News and other publications while hosting a contemporary music program on the Columbia radio station WKCR. In 1981, he began an 11-year association with WNYC-FM, where he presented an afternoon program that broadcast interviews with composers and musicians, including guests like Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Dizzy Gillespie and Meredith Monk. Page has become one of the leading writers on the work of the idiosyncratic Canadian pianist Glenn Gould. Page spoke over the phone with Gould for the first time in October of 1980; what was supposed to be a brief interview lasted for nearly four hours. Over the next two years, Page and Gould spoke on the phone several times a week. They met only once during a three-day visit Page paid to Gould in Toronto, where the two conducted a one-hour radio drama comparing Gould‚Äôs two versions of J.S. Bach‚Äôs Goldberg Variations. This interview was released on the three-CD set A State of Wonder: The Complete Goldberg Variations 1955 & 1981 in 2002. Page edited the first collection of Gould‚Äôs writings, The Glenn Gould Reader, in 1984, which has never gone out of print. Page was a music writer and culture reporter at The New York Times from 1982 to 1987; in 1987, he became the chief music critic of Newsday. He was appointed the chief classical music critic of The Washington Post in 1995, and in 1997 he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism for what the Pulitzer board called his \\"lucid and illuminating music criticism;\\" the preceding year he had written on subjects that included the decline of classical music recordings and the position of the violin section in the orchestra. Page has also written widely on film and literature for the Post and elsewhere. In 1991, Page became fascinated by the work of the then-obscure novelist Dawn Powell. He wrote Dawn Powell: A Biography, published in 1998; he also edited and annotated the Library of America‚Äôs two-volume collection of Powell‚Äôs work, which was published in 2001. He has helped launch revivals of the writings of Sigrid Undset and Robert Green Ingersoll, and he wrote an appreciation of the late singer-songwriter Judee Sill, whom Page considers to be \\"an artist of extraordinary gifts.\\" Other writings have praised the musical contributions of Frederica von Stade, The Magnetic Fields and The High Llamas. Page has resisted differentiating between the musical merits of classical music and other genres, writing that \\"it had been my hope to infuse some of the passion, allusiveness and occasional irreverence I found in the best writing about jazz and rock back into the realm of classical music. Everything has always reminded me of everything else, anyway.\\" In 1993, Page served as the first executive producer for the short-lived record label BMG Catalyst. His projects included Spiked, an album of music by Spike Jones with liner notes by Thomas Pynchon; Memento Bittersweet, an album of music by Chris DeBlasio, Kevin Oldham, Lee Gannon and other HIV-positive composers; Night of the Mayas, the first American album devoted entirely to orchestral works by the Mexican composer Silvestre Revueltas; two solo recital discs by violinist Maria Bachmann and several others. Page has also produced concerts at venues ranging from Carnegie Hall to New York‚Äôs Mudd Club. From 1999 to 2000, he served as the artistic advisor and creative chair for the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. In 2007, the University of Southern California named Page a professor of journalism and music. He taught at USC until 2019; while there, he helped launch the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism‚Äôs master‚Äôs degree program in specialized journalism. Page has been a member of the Rubin Institute for Music Criticism since its founding in 2012, and in 2015, he was appointed \\"Visiting Scholar in Residence\\" at Oberlin College. In 2020, Tim Page retired from USC and moved back to New York City. =Autism spectrum disorder= Page revealed in a 2007 essay for The New Yorker that seven years earlier he had been diagnosed with Asperger‚Äôs syndrome, \\"in the course of a protracted effort to identify ‚Äî and, if possible, alleviate ‚Äî my lifelong unease.\\" The essay led to the publication of his book-length memoir Parallel Play, published by Doubleday in September 2009. In a review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote that the book is \\"not about Asperger‚Äôs, but it is intensified by the peculiar nature of Mr. Page‚Äôs Asperger-governed perceptions. Tirelessly logical, sometimes agonizingly so, he lives life in an extra dimension, with a sense of time that irrevocably links past and present, living and dead, ardent love affairs and broken ones.\\" Page has written that he \\"wouldn‚Äôt wish the condition on anybody ‚Äî I‚Äôve spent too much of my life isolated, unhappy, and conflicted ‚Äî yet I am also convinced that many of the things I‚Äôve done were accomplished not despite my Asperger‚Äôs syndrome but because of it.\\" = Traumatic brain injury and recovery = In 2015, Page collapsed at a train station in New London, Connecticut, having suffered from an acute subdural hematoma, or a clot of blood that puts pressure on the brain. Disabled at first, he took medical leave from USC for the better part of a year. Gradually he recovered, a process that he attributes to listening deeply to music that had comforted him throughout his life. He has written that despite his injury he has \\"enjoyed some of the best years of my life ‚Äì pacing myself carefully, seeing people when I can, teaching once more and even writing a bit.\\" Selected bibliography * The Hip Pocket Guide to New York (Harper and Row, 1982).

Biography =Early life= Bux was born at Pir Jo Goth near Bhansyedabad on 9 July 1890 in a spiritual family of Dadu District, Sindh, Pakistan. He was only 9 years of age when his father Pir Nawaz Ali Shah died. He was brought up by his maternal uncle Pir Lal Muhammad. His family is the descendant of Makhdoom Moosa, 5th son of Makhdoom Sarwar Nooh. =Education= Pir Sahib got his primary education from the Government Primary School Bhansyedabad and did his matriculation from Naz High School, Khairpur (Mirs). Thereafter, he went to Aligarh Muslim University for his higher education. He was the first member of his family who received higher education. Deeply moved by the Khilafat Movement, led by Maulana Mohammad Ali Jouhar, he soon left Aligarh Muslim University and joined Jamia Millia Islamia headed by Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar and did his B.A. from there. He was so deeply motivated by the Khilafat Movement and the struggle for the freedom of the Muslim Ummah that he left his studies and returned to Sindh as a leader of Khilafat Movement. On the suppression of the Khilafat Movement by the British Government, Pir Sahib was advised by Late Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, the then President, District Local Board, Larkana to go back to Aligarh for completing his studies. He also awarded him scholarship of the District Board for pursuing his educational career. Pir Sahib acceded to the advice of Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto and proceeded to Aligarh Muslim University from where he did his M.A. in History and thereafter obtained his degree in Bachelor of Law. Pir Sahib soon returned to Larkana and started his legal practice there as Dadu was part of Larkana district in those times. =Politics= Pir Ilahi Bux with Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah in 1940's After finishing his education, Pir Ilahi Bux started taking part in politics. He was elected as a member of the Sindh Legislative Assembly in 1937 in the election held under the 1935 Act. He got elected again by defeating influential landlords and zamindars of that time. Pir Ilahi Bux founded the Sindh United Front which aimed at separating Sindh from Bombay Presidency and which ultimately contributed significantly toward the establishment of Sindh as a separate province. Pir Ilahi Bux was inducted in the Sindh Cabinet headed by Khan Bahadur Allah Bux Soomro and was given the portfolio of education among other departments. Pir Ilahi Bux remained Education Minister for ten years. Pir Ilahi Bux having been deeply inspired by Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, soon joined the Muslim League and became one of his most trusted Lieutenants. He was an indefatigable fighter for education in Sindh and strove hard to introduce adult education and compulsory primary education in every corner of the province. Deeply committed to the cause of education, he successfully steered the Sindh University Act through the Sindh Assembly. Quaid-e-Azam was deeply moved by this act of Pir Illahi Bux and personally donated Rs. 150,000I towards the University at that time. Pir Ilahi Bux was one of the pioneers of S.M.

Pir Sahib was always proud to have been nominated as the Chief Minister of Sindh by no less than the Quaid- e-Azam himself. He was also the founder of Sindh University and was the prime mover of the establishment of Urdu College, Karachi. Pir Ilahi Bux was deeply perturbed over the mass influx of Muslim refugees from India during the early period of the independence of Pakistan and initiated a number of moves for the settlement of refugees in Sindh. He established the famous Pir Ilahi Buksh Colony in Karachi towards the end in 1948. He was also instrumental in inviting eminent educationists from Aligarh Muslim University, his alma mater, to serve the Muslims of Pakistan by appointing them in the Sindh University. One of such personalities was Professor A. B. A. Haleem from the Aligarh Muslim University, who was appointed by him as the first Vice Chancellor of Sindh University.

Felice Scandone is an Italian professional basketball club based in Avellino, Campania. Founded in 1948, the team has been a regular in the Lega Basket Serie A (LBA), the first tier of basketball in Italy. The club won one trophy in its existence, as it won the Italian Cup championship in 2008. Currently, the team plays in the Serie B, Italy's third tier league. History The club was founded in 1948 as Felice Scandone Sports Society (S.S.), merging with Libertas Avellino two years later and CSI-Cestistica Irpina in 1968. After going between leagues from 1974 to 1995, the club settled in Serie B1. Two seasons later, coach Gianluca Tucci guided the team to the second division Serie A2. The turn of the millennium saw the side reach the first division Serie A, placing ninth in 2001 at the end of their debut season. The next seasons were more complicated, with finishes of 14, 15, 16 and 12th place. When coach Zare Markovski, who had been coaching the side since 2002, left in 2005, the club ended the season in 17th place and should have been relegated if not for promoted Roseto's inability to play in the Serie A. Matteo Boniciolli took over coaching duties following that season and kept Avellino away from the relegation places. The 2007‚Äì08 season saw Boniciolli lead Avellino to their best ever league finish of tied second-best with a 23‚Äì11 record and a league MVP title for Marques Green, their playoffs run was cut short in the semifinals by Lottomatica Roma (the side who had finished joint second) after they had swept Capo d'Orlando in the quarterfinals. Even better for the side, players such as Green, Devin Smith and Eric Williams led Air Avellino to its first ever title ever, the 2008 Italian Cup, in its first participation in the competition, after beating La Fortezza Bologna 73‚Äì67 in the final with 18 points from the game MVP Smith. The former Scandone logo, used during the 00s, until 2017 The 2008‚Äì09 season saw Avellino make their European debut, in the elite EuroLeague. The team had a difficult period between 2011 and 2015, missing the playoffs in multiple occasions and changing the head coach almost every season. In 2016, the team led by coach Pino Sacripanti had a run of 20 victories in 26 games and reached the Italian Cup final, losing to Olimpia Milano. Avellino finished the regular season in 3rd place, and eliminated Giorgio Tesi Group Pistoia 3‚Äì0, reaching the league semifinals against Pallacanestro Reggiana, where the Hirpinian team lost the series in game 7 (4‚Äì3 overall), despite winning Game 4 by a 43 point margin. In the 2017‚Äì18 season, Scandone played its first European final after the team reached the Final of the FIBA Europe Cup. In the all-Italian final it lost to Reyer Venezia. In the following 2018‚Äì19 season, Scandone made its debut in the Basketball Champions League (BCL). The team was eliminated after the regular season.

Noctorum is in the north east of the Wirral Peninsula, bounded by the Beechwood estate to the north, Claughton and Oxton to the east and south east, and the River Fender and M53 motorway to the west. Due to a redefining of post towns by the Royal Mail in 2003, Noctorum is identified as being within Prenton (which is in fact a geographically separate suburb of Birkenhead), yet this was only a postal change and Noctorum itself still remains a part of Birkenhead. At the 2001 census the population of Noctorum was 4,990. For the 2011 census no population figures specific to Noctorum were available. However the total population of Claughton Ward, which includes Noctorum, was 14,705. History The name Noctorum is Old Irish in origin, originally Cnocc T√≠rim, meaning \\"Dry Hill\\". This may be in reference to Bidston Hill, of which Noctorum is situated on its western slope. The name may long pre-date the Norse-Irish settlement in the early 10th century and go back to a Hibernian settlement of the west coast in the Sub-Roman period (early 5th century). Noctorum appears as Chenoterie (Norman French) in the Domesday Book of 1086. \\"Ch√™ne\\" (French for oak) may be used here as in the Wirral hamlet of Landican (Old Welsh/Brythonic) called Landechene, the Oak Enclosure in the Norman French of the Doomsday Book. Noctorum was a township of the parish of Woodchurch, in the Wirral Hundred. It existed as a civil parish from 1866 until 1933 when it was added to Birkenhead civil parish. The same year Noctorum was subsumed into the County Borough of Birkenhead, within the county of Cheshire. On 1 April 1974, local government reorganisation in England and Wales resulted in most of the Wirral Peninsula, including Noctorum, transfer from the county of Cheshire to the nascent county of Merseyside. The population was recorded at 17 in 1801, 32 in 1851, 212 in 1901 and 473 in 1931. Geography Noctorum is in the northern part of the Wirral Peninsula, approximately south-south-east of the Irish Sea at Leasowe, east-north-east of the Dee Estuary at Caldy and west of the River Mersey at Tranmere. Noctorum is situated on the western side of the Bidston to Storeton ridge, with the area at an elevation of between above sea level. Governance Noctorum is within the parliamentary constituency of Birkenhead. The current Member of Parliament is Mick Whitley, a Labour representative. He has been the MP since 2019. At local government level, Noctorum is incorporated into the Claughton Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in the metropolitan county of Merseyside. It is represented on Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council by three councillors. The most recent local elections took place on 2 May 2019. Landmarks Noctorum Lane Noctorum Lane is the site of the Grade II listed buildings Mere Hall and Rathmore. Both large houses were designed by Edmund Kirby and built in the 1880s. Community Ridgeway High School and the Discovery City Learning Centre (containing Ridgeway Library) is situated within this suburb. There is also a large council estate located here.

Annes Grove Gardens Started by Richard Grove Annesley, in the grounds of a house near Fermoy dating from the early eighteenth century. Home to many Himalayan rhododendrons, some from seeds collected by Captain Frank Kingdon-Ward in Burma and Tibet in 1924. The garden, on the River Blackwater has a unique water garden to which William Robinson devoted a chapter in his publication The English Flower Garden. , Ardnagashel House On the shores of Bantry Bay, home of the Hutchins family and of the botanist Ellen Hutchins, who, guided by the Director of Kew Gardens made an arboretum. This included Podocarpus salignus, among the finest in Ireland or Britain. Many Himalayan trees and shrubs were subsequently added by a later proprietor, Colonel Kaulback, who had accompanied Frank Kingdon-Ward on one of his Himalayan plant expeditions in the 1920s. Samuel Hutchins 1834-1915 returned from Australia in 1858 with one hundred packets of seeds of Australian plants. Earlier plantings were made by Arthur 1770‚Äì1838, his brother Emmanuel 1785-1815 and Ellen 1785-1815 (also a botanical illustrator). The area's history was recorded in 1980 by John Bevan: 'Ardnagashel-A Hidden Treasure'. Ashbourne House Mr. R.H. Beamish laid out his alpine and sub- tropical gardens at Glounthaune in 1900. Included were plants from China introduced by E.H. Wilson and from New Zealand by Captain Dorrien Smith of Tresco Abbey in the Scilly Isles. Notable species include Haplocartha scaposa introduced from South Africa by Mr. Beamish, together with the rare Mexican White Pine (Pinus ayacahuite), the tallest in Ireland and Britain. Ballintober Near Kinsale is a lost demesne, which was noted in the late 17th century for its elaborate gardens (Rosemary ffolliott, The Poles of Mayfield, Dublin 1958, plate 1X, p151). Bantry House The first phase of the garden lay-out was carried out by Lord Bantry between 1791 and 1795. The work was continued by his eldest son Richard (Viscount Berehaven) between 1844 and 1868, and influenced by his wide continental travels. Extensive restoration has recently been carried out on the gardens. , Belgrove Gardens Great Island near Cobh on Cork Harbour was established by William Edward Gumbleton (1840‚Äì1911). He obtained species and varieties from the heads of botanical institutions all over the world. The garden was a cross between trial grounds and a botanical garden. Fruit trials featured in the garden. The writer and garden designer William Robinson in 1899 dedicated a volume of The Garden to Gumbleton. Gumbleton had one of the best botanical libraries in Europe and on his death he bequeathed these to the Irish National Botanic Gardens in Dublin. The garden no longer survives. Besborough Home of Ebenezer Pike, located in Blackrock just outside Cork. Noted for its collection of 'Desfontainea spinosa'. The House and grounds was later acquired by a religious order of nuns.

Cork Botanic Gardens The Royal Cork Institution was set up in 1803 and received a Parliamentary grant of two thousand pounds per year. The Governors decided to establish a botanical garden, and in 1807 leased a site at 'Lilliput', Ballypehane, Cork. In 1808 they employed Scotsman James Drummond (1787‚Äì1863) to lay out the gardens. In 1822 the garden was described (Power: Botanist's guide to the County of Cork, 1845) as having approximately six acres and a glasshouse in a walled enclosure of . Drummond was a noted field botanist during his time in Cork (and subsequently in Western Australia). The Government grant was withdrawn in 1830 and the Governors declined Drummond's offer to lease the gardens and opted to surrender the lease. The lands were then let to Fr. Mathew of Temperance fame for a cemetery which use still continues. The only current evidence of the gardens is a cedar tree. , , Creagh Established by the Harold-Barry family on the shores of Baltimore Bay, near Skibbereen. Contains a mixture of native and exotic planting, including 'The Ho Che Min Trail'. Formerly open to the public as part of the West Cork Garden Trail, but no longer so following a change of ownership. , , Drombrow House Two miles from Bantry in the Mealagh Valley. The property was owned by the White family from the 1790s until 1853 when Major Arthur Wilkinson bought it. After 1880 Drombow Lake was selected for a reservoir; this gave the impetus to Arthur Berkeley Wilkinson to build a series of water gardens, dedicated to the cultivation of water lilies. The gardens also contained a range of wayside flowers supplied from Glasnevin, and in turn Drombrow supplied Glasnevin with bamboo, waterlily, phlox and butterwort. After Wilkinson's death the estate was neglected and the water garden fell into disrepair . Fota Island Home to the Smith-Barry family, Fota is located eight miles (13 km) from Cobh on Cork Harbour. Hugh Smith-Barry (1816‚Äì57) reclaimed tidal margins} from the sea and planted shelter-belts of fir, establishing a fruit garden and arboretum. His son Lord Barrymore with his gardener William Osborne continued with the planting of exotics including Nordmann Fir (Abies nordmanniana) from the Caucasus in 1838. The tradition of planting continued under the more recent ownership of University College Cork. The house, arboretum and gardens are now managed by a Trust, the remainder of the island being divided between a wildlife park and a golf course. Garnish Island Designed by Harold Peto for the owner Annan Bryce in 1910, this island garden, occasionally known as Ilnacullin (or sometimes as Garinish Island) or The Italian Gardens, was bequeathed to the Irish people in 1953.

History The name Frankby come from the Old Norse Frankis- b√Ωr, likely referring to \\"Frank's/Franki's (Frenchman's) farm or settlement\\". Although it could also be interpreted as a personal name. The \\"b√Ωr\\" suffix, included in neighbouring place names such as Greasby, Irby and Pensby, applies to settlements believed to be Viking in origin. The settlement of Frankby was supposedly mentioned in the Domesday Book entry for neighbouring Greasby. Eight households are recorded: \\"3 villagers. 1 smallholder. 2 slaves. 2 Frenchmen.\\" The name has been variously spelt over time as Frankeby (1230), Fraunkbi (1346) and Fraunkeley (1421). =Civic history= Frankby was formerly a township in the West Kirby parish of the Wirral Hundred.

The relations between the two are framed in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the Union for the Mediterranean. Among the ENP countries, Morocco has been recognised an advanced status, opening up to high levels of political cooperation. The main legal ties between Morocco and the EU are set by the 2000 Association Agreement. Several other agreement cover sectoral issues, including the 2006 EU-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the 2006 Open Skies agreement.  Legal ties between Morocco and the European Union  Diplomatic relations between Morocco and the European Union date back to 1960, when a commercial agreement was concluded. In 1976 a first co-operation agreement was signed. At the 1995 Barcelona conference the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership was inaugurated, establishing a policy with ambitious and long- term objectives in the fields of the political and security partnership, the economic and financial partnership and cooperation in social, cultural and human affairs. The beginning of King Mohammed VI's reign marked a major shift toward more cooperation, comprehension and partnership. In order to improve the Euro-Mediterranean Cooperation, the Union and Morocco have set up the EU‚ÄìMorocco Association Agreement. This document, dated 1 March 2000, is the legal basis for relations between Morocco and the EU. With the inauguration of the European Neighbourhood Policy and of the Union for the Mediterranean, Morocco and the EU have drafted and adopted an ENP Action Plan in July 2005, delineating the next steps of cooperation. Under the Neighbourhood Action Plan Morocco has embarked on a major effort to align itself on the legislation and standards of the EU. This should enable it to gradually exploit the possibilities offered by the Neighbourhood Policy, and in particular progress beyond the existing relations towards a significant degree of integration; this includes allowing Morocco to participate in the internal market and taking part gradually in EU programmes. This will require a great effort by Morocco to create the necessary legislative and institutional conditions. This ambition is reflected in Morocco's advanced status with the EU which is \\"more than association, less than accession\\". With the Advanced Status granted to Morocco on 13 October 2008, the partnership acquired a high-level political cooperation level. The first EU-Morocco summit took place on March 7, 2010.http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/newsbriefs/general/2009/12/08/newsbrief-04 = Bilateral agreements = Fisheries agreements (the latest being the 2006 EU‚ÄìMorocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement, FPA) have been periodically signed between Morocco and the EU since the 1980s, allowing European vessels (especially Spanish and Portuguese) to fish in Moroccan waters in exchange for a monetary contribution. Since 2000 Morocco and the EU have signed many bilateral agreements. Various agreements of free trade that Morocco ratified with its principal economic partners like the Euro-Mediterranean free trade area agreement. The two sides recently announced plans to extend their Free Trade Agreement to cover not only goods, but also agriculture and services, giving Morocco almost the same deal with Europe as member states have with each other. Those agreements are parts of the Euro-Mediterranean free trade area signed in Barcelona, Spain in 1995. Morocco and the EU have also signed an open-skies agreement. The agreement is Europe's first ever outside its borders. It came into force in summer 2006. In 2017, Federica Mogherini, the foreign minister of the European Union, stirred controversy and diplomatic confusion over her statement that the trade agreements between Morocco and the EU would not be affected by the 2016 ruling by the European Court of Justice on the scope of trade with Morocco. This ruling confirmed that bilateral trade deals, such as the EU‚ÄìMorocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement, covers only agricultural produce and fishing products originating within the internationally recognized borders of Morocco, thus explicitly excluding any product sourced from Western Sahara or its territorial waters. The international community, including the EU, unanimously rejects Morocco's territorial claim to Western Sahara.https://www.reuters.com/article/eu- morocco/eu-to-uphold-morocco-farm-accord-despite-western-sahara-ruling- idUSL5N1FS5V1https://euobserver.com/economic/135063https://www.politico.eu/article/the- eus-morocco-problem-western-sahara-trade- judgment/https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2016/12/21/european-court- dismisses-moroccos-claim-to-western-sahara-throwing-eu-trade-deal-into-doubt/ =Membership application= In 1987, Morocco applied to join the European Communities (the precursor to the European Union). The application was rejected on the grounds that Morocco was not considered to be a \\"European country\\" and hence could not join. This geographic membership criterion was later enshrined in the Copenhagen criteria. The rejection was expected as the King had sent feelers two years prior and received such a response. Economic cooperation Morocco tops the list of partners that benefited from the European Union's financial support as part of neighbourhood assistance, receiving about 205 million euro in 2009http://www.moroccobusinessnews.com/Content/Article.asp?idr=20&id;=1392 (‚Ç¨654 million for 2007‚Äì2010). In order to help the country in this new statutory phase in bilateral relations, the EU will increase aid for the period 2011-2013. In December 2009, the EU granted Morocco a donation of MAD 771 million (US$100 million) to promote investments and exports, and contribute to the financing of the Rabat-Sal√© tramway project.http://www.map.ma/eng/sections/economy/eu_grants_morocco/viewhttp://www.moroccobusinessnews.com/Content/Article.asp?idr=20&id;=1290 =Financial protocols (1977‚Äì1996)= Under the four financial protocols of the 1976 Cooperation AgreementAgreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Morocco signed between the European Community (predecessor of the EU) and Morocco, Morocco received a total of ‚Ç¨1091 million, including ‚Ç¨574 million from the Community budget and of ‚Ç¨518 million in the form of loans from EIB own resources. The protocols gave sectoral priority to rural development (46%). Other sectors of activity were, in order of importance: economic infrastructure (17%), the social sector (15.6%), the private sector (10%), vocational training (10%) and civil society (0.4%). =MEDA programme= The Meda programme (adopted in July 1996) is the EU's principal financial instrument for the implementation of the Euro- Mediterranean Partnership. The budgetary resources allocated under Meda were ‚Ç¨3.4 billion for 1995‚Äì1999 and ‚Ç¨5.4 billion for 2000‚Äì2006. Morocco has become the principal beneficiary of the Meda programme, with commitments totalling ‚Ç¨1.472 million for 1995‚Äì2006, of which ‚Ç¨660 million under Meda I (1995‚Äì1999) and ‚Ç¨812 million under Meda II (2000‚Äì2006). Meda cooperation touched all socio-economic spheres in Morocco. Several structural adjustment programmes were set up in essential sectors such as finance, taxation, water, transport, health, education, the civil service, plus twinnings and exchanges in services such as customs, the environment, youth, transport and justice. Investment programmes were implemented to support enterprise development, vocational training in the tourism, textile, and information and communication technology sectors, the development of the national road transport such as the Mediterranean \\"rocade\\" and the rural network, integrated rural infrastructure development, and water and sanitation programmes in rural areas (PAGER), measures to deal with unhealthy habitats to get rid of slums and improve access to social facilities. Meda funds were also channelled to migration, with the aim of fostering a better management of migratory flows. Financial cooperation also concerned environmental protection and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In the period 1996‚Äì2006 Morocco received financing totalling approximately ‚Ç¨15 million under horizontal EU budget lines, in particular Meda democracy, the environment, LIFE, the ECIP, the fight against AIDS, NGO cofinancing, and the fight against drugs, plus ‚Ç¨10 million under the budget lines for the 5th and 6th Framework Research, Technology and Development Programmes, in which more than 160 Moroccan teams participated. Political cooperation In 2006 the EU commissioner for external relations, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, declared that \\"we [EU] already have a very, very close relationship with Morocco, and we're studying giving them even more advanced status\\". In 2008, Morocco was the first country in the region to be granted advanced status, which makes it a pioneer in the European Neighbourhood Policy. The agreement constitutes a \\"roadmap\\" which widens the sphere of EU-Morocco bilateral relations by setting out new objectives in three main areas: closer political relations, with the holding of a periodic EU-Morocco summit and the establishment of consultation mechanisms at ministerial level; integration of the single market on the basis of gradual adoption of the Community acquis and sectoral cooperation; and a focus on the human dimension. The first EU‚ÄìMorocco summit was held March 7, 2010. It was the first of its kind between the EU and an Arab or African country.http://www.map.ma/eng/sections/main2/hm_the_king_sends_me/view Abbas El Fassi, Van Rompuy and Barroso presented to the press the results of the summit, commending the event which heralds a new era in the privileged and strategic partnership. The Granada summit between the European Union and Morocco has concluded with a positive assessment of the development of their relations and with the commitment to build on their political, economic and social aspect, as well as to begin a process of reflection on their future 'contractual' form. On bilateral partnership, the joint declaration sets concrete measures to consolidate achievements and an operational agenda for the future, as part of the advanced status which specifies the relation between Morocco and the EU. The summit also addressed the state of EU‚ÄìMorocco relations and future developments, as well as other subjects of common interest such as the legal status of Western Sahara, the situation in the Maghreb and the Sahel, and the Union for the Mediterranean. European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy ≈†tefan F√ºle visited Morocco in January 2012. He said he was very pleased with the reform developments and the country is going in the right direction, but some improvements still need to be made and the Nation are currently working on it. =Issues= Illegal immigration and terrorism have already replaced issues on the agenda that were important before, such as trade (i.e. agriculture and fishing) and drug trafficking. Starting in 2000, Moroccan and EU authorities have been keen to work together more closer with intelligence sharing and border control cooperation. Human rights was an issue that curved Morocco‚ÄìEU relationships for decades. Now, many European officials have lauded the efforts Morocco has made in the human rights field. Another hot issue concerns territorial disputes. In July 2002, there was a skirmish between Spain and Morocco during the Perejil incident. Though tensions have eased since the coming of the Spanish Socialist party to power, the two Spanish exclaves of Ceuta and Melilla are still an obstacle between the two neighbouring countries. In October 2006 a diplomatic controversy was sparked between Morocco and Spain when Morocco had denied entry from Ceuta of a Spanish aid package consisting of 150 patrol vehicles to fight illegal immigration. This was later resolved by delivering the goods 50 km off Tangier's coast.Associated Press. \\"Spain to go ahead with aid package that turned into diplomatic incident with Morocco\\". International Herald Tribune. Archived from the original on 16 November 2006. Accessed 29 March 2018. The Western Sahara conflict has always been on the agenda. Morocco has long been seeking a formal European recognition of its claimed rights over the disputed territory.

Leading up to Calday Grange Grammar School History The name of the village means \\"new settlement or farmstead\\" from the Old English words nƒ´we and t≈´n. Newton was previously combined with the nearby hamlet of Larton as Newton cum Larton, part of West Kirby parish of the Wirral Hundred, in the county of Cheshire. Its population was 49 in 1801 and 44 in 1851. A civil parish from 1866, it was abolished in 1889 and subsumed into the nearby civil parish of Grange. Between 1894 and 1933 Newton was part of Wirral Rural District, then Hoylake Urban District until 1974. Geography Two branches of Newton Brook border the north and the east of Newton.

Antigens from the human ABO blood group system are also found in apes and Old World monkeys, and the types trace back to the origin of humanoids. Other animal blood sometimes agglutinates (to varying levels of intensity) with human blood group reagents, but the structure of the blood group antigens in animals is not always identical to those typically found in humans. The classification of most animal blood groups therefore uses different blood typing systems to those used for classification of human blood. Simian blood groups Two categories of blood groups, human-type and simian-type, have been found in apes and monkeys, and they can be tested by methods established for grouping human blood. Data is available on blood groups of common chimpanzees, baboons, and macaques. =Rh blood group= The Rh system is named after the rhesus monkey, following experiments by Karl Landsteiner and Alexander S. Wiener, which showed that rabbits, when immunised with rhesus monkey red cells, produce an antibody that also agglutinates the red blood cells of many humans. =Chimpanzee and Old World monkey blood group systems= Two complex chimpanzee blood group systems, V-A-B-D and R-C-E-F systems, proved to be counterparts of the human MNS and Rh blood group systems, respectively. Two blood group systems have been defined in Old World monkeys: the Drh system of macaques and the Bp system of baboons, both linked by at least one species shared by either of the blood group systems. Canine blood groups Over 13 canine blood groups have been described. Eight DEA (dog erythrocyte antigen) types are recognized as international standards. Of these DEA types, DEA 4 and DEA 6 appear on the red blood cells of ~98% of dogs. Dogs with only DEA 4 or DEA 6 can thus serve as blood donors for the majority of the canine population. Any of these DEA types may stimulate an immune response in a recipient of a blood transfusion, but reactions to DEA 1.1+ are the most severe. Dogs that are DEA 1.1 positive (33 to 45% of the population) are universal recipients - that is, they can receive blood of any type without expectation of a life-threatening hemolytic transfusion reaction. Dogs that are DEA 1.1 negative are universal donors. Blood from DEA 1.1 positive dogs should never be transfused into DEA 1.1 negative dogs. If it is the dog's first transfusion the red cells transfused will have a shortened life due to the formation of alloantibodies to the cells themselves and the animal will forever be sensitized to DEA 1.1 positive blood. If it is a second such transfusion, life-threatening conditions will follow within hours. In addition, these alloantibodies will be present in a female dog's milk (colostrum) and adversely affect the health of DEA 1.1 negative puppies. Other than DEA blood types, Dal is another blood type commonly known in dogs. Feline blood groups A majority of feline blood types are covered by the AB blood group, which designates cats as A, B, or AB. This type is determined by the CMAH alleles a cat possess. The majority A allele seems to be dominant over the recessive B type, which is found with a higher frequency in some countries other than the United States. An \\"AB\\" type seems to be expressed by a third recessive allele. In a study conducted in England, 87.1% of non- pedigree cats were type A, while only 54.6% of pedigree cats were type A. Type A and B cats have naturally occurring alloantibodies to the opposite blood type, although the reaction of Type B cats to Type A blood is more severe than vice versa. Based on this, all cats should have a simple blood typing test done to determine their blood type prior to a transfusion or breeding to avoid the haemolytic disease (or neonatal isoerythrolysis). It is also important to check donor cats for FeLV/FIV status. An additional blood group system is Mik (+/-). It is only identified in 2007, with no specific gene mapped yet, but the prevalence of Mik- appears high enough for concern. Equine blood groups There are eight major recognized blood groups in horses. Seven of them, A, C, D, K, P, Q, and U, are internationally recognized, with an eighth, T, which is primarily used in research. Each blood group has at least two allelic factors (for example, the A blood group has a, b, c, d, e, f, and g), which can be combined in all combinations (Aa, Afg, Abedg, etc.), to make many different alleles. This means that horses can have around 400,000 allelic combinations, allowing blood testing to be used as an accurate method of identifying a horse or determining parentage. Unlike humans, horses do not naturally produce antibodies against red blood cell antigens that they do not possess; this only occurs if they are somehow exposed to a different blood type, such as through blood transfusion of transplacental hemorrhage during parturition. Breeding a mare to a stallion with a different blood type, usually Aa or Qa blood, risks neonatal isoerythrolysis if the foal inherits the blood type of the stallion. Group C is also of some degree of concern. This can also occur if a mare is bred to a jack, due to a \\"donkey factor\\". This immune-mediated disease is life-threatening and often requires transfusion. Ideally, cross-matching should be performed prior to transfusion, or a universal donor may be used. The ideal universal whole blood donor is a non-thoroughbred gelding that is Aa, Ca, and Qa negative. If this is not available, a gelding, preferably of the same breed as the patient, may be used as a donor, and cross-matching may be crudely accessed by mixing donor serum with patient blood. If the mixture agglutinates, the donor blood contains antibodies against the blood of the patient, and should not be used. Bovine blood groups The polymorphic systems in cattle include the A, B, C, F, J, L, M, S, and Z polymorphisms. References Further reading *Boyd, WC.

Roma  NASA view of greenhouses at El Ejido on the Campo de Dal√≠as, Spain. Environmental racism has been documented in Spain, with North African and Romani ethnic communities being particularly affected, as well as migrant agricultural workers from throughout Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Southeast Europe. As of 2007, there were an estimated 750,000 Romani (primarily Gitano Romani) living in Spain. According to the \\"Housing Map of the Roma Community in Spain, 2007\\", 12% of Romani live in substandard housing, while 4%, or 30,000 people, live in slums or shantytowns; furthermore, 12% resided in segregated settlements. According to the Roma Inclusion Index 2015, the denial of environmental benefits has been documented in some communities, with 4% of Romani in Spain not having access to running water, and 9% not having access to electricity. Efforts to relocate shantytowns (chabolas), which according to a 2009 report by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights were disproportionately inhabited by Romani persons, gained momentum in the late 1980s and 1990s. These initiatives were ostensibly designed to improve Romani living conditions, yet also had the purpose of being employed to vacate plots of real estate for development. In the words of a 2002 report on the situation of Romani in Spain, \\"thousands of Roma live in transitional housing, without any indication of when the transition period will end,\\" a situation which has been attributed to the degradation of many transitional housing projects into ghettoes. In the case of many such relocations, Romani people have been moved to the peripheries of urban centers, often in environmentally problematic areas. In the case of Ca√±ada Real Galiana, diverse ethnic groups including non-Romani Spaniards and Moroccans have been documented as experiencing issues of environmental injustice alongside Romani communities.Rubio, Luc√≠a Asu√© Mbom√≠o. \\"The Invisible City: Voices in the Ca√±ada Real Galiana\\" (film dossier).

Map excerpt of Valdeming√≥mez district, Ca√±ada Real Galiana, Madrid. The long grey strip along Ca√±ada Real Galiana roadway and transhumance trail denotes the 16 kilometre-long, 75 metre-wide shantytown where 8,600 persons reside. Rectangular shapes denote structures. On the outskirts of Madrid, 8,600 persons inhabit the informal settlement of Ca√±ada Real Galiana, also known as La Ca√±ada Real Riojana or La Ca√±ada Real de las merinas. It constitutes the largest shantytown in Western Europe. The settlement is located along 16 kilometres of a 75 metre-wide, 400 kilometre-long environmentally protected transhumance trail between Getafe and Coslada, part of a 125,000 kilometre network of transhumance routes throughout Spain. Certain areas of the unplanned and unauthorized settlement are economically affluent, working- class, or middle-class and are viewed as desirable areas for many (particularly Moroccan immigrants who have faced discrimination in the broader Spanish rental market). However, much of the Ca√±ada Real Galiana is subject to severe environmental racism, particularly in the Valdeming√≥mez district of the settlement. = Migrant agricultural workers in Southern Spain = Throughout southern Spain, migrant workers from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and South East Europe employed in the agricultural sector have experienced housing and labour conditions that could be defined as environmental racism, producing food for larger European society while facing extreme deprivations. In Murcia, lettuce pickers have complained of having to illegally work for salary by volume for employment agencies, instead of by the hour, meaning they are required to work more hours for less pay, while also experiencing unsafe exposure to pesticides. Workers have alleged that they have been forced to work in fields while pesticide spraying is active, a practice which is illegal under Spanish work safety laws. Beginning in the 2000s in the El Ejido region of Andalusia, African (including large numbers of Moroccan) immigrant greenhouse workers have been documented as being faced with severe social marginalization and racism while simultaneously being exposed to extremely difficult working conditions with significant exposure to toxic pesticides. The El Ejido region has been described by environmentalists as a \\"sea of plastic\\" due to the expansive swaths of land covered by greenhouses, and has also been labeled \\"Europe's dirty little secret\\" due to the documented abuses of workers who help produce large quantities of Europe's food supply.Greenhouses at El EjidoIn these greenhouses, workers are allegedly required to work under \\"slave-like\\" conditions in temperatures as high as 50 degrees Celsius with nonexistent ventilation, while being denied basic rest facilities and earning extremely low wages, among other workplace abuses. As of 2015, out of 120,000 immigrant workers employed in the greenhouses, 80,000 are undocumented and not protected by Spanish labour legislation, according to Spitou Mendy of the Spanish Field Workers Syndicate (SOC). Workers have complained of ill health effects as a result of exposure to pesticides without proper protective equipment. Following the killing of two Spanish farmers and a Spanish woman in two separate incidents involving Moroccan citizens in February 2000, an outbreak of xenophobic violence took place in and around El Ejido, injuring 40 and displacing large numbers of immigrants.EFE.

According to the PEK Report, results of the evaluation were inconclusive, and in June 2005, the five complementary therapies under evaluation - anthroposophical medicine, homeopathy, neural therapy, phytotherapy and traditional Chinese medicine (more precisely, traditional Chinese herbal therapy) - were removed from the list of services covered by the compulsory health insurance scheme (KLV).

Accessed August 2007. =Background= Following the decision taken by the Swiss Federal Department of Home Affairs (DHA) on 9 July 1998, five complementary therapies - anthroposophical medicine, homeopathy, neural therapy, phytotherapy and traditional Chinese medicine (more precisely, traditional Chinese herbal therapy) - were included on 1 July 1999 for a limited period (until 30 June 2005) in the list of services covered by the compulsory health insurance scheme (KLV). These five services were only eligible for reimbursement if they were provided by physicians who had the relevant proficiency certificates, issued by the Swiss Medical Association (FMH). The decision on whether these complementary methods would be retained within the basic health insurance scheme was to be based on their efficacy, appropriateness and cost-effectiveness being demonstrated. To this end, the Complementary Medicine Evaluation Programme (PEK) was carried out from 1998 to 2005. =Design of the PEK= A basic procedure was defined, comprising two parts. In Part 1 (evaluation of the provision of complementary medicine for patients in Switzerland), empirical studies were to be carried out, permitting conclusions as to: :a) how prevalent the five therapies are in Switzerland, :b) which physicians offer these therapies, :c) which patients have recourse to them, :d) what results are achieved with these treatments, and :e) what impact these therapies have on costs. For points b), c), and e), comparisons were made with conventional medicine. On account of methodological and time- related problems, however, point d) could not be evaluated. In Part 2 (literature analysis), the literature available internationally on efficacy, appropriateness (here primarily defined in terms of safety and utilization) and cost-effectiveness was to be systematically compiled and reviewed. =Outcomes= Part 1 was carried out by a team from the Panmedion Foundation, a pro-CAM think tank.

Grapow & Ermann, vol. 5, 288.2-289.23 and refers to formally written ethical teachings focused on the \\"way of living truly\\". Sebayt is considered an Egyptian form of wisdom literature. Examples In Eulogy of Dead Writers, written during the Twentieth Dynasty of the New Kingdom, a stanza lists the names of writers famous for their great works, most of whom are authors of noted sebayt from the Middle Kingdom: Each of these authors (excepting Imhotep, none of whose works survive) including Ptahemdjehuty,http://fs2.american.edu/dfagel/www/LoyalistInstruction.pdf can be attested as authors of various works from the Middle Kingdom. Many of the earliest Sebayt claim to have been written in the third millennium BCE, during the Old Kingdom, but it is now generally agreed that they were actually composed later, beginning in the Middle Kingdom (c.1991‚Äì1786 BCE). This fictitious attribution to authors of a more distant past was perhaps intended to give the texts greater authority. Perhaps the best-known sebayt is the one which claims to have been written by Ptahhotep, the vizier to the Fifth Dynasty pharaoh Djedkare Isesi, who ruled from 2388‚Äì2356 BCE. Ptahhotep's sebayt is often called The Maxims of Ptahhotep or the Maxims of Good Discourse (the latter being a phrase used as a self-description in the sebayt itself).Lichtheim, pp.61ff. The teaching appears on the Twelfth Dynasty Prisse Papyrus along with the ending of the Instructions of Kagemni.Simpson (1972), p. 177; Parkinson (2002), pp. 313-315. Another well known sebayt was attributed to the Fourth Dynasty ethicist named Hardjedef. Only a few fragments survive of his Instruction.Lichtheim, pp.58ff. Two sebayt are attributed to Egyptian rulers themselves. The first of these is entitled the Teaching for King Merykara, who lived during the troubled First Intermediate Period (2150‚Äì2040 BCE). The document claims to be written by Merykara's father, the preceding monarch. However, since Merykara and his father were kings of the unstable periods of the Ninth through Tenth Dynasties, almost nothing else is known of them, and it is quite likely that the text was composed at a later period.Lichtheim, pp.97ff. The other royal teaching is the Instructions of Amenemhat. This sebayt was reputedly authored by Amenemhat I, the founder of the Twelfth Dynasty, who ruled from 1991‚Äì1962 BCE, but was probably composed after his death.Lichtheim, pp.135ff. It should be mentioned that Amenemhat I was the first pharaoh to rule after the First Intermediate Period, and thus the instructions of Amenemhat are connected to his attempt to consolidate power typified by the Prophecy of Neferti, as alluded to in the Eulogy. Thus both regnal sebayt are directly connected to the Intermediate Period and its aftermath. Although not attributed to a pharaoh, the Loyalist Teaching stress the virtues of remaining obedient and respectful to the ruler of Egypt. Sebayt were a long lived genre, with new compositions continuously appearing well into the Roman era. Some individual teachings, such as the Teaching of Amenemhat I (written c. 1950 BCE) were continuously copied and transmitted for over 1500 years. Most Sebayt are preserved on papyrus scrolls that are copies of earlier works. Four important examples of sebayt are preserved in the Prisse Papyrus, two papyrus scrolls in the British Museum, the Insinger Papyrus and the Carnarvon Tablet 1 in Cairo. This genre has much in common with sapiential literature in other cultures, and is for example comparable with the Old Testament Book of Proverbs which has in part been connected to the Instruction of Amenemope.Lichtheim, p146-163.

She was a Croatian medievalist of the 20th century. A substantial part of the work was devoted to criticism of medieval sources. Academic career Nada Klaiƒá was born in Zagreb, the granddaughter of the historian Vjekoslav Klaiƒá and sister of landscape architect Smiljan Klaiƒá. She was a university professor and a prominent Croatian medievalist, graduated at the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Zagreb, the same faculty where she was involved in teaching for 45 years. She started her teaching and scientific career at the Faculty's Department of History in 1943, to become a full professor of the Croatian medieval history in 1969. This position she held until her death in 1988. Since 1946, when she took her doctor's degree with the thesis Politiƒçko i dru≈°tveno ureƒëenje Slavonije za Arpadoviƒáa (Political and Social Organization of Slavonia under the √Årp√°d dynasty), she spent several decades engaged in researching Croatian medieval history. Nada Klaiƒá gathered the results of her extensive analytical investigations, published first in journals and proceedings, and monographs and surveys of Croatian history. Historical studies She researched the period from the arrival of the Slavs (see Migration Period) until the 19th century. Under the early influence of M. Barada, Lj. Hauptmann, B. Grafenauer and J. ≈†idak, she contributed to the Croatian Medievalism by writing papers about social history. The book History of the Yugoslav Peoples II (1959) includes her comprehensive overview of the history of Croatia in the Early Modern Times, including elements of economic and social history. She paid special attention to the history of cities, as shown by several studies and books: Zadar in the Middle Ages until 1409 (with Ivo Petricioli, 1976), Zagreb in the Middle Ages (1982), Notes on Vukovar in the Middle Ages (1983), Trogir in the Middle Ages: Public Life of the City and its Inhabitants (1985), Koprivnica in the Middle Ages (1987). She authored numerous works regarding revolts and social conflicts, which she collected in the book Social Turmoil and Revolts in Croatia in the 16th and 17th Centuries (1976). She described the role of specific nobles in the books The Last Dukes of Celje in the Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen (1982) and Medvedgrad and its Masters (1987). Much of her work is the analysis and publication of historical sources. Relying partly on the contributions of earlier historians, she analyzed the entire Croatian diplomatic material of the Early Middle Ages (Diplomatic Analysis of the Documents from the Age of Croatian Rulers of Croat Descent, 1965, 1966‚Äì67), questioning its authenticity. Along with the anonymous Split chronicle called Historia Salonitana maior (1967), Klaiƒá published several sources translated from Latin for the needs of students (Sources for Croatian History before 1526, 1972). She provided a comprehensive and original concept of the early medieval development of the Croatian lands in the book History of the Croats in the Early Middle Ages (1971), while she collected her writings about numerous problems of the later period in the book History of the Croats in the High Middle Ages (1976). Her posthumously published books are Medieval Bosnia: Political Status of Bosnian Rulers before the Coronation of Tvrtko in 1377 (1989) and History of the Croats in the Middle Ages (1990). Influence Klaiƒá was one of the most prominent Croatian and Yugoslavian medievalist in the 20th century. Some of her achievements are the innovative and modern approach to Croatian history (especially for the Middle Ages), which helped release it from the romantic nationalism of the 19th century, and the revaluation of older historical sources. However, a substantial portion of her views and conclusions are controversial and the work provoked strong reactions in historiography. For example, that the document Pacta conventa is a forgery probably made in the 14th century, her \\"lack of opinion\\" over the matter of 1102 in a 1959 article disputing Croatian writer Oleg Mandiƒá's earlier work on the matter, and her view on the Croatian migration and old homeland in the 7th century, as well other topics of the early Croatian history. Klaiƒá was highly critical about the work by some scholars like Ferdo ≈†i≈°iƒá (which she dismissed as poorly analysed), or Lj. Hauptmann (regarding the thesis of Croats migration from White Croatia and the Iranian-Caucasian theory of the origin of early Croats). Her firm assumptions on the origin and early homeland of Croats based on Margetiƒá's thesis whereby the Croats arrived to Dalmatia in the late 8th or early 9th century, although Margetiƒá emphasized it was only an assumption, which he later reportedly rejected. The German and Austrian scholars H. Kunstmann, J. Herrmann, R. Werner and O. Kronsteiner loose considerations on Slavs were especially influential on her viewpoints. Klaiƒá posited that there was no Slavic migration from North to South, but rather from South to North, as the Slavs were indigenous to the Balkan, therefore was no migration of the so-called White Croats from the White Croatia in Carantania. She supported the thesis by H. Kunstmann that Slavs did not have their own tribal names, and their names should be traced to the Illyrian, Greek and Byzantine cultural milieu. She believed the Croats were Slavs in the Avar Khaganate ruled by the Avars, and as such firmly considered that Croatian state organization and titles ≈æupan and ban were of Avar origin. She thought the discovered graves which dated from before the 9th century belonged to the Avars, not Croats, and that the Avars lived in Dalmatia. This and other views, such as the Gothic administrative origin of Liburnia and the existence of Avarian ≈æupanijska Liburnia, banska Liburnia and ≈æupanijska Istria, as well her constant consideration of incompetence of the archaeologists in the absence of proof for her theories, were criticized and dismissed by modern scholars like N. Budak and P. ≈†tih as lacking bases in reliable evidence and sources. Miroslav Brandt criticised Klaiƒá as a prot√©g√© of socialist Yugoslavia in her approach to Croatian historiography.

The lake was formed glacially and is an example of a moraine-dammed lake. Llyn Peris is named after Saint Peris, an early Christian saint of whom little is known. The lake is flanked on one side by the mountain Elidir Fawr and the former slate quarry of Dinorwig. Above the opposite bank are the hills of Derlwyn and Clogwyn Mawr and a rock formation known as the Lady of Snowdon, due to its resemblance to a human face. The ruins of Dolbadarn Castle are also located on a mound above the lake. The lake now forms the lower reservoir of Dinorwig power station, and the administrative buildings for the station are situated on the lake shore. Water is released into the lake from Marchlyn Mawr (the upper reservoir) to produce electricity during periods of peak demand. This water is, in turn, pumped back to the upper reservoir using electricity purchased at off-peak periods. The water level of the lake therefore varies considerably, depending on UK electricity demand. Excess water from the lake drains into Llyn Padarn. During construction of the power station, when the capacity of the lake was increased considerably at this time, with the removal of a large quantity of slate waste, rare Welsh Arctic char fish were removed to four other lakes in the neighbouring Carneddau mountains, namely Ffynnon Llugwy, Llyn Cowlyd, Llyn Melynllyn and Llyn Dulyn, where they are still to be found.

Plot summary In post-Glasnost Moscow, the KGB stumble across an old disused training facility recreating 1960s London. They soon discover that the purpose of the facility was to integrate KGB agents into British society. Two of these agents are still missing 25 years later. In fact, the two agents have become integrated into British society so well they themselves have forgotten the reason they were sent there in the first place. They are as British as the British as far as they are concerned. One of them, Jeremy Coward, has become a successful City financier with a string of girlfriends, a posh car and a studio apartment. The other, Albert Robinson, is a hard-working moderate trade unionist living in Eccles in the north of England, with a wife, children and a council house. One day, Albert's daughter hears a strange noise coming from the attic. Looking for his daughter, Albert also hears the noise and discovers an old radio transmitter. He recognises the Russian radio transmission and suddenly realises that his old bosses are out to find him. Scared for his family, he goes away for a few days and manages to locate his associate. The KGB also begin to take action to retrieve the two rogue agents and send Major Grishina - a darkly attractive female officer - to the United Kingdom in order to bring them back to the Soviet Union. Her arrival alerts the CIA and MI5 that something big must be happening for the KGB to send such a high-ranking officer to Britain. Her arrival also shakes up the Soviet representatives in the UK. The chief KGB officer in the UK is more decadent than the locals and is originally discovered watching an American baseball game on the TV. The action unfolds as the KGB pursue the two errant agents across England - hotly pursued by the CIA and MI5.

V√§tternrundan is a cyclosportive event held annually over two weekends in June in Sweden. In 2011, 27,973 cyclists passed the finish line; 18,272 on the course, 3,686 on the course, and 6,015 on the course). The 300 km course circles Lake V√§ttern, starting and finishing in the town of Motala. Approximately 20 percent of the participants are non-Swedish and in 2011, 37 nations were represented on the course. For the 2012 event, registration for the main event was limited to a maximum of 23,000 participants. The cyclists start in groups of 60 or 70, in a two-minute interval between groups. The first group starts at 7:30 pm on Friday and the last group starts at about 5:30 am on Saturday. In 2010, a new element was introduced as the number of faster cyclists have increased: groups of cyclists aiming for completing the event in less than 9 hours can start between 9:00‚Äì9:30 am on Saturday morning. In 2011, 720 cyclists took advantage of this possibility. By allowing these cyclists to start later means that they will have fewer cyclists to pass, thus lowering the risk of incidents and accidents. The course has to be finished by midnight on Saturday. V√§tternrundan is a non-competitive event, and only measures the rider's own time using RF transponders on the helmet (mandatory equipment). An unsorted list of starting times, checkpoints passed and finishing times is published on the website after the event. This type of event is called a motionslopp (cyclosportive) in Sweden. V√§tternrundan has approximately nine stops offering food and beverages, and also first aid and free massage. At the finish line riders are awarded a medal and a certificate of achievement, and offered a meal. For safety reasons support cars and personal resupply stops are prohibited. Cyclists returning home by car are prohibited from using their cars within six hours after having finished the event, since fatigue has caused crashes‚Äîeven fatal ones. The police perform spot checks of drivers after the ride. History V√§tternrundan was first held in 1966 when 334 people completed the course. Originally the course went counter-clockwise around the lake, but turned in 1974. Note that the turning was seven years after right-hand traffic was introduced in Sweden and not therefore as a direct result as some believe. In 2011 there were still four pioneers who had completed all 41 events since 1966. The event was founded by Sten-Otto Liljedahl, a physician specialising in sports medicine; he was team doctor for the Swedish national football side from 1957 to 1970. He developed the idea of cycling around Lake V√§ttern while spending his summers in Motala, monitoring the effects of training, nutrition and exertion on the individuals participating in his trial runs. In 2011, at the start of the main event, the organisers unveiled a statue in Liljedahl's memory. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the event was cancelled in its 2020 edition. Associated events V√§tternrundan is one element of the Swedish Classic Circuit series of sporting events En svensk klassiker and an associate of the Scandinavian Circuit Tour series of cycling events Skandinavialoppet.

Born in South Africa, he played for England, being capped once at senior level for the country in 1984. Playing career =Club career= Stein started his career with Edgware Town before signing for Luton Town in 1977 under manager Harry Haslam, having been scouted by then-reserve team coach and Haslam's successor as Luton boss David Pleat. This was the first of two spells with the club, where he made 427 appearances and scored 130 goals. Initially a winger, he soon moved into a central striking role where he formed successive prolific partnerships with Bob Hatton and then Steve White as Luton won the Second Division Championship in 1981‚Äì82. The following season his striking partner in the top flight was a youngster, Paul Walsh, and Luton produced a flurry of attacking displays in the early weeks of the season, including 5‚Äì0 and 5‚Äì3 home victories over Brighton and Notts County, and a 4‚Äì4 draw away to Stoke City. To cap it all Luton then went to Anfield and surprised the Liverpool fans with Stein scoring twice past Liverpool keeper Bruce Grobbelaar, the game eventually finishing 3‚Äì3. Stein missed a substantial part of the season after breaking his foot in December, and by the last game of the season Luton needed to win away at Manchester City to stay in the top division and condemn City themselves to relegation. Stein returned for the game despite lacking match fitness, and played his part with a cross four minutes from time which fell to Raddy Antic to score the winner. The game is primarily remembered for an excited Luton manager, David Pleat, gambolling across the pitch at the final whistle to hug his players. Strike partner Walsh moved to Liverpool at the end of the 1983‚Äì4 season, and Stein then formed an equally strong partnership with Mick Harford. His finest hour came on 24 April 1988 when he scored two goals, including the late winner, in Luton's 3‚Äì2 League Cup Final victory against Arsenal. Stein was released at the end of the 1987‚Äì88 season, joining French team Caen. In 1990, he signed for another French team, Annecy. He rejoined Luton for the 1991‚Äì92 season, but Luton were relegated at the end of the season, ending a run of ten successive seasons of top flight football. He was a regular player for Luton in the 1991‚Äì92 season, but scored just three league goals. He signed for Barnet in 1992, retiring as a professional player at the end of the 1992‚Äì93 season when Barnet were promoted from Division Three despite almost going out of business during the season. =International career= On 29 February 1984 Stein played for England in 2‚Äì0 defeat against France in Paris, a game in which he partnered club teammate Paul Walsh. This was to be his only international cap. That same year he helped England win the 1984 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship. He was the first African- born black player to win a senior England cap and also the first African-born player to win a cap for the England under-21 side. Coaching career Stein returned to Luton in 2000 to work as reserve-team coach. With Mick Harford leaving for Nottingham Forest in 2004, Brian was promoted to assistant manager by then Luton manager Mike Newell. On 15 March 2007, after the sacking of Newell, Luton appointed Stein caretaker manager. He only managed Luton for one match, a 2‚Äì0 home defeat to Ipswich Town on 17 March, before being replaced by Kevin Blackwell. Blackwell brought in his own backroom staff, and Stein left Luton at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season. On 17 November 2008 Stein was appointed chief scout and first team coach at Grimsby Town, reuniting him with Mike Newell. He was promoted to the position of assistant manager on 12 May 2009 after it was decided not to renew the contract of current assistant manager Stuart Watkiss. Newell was sacked in October 2009, however Stein remained in his position as assistant at least for the next five weeks, despite early speculation that he would leave. He was overlooked for the job of caretaker manager, which instead went to youth team manager Neil Woods. When Woods received the job on a permanent basis, Stein was relieved of his duties on 30 November, and was replaced by Chris Casper.  Personal life  He is the older brother of former Luton Town, Chelsea and Stoke City striker Mark Stein; another brother, Ed Stein, played for Barnet. The Stein brothers were born in South Africa, and arrived in the United Kingdom in 1968 when their father Isaiah Stein, an activist with the African National Congress and former boxer, fled the country to escape police persecution and torture for his political activities. Isaiah continued his activism in Britain, serving as a member of the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee. Anti-apartheid activist Sam Ramsamy, a friend of Isaiah Stein and future president of the post-apartheid South African National Olympic Committee, has credited Brian Stein with encouraging other black footballers in Britain to become involved with the anti-apartheid movement, including Chris Hughton, Garth Crooks and John Fashanu.

He grew up in Newcastle upon Tyne where he now lives and works again. After graduating from Cambridge University in 1973 with a degree in history he trained as a reporter on The Journal newspaper in Newcastle upon Tyne and then became the paper's Health Correspondent. In 1977 he moved to London, becoming successively a researcher, producer, director and executive producer in London Weekend Television's current affairs and documentaries department.

In 1989 he became Head of Drama and Arts at Tyne Tees Television and was Executive Producer of the early Catherine Cookson adaptations, which ran on ITV with great success for a further decade or more. In 1991 Chaplin moved to BBC Wales as Head of Programmes where he was responsible for transforming the BBC's output in English on both television and radio. By this time Chaplin had begun to write for Live Theatre the acclaimed new writing company in Newcastle upon Tyne, collaborating first with Alan Plater on ‚ÄúIn Blackberry Time‚Äù (1988-9), a play about the life and work of his late father, Sid Chaplin. His first credit on television was the ITV mini-series ‚ÄúAct of Betrayal‚Äù about an IRA super-grass on the run in Australia, co-written with his friend and former LWT colleague Nicholas Evans (author of The Horse Whisperer and other novels). His first radio writing credit was ‚ÄúHair In The Gate‚Äù (1990) for BBC Radio 4, based on a play of the same name staged at Live Theatre the year before. In 1994, having just completed the acclaimed ITV mini-series Dandelion Dead directed by Mike Hodges and starring Michael Kitchen, about the notorious Hay on Wye poisoner Herbert Armstrong, Chaplin became a full-time writer and since then has chalked up many credits across various genres. In TV he has created the original series Grafters (1998-9) starring Robson Green and Stephen Tomkinson for ITV; and for the BBC Drovers Gold (1997) about a group of Welsh cattle drovers in the 19th century; and then Monarch of the Glen (2000-2006) starring amongst others, Richard Briers and Susan Hampshire; the series ran for 69 episodes and has been screened in many countries around the world.

The series ran from the autumn of 2014 until November 2018, with Chaplin writing a total of eight episodes. In January 2015 Radio 4 began broadcasting a series of plays by Chaplin with the generic title ‚ÄúThe Ferryhill Philosophers‚Äù about the collision between moral philosophy and life in the small town in County Durham where Chaplin spent the first three years of his life. The series, starring Alun Armstrong as retired pitman Joe Snowball and Deborah Findlay as Durham University philosophy lecturer Hermione Pink, is still running, with five of a total so far of 13 plays broadcast in the spring of 2019.

The book featured photographs by Karen Atkinson, idiosyncratic maps by Birtley Aris and an extended essay by Michael Chaplin on the social history of SW Durham, his father's so-called ‚Äòheartland‚Äô. The book is published by Mayfly Press. Chaplin has been a visiting professor at both Sunderland University (2007-2012) and Newcastle University (from 2016). He was a writer-in-residence for the Port of Tyne from 2010 to 2015 and has served on the boards of various cultural organisations in the North-East, currently the writers‚Äô development agency New Writing North and the Amber/Side Trust. Chaplin is currently writing (spring 2020) a single play also for Radio 4 titled (after a song by Sting) ‚ÄúGoing South On The Great North Road‚Äù and a new play for Live Theatre. Over the winter of 2019-20 he and his musician cousin Gary Chaplin performed an entertainment based on the story of their family, told in readings, music, images, conversation ‚Äòand cloth caps‚Äô.

It was incorporated as a non-profit organization with the name of Chebra Agudas Achim Chesed Shel Emeth on January 25, 1889. As the need grew in adjacent Jewish communities, HFBA also grew to serve the broader metropolitan area of New York City. HFBA is currently the largest free burial society outside of Israel. In 1965, it changed its official name to Chebra Agudas Achim Chesed Shel Emeth Hebrew Free Burial Association, Inc. The primary function of HFBA is to provide free burials to all indigent Jews in New York City, regardless of denominational affiliation. Burials are conducted in accordance with Jewish law. If not for HFBA, an indigent person in New York City could be buried in a mass grave in Potter's Field after lying in a morgue for up to a month, or may be transferred to medical, dental, chiropractor, occupational therapy or physical therapy schools for dissection education and/or research. HFBA, through its many contacts with City and social service agencies, is notified about Jewish decedents and makes arrangements so that every Jew receives a funeral and burial that is prompt, dignified and in keeping with Jewish traditions.  People buried  Tombstone of fire victim at the Hebrew Free Burial Association's Mount Richmond Cemetery. HFBA's clients have primarily come from among the impoverished, from the margins of society or from immigrant communities. Early in its history, they were victims of disease epidemics, occupationally hazardous conditions, poor medical care, lack of proper sanitary conditions, and high infant and mother mortality rates. In its annual report from 1900, HFBA's directors wrote, \\"What little they may have had quickly vanished for doctor's services and medicines, and even their belongings were pawned by them to obtain the wherewithal to save their loved one from the grim monster-death.\\"HFBA 1900 Annual Report In the early years of the organization's existence, the majority of burials were of small children. In 1911, HFBA provided burials for 22 young victims of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Bodies were shipped from Manila during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and at least one soldier's body arrived from New Guinea in the South Pacific during World War II. Large immigrant groups, such as Holocaust survivors and refugees from the former Soviet Union have also been prominently represented in HFBA's cemeteries, including Victor Ourin and Aaron Kuperstock, well-known Russian poets. Those who have needed HFBA's help over time have ranged from Mel Brooks' grandparents, and inmates from Rikers Island and Sing Sing prisons.  Russian community  Over the last decade, many of HFBA's clients have been from the Russian Jewish community and were elderly or ill when they arrived in the United States. Experience has shown that although their Jewish identity may have been hidden or denied in the former Soviet Union, they, or their families, expressed the desire for a proper Jewish burial. HFBA's newsletter, Chesed, has an entire section written in Russian to make sure that this community feels embraced in life as well as in death. On December 4, 2006, HFBA launched a Russian edition of their website, to further reach out to members of that community. HFBA now employs a Russian Outreach Coordinator to improve its relationships with the Russian-Jewish Community. In an effort to improve such relationships, HFBA hosted a Russian-Jewish Community Event on February 22, 2009 featuring poetry readings and a silent art auction.  Cemeteries  HFBA owns and operates two historic cemeteries on Staten Island, New York: Silver Lake Cemetery and Mount Richmond Cemetery. Established in 1892, Silver Lake Cemetery was the first cemetery used by the HFBA to bury New York‚Äôs indigent Jews. For the next seventeen years, close to 15,000 Jews from New York‚Äôs Lower East Side were buried on this gently inclined hillside. Some days saw the interment of over a dozen individuals, mostly children. Mount Richmond Cemetery was established in 1909, in response to the need for more graves for New York‚Äôs indigent Jewish community. Currently, the Hebrew Free Burial Association buries approximately 300 Jews a year, and nearly 60,000 Jews have been buried since Mt. Richmond‚Äôs inception.  Cemetery Clean-Up Project  HFBA manages a Cemetery Clean-Up Project, where groups come to Silver Lake Cemetery, and participate in its upkeep. Volunteers rake leaves and clear debris, demonstrating that the cemetery has not been forgotten, and that the Jewish Community realizes its obligation to its earlier generations.

Mexico Cozumel Island Coati taken Jan 2020 Cozumel Island Coati Family at Fury Beach, Mexico The Cozumel coati (Nasua narica nelsoni), or Cozumel Island coati, is a coati from the Mexican island of Cozumel. It is in the family Procyonidae, which also includes raccoons, olingos, and kinkajous. It has been treated as a species, but the vast majority of recent authorities treat it as a subspecies of the white- nosed coati.Kays, R. (2009). White-nosed Coati (Nasua narica), pp. 527-528 in: Wilson, D. E., and R. A. Mittermeier, eds. (2009). Handbook of the Mammals of the World. Vol. 1, Carnivores. Cozumel Island coatis are slightly smaller than the white-nosed coatis of the adjacent mainland (N. n. yucatanica); but, when compared more widely to white-nosed coatis, the difference in size is not as clear.Decker, D. M. (1991). Systematics Of The Coatis, Genus Nasua (Mammalia, Procyonidae) . Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington 104: 370-386 The level of other differences also support its status as a subspecies rather than a separate species. It has been speculated that it is the result of an ancient introduction to Cozumel by the Mayans.Nowak, R., eds. (1999). Walker's Mammals of the World. Vol. 1, p. 700. Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press University Press. Although not rated by the IUCN (where included in the widespread white-nosed coati), it is believed that the Cozumel Island coati is highly threatened and close to extinction.

The film was directed by James Foley and stars Gene Hackman and Chris O'Donnell. Plot Mississippi State Penitentiary, the setting of the film In April 1967, the office of Marvin Kramer, a Jewish civil rights lawyer in Indianola, Mississippi, is bombed by the Ku Klux Klan, killing Kramer's five-year-old twin boys and leading to the amputation of Kramer's legs and his later suicide. Klansman Sam Cayhall (Hackman) is tried for murder in the bombing, and is eventually convicted and sentenced to die in the gas chamber at the Mississippi State Penitentiary. Twenty-nine years later, in 1996, Adam Hall (O‚ÄôDonnell), a young attorney at the Chicago law firm of Kravitz and Bane, seeks assignment to the firm's pro bono representation of Cayhall in the last weeks before his scheduled execution. Adam is Sam Cayhall's grandson, his family having since moved away from the South and changed their name, haunted and shamed by Cayhall's crime. Adam is motivated to take the case in a search for some understanding of the dark secrets of his family, which prompted the suicide of Adam's father the year Sam was sentenced to death (and whose body Adam found as a child). Adam is sent by the firm to Jackson, Mississippi to take over the case and there reconnects with his aunt Lee Bowen (Dunaway), an alcoholic socialite who has managed to avoid public association with her infamous father, and who warns Adam about the dangers of dredging up the past. On death row, Sam remains a brusque, bitter, unrepentant racist who brags about his participation in the Klan bombing campaign of which the Kramer bombing was a part, though he denies that any of the bombings were intended to kill. He taunts Adam for his youth, legal inexperience, anti-racism, and the suicide of his father, but he agrees to allow Adam to represent him, though he forbids Adam from seeking clemency from Mississippi Governor McAllister, who had prosecuted Sam in his last retrial and had campaigned on that prosecution in his election to Governor. Nevertheless, as he begins to argue the case, Adam is approached by the Governor through an aide, Nora Stark (Rochon), who suggests that the Governor might consider clemency if Sam provides information about unidentified co- conspirators to the bombing. As Adam investigates, inconsistencies in the facts of the original case come to light, casting doubt on Sam's intent to kill and suggesting that he lacked the ability to make the bomb himself, and both Stark and the original FBI agent who investigated the case indicate that the bombing may have been the result of a broader conspiracy involving the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission and White Citizens' Councils, which were active at the time of the bombing in opposition to civil rights. Sam refuses to authorize Adam to seek access to the Sovereignty Commission's files, sealed by order of the state legislature, fearing it would expose Sam's former associates in the Klan, as well allowing the Governor to obtain useful information on political enemies, which he indicates is the Governor's real reason for seeking Sam's cooperation in unsealing the files. Adam continues to work through the courts, filing and arguing motions for a stay of execution, including on the grounds that Sam was legally insane and unable to tell right from wrong, due to his indoctrination into the Ku Klux Klan. At the same time, Lee, faced with the unearthed ghosts of the family history and having lapsed back into full-blown alcoholism, reveals to Adam that in the early 1950s, as children, she and Adam's father had witnessed their father murder the family's African-American neighbor, Joe Lincoln, during a fight that had started because Adam's father, Eddie, had wrongly accused Lincoln's son of stealing a toy soldier. Eddie had blamed himself for the murder, as well as Lee, for failing to stop Sam, the guilt of which was a factor in Eddie's later suicide and Lee's alcoholism. Lee also reveals how their father had been indoctrinated into the Klan as a child, showing Adam a historic photograph of Sam as a young boy attending a Klan lynching (which Adam uses in his arguments before the courts). Adam and Nora secretly gain access to the Sovereignty Commission's sealed files, which prove a wider conspiracy to the bombing, and also indicate the participation of an accomplice. The former FBI agent resurfaces, and reveals to Adam that the FBI had identified the accomplice, Rollie Wedge, whom the FBI had never been able to prove responsible, but who has reunited with other Klan members to commemorate the bombing on the eve of the pending execution. Adam goes to the Klan reunion and is beaten by several Klan members, and threatened at gunpoint by Wedge. Adam's persistence, the revelation of how much Sam's hatred had destroyed his family, and his impending execution begin to affect Sam, and he softens, reconciling with Lee and expressing remorse for his actions and the effect they have had on his family. Sam forcefully rejects the Klan when Wedge visits him in prison to encourage him to remain silent, and it is revealed that Wedge was the one who had built the bomb and set it deliberately to kill. Ultimately, Adam's motions for a stay are denied by the courts, including the United States Supreme Court. Despite Sam's finally authorizing the release of relevant Sovereignty Commission files, the Governor refuses to grant clemency, betraying him and Adam, while nonetheless using the files as political leverage (as Sam had predicted), though Wedge, identified in the files, is finally arrested. Ultimately, Sam is executed in the gas chamber, though Adam remains a confidant and advocate for his grandfather up until his execution, and he and Lee embrace at the end, in the hope that maybe the ghosts of the past are gone.

Ron Howard was originally set to direct the film for Universal. In May 1994 it was reported William Goldman was paid $1 million to write the script. Howard left the project in May 1995 because of what he described as \\"a hunch\\". He stayed on as a producer though. \\"It's a strong story, and William Goldman is doing great work on the screenplay.\\" Brad Pitt was committed to playing Adam Hall, but left the project when Howard left to direct Ransom. William Goldman described the project as a \\"total wipeout disaster... a terrible experience\\" and never saw the finished movie. Filming locations Scenes were filmed in a photo realistic recreation of the gas chamber on studio sets in Los Angeles. Other locations were filmed in Chicago, Jackson, Mississippi, Indianola, Mississippi, Greenwood, Mississippi, and Parchman, Mississippi. Reception Critical reaction to The Chamber has been negative. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 12% based on reviews from 25 critics. On Metacritic the film has a score of 45 out of 100 based on reviews from 18 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \\"B+\\" on scale of A to F. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four, remarking: \\"In the early days of X-rated movies, they were always careful to include something of 'redeeming social significance' to justify their erotic content. Watching The Chamber, I was reminded of that time. The attitudes about African Americans and Jews here represent the pornography of hate, and although the movie ends by punishing evil, I got the sinking feeling that, just as with the old sex films, by the time the ending came around, some members of the audience had already gotten what they bought their tickets for.\\" James Berardinelli also gave the film two stars out of four, saying: \\"Plot-wise, The Chamber is full of seeming irrelevancies. The movie should have been streamlined better; there's no need to try to include virtually every character from the book. [...] The Chamber [...] is mechanical and artificial, and tells you what to think.\\" Grisham called the film a \\"disaster\\" and a \\"train wreck from the beginning\\". He added, \\"It could not have been handled worse by those involved, including me. I made a fundamental error when I sold the film rights before I finished writing the book. It was a dreadful movie. Gene Hackman was the only good thing in it.\\" Faye Dunaway's performance in the movie earned her a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Supporting Actress, but she did not win the award.

The Delaware native previously served as the 27th associate justice of the Oregon Supreme Court, including three times as the Chief Justice of that court. After serving as governor he was appointed as an ambassador to Argentina in South America and later helped to codify Oregon's laws. Early life Born to Edward and Elizabeth (Paine) Lord on July 20, 1838 in Dover, Delaware,The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography Lord was partially deaf, and had limited speaking ability. He received his primary education at a Quaker school and through private tutoring. He subsequently studied law at Fairfield College, graduating in 1860. Before he could continue further into his studies, Lord volunteered for military service in the American Civil War, advancing to the rank of Major in the 1st Delaware Cavalry in the Union Army of the Potomac. Once the war ended, Lord continued in law school at Albany College in New York, graduating there in 1866. He then returned to the military for a second time, re-enlisting at the rank of lieutenant. His duties would include postings at Alcatraz in San Francisco and Fort Steilacoom near Tacoma, Washington. When the United States took formal possession of Alaska in 1867, Lt. Lord was sent to Sitka. In 1868, Lord resigned from the army in order to set up a law practice in Salem, Oregon. Entry into politics William Paine Lord soon became involved in politics, as he became Salem's City Attorney in 1870. This launched him into his first elected office: a state Senate seat in 1878. He resigned his Senate seat for a successful run as the Republican nominee for Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court. Lord served on the court from 1880 until 1894. He was a popular justice and had a reputation of being the most competent Jurist in state history, serving out his last term as Chief Justice. He accepted the Republican nomination for the 1894 Governor's Election, stepping down from the court after his gubernatorial election victory. Governorship Governor Lord's popularity swept him into the Governor's Office. He immediately set out to support higher education, eliminate corruption from land speculators, and fueled support for the direct election of United States Senators, when the Senate refused to seat Henry W. Corbett, Lord's appointee. In 1895, the University of Oregon conferred an honorary doctorate of laws degree on the governor.University of Oregon. 1908. General Register of the Officers and Alumni 1873‚Äì1907. Eugene, Or.: The University. p.28. He promoted ending the corrupt land speculation practices of the time by creating the State Land Board, headed by an official State Land Agent. The present land-use system protecting Oregon's wildlife and fisheries would evolve from this early agency. The 1897 House failed to organize, caught up on a dispute over the reelection of U.S. Senator John H. Mitchell. Lord also called for a constitutional amendment to the Oregon Constitution allowing the Governor a line item veto. While nothing came of this during his term of office, later governors would support Lord's proposal. The line item veto was finally approved in 1916. Lord lost his bid for a second term, in the closely fought 1898 primary election campaign against fellow Republican Theodore T. Geer. Later life Shortly after leaving the Governor's Office, Lord was appointed the U.S. Minister (Ambassador) to Argentina by the McKinley Administration. He served in that capacity until 1902, after which he returned to Oregon. In 1902, William Paine Lord was appointed as Code Commissioner by the Supreme Court of Oregon. In this position, which he held until 1910, he examined and annotated all existing Oregon Statute Laws, compiling them into three volumex, Lord's Oregon Lawsofficially the Oregon Statute Code of 1909. In 1910 Lord retired to San Francisco, where he would die on February 17, 1911. His body was returned to Oregon where it is interred in Mount Crest Abbey Mausoleum in Salem.

Synopsis The narrative of the miniseries primarily follows Attila the Hun (reigned 434‚Äì453) during his rise to power, violent unification of the Hunnic tribes, and subsequent campaigns, first against the Eastern Roman Empire, and later against the Visigoths and the Western Roman Empire. A parallel narrative follows Roman general Flavius Aetius, Attila's primary antagonist, who works vigorously to keep the Western Empire intact despite factional politics, a weak emperor, and a steady stream of barbarian invasions.

Historical inaccuracies *Most historians contended that the Huns were of Turco-Mongol descent, as opposed to Caucasian as portrayed here - a small few however have now discounted any connection with the Mongolian Xiongnu and point out that whatever their original point of origin, by Attila's time they had heavily intermarried with western tribes (which had largely been yet to be proven by majority historical accounts). In fact, at least one Hun in the film (Bleda) is made up to look 'mongoloid' - although oddly his uncle (Rua) and brother (Attila) are not. *There is no evidence that Attila ever spent time in Rome, although Aetius was a hostage for a time among the Huns. *The Romans are portrayed in standard Hollywood terms, decadent pagan orgies and all - whereas in reality by this stage they had converted to Christianity. Aetius does, however, at one point in the series, mention that he and Theodoric are both Christians (and in fact mentions that they had fought over religion, suggesting the historical difference between the Arian Visigoths and the Catholic Romans). *The film depicts the Battle of Ch√¢lons as the last major campaign of Attila's career, entirely omitting his campaign the following year in Italy, during which he very nearly sacked Rome but withdrew after meeting with Pope Leo I and Roman officials. *The film depicts Orl√©ans as having fallen to Atilla's advance, when in reality its defenses successfully repelled his assault. *Attila's first wife, N'kara, is entirely fictional as is the daughter of Aetius/Theodoric - although the fact that Attila had adult sons by his death does suggest that he had been married before - perhaps many times. Aetius, however, did have a son named Gaudentius. *The Roman helmets that appear here are the classical Roman helmets, although they had in reality abandoned this armor for the more cost efficient ridge helmet *The Roman uniforms, shields, and weapons resemble that of the early Roman army instead of the late one. *Both Roman and Hun riders use stirrups, and at times horseshoes, which were not introduced into Europe until several centuries later. *Virtually all the swords shown in the film are much too short - in fact virtually every army in the period used some variant of the spatha or longsword as this gave a much longer reach used from horseback. *The siege engines used by the Huns are clearly trebuchets operated by counterweights which did not reach Europe until centuries after Attila - rather they should have been torsion-powered catapults. *The Roman Emperor Valentinian III is depicted as childish, decadent and idiotic, while in truth he probably was a mature but incompetent ruler. *Galla Placidia and Theodosius II were already dead by the time Valentinian murdered Aetius. *There are no records that back up the notion that Theodoric and Aetius shared the same wife. *As with many films portraying the waning days of the Roman Empire, Rome is still the titular capital city. From the time of Diocletian, emperors spent little time in Rome. Milan was the principal seat of emperors in the West‚Äîbetter situated to respond to emergencies‚Äîuntil 404 when the government was relocated to Ravenna. Valentinian III spent long periods of time in Rome and was resident there when he was assassinated. *While Theodoric was killed in the battle, the perpetrator was either an anonymous Hun, or possibly Andag, an ambitious fellow Goth. There are no historians who support a Roman conspiracy theory for his death. *Atilla did not kill Bleda immediately after their uncle's death. In fact they were co-rulers for 11 years, before Bleda died under mysterious circumstances. While it is speculated that Atilla did murder his brother, it was certainly not done in a public challenge. *Aetius was never imprisoned by Galla Placidia for his stance against her and Valentianian III, although he did support Joannes over Galla Placidia's son Valentinian III for ruling of the Western Roman Empire and did fight Galla Placidia's support army from the Eastern Empire of Theodosis II's general Aradaburius. Aetius was able to negotiate a compromise after the fighting did not resolve a victor. Aetius was proclaimed magister millitum of Gaul by Galla Placida.

Background and early career Irving was born in St Pancras, London, the son of Edward Irving, a major figure of the Catholic Apostolic Church, whom Carlyle called the \\"freest, brotherliest, bravest human soul mine ever came in contact with\\", and his wife Isabella Martin. Irving was educated at King's College School, and Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1853 and M.A. in 1856, with first class honours in classics and second class honours in mathematics. At Oxford he was an active rower and won the college and university sculls in 1852.Balliol College Register In the same year, he was runner up in the Silver Goblets paired with Walter Francis Short and losing to Philip Nind and Henry Raine Barker in the final. He was also runner-up in the Diamond Challenge Sculls to Stephen Rippingall in 1853.Henley Royal Regatta Results of Final Races 1839‚Äì1939 Academic career Irving taught classics as second master at the City of London School from 1854 to 1856. He was then was appointed professor of classics and English at the University of Melbourne, where he arrived in July 1856 and held this position for nearly 15 years. Irving took much interest in the development of the young university, but in January 1871 he resigned to become headmaster of Wesley College, Melbourne. He had been offered a salary much larger than he had been receiving as a professor, and this no doubt influenced his decision as he had a growing family. But there was another factor. In the early years of the university students were few, many of them had not been properly prepared for university work, and probably Irving felt he would be doing a real service by helping to raise the standard of secondary school education. At Wesley he was a great success, and by the end of 1874 the number of pupils had risen to 271, a record not exceeded until about 30 years later. He appealed to what was best in the boys' natures, and his relations with his masters were as happy as those with the boys. Samuel Alexander who was a pupil in his period has testified to the excellence and breadth of the education he received at this school. At the end of five years at Wesley, Irving decided that he would prefer the control of a school untrammelled by any committee or council. He bought the Hawthorn Grammar School and made it one of the most successful private schools in Melbourne, with a roll of 200 boys, 50 of whom were boarders. In 1884 Irving handed over the school to his son, Edward H. Irving, and became a member of the public service board of Victoria for a period of 10 years. Irving had retained his interest in the University of Melbourne after giving up his professorship, was a member of the council for some years, and at the election for chancellor in 1886 was defeated by one vote, Sir Anthony Colling Brownless receiving six votes to his five. In 1887 became vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne and held the position until 1889. In earlier years he had been much interested in the volunteer movement and the militia, in which he attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He retired from the public service board in 1894 with a pension, and in 1900 returned to England and devoted himself to the affairs of the Catholic Apostolic Church, of which he had always been an adherent. He received the honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D) from the University of Glasgow in June 1901. Personal Irving, who was well over six feet high, and an excellent oarsman and rifle shot, was the founder of amateur rowing in Victoria. He was a man of fine character with a good sense of business, and was a strong influence in the development of both secondary and university education in Victoria. Irving was twice married. His first marriage in 1855 was to Caroline Mary Bruyeres, daughter of Captain Bruyeres and they had four sons and two daughters. His second wife was Mary Mowat, daughter of John Mowat of Dublin, and they had one son and seven daughters. Two of his daughters carried on the tradition for many years as principals of Lauriston Girls' School, Melbourne. One of his sons, Godfrey George Howy Irving (1867‚Äì11 December 1937), joined the Australian permanent military forces and led the Australian Commonwealth Horse in the South African War. He was chief of the Australian general staff in 1913, and in command of the 14th infantry brigade in Egypt in 1916. After his return to Australia he was promoted major-general and was deputy quartermaster-general until his retirement in 1922. Irving visited Victoria for a few weeks in 1906, and returning to England died at Albury near Guildford in 1912, at the age of 80. References G. C.

He was known mostly for his work in Westerns and for his association with filmmaker Ed Wood. He used the stage names John, Johnny, Josh, and John Forbes.Boyd Magers: Biography of John Carpenter in \\"The Old Corral\\", http://www.b-westerns.com/johnnyc.htm, 2007. Film career Johnny began working in Hollywood in the mid-1940s, mostly in bit parts in B-Westerns. By 1950, Johnny had graduated to larger roles in films produced by Jack Schwarz, including Border Outlaws and Cattle Queen, his breakout film. He starred in several more B-westerns, all the while continuing to do stunt work in higher profile films. From 1953 to 1956, Carpenter produced four movies independently; Son of the Renegade (1953), The Lawless Rider (1954), Outlaw Treasure (1955) and I Killed Wild Bill Hickok (1956). These four films have drawn comparisons between Carpenter and his friend Ed Wood, who actually helped produce The Lawless Rider and may have worked on Son of the Renegade, as well. Carpenter would also make a featured appearance in Wood's 1959 film, Night of the Ghouls. By the 1960s, western film work had dried up and Carpenter's output decreased, with his last film role being in 1961's Tomboy and the Champ. Heaven on Earth Besides his work in westerns, Carpenter had a great love of horses and tried to share his enthusiasm with all who cared. One way in which he spread his love of the outdoors was through his \\"Heaven on Earth\\" ranch.Michael Carpenter: New Heaven on Earth Ranch, http://www.nhoer.org/ , retrieved 28 Jun 2009. First located in Glendale, California (later moved Lake View Terrace), the ranch was available for handicapped children (mostly from Los Angeles) to come and spend a day with the horses and enjoy the mock western town that served as the ranch's backdrop. The ranch began in the mid-1940s and ran until Carpenter was evicted in 1994, having run for around fifty years. References External links  http://www.b-westerns.com/johnnyc.htm.

He played the tenor sax, soprano sax and flute. Biography = Background = Dick Morrissey emerged in the early 1960s in the wake of Tubby Hayes, Britain‚Äôs pre-eminent sax player at the time. Self- taught, he started playing clarinet in his school band, The Delta City Jazzmen, at the age of sixteen with fellow pupils Robin Mayhew (trumpet), Eric Archer (trombone), Steve Pennells (banjo), Glyn Greenfield (drums), and young brother Chris on tea-chest bass. He then joined the Original Climax Jazz Band. Going on to join trumpeter Gus Galbraith's Septet, where alto-sax player Peter King introduced him to Charlie Parker's recordings, he began specialising on tenor saxophone shortly after. Making his name as a hard bop player,The Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD by Richard Cook, Brian Morton Penguin Books, 2002 p1073 , he appeared regularly at the Marquee Club from August 1960, and recorded his first solo album at the age of 21, It‚Äôs Morrissey, Man! (1961) for Fontana, featuring Stan Jones on piano, Colin Barnes on drums, and The Jazz Couriers founding member Malcolm Cecil on bass. He spent most of 1962 in Calcutta, India as part of the Ashley Kozak Quartet, playing three 2-hour sessions seven days a week, before returning to the UK and forming his quartet with Harry South ‚Äì who had also been in the quartet in Calcutta ‚Äì on piano. They were joined by former The Jazz Couriers bassist Phil Bates and variously, another ex-The Jazz Couriers member, Bill Eyden, Jackie Dougan or Phil Seamen on drums. The Dick Morrissey Quartet recorded three LPs, Have You Heard? (1963); the live recording Storm Warning! (1965) on Mercury; and Here and Now and Sounding Good! (1966). The quartet, played regular London gigs at The Bull's Head, Barnes and at Ronnie Scott's, whose manager, Pete King, once said that Ronnie's was kept going in those days due to the crowds Dick Morrissey pulled in. During this time he also played extensively in bands led by Ian Hamer and Harry South, including The Six Sounds, featuring Ken Wray and Dick Morrissey, a band which by 1966 had developed into the Ian Hamer Sextet featuring South, Dick Morrissey, Keith Christie, Kenny Napper and Bill Eyden, among other leading UK-based jazz musicians. He also played briefly in Ted Heath's Big Band, which featured many name jazz musicians over the years, as well as appearing as a featured guest on the classic Johnny Dankworth and his Orchestra recording, What the Dickens! and the Harry South Big Band. Likewise, together with fellow tenors Stan Robinson and Al Gay, baritone sax Paul Carroll, and trumpets Ian Carr, Kenny Wheeler and Greg Brown, Dick Morrissey formed part of (Eric Burdon and) The Animals' Big Band that made its one-and- only public appearance at the 5th Annual British Jazz & Blues Festival in Richmond (1965).The Animals put together a big band to play at the 5th Annual British Jazz & Blues Festival in Richmond. The Animals Big Band made their one public appearance on 5 August 1965. As well as Burdon, Rowberry, Valentine, Chandler, and Steel, they featured a brass/horn section of Ian Carr, Kenny Wheeler and Greg Bown on trumpets, and Stan Robinson, Al Gay, Dick Morrissey and Paul Carroll on saxes. By the mid-1960s, he had over two consecutive years come in second place behind Hayes in the Melody Maker Jazz Poll (1966 & 1967) and many US musicians touring Britain at the time, notably Brother Jack McDuff, a live recording with Jimmy Witherspoon, two LPs with J. J. Jackson, and Sonny Stitt together with guitarist Ernest Ranglin (live at Ronnie Scott's) recorded with him during the Sixties and early Seventies. Dick Morrissey performed regularly at the National Jazz Festival in the 1960s; his last appearance under his own name there was at the 6th festival held at Windsor (1966), although he would return to the festival with If in 1972 for their only appearance. In 1969, Dick Morrissey, by then many-time winner and runner-up of the Melody Maker Jazz Poll, teamed up with another Melody Maker award-winner, guitarist Terry Smith, with whom he had worked in J. J. Jackson‚Äôs Band, to form an early jazz-rock group, If. =Morrissey‚ÄìMullen= When If disbanded in 1975, Dick Morrissey went to Germany on a tour with Alexis Korner and then to the United States to tour and record with the Average White Band, and met up with Glaswegian guitarist, Jim Mullen, who had played with Brian Auger's Oblivion Express with some of the members of AWB, and together they formed Morrissey‚ÄìMullen (aka M&M;), recording their first album, UpGoogle Books Funk: Third Ear ‚Äì the Essential Listening Companion by Dave Thompson Backbeat Books, 2001 , (1976) in New York. On returning to Great Britain, Morrissey‚ÄìMullen formed a band which rapidly became Britain‚Äôs most highly acclaimed jazz-fusion band of the day, initially including two top session musicians from New Zealand, Frank Gibson, Jr. and Bruce Lynch. M&M; recorded seven albums over the 16 years they were together, with Morrissey and Mullen collaborating on each other‚Äôs solo albums, notably After Dark (1983) with John Critchinson, Ron Mathewson, Martin Drew, Barry Whitworth. The line- up for later gigs also featured John Burch on piano, with whom Dick Morrissey would also form an informal group called \\"Our Band\\", also featuring Louis Stewart and/or Jim Mullen on guitar, as well as the above-mentioned Ron Mathewson and Martin Drew. During that period, Dick Morrissey also recorded Souliloquy (1986), featuring Max Middleton, Kuma Harada, Robert Ahwai (all three of whom had also appeared on Morrissey‚ÄìMullen's first UK-recorded album, Cape Wrath, in 1979), Steve Ferrone, Danny Cummings, Bob Weston and Lenny Zakatek. = Other collaborations = As well as leading his own jazz combos, as a \\"musicians' musician,\\" Dick Morrissey was in continuous demand as a guest artist with other British or UK-based jazz musicians, most especially with trios and quartets. Thus he was often to be found jamming with established names such as Tubby Hayes, Bill Le Sage, Roy Budd, Ian Hamer, Ian Carr, Tony Lee, Tony Archer, Michael Garrick (who dedicated him his 1965 composition \\"Leprechaun Leap\\"), Spike Robinson, Allan Ganley, alto saxophonist Peter King, Ray Warleigh, etc. In between regular M&M; gigs, Dick Morrissey would also meet up with old friends Ian \\"Stu\\" Stewart, Charlie Watts, Alexis Korner, Jack Bruce, Colin Hodgkinson, Don Weller, Zoot Money, John Picard and Colin Smith, to play boogie-woogie/jazz/rock with the back-to-the-roots fun band, Rocket 88, that Stewart put together with boogie-woogie pianist Bob Hall. Apart from the early recordings with visiting US performers mentioned above, Dick Morrissey also toured and/or recorded with Charly Antolini, Alexis Korner (several albums), Hoagy Carmichael, participating on Hoagy's last album, In Hoagland (1981) featuring Georgie Fame and Annie Ross, with arrangements by Harry South, Mike Carr, Georgie Fame, Brian Auger, Dusty Springfield, Freddie Mack, Pete York, Paul McCartney, Orange Juice, Gary Numan (he appeared on a number of Numan's albums throughout the 1980s), Phil Carmen, Herbie Mann, Shakatak, Peter Gabriel (the solo in \\"Start\\" and several other tracks from his third album), Jon Anderson (and as a member of the New Life Band's The Song of Seven Tour in 1980), Demis Roussos, Jon & Vangelis and Vangelis, as well as playing the haunting saxophone solo on the Vangelis composition \\"Love Theme\\" for the 1982 film Blade Runner. Other musicians and performers Dick Morrissey shared the stage with include David \\"Fathead\\" Newman, Tommy K√∂rberg, Boz Scaggs, Johnny Griffin, David Sanborn, Steve Gadd, Richard Tee, Billy Cobham, Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, Sonny Fortune, Sonny Sharrock and Teddy Edwards (with whom he jammed a \\"duel\\" at London's 100 Club in the early 1980s), Mel Collins, Dick Heckstall-Smith, John Surman, Graham Bond, Klaus Doldinger, Al Casey, Miller Anderson, Bridget St. John and so on. Whatever the style of music he was playing, be it pop, rock, hard bop or straight ahead jazz, Dick Morrissey showed that music could be appreciated at many different levels, and that even the most simplistic pop or rock song could be embellished with an authentic jazz groove. In this way he was able to reach new audiences and albeit indirectly, introduce people to jazz. When at different stages of his career, journalists asked him to define his style, he would refer to Duke Ellington's definition: \\"It's all music\\" and pointing out that for Ellington there were only two types of music: \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\".Tucker, Mark. Ellington: The Early Years University of Illinois Press, 1995 To that end, his last few recordings concentrated more than ever on jazz standards and the Great American Songbook. = Death = Morrissey died on 8 November 2000, aged 60, after many years fighting various forms of cancer. To the end of his life, he could be seen and heard, seated in his wheelchair, playing to a full house at his local pub, The Alma, in Deal, Kent. His last gig was a reunion with the Morrissey‚ÄìMullen band (including Jim Mullen and Pete Jacobsen) at the Astor theatre in Deal. His funeral, held in Deal, was attended by many of his fellow musicians including Allan Ganley. Following his death, the UK national press published the following obituaries (excerpts): In the obituary published in The Times, British music critic Chris Welch wrote that Dick Morrissey was a > \\"fiery musician who straddled the worlds of jazz and rock, but with a style > built firmly on bebop and widely regarded as the most brilliant British > saxophonist to emerge in the wake of Tubby Hayes. His advocacy of jazz-rock > fusion successfully brought jazz to a rock audience and rock to a jazz > audience\\". Steve Voce wrote in The Independents obituary that Morrissey had the > \\"ability to get through to an audience. He was one of the great > communicators of jazz and ... able to communicate with his listeners and > quickly to establish a bond with them ... [l]ike Charlie Parker before him, > he was somehow able to lift audiences that knew little or nothing about his > music\\". Although one could from time to time imagine a feel of the American > players Sonny Rollins or Johnny Griffin in Morrissey's work, he was > outstanding among British players for his originality. Despite the > sophistication of his ideas there was often a down-home quality to his > punchy and hard swinging solos, and this was a reflection of one of his > idols, the tenorist Stanley Turrentine. He was a lightning improviser and > the flood of his inventions flew through his fingers with ease, for he was a > masterful player.\\" Ronald Atkins, writing in The Guardian, put it thus: > \\"John Coltrane's approach to the tenor had yet to make much of an impact in > Britain, and Morrissey came up with a startling and warmly appreciated blend > of Stan Getz and Sonny Rollins, the phrasing of one allied to the abrasive > tones of the other. He was also influenced by the example of Tubby Hayes, > whose lightening-quick [sic] forays through complex harmonies he was > probably the first to emulate\\". The obituary in The Daily Telegraph read: > \\"Dick Morrissey, who has died aged 60, was among the finest European jazz > musicians of his generation. His command of the tenor saxophone was > masterly, but it was the unforced fluency of his playing, expressed in a > characteristically broad and sweeping tone, that attracted the greatest > admiration. Stylistically, Morrissey was so flexible that he was able to fit > happily into many contexts, from straightforward hard-bop, through jazz-rock > and jazz-funk to soul-inflected pop music. He possessed the remarkable knack > of making everything he played sound not only exciting but happy.\\" Discography =Albums= *It‚Äôs Morrissey, Man!

Career Anderson was playing for Worksop Town when spotted by Wolverhampton Wanderers, moving to Molineux in December 1929. He made his league debut on 11 March 1931 in a 3‚Äì0 win over Port Vale. However, the three games he managed during this season proved his only for the club and he moved to Torquay United in December 1931, where he made his debut on Boxing Day in a 3‚Äì1 defeat away to Queen's Park Rangers. He remained a regular that season, replacing Bob Smith, and was ever- present the following season as Torquay finished in 10th place in Division Three (South), their highest finish so far. In June 1933 he was signed by Second Division West Ham United, making 26 league appearances (2 goals) before moving again, this time to Chester in June 1935. In two years at Chester, he made only 23 league appearances, before leaving for Tranmere Rovers in July 1937. He helped Tranmere to the Third Division (North) title in his first season, making his debut in a 5‚Äì0 home win against Carlisle United on 18 September, and was a member of the team relegated straight back down again the following year, though only playing 7 games in the Second Division. The war interrupted his career, but he appeared more frequently for the Prenton Park side after the league restarted in 1946, going on to make a total of 73 league appearances for Rovers. As the 1947/48 season progressed, it appeared that Anderson had played his final game for Rovers. However, he finally reappeared in the league side on 3 January 1948 playing in a 4‚Äì0 defeat away to one of his previous clubs Chester. His final league appearance came on 27 March that year, playing at right back in a 3‚Äì2 home defeat by Stockport County. During the Second World War, Anderson had guested for New Brighton and Wrexham. After his playing career ended he spent time on the coaching staff at Tranmere and Stockport.

She has toured and recorded with fellow Australian John Farnham; their 1989 duet, \\"Communication\\", peaked at number 13 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Singles Chart. When based in London from 1992 to 1993, she released two solo singles, which have appeared in the UK Singles Chart, and she is the first Australian artist to appear on the UK soul chart. As Sheets Afyre, she was part of singing duo The Nissan Cedrics, with Louise Anton, on ABC-TV comedy show Club Buggery from 1995, which was hosted by Roy and HG. The Nissan Cedrics released Going for a Song in 1997. Her debut solo album, You Don't Know Me, containing jazz covers, was issued in 2002. She is the sister of reality television producer Eden Gaha. In 2007, she married Kyle DeAndrea and they live in Los Angeles. Career Gaha was a backing vocalist for Glenn Shorrock (ex-Little River Band) during his solo tours in the late 1980s and together they released a duet single, \\"One Million Minutes of Peace\\" for the International Year of Peace (1986). She first came to national prominence in August 1989 on a duet with John Farnham called \\"Communication\\", which reached number 13 on the ARIA Singles Chart. She toured with Jason Donovan as a backing vocalist in 1990 and on-stage she sang Kylie Minogue's part in the duet \\"Especially for You\\" with Donovan. In 1991, Gaha released her debut solo single, \\"I Like It\\" which was followed with \\"Secret Love\\" in 1992; neither had chart success in Australia. Later that year, she signed to Epic Records and travelled to the UK. Her first UK single, \\"Stuck in the Middle\\" peaked in the top 75\\\\. The accompanying club remixes were by Roger Sanchez, E-Smoove and Maurice Joshua. Epic released \\"Do It for Love\\" in February 1993, which peaked just outside the UK top 50. Again, the track came with a batch of reputable club remixes from such luminaries as Creative Thieves, Dave Seaman (of Brothers in Rhythm) and Phil Kelsey. In June 1993, Gaha's remixed version of \\"Secret Love\\" was released, and it became a UK club hit and peaked at No. 41. There was an album recorded around this time, featuring the three aforesaid singles, but Epic chose not to release it. Gaha was part of the singing duo The Nissan Cedrics, with Louise Anton (as Muff Merkin) on the ABC-TV comedy show, Club Buggery from 1995, which was hosted by Roy and HG. The Nissan Cedrics released \\"Going for a Song\\" in 1997. In 1988, Danny J Lewis sampled \\"Secret Love\\" on \\"Wanna Spend the Night with You\\", which was a UK top 30 hit. Gaha toured Australia with Farnham in 2002‚Äì2003 on his The Last Time Tour. In 2002, her debut album You Don't Know Me was released. It comprised covers of jazz and blues standards by artists like Ella Fitzgerald and included \\"Moon River\\", \\"A-Tisket, A-Tasket\\" and \\"The Masquerade Is Over\\". You Don't Know Me was well received by critics and sold respectably in Australia but did not chart. In early 2007, Gaha recorded an album with French composer Christophe Jacquelin, who found her on Myspace and flew her over for 2 weeks to record the album Lovers and Tears by Leaving the Ozone‚Äîa project with Gaha, Jacquelin and songwriter Claudia Phillips‚Äîwith a French and Bulgarian orchestra. One of their songs was used for the closing credits on 3D IMAX movie Dolphins and Whales 3D: Tribes of the Ocean (2008). Also in 2007, Gaha married Kyle DeAndrea; they live in Los Angeles, California. She released a CD, Chocolate for Holly, which includes a reworked version of \\"Do It for Love\\". Dannielle DeAndrea won a California State University, Northridge (CSUN) jazz competition in late 2007 and from that recorded her next original EP, Be with Me. In 2008, DeAndrea joined up with Scooter Pietsch and Jessica New to record the dance/pop album Supabeat. Songs from this album have been used on television series including Degrassi High, The Bold and the Beautiful, MTV's Real World, The Greek and Burn Notice. In March 2009, DeAndrea returned to Australia for the launch of Chocolate for Holly and Be with Me at The Vanguard; the performance was sold out. DeAndrea joined Farnham on his Back by Demand Tour in September‚ÄìOctober 2009 throughout Australia. She also performed solo concerts of her own material and jazz standards into November. In 2010, DeAndrea toured Europe and North America as part of Jackson Browne's band. She returned to Australia in October to join Farnham on his national tour. She also performed side shows to promote the release of her new single \\"Blue Skies\\". In 2012, she performed backing vocals for Ariana Grande and combined with Erica Canales (backup singer for Brandon Flowers) and Gaby Moreno to form the vocal group The SongBirds. The SongBirds' 2012 EP was launched at the Sunset Marquis Hotel by Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland and Elle magazine.

It presents plays, operas and musicals featuring established and emerging artists. The theatre building, in the former Colourworks paint factory on Ashwin Street, Dalston, houses two studio theatre spaces, two rehearsal studios and a caf√©-bar. The theatre runs one of East London's most extensive arts engagement programmes, creating over 5000 opportunities for the local community every year. Since 2007 the Green Arcola project has aimed to make Arcola the world's first carbon-neutral theatre.  History  Arcola Theatre was founded by artistic director Mehmet Ergen, in September 2000. Its original location was a former textile factory on Arcola Street in Dalston. The theatre celebrated this with its fifth anniversary production, The Factory Girls by Frank McGuinness. In January 2011 the Arcola moved to a former paint- manufacturing workshop on Ashwin Street in Dalston, after its previous landlord earmarked the Arcola Street site for redevelopment as apartments. It marked the move by premiering The Painter, a play about J. M. W. Turner by Rebecca Lenkiewicz. Since its inception the theatre has twice won the Peter Brook Empty Space Award and was awarded Time Out Live Awards in 2003 and 2006. In 2007, an Arcola co-production of Mojo Mickey by Owen McCafferty became its first West End transfer to the Trafalgar Studios.British Theatre Guide, 30 May 2007 accessed 18 Sep 2007 2007 also marked the first season of the Arcola's Grimeborn, an opera and musical theatre festival that runs for two weeks in August. In September 2014, Nick Connaughton started the Arcola Queer Collective. Some collective members include Rubyyy Jones, Travis Alabanza, Krishna Istha, Damien Killeen, Miss Cairo and Camilla Harding. The theatre is committed to achieving carbon neutral status and a research project, Arcola Energy, \\"bringing together the creative mindset and the engineering methodology\\", is established on the building's top floor to develop and market hydrogen fuel cells, with the profits subsidising the theatre's community arts projects.

It is located north of the town of Nyalam at Gangka village. It is on the slope below the China‚ÄìNepal Friendship Highway and above the Matsang river in Nyalam County, Tibet.Dorje (1999), p. 304. Phelgyeling Monastery Statute of Milarepa from Phelgyeling Monastery A path leads down from the roadside through the village and down a hillside where there is a small monastery (gompa) named Nyanang Pelgye Ling Monastery, or Phelgyeling which is built around the cave.Tibet: Highlights in BriefKarl-Heinz Everding, \\"Tibet: lamaistische Klosterkulturen, nomadische Lebensformen und b√§uerlicher Alltag ...\\", p. 260. The monastery's assembly hall has the statue, in height, of Shakyamuni Buddha in the center. The monastery used to be a Kagyupa but later was converted to a Gelugpa by the 5th Dalai Lama. Later, Phelgyeling Monastery was affiliated with the Gelugpa Sera Monastery in Lhasa.Dorje (1999), p. 304. Description of the cave Milarepa's Cave, which overlooks the entrance to the hidden valley of Lapchi Gang, is entered from the gompa's vestibule. The path is flanked by pilgrim's offerings of decorated stones and sweet-smelling herbs and wild flowers growing all around. The cave itself is kept as a shrine by two monks, guarding a statue of Milarepa enclosed in a glass case. In the cave is an impression in the rock attributed to Milarepa's sitting meditation posture and a hand print said to have been created when Milarepa helped Rechungpa (1083/4‚Äì1161 CE), his student, use a boulder to prop up the ceiling. There are images of Milarepa, Tsongkhapa, and Shri Devi, a protectress whose mule is said to have left a footprint in the stone when she visited Milarepa in a vision.Dorje (1999), p. 304. Restoration work within the cave and the monastery was undertaken by artists and craftsmen from NepalDowman, Keith. 1988. The Power-places of Central Tibet: The Pilgrim's Guide.

In art The cave and the Pelgye Ling temple were the subject of Richard Gere's artistic photo work, Milarepa's Cave, Nyelam Pelgye Ling Temple, Tibet (1993). Associated caves There is also a cave associated with Milarepa in Nepal on the Annapurna Circuit at approximately just outside Manang. It is credited to have been the residence of the famous Saint Milarepa during his stay in modern-day northern Nepal. This site also includes a holy spring, gompa, and bow from the local archer who met and tried to kill Milarepa. In the classical songs of Milarepa, he sings of a deer, a dog and a hunter, the chain of causation and compassion. In local tradition, this is the site of this famous tale. The cave is located beyond the gompa, with locals praying from the edge of a glacial moraine in direct line of sight of the cave as its approach is on a steep scree slope. There are many more caves associated with Milarepa in Nepal. A remarkable one is close to Lar in the Tsum Valley at the border with Tibet, 28.52¬∞N / 85.08¬∞E, alt 3330 m. It features the print in rock of Milarepa's foot. It can be visited and there are two shrines on the site. Buddhist presence in this valley developed around Milarepa's time, as the gompa in Dephu Donma monastery, up the valley, dates back to the 12th century AD.

Katholikentag festivals occur approximately every 2‚Äì4 years in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. Katholikentag in Germany =History= The first official Katholikentag festival was organized by Adam Franz Lennig and held in Mainz from 3 October to 6 October 1848. The idea was a \\"general assembly of Catholic society in Germany\\" (Generalversammlung des katholischen Vereins Deutschlands), originally intended for delegates of the Catholic Church in Germany. The 87 delegates and about 100 visitors met with the aim of improving relations between the Catholic Church in Germany and the German government. During the ensuing decades the Katholikentags increased in popularity and fame. They became an opportunity for Catholics to discuss and celebrate their faith. Since then, the Roman Catholic Church in Germany has become one of a set of state religions. Katholikentag in Germany is now managed by the Central Committee for German Catholics. It continues to be a cultural gathering for Germans of the Catholic faith, and major German politicians and celebrities attend the event. During 1968, members of Katholikentag were among the dissidents and protesters of the encyclical Humanae Vitae. =Katholikentag nowadays= Katholikentag is now a major national event in Germany. Although major Church officials have become involved with the celebration, it has remained a function of the German Catholic laity, and is not an official ecumenical event, nor is it organized or mandated by the clergy. The 100th Katholikentag took place in Leipzig in 2016. Katholikentag in other countries Both Switzerland and Austria have been celebrating Katholikentag for more than 100 years. During recent years the Austrian event has become attended by visitors from other participating countries, namely Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The most recent such Central European Katholikentag occurred during 2004 and featured more than 80,000 visitors, including Pope John Paul II.

It is the first side-story in the Super Robot Wars Alpha series, continuing from Super Robot Wars Alpha. The characters of After War Gundam X, Turn A Gundam, and Combat Mecha Xabungle make debut appearances in the game. Summary Super Robot Wars Alpha Gaiden includes what was the final appearance of the Mas≈ç Kishin \\"Banpresto Originals\\" in the Alpha series, and the last appearance of the characters, besides Masaki Andoh and the Cybuster, Shu Shirakawa and the Granzon, and Lune Zoldark and the Valsione until the Mas≈ç Kishin universe was revisited, first in the OG Saga update of \\"The Lord of Elemental\\" and then in the sequel \\"Revelation of Evil God.\\" Although many fans suspect this is due to a copyright backlash with Winkysoft, it is stated in an interview with the creator of Super Robot Wars he merely wants to give more plot attention towards the other original characters, considering the previous titles have dealt with the Mas≈ç Kishin plots rather extensively. Additionally, the game features the first appearance of Sanger Zonvolt, who later becomes one of the selectable protagonists of the 2nd Super Robot Wars Alpha. Gameplay wise, Alpha Gaiden is the first Super Robot Wars game where all the weapons of a unit are upgraded simultaneously, this would later go on to be used in almost every game made after Alpha Gaiden, save for the Original Generation games. Alpha Gaiden also introduces the Support ability for Attack and Defense, allowing units situated beside one another to attack after each other, or take an oncoming attacking. This ability would also go on to be used in almost every subsequent game. In 2009, Super Robot Wars Alpha Gaiden was also fan translated almost entirely to English. Story Shortly after the events of Alpha, the Earth Federation has covered up many of the events in the climatic battle with the antagonist Aerogaters, but the gravity shock wave from the detonation of the Excelion (from Gunbuster) in the Battle of the Solar System's Absolute Defense is rapidly approaching the Earth, and threatens to wipe out the space colonies and the planet. The Earth's only hope is the Aegis System, which could shield the Earth Sphere from the shock wave. Unfortunately, the heroes are sent to an alternate future, where the Earth has been ravaged by the wave. Faced with a new threat in the form of the Ancestors, the heroes must find a way to return to their time and prevent this alternate, dystopic future from happening.

The Faroe Islands has a small population, and due to the high initial cost of filmmaking, the islands' cinema history is modest. (On the other hand, writing and book publishing is very popular). The first director of the Faroe Islands was Katrin Ottarsd√≥ttir. Her first film set in the Faroe Islands was Atlantic Rhapsody in 1989. However, the first feature films in Faroese language with full Faroese castings (\\"Rannv√†\\" 1975, \\"Heystbl√≥mur\\" 1976 and \\"Pall F√°ngi\\" 1977) were made in the mid-seventies by Miguel Mar√≠n Hidalgo, a Spaniard who stayed for several years in the Faroe Islands. In July 2015, the three films were screened again in the Feroe Islands, at the Nordic House in T√≥rshavn, with the presence of its author Miguel Mar√≠n Hidalgo. The Faroese National TV, Kringvarp F√∏roya, broadcast \\"Rannv√°\\" on 25 and 27 December 2016 and \\"Heystbl√≥mur\\" on 1 and 3 January 2017. Recently self-taught Johan Rimestad directed the self-financed feature Karrybollarnir, which takes place in T√≥rshavn. In 2012 the first Faroese film prize was established, it is called Geytin. The young Faroese director Sakaris St√≥r√° won the first award for his short film Summarn√°tt (Summer night). In 2013 he directed a new short film Vetrarmorgun (Winther morning), which was awarded at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival.

The paper is owned by PT Niskala Media Tenggara and based in the nation's capital, Jakarta. The Jakarta Post started as a collaboration between four Indonesian media at the urging of Information Minister Ali Murtopo and politician Jusuf Wanandi. After the first issue was printed on 25 April 1983, it spent several years with minimal advertisements and increasing circulation. After a change in chief editors in 1991, it began to take a more vocal pro-democracy point of view. The paper was one of the few Indonesian English-language dailies to survive the 1997 Asian financial crisis and currently has a circulation of about 40,000. The Jakarta Post also features an online edition and a weekend magazine supplement called J+. The newspaper is targeted at foreigners and educated Indonesians, although the middle-class Indonesian readership has increased. Noted for being a training ground for local and international reporters, The Jakarta Post has won several awards and been described as being \\"Indonesia's leading English-language daily\\". The Jakarta Post is a member of Asia News Network. History =Founding and development= The former logo of The Jakarta Post. Used until 31 March 2016. The Jakarta Post was the brainchild of Information Minister Ali Murtopo and politician Jusuf Wanandi. Murtopo and Wanandi were disappointed at the perceived bias against Indonesia in foreign news sources. At the time, there were two English-language dailies, The Indonesia Times and The Indonesian Observer. However, due to negative public perception regarding the existing papers, they decided to create a new one. In order to ensure credibility, the two agreed to convince a group of competing newspapers (the Golkar-backed Suara Karya, the Catholic-owned Kompas, the Protestant-owned Sinar Harapan, and the weekly Tempo) to back the nascent paper. It was hoped to become a quality English-language paper, similar to The Straits Times in Singapore, the Bangkok Post in Thailand, and the New Straits Times in Malaysia. After founding PT Bina Media Tenggara to back the paper, Wanandi spent several months contacting influential figures at the targeted newspapers. To receive their cooperation, Kompas requested a 25 percent share in the new newspaper, for which it would handle the daily business operations, such as printing, circulation, and advertising. Tempo offered to assist with management in return for a 15 percent share, while Sabam Siagian of Sinar Harapan was hired as the first chief editor, for which Sinar Harapan received stock. The establishment of the paper was further aided by incoming Information Minister Harmoko, who received 5 percent interest for his role in acquiring a license. In total, the start-up cost Rp. 500 million (US$700,000 at the time). Muhammad Chudori, a co-founder of The Jakarta Post who formerly reported for Antara, became the newspaper's first general manager. Further details, including the matter of Sinar Harapan share of stock and the publisher, were decided at a meeting at Wanandi's office in March 1983. The next month, on 25 April, the first edition ‚Äî totalling eight pages ‚Äî was published. The first newsroom of the new paper were located in Kompas former laundry room, a one-story warehouse; the first employees had to do the layout by hand, using pica poles as straight edges. During the first few months, the writers translated and recycled previously published stories from Indonesian media, which were later picked up by foreign wire services. Original reporting was rare as the editors at first did not want to deal with the censorship of Suharto's New Order government. During the early years of publication, The Jakarta Post had difficulty attracting advertisers, to the point that some editions ran without ads. However, circulation increased dramatically, from 8,657 in 1983 to 17,480 in 1988. Although it was originally hoped that the paper would begin to turn a profit within the first three years, the recession in the early 1980s led to the start-up funds being depleted. Eventually, in 1985 the paper took out an interest-free loan and received Rp. 700 million from its owners. After advertising increased, The Jakarta Post was able to turn a profit by 1988, and was considered \\"one of the most credible newspapers\\" in Indonesia. =Activism= Susanto Pudjomartono, former chief editor of Tempo, became The Jakarta Post second chief editor on 1 August 1991, after Siagian was chosen to be Indonesia's ambassador to Australia. Under Pudjomartono's leadership, the paper began publishing more original work and doing less translation; reporters were also asked to take a more active role in the day-to-day operations of the paper. The paper also became more vocal regarding politics, taking a pro-democracy stance like Tempo. It soon converted its offices into a new, two-story building built using the Kompas pension fund and expanded to 12 pages. In 1994, The Jakarta Post signed a distribution agreement with the British news service Reuters and the American Dialog Information Services, allowing its stories to be more easily promoted overseas. By the mid-1990s, it had established a workshop to assist its new, foreign-born staff in learning the local culture. By December 1998, The Jakarta Post had a circulation of 41,049, and was one of the few English-language dailies in Indonesia after the 1997 Asian financial crisis; six other English-language dailies had failed. That year it also became a founding member of the Asia News Network. Editors-in-chief To date, The Jakarta Post has had seven editors-in-chief: Sabam Pandapotan Siagian (1983-1991), Susanto Pudjomartono (1991-2001), Raymond Toruan (2001-2004), Endy Bayuni (2004-2010), Meidyatama Suryodiningrat (2010-2016), Endy Bayuni (2016-2018), Nezar Patria (2018-2020) and M. Taufiqurrahman (October 2020-present). Editions and other publications =Sunday edition and J+= The Jakarta Post Sunday edition was launched on 18 September 1994. The Sunday edition included more in-depth stories, as well as entertainment and fiction that would not be published in the weekday editions. As part of cost-cutting measures amid declining print advertising revenue, the Sunday edition ceased publication in April 2016. It was replaced by a lifestyle and culture magazine called J+, which is included with the newspaper's Saturday edition. =Online edition= The Jakarta Post features an online edition, which includes both print and internet exclusive stories that are free to access. There are also news flashes that are developed as they happen. The paper hopes to digitise the entirety of its printed stories, with at least 50,000 articles dating to June 1994 already digitised. In 2017, The Jakarta Post began charging subscriptions in order to access \\"premium\\" online content. =Bali Daily= On 9 April 2012 The Jakarta Post launched Bali Daily, a four-page daily newspaper produced in Bali, after noting that 4,900 of the flagship paper's subscribers lived on the resort island. Bali Daily ceased printing in 2014. Market The Jakarta Post is targeted at Indonesian businesspeople, well-educated Indonesians, and foreigners. In 1991, 62 percent of the paper's readers were expatriates. Under Pudjomartono's leadership, it began targeting more Indonesian readers. , approximately half of its 40,000 readers are middle class Indonesians. In 1996, The Jakarta Post faced invigorated competition when media tycoon Peter Gontha bought a controlling stake in rival paper The Indonesian Observer and revamped the publication. However, The Indonesian Observer was unable to match The Jakarta Post's quality of independent reporting because of Gontha's business connections to the Suharto family. He stopped printing The Indonesian Observer in June 2001. In 2008, The Jakarta Post faced new competition, dubbed \\"a wake up call\\", when BeritaSatu Media Holdings, an associated company of billionaire James Riady, began publishing a rival English-language daily newspaper, The Jakarta Globe. The Jakarta Globe even hired several defectors from The Jakarta Post, paying them higher salaries, and the Globe's print run was 40,000. However, by May 2012, The Jakarta Globe converted from broadsheet to tabloid size, and in December 2015 it became an online only publication. When launched in 1983, a single edition of The Jakarta Post cost Rp175. By 2018, the newspaper cost Rp7,500 in Jakarta and Rp9,500 in Bali and Nusa Tenggara. As of 2018, subscriptions cost US$11/month for the online version and US$12/month for the printed version. Layout and style The Jakarta Post follows a broadsheet format. In the beginning, it featured an index on the front page, as well as short offbeat stories under the title \\"This Odd World\\". The lifestyle section had eight comic strips, and it used more photographs and graphics than was normal for Indonesian publications at that time. The editorials tended to be shorter than their Indonesian counterparts. The Jakarta Post uses the inverted pyramid style of reporting, with the most important information at the beginning of the article; during the 1980s, many Indonesian papers put the lede further down. Bill Tarrant attributes this to the different writing styles in English and Indonesian, with English favouring the active voice and direct statements, while respectful Indonesian favours the passive voice and a circuitous approach. Regarding this topic, Wanandi has said that \\"You cannot bullshit in English, like the Javanese way.\\" Public opinion Peter Gelling, of The New York Times, notes that The Jakarta Post has been considered a \\"training ground\\" for local reporters, and offers apprenticeship programs. In 2009, six former The Jakarta Post reporters worked for Bloomberg. In 2014 The Jakarta Post was behind Kompas in terms of online visits. Awards and recognition In 2006, the Reporters Union of Indonesia recognised The Jakarta Post as being one of the Indonesian newspapers that best followed the journalism ethics and standards; other papers so recognised were Kompas and Indo Pos. The paper received the Adam Malik Award in January 2009 for their reporting on foreign politics; the coverage was considered accurate and educated, with good analysis. The following year three reporters received the Adiwarta Award from Sampoerna for excellent photography in the fields of culture, law, and politics. Another journalist received the Adam Malik Award in 2014 for his writings which assisted the ministry to distribute information regarding foreign policy implementation.

It is located at 12 South Street on Monument Square at the edge of Sumner Hill. It is situated on the border of two National Historic Districts (Sumner Hill and Monument Square). This mid-Georgian mansion was built as a country residence and farmstead in 1760 for wealthy British naval officer Commodore Joshua Loring on the original site of John Polley's estate established in the 1650s. Originally, the Loring‚ÄìGreenough house was situated on a estate. Loring, a Loyalist prior to the American Revolution, abandoned the house in 1774, just prior to the conflict, and he fled from Boston in 1776. The house was confiscated by colonial forces and in 1776 served as a headquarters for General Nathanael Greene and, soon after, a hospital for Continental Army soldiers following the Battle of Bunker Hill. In 1780, the house was sold to Isaac Sears, the rebel leader from New York, and was then purchased in 1784 by Ann Doane, a rich widow, who soon after married David Stoddard Greenough. General William Hyslop Sumner married the widow of David Stoddard Greenough II (Maria Doane Greenough) in 1836 and by the late 1850s the process to subdivide the estate and farmland had begun. The Greenough descendants lived here for five generations until 1924. At that time the Jamaica Plain Tuesday Club (until 1993 a ladies'-only club and today a community group) purchased the house, along with almost two acres of landscaped grounds, to preserve it and save it from development. The Loring‚ÄìGreenough House is a very well preserved structure of almost , on property that includes sweeping lawns, historic flower beds, handsome trees, and the two-and-one-half-story house itself. The property is fenced and gated; the public is invited to enjoy the grounds during daylight hours, and to attend events inside and outside the House throughout the year. The Tuesday Club has been careful to preserve the house and grounds over many decades. The most recent restoration occurred with a $350,000 grant and included painting and other repairs. The Loring‚ÄìGreenough property is still owned and operated by the Tuesday Club, which offers tours on Sundays and other programming and events throughout the year. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was designated both a Massachusetts Landmark and a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1999.

Axel was the one member of the cast that was sensible and orderly. He loved to rest and vedge, but most of his time was spent settling the arguments between Scoop, Doozie, and Spritz. Axel rarely got into trouble. *Spritz----a silver and black troublemaking, argument starting, provoking garden hose. Spritz is considered somewhat of a villainous character, as she was pessimistic and enjoyed causing arguments. Scoop and Doozie was produced by Queen Bee Productions. Romney Grant was executive producer. Vicki Grant was creative producer and story editor. Edward Peghin was the producer. Program Format The show started out with the three machines, Axel, Scoop, and Doozie, doing something together when they encountered a problem. Upon this problem, they sometimes would go the basement window of the house of the yard where the machines lived, and watch the owner of the house doing something to solve a similar problem. Other times the machines would go over to the fence posts to watch Fence TV (a video of real machines screened through a knothole). When the basement/Fence TV segment was done, the machines use what they had seen and heard to apply to the problem they had encountered. Trivia *During the run of the show, Scoop had three different designs. Romney Grant and Vicki Grant are sisters. Romney is a lawyer who produced the cooking show \\"The Urban Peasant\\". Vicki is a television writer and novelist. Christine Lippa who played Scoop, Spritz and Mrs. Glover is an actor and stand-up comedian. This was her first job as a puppeteer. Norman Foote who played Axel and Long John wrote the music for the series. He is a popular children's entertainer. Jim Rankin who played Doozie, Jacques and Cal also starred in The Comedy Network adult series, \\"Puppets Who Kill\\". He is currently developing his own preschool puppet show, \\"Go to Bed, Jimmy\\". Jim won a Gemini for his work on Scoop and Doozie. Vicki Grant, who wrote most of the episodes, now writes Young Adult novels. Her first book, \\"The Puppet Wrangler\\", was inspired by Scoop and Doozie. She has also written two comic legal thrillers for teens, \\"Quid pro Quo\\" and \\"Res Judicata\\", as well as four shorter novels - \\"Dead-End Job\\", \\"Pigboy\\", \\"I.D.\\" and \\"Nine Doors\\". Scoop and Doozie won a Gemini for Best Writing in a Children or Youth Program for the episode \\"What Rubbish!\\" (by Vicki Grant) and a Bronze at the Columbus International Film and Video Festival for the episode \\"Some Bunny Like Me\\" (by Vicki Grant). It was also nominated for a Gemini for Best Children's or Youth Program and Best Writing in a Children's or Youth Program for the episode \\"Au Revoir, Underpants!\\" (by Vicki Grant).

History The park was formerly part of the Manor of Rothamsted, later Rothamsted estate, owned by Sir John Lawes. He initiated agricultural experiments in 1843, which led to the founding of the nearby Rothamsted Experimental Station. He also created the formal entrance from Leyton Road to what is now the Park and planted the avenue of Lime trees. In 1931, the family decided to sell the estate, and after a successful public appeal, the Experimental Station was able to finance its purchase of the estate in 1934. In 1938 the Harpenden Urban District Council purchased the land now known as Rothamsted park from the Experimental Station, in order to provide playing fields and to preserve an important open space. Rothamsted Park is also home to Harpenden Town FC. The Park's main entrance gates were removed for salvage during the Second World War, and after the war the restoration of the entrance was paid for by the Friends Provident Insurance Company.

The original Faroese title is Atlantic Rhapsody - 52 myndir √∫r T√≥rshavn, where the second part means \\"52 pictures from T√≥rshavn\\". The film presents a day in the life of some inhabitants of T√≥rshavn, the capital of the Faroe Islands. The narrative is structured as a relay race, in which a person, a thing or something out of a scene brings the audience into another scene with new people and events. It is the first ever Faroese feature-length film. Synopsis A trip through 24 hours of the smallest capital in the world, T√≥rshavn, the film begins with a father and a daughter who are having breakfast when some fire trucks drive by. A woman and her child are looking at the fire and meet a married couple. The couple say hello to a man who is going out with his boat etc. Out of this emerges a kaleidoscopic story of both daily occurrences and dramatic situations, which in an entertaining and ironic way acts as a commentary on the Faroese, foreigners in the islands, as well as Faroese society in general. Production Atlantic Rhapsody is the first feature film ever to be produced in the Faroes. It is a no-budget film made against all odds for 1.7 million DKR.

He was raised in Fort Smith, Arkansas. His name has been legally changed to Marty Stouffer. Along with his brother Mark, he also produced the TV series of John Denver specials for ABC in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Another half-dozen one-hour Specials for the National Geographic Society were also produced during that same time period. Stouffer's special \\"The Predators\\" was narrated by Robert Redford and his special \\"The Man Who Loved Bears\\" was narrated by Will Geer and Henry Fonda.  Early influences  At age 19 Stouffer traveled to Alaska on his own with a Super 8 mm movie camera. He returned home to a warm reception by an audience of 1,800 local Arkansas residents in the Fort Smith Municipal Auditorium who turned out to view what was basically a home movie. To that audience he first aired an unsophisticated movie of his adventure in the North, paid for his summer vacation many times over, and easily made an early decision to spend his life creating many more such productions. Soon after that success and his decision to pursue a career in wildlife documentary-making, he graduated from college and began his career in earnest. In 1970, Stouffer graduated from the University of Arkansas with a degree in English. From there he traveled to Botswana to spend most of a year filming a feature-length documentary entitled Botswana, Where a River Dies. While in Africa, he was confronted with the often cruel and wasteful killing of animals, political unrest and human tragedies. As a result, he returned to America with the intention of producing films promoting nature conservation. One of these efforts was The American Wildlife Project.  Marty Stouffer's Wild America  By the mid-1970s, Stouffer had compiled several full-length specials that aired on television as prime time network documentaries. At that time, he approached the programming managers at PBS about a half-hour-long wildlife series. PBS signed for the rights to broadcast Stouffer's series Wild America in 1981. The series almost immediately became one of the most popular aired by PBS, renowned for its unflinching portrayal of nature, as well as its extensive use of unique film techniques such as extreme slow motion, close-ups and time-lapses through the seasons of the year. Stouffer's stories, incorporating dramatic \\"facts of life,\\" and told simply in his home-spun style, won the hearts of a loyal audience. It was one of PBS's most highly rated regular series, never leaving the Top Ten, and in more than one year, it was the Number One highest rated regular series to air on the network. It remains the most-broadcast Series which has ever aired on Public Television. At the time, it was common for producers to limit the number of broadcasts to 4 airings over a period of 3 years. Stouffer saw no good reason for that limitation and he was the first producer to offer unlimited broadcasts of the series by the network. Many of the 260 PBS stations chose to broadcast the programs multiple times each day throughout the weeks. In some weeks, according to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed by more than 450 million viewers. It has amassed sales of videos, both VHS and DVD, totaling more than $60 million. In March 2015, Stouffer attempted to finance a 4K resolution remastering of Wild America via a Kickstarter campaign. The Kickstarter ended in failure March 18, 2015, having raised only $3,410 of the target $1,250,000 (0.27%) and amassing just 39 backers. = The movie = The lives of Marty Stouffer and his brothers Mark and Marshall, in the town of Fort Smith, Arkansas, were adapted for the 1997 movie Wild America. Headlined by child actor Jonathan Taylor Thomas, the movie dramatized how the boys became intrigued with the production of wildlife documentaries. Both Mark and Marshall are filmmakers as well.  Controversy and ethics  In 1993, Stouffer was fined $3,000 in a Federal court in Grand Junction, Colorado for building a camp on public land. In 1995 or early 1996, Stouffer was fined $362,000 by a jury in a civil lawsuit for illegally cutting a six-mile trail through property owned by the Aspen Center for Environmental Studies in Colorado to access Stouffer's camp on Forest Service land; Stouffer was attempting to gain better access to an elk migration path by building the trail.Williams, Ted. \\"Phony wildlife photography gives a warped view of wildlife.\\" Audubon.

The suit alleges that that several shows on the National Geographic Channel and Nat Geo Wild have used titles, episode structures and filming styles that directly emulate those of \\"Wild America\\".

The province consists of eight Internal Provinces (each led by an archbishop) and 61 dioceses (each headed by a bishop). The current archbishop and primate is the Most Rev. Justin Badi Arama. It received the current naming after the inception of the Province of the Episcopal Church of Sudan, on 30 July 2017. Archbishop Primate The episcopal see of the Archbishop of South Sudan is at Juba. The incumbent serves the whole church as its Primate, but is Metropolitan archbishop only for his own diocese (Juba), as the diocese of Juba stands alone as extra-provincial. He is titled \\"Archbishop & Primate of South Sudan, and Bishop of Juba\\". He represents the province to the rest of the Anglican Communion, and serves on the international Primates' Meeting. In January 2018, the Episcopal Church of South Sudan elected Bishop Justin Badi Arama of the Diocese of Maridi to serve as its archbishop, succeeding Archbishop Daniel Deng Bul, who retired after serving ten years in the office. All other dioceses (apart from Juba) are part of one of the eight internal provinces, each headed by an Archbishop. There have been five primate archbishops since the province was created in 1976. ;Archbishops of Sudan and South Sudan (united as a single province) # Elinana J.

The mission led to widespread conversion to Christianity throughout southern Sudan. Missionary activity came first under the Diocese in Jerusalem, and then, in 1920, as part of the new Diocese of Egypt and the Sudan, with Llewellyn Henry Gwynne as its first bishop. As the pace of growth continued, a separate Diocese of the Sudan was formed with its own bishop in 1945. In 1957, oversight for the Diocese of the Sudan was transferred from the Archbishop of Canterbury to the Archbishop in Jerusalem. In 1974, when the Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East underwent structural reform, Sudan became an independent province of four dioceses. Due to continued growth and displacement due to the Second Sudanese Civil War, the province had 11 dioceses by 1993 and has subsequently continued to grow. Many of the dioceses are small. The Episcopal Church of Sudan played a prominent role in the peace process in Sudan. At the secession of South Sudan, in 2011, the combined province had 5 large dioceses covering Sudan (Khartoum, Port Sudan, El Obeid, Wad Medani and Kdugli), and 26 dioceses in South Sudan. With an estimated number of four and a half million members, with three and a half million of these in the south, the Episcopal Church of the Sudan accounted for almost half of South Sudan's population. The Episcopal Church of Sudan renamed itself as the Province of the Episcopal Church of South Sudan and Sudan at the meeting that took place in Bor, South Sudan, from 27 to 30 November 2013. It was decided at the same meeting to divide the Church into nine internal provinces ‚Äì one in Sudan, and eight in South Sudan. One of these internal provinces would be the Central Equatorial Internal Province, whose first archbishop was Paul Pitya Benjamin Yugusuk, son of the late Primate Benjamin Wani Yugusuk, enthroned in Juba on 23 July 2017.A joyous day in Juba as the first internal provincial Archbishop is enthroned, Anglican Communion News Service, 26 July 2017 Creation of the new province At the November 2013 Synod it was resolved to create an internal (or metropolitical) Province comprising the dioceses of Sudan, and other internal provinces in South Sudan, but to maintain the overall unity of the church across Sudan and South Sudan. The Internal Province of the Episcopal Church of Sudan was created, comprising the 5 dioceses situated in Northern Sudan, of which Ezekiel Kondo, the Bishop of Khartoum, was elected the first archbishop on 4 April 2014. Many in Sudan maintained a longer term view of separating this internal province from South Sudan to full autonomy, with the expectation that the metropolitan archbishop would ultimately become archbishop primate of the new autonomous church. In 2016 a formal application was made to the Anglican Consultative Council (ACC) for the internal province of Sudan to be granted autonomy, and in July 2016 a team led by the archbishop of Adelaide and the vice chairman of the ACC carried out a fact-finding mission in northern Sudan. This team reported back to the ACC to enable a formal response to the application for autonomy.Report on visiting team at ACNS. In March 2017 it was announced that the ACC had decided that the internal province of Sudan would become the 39th province of the Anglican Communion, with Ezekiel Kondo, Archbishop of Khartoum, as the first archbishop and primate. The constitution of the new province took place on 30 July 2017, in the presence of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Since that date, the larger part of the original province has been styled the Province of the Episcopal Church of South Sudan. Membership There are approximately 3,500,000 Anglicans in South Sudan. There are around a further 1,000,000 in The Republic of Sudan, which has been a separate Anglican province since 2017. In September 2018 the province lost one of its younger bishops in an aeroplane crash. The Bishop of Yirol, the Rt Revd Simon Adut Yuang, was killed when the aircraft crashed into a lake near Yirol Airport. There were 23 people on board the aeroplane, of whom 20 were killed, including the bishop.

This made the Episcopal Church of South Sudan the first GAFCON-aligned province of the Anglican Communion to have consecrated a woman as a bishop. The consecration remains controversial, being contrary to GAFCON policy which does not permit women to be ordained as bishops. Anglican realignment The Episcopal Church of South Sudan is a member of the Global Anglican Future Conference and the Global South, and as such has been involved in the Anglican realignment. The House of Bishops of the Episcopal Church of Sudan decided to break communion with the Episcopal Church from the United States, because of their acceptance of non-celibate homosexuality, at their General Synod, held in 14‚Äì16 November 2011, declaring itself at the same time in full communion with the Anglican Church in North America.Sudan breaks with the Episcopal Church, Anglican Mainstream, 27 December 2011 It was decided still to \\"work with those parishes and dioceses in TEC who are Evangelical orthodox churches and faithful to God\\". Archbishop Robert Duncan of the ACNA spent the three days of Easter, at 19‚Äì21 March 2013, in the province, at invitation of Archbishop Daniel Deng of the Episcopal Church of Sudan. Ezekiel Kondo, of the Internal Province of Sudan, was one of the eight Anglican archbishops that attended Foley Beach enthronement, which took place on 9 October 2014, at the Church of the Apostles, in Atlanta, United States. The House of Bishops decided to formally recognize and to forge a closer relationship with ACNA, following their meeting, held in 25‚Äì28 November 2015. At the same time, it was decided to end any formal ties with the Episcopal Church, due to their resolutions that redefined marriage and are not in conformity with the Scriptures, in their view. The House of Bishops also recommended that their Provincial Synod severed any relationship with other province or diocese that approves the blessing of same-sex unions, like the Anglican Church of Canada and the Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil. They also encouraged all the South Sudanese and Sudanese \\"diaspora congregations\\" in the United States to join, wherever possible, ACNA.Anglican Church of South Sudan and the Sudan Recognizes the Anglican Church in North America, ACNA Official Website The province was represented at GAFCON III, that took place in Jerusalem, on 17‚Äì22 June 2018, by a 26 members delegation.

Location The broch is located near Golspie in Sutherland. It stands beside the A9 road, around 4 kilometres northeast of Golspie. The site is under the care of Historic Scotland and has a car-park and information board for visitors. Description The broch has an external diameter of around 19 metres and an internal diameter of around 10 metres. The broch wall is particularly thick. The entrance passage is on the east side and is over 4 metres long. The entrance has elaborate door checks and a bar-hole to control access to the interior. On the right-hand side of the entrance passage is a small guard cell. The surrounding enclosure contains the ruins of additional stone buildings. Excavations The broch was first excavated in the 19th century by the Duke of Sutherland, and was initially thought to be a burial cairn. Finds included pottery, flint chips, stone hammers, mortars and pestles, querns, whorls, shale rings, long-handled bone combs, a whale bone club, a silver fibula, steatite cups and an iron blade. In 1909 the entrance passage was still visible on the east side of the broch, but by 1960 no structural features were discernible. The site was excavated again in 1986. This showed that the site was occupied in the Bronze Age, before the broch was built. A Bronze Age cist burial with a food vessel was discovered. The foundations of many outbuildings were found in the enclosure surrounding the broch. Although many were clearly from a later period, some may have been contemporary with the broch.

The genus is characterised by an ability to colonise relatively small and isolated islands and thereafter to evolve flightless forms, many of which became extinct following Polynesian settlement. Description Many of the rails, including the well-known weka of New Zealand, are flightless or nearly so. Many of the resultant flightless island endemics became extinct after the arrival of humans, which hunted these birds for food, introduced novel predators like rats, dogs or pigs, and upset the local ecosystems. A common Polynesian name of these rails, mainly relatives of G. philippensis, is veka/weka (in English, this name is generally limited to Gallirallus australis). On the other hand, Gallirallus species are (with the exception of the weka) notoriously retiring and shy birds with often drab coloration. Living species In the online list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC), the genus contains two species: *Weka, Gallirallus australis *Calayan rail, Gallirallus calayanensis These species are placed by BirdLife International and IUCN in the separate genus Hypotaenidia but are still considered part of Gallirallus by The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World/eBird: *Okinawa rail, Gallirallus okinawae *Barred rail, Gallirallus torquatus *Pink-legged rail, Gallirallus insignis *Roviana rail, Gallirallus rovianae *Guam rail, Gallirallus owstoni - extinct in the wild (late 1980s) *Lord Howe woodhen, Gallirallus sylvestris *Buff-banded rail, Gallirallus philippensis *Dieffenbach's rail, Gallirallus dieffenbachii - extinct (mid-19th century) *Wake Island rail, Gallirallus wakensis - extinct (1945) *Tahiti rail, Gallirallus pacificus - extinct (late 18th - 19th century) Species extinct before A.D. 1500 Illustration of an unidentified extinct species (possibly G. vekamatolu) from Vava'u, 1739 * Nuku Hiva rail, Gallirallus epulare * New Ireland rail, Gallirallus ernstmayri * Ua Huka rail, Gallirallus gracilitibia(subscription required) * Niue rail, Gallirallus huiatua (subscription required) * Tinian rail, Gallirallus pendiculentus * Aguiguan rail, Gallirallus pisonii * Mangaia rail, Gallirallus ripleyi * Tahuata rail, Gallirallus roletti * Tubuai rail, Gallirallus steadmani(subscription required) * Huahine rail, Gallirallus storrsolsoni * Rota rail, Gallirallus temptatus * ‚ÄòEua rail, Gallirallus vekamatolu - possibly survived to the early 19th centuryA similar bird was found to live on nearby Vava‚Äòu in 1793.

Located in the lower peninsula at the mouth of the Muskegon River, Muskegon Lake forms a broad harbor along the eastern shoreline of Lake Michigan, approximately wide by long. Hydrology The Muskegon River, Michigan's second-longest river, originating at Houghton Lake and flowing southwest for , empties into Muskegon Lake at the eastern end before entering Lake Michigan. On the north, Bear Creek/Lake empties into the lake via the Bear Lake Channel and on the south, Ryerson Creek and Ruddiman Creek flow into Muskegon Lake. History Muskegon Lake played an important role in the early development of the city of Muskegon, as well as the logging industry in Michigan. Timber, particularly white pine, was harvested throughout central Michigan and floated downstream on the Muskegon River to the lake, which at one time boasted more than 47 sawmills along its banks. Cities and parks Muskegon Lake Cities located on Muskegon Lake include Muskegon, Michigan and North Muskegon, Michigan. Major parks located along Muskegon Lake include Muskegon State Park on the north at Lake Michigan, Heritage Landing in downtown Muskegon, and Pere Marquette Park on the south at Lake Michigan. Transportation Docks for the Lake Express Cross-Lake Ferry which provides ferry service across Lake Michigan between Muskegon, Michigan to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, are located on the southern shore of Muskegon Lake. Muskegon Lake sightseeing trips are also available aboard the AquaStar (formerly the Port City Princess).

Although predominantly a music magazine, AU covered other aspects of popular culture, such as movies, comics, games and the arts. The magazine was launched in June 2003. 81 issues were published in total, with the final issue being published in March 2012. History Alternative Ulster (named after a song by Stiff Little Fingers) started life in March 2002 as a radio show on Belfast community station Northern Visions, as well as a website. Early the following year, a prototype 'Issue Zero' was launched, promising to provide \\"the best reportage from the local world and beyond.\\"Alternative Ulster Issue Zero, March 2003 Local band Therapy?, headlined the official launch party in the Mandela Hall on 6 June 2003. In 2004, the magazine won Magazine of the Year.\\"MAG-NIFICENT\\" retrieved 19 June 2007 The magazine underwent a massive redesign and relaunch in February 2007, when the name officially changed from Alternative Ulster to AU. Though it continued to cover Northern Irish music, the name change reflected the magazine's wider scope of alternative music from around the world. For Issue 63 AU made the switch from a paid-for title to a free publication. The aim was to increase advertising sales by increasing circulation, and that this would offset the loss of sales. The strategy proved successful and AU remained a free publication until it ceased in 2012. AU went under its final and most extensive redesign for Issue 71. The spine was replace with a saddle stitch, the heavyweight cover was dropped, and the paper was changed from a silk to an uncoated stock. The whole internal design was overhauled, with each section and style being tweaked and improved. Content The overall remit of AU was to place the best of Northern Irish and Irish music, culture and lifestyle alongside big international names and content. The ethos was that there was regional talent on a par with that from the rest of the globe, and so it should be treated in the same fashion. From the very first issue regional bands were covered in every way possible, including large features, record reviews, live reviews, news, short pieces and more. There were also many photo shoots conducted with regional acts, and the photography and design was a key component of the magazine. A number of Northern Irish acts appeared as cover stars of the magazine, including Two Door Cinema Club, Snow Patrol, Therapy?, Ash, Duke Special, The Answer, Panama Kings, And So I Watch You From Afar and David Holmes. While the focus of the magazine was on music, other cultural content was extensively covered, including film, books, arts and more. AU Army The 'AU Army' was the magazine's street team. It was created in January 2007 and was largely made up of students who did work experience in the AU offices. Its members distributed stickers and back issues into waiting rooms and ran stalls at gigs in towns and cities around Ireland. Logo The first AU logo featured the full words of Alternative Ulster and dominated the masthead. In 2006, the full name was phased out and re-branded as simply AU. The logo featured the letters AU in white writing within a red circle and white border. Initially, the words Alternative Ulster appeared under the circle, but this was later removed and the circle remained. Instead of dominating the cover, the logo was moved to the top left and the featured artists became the focal point of the issue cover page. The magazine also launched a sticker campaign, where their street team, the AU Army travelled around the country, branding all types of items with the AU logo. Staff The magazine employed a large team of writers, photographers and designers from around Ireland and further afield. It also occasionally featured writing by musicians and others, for example Jetplane Landing frontman Andrew Ferris and BBC Radio presenter Rigsy. *Publisher & Editor in Chief ‚Äì Jonny Tiernan *Editor ‚Äì Chris Jones *Editor ‚Äì Francis Jones *Editor ‚Äì David McLaughlin *Editor - Phil Crossey *Photo Editor - Iona Bateman *Sub-editor ‚Äì Chris Jones *Contributing Editor ‚Äì Ross Thompson *Senior Contributor ‚Äì Edwin McFee *Design & Illustration ‚Äì Stuart Bell, Luke Carson, Tim Farrell, Neil Gillespie, Elissa Tiernan *Photography ‚Äì Iona Bateman, Alan Maguire, Gavin Millar, Loreana Rushe, Graham Smith *Advertising Manager ‚Äì Elissa Tiernan *Promotions and Marketing Assistant ‚Äì Kim Barclay References External links *Alternative Ulster Archive (ongoing) *AU Issuu Page * https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/alternative-ulster-fanzine-1977 2003 establishments in Northern Ireland 2012 disestablishments in Northern Ireland Monthly magazines published in the United Kingdom Music magazines published in the United Kingdom Defunct magazines published in the United Kingdom Magazines established in 2003 Magazines disestablished in 2012 Magazines published in Northern Ireland Mass media in Belfast ","title":"Alternative Ulster"},{"id":"5717521","text":"Hart Benton Holton (October 13, 1835 ‚Äì January 4, 1907) was an American politician.

As of March 2019, the Canada National Parks Act extended federal protection to 47 national parks and park reserves across the country covering more the 300,000 km2 of habitat. The current Canada National Parks Act received royal assent on October 20, 2000 and has been amended since. The first national parks act in Canada was created in 1887 shortly following the creation of the world's first national park, Yellowstone National Park, in the United States. In 1911, under a renewed national parks act, Canada became the first country in the world to establish their own national parks service. Over the course of its history, the predecessor National Parks Act struggled to define the primary intention of national parks by trying to balance parks as places both of conservation and public leisure. Remarks made by the Canadian Minister of Environment and Climate Change in 2018 signalled a renewed commitment by the Parks Canada agency to ecological conservation within national parks. Early legislation in Canada applied exclusionary policies and forcibly removed Indigenous peoples off lands in order to create national parks.Cardinal, Nathan. ‚ÄúThe Question of Aboriginal Harvesting in Canada‚Äôs National Parks,‚Äù September 2008, 3. With developments in the legal recognition of Aboriginal title and rights in Canada, provisions have been included within the National Parks Act to extend the right of traditional harvesting activities within national park reserves with some cases altering park management to be shared between the Parks Canada agency and local Indigenous groups.  History of the Canada National Parks Act  = 1887‚Äîthe Rocky Mountains Park Act = Banff National Park Pavilion, circa 1920 Greatly inspired by the creation of Yellowstone National Park in the United States in 1872, the Rocky Mountains Park Act established the first distinctive national parks legislation in Canada and provided for the creation of the country's first national park, Rocky Mountain Park (now Banff National Park). Lobbied heavily for by the Canadian Pacific Railway, the Act outlined the national parks model which balanced conservation as well as development.Binnema, T., and M. Niemi. ‚Äú‚ÄòLet the Line Be Drawn Now‚Äô: Wilderness, Conservation, and the Exclusion of Aboriginal People from Banff National Park in Canada.‚Äù Environmental History 11, no. 4 (October 1, 2006): 724‚Äì50. https://doi.org/10.1093/envhis/11.4.724. The Act established the management of the park and its resources to be under the authority of the Minister of the Interior and the Governor in Council. The Rocky Mountains Park Act also prohibited the settlement or occupation of any of the park‚Äôs area, giving the Minister of the Interior and Governor in Council the right to remove trespassers. = 1911‚Äîthe Dominion Forest Reserves and Parks Act = Passed by the government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the Dominion Forest Reserves and Parks Act received royal assent on May 19, 1911. One of the most significant results of the Act was that it created the Dominion Parks Branch as a new branch of the Department of the Interior to oversee the administration of federal parks. Incidentally the Dominion Parks Branch was the first national parks service in the world to be established and James Bernard Harkin was made its first commissioner. Inspired by American environmentalist, John Muir, Harkin oversaw the number of parks in Canada triple (from 6‚Äì18). = 1930‚Äîthe National Parks Act = Arising from years of dissatisfaction from Commissioner Harkin and his administration, the National Parks Act, which was implemented in 1930, replaced the administration of the national parks from the Dominion Forest Reserves and Parks Act. Unlike in earlier legislation, the general purpose section (section 4) of the National Parks Act (1930) stated that national parks are spaces of nature to ‚Äúbe maintained and made use of so as to leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.‚Äù Such phrasing in the Act has led to it being recognized as the foundation upon which subsequent ecological protection within national parks has been based. However, economic development remained a prominent role of parks. = 2000‚Äîthe Canada National Parks Act = The Canada National Parks Act, which received royal assent in 2000, applies the strongest conservation language to date making the maintenance and restoration of ecological integrity within national parks its number one priority. Section 32 of the Act, Mitigation of Environmental Damage, implements the legal requirement of anyone who is responsible for environmental damage within a park to take measures to prevent environmental degradation and danger to flora and fauna. If the responsible person does not comply, they are liable for the expenses of those measures which would be performed by the federal government. Despite this commitment to ecological protection, the Canada National Parks Act continues to apply the historic dualism between development and conservation by dedicating the national parks to \\"the people of Canada for their benefit, education and enjoyment\\" (2000, c.32, s.4).  Park lands  = National parks = Banff Park‚ÄîCanada's first National Park The Act enables Parks Canada to designate and maintain national parks and national park reserves. Within these, additional wilderness areas may be designated. Natural resources in protected areas are dedicated to the \\"benefit, education and enjoyment\\" of the people of Canada. Development in the national parks has to be authorized by Parks Canada, subject to the provisions of this Act. = National Park Reserves = National park reserves are defined as protected areas that have not yet been brought under federal jurisdiction due to outstanding matters (such as aboriginal rights). The Canada National Parks Act applies to park reserves as if they were parks apart from sections 40 to 41.4 which stipulate the right of Aboriginal people to practice traditional renewable resource harvesting activities within the park reserve boundaries. Nahanni National Park Reserve was one of the first established park reserves in Canada. In 1972, Kluane National Park Reserve and Nahanni National Park Reserve became the first areas to be established as park reserves. The park reserves share management of the land between Parks Canada and local First Nations.Parks Canada, Canadian Heritage Rivers System, and Unesco.

Any activity that may impair the wilderness character of these areas is restricted, with the possible exception of activities regarding public safety, basic visitor facilities and park administration.  Indigenous peoples and park lands  = Exclusionary policies = Many of Canada's national parks were established on the traditional lands of Indigenous peoples and it has been argued that early national parks were used as tools of colonialism. Although today Parks Canada promotes itself as working closely with a number of Indigenous groups as partners in the management of many national park reserves, past national parks acts explicitly excluded Indigenous peoples from parklands.Langdon, Steve, Rob Prosper, and Nathalie Gagnon. ‚ÄúTwo Paths One Direction: Parks Canada and Aboriginal Peoples Working Together.‚Äù The George Wright Forum 27, no. 2 (2010): 12. In some cases, Indigenous people were forcibly removed from areas that would become national parks, while in others, Indigenous people were encouraged to sell or trade their reserves for lands outsides of the park. The creation of Canada‚Äôs first national park, Banff National Park (then Rocky Mountains National Park), barred the Stoney Nakoda First Nation from the parklands where they had previously hunted and travelled.Binnema, T., and M. Niemi. ‚Äú‚ÄòLet the Line Be Drawn Now‚Äô: Wilderness, Conservation, and the Exclusion of Aboriginal People from Banff National Park in Canada.‚Äù Environmental History 11, no. 4 (October 1, 2006): 724‚Äì50. https://doi.org/10.1093/envhis/11.4.724.Youdelis, Megan. ‚Äú‚ÄòThey Could Take You out for Coffee and Call It Consultation!‚Äô: The Colonial Antipolitics of Indigenous Consultation in Jasper National Park.‚Äù Environment and Planning A: Economy and Space 48, no. 7 (July 2016): 1374‚Äì92. https://doi.org/10.1177/0308518X16640530. Similarly in 1907, with the creation of Jasper National Park, M√©tis families who had been living in the area were suddenly declared \\"squatters\\". The Rocky Mountains Park Act (1887) explicitly stated the provision by which people could be removed from the land. Sections 3 and 4 of the Rocky Mountains Act stated that \\"no person shall locate, settle upon, use or occupy any portion of the said public park\\" and gave the Minister of the Interior and Governor in Council the right to make regulations for \\"the removal and exclusion of trespassers\\". While these policies of forcible removal of Indigenous people on park lands were practised under the name of conservation, the government of Canada was simultaneously building permanent towns within parks to house tourists in early national parks such as Banff and Jasper. = Reintegration of cultural landscapes in National Parks Act = Since the early 1970's, Parks Canada has adopted more inclusive policies in the development of new national parks. Many of the changes within Parks Canada has been driven by legal precedent in Canada regarding Aboriginal title to land. The landmark Calder Case which eventually led to the development of the federal government's Comprehensive land claim process in particular pushed the Parks Canada Agency to enhance their relationship with Indigenous people in Canada . The introduction of the first national park reserves by Parks Canada in 1972 signalled a shift in the agency's idea of Aboriginal rights within national parks. In 1974, the National Parks Act was further amended to include provisions for traditional hunting and fishing within national park reserves. This was the first time that Parks Canada had adopted the concept of cultural landscapes and park reserves became a new concept as land set out for a future national park pending the settlement of an unresolved land claim. Section 40 of Canada National Parks Act (2000) stipulates the right of traditional harvesting by stating, \\"the application of this Act to a park reserve is subject to the carrying on of traditional renewable resource harvesting activities by aboriginal persons\\" (2000, c.32, s.40).  Ecological integrity of national parks  Section 8(2) of the Canada National Parks Act (2000) outlines the maintenance or restoration of ecological integrity of national parks as the main priority for the Parks Canada Agency (though some have questioned Parks Canada's commitment to this pledge).‚ÄúProtecting Canada‚Äôs National Parks: A Call for Renewed Commitment to Nature Conservation.‚Äù Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society 2016 Parks Report, 2016. https://cpaws.org/uploads/CPAWS-Parks-Report-2016.pdf. According to the Canada National Parks Act, ecological integrity within a national park is defined as \\"a condition that is determined to be characteristic of its natural region and likely to persist, including abiotic components and the composition and abundance of native species and biological communities, rates of change and supporting processes\\". This means that ecosystems are considered to have ecological integrity when their native components, such as physical elements, biodiversity and ecosystem processes, are intact. In their 2016 Parks Report, the environmental organization, Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS), raised a concern about whether the Parks Canada Agency was effectively implementing the Canada National Parks Acts commitment to conservation. They highlighted that only 13% of the Parks Canada Agency's spending on national parks was dedicated to spending on conservation specifically. In response to such criticism, Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine Mckenna promised a renewed focus of the Agency on conservation within parks with special attention to protecting ecological integrity and implementing more science-based decision-making. A 2018 study by Environment and Climate Change Canada, found that, of 118 ecosystems assessed in 42 of the national parks, the majority of park ecosystems are in stable condition although freshwater and tundra ecosystems are experiencing the highest rates of poor ecological integrity with a declining trend.Environment and Climate Change Canada (2018) Ecological Integrity of National Parks, 2018.

Although never directly connected by rail, the depot was situated less than from Birkenhead Central railway station. The depot serviced steam and subsequently diesel locomotives until 1985, when it was closed and demolished. As of 2018, the site of the depot is still disused. History =Construction to nationalisation= North London Railway Class 75 in 1948. The Birkenhead Railway was formed on 1 August 1859 as a result of the Birkenhead, Lancashire and Cheshire Railway merging with the Chester and Birkenhead Railway. The new company was originally called the Birkenhead, Lancashire and Cheshire Junction Railway, but in 1859 shortened its name to The Birkenhead Railway. Taken over on 1 January 1860, it became a joint railway owned and operated by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) and the Great Western Railway (GWR), becoming a joint railway. The new partners need new and better servicing facilities for their fleets, and so built the new joint-depot in 1878. The shed consisted of two separate but conjoined 8-road straight sheds: *LNWR: to the north, an 8-road pitched-roof shed. Coaling stage to the west, turntable at the shed throat *GWR: to the south and closest to the running lines, an 8-road north light pattern roofed shed. Coaling stage to the west, turntable to the south on an entrance siding. Originally coded BHD, it later became 24 =British Railways= On nationalisation, the entire depot came under the control of British Railways London Midland Region, allocated code 6C. Steam locomotives stabled at the depot included: GWR 6800 Class; GWR 5101 Class; GWR 5700 Class; LMS Black Fives; LMS 8F class; and BR standard class 9F. In 1951, the ex-LNWR shed was reduced in scale by half its width, to allow the construction of a new 2-road straight diesel shed in its place. The LNWR coal stage was removed, meaning all coaling moved to the southern GWR coal stage. A new diesel fuelling stage was built on the entrance throat to the new diesel depot. LMS 8F 2-8-0, BR 9F 2-10-0s and LMS 5MT 4-6-0s on the shed in October 1967 Common sights in the 1950s were WD Austerity 2-8-0s and Stanier 'Crab's, with six of the latter usually at the shed at any one time. Allocated shunters included Dock Tanks 47160, 47164 and 47166. In 1963 as the Beeching cuts were felt, the entire ex- GWR allocation of locos was removed and sent south to Swindon Works for reallocation or scrapping. Nonetheless, up to ninety locomotives on shed could still be seen, on occasion. About half of these would be BR Standard Class 9F 2-10-0s, which worked the heavy iron ore trains from Bidston Dock to the John Summers steelworks in Shotton. The final day of steam operations at the shed was 5 November 1967. The depot code was 8H, between September 1963 and May 1973 and finally BC between May 1973 and closure, in 1985. Diesel era After closure to steam, 9F duties were taken over by Brush Type 4s. During the final years of the depot, locomotives stabled included Class 03, Class 25, Class 40 and Class 47 traction. Class 03s were also allocated to the depot. In the early 1980s, circa. 1984, during the Merseyrail changeover from Class 503 to Class 508 electric multiple units, those units were also stored at the depot. The depot was closed on 25 November 1985, and demolished in July 1987. Notes References =Sources=  Further reading * External links * Photographic collection of steam locomotives at the shed.

The park features two lakes, which were opened more recently in 1970. They are man-made and were built as a result of gravel extraction at the time of the building of the A1(M) motorway, although the thought of a riverside park had been considered since the city's Master Plan of 1949. The whole park is completely man-made from an old quarry site creating the lakes and the hills around them. The Boating Lake (the northern lake) at Stanborough is in size. It is a shallow lake, under three feet in depth with several small islands.The boating lake is fed by water from the River Lea at its north end and from a spring. Excess water flows over a weir back into the river at the south end. Coarse fish such as carp are bred in the boating lake and fishing is banned here. Rowing boats are available to hire at only ¬£7.50. The boating lake also sells ice-creams, chocolate bars, fizzy drinks, fishing nets, hot drinks, duck food and more. The Sailing Lake (the southern lake) is in size. This lake has no islands but is deeper than the boating lake, more than six and a half feet deep in places. Unlike the Boating Lake the Sailing Lake is ground water fed. Before the lakes were built the River Lea used to flow through part of the Sailing Lake but it was re-directed to the west side. Many watersport activities take place here, including sailing, windsurfing and angling. At the south end of the park there is access to Stanborough Reedmarsh, a Local Nature Reserve managed by the Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust. In November 2008, several hundred Lombardy Poplar trees in the South Car Park were chopped down by Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council despite widespread local protest.

They are built during a training phase. A set of images, together with coordinates of landmarks that appear in all of the images, is provided to the training supervisor. The model was first introduced by Edwards, Cootes and Taylor in the context of face analysis at the 3rd International Conference on Face and Gesture Recognition, 1998. Cootes, Edwards and Taylor further described the approach as a general method in computer vision at the European Conference on Computer Vision in the same year. The approach is widely used for matching and tracking faces and for medical image interpretation. The algorithm uses the difference between the current estimate of appearance and the target image to drive an optimization process. By taking advantage of the least squares techniques, it can match to new images very swiftly. It is related to the active shape model (ASM). One disadvantage of ASM is that it only uses shape constraints (together with some information about the image structure near the landmarks), and does not take advantage of all the available information ‚Äì the texture across the target object. This can be modelled using an AAM. References  Some reading  * T. F. Cootes, C. J. Taylor, D. H. Cooper, and J. Graham. Training models of shape from sets of examples.

However, the actual Birkenhead North engine shed, as it was then named, was located to the north of the present depot, on the goods line to the docks.Disused Stations: Birkenhead North engine shed =Recent history= The entrance gates of Birkenhead North TMD In 1985 and 1986, in order to celebrate the 100th anniversary of railways in the area, an \\"100 Years of Mersey Railways\\" was held. Birkenhead North depot was used to hold two open days, and during both events, a number of mainline locomotives were on display at the depot. Among the locomotives which were included in the celebratory events were a Class 40 locomotive (40122, ex D200) as well as a Class 50 locomotive (50007 Sir Edward Elgar, ex Hercules).Rail magazine Issue 58 - \\"Merseyrail 100 celebrations\\" =Future= Merseyrail's fleet of and 508 units is scheduled to be replaced between 2019 and 2021 by a fleet of units built by Stadler Rail at Bussnang, Switzerland. As part of the overall fleet replacement project, which will cost ¬£460 million, both Kirkdale and Birkenhead North depots will be upgraded to a standard which will be capable of maintaining the new trains. As part of its refurbishment, Birkenhead North TMD will have its carriage wash plant upgraded, with the depot becoming more of a focus for cleaning, stabling and light maintenance, a role which is currently fulfilled by Kirkdale TMD. Unlike with the arrangement for the current fleet of Class 507 and 508 units, Birkenhead North will not be the main maintenance hub for the new fleet of Class 777s, with this role being assigned to a rebuilt Kirkdale depot instead. Allocation Currently, and electric multiple units are based at Birkenhead North depot. From 2020 onwards, units will be allocated here. Previously, battery locomotives and locos have been stored at the depot in the past for sandite duties in the winter. Network Rail stables its MPV diesel unit(s) here occasionally during the leaf fall season. Departmental equipment for Sandite duties has in the past included Class 73 (/0 and /9), Class 97/7 and traction. Four diesel shunters (03073, 03162, 03170 and 03189) were also previously allocated to Birkenhead North depot. These locomotives were deployed on dock shunting duties on the now disused Birkenhead Dock Branch, serving in this role until 1989. After the Class 03s became surplus to requirements, all four examples were sold to railway heritage preservation groups.

Situated adjacent to Bescot Stadium station, the depot with code BS is currently operated by DB Schenker Rail (UK). Bescot Yard is to the south- east of the depot. This entire complex of track is clearly visible from the northern end of the M6 and M5 motorway junction. History The line via Aston, Perry Barr and Bescot is the former Grand Junction Railway, opened in 1837. The section between Walsall and Cannock was constructed by the South Staffordshire Railway. The section between Cannock and Rugeley was constructed by the Cannock Mineral Railway. Bescot Yard was opened to handle coal and goods traffic in the Birmingham area, and so needed a depot to provide and service a wide range of locomotives. After the LMS took over in 1923, the shed code became 3A. The shed was rebuilt as a straight-road pre-cast concrete structure with brick infill sides in the 1930s. The line between Walsall and Rugeley Trent Valley closed to passengers in 1965, remaining open to freight. This brought about the closure of the LMS steam shed, and the opening of the diesel shed. The Walsall line then reopened to passengers in stages. The diesel depot, itself, was opened by British Rail in May 1967 as a three-track through-road shed, with an adjoining one-track through-road shed for fuelling. By 1987, the depot had an allocation of Classes 08, 20, 31 and 47 diesel locomotives. Classes 45, 56, and 58 could also be seen stabled at the depot. =Post-privatisation= After the sell-off of British Rail, the shed was allocated to primary operate English Welsh and Scottish Railway. However, after the down turn in traffic post the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08, since 2009 the depot had no allocation of locomotives and was only used for light maintenance and fueling. In December 2013, the former LMS steam Sheds still remained but were isolated from the system and boarded up. Bescot steam shed was demolished during December 2013 and had completely vanished by February 2014 Future In 2012, Transport authority Centro urged the UK Government to look at making Bescot into a freight station instead of constructing a new station from scratch, in order to cope with increasing freight services. A re- opening of the South Staffordshire Line between Stourbridge and Walsall (it has been closed as far as Brierley Hill since 1993) is also proposed, which would allow freight trains to enter Bescot TMD via the Bescot curve.

The depot was the main facility for the storage and servicing of locomotives and multiple-units from Paddington. The depot codes were OC for the diesel depot and OO for the carriage shed. In steam days the shed code was 81A. The area is also where two Great Western Railway main lines divide: the 1838 route to via , and the 1906 \\"New North Main Line\\" (present-day Acton‚ÄìNortholt line) via to Northolt Junction, the start of the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway line. The former is in use for regular passenger services; the latter is used overwhelmingly by freight trains and empty coaching stock movements. The 'HST' section of Old Oak Common TMD, more commonly known as 'Old Oak Common HST Depot' closed in 2018 with the removal of the InterCity 125s from services on the Great Western Main Line (GWML). This closure was to make way for the development of the HS2 project. Maintenance of the new InterCity Express Trains is being carried out at North Pole IET Depot which is situated opposite the site of Old Oak Common TMD whilst the Night Riviera was transferred to Penzance Long Rock Depot in December 2017. A new depot was built approximately a 1/4 mile to the east of the existing depot, primarily to service and stable the trains that have been ordered for the Elizabeth line project. The depot opened in May 2018 and took the name of the existing depot. History =GWR= GWR 4700 Class 2-8-0 express freight loco 4706 being serviced at Old Oak Common on 15 December 1963 Steam locomotives near the coaling plant, September 1956 Following the reconstruction of Paddington station and the introduction of larger locomotives and new routes, the Great Western Railway (GWR) required a larger depot than that at the 1855 constructed Westbourne Park, at which to service its locomotives and carriages. In 1901, a site was acquired in South Acton, south of the Grand Union Canal and on the upside of the mainline. Taking four years to layout and build, designed by G.J. Churchward, it was the largest depot on the entire GWR system, and set the pattern for similar depots throughout the GWR including Tyseley. It had four undergirder turntables, under six-spans of east-west aligned northern-light pitched roofs. The shed covered a total area of (six bays of } (six bays of ). The roofs were made of wood and steel rafters covered in Welsh slate tiles, supported on steel or cast iron columns, with solid London Brick Company walls. Laid out in an interconnecting 4-square pattern under the roof, each electrically operated turntable was fully boarded, and had 28 tracks spanning from it, able to accommodate locomotives up to in length. The associated repair shop, termed The Factory, was allocated to the northeast front of the depot, with 11 roads approached over an electric traverser, and a 12th road direct from the depot throat. Built in a similar style to the depot, it was by in size, and housed a crane. There were also separate blacksmiths and carpenters workshops, a stores and a general office. The approach to the shed housed a standard GWR pattern coal stage, again the largest on the system. It was approached via a 1:50 gradient brick-arch supported ramp, with 1:80 beyond the stage. In 1938, the approach roads to and from the coal stage were doubled, and in 1942 an ash shelter constructed to protect from Nazi Luftwaffe bombing. The four water tanks housed over the stage held of water, while sand was supplied from a separate sand furnace. The whole depot came into operation from 17 March 1906, and became the head of the GWR London operating division. =British Railways= Class 52) D1000 Western Enterprise, inside the roundhouse in 1964 The former western turntable in 1980s looking east, with \\"The Factory\\" buildings to the rear Throughout its GWR and early BR operational life, the depot remained fairly intact and similar to its original layout. The only major difference by the early 1960s was the addition of a pre-war diesel refuelling stage just north of the repair shop, for use by GWR railcars. With a reduction in steam traction and the implementation of the Beeching cuts, in March 1964 the decision was taken to move the remaining steam locomotive allocation to the 1950s designed Southall MPD, and reconstruct Old Oak Common as a diesel depot. Within a year the majority of the GWR 1906 depot was demolished, with only \\"The Factory\\" repair shop, furthest western turntable and parts of the stores remaining. The main service building had 3 tracks, each holding two locos, with inspection pits, fuel supply points and a washing plant on the approach road. Some of the inspection pits in The Factory were also lengthened and deepened and jacks provided to allow for bogie and spring changing. It opened on 20 October 1965. It was the last of six big diesel depots built for the Western Region, the others being Margam TMD 1960, Bristol Bath Road depot 1960, Laira Traction Maintenance Depot, Plymouth, 1962, Landore TMD, Swansea, 1963 and Cardiff Canton TMD 1964. Just south of the residual GWR buildings, in the 1960s BR built what was initially the storage depot for the Blue Pullman trains, what later became known as the Coronation Carriage Sidings. In the late 1970s, south of this and almost adjacent to the Great Western Main Line (GWML), BR built a depot for the new InterCity 125 fleet. Until December 2018 these serviced and maintained the Great Western Railway InterCity 125 fleet. In 1997 a new bespoke depot was constructed at the southern end of the site, between the Great Western depot and the main line, funded by the British Airports Authority to service and maintain the Heathrow Express and Heathrow Connect service trains. This was the first new privately funded train depot in the UK since the British railways nationalisation in 1948. The inauguration of the Heathrow Express services saw the electrification of the GWML from Paddington to Hayes and onto Heathrow Airport using 25 kV overhead catenary. On 26 July 2002, First Great Western opened a new depot on the site of the former carriage sidings to service its Class 180 fleet. The residual GWR buildings were used from the 1970s to house and maintain singular diesel locomotives, special trains, and maintain carriages and freight stock in the area. On the privatisation of BR, the buildings were allocated to English Welsh & Scottish, and latterly operated by its commercial subsidiary Axiom Rail. From 2000 onwards, developments were focused on the southern section of the former GWR site, either side of the 1970s BR High Speed Train depot. Added to in width, this allowed this part of the depot to service all Classes operated by Great Western Railway, Heathrow Express and Heathrow Connect. The allocation was: *Class 332 ‚Äì four- and five- coach EMU used on Heathrow Express services. *Class 360 ‚Äì five-coach EMU used on TFL Rail services to Heathrow By the end of 2009, from north to south, the site layout was: *Residual 1905 GWR Factory buildings and northwestern turntable: EWS & Axiom Rail *1960's Coronation Carriage Sidings: GWR Class 180 Adelante *1970's Intercity 125: GWR 125 Intercity *1997 Depot: Heathrow Express Class 332 and Class 360 *GWR Mainline *Northpole Depot - vacant Present and redevelopment View from western end of depot in 2007, showing: (far left) residual GWR buildings; (left) Coronation Carriage Sidings; (centre) dividing fence; (right) Great Western Railway depot Powercar 43093 in the Legends of the Great Western livery at Old Oak Common depot, in September 2017 All Eras of the Legends of the Great Western at Old Oak Common depot, in September 2017 In May 2009, EWS vacated their site. This part of the site, together with the adjacent Coronation Carriage Sidings was fenced off due to compulsory purchase for the Crossrail project. All the remaining GWR Factory buildings and the Coronation Carriage Sidings were demolished by mid-2011, with the former northwestern shed turntable donated to the Swanage Railway. As a result of the development of the new HS2 station on the site, GWR phased-in a closure programme for its 125 Intercity Fleet depot. In December 2017, maintenance of the Night Riviera was transferred to Penzance Long Rock Depot with the stock laying over at Reading TMD at its northern end. The last HST to run from Old Oak Common ran from OOC to London Paddington station on 8 December 2018. A headboard was attached to the front power car, 43093, which said: \\"81A Old Oak Common LAST HST 8th December 2018\\". 43093 had already been named \\"Old Oak Common HST Depot 1978-2018\\" and was in the Legends of the Great Western Railway livery, but even more was added on this date; a logo which read \\"Old Oak Common History Makers\\" and another sign which read \\"Last HST off Old Oak Common Depot 8th December 2018\\". From 2014 onwards, on the former EWS site and northern part of the former Coronation Sidings, a new depot was built as part of the Crossrail project. Opening on 10 May 2018, it is equipped with stabling and nine maintenance roads. Operated by Bombardier, it provides full servicing, maintenance and storage for the Class 345 trains which from 2019 will operate between Reading on the GWML and Shenfield on the Great Eastern Main Line. As a result, the Heathrow Express depot will close when operation of its services is taken over by Great Western Railway in 2019. (As of 2020 this has not yet taken effect) Old Oak Common railway station will open in 2026 as a major interchange station between the GWML, Crossrail, Heathrow Express and High Speed 2 line from London Euston to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. North Pole depot South of the line is North Pole depot, also approximately half a mile south-west of Willesden TMD. Until 2007, Eurostar trains which operate the Channel Tunnel had its UK maintenance base here. With the opening of the new international terminal at St Pancras railway station, all servicing was moved to the new Temple Mills depot located near Stratford International. In 2013, the depot was partially redeveloped by Hitachi Rail to become a maintenance centre for the new and trains that began entering service in 2017 as part of the Intercity Express Programme.

Biography Having studied philosophy at Prague, he pursued his theological and juridical studies at the University of Bologna, after which he returned to Cracow, where he held the office of canon and custodian of the church of Sandomierz. About 1218 he accompanied his uncle Ivo, Bishop of Cracow, to Rome.

In 1219 Pope Honorius III invited Saint Dominic and his companions to take up residence at the ancient Roman basilica of Santa Sabina, which they did by early 1220. Hyacinth and Ceslaus along with their companions Herman and Henry were among the first to enter the studium of the Dominican Order at Rome out of which would grow the 16th-century College of Saint Thomas at Santa Maria sopra Minerva and the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in the 20th century. After an abbreviated novitiate Ceslaus, Hyacinth and their companions received the religious habit of the Order from St. Dominic himself in 1220.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07591b.htm Accessed 2-17-2013 Their novitiate completed, St. Dominic sent the young friars back as missionaries to their own country. Establishing a friary at Friesach in Austria, they proceeded to Cracow whence Ceslaus was sent by St. Hyacinth to Prague, the metropolis of Bohemia. Labouring with much fruit throughout the Diocese of Prague, Ceslaus went to Wroc≈Çaw, where he founded a large priory, and then extended his apostolic labours over a vast territory, embracing Bohemia, Poland, Pomerania, and Saxony. Sometime after the death of St. Hyacinth he was chosen the Provincial Superior for Poland. Whilst he was superior of the convent of Wroc≈Çaw all Poland was threatened by the Mongols.

He was director of the National Historical Museum, formerly a Bulgarian Socialist Party member, and later became affiliated with the Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) political party. Biography Born in Sozopol to a family of Bulgarian refugees from Eastern Thrace (now part of Turkey), he was given access to the Vatican Secret Archives in the 1980s, regarded as a great achievement considered the political situation of the time. As the director of the National Historical Museum, he had an indirect conflict in 1997‚Äì1998 with the President Petar Stoyanov regarding whether to return the Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya rough copy to the Zograf Monastery or leave it in Bulgaria. Being a member of the Supreme Party Council of BSP, he declared himself openly against the party in 2005 by not supporting BSP Mayor of Sofia candidate Tatyana Doncheva and instead favouring the independent Boyko Borisov. Because of this he was taken down from the post of BSP municipal councillors leader in Sofia. Before the 2009 Bulgarian parliamentary election, Dimitrov formally left BSP and joined Borisov's GERB. He was the party's candidate for 2nd MMC ‚Äì Burgas in the first-past-the-post vote and won the election with 35.92%. He finished ahead of Volen Siderov, the leader of the nationalist Attaka. Dimitrov is the author of 30 treatises and over 250 articles and papers in the sphere of his research, as well as several books (including The Ten Lies of Macedonism and Twelve Myths in Bulgarian History). He has specialized in palaeography in Paris and also hosts the patriotic history-related Pamet Balgarska (Bulgarian Memory) show on Kanal 1. Dimitrov believes that the Bulgars played a more important role in the formation of the contemporary Bulgarians as a people than previously believed. He was Minister without portfolio responsible for Bulgarians abroad in the GERB government (July 2009 ‚Äì February 2011). Controversy Although serious researchers maintain that Dimitrov‚Äôs views on Bulgarian history are biased and can be partially challenged, they are popular in Bulgaria and he enjoys credibility among nationalist intellectuals.Modernity and tradition: European and national in Bulgaria, Marko Hajdinjak, Maya Kosseva, Antonina Zhelyazkova, International Center for Minority Studies and Intercultural Relations, Sofia, , 2012.Europe and the Historical Legacies in the Balkans, Raymond Detrez, Barbara Segaert, Peter Lang, 2008, , p. 10.Bulgaria and Europe: Shifting Identities, Stefanos Katsikas, Anthem Press, 2011, , p. 170.De Palerme √Ä Penang, Fran√ßois Ruegg, Andrea Boscoboinik, Christian Giordano, LIT Verlag M√ºnster, 2010, , p. 184.

The Ten Lies of Macedonism Bozhidar Dimitrov's book, The Ten Lies of Macedonism (2000, 2003 and 2007), is a polemical pamphlet, based on historical documents, and is openly against the ideology of \\"Macedonism\\", i.e. the form of ethnic Macedonian nationalism that asserts an \\"allegedly deep-rooted ethnic and cultural distinction\\" between ethnic Macedonians and Bulgarians. The book has caused considerable controversy and criticism from ethnic Macedonian sources.

Richard Steadman (born 1937) is a specialist knee surgeon, practicing in Vail, Colorado and a Clinical Professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. He is best known medically for his work in the area of microfracture surgery, and publicly for treating injured sports stars from around the world. Richard Steadman is also known throughout the medical world as the man who diagnosed and treated the first ever case of Boothy Knee, this is a chronic knee injury that has ruined the football career‚Äôs of some of the worlds most talented footballers. In January 2014, he announced that he was retiring from his surgical practice.  Biography  Born in Sherman, Texas, Following internship, two years in the US Army, and residency at Charity Hospital in New Orleans; Steadman moved to Lake Tahoe, California where he practiced orthopaedics, with increasing emphasis on the treatment of knee disorders. His first sports client was Cindy Nelson, and from 1976 he was named Chief Physician for the United States Ski Team. In 1989, his work was recognized with his election to the U.S. National Ski Hall of Fame. Steadman served as a director of RBio, Inc. from 1990 to 2002. Looking to move from Tahoe, in 1990 Cindy Nelson and then Vail, Colorado owner George N. Gillett, Jr., persuaded Steadman and shoulder-and-arm-specialist Richard Hawkins, to relocate east and form the Steadman-Hawkins clinic. They also started a non-profit sports medicine foundation in order to conduct research on knee surgery and rehabilitation projects, known as the Steadman- Hawkins Sports Medicine Foundation. Steadman has since developed numerous techniques for knee surgery and rehabilitation that have made him a world- renowned expert on sports injuries. With the increasing strain on sports stars to create quick movement creating additional strain and failure on the knee joint, Steadman has an expanding list of sports clients. However, he states that: On January 29, 2014, he announced that he was retiring from active surgical practice, however, he plans to continue consulting with his physician colleagues at The Steadman Clinic and serving as co-chairman of the Steadman Philippon Research Institute . He said, \\"I cannot imagine a more fulfilling career than the one I have had as an orthopaedic physician. I'm lucky to have had so many patients determined to win again in their sports after serious knee injuries. Their will to succeed has played a large part in my success in treating them.

The album was met with both positive reviews by critics and popularity, especially in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. The first single released from the album was \\"Crimen\\", which received airplay starting in April 2006 and gained huge popularity in Latin America and Spain. The second single, released in September was \\"La Excepci√≥n\\". The album was certified Platinum in Argentina with only pre-ordered sales, and attained Gold status in Mexico. On November 2, 2006, the album received the Latin Grammy for Best Rock Solo Vocal Album and \\" Crimen\\" won the category for Best Rock Song. The album was also nominated for Album of the Year, but lost to Shakira's Fijaci√≥n Oral Vol. 1. The third single released from the album was \\"Adi√≥s\\", which played on radio and TV stations in Latin America beginning in February 2007. In 2008, Cerati released two more singles from the album, \\"Lago En El Cielo\\", the fourth song on the album, and \\"Me Quedo Aqu√≠,\\" the fifth. Cerati toured Latin America, Spain and the USA to promote the album, and also performed for the very first time in London, playing at The Forum on October 12. The name \\"Ah√≠ Vamos\\" (\\"There We Go\\") was a phrase repeated many times during the recording sessions, which came to be a war cry for Cerati during the time. On August 29, 2007, the album's second single \\"La Excepci√≥n\\" received two Latin Grammy nominations: Record of the Year and Best Rock Song, winning the later and beating Argentine band La Renga and Uruguayan band Cuarteto de nos, among others.

The contestants wore headgear during the fights, which were scheduled for three rounds apiece. Two episodes of the show were aired. In 2002, TV Guide ranked it number 6 on its TV Guide's \\"50 Worst TV Shows of All Time\\" list.  First episode  The first episode aired on March 13, 2002. The fights featured were Danny Bonaduce vs. Barry Williams, Todd Bridges vs. Vanilla Ice and Paula Jones vs. Tonya Harding. *Bonaduce vs. Williams: Bonaduce was introduced by ring announcer Michael Buffer as Danny \\"Boom Boom\\" Bonaduce. He had a GoldenPalace.com temporary tattoo on his back. Williams was billed as \\"Barry Da Butcher.\\" Bonaduce dominated the bout, knocking Williams down five times before Williams' trainer threw in the towel in round two. *Bridges vs. Ice: Bridges was introduced as Todd \\"Mad Dog\\" Bridges. Ice was introduced as \\"Bi-Polar\\". Meanwhile, Ice had Tank Abbott working in his corner. Bridges was in control throughout nearly the entire fight, flooring Ice in rounds one and two. All three judges scored the bout 30-27 in his favor. *Jones vs. Harding: Tonya Harding was billed as \\"TNT,\\" and was also sponsored by GoldenPalace.com. Jones was presented as Paula \\"The Arkansas Pounder\\" Jones. Both contestants declined to have their weights disclosed. Jones reportedly took the bout as a late replacement for Amy Fisher, and she appeared reluctant to fight. She frequently turned and ran away from Harding whenever she was hit, and at one point attempted to hide behind the referee. In the final round, she at last announced that she did not wish to continue with the bout. Harding was awarded the victory by technical knockout.  Second episode  The second episode aired on May 22, 2002. Darva Conger took on Olga Korbut in the opening bout. This fight was followed by Dustin Diamond vs. Ron Palillo and Manute Bol vs. William \\"Refrigerator\\" Perry. Joey Buttafuoco took on Joanie \\"Chyna\\" Laurer in the main event. \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic was first approached to fight Chyna, but he didn't see it as a positive career move to fight with a woman on national television. Adam Carolla was also approached but also declined to fight. He claimed on Loveline that the Fox representative said she'd been \\"talking smack\\" about him. Barry Williams also appeared in this episode, singing \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" before the first bout, and conducting interviews with some of the fighters. *Conger vs. Korbut: Korbut, who had been charged with shoplifting $19 worth of groceries just four months prior to this match, was rocked by Conger on several occasions, but was never knocked down, and managed to last until the final bell. Conger won via unanimous decision. *Diamond vs. Palillo: Palillo, who was introduced as \\"The Pulverizer,\\" attempted to stare Diamond down, and even shoved him after the fighters had been given their pre-fight instructions. Once the bell rang, however, Diamond was in complete control. Palillo was knocked down twice in round two, and the fight was stopped at the time 1:23 in the same round. Palillo finished the bout with a pair of black eyes. Lawrence Leritz was the boxing coach. *Bol vs. Perry: Bol utilized lateral movement and his 102-inch reach to outbox the nearly-immobile Perry, winning a decision by the scores of 30-27 on all cards. Bol stated in a post- fight interview that he would donate his purse to relief efforts for victims of the Second Sudanese Civil War. *Buttafuoco vs. Laurer: Laurer was a late substitute for John Wayne Bobbitt, who had been scratched from the bout after being charged with physically abusing his wife. Former lightweight champion Ray Mancini, calling the fight for FOX, expressed the opinion that the decision could conceivably go either way. However, Buttafuoco appeared to dominate the fight, giving Laurer a swollen eye. Despite this, one judge scored the match even, and the other two scored in favor of Buttafuoco with scores of 29-27 and 29-28.

Early life Jokonya was born in the Charter District, since renamed Chikomba and attended Lourdes Mission and Kutama College before training as a primary schoolteacher. After six years he was promoted to be Headmaster of Badza Primary School. While at work he continued to study for qualifications by post, passing GCE O and A levels, and then went to the University of Rhodesia. Academic career In 1965 Jokonya became more involved in politics and was appointed as Secretary for Political Affairs by the National Union of Zimbabwe Students. The NUZS supported majority rule and after the Unilateral Declaration of Independence Jokonya left the country, fearing that he would be detained. After travelling through Botswana, and Zambia he settled in Nairobi, Kenya where he enrolled at the University for a History degree. Jokonya was a good student and was awarded a Commonwealth Scholarship for a postgraduate degree at the University of Sussex School of African Studies in 1968, at which he wrote a dissertation on military intervention in politics in Africa. He followed this with a thesis on colonial land policy in Malawi, and went on to the University of London's Institute of Education where he was awarded a Postgraduate Certificate in Education in 1971. He taught in Birmingham for six years in the 1970s. In January 2002, he received an MA in Government and Politics, and a Certification in International Law and Diplomacy at St. John's University in New York. Return to Zimbabwe With the advent of majority rule, Dr Jokonya returned and was employed as a lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe, specialising in modern British and European history. However, he was swiftly recruited to be part of the new ZANU PF government as deputy permanent secretary in the Ministry of Youth, Sport and Recreation in 1980. In 1983 Dr Jokonya was appointed as Zimbabwean ambassador to Ethiopia. As such he was also permanent representative to the Organisation of African Unity. Dr Jokonya returned from this post to be Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Political Affairs in 1988, and took the additional role of Secretary for Foreign Affairs in 1990. He became concerned about expenditure on diplomatic missions and set them spending targets, while also pressing for returns to Zimbabwe through increased exports; he set up a statistical monitoring system to make sure the expected benefits were being delivered. United Nations In 1992 Dr Jokonya became permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, and from 1999 he was promoted to work at the UN headquarters in New York. He was a personal representative of President Robert Mugabe to the G-15 developing countries movement. However, the latter part of his term saw him defending Zimbabwe against attempts by some European countries to impose sanctions arising out of their opposition to Zimbabwean land reform policies. Dr Jokonya was a personal beneficiary of the land reform, being allocated three formerly white-owned farms. In 2003, he was appointed the chief executive officer of the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority, an appointment inspired by the need to improve the foreign currency earning power of the Zimbabwean tourism market. He refocused marketing to seek tourists from China, France and South Africa instead of the United States, United Kingdom and Germany, saying \\"It is wrong to send attaches to countries which we are fighting against\\". His term saw a rapid increase in the number of tourists coming to Zimbabwe from Asia. Information Minister Following the 2005 election, Dr Jokonya was appointed Minister of Information. In contrast to the previous Minister Jonathan Moyo, Dr Jokonya tried to reach out to media sources which were less friendly to the Zimbabwe government. However, he frequently suggested that journalists should remember their patriotism, and was highly critical of those who wrote stories critical of Zimbabwe government policies for foreign media. According to Jan Raath in The Times, he described them as traitors and then said \\"You know what the end of a traitor is? Death.\\" On taking up his office, Dr Jokonya offered regular meetings with journalists to discuss their coverage. He told them \\"I would want to make presentations to them on various subjects and one area I would want to deliver a paper on is on human rights because this term has been viewed from an Anglo-Saxon perspective.\\" He worked to restructure Zimbabwe Broadcasting Holdings, which had been created as an umbrella company when the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation was split up. In the week before he died he announced that the multitude of companies would be merged into two (Zimbabwe Television Services and Zimbabwe Radio Services) with ZBH having one group chief executive officer and two managing directors. He was found dead in his hotel room on 24 June 2006.

He also represented the Scotland national football team on one occasion against Austria at Hampden Park. Glasgow. Baird started his professional playing career aged 21 with Scottish Football League side Airdrieonians, whom he joined from Dalry Thistle. A striker, he quickly gained a reputation as a prolific goal scorer. In 1957 Leeds United signed him for ¬£12,000 but he only stayed one season in England. In 1958 Aberdeen paid a then club record transfer fee of ¬£11,500 to ensure his return north. He stayed with Aberdeen until 1962 making 86 appearances for the Dons. Baird continued playing football for another 5 years following his departure from Pittodrie, enjoying a very brief spell with Brechin City and not featuring in the Brechin first team, before moving into the Highland Football League for longer spells with Deveronvale FC, the Banff Highland League Club, followed by a three-year spell at Rothes FC on Speyside, Morayshire, before retiring from football, aged 36, to become a bricklayer. Both Highland League clubs were in convenient rail commuting distance from his home in Aberdeen where he had settled following his transfer from Leeds United, and where he lived with his family until his death in June 2006 at 76 years of age. Baird made one appearance for the Scottish national side in May 1956 at Hampden Park against Austria. He only received an international cap in 2006, after a successful campaign was started by Gary Imlach calling for his father and other affected players (including Baird) to receive caps.

She is best known for having taken part in the Algeciras Campaign, and for having run aground during the First Battle of Algeciras on 5 July 1801, which resulted in her capture. She then served in the French Navy until she was broken up in 1824. Early service Hannibal was commissioned in August 1787, under Captain Roger Boger. In May 1790, Hannibal was recommissioned under Captain John Colpoys. She was recommissioned in August 1791, for service as a guardship at Plymouth. When war with France became increasing likely towards end of 1792, the guardships at the three naval seaports were ordered to rendezvous at Spithead. Hannibal and the other Plymouth-based ships left on 11 December and arrived at Spithead the next day. The guardships from the other ports took longer to arrive.Publications of the Navy Records Society, (1951), Vol. 91. On 15 February 1793, she and left on a cruise during which at some point they pursued two French frigates. They captured a French merchant ship, Etoille du Matin, on 23 February. They returned on 4 March. They then were fitted for service in the West Indies and on 24 March left with the fleet under Rear-Admiral Sir Alan Gardner. Hannibal returned to Britain in early 1794, and underwent fitting at Plymouth from March to December. Captain John Markham took command of Hannibal in August 1794. On 10 April 1795, Rear- Admiral Colpoys, while cruising with a squadron composed of five ships of the line and three frigates, chased three French frigates. got within gunshot of one of them and opened fire, at which the frigates took different courses. and Hannibal pursued two; the 32-gun fifth-rate frigate pursued and captured the 36-gun Gloire after an hour-long fight at the Action of 10 April 1795. The next day Hannibal captured the 32-gun , but Fraternit√© escaped. Gentille lost eight men killed and fifteen wounded; Hannibal had four men wounded. The Royal Navy took into service. Ten British warships, Hannibal being one of them, shared in the proceeds of the recapture of the on 28 March 1795 and the capture on 30 March of the French privateer corvette Jean Bart. (The Navy took Jean Bart into service as .) On 14 May 1795, Hannibal sailed for Jamaica. On 21 October, while on the West Indies station, Hannibal captured the 8-gun French privateer schooner Grand Voltigeur. Three days later she captured the 12-gun French privateer Convention. On 13 November she captured the French privateer Petit Tonnerre. Markham left Hannibal in December. His successor, in January 1796, was Captain T. Lewis. On 27 January 1796, Hannibal and captured the privateer Alerte. Alerte was armed with 14 guns and Sampson was the actual captor. Captain Robert Campbell assumed command in April 1798. Captain E.T. Smith followed him in October, and remained in command until 1800, when Captain John Loring replaced him, only to pay Hannibal off later that year. Defeat and loss Captain Solomon Ferris commissioned her in March 1801, and under his command she sailed from Spithead on 6 June 1801. She joined Rear- Admiral Sir James Saumarez in Cawsand Bay on 12 June, ready to sail for the Mediterranean. On the morning of 6 July Saumarez's squadron of six line-of- battle ships attacked French Admiral Linois's three line-of-battle ships and a frigate in Algeciras Bay. Hannibal was the last in and she anchored ahead of , Saumarez's flagship. From there she fired broadsides for about an hour. At about 10 o'clock Ferris Saumarez ordered Hannibal to cut her cables and move to support by engaging Formidable, Linois's flagship. As Hannibal manoeuvred, the variable winds pushed her into shoal water and she grounded. Still, from his immobile position, Ferris maintained fire on Formidable with those of his forward guns that could bear on her; the other guns fired at the town, batteries and gunboats. Saumarez sent boats from Caesar and to assist Hannibal but a shot demolished Caesars pinnace; Ferris then used one of his own cutters to send them back to Caesar. At about 1:30pm the British ships withdrew to Gibraltar, leaving Hannibal immobile and unsupported. Ferris consulted with his officers and decided that further resistance was pointless and that the only way to save the lives of the remaining crew was for Hannibal to strike. By this point Hannibals fire had dwindled to almost nothing so Ferris ordered his men to shelter below decks. He then signalled capitulation by hoisting Hannibals ensign upside down. The battle had cost Hannibal 75 men killed, 62 wounded and six missing. Commander George Dundas, deceived by a signal from Hannibal, sent boats from to save Hannibals crew. The French detained the boats and their crews, including Calpes lieutenant, T. Sykes; after firing several broadsides at the enemy's shipping and batteries, Calpe returned to Gibraltar.James (1837), 118. The French and Spanish were unable to repair Hannibal quickly enough for her to take part in the eventual defeat of the Franco-Spanish squadron at the Second Battle of Algeciras several days later. Sir James Saumarez then arranged to exchange the men from St Antoine, which the British had captured in the second part of the battle, for the men from Hannibal and Calpe. A court martial on in Portsmouth on 1 September honourably acquitted Captain Ferris, his officers and crew for the loss of their ship. French service The French renamed Hannibal as Annibal. In November 1801 convoyed the Straits fleet to Gibraltar, arriving there on 16 November. On the way they encountered dreadful weather in the Bay of Biscay. While Racoon was near Brest, she observed Hannibal and underway. Both former Royal Navy vessels were under jury-masts and French colours.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 7, p.89. Later, on 9 February 1802, Annibal (along with Intr√©pide and Formidable), sailed from Cadiz for Toulon where she underwent a refit between March and June. Annibal then served in the French Navy until 1821 (undergoing a further refit at Toulon during 1809). She was partly re-armed in 1806, with one pair of upper deck guns being removed, and sixteen 32-pounder carronades replacing ten of her 9-pounder guns. In May 1807, the 38-gun frigate encountered Annibal, two frigates (Pomone and Incorruptible), and the corvette Victorieuse off Cabrera in the Mediterranean but escaped. Fate In January 1821 Annibal became a hulk at Toulon, and was broken up in 1824. See also *List of ships captured in the 19th century Notes Citations References * Beckford Bevan, A. and H.B.

Elrington Ball (1863‚Äì1928), was an Irish author and legal historian, best known for his work The Judges in Ireland 1221‚Äì1921 (1926). Life A younger son of John Thomas Ball (1815 to 1898), the Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1875 to 1880, and his wife Catherine Elrington, Ball was unsuccessful in seeking election (as a Unionist) to Parliament at the 1900 United Kingdom general election in South Dublin. His father had represented Dublin University in Parliament from 1868 to 1875. The Four Courts on fire during the Civil War Ball is, however, best known for his scholarship, particularly for his work on Swift, the local history of Dublin and on the history of the judiciary in Ireland from 1221 to 1921. The destruction of the Four Courts in 1922, during the Irish Civil War, and of the public records and legal archives it contained (especially those of the Irish Public Records Office) made Ball's prior research into the history of the Irish judiciary up to 1921 particularly valuable to later scholars.
