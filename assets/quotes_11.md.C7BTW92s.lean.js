(Others attribute the invention to Theodore Maiman). Gould is best known for his thirty-year fight with the United States Patent and Trademark Office to obtain patents for the laser and related technologies. He also fought with laser manufacturers in court battles to enforce the patents he subsequently did obtain. Early life and education Born in New York City, Gould was the oldest of three sons. His father was the founding editor of Scholastic Magazine Publications in New York City.Taylor (2000), p. 14. He grew up in Scarsdale, a small suburb of New York, and attended Scarsdale High School. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in physics at Union College, where he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity, and a master's degree at Yale University, specializing in optics and spectroscopy.Taylor (2000), p. 16‚Äì20. Between March 1944 and January 1945 he worked on the Manhattan Project but was dismissed due to his activities as a member of the Communist Political Association.Taylor (2000), p. 19‚Äì25. In 1949 Gould went to Columbia University to work on a doctorate in optical and microwave spectroscopy.Taylor (2000), p. 37‚Äì40. His doctoral supervisor was Nobel laureate Polykarp Kusch, who guided Gould to develop expertise in the then-new technique of optical pumping.Taylor (2000), p. 45, 56. In 1956, Gould proposed using optical pumping to excite a maser, and discussed this idea with the maser's inventor Charles Townes, who was also a professor at Columbia and later won the 1964 Nobel prize for his work on the maser and the laser. Townes gave Gould advice on how to obtain a patent on his innovation, and agreed to act as a witness.Taylor (2000), p. 62. Invention of the laser By 1957, many scientists including Townes were looking for a way to achieve maser-like amplification of visible light. In November of that year, Gould realized that one could make an appropriate optical resonator by using two mirrors in the form of a Fabry‚ÄìP√©rot interferometer. Unlike previously considered designs, this approach would produce a narrow, coherent, intense beam. Since the sides of the cavity did not need to be reflective, the gain medium could easily be optically pumped to achieve the necessary population inversion. Gould also considered pumping of the medium by atomic-level collisions, and anticipated many of the potential uses of such a device. The first page of the notebook in which Gould coined the acronym LASER and described the essential elements for constructing one. Gould recorded his analysis and suggested applications in a laboratory notebook under the heading \\"Some rough calculations on the feasibility of a LASER: Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation\\"‚Äîthe first recorded use of this acronym.Taylor (2000), pp. 66‚Äì70. Gould's notebook was the first written prescription for making a viable laser and, realizing what he had in hand, he took it to a neighborhood store to have his work notarized. Arthur Schawlow and Charles Townes independently discovered the importance of the Fabry‚ÄìP√©rot cavity‚Äîabout three months later‚Äîand called the resulting proposed device an \\"optical maser\\". Gould's name for the device was first introduced to the public in a conference presentation in 1959, and was adopted despite resistance from Schawlow and his colleagues. Eager to achieve a patent on his invention, and believing incorrectly that he needed to build a working laser to do this, Gould left Columbia without completing his doctoral degree and joined a private research company, TRG (Technical Research Group).Taylor (2000), pp. 72‚Äì3. He convinced his new employer to support his research, and they obtained funding for the project from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, ironically with support from Charles Townes.Taylor (2000), pp. 74‚Äì90. Unfortunately for Gould, the government declared the project classified, which meant that a security clearance was required to work on it.Taylor (2000), pp. 92‚Äì6. Because of his former participation in communist activities, Gould was unable to obtain a clearance. He continued to work at TRG, but was unable to contribute directly to the project to realize his ideas. Due to technical difficulties and perhaps Gould's inability to participate, TRG was beaten in the race to build the first working laser by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories. Battles for patents During this time, Gould and TRG began applying for patents on the technologies Gould had developed. The first pair of applications, filed together in April 1959, covered lasers based on Fabry‚ÄìP√©rot optical resonators, as well as optical pumping, pumping by collisions in a gas discharge (as in helium‚Äìneon lasers), optical amplifiers, Q-switching, optical heterodyne detection, the use of Brewster's angle windows for polarization control, and applications including manufacturing, triggering chemical reactions, measuring distance, communications, and lidar. Schawlow and Townes had already applied for a patent on the laser, in July 1958. Their patent was granted on March 22, 1960. Gould and TRG launched a legal challenge based on his 1957 notebook as evidence that Gould had invented the laser prior to Schawlow and Townes's patent application. (At the time, the United States used a first to invent system for patents.) While this challenge was being fought in the Patent Office and the courts, further applications were filed on specific laser technologies by Bell Labs, Hughes Research Laboratories, Westinghouse, and others. Gould ultimately lost the battle for the U.S. patent on the laser itself, primarily on the grounds that his notebook did not explicitly say that the sidewalls of the laser medium were to be transparent, even though he planned to optically pump the gain medium through them, and considered loss of light through the sidewalls by diffraction.Taylor (2000), pp. 159, 173. Questions were also raised about whether Gould's notebook provided sufficient information to allow a laser to be constructed, given that Gould's team at TRG was unable to do so.Taylor (2000). Gould was able to obtain patents on the laser in several other countries, however, and he continued fighting for U.S. patents on specific laser technologies for many years afterward. In 1967, Gould left TRG and joined the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, now New York University Tandon School of Engineering, as a professor.Taylor (2000), pp. 172‚Äì5. While there, he proposed many new laser applications, and arranged government funding for laser research at the Institute. Gould's first laser patent was awarded in 1968, covering an obscure application‚Äîgenerating X-rays using a laser. The technology was of little value, but the patent contained all the disclosures of his original 1959 application, which had previously been secret. This allowed the patent office greater leeway to reject patent applications that conflicted with Gould's pending patents.Taylor (2000), p. 180. Meanwhile, the patent hearings, court cases, and appeals on the most significant patent applications continued, with many other inventors attempting to claim precedence for various laser technologies. The question of just how to assign credit for inventing the laser remains unresolved by historians. By 1970, TRG had been bought by Control Data Corporation, which had little interest in lasers and was disposing of that part of the business.Taylor (2000), pp. 190‚Äì3. Gould was able to buy back his patent rights for a thousand dollars, plus a small fraction of any future profits. In 1973, Gould left the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn to help found Optelecom, a company in Gaithersburg, Maryland that makes fiberoptic communications equipment.Taylor (2000), pp. 197‚Äì201. He later left his successful company in 1985. Further patent battles, and enforcement of issued patents Shortly after starting Optelecom, Gould and his lawyers changed the focus of their patent battle. Having lost many court cases on the laser itself, and running out of appeal options, they realized that many of the difficulties could be avoided by focusing instead on the optical amplifier, an essential component of any laser.Taylor (2000), pp. 199‚Äì212. The new strategy worked, and in 1977 Gould was awarded , covering optically pumped laser amplifiers. The laser industry, by then grown to annual sales of around $400 million, rebelled at paying royalties to license the technology they had been using for years, and fought in court to avoid paying. The industry outcry caused the patent office to stall on releasing Gould's other pending patents, leading to more appeals and amendments to the pending patents.Taylor (2000), p. 218. Despite this, Gould was issued in 1979, covering a variety of laser applications including heating and vaporizing materials, welding, drilling, cutting, measuring distance, communication systems, television, laser photocopiers and other photochemical applications, and laser fusion.Taylor (2000), p. 220‚Äì2. The industry responded with lawsuits seeking to avoid paying to license this patent as well. Also in 1979, Gould and his financial backers founded the company Patlex, to hold the patent rights and handle licensing and enforcement.Taylor (2000), p. 221‚Äì3. The legal battles continued, as the laser industry sought to not only prevent the Patent Office from issuing Gould's remaining patents, but also to have the already-issued ones revoked. Gould and his company were forced to fight both in court, and in Patent Office review proceedings. According to Gould and his lawyers, the Office seemed determined to prevent Gould from obtaining any more patents, and to rescind the two that had been granted.Taylor (2000), pp. 237‚Äì247. Things finally began to change in 1985. After years of legal process, the Federal Court in Washington, D.C. ordered the Patent Office to issue Gould's patent on collisionally pumped laser amplifiers. The Patent Office appealed, but was ultimately forced to issue , and to abandon its attempts to rescind Gould's previously issued patents.Taylor (2000), pp. 280‚Äì3. The Brewster's angle window patent was later issued as . The end of the Patent Office action freed Gould's enforcement lawsuits to proceed. Finally, in 1987, Patlex won its first decisive enforcement victory, against Control Laser corporation, a manufacturer of lasers.Taylor (2000), pp. 280‚Äì5. Rather than be bankrupted by the damages and the lack of a license to the technology, the board of Control Laser turned ownership of the company over to Patlex in a settlement deal. Other laser manufacturers and users quickly agreed to settle their cases and take out licenses from Patlex on Patlex's terms. The thirty year patent war that it took for Gould to win the rights to his inventions became known as one of the most important patent battles in history. In the end, Gould was issued forty- eight patents, with the optical pumping, collisional pumping, and applications patents being the most important.Taylor (2000), p. 284. Between them, these technologies covered most lasers used at the time. For example, the first operating laser, a ruby laser, was optically pumped; the helium‚Äìneon laser is pumped by gas discharge. The delay‚Äîand the subsequent spread of lasers into many areas of technology‚Äîmeant that the patents were much more valuable than if Gould had won initially. Even though Gould had signed away eighty percent of the proceeds in order to finance his court costs, he made several million dollars. \\"I thought that he legitimately had a right to the notion to making a laser amplifier\\", said William R. Bennett, who was a member of the team that built the first laser that could fire continuously. \\"He was able to collect royalties from other people making lasers, including me.\\" Election to Hall of Fame and death Even though his role in the actual invention of the laser was disputed over decades, Gould was elected to the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1991. Gould died of natural causes on September 16, 2005. At the time of his death, Gould's role in the actual invention continued to be disputed in scientific circles. Apart from the dispute, Gould had realized his hope to \\"be around\\" when the Brewster's angle window patent expired in May 2005.Taylor (2000), p. 285.

It is defined by its mixture of dissonant noise or feedback with the songcraft more often found in pop music. Shoegazing, another noise-based genre that developed in the 1980s, drew from noise pop.  History and characteristics  Noise pop has been described by AllMusic as \\"the halfway point between bubblegum and the avant- garde\\"; the combination of conventional pop songwriting with experimental sounds of white noise, distorted guitars and drones. Accordingly, the style \\"often has a hazy, narcotic feel, as melodies drift through the swirling guitar textures. But it can also be bright and lively, or angular and challenging.\\" AllMusic cites the Velvet Underground as the earliest roots of the genre, with their experiments with feedback and distortion on their early albums. Early American alternative rock bands like Sonic Youth, Yo La Tengo and Dinosaur Jr., who mixed pop song structures with extreme guitar distortion and feedback, were immediate forerunners. The Jesus and Mary Chain's 1985 debut, Psychocandy, is considered by AllMusic to be the archetype for the noise pop genre (\\"pretty much birthed the style\\"). Kareem Estefan of Stylus Magazine cited the album for \\"transforming the use of distortion in indie rock with its screeching abrasion, yet managing to feature some of the catchiest melodies of the 80s.\\" Later in the 1980s, noise pop was a major inspiration for the British shoegazing movement. Influenced by The Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine started to experiment with a fusion of 1960s pop music and noise on their EP, The New Record by My Bloody Valentine, paving way to their forthcoming shoegazing sound. Noise pop continued to be influential in the indie rock scene into the 1990s. In the 90s and 2000s, popular Neo-psychedelia bands such as The Flaming Lips and later Animal Collective were big proponents of incorporating noise pop within their sound, especially Avey Tare and Panda Bear's acclaimed album Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished.

Cranfield was founded as the College of Aeronautics in 1946. Through the 1950s and 1960s, the development of aircraft research led to growth and diversification into other areas such as manufacturing and management, and in 1967, to the founding of the Cranfield School of Management. In 1969, the College of Aeronautics was renamed the Cranfield Institute of Technology, was incorporated by Royal Charter, gained degree awarding powers, and became a university. In 1993, it adopted its current name. Cranfield University has two campuses: the main campus is at Cranfield, Bedfordshire, and the second is at the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom at Shrivenham, southwest Oxfordshire. The main campus is unique in the United Kingdom (and Europe) for having its own semi-operational airport Cranfield Airport and its own aircraft, used for teaching and research.  History  Cranfield University from the air Cranfield University AIRC College of Aeronautics (1946‚Äì1969) Cranfield University was formed in 1946 as the College of Aeronautics, on the then Royal Air Force base of RAF Cranfield. A major role was played in the development of the college by Roxbee Cox, later Lord Kings Norton, who was appointed to be the first governor of the college in 1945 and then served as vice-chair and (from 1962) chair of the board. He led the drive for the college to diversify, with the Cranfield University School of Management being established in 1967, and petitioned successfully for a royal charter and degree awarding powers. When these were granted in 1969, he became the first chancellor of the Cranfield Institute of Technology, serving until 1997. Cranfield Institute of Technology (1969‚Äì1993) The Cranfield Institute of Technology was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1969, giving the institution its own degree-awarding powers and making it a full university in its own right. In 1975 the National College of Agricultural Engineering, founded in 1963 at Silsoe, Bedfordshire, was merged with Cranfield and run as Silsoe College. An academic partnership with the Royal Military College of Science (RMCS) at Shrivenham was formed in 1984. RMCS, whose roots can be traced back to 1772, is now a part of the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom and from 2009 has been known as \\"Cranfield Defence and Security\\". RMCS became wholly postgraduate in c.2007 with undergraduate courses moved elsewhere.  Cranfield University (1993‚Äìpresent)  In 1993 the institution's Royal Charter was amended changing its name to Cranfield University. A decade later in 2003, Cranfield became wholly postgraduate and the Shrivenham site admitted its last undergraduates. In 2007, the University's first international campus was opened by the Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, located in the Torrens Building in Adelaide, alongside the Carnegie Mellon University. It offered short-term postgraduate degrees in defence management and technology, in partnership with local institutions and using some distance learning courses. However South Australia's \\"defence boom\\" did not materialise and its failure to attract enough students caused the closure of the campus in 2010. In 2009 Silsoe College was closed and its activities were relocated to the main campus at Cranfield.  Location and campus  Cranfield University Library Cranfield campus is approximately north of central London and adjacent to the village of Cranfield, Bedfordshire. The nearest large towns are Milton Keynes and Bedford, the centres of which are both about away. Cambridge is about east. Shrivenham is about west of London, adjacent to Shrivenham village, from the centre of the nearest town, Swindon, and around from Oxford. The Cranfield campus sits within the Cambridge ‚Äì Milton Keynes ‚Äì Oxford corridor where there are plans to link these cities and stimulate economic growth. There is also a proposal for a rapid transit system between (an expanding) Milton Keynes and the campus, although this is still at an early concept stage.  Technology Park  There are a number of companies located on the Cranfield University Technology Park ranging from large international companies to small start-ups. Major companies on the park include: * The Nissan Technical Centre Europe, which designs and develops cars for the European market. The NTC Europe facility occupies of the Technology Park, representing an investment of ¬£46m by Nissan. *Innovation Centre: the Technology Park is also the location for a large number of smaller companies. Prior to 2016: * Trafficmaster plc occupied a site for its European Headquarters. A leading company in telematics, Trafficmaster's advanced technology enables cars and roads to be used more efficiently. Milton Keynes Cranfield University is the academic partner in project with Milton Keynes Council to establish a new university, code-named MK:U, in nearby Milton Keynes. The plan anticipates opening by 2023, with a campus in Central Milton Keynes. In January 2019, the partners announced an international competition to design a new campus near the Central railway station. In May 2019, Santander Bank announced a 'seed funding' grant of ¬£30 million to help with building and initial running costs. On 4 July 2019, the shortlisted proposals for the campus were announced. On 30 July 2019, the evaluation panel announced that Hopkins Architects had produced the winning design.

Dukes of Enghien ‚Äì first creation (1566‚Äì1569) The title was first conferred on Louis I de Bourbon, Prince de Cond√©, whose County of Enghien in modern-day Belgium was elevated to a duchy-peerage in 1566. However, the necessary registration process was not completed, so the title became extinct at his death in 1569. In spite of this legal loophole, from 1569 to 1689 the eldest son of the Prince of Cond√© also held the title of Duke of Enghien. The most famous of them is Louis II, also known as the Great Cond√©, who held the title of Duke of Enghien from his birth in 1621 to his father's death in 1646. Dukes of Enghien ‚Äì second creation (1689‚Äì1830) His grandson Henry II, Prince of Cond√©, inherited the Duchy of Montmorency near Paris in 1633, and in 1689 the Duchy of Montmorency was renamed as Duchy of Enghien for his son Louis II, Prince of Cond√©. The title Duke of Enghien was thereafter used as a courtesy title for the eldest son of the Prince of Cond√©. # 1689‚Äì1709: Henri I, Duke of Enghien (1643‚Äì1709) # 1709‚Äì1710: Louis I, Duke of Enghien (1668‚Äì1710) # 1710‚Äì1740: Louis II Henri, Duke of Enghien (1692‚Äì1740) # 1740‚Äì1818: Louis III Joseph, Duke of Enghien (1736‚Äì1818) # 1818‚Äì1830: Louis IV Henri, Duke of Enghien (1756‚Äì1830) Most often it refers to Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Cond√©, duc d'Enghien (1772‚Äì1804), the son of Louis Henry II, whose execution on trumped-up charges in 1804 during the French Consulate removed any hope of reconciliation between Napoleon Bonaparte and the House of Bourbon. The duke was executed in the moat of the Ch√¢teau de Vincennes. On the death of the last duke in 1830, the title passed to Louis Philippe III, Duke of Orl√©ans, a great-great-grandson of the Louis I, Duke of Enghien through the female line.

The Phonodeik converts sound waves into visual images. The name was suggested by Edward W. Morley. Before electronic oscilloscopes, this device was used for analyzing sounds waves. The Phonodeik can be modified to project sound waves on a screen for public demonstration. Description The Phonodeik used photographic material to record sound. A diaphragm receiver of thin glass is at the end of a resonator horn. Behind the diaphragm is a steel pulley spindle mounted in jeweled bearings with an attached mirror and oscillating tension spring. Wrapped on the pulley spindle are thin silk fibers or platinum wire turning around the mirror with amplitude. The sound vibrates the diaphragm on the bottom and a light beam is reflected to the sensitive photographic paper (or a projection screen).

The many Xiphophorus species are all called either platyfish (or platies) or swordtails. The type species is X. hellerii, the green swordtail. Like most other new world Poeciliids, platies and swordtails are live-bearers that use internal fertilization and give birth to live young instead of laying eggs like the bulk of the world's fishes. The name Xiphophorus derives from the Greek words ŒæŒØœÜŒøœÇ (dagger) and œÜœåœÅŒøœÇ (bearer), referring to the gonopodium on the males. All are relatively small fishes, which reach a maximum length of depending on the exact species involved. Distribution and conservation status The Monterrey platyfish is one of three Xiphophorus species that is restricted to the southern Rio Grande basin and threatened The various Xiphophorus species range from the southern Rio Grande basin in Mexico, through eastern drainages in the country (river basins draining into the Gulf of Mexico), to northern Guatemala, Belize and northern Honduras. Three species and their hybrids are common in the aquarium trade: the green swordtail (X. hellerii), the southern platyfish (X. maculatus) and the variable platyfish (X. variatus). These three are the only species that have large native ranges. They have also been introduced outside their native range (both in Mexico, Central America and other continents) where they sometimes become invasive species that outcompete and endanger native species, including other, more localized members of Xiphophorus. All other species of Xiphophorus are highly localized and mostly endemic to Mexico. Only three of the localized species, the Chiapas swordtail (X. alvarezi), X. mayae and X. signum, range outside Mexico and the last two are the only Xiphophorus species not found in Mexico at all. In many locations there are two sympatric species, but the localized species are mostly (though not entirely) separated from each other, even when they are restricted to the same river basin. This includes three restricted species in the Rio Grande basin (all fully separated), nine restricted species in the P√°nuco River basin (mostly separated) and three restricted species in the Coatzacoalcos River basin (mostly separated). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the spiketail platyfish (X. andersi) and northern platyfish (X. gordoni) as Endangered, while the Monterrey platyfish (X. couchianus) and marbled swordtail (X. meyeri) are listed as Extinct in the wild, and thus only survive in captivity. In addition to those, Mexican authorities recognize the yellow swordtail (X. clemenciae) and Catemaco platyfish (Xiphophorus milleri) as threatened. Almost all the Xiphophorus, including the rare species, have captive populations that are maintained as \\"insurance\\" populations at breeding centers and by dedicated private aquarists. Human uses Xiphophorus species are regularly used in genetic studies, and scientists have developed many interspecific hybrids, especially in melanoma research since the 1920s. The Xiphophorus Genetic stock center, founded by Myron Gordon in 1939, is an important source of these fish for research. In addition, several species are commonly kept by aquarium hobbyists, especially the green swordtail (X. helleri), southern platyfish (X. maculatus), and variable platyfish (X. variatus). In fact, these three species comprise one of the most prominent groups of aquarium species, being part of a group of extremely hardy livebearing fish, alongside the molly and guppy, that can adjust to a wide range of conditions within the aquarium. Unlike some species, these are almost always offered as captive bred individuals due to the ease of breeding these livebearers.  Species and taxonomy  Montezuma swordtail have the proportionally longest tail \\"sword\\" among the swordtails, but as in all species the females lack it Despite its common name, the marbled swordtail is part of the platy group based on its genetics One of the typical captive forms of the variable platyfish There are currently 28 recognized species in this genus, according to FishBase. Two of these species, X. clemenciae and X. monticolus, are likely the result of natural hybrid speciation (ancestors of both are a platy species and a swordtail species). Two other proposed species, X. kosszanderi and X. roseni, are recognized by FishBase, but not by all other authorities, as the first appears to be a hybrid between X. variatus and X. xiphidium, and the second between X. variatus and X. couchianus (X. kosszanderi and X. roseni have not undergone speciation as in X. clemenciae and X. monticolus). Otherwise hybridization in the wild is uncommon in this genus and only known from three or four locations, despite the fact that many sites have two sympatric species. Although traditionally divided into swordtails and platies, this separation is not supported by phylogenetic studies, which have shown that the swordtails are paraphyletic compared with the platies. These studies suggest that the genus can be divided into three monophyletic groups: the northern swordtails (of the P√°nuco River basin, marked with a star* in the list), southern swordtails (southern Mexico to Honduras) and the platies. The common names given to individual species in this genus do not always reflect their actual relationships; for example, the marbled swordtail (X. meyeri) is actually in the platy group based on its genetics while the short-sword platyfish (X. continens) is closer to the swordtails.

It traces its history back to the establishment of the Derby Diocesan Institution for the Training of Schoolmistresses in 1851. It gained university status in 1992. The university provides over 300 study programmes at undergraduate level. Undergraduate programmes as well as short courses, foundation degrees and postgraduate degrees cover most academic disciplines and sub-disciplines. Currently the university is home to around 34,000 students in all areas of study. History Nineteenth century Over the years, two dozen bodies have contributed to the university's formation. The first of these was founded in 1856 as the Derby Diocesan Institution for the Training of Schoolmistresses. Albeit under different names so to reflect maturing objectives, the institution flourished as an individual entity for some 120 years before merging with another developing educational artery to help form what was then known as the Derby Lonsdale College of Higher Education, 1977. The other line of this confluence began in 1853 with the establishment of the Derby School of Art, which in 1870 became the Derby Central School of Art and the Derby Central School of Science. In 1885, the two schools were reformulated into the Derby School of Art and Technical Institution. Less than a decade later however, 1892, three more mergers took place and the institution became the Derby Municipal Technical College. Early twentieth century In 1928, the Technical College split into the Derby School of Art and the Derby Technical College. By 1955, the two had become the Derby and District College of Art (opened on 22 September 1966 by Paul Reilly, Director of the Council of Industrial Design), and the Derby and District College of Technology (opened by the Duke of Edinburgh on 15 May 1964), both situated on Kedleston Road, Allestree. The site was formerly Markeaton Golf Course and cost ¬£2.5m, with a foundation stone placed on 5 July 1957 by Lord (Ernest) Hives, a former managing director of Rolls Royce. Opened by the Duke the day before, the Bishop Lonsdale College in Mickleover was developed for teacher training courses. At the opening ceremony, the duke said \\"qualities needed by teachers are the dedication of a saint, the patience of a watchmaker, the sympathy of parents and the leadership of a general\\". The Duke spent two days in Derby, staying the night nearby at Okeover Hall near Ashbourne as a guest of the Lord Lieutenant of Derbyshire. Half of the places at Mickleover were reserved for C of E trainees and the other half for those with no link to Derby Diocese. 1970-1992: Mergers of higher education colleges in Derbyshire The operational split between the two colleges at Kedleston Road was dissolved in 1972 with a mutual initiative for the creation of the Derby College of Art and Technology. Five years afterwards, and as previously noted, the described educational lineage married itself with Derby's diocesan tradition, which had become known institutionally as the Bishop Lonsdale College of Education at Mickleover. There were about 800 students at Mickleover and 1,200 at Kedleston Road. After the 1977 union and subsequent formation of the Derby Lonsdale College of Higher Education, four other educational institutions would add their respective sector-related talents. In March 1981, the college held its first graduation ceremony with formal academic caps and gowns with only six degrees (out of 156 courses) being ratified by the CNAA. Previous to this, the college's degrees were awarded in a ceremony at the University of Nottingham. The Matlock College of Education, a traditional Church of England teacher training college formed in 1946 at Rockside Hall (now a country hotel), combined with Lonsdale in 1983 to create the Derbyshire College of Higher Education, when the Matlock College was having financial difficulties when funding for teacher training was scaled down when school numbers had dropped. In 1985, this college at Matlock was scaled down significantly and closed in 1986. In 1991 the Southern Derbyshire School of Occupational Therapy united with the college. The Southern Derbyshire School of Radiography did the same in 1992. 1992-1997: Achievement of university status In 1992 the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 allowed the Derbyshire College of Higher Education to become the only school of higher education in the country to be upgraded directly to a university. On 31 October 1992, the T block (science subjects, which lies to the north of the North Tower) was opened by Princess Alice. In January 1994, Britannia MillBritannia Mill, Derby.ac.uk, 2008 (a renovated mill) opened, at a cost of ¬£10M. On 4 March 1994, the B block (business and management subjects, which lies north of the East Tower) was opened by the Conservative MP, Tim Boswell. Later in autumn 1994, the Atrium was built. In November 1997, the Learning Centre (now renamed ‚ÄòUniversity Library‚Äô) was officially opened, having been built on a former car park. The University of Derby was fully invested. 1998-present: New campuses and further mergers In 1998 the University merged with High Peak College of Further Education in Buxton, which is in the North West of the County of Derbyshire. High Peak College was at that time based at premises in Harpur Hill, but moved to the Devonshire Dome in the centre of Buxton in 2005.Devonshire Campus , Derby.ac.uk, 2008 In August 2012 the University merged with Leek College in Leek, Staffordshire. In 2013 the University merged all of its further education education provision into Buxton & Leek College. The College operates at the University's campuses in Buxton, Leek and Kedleston Road in Derby. In October 2016 the University opened a new campus in Chesterfield in the North-East of the County of Derbyshire. This campus, officially entitled 'St. Helena's Campus', is situated in the buildings of what was originally St Helena's Grammar School, which were converted by the University. Campuses and facilities The University has a range of resources and facilities available to all students and staff, including: lecture theatres; Students Union facilities; a bus service operating at and between the campuses; Chaplaincy and facilities for faith, meditation and prayer; indoor and outdoor sports facilities; cafes restaurants and food outlets; wellbeing centres and support; Careers and Employability services and centres; and a University Library service with five Libraries Derby The Devonshire Dome in Buxton Inside the Devonshire Dome The University's main campus is in the city of Derby. The Kedleston Road site in Allestree, in the north-west of Derby is the largest and main campus and serves as the University's headquarters. It is situated close to the A38 and opposite Markeaton Park. A contemporary-styled building for Arts, Design and Media, as well as a STEM building, on Markeaton Street in Derby was formally opened in early November 2007 by Richard Branson. Courses are also run at the Britannia Mill site in Derby. In addition, the University also owns Derby Theatre in Derby city centre where courses in Theatre Arts are delivered. Derby Law School and the Department of Law, Criminology and Social Sciences operate at the One Friar Gate Square building in the centre of Derby The Derby Campus also has a variety of specialist facilities, including computing laboratories, two computer games development suites, a general practice surgery, conference facilities, multi-functional lecture theatres, art and culture venues, concert venues, recording studios, sport centre and fitness suites, outdoor pitches, student union bars and facilities, and a multi-faith centre. Buxton This campus is located in the Grade II* listed 18th century former stable block, the Devonshire Dome. In 1854, the 6th Duke of Devonshire donated the land, part of his stables and some of the funds for conversion to a hospital and gardens for charity patients seeking treatment at the baths in Buxton. His architect, Henry Currey, directed the work. The ironwork dome (1881, once the world's largest, with a diameter of ), a clocktower (1882) and a surgical ward (1897) were built as expansions to the hospital, which was run by the NHS after 1948. The University of Derby purchased the then-derelict hospital from the NHS in 2001, and moved operations here from the Harpur Hill campus in 2005.University of Derby (Buxton) pamphlet, available at the university. The Devonshire Dome building dominates the local landscape, and has a dome which is over in diameter, bigger than that of St Paul's Cathedral in London. It was formally opened as a University Campus by Prince Charles in February 2006. The campus is home to the Centre for Contemporary Hospitality and Tourism and is a delivery site of the College of Life and Natural Science and Buxton & Leek College. Facilities at the Buxton Campus include an internationally recognised and award-winning commercial day spa run by students studying degrees in Spa and Wellness Management, a fine dining restaurant run by students studying degrees in Culinary Arts and Hospitality Management, hair and beauty salon, Dome floor events space, outdoor leadership centre, and motor vehicle engineering facilities. Chesterfield The Chesterfield Campus, officially entitled 'St. Helena's Campus', is situated in the buildings of what was originally St Helena's Grammar School, off Sheffield Road, near Chesterfield town centre. The buildings were extensively renovated by the University between 2014 and 2016, after being acquired by the University of Derby in 2014. The new campus opened in October 2016 Chesterfield Campus, Derby.ac.uk, 2016St Helena's Campus - University of Derby, chesterfield.co.uk, 2016New ¬£6.9 million University campus brings history and future together in Chesterfield University of Derby 21 October 2016 to be a delivery site for the College of Health and Social Care, including their nationally recognised Adult Nursing degrees and Mentoring in Practice courses, replacing existing premises in the Chesterfield Chamber of Commerce building. These courses are accredited by the Nursing and Midwifery Council. These courses continue the University's training work in collaboration with Chesterfield Royal Hospital, and the campus features a mock ward and 'clinical skills suite' with simulated patients to provide real-world experience for undergraduates. Leek The Leek campus is a delivery site for Buxton & Leek College. The campus mainly runs Further and Adult Education courses, but also runs some degree programmes validated by the University of Derby. International partnerships The University does not have any campuses abroad but instead partners with institutions around the world, which deliver and award University of Derby degrees. Current international collaborations include Botswana Accountancy College, Swiss Education Group, Mediterranean College, Raffles Design Institute, Help Academy and the Royal Malaysian Police.

Academic profile Student life The Atrium, Kedleston Road The Atrium, built in 1994, is a large concourse at the Kedleston Road site. The atrium is used regularly for university, student union and private events. Previously, the atrium has been the main venue of students' union balls. The Union of Students also provides social space and catering facilities for students within its 'Union Quarter'. The Union Quarter includes licensed bar and live entertainment venue, The Academy.http://www.udsu.co.uk/pageassets/leadership/trustees/officerreports/December- report.pdf Students' Union The Union of Students is the students union at the University of Derby and is based within the Students' Union Quarter at the Kedleston Road site. The Union of Students completed a rebrand for the start of 2017 - 2018 academic year and was previously known as UDSU - University of Derby Students' Union. Its main bar and entertainments venue, the Academy, was opened in April 2006. The venue has a capacity of 570 The Union of Students previously owned and operated a number of student venues in Derby including Lonsdale bar, The Riverside, union1 and Union2. Prior to the opening of the Academy Bar, the Students' Union operated a bar called The Union Arms at the Kedleston Road Campus, whilst the Richardson Hall (location of the new Academy bar) was used for concerts and events.

It is printed six days a week, daily except Sunday. The paper employs about 150 people and has annual revenue of 130 million Swedish kronor. Bengt Wendle is the CEO, while AnnaKarin Lith is chief editor. It is mainly distributed in the municipalities of Falkenberg and Varberg, where over 70% of the households subscribe. The paper has editorial offices in Falkenberg, Varberg, Kungsbacka and Halmstad. It is distributed as a talking magazine as well. Stampen AB bought it from Centertidningar AB in 2005. Originally published under the label Falkenbergs-Posten, it changed its name to Hallands Nyheter in 1919. History The newspaper started as Falkenbergs-Posten and was initially an advertising brochure. It was set up by a printer, Artur Lagerihn, who published the first issue on 2 October 1905. Before that, he had printed three specimen copies, starting on 13 September. The paper changed form to become a usual newspaper after just a few copies. It was then printed three times a week: Mondays; Wednesdays and Fridays. The paper had four pages. It was distributed by post on the countryside, while townspeople could either get it at specified places, or pay a bit extra and get it delivered. Falkenbergs- Posten was a liberal paper, in opposition to its competitor, the large Falkenbergs Tidning, which was conservative. Nils Bierke become joint owner on 18 December. He was the chief editor of the paper during two periods, until 1909. The paper suffered from bad finances and in 1907 it became a corporation. Several of the town's businessmen bought shares and become board members. In 1908 Artur Lagerihn got sick and Gustav Adolf Janson (usually written Gustav Ad. Janson) took over the authorization to issue the newspaper. Nils Bierke left the paper. On 4 January it started to use modern Swedish spelling. The financial problems were however still there. In 1909 it issued preference shares, that was however not enough, and the paper had to declare bankruptcy Reconstruction The paper was reconstructed by three of its former owners: A T T√∂rngren; Julius M√•nsson and A Andersson. The first copy was printed on 26 November 1909. Filip P√§rson held the post as chief editor, and would continue to do so until 1927. In November 1911, Filip P√§rson's wife, Tekla P√§rson, took over as owner together with Gustav Ad. Jansson. Filip could himself not stand as owner as he had been involved in an earlier bankruptcy. From 1912 the paper would be published at Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The reason for the change was that it fitted better with the post distribution, and the days were those on which Falkenbergs Tidning was published as well. The farmer's movement gets involved The recently formed National Farmers Union (Jordbrukarnas Riksf√∂rbund) want a newspaper in Halland. At the annual meeting on 28 May 1919 it was decided that the possibility of getting a mean of influencing the press in Halland should be investigated. As a consequence a company, owned by individuals within the farmer's movement, bought the paper. The goal was to make it a paper of the entire county. In December 1919, the paper therefore changed its name to Hallands Nyheter (News of Halland). The paper had until then been a paper of the countryside of Falkenberg Municipality. It would take considerable time before that would to start to change. In the town Falkenbergs, Tidning still ruled. A few years after the takeover, it became formally owned by the Farmers' League, a successor of the National Farmers Union. By becoming owned by the farmer's movement the paper not only got more money into the company, it also gained from the contact net of the movement to receive news. The financial situation did however continue to be worrying. They did not succeed in widening is distribution area. As of 1926 it had a circulation of 2,000. This led the Farmer's League to sell the paper back to its CEO and former owner, Gustaf Adolf Janson. Janson not only got ownership of the paper, he became the new editor in chief. A deal was struck between Janson and the farmer's movement. The movement promised to continue to support the paper by subscribing, advertising etc. if the paper continued wear their stamp. The company saw a turn for the better when the printer was commissioned to print Hall√§ndska Lantmannatidningen the same year. Although small in size it had, in the 1940s, a circulation of 20,000, hence giving the company a much needed stable source of income. The financial situation was brightened further when it was commissioned to print SLU-bladet in 1930. SLU-bladet was the membership paper of the Farmer's League's youth organisation. The paper establish itself in Varberg Starting 12 August 1930 the paper was printed by a new printer, replacing one used from the foundation. In 1931 it started printing on Mondays, hence printing four editions a week. The move was caused by a similar move taken by Falkenbergs Tidning a year earlier. Another important change occurred the same year. The paper established a new editorial office in the neighboring town of Varberg. After a tough start, it grew partly because of the local editor in chief, Axel E Blixt, a man with good connections with the farmer's movement. Pressure from the farmer's movement had been the deciding factor behind the expansion. The Hallands Nyheter, as well as the farmer's movement, had been offered to buy one of the newspapers in the town, Norra Hallands Tidning Vestkusten. Neither the paper, nor the movement, were interested. The new office did have some tough first years, as the Union of Merchants boycotted the new paper until 1937. The paper continued to grow, especially on the surrounding countryside. It has held a dominating position in Varberg since the 1970s. The paper was distributed six days a week from 1939. The paper switch from mid day to morning publication in response to the same move by Falkenbergs Tidning. The circulation increased, as of 1939 it was 7,295 copies, six years later it was 10,825. The paper bought a new printer in 1943. The purchase fueled some controversy, as it originally belonged to a Norwegian paper that had been taken over by the Nazis during the war, Bergens Aftenblad. G√∂teborgs Handels- och Sj√∂fartstidning, G√∂teborgs-Posten and Falkenbergs Tidning all hinted that they had been able to buy the printer at a too low price, as Norway was occupied by Germany. The old one was sold to Laholms tidning. A close cooperation between the papers was established, much due to the shared connection with the farmer's movement. The papers shared came to share a lot of their content with other. While Hallands Nyheter did well during the war and the years that followed, the same was not true for its competitors. Norra Hallands Tidning Vestkusten and Varbergs Posten, located in Varberg, as well as Falkenbergs Tidning, were all shut down and replaced by another conservative paper, Hallands Dagblad. That paper in turn shut down in 1959. The growth of Hallands Nyheter meant that the political profile was softened. Technical development and new owners The paper bought a clich√© machine in 1954. The machine meant that they could print much more photos, and in 1956 the paper got its first full-time employed photograph. The same year a teleprinter was installed. In 1964 the paper brought a new printer, this time from a Danish paper, N√¶stved Tidende. The printer was put into use in 1966. Hallands Nyheter was reorganised as a joint stock company in 1958. Gustav Ad. Janson continued to be the majority shareholder, while his wife and children became the owners of the remaining stocks. When Janson died in 1963, his son Gustav Janson took over as CEO, while Thure Mattsson became the chief editor. Between 1962 and 1966 (and later from 1980 and 1989) the paper had a local office in Getinge. By 1965 an office was opened in Halmstad and in 1966 another office was opened in Kungsbacka. By the late 1960s and the 1970s the paper's finances worsened. Centertidningar AB bought a majority stake in the company in 1975. Arvid Johansson took over as chief editor 1977. The paper begun with phototypesetting and direct lithography in 1977. A new printer was bought in 1981. Following the new printer the format was changed to berliner and the office was upgraded, to be able to handle the introduction of computers. Failed negotiations on a shared printer were held with Hallandsposten. Until 1982, Halland Nyheter had advertisements on its front page. The same year, the office in Varberg moved to new facilities, while a new office was opened in Fegen. In 1986 the paper bought another local printing company, ABC-tryck. The company started to print Laholms tidning in 1988. In 1989, for the first time, more than 30,000 copies of Hallands Nyheter were distributed. The owner was Stampen, which bought Centertidningar AB (including Hallands Nyheter) in 2005. Starting from 27 February 2007 the paper is printed in Halmstad in tabloid format. The paper is part of Mediebolaget V√§stkusten, MBVK, and its sister newspaper is Hallandsposten.

His political career ended in 1990 when he was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Six years later, he was convicted for accepting a bribe during his time in Congress. Early years Lukens was born at Harveysburg, Ohio. He attended schools in Harveysburg and graduated from high school in Waynesville, Ohio. He earned a bachelor's degree from The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio in 1954. After finishing college, Lukens joined the U.S. Air Force, reaching the rank of captain after six-and-a-half years of active duty. Remaining a member of the Air Force Reserve, in 1961 Lukens accepted a job as minority counsel for the Republican staff of the House Rules Committee. Political career Lukens was president of the national Young Republicans in the early 1960s. In 1966, Lukens won a seat in the United States House of Representatives, defeating Democrat James H. Pelley. He began serving in the House in 1967 (90th Congress). In 1968, Lukens won re-election, defeating Democrat Lloyd D. Miller. Lukens chose not to run again for the House seat in 1970. Instead, he made a run for Governor of Ohio. However, Lukens was defeated in the Republican primary by Roger Cloud, who went on to lose the general election to Democrat John J. Gilligan. Lukens was a supporter of California Governor Ronald Reagan's campaign for the Republican nomination for President in 1968. Lukens then was appointed to the Ohio State Senate, serving from 1971 to 1986. In 1986, incumbent U.S. Representative Tom Kindness did not stand for re-election for his seat (Kindness unsuccessfully tried to unseat incumbent U.S. Senator John Glenn). Lukens ran to replace Kindness and defeated perennial Democratic candidate John W. Griffin. Lukens started serving this term in 1987 (101st Congress). In 1988, Lukens won re-election, defeating Griffin once again. Sex scandals and resignation On February 1, 1989, an Ohio television station caught Lukens on camera at a Columbus, Ohio, McDonald's restaurant talking with Anna Coffman, the mother of Rosie Coffman, a teenage girl. During the conversation he openly discussed having sexual relations with Rosie. Soon afterward, a grand jury brought charges against him of contributing to the delinquency of a minor because of allegations that he paid Rosie $40 and gifts in exchange for sex when she was 16 years old. Further allegations had been made that the relationship with Coffman began when she was 13, but a grand jury declined to pursue further charges against Lukens beyond a single charge of \\"contributing to the delinquency of a minor\\". On June 30, 1989, a jury in the Franklin County Juvenile Court convicted Lukens of the misdemeanor crimes of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and contributing to the unruliness of a minor for paying $40 to Coffman for sex in his Columbus apartment on November 6, 1988. A friend of Coffman's, a 19-year-old, accompanied her that day, but was not directly involved. The judge set aside the conviction on the first charge but upheld the second, for which Lukens received the maximum penalty, 180 days in jail and a fine of $1,000. The judge suspended all but 30 days in jail and half the fine, and ordered Lukens to attend sex-offender programs and be tested for venereal diseases. Bond was set at $100,000, which the judge declared \\"eminently reasonable for a man with no remorse whatsoever.\\" Though Ohio's age of consent is 16, Lukens' conviction was under a misdemeanor statute that states that \\"no person shall... aid, abet, induce, cause, encourage, or contribute to a child or ward of the juvenile court (into) becoming an unruly or (delinquent) child.\\"Text from Columbus Dispatch, February 24, 1989, Page 2A. This language is still found in Ohio Revised Code, Section 2919.24. Lukens made an unsuccessful appeal to the Franklin County Court of Appeals. Of particular contention was the fact that Rosie Coffman had a considerable juvenile delinquency record (which included curfew violations, running away, and petty theft), but this record (as well as a psychiatric report) was ruled inadmissible. She lived with her mother, but was a ward of the Juvenile Court. Lukens' defense was that the juvenile record would show that Coffman was already a delinquent and not a reliable witness. The reliability of her testimony was already under attack, as there were significant testimony inconsistencies, a fact conceded by County Prosecutor Michael Miller.Dispatch, 2/24/89.\\"The appeals court discounted Tyack's [Lukens's attorney] contention that it was not possible to 'cause or contribute' to a child becoming unruly if the child was already unruly. Using an analogy, the court found that a person found guilty of polluting a river may not be the primary polluter but is still responsible for 'contributing' to the pollution.\\" Columbus Dispatch, \\"Court Upholds sex conviction in Lukens case\\", June 13, 1990, Page 1A. Refusing to resign from his seat despite the demands of the Republican leadership, Lukens lost the 1990 Republican primary to state representative John Boehner, who would later become Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. On October 23, 1990, the House Ethics Committee voted to investigate charges that Lukens had fondled and propositioned a Capitol elevator operator. Lukens resigned from Congress on October 24, 1990. In January 1991 he served nine days of the 30-day jail sentence handed down in 1989. House banking scandal In 1995, the task force investigating the House banking scandal charged him with five counts of bribery and conspiracy related to actions he took while in Congress. He was accused of accepting a bribe of $15,000. He was convicted in March 1996 after a second trial, and sentenced to 30 months in prison. Personal life and death Lukens married Toshiko Shirley Jane Davis, a model 21 years his junior, in Columbus, Ohio in June 1973. They divorced in 1983. Lukens died of cancer in Dallas, Texas in 2010 at the age of 79.

Use is only approved for up to three weeks. Effects generally begin within half an hour and last for up to six hours. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, dizziness, and sleepiness. Serious side effect may include addiction, allergic reactions, and seizures. In people with a sulfa allergy certain formulations may result in problems. Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not clear. How it works is not clear. Some of its effects are believed to occur following being converted into meprobamate. Carisoprodol was approved for medical use in the United States in 1959. Its approval in Europe was withdrawn in 2008. It is available as a generic medication. In the United States the wholesale cost is less than US$0.10 per dose. In 2017, it was the 255th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. In the United States, it is a Schedule IV controlled substance.  Medical uses  Somadril Comp. ‚Äì combination muscle relaxant medication containing carisoprodol, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and caffeine Carisoprodol is meant to be used along with rest, physical therapy and other measure to relax muscles after strains, sprains and muscle injuries. It comes in tablet format and is taken by the mouth three times a day and before bed.  Side effects  The usual dose of 350 mg is unlikely to engender prominent side effects other than somnolence, and mild to significant euphoria or dysphoria, but the euphoria is generally short-lived due to the fast metabolism of carisoprodol into meprobamate and other metabolites; the euphoria derived is, according to new research, most likely due to carisoprodol's inherent, potent anxiolytic effects that are far stronger than those produced by its primary metabolite, meprobamate, which is often misblamed for the drug-seeking associated with carisoprodol, as carisoprodol itself is responsible for the significantly more intense central nervous system effects than meprobamate alone. Carisoprodol has a unique mechanism of action, qualitatively different from that of meprobamate (Miltown). The medication is well tolerated and without adverse effects in the majority of patients for whom it is indicated. In some patients, however, and/or early in therapy, carisoprodol can have the full spectrum of sedative side effects and can impair the patient's ability to operate a firearm, motor vehicles, and other machinery of various types, especially when taken with medications containing alcohol, in which case an alternative medication would be considered. The intensity of the side effects of carisoprodol tends to lessen as therapy continues, as is the case with many other drugs. Other side effects include: dizziness, clumsiness, headache, fast heart rate, upset stomach, vomiting and skin rash. The interaction of carisoprodol with essentially all opioids, and other centrally acting analgesics, but especially codeine, those of the codeine-derived subgroup of the semisynthetic class (ethylmorphine, dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, nicocodeine, benzylmorphine, the various acetylated codeine derivatives including acetyldihydrocodeine, dihydroisocodeine, nicodicodeine and others) which allows the use of a smaller dose of the opioid to have a given effect, is useful in general and especially where skeletal muscle injury and/or spasm is a large part of the problem. The potentiation effect is also useful in other pain situations and is also especially useful with opioids of the open-chain class, such as methadone, levomethadone, ketobemidone, phenadoxone and others. In recreational drug users, deaths have resulted from carelessly combining overdoses of hydrocodone and carisoprodol. Another danger of misuse of carisoprodol and opiates is the potential to aspirate while unconscious. Meprobamate and other muscle-relaxing drugs often were subjects of misuse in the 1950s and 60s. Overdose cases were reported as early as 1957, and have been reported on several occasions since then. Carisoprodol is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys so this drug must be used with caution with patients that have impaired hepatic or renal function. Because of potential for more severe side effects, this drug is on the list to avoid for elderly people.NCQA‚Äôs HEDIS Measure: Use of High Risk Medications in the Elderly  Withdrawal  Carisoprodol, meprobamate, and related drugs such as tybamate, have the potential to produce physical dependence of the barbiturate type following periods of prolonged use. Withdrawal of the drug after extensive use may require hospitalization in medically compromised patients. In severe cases the withdrawal can mimic the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal including the potentially lethal status epilepticus. Psychological dependence has also been linked to carisoprodol use although this is much less severe than with meprobamate itself (presumably due to the slower onset of effects). Psychological dependence is more common in those who abuse carisoprodol and those who have a history of drug abuse (particularly sedatives or alcohol). It may reach clinical significance before physiological tolerance and dependence have occurred and (as with benzodiazepines) has been demonstrated to persist to varying degrees of severity for months or years after discontinuation. Discontinuation of carisoprodol, as with all GABA- ergics, can result in cognitive changes which persist for weeks, months, or rarely even years including greatly increased anxiety and depression, social withdrawal, hair-trigger agitation/aggression, chronic insomnia, new or aggravated (often illogical) phobias, reduced IQ, short term and long-term memory loss, and dozens of other sequelae. The effects, severity, and duration appear to be slightly dose-dependent but are mainly determined by the patients pattern of use (taken as prescribed, taken in bulk doses, mixed with other drugs, a combination of the above, etc.), genetic predisposition to drug abuse, and a history of substance abuse all increase the patients risk of persistent discontinuation syndrome symptoms. Treatment for physical withdrawal generally involves switching the patient to a long-acting benzodiazepine such as diazepam or clonazepam then slowly titrating them off the replacement drug completely at a rate which is both reasonably comfortable for the patient but rapid enough for the managing physician to consider the rate of progress acceptable (overly rapid dose reduction greatly increases the risk of patient non-compliance such as the abuse of illicitly obtained alternative sedatives and/or alcohol). Psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy have demonstrated moderate success in reducing the rebound anxiety which results upon carisoprodol discontinuation but only when combined with regular and active attendance to a substance abuse support group. Carisoprodol withdrawal can be life-threatening (especially in high dose users and those who attempt to quit \\"cold turkey\\"). Medical supervision is recommended, with gradual reduction of dose of carisoprodol or a substituted medication, typical of other depressant drugs.  Abuse  Combining a muscle relaxant like carisoprodol with opioids and benzodiazepines is referred to as \\"The Holy Trinity\\" as it has been reported to increase the power of the \\"high\\". Recreational users of carisoprodol usually seek its potentially heavy sedating, relaxant, and anxiolytic effects. Also, because of its potentiating effects on narcotics, it is often abused in conjunction with many opioid drugs. Also it is not detected on standard drug testing screens. On 26 March 2010 the DEA issued a Notice of Hearing on proposed rule making in respect to the placement of carisoprodol in schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act. Carisoprodol is sometimes mixed with date rape drugs. Many overdoses have resulted from recreational users combining these drugs to combine their individual effects without being aware of the enzyme-induction induced potentiation.  Overdose  As with other GABAergic drugs, combination with other GABAergic drugs, including alcohol, as well as with sedatives in general, possess a significant risk to the user in the form of overdose. Overdose symptoms are similar to those of other GABAergics including excessive sedation and unresponsiveness to stimuli, severe ataxia, amnesia, confusion, agitation, intoxication and inappropriate (potentially violent) behavior. Severe overdoses may present with respiratory depression (and subsequent pulmonary aspiration), coma, and death. Carisoprodol is not detected on all toxicology tests which may delay diagnosis of overdose. Overdose symptoms in combination with opiates are similar but are distinguished by the presentation of normal or pinpoint pupils, which are generally unresponsive to light. Carisoprodol (as with its metabolite meprobamate) is particularly dangerous in combination with alcohol. Flumazenil (the benzodiazepine antidote) is not effective in the management of carisoprodol overdose as carisoprodol acts at the barbiturate binding site. Treatment mirrors that of barbiturate overdoses and is generally supportive, including the administration of mechanical respiration and pressors as implicated (and in rare cases, bemegride). Total amnesia of the experience is not uncommon following recovery. In 2014 actress Skye McCole Bartusiak died of an overdose due to the combined effects of carisoprodol, hydrocodone and difluoroethane.  Pharmacology  Carisoprodol is a GABAergic drug . Pharmacokinetics Carisoprodol has a rapid, 30-minute onset of action, with the aforementioned effects lasting about two to six hours. It is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 oxidase isozyme CYP2C19, excreted by the kidneys and has about an eight-hour half- life. A considerable proportion of carisoprodol is metabolized to meprobamate, which is a known drug of abuse and dependence; this could account for the abuse potential of carisoprodol (meprobamate levels reach higher peak plasma levels than carisoprodol itself following administration). Meprobamate is believed to play a significant role in the effects of carisoprodol and meprobamates long half-life results in bioaccumulation following extended periods of carisoprodol administration. It is slightly soluble in water and freely soluble in ethanol, chloroform and acetone. The drug's solubility is practically independent of pH.  History  On 1 June 1959, several American pharmacologists convened at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan to discuss a new drug. The drug, originally thought to have antiseptic properties, was found to have central muscle-relaxing properties.Miller JG, ed. The pharmacology and clinical usefulness of carisoprodol. Detroit:Wayne State University; 1959. It had been developed by Frank Berger at Wallace Laboratories and was named carisoprodol. Carisoprodol was a modification of meprobamate, intended to have better muscle relaxing properties, less potential for abuse, and less risk of overdose. The substitution of one hydrogen atom with an isopropyl group on one of the carbamyl nitrogens was intended to yield a molecule with new pharmacological properties.  Usage and legal status   Norway  Reports from Norway have shown carisoprodol has abuse potential as a prodrug of meprobamate and/or potentiator of hydrocodone, oxycodone, codeine, and similar drugs. In May 2008 it was taken off the market in Norway.  European Union  In the EU, the European Medicines Agency issued a release recommending member states suspend marketing authorization for this product in the treatment of acute (not chronic) back pain. As of November 2007, carisoprodol has been taken off the market in Sweden due to problems with dependence and side effects. The agency overseeing pharmaceuticals considered other drugs used with the same indications as carisoprodol to have the same or better effects without the risks of the drug.  United States  Until 12 December 2011, when the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued the final ruling placing the substance carisoprodol into Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), carisoprodol was not a controlled substance. The placement of carisoprodol into Schedule IV was effective 11 January 2012. Carisoprodol is available generically as 350 mg and, more recently, 250 mg tablets. Compounded tablets with acetaminophen and codeine are also available.  Canada  Federally, carisoprodol is a prescription drug (Schedule I, sub-schedule F1). Provincial regulations vary.For British Columbia, see library.bcpharmacists.org/D-Legislation_Standards It is no longer readily available.

It is located over three campuses, two in Cheltenham and one in Gloucester, namely Francis Close Hall, The Park, Oxstalls and The Centre for Art and Photography being near to Francis Close Hall. The university is the recent successor of a large number of merged, name-changed and reformed institutions of further and higher education. Its history spans nearly two centuries. It originates from the merger of two distinct strands of educational provision in Gloucestershire being that provided by Local Government and that founded by the Anglican Church. The university traces its earliest Civic history to the Cheltenham Mechanics' Institute in 1834, and to the Cheltenham Training College in its Church history, established in 1847, by the Reverend Francis Close. Cheltenham and Gloucester College of Higher Education was created in 1990 from the two distinct strands. In October 2001, the college was awarded University status. The university provides almost 100 undergraduate courses and around 57 taught post-graduate courses within eight schools. A 10-year Memorandum of Understanding exists between the university, Gloucestershire College and South Gloucestershire and Stroud College to support access to higher education.

Until September 2011, Foundation Fellows played a significant role in the governance of the university. Following a review of governance by the university in 2010/11, it was agreed that Council should be responsible for appointing all its external members. Foundation Fellows are still eligible to apply to Council to become external members. 2001-present day In February 2012 Rennie Fritchie was announced as the new Chancellor succeeding Lord Carey of Clifton, the former Archbishop of Canterbury.

It is bordered by 35th Street to the east, Reservoir Road and the historic Georgetown district to the south, Whitehaven Park to the north and Glover Archbold Park to the west. The neighborhood is home to the Duke Ellington School of the Arts and the Washington International School (primary campus). History The history of Burleith can be traced back to 1886 when the Huidekoper family came into ownership of the Burleith tract of land. During their tenure as residents, they built a few buildings, but kept most of the land as woods and fields. In 1922 the Huidekeopers sold the land to Shannon and Luchs, Inc. Instead of keeping the land in its natural state like the previous owners, Shannon and Luchs decided to hire an architect to develop the area. The architect designed homes with moderate prices between $8,950-$13,500 that were targeted for middle class residents with higher than average taste.Burleith Citizens Association records, Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, The George Washington University. Burleith Citizens Association In 1925 the Burleith Citizens Association was developed to deal with civic and social issues concerning the neighborhood. Issues have included parking, noise control, traffic lights, and the relationship with neighboring Georgetown University. The Association also plans social activities, such as picnics and children events. Burleith is in Ward 2 and belongs to ANC 2E along with Georgetown and Hillandale. Hillandale To the west of Burleith is a 24-hour gated community called Hillandale; some consider this a separate neighborhood but it is technically part of Burleith.

D. Lawrence and A. G. Molland, \\"David Gregory‚Äôs inaugural lecture at Oxford\\", Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London, Vol. 25, No. 2 (Dec., 1970), pp.143-178, p. 144. ‚Äì 10 October 1708) was a Scottish mathematician and astronomer. He was professor of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, and later Savilian Professor of Astronomy at the University of Oxford, and a proponent of Isaac Newton's Principia. Biography Astronomiae physicae et geometricae elementa, 1726 The fourth of the fifteen children of David Gregorie, a doctor from Kinnairdy, Banffshire, and Jean Walker of Orchiston, David was born in Upper Kirkgate, Aberdeen. The nephew of astronomer and mathematician James Gregory, David, like his influential uncle before him, studied at Aberdeen Grammar School and Marischal College (University of Aberdeen), from 1671 to 1675. The Gregorys were Jacobites and left Scotland to escape religious discrimination. Young David visited several countries on the continent, including the Netherlands (where he began studying medicine at Leiden University) and France, and did not return to Scotland until 1683. On 28 November 1683, Gregory graduated M.A. at University of Edinburgh, and in October 1683 he became Chair of Mathematics at University of Edinburgh. He was \\"the first to openly teach the doctrines of the Principia, in a public seminary...in those days this was a daring innovation.\\"David Gregory from Significant Scots at electricscotland.com. Gregory decided to leave for England where, in 1691, he was elected Savilian Professor of Astronomy at the University of Oxford, due in large part to the influence of Isaac Newton. The same year he was elected to be a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1692, he was elected a Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. Gregory spent several days with Isaac Newton in 1694, discussing revisions for a second edition of Newton's Principia. Gregory made notes of these discussions, but the second edition of 1713 was not due to Gregory. In 1695 he published Catoptricae et dioptricae sphaericae elementa which addressed chromatic aberration and the possibility of its correction with achromatic lens. In 1705 Gregory became an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. At the Union of 1707, he was given the responsibility of re-organising the Scottish Mint. He was an uncle of philosopher Thomas Reid. Gregory and his wife, Elizabeth Oliphant, had nine children, but seven died while still children. On his death in Maidenhead, Berkshire he was buried in Maidenhead churchyard.

It has been a university since 1992, but has its origins in a series of institutions dating back to the 19th century. It has made teaching a particular focus of its activities, winning the inaugural Higher Education Academy Global Teaching Excellence Award, and achieving a Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) Gold Award, both in 2017. Its chancellor Prince Andrew, Duke of York resigned in 2019 following an interview concerned with allegations against him of sexual abuse and his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and amid student protests against him.  History  The present University of Huddersfield can trace its history back through several predecessor institutions.  An early failure (1825)  In 1825 there was an attempt to set up a Scientific and Mechanics Institution in the town. Supported by a group of donors, its patron was leading Whig and large local landowner Sir John Ramsden. Its aims were to instruct local mechanics and tradesmen in scientific principles relating to their work, through lectures and a circulation library, which by 1827 contained over 700 volumes. The financial crisis of 1825‚Äì1826 led to the failure of the institution‚Äôs bankers, and it faltered and later became part of the Huddersfield Philosophical Society, an organisation with which its rules now more closely aligned. Some 19th-century students earned qualifications as external students of the University of London.  Young Men's Mental Improvement Society (1841‚Äì1843)  The history of the university is usually traced to 1841. It was in that year that five young men who were employed by local industrialist Frederic Schwann, who had been born in Frankfurt, approached their employer for support in establishing a new subscription library and some elementary educational classes, ‚Äòto supply in some cases the deficiency of early instruction, and to procure for others the means of further improvement‚Äô. They first met in the Temperance Hotel, Cross Church Street, Huddersfield in May 1841. Classes began for the first 40 or so pupils in the room of the British School at Outcote Bank, and were taught by experienced staff from the local Collegiate Schools and businessmen like Schwann. A subscription library was founded, and classes were delivered in Reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, geography, design and French.  Huddersfield Mechanics' Institution (1844‚Äì1883)  The increase in student numbers prompted a move to Nelson's Buildings in New Street, and the renaming of the institution to more closely reflect its remit. The first Secretary, Robert Neil, was appointed in 1844, and acted not just as a Secretary but as a teacher-supervisor, influencing the formative development of the organisation. In March 1844 he organised an Soiree (tea-party) for 700 at the town's Philosophical Hall, and in May a Rural Gala for 500 at Fixby Pastures. Negotiations with the local railway company led to reduced fares into York for 300 membership to enjoy the cultural opportunities of the city. In 1846, Neil was succeeded by George Searle Phillips, who was described by historian John O'Connell as 'philosopher, propagandist and missionary' of the institution. He oversaw expansion of the curriculum, revision of the fee system to make the institution self-supporting, the visitation of absent students and the compilation of statistics of the institution's achievements. In 1850, growing attendance meant another move, to Wellington Buildings, Queen Street. At this time, a 'Preliminary Savings Bank' scheme was also introduced in the Institution, linked to the Huddersfield Banking Company, which took almost 7000 deposits during its first year of operation. Based on the Scottish system of encouraging working people to make small, regular saving deposits, it was a forerunner of the Post Office Savings Bank, founded in 1861. In 1854, after Phillips resignation, Frank Curzon took over as Secretary and remained in post until 1883. During his tenure a prize giving and distribution ceremony was introduced to reward attendance and good conduct. He not only oversaw a recruitment drive, but also the move to the first purpose built home of the institution, on Northumberland Street. The institution took possession in 1861, as student numbers passed 800 annually. The continued prosperity of the institution during the 1860s has been attributed to two main developments ‚Äì the demand for more technical and scientific education, and the introduction of an examination system by the newly formed national Department of Science and Art. The institution managed an examinations system and gave grants to science schools (often based in Mechanics' Institutions) on a 'payment by results' basis. In 1857 the Society of Arts held its first examinations outside London at Huddersfield.  Technical School and Mechanics' Institute (1883‚Äì1896)  A merger took place with the town‚Äôs Female Educational Institute in 1883, and the institution become the Technical School and Mechanics' Institute. A new building was constructed on what it today the ring road called Queensgate that cost ¬£20,000, and was funded by the subscriptions of members and philanthropic supporters. Called the Ramsden Building, after the Ramsden family who owned the land upon which the building stood, the building is still in use by the Health and Human Sciences Department of the university today. Before the building opened to students in 1884, it was used for a five-month Fine Art and Industrial Exhibition. These kinds of exhibitions, inspired by the Great Exhibition, showcased the latest in textile technology alongside copies of great masters paintings or more contemporary works.  Technical College and College of Technology (1896‚Äì1970)  In 1896, the Technical School and Mechanics' Institute became the Technical College, which changed its name in 1958 to become the College of Technology. World War I was a time of growth for the College. A Coal Tar Chemistry Department was created, funded by the government and by donations which were also used to provide research scholarships in Chemistry. More than 100 chemists worked at the College as research staff as products were created for British Dyes Ltd. During World War II, the College housed student teachers evacuated from Avery Hill College of Education, Eltham, London (now part of the University of Greenwich), and trained members of the armed forces training to be radio mechanics, engineers, fitters and clerks. Civilians also trained at the College in more basic workshop skills. One notable visitor to the college in 1964 was Dusty Springfield, who appeared at 'Sound Sixty-Four', an event organised by the Huddersfield Tech students as part of Rag Week.  Huddersfield Polytechnic (1970‚Äì1992)  It was the College of Technology which, in 1970, merged with the Oastler College of Education to become Huddersfield Polytechnic. The Oastler College had been founded in 1963, as a day training college for school teachers. Huddersfield Polytechnic was officially inaugurated by the then Education Secretary Margaret Thatcher on 23 April 1971. David Blunkett studied at Holly Bank College In 1974, a further merger took place with the Technical Teaching Training College at Holly Bank. That college had been noted in education circles for its policy of training students over the age of 25, one of whom was the future Education Secretary David Blunkett. However, after the merger, it became part of the Polytechnic's Faculty of Education, and those idiosyncrasies were gradually eroded. Teacher training remained on the Holly Bank site until the land was sold by the university in 2001. The campus precinct was redeveloped by the firm Wilson and Womersley. Awarding J. L. Womersley a Fellowship for the design, the Deputy Rector commented on the courage and vision of the plan, with the Central Services building in particular being a monument to that vision. The large brown Central Services Building, now known as the Schwann Building, a prominent feature not just of the campus but also the town of Huddersfield itself, was completed in January 1977. The brown colour was chosen so it would better fit in with the local sandstone. The building was officially opened by the Duchess of Kent. Several high-profile bands played the university's students' union during the late 1970s and early 1980s, including The Stranglers, The Jam and The Undertones. Former Prime Minister Harold Wilson returned to his hometown in 1983, the same year he stood down as an MP, to open a university building on Firth Street and to deliver a lecture. He would later have a different building named after him on the campus.  University of Huddersfield (since 1992)  The Polytechnic became the University of Huddersfield in 1992. Professor Ken Durrands was Vice-Chancellor at the time the institution achieved university status. He was later credited with having \\"transformed\\" it into \\"a thriving university\\". However, in 1994 he was forced to leave his post before the end of his contract, following a row over the removal of independently-elected representatives from the university's governing body. Sir William Taylor served as Vice-Chancellor for a year during 1994 and 1995. He had previously been the Vice-Chancellor of Hull University. He only intended to remain at Huddersfield for 12 months, on an interim basis. The next Vice-Chancellor was John Tarrant, appointed in October 1995. He served in the role until 2006, and was later Secretary General of the Association of Commonwealth Universities until his retirement in 2010. The present Vice-Chancellor, Professor Bob Cryan, took over the job in January 2007. At the time, he was the youngest Vice-Chancellor in the UK. His strategy for the university during this time has been to lead an \\"inspiring, innovative University of international renown\\". In May 2007, the university welcomed Queen Elizabeth for a visit to the campus, during which she unveiled the foundation stone for the new Creative Arts Building. The following year, the building was officially opened by the Duke of Kent. In 2013, the University of Huddersfield was named University of the Year at the Times Higher Education Awards. Accepting the award, Prof Cryan said: \\"It is a tribute to all the staff who have worked so hard to get us where we are today. We are now well established as one of the country‚Äôs innovative universities ‚Äì and the best is yet to come.\\" The archives of all the university's predecessor institutions are held in Heritage Quay, the University Archive Service based in the Schwann Building. Heritage Quay opened in 2014 and is open to the general public, allowing easier access to both students and non-students to the many collections within university's archives. It received more than ¬£1.5m in Lottery funding, and in 2016 won the Buildings That Inspire category in the Guardian's University Awards. The university now attracts students from more than 130 countries. With an annual turnover of approximately ¬£150m each year, it estimates it is worth ¬£300m annually to the local economy. The University came under scrutiny in July 2020 for the provision of training at a Bahraini centre accused of facilitating state-sponsored torture.https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/education/refugee-calls-huddersfield- university-end-teaching-centre-bahrain-amid-torture-claims-2904601  Campuses   Queensgate Campus  Queensgate Campus A view of Queensgate Campus The university's main campus, Queensgate, is south-east of Huddersfield town centre. Virtually all of the university's teaching takes place on the site. The campus is split in two by the Huddersfield Narrow Canal. It features a mixture of converted mill buildings, and purpose-built facilities. More than ¬£250 million has been invested by the university in the campus. A notable feature of the University of Huddersfield in recent years has been the amount of building work taking place on the Queensgate campus. In addition to the Creative Arts Building which opened in 2008, a new ¬£17 million Business School opened in 2010, followed by the ¬£3 million Buckley Innovation Centre in 2012, the ¬£22.5 million Student Central building in 2014, and the ¬£27.5 million Oastler Building for Law and the School of Music, Humanities and Media, in 2017. As part of the university's 175th anniversary commemorations in 2016, several of the buildings on the Queensgate campus were renamed after significant figures with connections to the Huddersfield area and the university's predecessor institutions. The distinctive brown Central Services Building was renamed the Schwann Building, after Frederic and Mary Schwann who had been inspired to create the Young Men's Mental Improvement Society in 1841. Other buildings were named for Edith Key, Joseph Priestley, the Bront√´ sisters and the university's own chancellor emeritus, Sir Patrick Stewart. In a second round of renaming in 2017, other campus buildings were named in honour of Karen Sparck Jones, Dame Caroline Haslett, Sir John Cockcroft, and Charles Sikes. The university's latest major building project, the Barbara Hepworth Building, is home to the School of Art, Design and Architecture. It was completed in summer 2019.  University Campus Oldham  University Campus Oldham (UCO), located in Oldham, Greater Manchester, opened in May 2005. It offers full and part-time courses at degree, diploma, foundation degree and postgraduate level. Since August 2012 University Campus Oldham (UCO) has been managed by Oldham College. In 2017‚Äì2018, UCO Teacher Education programmes continue to be validated by the university, and lead to a University of Huddersfield award.  University Campus Barnsley  University Campus Barnsley, located in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, opened in 2005. The campus offers facilities for subjects such as music, art and design, journalism and media production. ¬£5.5 million has been invested with the help of the Higher Education Funding Council for England, Yorkshire Forward and Objective 1. From August 2013 University Campus Barnsley (UCB) has been managed by Barnsley College. UCB programmes starting in September 2013 continue to be validated by the university, and lead to a University of Huddersfield award. Previously the Barnsley Mining and Technical College was at this site. The ‚ÄúTech‚Äù opened in 1932 when mining was at the heart of Barnsley‚Äôs economy and the College was supposedly the largest mining college in the world.  International Study Centre  The International Study Centre (ISC) at the university offers degree preparation courses for international students. The programmes are run by Study Group. The ISC is located on the university‚Äôs main Queensgate campus. Students can mix with others and also have access to the library and other specialist IT facilities.  Organisation and governance  Chancellor  The university's first two chancellors were Reginald Cross, who held the role between 1992 and 1994, and Sir Ernest Hall, who served between 1996 and 2004. Sir Patrick Stewart meeting students on the University campus in April 2017 Sir Patrick Stewart served as Chancellor for 11 years, having first been appointed in 2004. He has been a regular visitor to the campus, sometimes leading workshops with drama students, in addition to being an overseas ambassador for the university. One feature of Sir Patrick's tenure as Chancellor was his attendance at summer graduation ceremonies, and his leading of parades of graduates through the town. The first such parade took place in 2008. He has continued his association with the university as emeritus chancellor. In 2016, the building used by the university's Drama department, previously known as the Milton building, was renamed the Sir Patrick Stewart building. He returned to the campus to reopen it. =Tenure and resignation of Prince Andrew, Duke of York= Prince Andrew, Duke of York replaced actor Sir Patrick Stewart to become the University‚Äôs fourth chancellor in July 2015. He had previously served as the patron of the university since 2013. He resigned in 2019 following an interview concerned with allegations against him of child sexual abuse and his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and amid student protests against him; the student union had called for his resignation and issued a statement that the university's chancellor was \\"a man with ties to organised child sexual exploitation and assault.\\"  Senior management  The university is run by the vice-chancellor, Professor Bob Cryan. Underneath him is deputy vice-chancellor, Professor Tim Thornton, and three pro vice- chancellors. Each of the seven academic schools is led by a dean, with an eighth dean who oversees the graduate school. Other university services are run by directors. Academic profile  Academic schools  The university is organised into the following academic schools: * Applied Sciences * Art, Design and Architecture * Computing and Engineering * Education and Professional Development * Business * Human and Health Sciences * Music, Humanities and Media Research  New Business SchoolThe University has world-leading applied research groups in biomedical sciences, engineering and physical sciences, social sciences and arts and humanities. It has quadrupled its research income and its number of postgraduate researchers in recent years. In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) exercise, the University of Huddersfield achieved its best ever result. It rose to 68th in the UK Research Power league table, having been placed 97th in the 2008 REF. More University of Huddersfield academics, 262, were entered than in any previous cycle, and the proportion of world leading research submitted increased to 15%. The university also host the MIAMI facilities, a world-class laboratory addressed to materials sciences investigations and energy studies.  Royal connections  The Creative Arts Building.The University has developed a significant association with the Royal family in recent years, in particular with the appointment of The Duke of York as Patron in 2013 and later Chancellor in 2015. The university's centre for young entrepreneurs is named for the Duke, and was opened by him in 2013. It is situated on the first floor of the Buckley Innovation Centre, across Firth Street from the main campus. The Duke's former wife, Sarah, Duchess of York, was in 2016 given the title of Visiting Professor of Philanthropreneurship. Their elder daughter, Princess Beatrice, has also visited the university to meet students and view their work. The Queen visited the campus in 2007 to lay the foundation stone of the Creative Arts Building. Other royals to have visited the university in the years since include the Princess Royal, who in 2015 opened the new Student Central building, the Duke of Kent and the Duke of Gloucester. The Prince of Wales visited University Campus Barnsley in 2012. Student life  Accommodation  The Storthes Hall Park Student Village and Ashenhurst Student Houses are the university-affiliated accommodation. These residences are privately owned and operated by Digs Student, independently of the university. Storthes Hall is situated in a parkland to the south of the town with 1,386 en-suite single, double or disabled bedrooms in shared flats of six to eight students. Ashenhurst Houses are located in woodlands close to the campus and Storthes Hall Park. There are 280 single bedrooms in shared houses of six to eight students, all with shared facilities including a communal lounge and kitchen/dining area. HudLets work with halls of residences and private landlords to ensure students have access to high-quality accommodation at a fair price during their studies. Incorporated In 2014, Huddersfield Students' Union Lettings LTD (trading as HudLets) is a subsidiary of Huddersfield Students' Union.  Students' Union  Huddersfield Students' Union (HSU) represents, supports and advises students on all aspects of their time at the university. HSU is a charity based on campus, led by students for students, although they work closely with the university, it is a completely separate organisation. The Union is home to over 100 student-led Sports Clubs and Societies and 5 Student Networks helping members making change on and off campus. The Students' Union is also home to a lettings agency (HudLets), an Advice Centre and Shop. In November 2017 HSU celebrated its 90th birthday. In January 2014 HSU moved to Floor 5 of the newly purpose-built Student Central building. The building cost ¬£22.5 million and includes an 800-capacity sports hall, catering outlets, a shop, offices for the student radio station Radio Hud and magazine T'Hud, and a range of university support services including welfare and the careers centre. There was some controversy when the new building opened as it does not include a bar. Reports suggested the bar in the previous union building had been losing as much as ¬£100,000 a year, with students instead choosing to drink at home or in other nearby pubs and clubs.  Reputation and rankings  It was ranked 701+ in the 2015‚Äì16 QS World University Rankings. The university was the Entrepreneurial University of the Year at the THE awards 2012. It won the Outstanding Registry Team 2013 at the THE Leadership and Management awards 2013. The university was University of the Year at the THE awards 2013. In 2014 the university was named the Times Higher Education's (THE) Best University Workplace. The university was the New University of the Year at the Educate North Awards 2015. In 2016, the university came top among all UK universities for having qualified teaching staff. More than 90% of its academic were found to have a teaching qualification, with the next-highest institution scoring 84%.

It is connected to the Small Bitter Lake (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ≠Ÿäÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿµÿ∫ÿ±Ÿâ; transliterated: al-Buhayrah al-Murra as-Sughra), through which the canal also runs. Before the canal was built (1869), the site was a dry salt valley or basin. Madl, Pierre (1999). Essay about the phenomenon of Lessepsian Migration , Colloquial Meeting of Marine Biology I, Salzburg, April 1999 (revised in Nov. 2001). References are made to the Great Bitter Lake in the ancient Pyramid Texts. Ships traveling through the Suez Canal use the Great Bitter Lake as a \\"passing lane\\", where they can change their position in line or turn around. Salinity When the Suez Canal was closed for eight years, beginning during the Six-Day War in 1967, the salinity of the lake increased substantially. The salinity of the lake depends on how much seawater flows into it from the Red and the Mediterranean seas. Even when the canal is open, the Great Bitter Lake has a salinity level \\"more than twice\\" the level of the sea. While this makes it difficult for plant life to exist there, many species (of crabs, for example) migrate from the Red Sea through the area. As the canal has no locks, sea water flows freely into the lake from the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. In general, north of the lakes the current reverses seasonally, being north-going in winter and south-going in summer. South of the lakes, the current is tidal, reversing with the tides in the Red Sea. Fish can migrate, generally in a northerly direction, through the canal and lakes in what is known as a Lessepsian migration. This means that some Red Sea species have come to colonize the eastern Mediterranean. Quincy Agreement On 14 February 1945, in the last year of World War II, Great Bitter Lake was the site of the Quincy Agreement. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, having flown directly from the Yalta Conference with Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin, met on board the naval cruiser USS Quincy with Saudi Arabia's King Abdulaziz. President Roosevelt's interpreter was U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Bill Eddy, who recorded the men's conversation in his book FDR Meets Ibn Saud. The meeting is the subject of a BBC documentary by Adam Curtis, entitled Bitter Lake (2015). Yellow Fleet During the Six-Day War in 1967, the canal was closed. Egypt kept it closed until 1975, trapping 15 ships in the lake. These ships became known as the \\"Yellow Fleet\\", because of the desert sands which soon covered their decks. The crews of the ships would eventually organize, share resources, and later set up their own post office and stamp. Two German-flagged ships eventually sailed out of the canal on their own power. Stranded cargo included various perishables (such as eggs and fruit), T-shirts, and a load of toys destined for Woolworth's.

It has campuses in the city centre and Headingley. The university‚Äôs origins can be traced to 1824, with the foundation of the Leeds Mechanics Institute. Leeds Polytechnic was formed in 1970, and was part of the Leeds Local Education Authority until it became an independent Higher Education Corporation on 1 April 1989. In 1992, the institution gained university status. The current name was adopted in September 2014. The annual income of the institution for 2016-17 was ¬£221.4 million of which ¬£3.4 million was from grants and contracts, with an expenditure of ¬£217.1 million.  History  Leeds Mechanics' Institute building, Woodhouse The university traces its roots to 1824 when the Leeds Mechanics Institute was founded. The institute later became the Leeds Institute of Science, Art and Literature and in 1927 was renamed Leeds College of Technology. In 1970, the college merged with Leeds College of Commerce (founded 1845), part of Leeds College of Art (f. 1846) and Yorkshire College of Education and Home Economics (f. 1874), forming Leeds Polytechnic. In 1976, James Graham College and the City of Leeds College of Education (f. 1907 as part of City of Leeds Training College) joined Leeds Polytechnic. In 1987, the Polytechnic became one of the founding members of the Northern Consortium. After the Further and Higher Education Act came into effect in 1992, the Polytechnic became Leeds Metropolitan University, with the right to award its own degrees. In 1998, the university merged with Harrogate College, establishing the Harrogate campus until 2008 when the college left the university and merged with Hull College. In 2008 the university petitioned the Privy Council to be renamed \\"Leeds Carnegie University\\"; however, this was eventually dropped. In 2009 a partnership with the University of North Florida was established to begin a student and faculty exchange programme. The university also has an agreement with Bradford College by which it validates degrees for the college. Name change In 2013, it was announced that the Board of Governors had applied to the Privy Council to change the name to Leeds Beckett University, after one of the university's founding colleges, Beckett Park, which in turn was named after Ernest Beckett, 2nd Baron Grimthorpe. The proposed change resulted in a backlash among students. The Privy Council approved Leeds Metropolitan University's application to change its name to Leeds Beckett University in November 2013. The name change took place in September 2014. The former logos of Leeds Metropolitan University were retained after the name changed, being adapted to fit the new name. Despite the name change, the university is often referred to as \\"the Met\\" or \\"the Poly\\" by local people. The Carnegie name is less commonly used by the university now but is still retained for the sporting faculty.  Campuses   City Campus  This comprises a number of locations on the northern side of Leeds city centre, largely between the Inner Ring Road and the University of Leeds campus. In addition to the former Polytechnic site, several other buildings have recently been acquired. These include: Old Broadcasting House, the former home of the BBC in Leeds; Electric Press, a building on Millennium Square; and Old School Board, the birthplace of school education in Leeds. The latest additions for the 2008/09-year were the Rose Bowl, the new home of the Leeds Business School, opposite the Civic Hall and designed to reflect the facade of the Civic Hall and the Broadcasting Place complex, including Broadcasting Tower, a new set of buildings which fits in with the red stone brick buildings famous in Leeds and which provides teaching space for the Faculty of Arts, Environment and Technology and the Faculty of Art, Architecture and Design, as well as student accommodation. Three buildings on the site have been disposed of since becoming a university, the Brunswick building was sold and in 2008 demolished; it is now the site of the Leeds Arena. A further tower block has been sold and is now a Premier Inn. More recently, Cloth Hall Court has also been disposed of and sold to their neighbour, The University of Leeds. The remaining largely 1960s buildings of the former polytechnic were reclad in the early 2010s. New high-rise student accommodation has been built around the City Campus and includes Opal Tower and the Sky Plaza. These are now the tallest buildings in the Northern half of the city centre.  Headingley Campus  A campus sited in Beckett Park, Headingley, the campus is connected to the city centre by Headingley railway station which is a short walk from the campus. Bus routes on Otley Road and Kirkstall Lane are also close by. Beckett Park Campus =James Graham Building= The James Graham building seen across The Acre on the Beckett Park campus. The main building was constructed in 1912 as the Education Block for the City of Leeds Training College and is a Grade II Listed Building of red brick, gritstone ashlar dressings, slate and a lead roof. It is of classical Neo-Georgian style by G. W. Atkinson, the winner of an architectural competition. The main entrance is reached by a flight of stairs to a recessed portico framed by 4 Corinthian pillars and a pediment above, and the building as a whole was constructed around two internal quadrangles. However, these have now been filled in to create large lecture theatres.Lori Beckett (2007) City of Leeds Training College, Continuity and Change 1907-2007 Leeds Metropolitan University Note: there are two books with this number and Amazon gives the other.

He also named all of the Halls, apart from Priestley, which was chosen by a committee. =The Halls= Bronte Hall The James Graham Building stands in front of a large lawn called the Acre. On the two sides are buildings of the same date and materials, which were originally halls of residence for the college students but are now teaching facilities. These are also Grade II Listed buildings. Bronte Hall was designed by G. W. Atkinson. The others were designed by the runners up in the architecture competition, using Bronte as a template but allowing individual touches. The five halls on the East were for women, the two halls on the West were for men (women being more numerous as teachers). =The Grange= The Grange This is a Grade II* listed building of ashlar gritstone with blue slate roofs and a lead-covered dome. The earliest portions date from 1752, but there were major alterations in about 1834 and 1858 by the Beckett family, who ultimately sold it and the surrounding estate to Leeds Corporation to build the college and make a public park. It was used by the college as a hall of residence for men, but the university converted it into IT offices and service areas. Carnegie Campus Carnegie Pavilion In 2006, the campus extended beyond the confines of Beckett Park to include the Carnegie Stand at the Headingley Stadium. This dual-purpose stand accommodates more than 4,500 spectators, and also provides teaching rooms and a hall. After bulldozing R. W. Rich Hall, a student hall of residence built in the 1960s, the Carnegie Village, was opened in August 2009, providing on-campus accommodation for 479 students.  Accommodation  Sugarwell Court residences in Meanwood. The university provides 4,500 bedrooms in a variety of locations and all first year undergraduates are guaranteed a place in university accommodation, so long as Leeds Beckett University is the student's first choice university. Opal 3 student residences in Leeds city centre are shared with the University of Leeds. Carnegie Village was newly built in September 2010 and provides Passivhaus standard townhouses and apartments at Headingley Campus. The largest hall is Kirkstall Brewery on Broad Lane which has places for over 1,000 students and is about from the Headingley campus. As its name suggests, it is a former brewery property, but is mostly modern blocks. The second largest is Sugarwell Court, in Meanwood, which is about from the City campus, and accommodates 388 students. This is also a converted industrial site. Two of the most popular accommodation buildings are next to each other in Burley near The Leeds Studios and from City Campus. Formerly owned by Opal Property Group and now owned by Greystar Real Estate Partners, they are Marsden House (previously Opal 1) and Leeds Student Village (previously Opal 2). Accommodation types not owned by the university vary. Across North Leeds there are many sites which are primarily low-rise buildings, often converted from a former industrial use. The growing number of sites around the city centre has led to the building of new highrise complexes, these include CLV Leeds (previously Opal 3), The Skyplaza and Broadcasting Tower. Organisation and governance Peter Slee joined the university as Vice-Chancellor in September 2015, succeeding Susan Price, who had been in post since January 2010. The current Deputy Vice-Chancellors are Paul Smith (Strategic Development), Andrew Slade (Research & Enterprise) and Phil Cardew (Academic).

Reputation and rankings In November 2006, the university won the award for \\"outstanding contribution to the local community\\" at the annual higher education awards ceremony hosted by The Times Higher Education Supplement. It also came second in the main category, \\"the university of the Year\\", which was won by the University of Nottingham. In this category, the university was highly commended for its \\"low-charging, high impact\\" strategy. In June 2007, the university was recognised for its environmentally friendly attitude by being ranked number one in the UK in the Green League 2007: a ranking of sustainability in the higher education sector, compiled by People & Planet. In June 2013, Leeds Beckett University became only the third university in the UK to achieve the Customer Service Excellence standard, a Government benchmark awarded to public sector bodies who demonstrate a commitment to driving customer-focused change within their organisation. In 2013, the University obtained the Gold Investors in People standard, one of only a handful of higher education institutions to do so. In January 2015, Leeds Beckett University entered Stonewall‚Äôs nationally recognised league table of gay- friendly employers at number 51 in the rankings.  Leeds Beckett University repository  In common with many institutions in the UK, and globally, the university maintains an open access repository that comprises an open access research archive and an OER repository: A store of open educational resources produced at Leeds Beckett that are freely available for reuse under a Creative Commons (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 UK: England & Wales) licence.  Partnerships  The university has established a number of sporting and cultural partnerships, both in the UK and overseas. Simon Lee embarked on a controversial programme of partnerships with external bodies during his time as vice-chancellor, which were dubbed as \\"rubbing shoulders\\" after the university took a majority stake in the Leeds Tykes rugby club, renaming it Leeds Carnegie. It was subsequently revealed that the club signed Waisale Serevi after he had been paid for other work at the university. The university sold its stake in April 2009. The university spent large sums on other partnerships, including ¬£423,000 to the Northern Ballet Theatre and ¬£283,000 on the Irish Football Association. In April 2014, the Quality Assurance Agency confirmed the quality and standards of provision at Leeds Beckett University. In October 2009, the Quality Assurance Agency gave the university a \\"limited confidence\\" rating, due to concerns over maintenance of academic standards. In 2009 Simon Lee resigned following a series of controversies over the university's fees strategy, allegations of bullying and foreign travel for his wife paid for by the university. The chancellor, Brendan Foster, also resigned less than a month later. The controversies that led to these resignations formed part of the edition of 29 July 2010 of the BBC Radio 4 documentary \\"Face the Facts\\".BBC. University Waste. Face the Facts. 29 July 2010  Sporting  * Leeds Rugby ‚Äî Leeds Rhinos and Leeds Carnegie * Yorkshire County Cricket Club * In January 2007, the university became the primary sponsor for Rugby Football League's main knock-out cup competition, the Challenge Cup. This is the first partnership of this kind between the governing body of a sport in England and a university * In May of the same year, the university purchased a 51% stake in the Leeds Tykes rugby union club. The name of the club was changed to Leeds Carnegie to fit with Carnegie College The university subsequently divested itself of that stake * Carnegie have also sponsored the last three Rugby League World Club Challenge matches. This is an annual match between the domestic champions of the Super League and the Australasian NRL. Incidentally all three of the matches sponsored by Carnegie have been won by the European team. * Leeds Carnegie was a brand name used by several sports teams associated with the Carnegie School of Physical Education, now part of Leeds Beckett University.  Cultural  * Royal Armouries * West Yorkshire Playhouse  Students' Union  Leeds Beckett Students' Union is the representative body for students and is affiliated to the National Union of Students. In 2012, it was voted the second best Students' Union in the city of Leeds and 39th nationally. In 2016 it was voted 6th best SU in the country. The union on the City Campus has a Student Advice Service and a bar The City Bar which contains two live music venues called The Stage and Stage 2. The Headingley campus also has its own bar called The Hive. Athletic Union The Athletic Union is separate to the Students' Union but maintains historically close links and holds three seats on the Student Council. Leeds Beckett regularly features well in the fixtures of university sports in the UK. Varsity fixtures between Leeds Beckett and Leeds University prove to be highly popular and competitive each year.

The University has origins that trace back to 1861, and obtained university status in 1992 and its present name and structure in 2001. Lincoln's main campus is adjacent to Brayford Pool - a site of urban regeneration in the city since the 1990s. Satellite campuses are located in Riseholme, Lincolnshire - home to the Lincoln Institute for Agri-food Technology, and an additional campus at Holbeach which houses the facilities of the National Centre for Food Manufacturing (NCFM). Graduation ceremonies take place every year at the medieval Lincoln Cathedral. History Development The University of Lincoln developed from a number of educational institutions in Hull including the Hull School of Art (1861), the Hull Technical Institute (1893), the Roman Catholic teacher-training Endsleigh College (1905), the Hull Central College of Commerce (1930), and Kingston upon Hull College of Education (1913). These institutions merged in 1976 to form Hull College of Higher Education, with a change of name to Humberside College of Higher Education in 1983 when it absorbed several courses in fishing, food and manufacturing based in Grimsby. 1990 onwards In 1992 it was one of the many institutions in the UK to become full universities as the University of Humberside. The University of Humberside developed a new campus to the south west of Lincoln city centre, overlooking the Brayford Pool. The university was renamed the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside in January 1996, taking in its first 500 Lincoln students in September 1996. 21st century Looking towards the University of Lincoln across the Brayford Pool With another change of name to the University of Lincoln in October 2001, a new campus was built in Lincoln. The university moved its main campus from Hull to Lincoln in 2002. Queen Elizabeth II opened the university's main campus in Lincoln, the first new city centre campus to be built in the UK for decades. More than ¬£150 million has been invested in the Brayford Pool campus, transforming a city centre brownfield site, revitalising the area and attracting investment from the retail, leisure and property sectors. Economists estimate that the university has created at least 3,000 new jobs within Lincoln and that it generates more than ¬£250 million every year for the local economy ‚Äì doubling previous local economic growth rates.\\" The consolidation involved the University of Lincoln acquiring Leicester-based De Montfort University's schools in Lincolnshire: the Lincoln School of Art and Design in uphill Lincoln, and the Lincolnshire School of Agriculture's sites at Riseholme, Caythorpe and Holbeach. Caythorpe was later closed permanently and its activities moved to Riseholme. Courses held in Grimsby were also moved to Lincoln around this time. In 2012 all Further Education provision was transferred from Riseholme College to Bishop Burton College. Bishop Burton College are now responsible for the Riseholme College to the north of the city. Throughout the late-1990s, the university's sites in Hull were considerably scaled down as the focus shifted towards Lincoln. In 2001 this process was taken a step further when the decision was made to move the administrative headquarters and management to Lincoln and to sell the Cottingham Road campus in Hull, the former main campus, to its neighbour, the University of Hull; the site is now the home of the Hull York Medical School. Until 2012 the university maintained a smaller campus, the Derek Crothall Building, in Hull city centre. A smaller campus and student halls on Beverley Road, Hull, were also sold for redevelopment. On 28 October 2004, following its redevelopment as a specialist food science technology park, the National Centre for Food Manufacturing at Holbeach was reopened by John Hayes, the Member of Parliament for South Holland and the Deepings.  Organisation and administration   Colleges and Departments  The University of Lincoln is structured as a College-based system with each college led by a Pro Vice Chancellor. There are four colleges of study, each comprising schools, institutes and research centres. *College of Science **School of Chemistry **School of Computer Science **School of Engineering **School of Life Sciences **School of Geography **School of Mathematics & Physics **Lincoln Medical School **School of Pharmacy **National Centre for Food Manufacturing **Lincoln Institute for Agri-food Technology *College of Arts **School of Architecture & Design **School of English & Journalism **School of Film & Media **School of Fine & Performing Arts **School of History & Heritage *College of Social Science **School of Education **School of Health & Social Care **Lincoln Law School **School of Psychology **School of Social & Political Sciences **School of Sport & Exercise Science *Lincoln International Business School (LIBS)  College of Science  The School of Engineering became the first engineering school to be created in the UK for more than 20 years, opening in 2011 in collaboration with Siemens. The building, designed by London Architects Allies and Morrison is the result of a long-standing collaborative effort between the University of Lincoln and Siemens Industrial Turbo-machinery Lincoln. Siemens have co-located their product training facility in custom designed locations within the build. The School of Mathematics and Physics was opened on 1 September 2014 and officially inaugurated on 1 September 2016 by Professor Efim Zelmanov. Since the beginning of the 2017/18 academic year, the school now shares the new Sir Isaac Newton Building with the School of Computer Science and the School of Engineering.  College of Art  The College of Arts undertakes research and has a range of undergraduate and postgraduate degrees available. The College is also home to Siren Radio, a community radio station based at the University which broadcasts to the city of Lincoln on 107.3 FM and online. The School of Film & Media has earned a strong reputation in league tables for its BA and MA Media Production degrees. The Lincoln Sound Theatre was opened in 2010 by Visiting Professor Trevor Dann. Lincoln is home to the largest centre for conservation and restoration study in the UK. Lincoln Conservation, the University's conservation and material analysis consultancy undertakes projects with clients including the Historic Royal Palaces and the Victoria and Albert Museum.  College of Social Science  The College of Social Science includes the School of Health and Social Care which moved into the Sarah Swift Building in July 2017. The School teaches a variety of professionally accredited course in Nursing and Social Work. The School of Psychology is housed in the purpose-built Sarah Swift Building, also shared with the School of Health and Social Care. There are a range of dedicated facilities for these fields, comprising psychology laboratories and a mock hospital ward for learning and teaching.  Lincoln International Business School  The Lincoln International Business School (LIBS) is based in the David Chiddick Building and offers undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral level programmes and is notable for its cross-functional approach to business education and diverse methods of delivery. LIBS also offers distance learning and executive education programmes aimed at the working professional.  Governance  Vice-Chancellor The founding Vice-Chancellor was Roger King. David Chiddick was Vice-Chancellor when the University was renamed to the University of Lincoln. Chiddick's name is honoured in the name of the David Chiddick Building. Vice-Chancellor, Mary Stuart, was appointed in 2009. The Vice-Chancellor is supported by five Deputy Vice-Chancellors. Chancellor The University's second Chancellor since its title change in 2001, Victor Adebowale, Baron Adebowale, was installed in 2008. Previous chancellors have included Harry Hooper and Dame Elizabeth Esteve-Coll.  Academic profile  Reputation and rankings The University of Lincoln is ranked 43rd in the UK by the Times, 42nd by Complete, and 17th by the Guardian in the 2020 rankings, its highest rankings to date. In 2017, the University of Lincoln ranked 8 in Agriculture & Forestry, and 2nd in Business & Economics in The Complete University Guide rankings. More than half of its submitted research rated as internationally excellent or world-leading in the UK's last nationwide assessment of university research standards, the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF 2014). It was awarded gold in the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF 2017). In 2020, the University of Lincoln was named Modern University of the Year in The Times and Sunday Times Good University 2021, being the highest-ranked multi-faculty modern university in the UK, climbing to 45th (out of 135), its highest ever position in the guide. In the same year including it was named one of the world's greatest young universities in the Times Higher Education Young University Rankings, placing 14th in the UK for overall student satisfaction of the 129 mainstream universities in the National Student Survey 2020, and scoring a five-star rating in the QS Stars ratings system of global universities. Identity The University of Lincoln's official logo from 2001 to 2012 was the head of Minerva, the Ancient Roman goddess of wisdom and knowledge. From July 2012 the logo was changed to incorporate the university's coat of arms, which features swans, fleur de lys and textbooks.  Campus facilities  Library Library, University of Lincoln Located in the Great Central Warehouse (GCW) building, a renovated former industrial railway goods warehouse, the Library was opened in December 2004 on the Brayford campus. In total, the University library houses over 300,000 books, journals, and other articles of reference. The GCW was constructed in 1907 by the Great Central Railway. It spent the second half of the twentieth century as a builder's warehouse before falling into disrepair in 1998. It was converted into a library (designed by the university's in-house team of architects) and was formally opened in 2004 by the Chief Executive of the UK's Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education. In 2005, the conversion won gold and silver for conservation and regeneration at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Regional Awards in Leicester. It has also gained awards from the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). Live music Constructed in 1874 by the Manchester, Sheffield & Lincolnshire Railway, The Engine Shed was the only surviving, four-track, dead-end railway building in Lincolnshire. Refitted as an entertainment venue and opened in September 2006, the Engine Shed is now the region's largest live music venue. The venue consists The Engine Shed, The Platform and Tower Bar, which combined can accommodate up to 2,000 people on any given night. As of 2014, the university transferred the operation of The Engine Shed to the Students' Union. Lincoln Performing Arts Centre Lincoln Performing Arts Centre The Lincoln Performing Arts Centre (LPAC) houses a 450-seat multipurpose auditorium designed for live arts performances, conferences, and film screenings. The theatre's programme of events is designed to complement, rather than compete with, those of its neighbouring venues.  Lincoln Science and Innovation Park  The Lincoln Science and Innovation Park is a large redevelopment south of the main university campus. The area will comprise university facilities, including laboratories, as well as space for industry partners to develop new offices and research facilities. The Science and Innovation Park is being developed in partnership with the Lincolnshire Co-operative. Sports Centre Facilities include a double sports hall, four squash courts, synthetic pitches, a fitness suite, a dance studio, eight badminton and short tennis courts, two basketball courts, two volleyball courts, two netball courts, two five-a-side football pitches and a seven-a-side football pitch. This also where the School of Sport And Exercise Science is located with the majority of their facilities being located in this building. Student life According to the university, more than a 100 different nationalities are represented among the student population on the Brayford Pool campus. Based on the available academic year data, the total student population was undergraduates and postgraduates. University of Lincoln Students' Union The University of Lincoln Students' Union, dates back to the formation of the university. In 2007, the Students' Union was reconstituted as a company limited by guarantee, and registered as a charity, introducing a more conventional governance structure for students' unions. The Students' Union supports and represents the students of the University of Lincoln, sabbatical officers are elected by the student body and supported by the staff. A number of sports teams operate in the national BUCS' leagues competing nationally against other institutions. The Students' Union were awarded NUS (National Union of Students) Higher Education Students' Union of the Year 2014/15 at the annual awards ceremony. In 2014, ownership of the on campus pub 'The Shed' was transferred to the Students' Union following the acquisition by the university from Greene King, this was later renamed to The Swan. Later this year, the operation of The Engine Shed was transferred to the Students' Union. In 2015, the Students' Union was awarded Best Bar None Gold and named second in the Best Bar None Safest Venue category. In 2016, following a student referendum,https://lincolnsu.com/news/article/nus- referendum the Students' Union voted to disaffiliate from the NUS following dissatisfaction with the organisation following the controversial 2016 NUS Conference. The decision was taken to formally exit the NUS in December, but a second referendum was held after a number of approaches from students who opposed the first vote. The re-run resulted in 1,302 students voting to remain part of the NUS, with just 437 backing disaffiliation.https://www.thejc.com/lincoln-students-overturn-vote-to-split- from-nus-1.53911 In 2019, the union opted to disaffiliate with the NUShttps://lincolnsu.com/news/article/nusupdate after consulting with students through All Student Member meetings in 2018 and 2019. However, this caused backlash across the student body, resulting in a referendum being held to leave the NUS. The results of this referendumhttps://lincolnsu.com/news/article/referendumresult were to disaffiliate from the NUS on 1 January 2020, a total of 2614 (15.7%) students turned out to vote with 996 voting to remain, 1,539 voting to leave, and 79 abstaining.  Student accommodation  In Lincoln, there are many accommodation options for students. The university owns and operates the Student Village including the Lincoln Courts and Cygnet Wharf; a waterfront complex situated on the Brayford Pool Campus. In Lincoln Courts, there are 17 blocks of self-catering apartments, each apartment housing five to eight students and Cygnet Wharf, 3 building with flats of 10‚Äì12 residents.

She was of Polish heritage and her career at the DuPont company spanned more than 40 years. She discovered the first of a family of synthetic fibers of exceptional strength and stiffness: poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide.Wholly Aromatic Carbocyclic Polycarbonamide Fiber. Original Kevlar patent awarded in 1974 to Stephanie Kwolek. For her discovery, Kwolek was awarded the DuPont company's Lavoisier Medal for outstanding technical achievement. As of August 2019, she was the only female employee to have received that honor.Dan Samorodnitsky, \\"You Can Thank Chemist Stephanie Kwolek for Bulletproof Vests and Yoga Pants,\\" Smithsonian, August 21, 2019. In 1995 she became the fourth woman to be added to the National Inventors Hall of Fame. Kwolek won numerous awards for her work in polymer chemistry, including the National Medal of Technology, the IRI Achievement Award and the Perkin Medal. Early life and education Kwolek was born to Polish immigrant parents in the Pittsburgh suburb of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, in 1923. Her father, John Kwolek (), died when she was ten years old. He was a naturalist by avocation, and Kwolek spent hours with him, as a child, exploring the natural world. She attributed her interest in science to him and an interest in fashion design to her mother, Nellie (Zajdel) Kwolek, who worked as a seamstress. In 1946, Stephanie earned a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in chemistry from Margaret Morrison Carnegie College of Carnegie Mellon University. She had planned to become a doctor and hoped she could earn enough money from a temporary job in a chemistry-related field to attend medical school. DuPont career William Hale Charch, a future mentor, offered Kwolek a position at DuPont's Buffalo, New York, facility in 1946. This vacancy was due to men being in the military overseas. Kwolek only intended to work for DuPont temporarily, to raise money to study. When she found the work interesting, she decided to stay and moved to Wilmington, Delaware, in 1950 with DuPont. In 1959, she won a publication award from the American Chemical Society (ACS), the first of many awards. The paper, The Nylon Rope Trick, demonstrated a way of producing nylon in a beaker at room temperature. It is still a common classroom experiment, and the process was extended to high molecular weight polyamides. In 1985, Kwolek and coworkers patented a method for preparing PBO and PBT polymers. Kevlar While working for DuPont, Kwolek invented Kevlar. In 1964, in anticipation of a gasoline shortage, her group began searching for a lightweight yet strong fiber to replace the steel used in tires. The polymers she had been working with at the time, poly-p-phenylene terephthalate and polybenzamide, formed liquid crystal while in solution that at the time had to be melt-spun at over , which produced weaker and less stiff fibers. A unique technique in her new projects and the melt-condensation polymerization process was to reduce those temperatures to between . As she later explained in a 1993 speech: > The solution was unusually (low viscosity), turbid, stir-opalescent and > buttermilk in appearance. Conventional polymer solutions are usually clear > or translucent and have the viscosity of molasses, more or less. The > solution that I prepared looked like a dispersion but was totally filterable > through a fine pore filter. This was a liquid crystalline solution, but I > did not know it at the time. This sort of cloudy solution usually was thrown away. However, Kwolek persuaded technician Charles Smullen, who ran the spinneret, to test her solution. She was amazed to find that the new fiber would not break when nylon typically would. Not only was it stronger than nylon, Kevlar was five times stronger than steel by weight. Both her supervisor and the laboratory director understood the significance of her discovery, and a new field of polymer chemistry quickly arose. By 1971, modern Kevlar was introduced. Kwolek learned that the fibers could be made even stronger by heat-treating them. The polymer molecules, shaped like rods or matchsticks, are highly oriented, which gives Kevlar its extraordinary strength. Kwolek continued research of thermotropic Kevlar derivatives containing aliphatic and chlorine groups. Applications of Kevlar Kwolek was not very involved in developing practical applications of Kevlar. Once senior DuPont managers were informed of the discovery, they immediately assigned a whole group to work on different aspects,\\" she said. Still, Kwolek continued chemistry investigations of Kevlar derivatives for DuPont. She also did not profit from DuPont's products, as she signed over the Kevlar patent to the company. Kevlar is used as a material in more than 200 applications, including tennis rackets, skis, parachute lines, boats, airplanes, ropes, cables, and bullet-proof vests. It has been used for car tires, fire fighter boots, hockey sticks, cut-resistant gloves and armored cars. It has also been used for protective building materials like bomb-proof materials, hurricane safe rooms, and bridge reinforcements. During the week of Kwolek's death, the one millionth bullet-resistant vest made with Kevlar was sold. Kevlar is also used to build cellular telephones; Motorola's Droid RAZR has a Kevlar unibody.  Awards and honors  For her discovery of Kevlar, Kwolek was awarded the DuPont company's Lavoisier Medal for outstanding technical achievement in 1995, as a \\"Persistent experimentalist and role model whose discovery of liquid crystalline polyamides led to Kevlar aramid fibers.\\" At the time of her death in 2014, she was still the only female employee to receive that honor. Her discovery generated several billion dollars of revenue for DuPont, being her employer at the time, but she never benefited directly from it financially. In 1980, Kwolek received the Chemical Pioneer Award from the American Institute of Chemists, and an Award for Creative Invention from the American Chemical Society. In 1995, Kwolek was added to the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1996, she received the National Medal of Technology and the IRI Achievement Award. In 1997, she received the Perkin Medal from the American Chemical Society. In 2003, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. She has been awarded honorary degrees by Carnegie Mellon University (2001), Worcester Polytechnic Institute (1981) and Clarkson University (1997). Royal Society of Chemistry - Stephanie L Kwolek Award (2014) The Royal Society of Chemistry grants a biennial 'Stephanie L Kwolek Award', \\"to recognise exceptional contributions to the area of materials chemistry from a scientist working outside the UK\\". Kwolek is featured as one of the Royal Society of Chemistry 175 Faces of Chemistry. The Star Trek E-book novella Starfleet Corps of Engineers #30: Ishtar Rising references a shuttlecraft named Kwolek. Retirement In 1986, Kwolek retired as a research associate for DuPont. Toward the end of her life, she consulted for DuPont, and served on both the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences. During her 40 years as a research scientist, she filed and received either 17 or 28 patents. She often tutored students in chemistry. She also devised and wrote about numerous classroom demonstrations that are still used in schools today, such as the Nylon Rope Trick. Kwolek died at the age of 90 on June 18, 2014.

The popularization of the type dates to the early 20th century, when Neanderthal Man was influentially described as \\"simian\\" or ape-like by Marcellin Boule and Arthur Keith. While knowledge of human evolution in the Pleistocene has become much more detailed, the stock character has not disappeared, even though it anachronistically conflates characteristics of archaic humans and early modern humans.

Anachronistically, they are simultaneously shown armed with rocks or cattle bone clubs that are also adorned with rocks, unintelligent, and aggressive. Popular culture also frequently represents cavemen as living with or alongside dinosaurs, even though non-avian dinosaurs became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, 66 million years before the emergence of the Homo sapiens species. The image of them living in caves arises from the fact that caves are where the preponderance of artifacts have been found from European Stone Age cultures, although this most likely reflects the degree of preservation that caves provide over the millennia rather than an indication of their typical form of shelter. Until the last glacial period, the great majority of hominins did not live in caves, being nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes living in a variety of temporary structures, such as tentsJerry D. Moore, \\"The Prehistory of Home\\", University of California Press, 2012 and wooden huts (e.g. at Ohalo). A few genuine cave dwellings did exist, however, such as at Mount Carmel in Israel. Stereotypical cavemen have traditionally been depicted wearing smock-like garments made of animal skin and held up by a shoulder strap on one side, and carrying large clubs approximately conical in shape. They often have grunt-like names, such as Ugg and Zog. History Cave family at a meal, illustration by unknown artist for The Cave Boy of the Age of Stone (1907) Caveman-like heraldic \\"wild men\\" were found in European and African iconography for hundreds of years. During the Middle Ages, these creatures were generally depicted in art and literature as bearded and covered in hair, and often wielding clubs and dwelling in caves. While wild men were always depicted as living outside of civilization, there was an ongoing debate as to whether they were human or animal. In Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World (1912), ape-men are depicted in a fight with modern humans. Edgar Rice Burroughs adapted this idea for The Land That Time Forgot (1918). A genre of caveman movies emerged, typified by D. W. Griffith's Man's Genesis (1912); they inspired Charles Chaplin's satiric take,Stills from Man's Genesis and His Prehistoric Past show that Chaplin still has his bowler hat. in His Prehistoric Past (1914) as well as Brute Force (1914), The Cave Man (1912), and later Cave Man (1934). From the descriptions, Griffith's characters cannot talk, and use sticks and stones for weapons, while the hero of Cave Man is a Tarzanesque figure who fights dinosaurs. Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels is a classic animated comedy depicting cavemen as totally hairy with a club. D. W. Griffith's Brute Force, a silent film released in 1914, represents one of the earliest portrayals of cavemen and dinosaurs together, with its depiction of a Ceratosaurus. The film reinforced the incorrect notion that non-avian dinosaurs co-existed with prehistoric man. The anachronistic combination of cavemen with dinosaurs eventually became a clich√©, and has often been intentionally invoked for comedic effect. The comic strips B.C., Alley Oop, the Spanish comic franchise Mortadelo y Filem√≥n, and occasionally The Far Side and Gogs portray \\"cavemen\\" with dinosaurs. Gary Larson, in his The Prehistory of the Far Side, stated he once felt that he needed to confess his cartooning sins in this regard: \\"O Father, I Have Portrayed Primitive Man and Dinosaurs In The Same Cartoon\\". The animated series The Flintstones, a spoof on family sitcoms, portrays the Flintstones even using dinosaurs, pterosaurs and prehistoric mammals as tools, household appliances, vehicles, and construction machines. Stereotypical cavemen are also often featured in advertising, including advertisements for Minute Maid. In early 2004, GEICO launched a series of television commercials and attempts at viral marketing, collectively known as the GEICO Cavemen advertising campaign, where GEICO announcers are repeatedly denounced by modern cavemen for perpetuating a stereotype of unintelligent, backward cavemen. The GEICO advertisements spawned a short-lived TV series called Cavemen.

He resigned from Congress after a much-publicized sex scandal in 1976. Early years Hays was born in Bannock, Ohio, the son of Bertha Taylor and Walter L. Hayes. He graduated from The Ohio State University in 1933. He served as mayor of Flushing, Ohio, from 1939 to 1945 and simultaneously served in the Ohio state senate in 1941 and 1942. Starting in 1945 he served a four-year term as Commissioner of Belmont County. He was a member of the Army Officers' Reserve Corps from 1933 until called to active duty as a second lieutenant on December 8, 1941, with a medical discharge in August 1942. Politics Hays, a Democrat, was elected to the 81st Congress in 1948, and was subsequently elected to thirteen succeeding Congresses. He was chairman of the powerful Committee on House Administration. Hays received 5 votes for President at the 1972 Democratic National Convention without campaigning for the office. In 1976, Hays ran for the party's nomination for President as a favorite son candidate in the Ohio primary. Hays's strong rule of the House Administration Committee extended to even the smallest items. In the mid-1970s, lawmakers avoided crossing Hays for fear that he would shut off the air conditioning in their offices.June 7, 1976 Time Wayne Hays on April 5, 1973 Sex scandal In May 1976, the Washington Post broke the story quoting Elizabeth Ray, Hays's former secretary, saying that Hays hired her on his staff, and later gave her a raise as staff of the House Administration Committee for two years, to serve as his mistress. Hays had divorced his wife of 38 years just months prior, and married his veteran Ohio office secretary, Patricia Peak, five weeks before the scandal broke. Ostensibly a secretary, Ray admitted: \\"I can't type. I can't file. I can't even answer the phone.\\" She even \\"let a reporter listen in as the Ohio congressman told her on the phone that his recent marriage (to another former secretary) would not affect their arrangement.\\"may 1986 The Washington Monthly Time Magazine reported, \\"Liz chose to tell her story after Hays decided to marry Pat Peak and did not invite her. 'I was good enough to be his mistress for two years but not good enough to be invited to his wedding,' she pouted.\\" Three days later, Hays admitted to most of the allegations on the House floor, denying only \\"that Miss Ray's federal salary was awarded solely for sexual services. She was not, insisted Hays, 'hired to be my mistress.'\\" He resigned as chairman of the Committee on House Administration on June 18, 1976, and then resigned from Congress on September 1, 1976. Marion L. Clark, a Washington Post editor, who was a member of team that reported the sex scandal, was killed September 4, 1977, when she reportedly walked into a moving small private airplane propeller at the airfield of Iosco County Airport, East Tawas, Michigan.Washington Post Editor Is Killed By Whirring Propeller Blades - The New York Times Personal life Mr. Hays and his first wife had a daughter, Martha Brigitta. Later years After leaving office, Hays returned to Red Gate Farm, his 300-acre property in Belmont, Ohio, where he bred Angus cattle and Tennessee walking horses. Hays served one term, from 1979 to 1981, as member of the Ohio House of Representatives. He was defeated for re-election by future Congressman Bob Ney. Jean Walker, a friend of the Hays family, said on February 10, 1989 that Mr. Hays died at Wheeling Hospital in Wheeling, West Virginia, at the age of 77. She said that Hays apparently suffered a heart attack about noon as he was reading a newspaper at his home. His wife, Patricia, was at his side.

On July 14, 1983, the House Ethics Committee recommended that Rep. Dan Crane (R-IL) and Rep. Gerry Studds (D-MA) be reprimanded for having engaged in sexual relationships with minors, specifically 17-year-old congressional pages.Committee on Standards of Official Conduct Though at least some of the sexual contact was not criminal, the committee felt \\"any sexual relationship between a member of the House of Representatives and a congressional page, or any sexual advance by a member to a page, represents a serious breach of duty.\\" The Congressional Report found that in 1980, a year after entering office, Crane had sex four or five times at his suburban apartment with a female page and in 1973, the year he entered office, Studds invited a male page, who testified he felt no ill will towards Studds, to his Georgetown apartment and later on a two-week trip to Portugal. Both representatives admitted to the charges. On July 20, 1983, the House voted by a supermajority to revise the reprimand recommendation to censure, a more extreme measure. Censure had never previously been used in a case of sexual misconduct. The motion to censure the two House members was introduced by Rep. Robert H. Michel (R-IL), the Republican House Minority Leader. Aides later said that Michel proposed this bill to head off a move by Republicans to expel the two legislators. Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-GA) was one of the leaders of the calls for the expulsion of Crane and Studds. At the beginning of the debate, Rep. Crane said, \\"I want the members to know I am sorry and that I apologize to one and all.\\" When he was called to be censured, Rep. Crane stood facing the House. According to The New York Times, after the censure was read, Mr. Crane, escorted by a friend, quickly left the chamber. However, an Associated Press article says that Crane walked back to his seat in the rear of the House and slumped in it. Crane would go on to lose the 1984 election.Politico: Sex scandals that still rattle from the cloakroom. June 8, 2011.

Ingalls is credited with suggesting the state motto and designing the state seal. Life and career John James Ingalls was born in Middleton, Massachusetts, on December 29, 1833. He graduated from Williams College in 1855. Foreshadowing his later reputation as a wit, his commencement oration, entitled \\"Mummy Life,\\" was a satire of college life. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1857. Moving to Kansas Territory, Ingalls settled in Atchison in 1860. He joined the anti-slavery forces and worked to make Kansas a free state. He was a member of the Wyandotte constitutional convention in 1859 and is reputed to have coined the state motto, Ad Astra per Aspera. When Kansas was admitted to the Union in 1861, he became secretary of the first state Senate and state senator in 1862. During the Civil War he served as judge advocate in the Kansas militia. As an editor of the Atchison newspaper, Freedom's Champion, for three years, he won a national reputation for a series of magazine articles. Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1873, succeeding Samuel C. Pomeroy, Ingalls served for 18 years. He supported labor and agriculture against monopolies. He also favored the Interstate Commerce Act and the Pendleton Civil Service Act. Ingalls rejected the nomination of James Campbell Matthews to the recorder of deeds in 1886. Ingalls claimed that his rejection was because of Matthews' non-residency of Washington, D.C.; however, journalists argued that his rejection was racially based.\\"The Senate Gives Reasons for Rejecting the Nomination of Matthews.\\" The New York Times.

Praised throughout his life for his keen sarcasm and quick wit, John James Ingalls died in Las Vegas, New Mexico on August 16, 1900. He was buried at Mount Vernon Cemetery in Atchison. In 1905, the state of Kansas donated a marble statue of Ingalls to the U.S. Capitol's National Statuary Hall Collection. In 2011, Kansas had plans to replace Ingalls with Amelia Earhart.

Structure The industry has four core players: * the merchant (also known as 'advertiser' or 'retailer' or 'brand') * the network (that contains offers for the affiliate to choose from and also takes care of the payments) * the publisher (also known as 'the affiliate') * the customer The market has grown in complexity, resulting in the emergence of a secondary tier of players, including affiliate management agencies, super-affiliates, and specialized third party vendors. Affiliate marketing overlaps with other Internet marketing methods to some degree because affiliates often use regular advertising methods. Those methods include organic search engine optimization (SEO), paid search engine marketing (PPC ‚Äì Pay Per Click), e-mail marketing, content marketing, and (in some sense) display advertising. On the other hand, affiliates sometimes use less orthodox techniques, such as publishing reviews of products or services offered by a partner. Affiliate marketing is commonly confused with referral marketing, as both forms of marketing use third parties to drive sales to the retailer. The two forms of marketing are differentiated, however, in how they drive sales, where affiliate marketing relies purely on financial motivations, while referral marketing relies more on trust and personal relationships. Affiliate marketing is frequently overlooked by advertisers.Prussakov, Evgenii (2007). \\"A Practical Guide to Affiliate Marketing\\" (pp.16-17), 2007. . While search engines, e-mail, and web site syndication capture much of the attention of online retailers, affiliate marketing carries a much lower profile. Still, affiliates continue to play a significant role in e-retailers' marketing strategies. History Origin The concept of revenue sharing‚Äîpaying commission for referred business‚Äîpredates affiliate marketing and the Internet. The translation of the revenue share principles to mainstream e-commerce happened in November 1994, almost four years after the origination of the World Wide Web. The concept of affiliate marketing on the Internet was conceived of, put into practice and patented by William J. Tobin, the founder of PC Flowers & Gifts. Launched on the Prodigy Network in 1989, PC Flowers & Gifts remained on the service until 1996. By 1993, PC Flowers & Gifts generated sales in excess of $6 million per year on the Prodigy service. In 1998, PC Flowers and Gifts developed the business model of paying a commission on sales to the Prodigy Network.Chicago Tribune, October 4, 1995The Sunsentinal, 1991 In 1994, Tobin launched a beta version of PC Flowers & Gifts on the Internet in cooperation with IBM, who owned half of Prodigy.PC Week Article, January 9, 1995 By 1995 PC Flowers & Gifts had launched a commercial version of the website and had 2,600 affiliate marketing partners on the World Wide Web. Tobin applied for a patent on tracking and affiliate marketing on January 22, 1996, and was issued U.S. Patent number 6,141,666 on Oct 31, 2000. Tobin also received Japanese Patent number 4021941 on Oct 5, 2007, and U.S. Patent number 7,505,913 on Mar 17, 2009, for affiliate marketing and tracking.Business Wire, January 24, 2000 In July 1998 PC Flowers and Gifts merged with Fingerhut and Federated Department Stores.Business Wire, March 31, 1999 In November 1994, CDNow launched its BuyWeb program. CDNow had the idea that music-oriented websites could review or list albums on their pages that their visitors might be interested in purchasing. These websites could also offer a link that would take visitors directly to CDNow to purchase the albums. The idea for remote purchasing originally arose from conversations with music label Geffen Records in the fall of 1994. The management at Geffen wanted to sell its artists' CD's directly from its website but did not want to implement this capability itself. Geffen asked CDNow if it could design a program where CDNow would handle the order fulfillment. Geffen realized that CDNow could link directly from the artist on its website to Geffen's website, bypassing the CDNow home page and going directly to an artist's music page.Olim, Jason; Olim, Matthew; and Kent, Peter (1999-01). \\"The CDNOW Story: Rags to Riches on the Internet\\", Top Floor Publishing, January 1999. . Amazon.com (Amazon) launched its associate program in July 1996: Amazon associates could place banner or text links on their site for individual books, or link directly to the Amazon home page. When visitors clicked on the associate's website to go to Amazon and purchase a book, the associate received a commission. Amazon was not the first merchant to offer an affiliate program, but its program was the first to become widely known and serve as a model for subsequent programs.Frank Fiore and Shawn Collins, \\"Successful Affiliate Marketing for Merchants\\", from pages 12, 13 and 14. QUE Publishing, April 2001 Gray, Daniel (1999-11-30). \\"The Complete Guide to Associate and Affiliate Programs on the Net\\". McGraw-Hill Trade, 30 November 1999. . In February 2000, Amazon announced that it had been granted a patent on components of an affiliate program. The patent application was submitted in June 1997, which predates most affiliate programs, but not PC Flowers & Gifts.com (October 1994), AutoWeb.com (October 1995), Kbkids.com/BrainPlay.com (January 1996), EPage (April 1996), and several others. Historic development Affiliate marketing has grown quickly since its inception. The e-commerce website, viewed as a marketing toy in the early days of the Internet, became an integrated part of the overall business plan and in some cases grew to a bigger business than the existing offline business. According to one report, the total sales amount generated through affiliate networks in 2006 was ¬£2.16 billion in the United Kingdom alone. The estimates were ¬£1.35 billion in sales in 2005.October 2006, Affiliate Marketing Networks Buyer's Guide (2006) , Page 6, e-Consultancy.com, retrieved June 25, 2007 MarketingSherpa's research team estimated that, in 2006, affiliates worldwide earned US$6.5 billion in bounty and commissions from a variety of sources in retail, personal finance, gaming and gambling, travel, telecom, education, publishing, and forms of lead generation other than contextual advertising programs.Anne Holland, publisher (January 11, 2006), Affiliate Summit 2006 Wrap-Up Report -- Commissions to Reach $6.5 Billion in 2006, MarketingSherpa, retrieved on May 17, 2007 In 2006, the most active sectors for affiliate marketing were the adult gambling, retail industries and file-sharing services. The three sectors expected to experience the greatest growth are the mobile phone, finance, and travel sectors. Soon after these sectors came the entertainment (particularly gaming) and Internet-related services (particularly broadband) sectors. Also several of the affiliate solution providers expect to see increased interest from business-to-business marketers and advertisers in using affiliate marketing as part of their mix. Web 2.0 Websites and services based on Web 2.0 concepts‚Äîblogging and interactive online communities, for example‚Äîhave impacted the affiliate marketing world as well. These platforms allow improved communication between merchants and affiliates. Web 2.0 platforms have also opened affiliate marketing channels to personal bloggers, writers, and independent website owners. Contextual ads allow publishers with lower levels of web traffic to place affiliate ads on websites. Forms of new media have also diversified how companies, brands, and ad networks serve ads to visitors. For instance, YouTube allows video-makers to embed advertisements through Google's affiliate network. New developments have made it more difficult for unscrupulous affiliates to make money. Emerging black sheep are detected and made known to the affiliate marketing community with much greater speed and efficiency. Compensation methods Predominant compensation methods Eighty percent of affiliate programs today use revenue sharing or pay per sale (PPS) as a compensation method, nineteen percent use cost per action (CPA), and the remaining programs use other methods such as cost per click (CPC) or cost per mille (CPM, cost per estimated 1000 views). Diminished compensation methods Within more mature markets, less than one percent of traditional affiliate marketing programs today use cost per click and cost per mille. However, these compensation methods are used heavily in display advertising and paid search. Cost per mille requires only that the publisher make the advertising available on his or her website and display it to the page visitors in order to receive a commission. Pay per click requires one additional step in the conversion process to generate revenue for the publisher: A visitor must not only be made aware of the advertisement but must also click on the advertisement to visit the advertiser's website. Cost per click was more common in the early days of affiliate marketing but has diminished in use over time due to click fraud issues very similar to the click fraud issues modern search engines are facing today. Contextual advertising programs are not considered in the statistic pertaining to the diminished use of cost per click, as it is uncertain if contextual advertising can be considered affiliate marketing. While these models have diminished in mature e-commerce and online advertising markets they are still prevalent in some more nascent industries. China is one example where Affiliate Marketing does not overtly resemble the same model in the West. With many affiliates being paid a flat \\"Cost Per Day\\" with some networks offering Cost Per Click or CPM. Performance/affiliate marketing In the case of cost per mille/click, the publisher is not concerned about whether a visitor is a member of the audience that the advertiser tries to attract and is able to convert because at this point the publisher has already earned his commission. This leaves the greater, and, in case of cost per mille, the full risk and loss (if the visitor cannot be converted) to the advertiser. Cost per action/sale methods require that referred visitors do more than visit the advertiser's website before the affiliate receives a commission. The advertiser must convert that visitor first. It is in the best interest of the affiliate to send the most closely targeted traffic to the advertiser as possible to increase the chance of a conversion. The risk and loss are shared between the affiliate and the advertiser. Affiliate marketing is also called \\"performance marketing\\", in reference to how sales employees are typically being compensated. Such employees are typically paid a commission for each sale they close, and sometimes are paid performance incentives for exceeding objectives.CellarStone Inc. (2006), Sales Commission, QCommission.com, retrieved June 25, 2007 Affiliates are not employed by the advertiser whose products or services they promote, but the compensation models applied to affiliate marketing are very similar to the ones used for people in the advertisers' internal sales department. The phrase, \\"Affiliates are an extended sales force for your business\\", which is often used to explain affiliate marketing, is not completely accurate. The primary difference between the two is that affiliate marketers provide little if any influence on a possible prospect in the conversion process once that prospect is directed to the advertiser's website. The sales team of the advertiser, however, does have the control and influence up to the point where the prospect either a) signs the contract, or b) completes the purchase. Multi-tier programs Some advertisers offer multi-tier programs that distribute commission into a hierarchical referral network of sign-ups and sub-partners. In practical terms, publisher \\"A\\" signs up to the program with an advertiser and gets rewarded for the agreed activity conducted by a referred visitor. If publisher \\"A\\" attracts publishers \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" to sign up for the same program using his sign-up code, all future activities performed by publishers \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" will result in additional commission (at a lower rate) for publisher \\"A\\". Two-tier programs exist in the minority of affiliate programs; most are simply one- tier. Referral programs beyond two-tier resemble multi-level marketing (MLM) or network marketing but are different: Multi-level marketing (MLM) or network marketing associations tend to have more complex commission requirements/qualifications than standard affiliate programs. From the advertiser's perspective Advantages for merchants Merchants favor affiliate marketing because in most cases it uses a \\"pay for performance\\" model, meaning that the merchant does not incur a marketing expense unless results are accrued (excluding any initial setup cost).Tom Taulli (9 November 2005), Creating A Virtual Sales Force, Forbes.com Business. Retrieved 14 May 2007. Implementation options Some merchants run their own (in-house) affiliate programs using dedicated software, while others use third-party intermediaries to track traffic or sales that are referred from affiliates. There are two different types of affiliate management methods used by merchants: standalone software or hosted services, typically called affiliate networks. Payouts to affiliates or publishers can be made by the networks on behalf of the merchant, by the network, consolidated across all merchants where the publisher has a relationship with and earned commissions or directly by the merchant itself. Affiliate management and program management outsourcing Uncontrolled affiliate programs aid rogue affiliates, who use spamming,Danny Sullivan (June 27, 2006), The Daily SearchCast News from June 27, 2006 , WebmasterRadio.fm, retrieved May 17, 2007 trademark infringement, false advertising, cookie stuffing, typosquatting,Wayne Porter (September 6, 2006), NEW FIRST: LinkShare- Lands' End Versus The Affiliate on Typosquatting , ReveNews, retrieved on May 17, 2007 and other unethical methods that have given affiliate marketing a negative reputation. Some merchants are using outsourced (affiliate) program management (OPM) companies, which are themselves often run by affiliate managers and network program managers.Jennifer D. Meacham (July/August 2006), Going Out Is In , Revenue Magazine, published by Montgomery Research Inc, Issue 12., Page 36 OPM companies perform affiliate program management for the merchants as a service, similar to the role an advertising agencies serves in offline marketing. Types of affiliate websites Affiliate websites are often categorized by merchants (advertisers) and affiliate networks. There are currently no industry-wide standards for the categorization. The following types of websites are generic, yet are commonly understood and used by affiliate marketers. * Search affiliates that utilize pay per click search engines to promote the advertisers' offers (i.e., search arbitrage) * Price comparison service websites and directories * Loyalty websites, typically characterized by providing a reward or incentive system for purchases via points, miles, cash back * Cause Related Marketing sites that offer charitable donations * Coupon and rebate websites that focus on sales promotions * Content and niche market websites, including product review sites * Personal websites * Weblogs and websites syndication feeds * E-mail marketing list affiliates (i.e., owners of large opt-in -mail lists that typically employ e-mail drip marketing) and newsletter list affiliates, which are typically more content- heavy * Registration path or co-registration affiliates who include offers from other merchants during the registration process on their own website * Shopping directories that list merchants by categories without providing coupons, price comparisons, or other features based on information that changes frequently, thus requiring continual updates * Cost per action networks (i.e., top-tier affiliates) that expose offers from the advertiser with which they are affiliated with their own network of affiliates * Websites using adbars (e.g. AdSense) to display context-sensitive advertising for products on the site * Virtual currency that offers advertising views in exchange for a handout of virtual currency in a game or other virtual platform. * File-Sharing: Web sites that host directories of music, movies, games and other software. Users upload content to file-hosting sites and then post descriptions of the material and their download links on directory sites. Uploaders are paid by the file-hosting sites based on the number of times their files are downloaded. The file-hosting sites sell premium download access to the files to the general public. The websites that host the directory services sell advertising and do not host the files themselves. * Video sharing websites: YouTube videos are often utilized by affiliates to do affiliate marketing. A person would create a video and place a link to the affiliate product they are promoting in the video itself and within the description. Publisher recruitment Affiliate networks that already have several advertisers typically also have a large pool of publishers. These publishers could be potentially recruited, and there is also an increased chance that publishers in the network apply to the program on their own, without the need for recruitment efforts by the advertiser. Relevant websites that attract the same target audiences as the advertiser but without competing with it are potential affiliate partners as well. Vendors or existing customers can also become recruits if doing so makes sense and does not violate any laws or regulations (such as with pyramid schemes). Almost any website could be recruited as an affiliate publisher, but high traffic websites are more likely interested in (for their sake) low-risk cost per mille or medium-risk cost per click deals rather than higher-risk cost per action or revenue share deals.Marios Alexandrou (February 4th, 2007), CPM vs. CPC vs. CPA , All Things SEM, retrieved November 11, 2007 Locating affiliate programs There are three primary ways to locate affiliate programs for a target website: # Affiliate program directories, # Large affiliate networks that provide the platform for dozens or even hundreds of advertisers, and # The target website itself. (Websites that offer an affiliate program often have a link titled \\"affiliate program\\", \\"affiliates\\", \\"referral program\\", or \\"webmasters\\"‚Äîusually in the footer or \\"About\\" section of the website.) If the above locations do not yield information pertaining to affiliates, it may be the case that there exists a non-public affiliate program. Utilizing one of the common website correlation methods may provide clues about the affiliate network. The most definitive method for finding this information is to contact the website owner directly if a contact method can be located. Past and current issues Since the emergence of affiliate marketing, there has been little control over affiliate activity. Unscrupulous affiliates have used spam, false advertising, forced clicks (to get tracking cookies set on users' computers), adware, and other methods to drive traffic to their sponsors. Although many affiliate programs have terms of service that contain rules against spam, this marketing method has historically proven to attract abuse from spammers. E-mail spam In the infancy of affiliate marketing, many Internet users held negative opinions due to the tendency of affiliates to use spam to promote the programs in which they were enrolled.Ryan Singel (October 2, 2005), Shady Web of Affiliate Marketing, Wired.com, retrieved May 17, 2007 As affiliate marketing matured, many affiliate merchants have refined their terms and conditions to prohibit affiliates from spamming.

In recent years, there has been a constant rise in the number of malicious browser extensions flooding the web. Malicious browser extensions will often appear to be legitimate as they seem to originate from vendor websites and come with glowing customer reviews. In the case of affiliate marketing, these malicious extensions are often used to redirect a user's browser to send fake clicks to websites that are supposedly part of legitimate affiliate marketing programs. Typically, users are completely unaware this is happening other than their browser performance slowing down. Websites end up paying for fake traffic numbers, and users are unwitting participants in these ad schemes. Search engine spam As search engines have become more prominent, some affiliate marketers have shifted from sending e-mail spam to creating automatically generated web pages that often contain product data feeds provided by merchants. The goal of such web pages is to manipulate the relevancy or prominence of resources indexed by a search engine, also known as spamdexing. Each page can be targeted to a different niche market through the use of specific keywords, with the result being a skewed form of search engine optimization. Spam is the biggest threat to organic search engines, whose goal is to provide quality search results for keywords or phrases entered by their users. Google's PageRank algorithm update (\\"BigDaddy\\") in February 2006‚Äîthe final stage of Google's major update (\\"Jagger\\") that began in mid-summer 2005‚Äîspecifically targeted spamdexing with great success. This update thus enabled Google to remove a large amount of mostly computer-generated duplicate content from its index.Jim Hedger (September 6, 2006), Being a Bigdaddy Jagger Meister , WebProNews.com, retrieved on December 16, 2007 Websites consisting mostly of affiliate links have previously held a negative reputation for underdelivering quality content. In 2005 there were active changes made by Google, where certain websites were labeled as \\"thin affiliates\\".Spam Recognition Guide for Raters (Word document) supposedly leaked out from Google in 2005. The authenticity of the document was neither acknowledged nor challenged by Google. Such websites were either removed from Google's index or were relocated within the results page (i.e., moved from the top-most results to a lower position). To avoid this categorization, affiliate marketer webmasters must create quality content on their websites that distinguishes their work from the work of spammers or banner farms, which only contain links leading to merchant sites. Adware Although it differs from spyware, adware often uses the same methods and technologies. Merchants initially were uninformed about adware, what impact it had, and how it could damage their brands. Affiliate marketers became aware of the issue much more quickly, especially because they noticed that adware often overwrites tracking cookies, thus resulting in a decline of commissions. Affiliates not employing adware felt that it was stealing commission from them. Adware often has no valuable purpose and rarely provides any useful content to the user, who is typically unaware that such software is installed on his/her computer. Affiliates discussed the issues in Internet forums and began to organize their efforts. They believed that the best way to address the problem was to discourage merchants from advertising via adware. Merchants that were either indifferent to or supportive of adware were exposed by affiliates, thus damaging those merchants' reputations and tarnishing their affiliate marketing efforts. Many affiliates either terminated the use of such merchants or switched to a competitor's affiliate program. Eventually, affiliate networks were also forced by merchants and affiliates to take a stand and ban certain adware publishers from their network. The result was Code of Conduct by Commission Junction/beFree and Performics,December 10, 2002, Online Marketing Service Providers Announce Web Publisher Code of Conduct (contains original CoC text), CJ.com, retrieved June 26, 2007 LinkShare's Anti-Predatory Advertising Addendum,December 12, 2002, LinkShare's Anti-Predatory Advertising Addendum, LinkShare.com, retrieved June 26, 2007 and ShareASale's complete ban of software applications as a medium for affiliates to promote advertiser offers.ShareASale Affiliate Service Agreement, ShareASale.com, retrieved June 26, 2007 Regardless of the progress made, adware continues to be an issue, as demonstrated by the class action lawsuit against ValueClick and its daughter company Commission Junction filed on April 20, 2007.April 20, 2007, AdWare Class Action Lawsuit against - ValueClick, Commission Junction and beFree , Law Firms of Nassiri & Jung LLP and Hagens Berman, retrieved from CJClassAction.com on June 26, 2007 Trademark bidding Affiliates were among the earliest adopters of pay per click advertising when the first pay- per-click search engines emerged during the end of the 1990s. Later in 2000 Google launched its pay per click service, Google AdWords, which is responsible for the widespread use and acceptance of pay per click as an advertising channel. An increasing number of merchants engaged in pay per click advertising, either directly or via a search marketing agency, and realized that this space was already occupied by their affiliates. Although this situation alone created advertising channel conflicts and debates between advertisers and affiliates, the largest issue concerned affiliates bidding on advertisers names, brands, and trademarks. Several advertisers began to adjust their affiliate program terms to prohibit their affiliates from bidding on those type of keywords. Some advertisers, however, did and still do embrace this behavior, going so far as to allow, or even encourage, affiliates to bid on any term, including the advertiser's trademarks. Compensation disclosure Bloggers and other publishers may not be aware of disclosure guidelines set forth by the FTC. Guidelines affect celebrity endorsements, advertising language, and blogger compensation.FTC Publishes Final Guides Governing Endorsements, Testimonials. Ftc.gov (2013-06-27). Retrieved on 2013-09-19. Lack of industry standards =Certification and training= Affiliate marketing currently lacks industry standards for training and certification. There are some training courses and seminars that result in certifications; however, the acceptance of such certifications is mostly due to the reputation of the individual or company issuing the certification. Affiliate marketing is not commonly taught in universities, and only a few college instructors work with Internet marketers to introduce the subject to students majoring in marketing.Alexandra Wharton (March/April 2007), Learning Outside the Box, Revenue Magazine, Issue: March/April 2007, Page 58, link to online version retrieved June 26, 2007 Education occurs most often in \\"real life\\" by becoming involved and learning the details as time progresses. Although there are several books on the topic, some so-called \\"how-to\\" or \\"silver bullet\\" books instruct readers to manipulate holes in the Google algorithm, which can quickly become out of date, or suggest strategies no longer endorsed or permitted by advertisers. Outsourced Program Management companies typically combine formal and informal training, providing much of their training through group collaboration and brainstorming. Such companies also try to send each marketing employee to the industry conference of their choice.March/April 2007, How Do Companies Train Affiliate Managers?

Sales tax vulnerability In 2008 the state of New York passed a law asserting sales tax jurisdiction over Amazon.com sales to New York residents. New York was aware of Amazon affiliates operating within the state. In Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, the US Supreme Court ruled that the presence of independent sales representatives may allow a state to require sales tax collections. New York determined that affiliates are such independent sales representatives. The New York law became known as \\"Amazon's law\\" and was quickly emulated by other states. While that was the first time states successfully addressed the internet tax gap, since 2018 states have been free to assert sales tax jurisdiction over sales to their residents regardless of the presence of retailer affiliates.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed May 4, 2011 tributary of the Henrys Fork of the Snake River in southeastern Idaho in the United States. It drains through the Teton Valley along the west side of the Teton Range along the Idaho-Wyoming border at the eastern end of the Snake River Plain. Its location along the western flank of the Tetons provides the river with more rainfall than many other rivers of the region. History At the time of the arrival of the Europeans to the region in the 1820s, the area was inhabited by the Shoshone and various related tribes. The lushness of the Teton Basin provided prime area for the fur trade, attracting many other tribes to region, including the Nez Perce, Flathead and the Gros Ventre. At the time, the basin was part of the disputed Oregon Country. The resulting friction between the trading groups led to recurring skirmishes in the basin. In 1832, a trade rendezvous gone awry resulted in the Battle of Pierre's Hole between the Gros Ventre and a party of American trappers, led by William Sublette and aided by their Nez Perce and Flathead allies. In the brief but bloody battle at least twenty-six Gros Ventres were killed, including women and children, and perhaps a dozen whites and Flatheads. Sublette received severe injuries and returned east to the United States for medical care. The most famous modern incident along the river occurred on June 5, 1976 when the earthen Teton Dam in Teton Canyon collapsed, killing 11 people in the valley below. The force of water due to the dam failure destroyed the lower part of the Teton River, washing away riparian zones and reducing the canyon walls. This seriously damaged the stream ecology, and the native cutthroat trout population has been endangered. The force of the water and excessive sediment also damaged stream habitat in the Snake River and some tributaries. Watershed Flyfisherman on private water in restored section of Fox Creek, Teton River tributary in Autumn, 2017 The Teton River watershed drains , in Idaho and in Wyoming. The river mainstem is formed near Victor in Teton County, Idaho, near the Wyoming state line, by the confluence of Warm Creek (Trail Creek watershed) and Drake Creek. It is joined by several additional creeks that descend from surrounding Teton, Big Hole, and Snake River mountain ranges. The majority of flows to the Teton River come from tributaries draining the western flank of the Tetons, including Trail, Fox, Teton, and South Leigh creeks. Trail Creek descends along Highway 22 from the Caribou- Targhee National Forest in Idaho, meeting the other creeks from the south. The river flows north in a slow meandering course through a broad flat valley called the Teton Basin (formerly known as \\"Pierre's Hole\\"), flanked by the Teton Range to the east and the Big Hole Mountains to the west. Much of the river's upper course in the Teton Basin is surrounded by extensive wetlands. After emerging from the north end of the Teton Basin, the Teton River enters the nearly inaccessible Teton Canyon, approximately long, along the Teton- Fremont county line. There it is joined by Badger Creek and Bitch Creek from the east, then turns almost 90 degrees west, and is joined by Canyon Creek from the south. After passing through the failed Teton Dam site, north and east of Newdale, the Teton River bifurcates into two distributaries some four miles downstream, just north of Teton, one called the South Fork Teton River (also called the South Teton River) and the other called North Fork Teton River (also known as the Teton River). The South Teton River travels generally southwest until it joins Henry's Fork west of Rexburg at the southwest end of a large inland delta region on the Henry's Fork, essentially merging with the delta from the east as one of its channels. The Teton River itself (North Fork Teton) continues to travel west, where it joins the Henrys Fork at Warm Slough near Rexburg, approximately seven miles upstream of the confluence with the Snake River. Ecology The upper watershed between Victor and Driggs are key targets for restoration by the Friends of Teton River as they harbor the best spawning habitat for Yellowstone cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri). An Idaho Fish and Game study reported a 95% decline in Yellowstone cutthroat trout (YCT) while non-native brook trout (Salvenlinus fontinalis) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) populations increased by 300%. The Teton River is considered one of three remaining strongholds for YCT, which currently only survive in 27% of their former range in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Hybridization with nonnative rainbow trout has been the primary factor reducing YCT populations. Other factors include competition with nonnative brook trout and habitat degradation from water diversion, grazing, mining, timber harvest and development.

It has one main campus based in the city of Stoke-on-Trent and three other campuses; in Stafford, Lichfield and Shrewsbury.  History  In 1901, industrialist Alfred Bolton acquired a site on what is now College Road and in 1906 mining classes began there. In 1907, pottery classes followed, being transferred from Tunstall into temporary buildings, and in 1914 the building now known as the Cadman Building was officially opened as the Central School of Science and Technology by J. A. Pease, President of the Board of Education. A frieze over the entrance depicts potters and miners. In 2013, the Library Conference room in the Cadman building was renamed the Alfred Bolton room. In 1915, a department was established for the commercial production of Seger cones used to measure and control the temperatures of ceramic furnaces, based upon research completed by the principal, Joseph Mellor. Grants from the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust in 1924 were used to develop the ceramics library and in 1926 the name of the institution was changed to North Staffordshire Technical College. By 1931 extensions to the Cadman Building ran along Station Road and housed the Mining Department. A grant was awarded from the Miners‚Äô Welfare Fund to fund the building work. The new extension also housed the library, which by now had 35,000 volumes. By 1934 the college consisted of four departments: Engineering (nearly 800 students), Pottery (just over 600 students), Mining (just under 500 students), and Chemistry (under 300 students). In 1939, new engineering workshops were occupied for the first time and the land opposite the Cadman Building was purchased. By 1950 Victoria Road changed its name to College Road and the site now extended over . The Mellor Building and Experimental Production Block (now Dwight Building) were constructed for the North Staffordshire College of Technology by 1960. Various faculty movements and further building work resulted in North Staffordshire Polytechnic being formed in 1970 with the merger of Stoke-on- Trent College of Art, North Staffordshire College of Technology (both based in Stoke-on-Trent), and Staffordshire College of Technology in Stafford. In 1977, the polytechnic absorbed a teacher training facility in Madeley, Staffordshire. The polytechnic developed traditional strengths of the component institutions, e.g. ceramics (Stoke-on-Trent), computing (Stafford) and sports education (Madeley). The mining department closed as result of the decline of coal mining in the 1980s. New subjects were developed. North Staffordshire Polytechnic was among only a handful of third-level institutions in the UK to offer International Relations as a dedicated degree. The 1992 UK government Research Assessment Exercise placed the International Relations Department as the highest-rated in the institution. In 1988, the institution changed its name to Staffordshire Polytechnic. In 1992, it became Staffordshire University, one of the new universities based on former Polytechnics.  Campuses  Staffordshire University, College Road, Stoke. The building shown is the former technical college, opened 1914 The university has two main campuses, four smaller campuses, and extensive links with National, European and transnational academic institutions. The two main campuses (Stoke-on-Trent and Stafford) and the Lichfield campus all have purpose built Business Villages, having fully furnished small office spaces with internet access. In the 2012/13 academic year, the then Vice-Chancellor, Michael Gunn, announced that a consultation exercise would be undertaken on whether to keep both campuses (Stafford and Stoke) open or whether to close one. As yet no definitive conclusion has been made and the ultimate result will based on many factors including student feedback and financial viability. It is anticipated that the review will take a year to carry out. The university announced the result of their Estates Strategy on 30 January 2014 after the Board of Governors met at a special meeting to decide on it the night before. The decision was made to move the computing and entertainment technology courses to the Stoke-on-Trent campus by 2016 and health courses in Stafford will remain. Stoke-on-Trent The main campus is in Shelton, Stoke-on-Trent, and primarily offers law, business, sciences, applied computing, engineering, arts, design, journalism and media production courses. These are split into two areas, one on College Road (on the site of the former County Cricket Ground), and the other on Leek Road. A new Science and Technology facility was opened in 2012 as part of a major redevelopment adjacent to Stoke-on-Trent railway station. The Mellor Building on the College Road campus, formerly housing science teaching, has been refurbished to become the new home of the School of Engineering (which moved from Stafford Beaconside) in 2013 and of Applied Computing, which moved from the Brindley Building in 2013. A large section of the campus is supported by AirNet, the university's free wireless connection. The Stoke campus also features its own student nightclub called the \\"LRV\\" short for the Leek Road Venue. This nightclub hosts a variety of student nights on various days of the week but its main open nights are on a Wednesday and Friday. A public film theatre is situated on the side of the Flaxman building on College Road, which shows mainstream and independent films on a regular basis to an audience of up to 180 people, as well as being used for large lectures. In 2006, a new TV studio facility was opened by former BBC Director General Greg Dyke in the Arts, Media and Design faculty building on College Road, Stoke. The new ¬£1 million development features up-to-date technology and industry specification equipment. The university wants to develop a partnership with Stoke-on-Trent College and Stoke-on-Trent 6th Form College and with the co-operation of the local education authority and the city council, a \\"University Quarter\\" in the urban area to the north-east of Stoke-on-Trent railway station that is already home to the university and the two colleges. The vision is that the University Quarter (located between College Road and Leek Road) will attract both students and developers and become a gateway to the city and to the region. Commercial activities include a spin-off company Flux Stoke-on-Trent which was launched in 2011 to produce decorated bone china designed by students on the university's MA Ceramic Design course. The company has won two national awards and designs are exported to 20 countries.University of Staffordshire, Digital Institute London  Digital Institute London is a brand-new institution devoted to training the technological pioneers of the future. Digital Institute London is a part of Staffordshire University and is based at Here East in London. The campus will officially open in September 2019. Stafford and Shrewsbury  Nursing, midwifery, operating department practice and paramedic science courses are taught at the Centre of Excellence in Stafford on Blackheath Lane and at the Centre of Excellence in Shrewsbury which is situated at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital. Staffordshire University has closed the Stafford campus but have kept the Centre of Excellence in Stafford on Blackheath. Lichfield The main entrance to the Lichfield Campus building In 1998, in partnership with Tamworth and Lichfield College, the university opened a newly built campus in Lichfield near Lichfield City railway station. Shrewsbury, Telford, and Oswestry This part of the university is mainly for nursing and midwifery courses, and is still part of the university despite all three settlements being located in the neighbouring county of Shropshire. Overseas The university has many overseas students studying for Staffordshire University awards in Belgium, China, Vietnam, France, Greece, India, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria, Singapore, Spain, and Sri Lanka. The university also conducts a twinning programme with DISTED College in George Town, Penang, Malaysia. Staffordshire University offers programmes in Hung Yen, Ecopark Township, Vietnam through the British University Vietnam. The university has a strong partnership with the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium. Halls of residence The university offers guaranteed accommodation for all first-year students, provided the university is their firm UCAS choice. All accommodation is situated close to all teaching, sporting, and Union venues. =Stafford= The Stafford campus has its own halls of residence, Stafford Court, comprising over 264 en-suite single study bedrooms and 290 single study bedrooms with shared facilities. The various houses take their names from villages in Staffordshire: Brocton, Derrington, Eccleshall, Gnosall, Haughton, Knightley, Levedale, Milwich, Norbury, Ranton, Shugborough and Weston. A separate block of larger flats, named after the village of Yarlet (previously Beckett Hall), is also on the same site. This comprises an additional 51 single-study bedrooms over three floors, each accommodating 17 residents, who share a kitchen, dining room and four shower rooms. All of these halls are directly opposite the Stafford campus buildings on Weston Road. By September 2016 only the midwifery, nursing, paramedic science, operation department practitioners and other allied and public health courses will remain at the Blackheath Lane site (Stafford) with the rest moved to Stoke.The Sunday Times Good University Guide 2015, accessed 15 October 2015 =Stoke= At Stoke, halls of residence are primarily situated on the Leek Road campus. The shared-bathroom accommodation was sponsored by various local potteries, and halls are therefore named after them, for example Royal Doulton, Coalport, Mintons, Spode, Aynsley and Wedgwood halls. The on-campus en-suite accommodation is contained within Clarice Cliff Court, comprising seven halls, each of about 30 students over three floors, each hall named after female ceramicists: Rachel Bishop, Eve Midwinter, Jessie van Hallen, Charlotte Rhead, Jessie Tait, Millicent Taplin and Star Wedgwood. Along with the halls and en-suite, the university also offers 32 houses, known as the Leek Road Houses, each of which accommodates up to 6 people each. Carlton House, Etruscan House, Caledonia Road, Queen Anne Street Flats, Cromwell Court, Church Street and Sovereign House are situated off campus. They are all within of the Stoke Campus, and are reserved for postgraduate and returning (second and third year) students. The Shelton area of Stoke is where many students choose to live after their first year. The proximity of Shelton to the university and the large quantity of student accommodation has effectively turned it into a mini-student village. Alternatively, there are also the popular College Court Halls, which are privately run but operate in a similar way to university-run halls. They are situated opposite Hanley Park and are close to the university.  Academic profile  The university is noted for its science departments; in 2002 Staffordshire's Psychology Department was among the top ten in the country, while Molecular Biochemistry and Biosciences were rated as 'excellent' by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education. The Science Faculty together with most of the university also does consistently well in the National Student Survey and measures of graduate level employment after graduation. The School of Computing was originally situated at Blackheath Lane on the edge of Stafford in GEC's former Nelson Research Laboratory. It offered one of the first BSc courses in computing in the United Kingdom and its first major computer was a second hand DEUCE. The School of Computing later moved to a purpose-built building on the Beaconside campus, the Octagon, constructed in 1992 when university status had been achieved. The Faculty of Computing, Engineering and Sciences (FCES) is a Cisco Networking Academy. The university was the first institution to introduce a single honours degree in Film, Television and Radio Studies in 1990. A new Media Centre was opened by Greg Dyke in 2005, comprising radio studios, television news desk and broadcast journalist suite. Courses in print, broadcast and sports journalism are nationally accredited by the National Council for the Training of Journalists and the Broadcast Journalism Training Council. The Forensic Science degrees (Forensic Science, Forensic Science and Criminology and Forensic Science and Psychology) were accredited by the Forensic Science Society (FSC) in 2007, one of four universities whose courses have been acknowledged for teaching services and high academic quality. The Forensic theme is continued with a specialist Forensic Biology degree and on the Stafford Campus the Faculty of Computing Engineering and Technology was one of the first university faculties in the UK to offer undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in the new field of Forensic Computing. League table rankings The university's world ranking is 1,354 in 2010, according to webometrics.info.  Student life   Students' Union  Staffordshire University Students' Union aims to represent students at the university. Constitutionally it is governed by the student body, who annually elect a student council which is responsible for the organisation of the Union. The day-to-day operation of the union is handled by four Sabbatical Officers and four student trustees, who are held to account by the Council. All officer positions, bar the four sabbatical officers, work on a part-time basis.  Sports  Since 2007, Staffordshire University (Stoke Campus) and Keele University have engaged in an annual varsity match. In 2013 Staffordshire University (Stafford Campus) and Wolverhampton University engaged in an annual varsity match.

He is a sales representative at the Slough branch of Wernham Hogg Paper Merchants. He has a self-deprecating and ironic sense of humour. Tim flirts with, and feels great attraction to, the receptionist Dawn Tinsley. His office nemesis is Gareth Keenan, with whom he regularly exchanges insults and on whom he frequently plays practical jokes. His relationship with his boss David Brent is mixed; at times Tim seems to get along well with David, and often patiently humours Brent's attempts at comedy and social interaction. However, like the other employees, he is often exasperated by Brent's more extreme personality flaws. In many ways, he is Brent's complete opposite. While Brent tends to alienate people with his constant displays of arrogance and insecurities, Tim is liked by almost everyone due largely to his kindness, his cheeky-chappy sense of humour and his overall laid-back attitude. However, he lives an unsatisfying life ‚Äì at 30, he still lives with his parents and works in a job for which he has no passion or interest. Having dropped out of university after a year, he hopes to return and get a Psychology degree, but his hidden insecurity prevents him from doing so. His regular pranks on Gareth are one of his ways of maintaining his sanity. At the end of the first series, Tim abandons his plan to quit his office job and return to university to earn a degree in Psychology. He reveals to Dawn that David Brent has \\"promoted\\" him to Senior Sales Clerk which includes a raise of 500 pounds. As Tim relays this information, he begins speaking in a distinctly Brent-esque style, using vague syllogisms and empty phrases with no clear meaning behind them. He also backpedals on a lot of the career advice he previously gave to Dawn, and suggests that his new title has set him upon a more desirable path. In the second series, although Tim retains much of his former ironic humour, much of his self-deprecation is absent. Despite his promotion being little more than tokenistic, he takes his job much more seriously, and insists that others do the same. This suggests a potential parallel between Tim and David Brent in terms of their career trajectory: the casual and flippant attitude being discarded upon receiving a taste of authority (however insignificant) and buying into the corporate, pencil- pushing mentality. Tim's equivalent in the American version of The Office is Jim Halpert. His French equivalents are Paul Delorme (played by Jeremie Elkaim) and Louis Tremblay. Relationship with Dawn Tinsley Apart from being her colleague and close friend, Tim harbours strong feelings for Dawn. Their relationship is very flirtatious at times. However, Dawn's engagement to Lee prevents them from becoming more than friends for quite some time. Their friendship seems to suffer after the episode Training Day, in which Dawn and Lee are having problems. Tim consoles her throughout the episode, but mistakenly comes to the conclusion that Lee and Dawn have split. He then asks Dawn out on a date in front of everyone, where she tells him that she and Lee are still together. Embarrassed, Tim insists he was just asking her out as a friend. During the second series, Dawn and Tim remain friends, but do not seem to be as close anymore. Tim starts to take his job more seriously after being promoted and becomes somewhat distant toward Dawn at first. Tim also begins to date Rachel, one of the former Swindon employees, and Dawn grows jealous (along with Gareth, who claims he had feelings for Rachel before Tim and doesn't understand why she wants to go out with someone who looks like a Fisher Price Man). In the fifth episode of the second series, Dawn is selling kisses for Red Nose Day. After Tim makes a contribution, they share a kiss. Tim is then driven to choose between Rachel and Dawn, unaware of Dawn and Lee's plans to move to the United States. In the next episode he makes his decision, breaking up with Rachel. Tim soon discovers that Dawn is leaving for Florida with Lee. Initially Tim seems reluctant to say anything, but changes his mind during an interview with the camera crew and runs to tell Dawn how he feels. Their conversation is kept private as Tim takes off his mic, but he emerges unsuccessful and admits Dawn said no. The second series ends with both Dawn and Tim depressed. Three years pass, with Tim remaining complacent in his job at Wernham Hogg and Dawn existing unhappily with Lee in Florida. Dawn and Lee are flown back for the reunion, and she resumes her friendship with Tim briefly. When Dawn receives a Christmas present from Tim encouraging her to hold on to her dream of becoming an illustrator, she returns to the Christmas party without Lee, where she and Tim kiss and finally become a couple.

According to its lead developer Makoto Kinoshita, the goal of Shiira was \\"to create a browser that is better and more useful than Safari\\". Shiira used WebKit for rendering and scripting. The project reached version 2.3 before it was discontinued, and by December 2011 the developer's website had been removed. Features and performance Since the browser was developed with Safari in mind, the main characteristics of the two browsers are similar. For example, Shiira employs private browsing options so that history and cookies are not recorded when activated. However, the search engines search field on the toolbar includes many search engines. Shiira also uses Cocoa programming to provide users with a customizable drawer extending from the left or right of the window. The drawer includes bookmarks, history, downloads, and an RSS reader. In version 2.0, the sidebar was replaced by a series of palettes opened and closed from the main window toolbar. Shiira natively supports in-browser PDF viewing. Style The features of Shiira include appearance options. Users may switch between Aqua or Metal styles in addition to changing the buttons' appearances. However, in the current 2.0 release, changes in themes are, as yet, not available. Tabs are also customizable. Another option is \\"Tab Expos√©\\", which acts much like the Expos√© feature of Mac OS X; each tab is visible in its totality, enabling users to select the tab to which they wish to navigate. The 1.x releases of Shiira also have a page-turning effect for transitions between any two webpages; however, this was dropped from 2.x releases. The new interface in Shiira 2.0 can be set to display tabs as thumbnails along the bottom or sides of the window. Versions The latest release (version 2.3) requires Mac OS X 10.4 or later. Shiira 2.3 has not been tested on the latest versions of the OS, and has been reported to be buggy on Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6. The final release for Mac OS X 10.3 was 1.2.2.

Nuclear chain fibers are intrafusal fibers that, along with nuclear bag fibers, make up the muscle spindle responsible for the detection of changes in muscle length. There are 3‚Äì9 nuclear chain fibers per muscle spindle that are half the size of the nuclear bag fibers. Their nuclei are aligned in a chain and they excite the secondary nerve. They are static, whereas the nuclear bag fibers are dynamic in comparison. The name \\"nuclear chain\\" refers to the structure of the central region of the fiber, where the sensory axons wrap around the intrafusal fibers. The secondary nerve association involves an efferent and afferent pathway that measure the stress and strain placed on the muscle (usually the extrafusal fibers connected from the muscle portion to a bone). The afferent pathway resembles a spring wrapping around the nuclear chain fiber and connecting to one of its ends away from the bone. Again, depending on the stress and strain the muscles sustains, this afferent and efferent coordination will measure the \\"stretch of the spring\\" and communicate the results to the central nervous system. A similar structure attaching one end to muscle and the other end to a tendon is known as a Golgi tendon organ. However, Golgi tendon organs differ from nuclear chain and nuclear bag fibers in that they are considered in series rather than in parallel to the muscle fibers. Innervation As intrafusal muscle fibers, nuclear chain fibers are innervated by both sensory afferents and motor efferents. The afferent innervation is via type Ia sensory fibers and type II sensory fibers. These project to the nucleus proprius in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Efferent innervation is via static Œ≥ motor neurons. Stimulation of Œ≥ neurons causes the nuclear chain to shorten along with the extrafusal muscle fibers. This shortening allows the nuclear chain fiber to be sensitive to changes in length while its corresponding muscle is contracted.

It has 18,576 students, according to the 2015/16 HESA student record.  History and development  Teesside University's Students' Union A shortage of funding long proved a barrier to developing the Middlesbrough-based Mechanics' Institute of 1844. With the required funding, the College's launch could have come as early as 1914. Even after the donation of ¬£40,000 to build the college from local shipping magnate Joseph Constantine in 1916, progress was slow. A Governing Council took place in 1922, followed by a doubling of the original financial offer by the Constantine family in 1924. For the task of constructing the first technical college building, Graham R. Dawbarn (a London architect also responsible for additions to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge) was appointed on 29 March 1926. Building work began in 1927, culminating in the beginning of enrolment and teaching on 16 September 1929. Constantine Technical College was formally opened on 2 July 1930 by the future King Edward VIII, the Prince of Wales. Although not yet a university, Constantine was a further and higher education college from the onset. Students at Constantine could be as young as 15. Degree courses, published in the College's prospectus were validated by the University of London. Disciplines included metallurgy, engineering and chemistry. Five rooms were also reserved for an art department, until cramped accommodation forced the School of Art to split from its parent site for the 1950s. Teesside University's Phoenix Building The 1960s were years of sweeping change ‚Äì as well as political sting ‚Äì for the still comparatively fledgling College. By the end of the decade the first two \\"Teesside University\\" campaigns had begun: the first, from the early 1960s to 1966, and the second, from 1967 to 1972. Spates of enthusiasm were killed off on each occasion by the scepticism of then-Minister of Education, Anthony Crosland, and Margaret Thatcher's defining White Paper, respectively. The latter effectively shelved plans for the erection of any new institution in the United Kingdom, until the 1980s at least. On campus, one of the most visible major developments for the College was an extension in 1963 which featured an 11-storey \\"skyscraper\\" . The College also acquired the neighbouring former High School of 1877. The College briefly restyled itself as Constantine College of Technology, before becoming Teesside Polytechnic (Britain's 13th Polytechnic) in 1969. At that point, the institution ran seventeen degree courses. A merger with Teesside College of Education took place in the 1970s along with the purchase of Flatts Lane. The Clarendon Building was added in 1973, as was the Stephenson Building in 1976. Both of these buildings remained in use for the Polytechnic's long- awaited conversion into a university. That happened on 16 June 1992, when Teesside Polytechnic became the University of Teesside, one of the UK's first new universities following that year's Further and Higher Education Act. Victoria Building By the 1990s, the institution had almost 8,000 students. In 1997 the old Polytechnic's library was replaced with a Learning Resource Centre. Subsequent additions included the Virtual Reality Centre and Centre for Enterprise, and later, the Phoenix and Athena Buildings by CPMG Architects. Today, historic structures such as the old High School (the Waterhouse building), the Constantine building and Victoria Building of 1891 (a schoolyard-equipped Victorian school, housing a series of graduate business incubator units), are all Grade II listed buildings. In 2009, the University of Teesside changed its name to \\"Teesside University\\". It also changed its logo and adopted the motto \\"Inspiring success\\" as part of a ¬£20,000 rebrand. Alternative names included \\"Middlesbrough University\\" and \\"Tees Valley University\\". On 15 October 2009, Teesside was named University of the Year and awarded Outstanding Employer Engagement Initiative in the Times Higher Education Awards. In 2010, the ¬£17m Centuria South building for dental training and sports therapy was opened. This continues to provide specialist facilities. A major phase of development known as campus Heart began in 2014. This ¬£22m landmark development created a central focus to the Middlesbrough campus. It also brought the iconic building, The Curve, a new ¬£20m teaching building. As part of this ¬£280m investment period, a \\"living wall\\" was created around a giant plasma screen on the side of the University's Student Centre. In September 2017, the University unveiled a ¬£300m campus masterplan set to transform its campus across the following decade. The University was awarded a Queen's Anniversary Prize (2014‚Äì18) for outstanding work in the field of enterprise and business engagement. In 2017, Teesside University was awarded a Silver rating in the government's new Teaching Excellence Framework. In July 2017, it was reported that several professors at Teesside University in the UK have been told they must reapply for their positions over the summer or face redundancy. The university says the purpose of this is to bring all university professors under the same job title by creating a new position, rather than to save costs. Higher education policy watchers warned that this decision is part of a trend of casualising university employees. In August 2017, Teesside University was criticised for misleading adverts. It was ordered to remove claims which were in breach of Advertising Standards Authority rules by stating the University claim that it was a \\"top university in England for long-term graduate prospects\\" gave a misleading picture of the reality.  Campuses  The main entrance to Teesside University, showing the Waterhouse Building clock tower Since its formation as Constantine Technical College in 1930, Teesside University has been located in the borough of Middlesbrough in the North Yorkshire area of England on the south banks of the River Tees. Transport links exist through the A19 and A66 roads. The University's main entrance is at the site of the old Constantine College building, fronted by the Waterhouse clock tower. The University opened its original Darlington campus in the former Eastbourne Secondary School in the Eastbourne area of Darlington. A new ¬£13m Darlington campus opened in 2011 at Central Park. Today the Darlington campus is known as the Centre for Professional and Executive Development (CPED). Teesside University dance students at Temenos, close to the Middlesbrough campus Campus Heart is the latest phase of investment in the Middlesbrough campus and has seen ¬£30m of development in total. This development began in 2014 and includes the ¬£20m building, The Curve which has a 200-seat lecture theatre and of teaching and learning space. It sits within a pedestrianised and landscaped area which is seen as a focal point to the campus. In 2015, ¬£6m was invested in the refurbishment and extension of the University's Orion Building ‚Äì this includes a three-storey glass extension to house new, industry-standard equipment. It was announced in August 2015, that a further ¬£2.5m is to be invested in the award-winning Students' Union, and ¬£2m on campus catering facilities. The library is also expected to see a ¬£5m investment. A¬£2.5m health and fitness centre opened at Teesside University's Middlesbrough campus in January 2016. ¬£300m is set to be spent on the University's campus between 2017‚Äì2027. Accommodation Teesside University provides accommodation in self-catered rooms which are mostly reserved for first year undergraduate students. Accommodation is also available for international students, postgraduates, staff and undergraduates. The University has a range of managed residences (halls, houses and flats). Further places are available through the university managed housing scheme (properties owned by private landlords but managed by the University). In 2015, the university acquired Teesside Central, adding 75 en-suite apartments to its accommodation portfolio. This accommodation is known as Central Halls.  MIMA  Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art, or MIMA, is a contemporary art gallery in the centre of Middlesbrough. It is run in partnership with Teesside University.  Academic profile  Teesside University has won seven National Teaching Fellowships. The Vice-Chancellor is Professor Paul Croney, who took up the position in May 2015 when Professor Graham Henderson retired. In April 2005, the University welcomed Lord Sawyer as its Chancellor, succeeding the University's first ever Chancellor, European Commissioner Leon Brittan. Research Teesside University's research is focused on addressing five thematic areas. In research, the university offers an array of routes of study resulting in the qualification of MPhil, PhD, MProf and DProf. Students' Union The Students' Union is led by students for students with three current students elected by the student body to hold the positions of President Education, President Activities and President Welfare in March of each year. They take their posts from July to the end of June each year and have the option to seek re-election for a second and final term if they wish. The current student officer team will hold their posts until July 2019 and currently consists of Thomas Platt (President Education), Andrew Richardson (President Activities) and Sophie Bennett (President Welfare). As the officer trustees they sit on a wider board of trustees who oversee the running of the Students' Union which also includes external trustees drawn from the worlds of local government, business, charity and the public sector. The Students' Union has won numerous accolades; it was named Students' Union of the Year at the BEDA (Bar Entertainment and Dance Association) Awards in 2004 and Club Mirror Students' Union of the Year in 2002, as well as finishing runner-up in the latter award in 2007. In 2002/2003, the Students' Union also won the Sport England Volunteer Investment Programme Award, while the Union's bar, The Terrace Bar, was awarded Best Bar None status in 2006 and 2008, overcoming competition from universities from across the two regions of the North East and Yorkshire before going on to win four Best Bar None Middlesbrough Awards 2009 recognising outstanding standards of staff training and strong focus on the safety of customers. The Students' Union also won the 2007 It's Not Funny competition, winning a live comedy performance featuring Bill Bailey, Marcus Brigstocke, Andrew Maxwell and Simon Amstell. More recently the SU was shortlisted for NUS Students' Union of the Year in 2014, secured the AQS accreditation for the SU Link and gold in the National Best Bar None Awards 2015 recognising exceptional standards in its social spaces The Terrace and The Hub. From 2014 the Students' Union has received over ¬£8.5m to refurbish its building and facilities.

Their numbers vary, but often they were ten spirit- men so like the three KorybantesPausanias 5.7.6: \\"When Zeus was born, Rhea entrusted the guardianship of her son to the Dactyls of Ida, who are the same as those called Curetes.\\" or the Cabeiri that they were often interchangeable.Kerenyi, The Gods of the Greeks 1951:83-85; The Dactyls were both ancient smiths and healing magicians. In some myths, they are in Hephaestus' employ, and they taught metalworking, mathematics, and the alphabet to humans. When Ankhiale knew her time of delivery was come, she went to Psychro Cave on Cretan Mount Ida. As she squatted in labor she dug her fingers into the earth (Gaia), which brought forth these daktyloi Idaioi ( \\"Idaean fingers\\"),Argonautica, i.1122: \\"The many Daktyloi Idaioi of Crete. They were born in the Diktaion cave by the Nymph Ankhiale as she clutched the earth of Oaxos [in Krete] with both her hands.\\" thus often ten in number, or sometimes multiplied into a race of ten tens. Three is just as often given as their number. They are sometimes instead numbered as thirty-three. When Greeks offered a most solemn oath, often they would press their hands against the earth as they uttered it. Idaean Dactyls The Dactyls of Mount Ida in Crete invented the art of working metals into usable shapes with fire;Pliny the Elder. Naturalis Historia, Book 7.56.3 \\"Hesiod says that those who are called the Idaean Dactyls taught the smelting and tempering of iron in Crete\\"; the passage in Hesiod itself has not survived. Walter Burkert surmises that, as the societies of lesser gods mirrored actual cult associations, guilds of smiths corresponded to the daktyloi in real life.Burkert, Greek Religion 1985:173. According to Hesiod, they also discovered iron in Crete.Pliny the Elder. Naturalis Historia, Book 7.56.3 Commentary: \\"According to Pausanias, the art of forging iron was discovered by Glaucus of Chios. Strabo ascribes it to the Id√¶an Dactyli, and the art of manufacturing utensils of bronze and iron to the Telchines; the former were inhabitants of Crete, the latter of Rhodes.\\" Three Phrygian Dactyls, in the service of the Great Mother as Adraste (), are usually named Acmon (the anvil), Damnameneus (the hammer), and Celmis (casting). Of Celmis, Ovid (in Metamorphoses iv) made a story that when Rhea was offended at this childhood companion of Zeus, she asked Zeus to turn him to diamond-hard adamant, like a tempered blade. Zeus obliged. Later Greek attempts to justify and rationalize the relationships of Dactyls, Curetes and Corybantes were never fully successful. Strabo says of the mythographers: \\"And they suspect that both the Kouretes and the Korybantes were offspring of the Daktyloi Idaioi; at any rate, the first hundred men born in Crete were called Idaian Daktyloi, they say, and these were born of nine Kouretes, for each of these begot ten children who were called Idaian Daktyloi.\\"Strabo, Geography 10.3.22 The Cabeiri (), whose sacred place was on the island of Samothrace, were understood by Diodorus SiculusDiodorus, 5.64.4. to have been Idaean dactyls who had come west from Phrygia and whose magical practices had made local converts to their secret cult. An Idaean dactyl named Herakles (perhaps the earliest embodiment of the later hero) originated the Olympic Games by instigating a race among his four \\"finger\\" brothers. This Herakles was the \\"thumb\\"; his brothers were Aeonius (forefinger), Epimedes (middle finger), Iasus (ring finger/healing finger), and Idas or Acesidas (little finger). Rhodian Dactyls On Rhodes, Telchines were the name given to similar chthonic men, nine in number, remembered by Greeks as dangerous Underworld smiths and magicians, and multiplied into an entire autochthonous race that had reared Poseidon but had been supplanted by Apollo in his Helios role. Cretan Dactyls In Crete, three Dactyls bore names suggestive of healing: Paionios (later associated with Asclepius), Epimedes, and Iasios. It was said that they had introduced the smithing of copper and iron. Of Iasion it was told (Hesiod, Theogony 970) that he lay with Demeter, a stand-in for Rhea, in a thrice-ploughed field and the Goddess brought forth Ploutos, \\"wealth\\", in the form of a bountiful harvest. Zeus struck down this impious archaic figure with a thunderbolt. This is all of the public version of this myth that survives. Doubtless, initiates must have known more.

The university has roots back to 1860, when the Lady Byron School was founded, which later became Ealing College of Higher Education. In 1992, it became a university and 18 years later it was renamed the University of West London. West London comprises eight schools. These are Claude Littner Business School, the London Geller College of Hospitality and Tourism, the School of Computing and Engineering, London College of Music, the College of Nursing, midwifery and Healthcare, the School of Law and Criminology, the School of Human and Social Sciences, and the London School of Film, Media and Design.  History  The University of West London traces its roots back to 1860, when the Lady Byron School was founded at what is now University of West London's Ealing campus. The school later became Ealing College of Higher Education. Ealing College, founded in 1860 by Lady Byron The Slough campus was founded in January 1912 as a selective secondary school in William Street. By the 1960s, it had become Slough College of Further Education. In the 1980s it became Thames Valley College of Higher Education and in 2011 it was closed down. In 1990, Ealing College of Higher Education, Thames Valley College of Higher Education, Queen Charlotte's College of Health Care Studies and the London College of Music were merged to become the Polytechnic of West London. Two years later, the polytechnic became a university under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, and adopted the name Thames Valley University. In 2004, the university merged with Reading College and School of Arts and Design (which had been founded in 1947 as Reading Technical College). Reading College's sites at Kings Road and Crescent Road became TVU sites. Paragon Campus in Brentford (Former TVU Branding) In 2009, the university decided to divest itself of its further education courses, together with its Kings Road site, that it had inherited from the Reading College and School of Arts and Design. In 2010 the responsibility for further education, along with the Kings Road site, were transferred to a relaunched Reading College. Although some 40 miles west of London, the university retained its other sites in Reading, including the Crescent Road site that also originated with the Reading College and School of Arts and Design. In May 2009, the university announced that it would be closing its Slough campus in 2010 due to the relocation of nursing students, who make up the majority of the student body there, to Reading. Other courses will be moved to one of the university's Greater London campuses, although some part- time and nursing courses will remain in Slough at a different site. In August 2010, it was announced that the university would change its name to the University of West London, with the Privy Council subsequently granting permission for the change. The university unveiled a new logo in April 2011. Vice-Chancellor Peter John stated that the changes reflected the university's development since 1992 and new focus on its Brentford and Ealing campuses.  Campuses  There are two campus sites in western Greater London, located in St Mary's Road, Ealing and at Paragon House in Brentford. There is also a third site in Reading, Berkshire, which is some 31 miles / 50 km from the Ealing sites.Walpole House in Ealing, housing the university's administration. The University of West London has planning consent for the redevelopment of the St Mary's Road site in Ealing. The development was originally opposed by Ealing residents so a new planning permission was submitted and accepted. In 1992 the University signed an agreement to landscape the site for the community.  Organisation  The University of West London comprises eight schools. These are Claude Littner Business School, the London Geller College of Hospitality and Tourism, the School of Computing and Engineering, London College of Music, the College of Nursing, midwifery and Healthcare, the School of Law and Criminology, the School of Human and Social Sciences, and the London School of Film, Media and Design. The Graduate School (based in Ealing) co-ordinates and provides support to research activities and research degree courses. The University offers traditional Phd programmes and Professional Doctorates. The university also works with the Met Film School, a private film school that is based at Ealing Studios in London, United Kingdom. The school, which launched in 2003, offers two and three-year Bachelors programs as well as various master's degree programs, which are accredited through the University of West London.

Student life The new UWL Students' Union, opened in 2013 Students' Union The University of West London Students' Union (UWLSU) is the recognised student organisation of the University of West London. It was ranked the best student union in Greater London in 2016. The Students' Union represents the 47,000 students at all its sites. UWLSU is affiliated to the National Union of Students. The union has the ground floor of the North Building at the St. Mary's Road campus at which the Coffee Shop, Freddie's Bar and Gym are located, with a secondary site at the Paragon campus. The union aims to bring students the biggest events, ways to take up a new activities or sports, support and advice services, and a place to socialise. The official radio station for the university is Blast Radio, based on campus in 'The Heartspace'. Student accommodation The University of West London Campus at St Mary's Road, Ealing. Prior to 2006 the university operated halls of residence only at the Reading campus, although a number of private houses in the Ealing area were rented by the university and allocated to students studying there. In September 2006 the university began to offer halls of residence accommodation to students from the Ealing and Slough campuses at a student and keyworker accommodation site named Paragon. The site won the 'Major Housing Project of the Year' category at the 2007 Building awards, and is in Brentford, approximately two miles away from the Ealing campus. Paragon is home to the tallest building to be completed using Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) in the UK, which serves as a academic facility for the university's human sciences facility. The student accommodation at Paragon has been criticised by its residents for being too expensive, costing the highest of all Greater London universities' halls of residence along with SOAS in the 2007‚Äì2008 year.

It works best in low-pH products, below 4.5, where it exists as benzoic acid. Acidic foods and beverages such as fruit juice (citric acid), sparkling drinks (carbonic acid), soft drinks (phosphoric acid), and pickles (vinegar) may be preserved with potassium benzoate. It is approved for use in most countries including Canada, the U.S., and the EU, where it is designated by the E number E212. Potassium benzoate is also used in the whistle in many fireworks.Press Release from Defense Technical Information Center; article- Potassium Benzoate for Pyrotechnic Whistling Compositions: Its Synthesis and Characterization as an Anhydrous Salt  Synthesis One very common way to make potassium benzoate is by oxidizing toluene to benzoic acid followed by a neutralization with potassium hydroxide.Preparation of potassium benzoate, Another way to synthesize potassium benzoate in the lab setting is by hydrolyzing methyl benzoate with potassium hydroxide.  Mechanism of food preservation The mechanism of food preservation begins with the absorption of benzoic acid into the cell. If the intracellular pH changes to 5 or lower, the anaerobic fermentation of glucose through phosphofructokinase is decreased by 95%.  Safety and health  Potassium benzoate has low acute toxicity upon oral and dermal exposure. The Food Commission, which campaigns for safer, healthier food in the UK, describes potassium benzoate as \\"mildly irritant to the skin, eyes and mucous membranes\\"., The Food Magazine, Issue 77, Food Commission UK Cats have a significantly lower tolerance to benzoic acid and its salts than rats and mice. Under certain circumstances, such as in the presence of ascorbic acid, benzoate salts can produce benzene in soft drinks.

In quantitative verse, often used in Greek or Latin, a dactyl is a long syllable followed by two short syllables, as determined by syllable weight. In accentual verse, often used in English, it is a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables‚Äîthe opposite is the anapaest (two unstressed followed by a stressed syllable). An example of dactylic meter is the first line of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem Evangeline, which is in dactylic hexameter: :This is the / forest prim- / eval. The / murmuring / pines and the / hemlocks, The first five feet of the line are dactyls; the sixth a trochee. Stephen Fry quotes Robert Browning's The Lost Leader as an example of the use of dactylic metre to great effect, creating verse with \\"great rhythmic dash and drive\\": : Just for a handful of silver he left us : Just for a riband to stick in his coat The first three feet in both lines are dactyls. A dactyl is like a finger, having one long syllable followed by two short syllables. Another example: the opening lines of Whitman's \\"Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking\\" (1859), his poem about the birth of his poetic voice: : Out of the cradle, endlessly rocking [a dactyl, followed by a trochee ('cradle'); then another dactyl followed by a trochee ('rocking')] : Out of the mockingbird's throat, the musical shuttle [2 dactyls, then a trochee ('throat, the'); then another dactyl, followed by a trochee] : . . .

(2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 208 is a punk poet, multi instrumentalist musician and songwriter. He performs solo and as the leader of the band Barnstormer 1649, who combine early music and punk. He has performed over 3,300 concerts, published eight books of poems and an autobiography (which itself has 38 poems in it) and released over forty recordings (albums and singles). Early life Baine attended the University of Kent, Darwin College, in Canterbury between 1975 and 1978 graduating with a 2:2 degree in French and Politics.Attila the Stockbroker At Oxford Reference. Retrieved 5 June 2016 Baine took the performing name Attila the Stockbroker during a short stint as a City stockbroker's clerk between 1980 and 1981 because a colleague accused him of having the eating habits of Attila the Hun. Career Having started performing in the late 1970s after being inspired by the spirit and 'do it yourself' ethos of the punk subculture, particularly The Clash's overtly socialist stance, Baine was briefly bass player in punk bands English Disease and Brighton Riot Squad, and spent some time in 1979 in Brussels playing bass in Belgian band Contingent before going solo. (Contingent have now reformed and still gig from time to time) He did his first gig as Attila the Stockbroker at Bush Fair Playbarn, Harlow, Essex, on 8 September 1980. At first he performed poems and songs in between bands at punk rock concerts, accompanying himself on the phased electric mandolin. After this was smashed over his head by fascists during a fight at a performance in North London in May 1982, he got a mandola (a fifth lower) and has played this ever since. He refers to his mandola as \\"Nelson\\", in tribute to Nelson Mandela. He has performed in 24 countries, playing venues ranging from the Oxford Union in England to squatted punk clubs in Germany, and performs between 80 and 100 shows every year, sometimes more. He toured East Germany four times before the Berlin Wall came down, performed in a hotel in Enver Hoxha's Albania and had to turn down the opportunity to perform in North Korea (at the World Festival of Youth & Students in 1989) because he was already booked to tour Canada. He was signed by Cherry Red in 1982 after recording a session for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show. He recorded a second session for Peel in 1983.\\"Attila The Stockbroker\\", Keeping It Peel, BBC, retrieved 2010-10-16 In the 1980s, he was often the support act for punk bands, including The Jam, The Alarm, Newtown Neurotics, New Model Army and performed extensively with fellow punk-inspired ranting poets Swift Nick (Nick Swift), Kool Knotes (Richard Edwards), Porky the Poet (Phill Jupitus) and Seething Wells (Steven Wells). Manic Street Preachers supported him at a performance at Swansea University. In the 1990s, alongside many other things, he toured with John Otway as Headbutts and Halibuts, and together they wrote a surreal rock opera called Cheryl, a tale of Satanism, trainspotting, drug abuse and unrequited love. He has performed at every Glastonbury Festival since 1983,at the Edinburgh Fringe on and off for 35 years, and continues to write topical, satirical material on all kinds of subjects. He puts on an annual beer and music festival 'Glastonwick', currently held at Coombes Farm, near Shoreham though originally in Southwick, his home town nearby. June 2018 saw the 23rd Glastonwick. Notable works from the 1980s include the poem \\"Contributory Negligence\\"; various Russian-themed poems, satirizing the alleged Cold War Russian threat in the context of Margaret Thatcher's Britain (such as \\"Russians in the DHSS\\" and \\"Russians in McDonald's\\"). Other political poems include the surreal Nigel series, such as \\"Nigel wants to go to C&A;\\". Later pieces include \\"Asylum Seeking Daleks\\", which satirises the right wing press's attitudes to immigration, and \\"Hey Celebrity\\", which rejects the need for the concept of celebrity. Attila the Stockbroker formed the band Barnstormer in 1994, with the initial aim of combining punk rock and early music, which they did to an extent on their debut album The Siege of Shoreham in 1996. Then Barnstormer's line up changed: they turned into a melodic punk band and for the next 22 years performed regularly across Europe, doing over 500 gigs and releasing three further albums, Just One Life (2000) Zero Tolerance (2004) and Bankers and Looters (2012). In 2018 Attila, who has always been interested in the history of the radical movements spawned in the aftermath of the English Civil War, wrote and recorded an album, Restoration Tragedy on that theme, combining early music and punk. He changed the name of the band to Barnstormer 1649 (the year of Charles 1st's execution and the revolutionary uprisings by the Levellers and Diggers). Barnstormer 1649 features Attila on vocals, mandola, violin, viola, crumhorn, cornemuse, shawm, bombarde, rauschpfeife and recorders; Jason Pegg (formerly of Clearlake) on guitar/backing vocals; M. M. McGhee on drums; Dave Cook (also of Too Many Crooks) on bass/backing vocals and Tim O'Tay on recorders. Attila now is still doing many solo shows combining his poems and songs. He has released three CDs featuring live recordings of solo gigs: Live in Belfast (2003) Live in Norway (2007) and 'Live at the Greys' (2014) His latest book of poems, 'Undaunted' was published in 2017, 'UK Gin Dependence Party and Other Peculiarities' 'in January 2014; My Poetic Licence came out in 2008. In 2010 he published a pamphlet, The Long Goodbye, containing two poems ‚Äî a long one dedicated to and chronicling the life of his mother Muriel, who died in June 2010 after a six-year battle with Alzheimer's Disease, and a shorter one written for his stepfather John Stanford, who died in December 2009. The Long Goodbye was featured on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour on Mother's Day 2011. Attila celebrated 30 years of performing in September 2010 with a 27-date tour of the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. In March 2011 he toured Australia and New Zealand for the first time in ten years, in 2012 made a return to Albania and in February 2014 toured the UK, Germany and Switzerland to promote his latest poetry book. In 2018 he performed at the Limerick Limerick Festival and continues to tour mainland Europe. On 8 September 2015, the 35th anniversary of his first gig, it saw the publication of his autobiography, Arguments Yard (35 Years of Ranting Verse and Thrash Mandola) by Cherry Red Books. In September 2016, Baine performed at the Keep Corbyn rally in Brighton in support of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. In 2017 a short documentary 35 Years A Punk Poet about Attila's performance career was produced by film maker Farouq Suleiman. Football support Baine is an supporter of Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. and for about 16 years was heavily involved in the successful battle to save the club and secure a new stadium, after the Goldstone Ground was sold to property developers in 1997. The Seagulls finally moved to their new stadium at Falmer in August 2011. He has been the team's poet in residence since 2000, and was the stadium announcer and DJ for 14 years, first at Gillingham, where the club spent two seasons playing 'home' games, and then at the club's temporary home at Withdean Stadium. As the main member of the one-off band Seagulls Ska, he had a single reach No. 17 in the UK Singles Chart in 2005, as part of the campaign for the new stadium. \\"Tom Hark (We Want Falmer)\\". On 17 August 2016, just before the start of Brighton's debut in the Premier League, he appeared in a Guardian documentary 'From nowhere to the Premier League' about the fans' role in the club's survival and resurgence On 12 August his poem on that theme, 'From Hereford To Here' was broadcast by BT Sport immediately before the coverage of their first game against Manchester City.

They differ from other eucalypts in having juvenile and adult leaves arranged in opposite pairs, sepals reduced to projections on the edge of the floral cup, four or five overlapping, more or less round petals, and a papery or thin, woody, often strongly ribbed capsule. Species are found between the Atherton Tableland in Queensland and south through New South Wales to eastern Victoria, Australia. Description Plants in the genus Angophora are trees, occasionally shrubs, with rough bark except for A. costata. The juvenile leaves differ from adult leaves in being hairy with raised oil glands. Both juvenile and adult leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, the adult leaves usually glabrous and paler on the lower surface. The flower buds are arranged in groups of three or seven. The flower has four or five small sepals, reduced to small projections on the rim of the floral cup. There are four or five more or less round, keeled, overlapping petals and whorls of many creamy white stamens. Unlike in Eucalyptus and Corymbia, the petals and sepals are not fused to form a cap- like operculum. The fruit is a papery or thin, slightly woody, hairy capsule with longitudinal ribs. Taxonomy The genus Angophora was first formally described in 1797 by Antonio Jos√© Cavanilles in his book Icones et Descriptiones Plantarum. Angophora is closely related to Corymbia and Eucalyptus, and all three genera are often referred to as \\"eucalypts\\". Collectively the eucalypts dominate many Australian ecosystems.Eucalyptus, Corymbia and Angophora. Australian Native Plants Society.Eucalyptus, Corymbia and Angophora - Background. Australian Native Plants Society. Taxonomists have long recognised the relationships between the eucalypt taxa, but have not agreed upon a classification scheme.

Harold, his brother David, and four sisters, Anne, Bertha, Gladys and Grace, grew up in Swampscott and attended Swampscott schools. In high school, Harold was an outstanding athlete and developed his passion for sports. Founding Dexter Shoes After graduating from high school in 1934, Alfond got a job at Kesslen Shoe Company in Kennebunk, Maine, where his father worked. In a short time, he rose from odd shoe boy to factory superintendent. In 1940, Alfond and his father bought a shoe factory in Norridgewock, Maine, and founded Norrwock Shoe Company. They sold the company to Shoe Corp. of America in 1943 and Alfond stayed on as president for 25 years. In 1956, Alfond left, purchased an old woolen mill in Dexter, Maine, and founded Dexter Shoe Company. There, he produced shoes for the private label catalog market, supplying stores such as Sears, JC Penney, Spiegel, and Montgomery Ward & Co.. Although Dexter was successful from the beginning, Alfond tired of being controlled by a few large customers and decided to go into the \\"branded\\" business. He developed a line of shoes under the Dexter name, hired a sales force and began selling to independent shoe stores across the country. Alfond is often credited with the invention of the factory outlet store. Because factories make mistakes, not all shoes come out as first grade. The mistakes are called FDs (factory damaged). The practice in the industry was to sell these FDs to jobbers for about a dollar a pair, who would then resell them for five times their cost. Alfond thought that was a pretty good mark-up, so in the 1960s he opened an outlet store at Dexter's Skowhegan factory and started selling his own FDs. Soon, the factories weren't making enough mistakes to supply the store, so Harold decided to put in stale inventory (first grade shoes that weren't selling in the wholesale market). This worked so well that Dexter's log-cabin- style outlet stores started popping up on all the heavily traveled roads throughout New England. Other manufacturers caught on to the idea and as Dexter put up new stores, other manufacturers would open their outlets next door. By the 1990s, the Dexter Factory Outlet chain had expanded to over 80 stores. About this time, Dexter also stopped building freestanding log cabins and began leasing stores in outlet malls. Dexter continued to grow rapidly throughout the 1970s and 1980s and from time to time, corporate suitors came calling to see whether they could entice Dexter into a marriage. Many were national retail chains that promised rapid expansion, but would emphasize foreign production and likely, a departure from Dexter's family style of running the business. Alfond eventually decided to sell to Berkshire Hathaway, with an agreement to not interfere with the family's continued management of the business. In 1993, Dexter and its affiliates, Pan Am Shoe and Ocsap Ltd., were sold for $433 million in stock; eight years later Warren Buffett decided to fold Dexter into another business, admitting in 2008 that it was \\"the worst deal that I've made.\\" Philanthropy In order to coordinate his charitable giving, the 36-year-old Alfond organized the first private foundation in the state of Maine, the Harold Alfond Foundation. Between 1950 and 2003, the foundation has contributed more than $100 million to charitable causes, and as of 2008 had over $106 million in assets. He has donated money to various institutions of learning to help improve their sports facilities; for example, the Alfond Arena and Alfond Stadium at the University of Maine, the Harold and Ted Alfond Sports Center at Rollins College, the Harold Alfond Center for Health Sciences and the Alfond Forum at the University of New England, the Harold Alfond Management Center at the University of Massachusetts Amherst's Isenberg School, and the Alfond Center at Saint Joseph's College of Maine. In December 2003, five years after his $1.65-million donation for the athletic and recreation center, Alfond contributed $1 million to St. Joseph's towards the $10 million needed to build Alfond Hall, the college's primary academic hall. Harold Alfond and the Alfond Foundation have also been major supporters of Kents Hill School in Readfield, Maine. Kents Hill opened the Alfond Athletics Center in 2001 and the Alfond Athletic Fields - the largest turf complex in New England - in 2008 after receiving substantial gifts. In 2011, Kents Hill received a $2.3 million gift for the construction of its Akin Learning Center. Most recently in 2015, the school received a $3.5 million matching grant for the construction of a new dining hall. In 2007, having lived with cancer for 17 years, Alfond donated $7 million to a cancer care center at MaineGeneral Medical Center in Augusta. The center is named the Harold Alfond Center for Cancer Care. The Alfond Scholarship Foundation introduced the \\"Harold Alfond College Challenge\\" in January 2009. Through the program, a $500 grant is given to every Maine resident who is enrolled before his or her first birthday; the money is intended to help Maine families plan for education beyond high school. As of July 2010, 5,500 babies have been enrolled in the program. Investments in sports In addition to his donations to colleges for improvements to their sports facilities, Alfond demonstrated his support of sports in other ways. In 1978, a group purchasing the Boston Red Sox was looking for a Maine sportsman to join them. Alfond was the obvious choice and ever since Dexter has been a limited partner in the franchise. When Dexter was sold to Berkshire Hathaway in 1993, the Alfond family retained its stake in the team, a stake that remains in the hands of two of his sons. In the 1980s, Alfond helped sponsor Kevin Mahaney in the sailor's effort to compete in the Olympics. Mahaney later earned a silver medal in sailing at the 1992 Summer Olympics. Along with other investors, Alfond helped create Belgrade Lakes Golf Club, a course close to his summer home. The club has been recognized as among the best public golf courses in the country. In 2002, Golf Digest recognized the course as the only five-star public golf course in the Northeast. Family life In 1943, Alfond married Dorothy Levine, who was also Jewish;Colby College Digital Commons: \\"Bibby Levine Alfond Scrapbook\\" January 1, 2011 they raised four children: Ted, Susan, Bill, and Peter who grew to provide them with thirteen grandchildren. Dorothy Alfond died in December 2005. One of the grandsons, Justin Alfond, was elected to the Maine Senate in 2008, and was elected Senate President in 2012.

In her work with Enough is Enough, Hughes has appeared on a variety of outlets as an Internet safety advocate. She first became known as a key figure in a widely publicized 1987 political scandal that contributed to the end of the second campaign of former Senator Gary Hart for the Democratic Party nomination for President. Personal life Rice grew up in the Irmo area near Columbia, South Carolina. Rice attended the University of South Carolina, where she was a cheerleader and a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society and graduated with a Bachelors of Science degree in biology. Donna Rice is married to Jack Hughes and has two grown step-children, Sean and Mindy, and three grandchildren. Rice has openly said she was a victim of date rape \\"on the way to New York City by an older man who was involved with the pageant system, and lost my virginity at that time\\". She says the rape was \\"the turning point in my life, the catalyst that propelled me further into an unhealthy lifestyle\\". Career After she graduated from college, she entered the Miss South Carolina World beauty pageant and won.Alan Richman, Donna Rice: 'The Woman in Question , People Magazine (Vol. 27, No. 20, May 18, 1987) She went to New York to compete nationally. Rice later moved to Miami, where she worked as a marketing representative for pharmaceutical giant Wyeth Laboratories in South Florida. She also worked as a television commercial actress and appeared in a 1986 episode of the TV series Miami Vice as well as an episode of the soap opera One Life to Live, and played a secretary in the movie The Last Plane Out. Advocacy Since 1994, when she became communications director and spokesperson for Enough Is Enough, an American secular nonpartisan non-profit organization whose mission is to make the Internet safer for families and children, Hughes has been an advocate and speaker on the issue of protecting children online. Hughes became president and CEO of the organization in 2002. The organization has produced an Internet Safety 101SM program with the Department of Justice and other partners. She is the executive producer, host and instructor of the Internet Safety 101 DVD series, which ran as a TV series on PBS, garnering Hughes an Emmy nomination in 2012 and the series an Emmy Award in 2013. Hughes has appeared on The Today Show and other national broadcasts including the Oprah Winfrey Show, CNN, Dateline NBC, and has been interviewed by Barbara Walters on numerous occasions. Hughes has testified before multiple congressional hearings on protecting children online. Hughes and Enough Is Enough supported the Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996, the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), and the Child Online Protection Act (COPA). She was appointed by Senator Trent Lott to serve on the COPA Commission and served as co-chair of the COPA Hearings on filtering/ratings/labeling technologies. She also serves on various Internet safety advisory boards and task forces including the 2006 Virginia Attorney General's Youth Internet Safety Task Force and the 2008 Internet Safety Technical Task Force, formed with MySpace and the U.S. Attorneys General. Beyond addressing the dangers of Internet pornography, Hughes has also spoken into the issue of privacy online, teen suicide and the impact of cyberbullying. She has received numerous awards including the National Law Center for Children and Families Annual Appreciation Award, and the \\"Protector of Children Award\\" and Media Impact Award from the National Abstinence Clearinghouse. Most recently, Hughes received the 2013 Women in Technology Leadership Award for \\"Social Impact.\\" In the fall of 2014, the group's \\"National Porn Free Wi-Fi\\" campaign\\" encouraged McDonald's and Starbucks to add filters to block pornography on their Wi-Fi networks. In 2016, McDonald's implemented their filtered Wi-Fi policy in the majority of their 14,000 stores. Starbucks followed suit nationally and announced they would implement a global policy as well. That same year, she won the 2014 Professional Women in Advocacy Excellence In Advocacy Award for ‚ÄúVeteran Practitioner.‚Äù Enough Is Enough sponsored a \\"Children's Internet Safety Presidential Pledge\\" in 2016, asking presidential candidates to pledge to combat both Internet pornography‚Äîincluding both illegal child pornography and legal adult pornography‚Äîif elected president.Craig Hlavaty, Donald Trump says he will crack down on internet porn while in office , Houston Chronicle (August 1, 2016). The Pledge states that if elected President of the United States of America, [the pledging person] promises to \\"uphold the rule of law by aggressively enforcing existing federal laws to prevent the sexual exploitation of children online, including the federal obscenity laws, child pornography laws, sexual predation laws and the sex trafficking laws.\\" Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump signed the pledge, and Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton sent a letter of support. During a period of national political divide following the presidential election, Hughes launched Enough Is Enough's \\"High Road Campaign\\" confronting the global epidemic of hate and cyberbullying by promoting civility, common decency and kindness. The campaign's efforts included Hughes' hour-long C-SPAN interview and her op-ed on CNN.com titled \\"Cruel attacks on Melania Trump obscure her positive role\\" in support of Melania Trump's cyberbullying platform which had one million readers and 850 comments in the first 24 hours. Hughes has publicly spoken against articles appearing in Teen Vogue magazine for promoting sexual activity of any kind to teens, sparking an online petition her organization initiated called ‚ÄúSay No To Teen Vogue‚Äù after it published Anal Sex: What You Need to Know/How to Do it the Right Way. The petition has generated more than 29,000 signatures calling to \\"boycott Teen Vogue until this article is retracted and these types of articles cease to be published.\\" In October 2017, Hughes participated as one of 120 world leaders in the area of Internet safety in Rome, Italy for the \\"Child Dignity In the Digital World\\" World Congress to set the global agenda in the fight against child sexual abuse and exploitation in the digital age. The Congress concluded with a papal audience at the Vatican in which Pope Francis applauded the Congress in his address for concentrating with great foresight \\"on what is probably the most crucial challenge for the future of the human family-the protection of young people's dignity, their healthy development, their joy and their hope.\\" In November 2017, Hughes joined Candy Carson and others at the invitation of Homemakers for America for the grand opening of the Museum of the Bible in Washington D.C. to ring the replica of the Liberty Bell, launching a nationwide ringing of bells by churches to calling Americans to come together to ‚ÄúLet Freedom Ring!‚Äù In March 2018, Hughes joined others from the Moms March Movement to speak at a press conference organized by the HomeMakers for America, in Washington D.C. to share the Declaration of Mothers reclaiming culture for truth, family, and freedom. The event also proclaimed March 8 as International Mother's Influence Day and launched ‚ÄúA Day With a Mother.‚Äù Under her leadership at Enough Is Enough, Hughes rolled out a Random Posts of Kindness campaign designed to generate a culture of dignity and respect in order to create a safer, more civil Internet. The campaign includes a special initiative, Sweet Tweets.  Writing  She co-wrote the story for the May 2000 season finale episode of Touched by an Angel that dealt with online safety. She authored the book Kids Online: Protecting Your Children in Cyberspace and website ProtectKids.com. As a platform issue of Enough Is Enough, she has written and spoken regularly on the harms of online bullying, the relational brokenness of young people, and the need for a safer, kinder and ethical community on and offline. Hughes was an outspoken supporter of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign. She has also written numerous commentaries that have been published in the L.A. Times, USA Today, Politico, CNN, FOX News and other media outlets. Hughes has called upon The Walt Disney Company to crack down on unauthorized \\"Disney porn\\" on the Internet.  Professional speaking  She has spoken on the subject of Internet dangers, safety, and cybersecurity in educational and professional forums including: keynotes at the White House, University of Houston Law School, MIT, Johns Hopkins University, the Media Institute, the Freedom Forum, and the National Press Club. She also conducted a seminar at the request of AG John Ashcroft, at the Department of Justice's Federal Prosecutors' Obscenity Symposium. Hughes told a group of women attending the \\"Mom's March across America\\" event in September 2017 that \\"A culture of human dignity and mutual respect has made this nation strong even in the most turbulent of times in our history.\\"  Involvement in political scandal  Rice met former Senator Gary Hart at a 1986-87 New Year's Eve Party at the Aspen, Colorado home of her then boyfriend, rocker Don Henley. Rice later met Hart in Miami, and stated that she was \\"very interested in getting into fund raising\\". Soon after meeting Rice, Hart announced that he would run for the nomination as the Democratic candidate for president. Having enjoyed a surprisingly strong campaign in 1984 against the eventual nominee, former Vice President Walter Mondale, he was widely perceived as a front-runner for the Democratic nomination in 1988. Shortly thereafter rumors began circulating about his being a \\"womanizer\\", leading the candidate to invite the media to observe his public behavior, and to also claim that anybody who did so would \\"be very bored.\\"Maureen Dowd, \\"Liberties; Change of Hart\\", New York Times, March 22, 1998 However, he never intended to invite reporters to be \\"skulking around in the shadows\\" of his home. In a controversial move, reporters for the Miami Herald stalked Rice on a flight from Miami to Washington, D.C., then staked out Hart's townhouse following a phone call from someone trying to sell pictures from the trip. There, the Herald 's Jim McGee saw Hart and Rice return to Hart's townhouse. The Herald then reported that Rice had spent the night at Hart's residence, but later conceded that they had not watched the back door, which she may have left by. Their story was published on the same day that his quotation appeared in The New York Times Magazine. The ensuing report sent the media into frenzy. While Hart contended that the reporters could have no knowledge of exactly when Rice arrived or why she was there, Rice declared the association had been innocent, and denied that she had slept at Hart's house, or that the relationship was sexual. Hart also denied the accuracy of the story. Hart's popular appeal nevertheless suffered, and polls taken almost immediately afterward found him to be 10 points behind Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis in New Hampshire. On May 8, 1987, a week after the story broke, Hart suspended his campaign after the Washington Post threatened to run a story about a woman Hart had dated while separated from his wife,David Johnston for the New York Times. 7 June 1987 Hart's Link to 2d Woman was Found by a Private Detective and his wife and daughter became similar subjects of interest for tabloid newspapers.Matt Bai. All The Truth Is Out: The Week That Politics Went Tabloid. Knopf (September 30, 2014) Monkey Business photo On the cover of its June 2, 1987 edition, the celebrity tabloid National Enquirer published a photograph of Rice sitting on Hart's lap. The pair were pictured on a dock during a yacht trip to Bimini that Hart, Rice and others took before he announced his campaign for President of the United States. Hart is wearing a T-shirt bearing the words Monkey Business, the name of the yacht. The photo was published alongside the headline \\"Gary Hart Asked Me to Marry Him\\". It was published weeks after Hart suspended his campaign, but has been subsequently collectively confused as the reason for Hart's exit. There are allegations that the photo was a set up by Republican operative Lee Atwater to discredit Hart. Both Rice and Hart have consistently denied that their relationship was sexual and have stated they were just friends. The scandal is depicted in the 2018 film The Front Runner, with Rice played by Sara Paxton. Aftermath The enormous publicity generated by the Hart scandal resulted in numerous lucrative offers, and while Rice refused most ‚Äì including one for an interview with Playboy magazine, an ABC movie of the week, book and magazine offers ‚Äì she did appear in 1987 as the No Excuses jeans girl in commercials and advertisements for No Excuses jeans. She said, \\"A month after the scandal broke, I tried to go back to work at the pharmaceutical company after a leave of absence. But because of all the publicity and resulting pressure and stress, I finally resigned.\\" A month after the scandal broke, she began reconnecting with her Christian faith and then disappeared from the public eye for seven years. Rice lived in Los Angeles briefly, then moved to the Washington, D.C. suburbs in Northern Virginia in the early 1990s. There Rice married Jack Hughes, a businessman, in May 1994.

In 1951 it was joined with Bia≈Ça Krakowska to form the new town of Bielsko-Bia≈Ça. Bielsko constitutes the western part of that town. Bielsko was founded by the Cieszyn Piast dukes in the late 13th century on the grounds of village later called Stare Bielsko (Old Bielsko), on the Bia≈Ça River. It was first mentioned in a written document in 1312. Originally settled by Germans, it became the largest German- language center (Deutsche Sprachinsel Bielitz) in the Duchy of Teschen, and remained so until the end of World War II. In 1572 it gained autonomy as the Duchy (State) of Bielsko. During the 18th century a rapid development of textile industry occurred, and at the beginning of the 19th century more than 500 weavers worked in the town.Jedlecki 2008, 50. After the 1920 division of Cieszyn Silesia between Poland and Czechoslovakia it became, despite the protests of local Germans, a part of Poland. According to the Austrian census of 1910 the town had 18,568 inhabitants. The census asked people for their native language: 15,144 (84.3%) were German-speaking, 2,568 (14.3%) were Polish-speaking and 136 (0.7%) were Czech-speaking. Jews were not allowed to declare Yiddish, and most of them thus declared German as their native language. The most populous religious groups were Roman Catholics with 10,378 (55.9%), followed by Protestants with 4,955 (26.7%) and the Jews with 3,024 (16.3%).Ludwig Patryn (ed): Die Ergebnisse der Volksz√§hlung vom 31.

The vast majority of the Jews were exterminated by Nazis during World War II, and the German population was expelled by the Soviets after the war under the terms demanded by Stalin at the Potsdam Conference. Three well-known Holocaust survivors from Bielsko are Kitty Hart-Moxon, Roman Frister and Gerda Weissmann Klein. All three have written autobiographies and other works about their experiences during the Second World War.

He was most notable for his service in the United States House of Representatives from 1795 to 1799. Life Williams was born in Barnstaple, Devonshire, England in September 1752. He received a liberal education, studied medicine and surgery in St. Thomas' Hospital, London, and served for one year as surgeon‚Äôs mate on an English man-of-war. He immigrated to America in 1773 and settled in New Perth, Charlotte County, New York (now Salem, Washington County), where he engaged in an extensive medical practice. He married Susanna (Thomas) Turner, and they had four children. After the death of his first wife, he married Mrs. Mary Townley. Williams was a member of the New York Provincial Congress in 1775; he was reelected and served until its dissolution in 1777. He was appointed surgeon of state militia forces in 1775. Williams was a named colonel of the Charlotte County militia regiment in 1776 and retained command throughout the Revolutionary War. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1777 to 1779 when he was expelled for fraud and theft. One act of which he was accused was the submission of false muster and payrolls, which enabled him to draw government money for paying soldiers, but which he then kept. He was also accused of holding of courts-martial which were not authorized by militia regulations and fining soldiers who were found guilty, after which he withheld their salaries to pay the fines. He was later exonerated and resumed his political and military careers. He was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1781 and 1782, and again a member of the New York State Senate from 1782 to 1794. Williams was appointed a member of the first board of regents of the University of the State of New York in 1784. He served as brigadier general of militia in 1786. During 1788 when the American people were debating whether their states should ratify the proposed Constitution of the United States, Williams was an Anti-Federalist, meaning that he opposed the proposed Constitution.Young, Alfred. The Democratic Republicans of New York: The Origins, 1763-1797, p. 422 (UNC Press Books, 2012).

Williams was subsequently a delegate to the State ratification convention in 1788, where the Anti-Federalists failed to stop the Constitution, but succeeded in obtaining assurances that a Bill of Rights would be added. He was a member of the Council of Appointment in 1789.

Ryerson Review of Journalism, March 16, 2007. Background Linehan was born in Hamilton, Ontario in 1944, one of seven children. His estranged Irish father, Les, worked at one of the local steel mills, Dofasco; and his Serbian mother, Sava (n√©e Kotur), was later remarried to a post World War II Serbian immigrant, Jovan Rodic Sr. He too, was a steel worker. At age 19, Linehan moved to Toronto, taking an entry-level job with Odeon Cinemas.\\"BOOKS: Starring Brian Linehan by George Anthony\\". Daily Xtra, October 14, 2007. The following year, he began working in public relations as an organizer of celebrity promotional visits to Toronto. By 1968, he was the general manager of Janus Films, a film distribution company. Career He joined Citytv in 1973 as the host of City Lights, a program which would eventually become syndicated throughout Canada and the United States. Linehan was renowned for his composure, interview skills and meticulous research, often leading to in-depth questions that could last for minutes. His guests often responded to his questions with astonishment at his depth of knowledge; actress Shirley MacLaine once commented that the stars flocked to Toronto \\"so Brian could tell us about our lives\\".

Through the 1970s, the couple also had a sideline business renovating and reselling houses. They remained together until Wagman's death by suicide in 2002; however, Linehan was very guarded about his personal life, acknowledging only to his closest friends and never publicly that Wagman was anything more than a platonic roommate. Linehan was diagnosed with non- Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2001 and died in 2004. His ashes were scattered outside the Toronto home he had shared with Wagman, although Joan Rivers kept a small portion of them as a memento of him.

The refugees tried to disembark in Cuba but were denied permission to land. The captain, Gustav Schr√∂der, went to the United States and Canada, trying to find a nation to take the Jews in, but both nations refused. He finally returned the ship to Europe, where various countries, including the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands and France, accepted some refugees. Many were later caught in Nazi roundups of Jews in the occupied countries of Belgium, France and the Netherlands, and some historians have estimated that approximately a quarter of them were killed in death camps during World War II. These events, also known as the \\"Voyage of the Damned\\", have inspired film, opera, and fiction. Background St. Louis was a diesel-powered passenger ship properly referred to with the prefix MS or MV, built by the Bremer Vulkan shipyards in Bremen for HAPAG, better known in English as the Hamburg America Line. The ship was named after the city of St. Louis, Missouri. Her sister ship, , was also a diesel powered motor vessel owned by the Hamburg America Line. St. Louis regularly sailed the trans-Atlantic route from Hamburg to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and New York City, and made cruises to the Canary Islands, Madeira, Spain; and Morocco. St. Louis was built for both transatlantic liner service and for leisure cruises. The \\"Voyage of the Damned\\" The St. Louis vessel set sail from Hamburg to Cuba on May 13, 1939 under command of Captain Gustav Schr√∂der, carrying 973 passengers, most of them Jewish refugeesRosen, p. 563. seeking asylum from Nazi persecution in Germany. Captain Schr√∂der was a German who went to great lengths to ensure dignified treatment for his passengers.Levine, p. 105. Food served included items subject to rationing in Germany, and childcare was available while parents dined. Dances and concerts were put on, and on Friday evenings, religious services were held in the dining room. A bust of Hitler was covered by a tablecloth. Swimming lessons took place in the pool. Lothar Molton, a boy traveling with his parents, said that the passengers thought of it as \\"a vacation cruise to freedom\\".Levine, pp. 110‚Äì11. Bound for Cuba, the ship dropped anchor at 04:00 on May 27 at the far end of the Havana Harbor but was denied entry to the usual docking areas. The Cuban government, headed by President Federico Laredo Br√∫, refused to accept the foreign refugees, although holding legal tourist visas to Cuba, as laws related to these had been recently changed. On May 5, 1939, four months before World War II began, Havana abandoned its pragmatic immigration policy, by virtue of Decree 937, which \\"restricted entry of all foreigners except U.S. citizens, unless authorized by Cuban secretaries of state subject a bond of US $500.-\\".Levine, p. 103 None of the passengers knew that their landing permits were invalidated retroactively. After the ship had been in the harbour for five days, only 28 passengers were allowed to disembark in Cuba.Levine, p. 114. Twenty-two were Jews who had valid United States visas; four were Spanish citizens and two were Cuban nationals, all with valid entry documents. The last admitted was the medical evacuee, a desperate passenger who attempted a suicide, and was allowed hospitalization in Havana. Hamburg Harbor Records show American officials Cordell Hull, Secretary of State and Henry Morgenthau, Secretary of the Treasury had made efforts to persuade Cuba to accept the refugees, quite like the failed attempts by the American Jewish \\"Joint\\" Distribution Committee, which pleaded with the government. After most passengers were refused landing in Cuba, Captain Schr√∂der directed St. Louis and the remaining 907 refugees towards the United States. He circled off the coast of Florida, hoping for permission from authorities to enter the United States. Cordell Hull advised Franklin Roosevelt, president of the US, not to accept the Jews. Captain Schr√∂der considered running aground along the coast to allow the refugees to escape but, acting on Cordell Hull's instructions, United States Coast Guard vessels shadowed the ship and prevented this. After St. Louis was turned away from the United States, a group of academics and clergy in Canada tried to persuade Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to provide sanctuary to the passengers. The ship could have reached Halifax, Nova Scotia in two days. The director of Canada's Immigration Branch, Frederick Blair, was hostile to Jewish immigration and persuaded the head of government on June 9 not to intervene. In 2000, Blair's nephew apologized to the Jewish people for his uncle's action. As Captain Schr√∂der negotiated and schemed to find passengers a haven, conditions on the ship declined. At one point he made plans to wreck the ship on the British coast to force the government to take in the passengers as refugees. He refused to return the ship to Germany until all the passengers had been given entry to some other country. US officials worked with Britain and European nations to find refuge for the Jews in Europe. The ship returned to Europe, docking at the Port of Antwerp (Belgium) on June 17, 1939, with the 908 passengers.George Axelsson, \\"907 Refugees End Voyage in Antwerp\\", New York Times, 18 June 1939Levine, p. 118. The British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain agreed to take 288 (32 percent) of the passengers, who disembarked and travelled to the UK via other steamers. After much negotiation by Schr√∂der, the remaining 619 passengers were also allowed to disembark at Antwerp. 224 (25 percent) were accepted by France, 214 (23.59 percent) by Belgium, and 181 (20 percent) by the Netherlands. The ship returned to Hamburg without any passengers. The following year, after the Battle of France, and the Nazi occupations of Belgium, France, and the Netherlands in May 1940, all the Jews in those countries were subject to high risk, including the recent refugees.Rosen, pp. 103, 567. Belgian officials in the Port of Antwerp. Based on the survival rates for Jews in various countries during the war and deportations, historians have estimated that 180 of St. Louis refugees in France, 152 of those in Belgium and 60 of those in the Netherlands survived the Holocaust. Including the passengers who landed in England, of the original 936 refugees (one man died during the voyage), roughly 709 survived the war and 227 died.Rosen, pp. 447, 567 citing Morgan-Witts and Thomas (1994) pp. 8, 238 Later research tracing each passenger has determined that 254 [29.2 percent] of those who returned to continental Europe were murdered during the Holocaust. Legacy After the war, the Federal Republic of Germany awarded Captain Gustav Schr√∂der the Order of Merit. In 1993, Schr√∂der was posthumously named as one of the Righteous among the Nations at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Israel. A display at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC tells the story of the voyage of the MS St. Louis. The Hamburg Museum features a display and a video about St. Louis ship in its exhibits about the history of shipping in the city. In 2009, a special exhibit at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia, entitled Ship of Fate, explored the Canadian connection to the tragic voyage. The display is now a traveling exhibit in Canada.\\"Traveling Exhibit: MS St. Louis Ship of Fate\\" , Maritime Museum of the Atlantic In 2011 a memorial monument called the Wheel of Conscience, was produced by the Canadian Jewish Congress, designed by Daniel Libeskind with graphic design by David Berman and Trevor Johnston.Studio Daniel Libeskind , daniel-libeskind.com, 19 January 2011; retrieved 21 January 2011. The memorial is a polished stainless steel wheel. Symbolizing the policies that turned away more than 900 Jewish refugees, the wheel incorporates four inter-meshing gears, each showing a word to represent factors of exclusion: antisemitism, xenophobia, racism, and hatred. The back of the memorial is inscribed with the passenger list. It was first exhibited in 2011 at the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21, Canada's national immigration museum in Halifax. After a display period, the sculpture was shipped to its fabricators, Soheil Mosun Limited, in Toronto for repair and refurbishment.\\"Exhibitions\\", Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21, pier21.ca; accessed 12 September 2014. In 2012, the United States Department of State formally apologized in a ceremony attended by Deputy Secretary Bill Burns and 14 survivors of the incident. The survivors presented a proclamation of gratitude to various European countries for accepting some of the ship's passengers. A signed copy of Senate Resolution 111, recognizing June 6, 2009 as the 70th anniversary of the incident, was delivered to the Department of State Archives. In May 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the Government of Canada would offer a formal apology in the country's House of Commons for its role in the fate of the ship's passengers. The apology was issued on November 7, 2018. Later career MS St. Louis was adapted as a German naval accommodation ship from 1940 to 1944. She was heavily damaged by the Allied bombings at Kiel on August 30, 1944. The ship was repaired and used as a hotel ship in Hamburg in 1946. She was later sold and was scrapped in 1952.

Armstrong said they were revealed to him by God during his study of the Bible.Mystery of the Ages, pp. 7‚Äì30 The term Armstrongite is sometimes used to refer to those that follow Armstrong's teachings. Armstrongism and Armstrongite are generally considered derogatory by those to whom it is applied, who prefer to be known as members of the Church of God (COG). These doctrines were also espoused by his sons Richard David Armstrong (until his death in 1958) and Garner Ted Armstrong (until his death in 2003) with slight variations. Herbert Armstrong's teachings have similarities to those of the Millerites and Church of God (Seventh Day) (sometimes referred to as \\"COG7\\" to differentiate it from similarly-styled sects named \\"Church of God\\" which worship on Sunday and generally hold to traditional Christian teachings), from which WCG is spiritually and organizationally descended. The religion is a blend of Christian fundamentalism, non-belief in the Trinity and some tenets of Judaism and Seventh-Day Sabbath doctrine. weburl=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/17/obituaries/herbert- armstrong-93-dies-evangelist-and-a-broadcaster.html Armstrong himself had been a COG7 minister before the Oregon conference stripped him of his ministerial credentials and excommunicated him for his seeking to water down and change their long established COG7 doctrines. It was in the fall of 1937 when Elder Armstrong's credentials were revoked by the Salem Church of God organization. The reason given by the Board of Twelve Oregon Conference of the Church of God, 7th Day (COG7) for this adverse action against Herbert W. Armstrong, was because he taught and kept the annual Feast days. But the real reason seems to have been because of his bad attitude.weburl=http://www.exitsupportnetwork.com/mike_ep/exam/kiesz.htm#It%20was%20in%20the%20fall Armstrong then began his own ministry. Armstrong taught that most of the basic doctrines and teachings of mainstream Christianity were based on traditions, including absorbed pagan concepts and rituals (i.e. religious syncretism), rather than the Judeo-Christian Bible. His teachings have consequently been the source of much controversy. Shortly after Armstrong's death in 1986, the Worldwide Church of God started revising its core beliefs towards the concepts, doctrines, and creeds of mainstream Christianity. This resulted in many ministers and members leaving the WCG to start or join other churches, many of which continue to believe and teach Armstrong's doctrines to one degree or another. Eventually, the WCG changed its name in 2009 to Grace Communion International (GCI). Today, the official doctrinal position of GCI is mainstream evangelical, although there are still GCI ministers and members who do not fully embrace all of the changes. Doctrinal differences Some of Armstrong's identifiable doctrines are in addition to or are different from traditional mainstream Christian doctrines. Many groups and churches which splintered in the aftermath of doctrinal changes within the Worldwide Church of God continue to hold many or all of these teachings of Armstrong. God Family The God Family doctrine holds that the Godhead is not limited to God (the Creator) alone, or even to a trinitarian God, but is a divine family into which every human who ever lived may be spiritually born, through a master plan being enacted in stages. The Godhead now temporarily consists of two co- eternal individuals (see Binitarianism), Jesus the Messiah, as the creator and spokesman (The Word or Logos), and God the Father. According to this doctrine, humans who are called by God's Holy Spirit to repentance, who [accept], hope to inherit, the gift of eternal life made possible by Jesus' sacrifice, who commit to live by \\"every word of God\\" (i.e. biblical scripture), and who \\"endure to the end\\" (i.e. remain faithful to live according to God's way of life until either the end of their own lifetime or the second coming of Jesus) would, at Jesus' return, be \\"born again\\" into the family of God as the literal spiritual offspring or children of God. Armstrong drew parallels between every stage of human reproduction and this spiritual reproduction. He often stated that \\"God is reproducing after his own kind‚Äî children in his own image.\\" Whatever the changes brought about by this new entrance of humans into God's family, God the Father will always be the omnipotent sovereign and sustainer of both the universe and the spiritual realm, forever to be worshipped as God by the children of God. Jesus, as the creator of the universe and savior of God's children, will always rule the Kingdom of God, which will ultimately grow to fill the entire universe, and he likewise will forever be worshipped as God by the children of God. Church authority Armstrong taught the Bible (excluding the Biblical apocrypha and deuterocanonical books) is the authoritative Word of God (The Proof of the Bible). He taught that the Bible, while inerrant in its message, had been distorted through many conflicting interpretations, and it was not until the 20th century that God had restored the full Gospel message of the Kingdom of God, as understood by the original apostles, to the Church through him (Armstrong) by opening his mind to the plain truth of scripture. Armstrong taught that all other churches calling themselves \\"Christian\\" were not merely apostate, but actually counterfeits whose history could be traced back to the first century, as described in the epistles (which refer to a \\"false gospel\\" and \\"false ministers\\" and \\"false apostles\\"), the eighth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles (the appropriation of \\"Christian\\" trappings by influential and ambitious pagan religious figures [including a man known to secular history, Simon Magus, mentioned in Acts]) and later historians like Eusebius. Sabbatarianism and Old Testament beliefs The observance of the Sabbath from dusk on Friday to dusk on Saturday was the first non-traditional religious practice (as compared to mainstream Christianity). Armstrong wrote in several of his books that his wife, Loma, after she met a member of a Sabbatarian church group (the Church of God (Seventh-Day)), challenged him to prove to her from scripture that, as Herbert claimed, Sunday was the proper day for Christian worship. After months of Bible study, Armstrong decided that there was no sound scriptural authority for Christian worship on Sunday, but rather asserted that the Apostles and the first generation of Christians, both Jewish and Gentile converts, continued for decades after the establishment of the Church age to set an example of observing the seventh day of the week (Friday at sunset to Saturday at sunset) as the Sabbath. Eventually, Armstrong accepted and observed many principles and laws found in the Old Testament and taught converts to do the same. These included the Ten Commandments, dietary laws, tithing, and celebration of high Sabbaths, or annual feast days such as Passover, Pentecost and the Feast of Tabernacles. Furthermore, he taught that the celebrations of Christmas and Easter were inappropriate for Christians, considering them not of biblical origin, but rather a later absorption of pagan practices into corrupted Christianity. British Israelism Armstrong was a proponent of British Israelism (also known as Anglo-Israelism), which is the doctrine that people of Western European descent, especially the British Empire (Ephraim) and the United States (Manasseh), are descended from the \\"Ten Lost Tribes\\" of Israel.The United States and Britain in Prophecy. It is also asserted that the German peoples are descended from ancient Assyrians. Armstrong believed that this doctrine provided a \\"key\\" to understanding biblical prophecy, and that he was specially called by God to proclaim these prophecies to the \\"lost tribes\\" of Israel before the coming of the \\"end-times\\". Grace Communion International, the lineal successor to Armstrong's original church, no longer teaches the doctrine, but many offshoot churches continue to teach it even though critics assert that British Israelism is inconsistent with the findings of modern genetics. Other non-mainstream teachings * God will soon set up his government on earth, under the rule of Jesus, at Jesus' Second Coming. He will rescue humanity from sin and self-annihilation, inspire mankind to voluntarily turn to God's law, and usher in a 1000 year period of peace, prosperity, and justice. Humanity will be under the rule of the children of God, who are the biblical saints and faithful members of the Worldwide Church of God, \\"born again\\" as spirit in the first resurrection, when Jesus returns to the Earth. * Non-believers are not yet eternally judged, having a future opportunity for salvation after a mortal resurrection (the second resurrection). * The vast majority of all people who have ever lived will be saved; thus, the relatively small number of true Christians of this age are predestined to be merely the early \\"First Fruits\\" of God's harvest, to help teach the majority of humanity raised by the second resurrection. * The strict observance of the Ten Commandments is a required response of Christians to receiving the unearned gift of salvation from God. The Ten Commandments are an eternal and inexorable law, set in motion by God, which brings about every good effect when obeyed, but exacts pain, suffering, and eventually death (especially an ultimate spiritual death) when violated. * The Holy Days of the Old Testament are still to be observed by Christians, and teach symbolically the seven steps of God's master plan of salvation for humanity. * A system of tithing in which 10% of one's total increase was donated to the church for its operation and for sharing the gospel with the world (\\"first tithe\\"); a second 10% was to be saved for the Christian family's expenses during the Holy Days (\\"second tithe\\"); and during the third and sixth year of each seven-year cycle, a third 10% was to be used for the indigent, widows, and orphans within the church (\\"third tithe\\"). Besides first, second, and third tithes, there was a \\"tithe of a tithe\\", 10% of one's second tithe, for maintenance of festival sites. Free will offerings were expected as well. On top of that there were the building fund, the Summer Educational Program (SEP), and the YOU youth program, all financed by church members. The ministry did not pay tithes; they received tithes as Levites, and lived on a higher income than most members. * Abstinence from eating unclean meats listed in the Old Testament, such as pork and shellfish. * God's children are not actually \\"born again\\" into spirit until after the return of Jesus to the Earth. * The \\"sleep\\" state of the dead, meaning the dead have not yet been judged, rewarded, or condemned, but rather wait to be resurrected. * Punishment of the incorrigible is not an eternity of torment in Hell, but rather a merciful annihilation, through fire, by the edict of God. * Humans are completely mortal (i.e., they do not possess an immortal soul). Salvation is the free, unearned gift of eternal life in God's family as children of God, given upon the prerequisite of faith in God and repentance from sin. This results in a motivation to completely observe God's \\"eternal laws\\" (i.e., Old Covenant laws). * Three resurrections of the dead‚Äîfirst, faithful believers as the First Fruit harvest at Jesus' Second Coming, second, non-believers temporarily resurrected to mortality for an opportunity to learn and accept God's way, and third, resurrection of the incorrigibly wicked for final judgment. This final group will consist of those whose minds had been fully opened to God's truth, either in this age or after the second resurrection, and rejected it; mainly, those truly called but who fell away, and those who incorrigibly rebel in the \\"Wonderful World Tomorrow\\". Controversies Armstrongism is defined as a cult in Walter Martin's book, The Kingdom of the Cults (1965). Martin argues that Armstrong's teachings are largely a conglomerate of teachings from other groups, noting similarities in elements of his teachings to the Seventh-day Adventists (sabbatarianism, annihilationism, and their belief in the soul stays asleep until the body resurrection), Jehovah's Witnesses (rather than the mainstream Christianity belief the soul stays awake and immediately goes to either Heaven or Hell instantly following death), and Mormonism (God Family doctrine).Martin, Walter (1985) Kingdom of the Cults, Bethany House Publishers. pp.303-37 Churches of God There are many splinter churches as well as second-generation splinters from WCG since Armstrong's death. Most of these churches hold fast to Armstrong's teachings and primarily pattern their organizations on how WCG operated. They are often referred to collectively as the \\"Sabbatarian Churches of God\\" or simply as the \\"Churches of God\\" or \\"the COG.\\" Notable churches * Church of God International (United States) (COGI) - the church founded by Garner Ted Armstrong in 1978 following his departure from WCG * House of Yahweh (HOY) - a religious sect in Texas founded in 1980 by former WCG member Yisrayl Hawkins, who preaches a message based on some of Armstrong's core beliefs * Philadelphia Church of God (PCG) - founded in 1989 by former WCG pastor Gerald Flurry following gradual doctrinal changes in WCG * Church of the Great God (CGG) - founded in 1992 by John Ritenbaugh after WCG's doctrinal changes * Global Church of God (GCG) - the church founded by Roderick C.

Humans clap with the palms of their hands, often quickly and repeatedly to express appreciation or approval (see applause), but also in rhythm as a form of body percussion to match the sounds in music, dance, chants, hand games, and clapping games. Some people slap the back of one hand into the palm of the other hand to signify urgency or enthusiasm. This act may be considered uncouth by others. Clapping is used in many forms of music. One example is in gospel music. In flamenco and sevillanas, two Spanish musical genres, clapping is called palmas and often sets the rhythm and is an integral part of the songs. A sampled or synthesized clap is also a staple of electronic and pop music.  Musical works that include clapping  Classical works performed entirely by clapping * Steve Reich, Clapping Music (1972) * Robert Paterson, Voices (1988)Voices , RobPaterson.com. * Pascal Zavaro, Kino-Klap (2008) Classical works which include clapping *Carlos Surinach, Ritmo Jondo (1953) *David Chesky, Flute Concerto et Violin Concerto The clapping patterns known as keplok are important in Javanese gamelan. A type of synthesized clap is popular in many rap and hip hop songs as well. This is derived from and mimics the technique used in older popular music (e.g. disco and funk of the 1970s), in which multiple instances of real handclaps were recorded or a single recording was made of a group of performers clapping in unison. This was usually done for the purpose of reinforcing the snare drum beat on the 2nd and 4th beats of the bar (offbeat). Modern R&B;, hip hop, and rap often omit the snare drum, making the claps a more obvious and central feature of the beat.  Acoustics and medical applications  Clapping is useful in (medical) opening up blocked blood circulation. Clapping can be used in acoustics to check the reverberation time of a room. This is determined by measuring the clap's decay time. A recent contribution can be found in  Pedagogical applications  :See: Counting (music). Clapping is often used to help people recognize the rhythm in sounds. It can be used to help musicians count out rhythms. It is also used to teach phonological awareness to students learning the ways words are constructed. They often clap out syllables to learn to break words into their component sounds.  Sports and other pursuits 'Viking clapping' of Iceland fans Iceland at the UEFA European Championship during UEFA Euro 2016, Iceland's fans became widely known for their 'volcano clap' (or 'Viking clap') with a 'huh' chant, though it originated with fans of Scottish club Motherwell F.C.. Canberra Raiders fans subsequently adopted the 'Viking clap'. Similarly, fans of the Minnesota Vikings have also adopted the 'Viking clap' to show support for the team, chanting 'skol' rather than the original 'huh' chant. The term \\"clap hands\\" or \\"clap hands Charlie\\" is also used in aviation to mean an aircraft collision or wing-to-wing contact, the phrase being derived from the refrain in the popular song \\"Clap Hands! Here Comes Charley!\\" In the mid 2010s, a practice of clapping as a way to emphasize talking points emerged among African American women, especially when clapping out individual syllables in words. This was pointed out in popular media by the comedian Robin Thede on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore. It has since become more widely applied both online, often using the \\"hand clap\\" emoji, and in person.

Early years Cohen was born Abraham Mialczyn into a Jewish family in Radzan√≥w, Poland on 3 August 1887. His father was Josef Leib Miaczyn, a wheelwright, and his mother was Sheindel Lipshitz. In 1889 the family emigrated to England and settled in East London, where Josef worked in a textile factory. They changed their family name to the easier-to-pronounce Cohen, and Abraham went by Morris and Moishe. Cohen loved the theaters, the streets, the markets, the foods and the boxing arenas of the British capital more than he did the Jews' Free School, and in April 1900 he was arrested as \\"a person suspected of attempting to pick pockets\\". A magistrate sent him to the Hayes Industrial School, an institution set up by the likes of Lord Rothschild to care for and train wayward Jewish lads. He was released in 1905 and Cohen's parents shipped the young Morris off to western Canada with the hope that the fresh air and open plains of the New World would reform his ways. Cohen initially worked on a farm near Whitewood, Saskatchewan. He tilled the land, tended the livestock and learned to shoot a gun and play cards. He did that for a year, and then started wandering through the Western provinces, making a living as a carnival talker, gambler, grifter and successful real estate broker. Some of his activities landed him in jail. Cohen also became friendly with some of the Chinese exiles who had come to work on the Canadian Pacific Railways. He loved the camaraderie and the food, and in Saskatoon came to the aid of a Chinese restaurant owner who was being robbed. Cohen's training in the alleyways of London came in handy, and he knocked out the thief and tossed him out into the street. Such an act was unheard of at the time, as few white men ever came to the aid of the Chinese. The Chinese welcomed Cohen into their fold and eventually invited him to join the Tongmenghui, Sun Yat-sen's anti-Manchu organization. Cohen began to advocate for the Chinese. Morris Cohen soon moved to the city of Edmonton in the neighbouring province of Alberta. There he became manager of one of the provincial capital‚Äôs leading real estate agencies and was appointed, on the personal recommendation of the Attorney General Sir Charles Wilson Cross, to serve the province as a Commissioner of Oaths, an appointment offered only to \\"fit and proper persons\\".1 April 1913 appointments made under the provisions of \\"An Act Respecting Commissioners to Administer Oaths\\". It was in pre-World War I Edmonton that Cohen commenced his long and varied military career by recruiting members of the Chinese community and training them in drill and musketry on behalf of Dr Sun Yat-sen‚Äôs representative organization in Canada. Military career Cohen fought with the Canadian Railway Troops in Europe during World War I where part of his job involved supervising Chinese labourers. He also saw some fierce fighting at the Western Front, especially during the Third Battle of Ypres. After the war, he resettled in Canada. But the economy had declined and the days of the real estate boom were long over. Cohen looked for something new to do, and in 1922 he headed to China to help close a railway deal for Sun Yat-sen with Northern Construction and JW Stewart Ltd. After disembarking in Shanghai, Cohen went to see George Sokolsky, the New-York born journalist who worked for Sun's English-language Shanghai Gazette. Sokolsky arranged an interview for him with Eugene Chen, Sun's English language secretary. Cohen was hired, and soon ensconced himself at Sun‚Äôs home at 29 Rue Moli√®re in the city‚Äôs French Concession. He then got right to work. In Shanghai and Canton (Guangzhou), Cohen trained Sun's small armed forces to box and shoot, and told people that he was an aide-de-camp and an acting colonel in Sun Yat-sen's army. Fortunately for Cohen, his lack of proficiency in Chinese ‚Äî he spoke a pidgin form of Cantonese at best ‚Äî was not a problem since Sun, his wife Soong Ching-ling and many of their associates were Western-educated and spoke English. Cohen's colleagues started calling him Ma Kun (È¶¨Âù§), and he soon became one of Sun's main protectors, shadowing the Chinese leader to conferences and war zones. After one battle where he was nicked by a bullet, Cohen started carrying a second gun. The western community were intrigued by Sun's gun-toting protector and began calling him \\"Two-Gun Cohen.\\" The name stuck. Sun died of cancer in 1925, and Cohen went to work for a series of Southern Chinese Kuomintang leaders, from Sun's son, Sun Fo, and Sun's brother-in-law, the banker T. V. Soong, to such warlords as Li Jishen and Chen Jitang. He was also acquainted with Chiang Kai-shek, whom he knew from when Chiang was commandant of the Whampoa Military Academy, which was located outside of Canton. His dealings with Chiang, though, were minimal since Cohen was allied with southern leaders who were generally opposed to Chiang. Cohen ran security for his bosses and acquired weapons and gunboats. Eventually he earned the rank of acting general, though he never led any troops. When the Japanese invaded China in 1937, Cohen eagerly joined the fight. He rounded up weapons for the Chinese and even did work for the British intelligence agency, Special Operations Executive (SOE). Cohen was able to prove that the Japanese were using poison gas to exterminate the Chinese masses. Cohen was in Hong Kong when the Japanese attacked in December 1941. He placed Soong Ching-ling and her sister Ai-ling onto one of the last planes out of the British colony. Cohen stayed behind to fight, and when Hong Kong fell later that month, the Japanese imprisoned him at Stanley Prison Camp. There the Japanese badly beat him and he languished in Stanley until he was part of a rare prisoner exchange in late 1943. Later life Cohen sailed back to Canada, settled in Montreal and married Judith Clark, who ran a successful women's boutique. He made regular visits back to China with the hope of establishing work or business ties. Mostly, though, Cohen saw old friends, sat in hotel lobbies and spun out tales‚Äîmany of them tall‚Äîof his exploits. It was his own myth making, together with the desire of others to fabricate yarns about him, that has resulted in much of the misinformation about Cohen, from the claim that he had a hand in the making of modern China, to such outlandish ones like him having an affair with Soong Ching-ling and a wife in Canada back in the 1920s. After the 1949 Communist takeover, Cohen was one of the few people who was able to move between Taiwan and mainland China. His prolonged absences took a toll on his marriage, and he and Judith divorced in 1956. When the newly formed United Nations began the debate on the UN Resolution on the Partition of Palestine, following the UN Special Committee on Palestine recommendation, Morris Cohen flew to San Francisco and convinced the head of the Chinese delegation to abstain from voting when he learned they planned to oppose partition. Cohen then settled with his widowed sister, Leah Cooper, in Salford, England. There he was surrounded by siblings, nephews and nieces and became a beloved family patriarch. His standing as a loyal aide to Sun Yat-sen helped him maintain good relations with both Kuomintang and Chinese Communist leaders, and he soon was able to arrange consulting jobs with Vickers (planes), Rolls-Royce (engines) and Decca Radar. His last visit to China was during the start of the Cultural Revolution as an honoured guest of Zhou Enlai. Morris Cohen died in 1970 in Salford. He is buried in Blackley Jewish Cemetery in Manchester.Krasno, Rena (2001). \\"Two-Gun Cohen‚Äôs Tomb in Manchester\\".

Name The original German name of the Black Company was Schwarzer Haufen. The term Schwarz (black) pointed out the ideological distance of the company from the large peasant army at that time, which called itself the Heller Haufen (Hell meaning \\"light-colored\\"). The German word Haufen was the name the peasants gave to their armed companies. It was never used again for an army, possibly because the word Haufen means \\"heap\\" in German and was used to refer to loosely organised armed rabbles. Formation The Black Company was formed in 1525 in Rothenburg, out of local, home guard farmers - maybe 600 men - and a company of mercenary knights. The leader of the Black Company, at least nominally, was nobleman Florian Geyer. Geyer managed to shape the Black Company into something like a company of real soldiers, instead of just an armed mob. Some of the knights were probably his vassals. History After the Company took over the area around Rothenburg, it proceeded to Swabia to destroy fortified monasteries and castles and prevent their becoming strongholds of the Swabian League. Those who didn't attack the Black Company were left unharmed during these actions. But in Sweinsburg, Swabia, another company, led by peasant leader Jaecklein Rohrbach, executed about 50 local knights after they had opened fire on two negotiators. Geyer disapproved of this slaughtering and moved his troops back to Franconia to continue the fight. But Rohrbach's action had sealed the fate of captured peasants and of Geyer's men. From that time on, the Truchsess (\\"Steward\\") of Waldburg, commander of the Swabian League, showed little mercy to the Black Company and hunted them down ruthlessly throughout Swabia. Rohrbach himself was burned alive when he was captured in 1525. In the Battle of Ingolstadt, in May 1525, the Black Company found itself alone against the forces of the Swabian League after its allies had been destroyed. The Black Company fought its way back to Ingolstadt and occupied the ruins of the castle, the main buildings of which the members of the Company had themselves burned down some months before. The troops of the League encircled the castle and started their attack. The castle's occupants fought off two assaults but during the third attack, and after the League's heavy artillery breached the massive walls, they were killed. Geyer himself wasn't there during the last battle. He waited for an escort in Rothenburg, but was banned from the city before it arrived. Geyer traveled North and was robbed and killed by two servants of his brother-in-law Wilhelm von Grumbach in the night of June 9‚Äì10 in the forest near Rimpar. Legacy The Black Company has remained very popular to the present day, although Swabian rulers did everything to nullify its fame in the years after the uprising, through publishing a number of \\"facts\\" about the crimes the peasants supposedly had committed. The song \\"Wir sind des Geyers schwarzer Haufen (\\"We Are Geyer's Black Company\\") is still found in many German songbooks today.

Similar to other Pteropods, these pelagic marine heterobranch gastropod mollusks are holoplanktonic. Morphology While they are not particularly strong swimmers, the foot of these organisms are modified it to wing-like structures, called parapodia that they employ for locomotion. Additionally, like other Pteropods of the order Gymnosomata, Notobrachaeidae lack shells entirely as adults.Pierrot-Bults, Annelies & Peijnenburg, K. (2015). Pteropods. Encyclopedia of marine geosciences. 1-10. However, they do possess a shell earlier on in their lives. They are also defined by how they possess a posterior gill, strong jaws, grasping tentacles that frequently possess suckers resembling those of cephalopods, and usually possess buccal cones as well. Behavior Like other members of the clade Gymnosomata, Notobrachaeidae are highly specialized holoplanktonic carnivores.Lemus, E., Sanvicente-A√±orve, L., Hermoso-Salazar, M, Flores-Coto, C. (2014). \\"The holoplanktonic Mollusca from the southern Gulf of Mexico Part 2: pteropods\\" (PDF). Cahiers de Biologie Marine. 55: 241‚Äì258 ‚Äì via ResearchGate. In other words, they spend their entire lives hunting in the water column and cannot swim against the column. Also like other members of this clade, Notobrachaeidae feed are very specific prey, with a species in this clade usually specializing in hunting one specific genus of thecosomes, which are also known as \\"sea butterflies\\" and form a sister clade to Gymnosomata with the primary difference being how adults of that clade possess shells into adulthood while Gymnosomata do not. Distribution Members of this family are found globally throughout the upper reaches of the water column, in the pelagic zone, most commonly the epipelagic zone. Following the trend of Pteropods in general, they tend to have the highest species diversity tropical and subtropical latitudes but are less abundant under these conditions. Conversely, they are more abundant but possess less variety in terms of species closer to the north and south poles. However, even in the tropics, they generally appear in high concentrations, resulting in them frequently playing important roles in major role in planktonic food webs.

His most notable achievement was aiding the construction of the Salt Lake Tabernacle on Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah. Grow engineered the meeting hall's unique elongated dome roof. Biography Grow was the seventh child of Henry Grow and Mary Riter Grow. Born in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania, he spent his childhood on his father's sixty acre (240,000 m¬≤) farm. This farm was one of five bequeathed by Grow's German grandfather, Frederick Grow, to each of his children. In his early adulthood, Grow was apprenticed as a carpenter and joiner for the Norristown and Germantown railroads. He eventually superintended the construction of all bridges under George G. Whitmore, president of the railroads and ex-mayor of Philadelphia. In May 1842, Grow was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints; he traveled to church headquarters in Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1843. Grow worked on the Nauvoo Temple until its completion in May 1846. By that time, church leader Joseph Smith had long been assassinated by a mob, and the church had schismed as Mormons were being driven from Nauvoo. Following the leadership of Brigham Young, Grow traveled across the Great Plains to Utah in 1851 as part of the James Cummings Company. He arrived in Salt Lake Valley on October 1, 1851, his 34th birthday. Grow settled north of present-day Ogden, Utah, but was called to Salt Lake City by Young in 1852 to oversee construction projects for Utah Territory and for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In 1853, Grow designed and built the first suspension bridge in Utah, over the Weber River. He was also superintendent for the construction of the original Sugar House sugar beet mill under the direction of Bishop Fred Kesler. From 1854 to 1861, Grow built or rebuilt at least five sawmills, mostly in Big Cottonwood Canyon. He also worked on a cotton mill and built more bridges, over the Provo and Jordan Rivers. The Jordan River Bridge, finished in 1861, employed the patented Remington bridge lattice similar to other bridges he helped construct in Pennsylvania. From 1876 to 1877, Grow served a mission for the church in Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, where he was able to visit old relatives. Upon his return to Salt Lake City, he was assigned to tear down the so-called \\"old Tabernacle\\" that stood on Temple Square and superintended the construction of the Salt Lake Assembly Hall under Obed Taylor. Grow built several residences, including a house for church president John Taylor, and acted as superintendent of carpentry of the church through the 1880s. Grow's last important project was the construction of the Deseret Paper Mill for the LDS Church-owned Deseret News newspaper. Salt Lake Tabernacle In the early 1860s, Young tapped Grow for what became Grow's largest and most famous construction, the dome of the Salt Lake Tabernacle. Young had become infatuated with the idea of constructing the Tabernacle in an elongated dome shape. When asked how large a roof he could construct using a Remington bridge-style lattice, Grow replied that it could be \\"100 feet wide and as long as is wanted.\\" Grow engineered the tabernacle roof to be across and long. Construction of the Tabernacle began on July 26, 1864, but construction of the roof did not begin until 1865 when all 44 supporting sandstone piers designed by William H. Folsom were in place. Grow rapidly built the roof structure from the center out, but encountered difficulty engineering the semicircular ends of the roof. This difficulty dragged structural work on the roof into fall of 1866 even as other parts of the roof were being shingled. However, Grow finished and shingled the entire roof by the spring of 1867, before the interior of the building was finished. He continued to superintend the construction of the building until it was finished. Personal life A polygamist, Grow had seven wives, of which only four bore children. Chronologically in order of marriage, his wives who had children were Mary Moyer, Ann Elliott, Ann Midgley, and Julia Veach. They bore him seven, eight, one, and seventeen children respectively. Notable descendants of Grow include C. Scott Grow and Marlin K. Jensen, general authorities of the LDS Church. In 2012, Grow and Jensen helped plan a large-scale reunion of more than 3,000 descendants of Henry Grow.Henrie, Jessica. \\"Three thousand people attend Henry Grow reunion\\", Deseret News, 6 August 2012.

A blood chit is a notice carried by military personnel and addressed to any civilians who may come across an armed-services member ‚Äì such as a shot-down pilot ‚Äì in difficulties. As well as identifying the force to which the bearer belongs as friendly, the notice displays a message requesting that the service member be rendered every assistance. Etymology Alternative names are escape and identification flags (). Chit (also 'chitty') is a British English term for a small document, note or pass, representing a debt to be paid; it is an Anglo-Indian word dating from the late 18th century, derived from the Hindi citthi. History The first blood chit may have been made in 1793 when French balloonist Jean-Pierre Blanchard demonstrated his hot air balloon in the United States. Because he could not control the direction of the balloon, no one knew where he would land. Because Blanchard did not speak English, George Washington, according to legend, gave him a letter that said that all U.S. citizens were obliged to assist him to return to Philadelphia. In World War I, British Royal Flying Corps pilots in India and Mesopotamia carried a \\"goolie chit\\" printed in four local languages that promised a reward to anyone who would bring an unharmed British aviator back to British lines. The British officer John Masters recorded in his autobiography that Pathan women in the North-West Frontier Province (1901‚Äì1955) of British India (now modern day Pakistan) during the Anglo-Afghan Wars would behead and castrate non Muslim soldiers who were captured, like British and Sikhs. In the Second Sino- Japanese War prior to World War II, foreign volunteer pilots of Flying Tigers carried notices printed in Chinese that informed the locals that this foreign pilot was fighting for China and they were obliged to help them. A text from one such blood chit translates as follows: > I am an American airman. My plane is destroyed. I cannot speak your > language. I am an enemy of the Japanese. Please give me food and take me to > the nearest Allied military post. You will be rewarded. On the UN chit from the Korean war, it is written in Japanese that cooperators will be rewarded and should help for his own 'benefit'. United States Armed Forces When the U.S. officially entered World War II in December 1941, flight crew survival kits included blood chits printed in 50 different languages that sported an American flag and promised a reward for a safe return of a pilot. The kit might also include gifts like gold coins, maps or sewing needles. Many U.S. flight crews that flew over Asia had their \\"blood chit\\" sewn to the back of their flight jackets. Some units added the blood chit to the crew's flight suits while other units gave the blood chit out only for specific flights. Currently, blood chits are a product of the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency. These recent government-issue items are a small sheet of Tyvek material with an American flag and a statement in several languages indicating that the U.S. will reward anyone assisting the bearer to safety. They constitute a written promise of the US Government. While serving in the Global War on Terrorism, some U.S. service members were issued \\"blood chips\\" that looked similar to bearer bonds and guaranteed $500,000 for \\"aid and safe return\\".

They are also known as uminchu (in Okinawan) or kaito (in the Izu Peninsula). The vast majority of ama are women. History Japanese tradition holds that the practice of ama may be 2,000 years old. Traditionally, and even as recently as the 1960s, ama dived wearing only a loincloth. Even in modern times, ama dive without scuba gear or air tanks, making them a traditional sort of free-diver. Records of the female pearl divers, or ama, date back as early as 927 AD in Japan's Heian period. Early ama were known to dive for seafood and were honored with the task of retrieving abalone for shrines and imperial emperors. Ama traditionally wear white as it was believed to ward off sharks. Early divers wore only a loin cloth but in the 20th century the divers adopted an all-white sheer diving uniform in order to be more presentable while diving.http://gakuran.com/ama-the-pearl-diving-mermaids-of- japan/title=Ama ‚Äì The Pearl Diving Mermaids of Japan (Nov 2013) Pearl diving ama were considered rare in the early years of diving. However, Mikimoto K≈çkichi's discovery and production of the cultured pearl in 1893 produced a great demand for ama. He established the Mikimoto Pearl Island in Toba and used the ama's findings to grow his business internationally. Nowadays, the pearl diving ama are viewed as a tourist attraction at Mikimoto Pearl island. The number of ama continue to dwindle as this ancient technique becomes less and less practiced due to disinterest in the new generation of women and the dwindling demand for the diving women. In the 1940s 6000 ama were reported active along the coasts of Japan while today ama practice at numbers more along the scale of 60 or 70 divers in a generation. Activities Women began diving as ama as early as 12 and 13 years old, taught by elder ama. Despite their early start, divers are known to be active well into their 70s and are rumored to live longer due to their diving training and disciplines. In Japan, women were considered to be superior divers due to the distribution of their fat and their ability to hold their breath. As described above, the garment of the ama have changed throughout time from the original loincloth to white sheer garb and eventually to the modern diving wetsuit. The world of the ama is one marked by duty and superstition. One traditional article of clothing that has stood the test of time is their headscarves. The headscarves are adorned with symbols such as the seiman and the douman which have the function of bringing luck to the diver and warding off evil. The ama are also known to create small shrines near their diving location where they will visit after diving in order to thank the gods for their safe return. The ama were expected to endure harsh conditions while diving such as freezing temperatures and great pressures from the depths of the sea. Through the practice, many ama were noted to lose weight during the months of diving seasons. Ama practiced a breathing technique in which the divers would release air in a long whistle once they resurfaced from a dive. This whistling became a defining characteristic of the ama as this technique is unique to them. In culture * James Bond travels to Japan in the novel You Only Live Twice.

Located in the Spree-Nei√üe district, Guben has a population of 20,049. Along with Frankfurt (Oder) and G√∂rlitz, Guben is a divided city on the border between Germany and Poland, having been separated into Guben and Gubin in 1945 by the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line.  Geography   Environment  Guben is located in the district (Landkreis) of Spree-Nei√üe in the southeast of the state of Brandenburg. It is in the historical region of Lower Lusatia. Guben's position on the banks of the Lusatian Neisse between two plateaus was advantageous in its early economic development. These plateaus developed from ground moraines of the Wisconsin glaciation period. Both the western (Kaltenborner Berge = Kaltenborn Hills) and eastern (Gubener Berge = Guben Hills) ended up as terminal moraines. The surrounding land is covered with pine forests and lakes.  Districts  Guben is divided into the unofficial sections of: *Altstadt, formerly to 1945 Klostervorstadt (developed from the early Benedictine cloister area, which developed into the industrial suburb of pre-division Guben) *Sprucke (originally Vorwerk Altsprucke, added after 1920 with quarter Neusprucke and after 1963 with quarter Obersprucke) *Reichenbach Guben is divided into the official districts (with district mayors) of: *Bresinchen *Deulowitz *Gro√ü Breesen (with Grunewald) *Kaltenborn *Schlagsdorf  Coat of arms  The coat of arms of Guben depicts a red wall with three gates (Klostertor, Crossener Tor, Werdertor) and three towers. The three inescutcheons depict the arms of the historic rulers: the Kings of Prussia, the Kings of Bohemia, and the Electors of Saxony. The coat of arms of the Polish sister city Gubin features a Piast Eagle inescutcheon instead.  History   Medieval Guben  Guben began to develop around 1200 as a trade and marketplace on the roads between Leipzig and Pozna≈Ñ and between G√∂rlitz and Frankfurt (Oder). A settlement on the eastern shore of the Lusatian Neisse was protected by swamps to the south and by the Lubst, a tributary of the Neisse, to the north and the east. Henry III, Margrave of Meissen, granted this settlement Magdeburg rights on June 1, 1235 and declared it an oppidum (town). On the western shore of the river, a cloister of Benedictine nuns began developing as an outlying suburb of the town on the eastern shore of the river. In a charter of 1312 Guben received its coat of arms displaying three towers. Until 1815, Guben belonged uninterruptedly to the Margravate of Lower Lusatia. Between 1367 and 1635 the margravate belonged to the crown of Bohemia. The city was fortified in the 14th century with earthworks, trenches, and wooden planking, and then refortified from 1523‚Äì1544. In 1635 Elector John George I of Saxony received Lower Lusatia and Guben in the Peace of Prague.  Growth of economy and infrastructure  Guben's textile industry began to develop in the 16th century, although it began to flourish in the 19th century, especially with leather gloves in 1849. Beginning in 1822, Guben's production of hats covered 65% of German demand. Later industrialization led to the production of rugs and shoes. Lignite processing began in the eastern half of the city in 1847. The tradition for weaving is still prevalent in modern times as the textile company Trevira maintains a manufacturing plant in the city. Guben station was opened with the railway between Frankfurt (Oder) and Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw) in 1846 and the Cottbus‚ÄìGuben railway was opened in 1871. A direct line to Forst (Lausitz) was finished in 1904, and a tram line ran in the city from February 24, 1904 until June 8, 1938. Guben c. 1920 In 1815 the Margravate of Lower Lusatia was abolished and replaced with the district system. Guben became the capital of a district within the Province of Brandenburg. On April 1, 1884, the city of Guben separated from the district of Guben and became its own urban district. On December 1, 1928 the region of M√ºckenberg was incorporated from the district of Guben into the city of Guben. Most recently the Anatomist Doctor Gunther von Hagens, from Heidelberg University where he developed many of his cadaver plastinating techniques, has purchased a disused woolens manufacturing factory. This has been renovated and converted into a museum- cum-work centre. He expects to employ approximately 200 people, which will have some impact on the local unemployment figures currently running at close to 20% There have been some objections to this development on moral grounds, but the majority of the Guben's population see this development as a good thing for the future prosperity of Guben.  After World War II  Guben, 1955 At the Potsdam Conference at the end of World War II in 1945, the boundary between Germany and Poland was fixed as the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line. Because Guben was on the Lusatian Neisse, the city was separated into German Guben and the eastern part annexed by Poland to become the Polish town Gubin. Because the historical center of Guben became Gubin, the western suburbs which grew from the Benedictine cloister remained in Guben. Although underdeveloped compared to the town across the river, the remaining Guben began to grow extensively after 1945, especially through the construction of a chemical plant and additional residential areas. From 1961‚Äì1990 Guben was officially named \\"Wilhelm-Pieck-Stadt Guben\\" by East Germany after its first and only State President Wilhelm Pieck, who was born in the eastern half of the city (today's Gubin) in 1876. From June 1950 until July 23, 1952 Guben was part of the district of Cottbus. Guben, chemical plant 1980, shift change  Reunification  The German reunification in 1990 brought economic depression and unemployment to the city. When the district of Guben was abolished on December 6, 1993, Guben became part of the district of Spree-Nei√üe. In recent years the city has begun developing closer ties with Gubin across the river.

Hundreds invested their savings in supposed Poyaisian government bonds and land certificates, while about 250 emigrated to MacGregor's invented country in 1822‚Äì23 to find only an untouched jungle; more than half of them died. MacGregor's Poyais scheme has been called one of the most brazen confidence tricks in history. From the Clan Gregor, MacGregor was an officer in the British Army from 1803 to 1810; he served in the Peninsular War. He joined the republican side in the Venezuelan War of Independence in 1812, quickly became a general and, over the next four years, operated against the Spanish on behalf of both Venezuela and its neighbour New Granada. His successes included a difficult month-long fighting retreat through northern Venezuela in 1816. He captured Amelia Island in 1817 under a mandate from revolutionary agents to conquer Florida from the Spanish, and there proclaimed a short-lived \\"Republic of the Floridas\\". He then oversaw two calamitous operations in New Granada during 1819 that each ended with his abandoning British volunteer troops under his command. On his return to Britain in 1821, MacGregor claimed that King George Frederic Augustus of the Mosquito Coast in the Gulf of Honduras had created him Cazique of Poyais, which he described as a developed colony with a community of British settlers. When the British press reported on MacGregor's deception following the return of fewer than 50 survivors in late 1823, some of his victims leaped to his defence, insisting that the general had been let down by those whom he had put in charge of the emigration party. A French court tried MacGregor and three others for fraud in 1826 after he attempted a variation on the scheme there, but convicted only one of his associates. Acquitted, MacGregor attempted lesser Poyais schemes in London over the next decade. In 1838, he moved to Venezuela, where he was welcomed back as a hero. He died in Caracas in 1845, aged 58, and was buried with full military honours in Caracas Cathedral. Early life Family and childhood R R McIanalt=A stereotypical Scottish clansman, wearing a kilt Gregor MacGregor was born on Christmas Eve 1786 at his family's ancestral home of Glengyle, on the north shore of Loch Katrine in Stirlingshire, Scotland, the son of Daniel MacGregor, an East India Company sea captain, and his wife Ann (n√©e Austin). The family was Roman Catholic and part of the Clan Gregor, whose proscription by King James VI and I in 1604 had been repealed only in 1774. During the proscription the MacGregors had been legally ostracised to the extent that they were forbidden to use their own surname‚Äîmany of them, including Gregor's celebrated great-great-uncle Rob Roy, had participated in the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745. MacGregor would assert in adulthood that a direct ancestor of his had survived the Darien scheme of 1698, the ill-fated Scottish attempt to colonise the Isthmus of Panama. Gregor's grandfather, also called Gregor and nicknamed \\"the Beautiful\\", served with distinction in the British Army under the surname Drummond, and subsequently played an important role in the clan's restoration and rehabilitation into society. Little is recorded of MacGregor's childhood. After his father's death in 1794, he and his two sisters were raised primarily by his mother with the help of various relatives. MacGregor's biographer David Sinclair speculates that he would probably have spoken mainly Gaelic during his early childhood, and learned English only after starting school around the age of five-and-a-half. MacGregor would claim in later life to have studied at the University of Edinburgh between 1802 and 1803; records of this do not survive as he did not take a degree, but Sinclair considers it plausible, citing MacGregor's apparent sophistication and his mother's connections in Edinburgh. British Army MacGregor joined the British Army at 16, the youngest age it was possible for him to do so, in April 1803. His family purchased him a commission as an ensign in the 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot, probably for around ¬£450. MacGregor's entrance to the military coincided with the start of the Napoleonic Wars following the breakdown of the Treaty of Amiens. Southern England was fortified to defend against a possible French invasion; the 57th Foot was at Ashford, Kent. In February 1804, after less than a year in training, MacGregor was promoted without purchase to lieutenant‚Äîan advancement that usually took up to three years. Later that year, after MacGregor had spent some months in Guernsey with the regiment's 1st Battalion, the 57th Foot was posted to Gibraltar. alt=A young, rosy- cheeked man in the red uniform of the British Army. MacGregor was introduced to Maria Bowater, the daughter of a Royal Navy admiral, around 1804. Maria commanded a substantial dowry and, apart from her by-now-deceased father, was related to two generals, a member of parliament and the botanist Aylmer Bourke Lambert. Gregor and Maria married at St Margaret's Church, Westminster in June 1805 and set up home in London, at the residence of the bride's aunt. Two months later, having rejoined the 57th Foot in Gibraltar, MacGregor bought the rank of captain for about ¬£900, choosing not to wait the seven years such a promotion might take without purchase. The 57th Foot remained in Gibraltar between 1805 and 1809. During this time MacGregor developed an obsession with dress, rank insignia and medals that made him unpopular in the regiment; he forbade any enlisted man or non-commissioned officer to leave his quarters in anything less than full dress uniform. In 1809 the 57th Foot was sent to Portugal as reinforcements for the Anglo-Portuguese Army under the Duke of Wellington, during his second attempt to drive the French out of Spain during the Peninsular War. MacGregor's regiment disembarked at Lisbon about three months into the campaign, on 15 July. By September it was garrisoning Elvas, near the frontier with Spain. Soon thereafter MacGregor was seconded to the 8th Line Battalion of the Portuguese Army, where he served with the rank of major from October 1809 to April 1810. According to Michael Rafter, author of a highly critical 1820 biography of MacGregor, this secondment came after a disagreement between MacGregor and a superior officer, \\"originally of a trivial nature\\", that intensified to such an extent that the young captain was forced to request discharge. This was promptly granted. MacGregor formally retired from the British service on 24 May 1810, receiving back the ¬£1,350 he had paid for the ranks of ensign and captain, and returned to Britain. The 57th Foot's actions at the Battle of Albuera on 16 May 1811 would earn it considerable prestige and the nickname \\"the Die-Hards\\"; MacGregor would thereafter make much of his association‚Äîdespite having left the regiment one year prior. Edinburgh to Caracas On his return to Britain the 23-year- old MacGregor and his wife moved into a house rented by his mother in Edinburgh. There he assumed the title of \\"Colonel\\", wore the badge of a Portuguese knightly order and toured the city in an extravagant and brightly- coloured coach. After failing to attain high social status in Edinburgh, MacGregor moved back to London in 1811 and began styling himself \\"Sir Gregor MacGregor, Bart.\\", falsely claiming to have succeeded to the MacGregor clan chieftainship; he also alluded to family ties with a selection of dukes, earls and barons. This had little bearing on reality but MacGregor nevertheless created an air of credible respectability for himself in London society. In December 1811, Maria MacGregor died. At a stroke MacGregor lost his main source of income and the support of the influential Bowater family. His choices were, Sinclair suggests, limited: announcing his engagement to another heiress so soon after Maria's death might draw embarrassing public protests from the Bowaters, and returning home to farm the MacGregor lands in Scotland would be in his mind unacceptably dull. His only real experience was military, but the manner of his exit from the British Army would make a return there awkward at best. MacGregor's interest was aroused by the colonial revolts against Spanish rule in Latin America, particularly Venezuela, where seven of the ten provinces had declared themselves an independent republic in July 1811, starting the Venezuelan War of Independence. The Venezuelan revolutionary General Francisco de Miranda had been feted in London society during his recent visit, and may have met MacGregor. Noting the treatment London's highest circles gave to Miranda, MacGregor formed the idea that exotic adventures in the New World might earn him similar celebrity on his homecoming. He sold the small Scottish estate he had inherited from his father and grandfather and sailed for South America in early 1812. On the way he stopped in Jamaica, where according to Rafter he was tempted to settle among the planters and traders, but \\"having no introductory letters to that place, he was not received into society\\". After a comfortable sojourn in Kingston, he sailed for Venezuela and disembarked there in April 1812. South America Venezuela, under Miranda Charles Lees in 1821alt=A dark-haired, exotic- looking young lady in a light-coloured dress MacGregor arrived in the Venezuelan capital Caracas a fortnight after much of the city had been destroyed by an earthquake. With swathes of the country under the control of advancing royalist armies, the revolutionary government was losing support and starting to fracture. MacGregor dropped his pretended Scottish baronetcy, reasoning that it might undermine the republican credentials he hoped to establish, but continued to style himself \\"Sir Gregor\\" on the basis that he was, he claimed, a knight of the Portuguese Order of Christ. He offered his services directly to Miranda in Caracas. As a former British Army officer‚Äîfrom the famous \\"Die-Hards\\", no less‚Äîhe was received with alacrity and given command of a cavalry battalion with the rank of colonel. In his first action, MacGregor and his cavalry routed a royalist force west of Maracay, between Valencia and Caracas. Subsequent engagements were less successful, but the republican leaders were still pleased with the glamour they perceived this dashing Scottish officer to give their cause. MacGregor married Do√±a Josefa Antonia Andrea Aristeguieta y Lovera, daughter of a prominent Caracas family and a cousin of the revolutionary Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, in Maracay on 10 June 1812. By the end of that month Miranda had promoted MacGregor to brigadier-general, but the revolutionary cause was failing; in July, after the royalists took the key port of Puerto Cabello from Bol√≠var, the republic capitulated. In the chaos that ensued Miranda was captured by the Spanish while the remnants of the republican leadership, including MacGregor with Josefa in tow, were evacuated to the Dutch island of Cura√ßao aboard a British brig, the Sapphire. Bol√≠var joined them there later in the year. New Granada; defence of Cartagena With Miranda imprisoned in Spain, Bol√≠var emerged as the new leader of the Venezuelan independence movement. He resolved that they would have to take some time to prepare before returning to the mainland. Growing bored in Cura√ßao, MacGregor decided to offer his services to General Antonio Nari√±o's republican armies in Venezuela's western neighbour, New Granada. He escorted Josefa to lodgings in Jamaica, then travelled to Nari√±o's base at Tunja in the eastern Andes. Miranda's name won the Scotsman a fresh commission in the service of New Granada, with command of 1,200 men in the Socorro district near the border with Venezuela. There was little action in this sector; Nari√±o's forces were mainly engaged around Popay√°n in the south-west, where the Spanish had a large garrison. Rafter reports positively on MacGregor's conduct in Socorro, writing that \\"by the introduction of the European system of tactics, [he] considerably improved the discipline of the troops\\", but some under his command disliked him. An official in C√∫cuta, the district capital, expressed utter contempt for MacGregor in a letter to a friend: \\"I am sick and tired of this bluffer, or Quixote, or the devil knows what. This man can hardly serve us in New Granada without heaping ten thousand embarrassments upon us.\\" Cartagena, where MacGregor took part in the defence against Spanish attackers in 1815alt=Old, somewhat decayed battlements, with a sunset in the background over the sea. While MacGregor was in the New Granadian service, Bol√≠var raised a force of Venezuelan exiles and local troops in the port of Cartagena, and captured Caracas on 4 August 1813. The royalists quickly rallied and crushed Bol√≠var's second republic in mid-1814. Nari√±o's New Granadian nationalists surrendered around the same time. MacGregor withdrew to Cartagena, which was still in revolutionary hands, and at the head of native troops destroyed hamlets, local infrastructure and produce to prevent the Spanish from using them. A Spanish force of about 6,000 landed in late August 1815 and, after repeatedly failing to overcome the 5,000 defenders, deployed to subdue the fortress by blockade. Sinclair records that MacGregor played an \\"honourable, though not conspicuous\\" part in the defence. By November there remained in Cartagena only a few hundred men capable of fighting. The defenders resolved to use the dozen gunboats they had to break through the Spanish fleet to the open sea, abandoning the city to the royalists; MacGregor was chosen as one of the three commanders of this operation. On the night of 5 December 1815 the gunboats sailed out into the bay, blasted their way through the smaller Spanish vessels and, avoiding the frigates, made for Jamaica. All the gunboats escaped. Venezuela, under Bol√≠var The British merchant class in Jamaica that had shunned MacGregor on his first arrival in 1812 now welcomed him as a hero. The Scotsman entertained many dinner parties with embellished accounts of his part in the Cartagena siege, leading some to understand that he had personally headed the city's defence. One Englishman toasted the \\"Hannibal of modern Carthage\\". Around New Year 1816, MacGregor and his wife made their way to Santo Domingo (today the Dominican Republic), where Bol√≠var was raising a new army. Bol√≠var received MacGregor back into the Venezuelan Army with the rank of brigadier-general, and included him in an expeditionary force that left Aux Cayes (now Les Cayes) on 30 April 1816. MacGregor took part in the capture of the port town of Car√∫pano as second-in-command of Manuel Piar's column, but is not mentioned in the record of the battle prepared by Bol√≠var's staff. After the Spanish were driven from many central Venezuelan towns, MacGregor was sent to the coast west of Caracas to recruit native tribesmen in July 1816. On 18 July, eight days after the numerically superior royalists countered and broke Bol√≠var's main force at La Cabrera, MacGregor resolved to retreat hundreds of miles east to Barcelona. Two pursuing royalist armies harried MacGregor constantly as he retreated across country, but failed to break his rearguard. With no carts and only a handful of horses, the Scotsman was forced to leave his wounded where they fell. Late on 27 July MacGregor's way east was obstructed by a royalist force at Chaguaramas, south of Caracas and about a third of the distance to Barcelona. MacGregor led his men in a furious charge that prompted a Spanish retreat back into Chaguaramas, then continued towards Barcelona. The Spanish remained in the town until 30 July, giving MacGregor two days' head start, and caught up with him only on 10 August. The Scotsman deployed his 1,200 men, mostly native archers, behind a marsh and a stream‚Äîthe Spanish cavalry were bogged down in the marsh, while the archers repelled the infantry with volleys of arrows. After three hours MacGregor charged and routed the royalists. MacGregor's party was helped the rest of the way east to Barcelona by elements of the main revolutionary army. They arrived on 20 August 1816, after 34 days' march. In Rafter's view, this marked \\"the zenith of MacGregor's celebrity\\" in South America. He had, according to his biographer Frank Griffith Dawson, \\"led his troops with brilliant success\\"; Sinclair agrees, calling the march a \\"remarkable feat\\" demonstrating \\"genuine military skill\\". With Bol√≠var back in Aux Cayes, overall command of the republican armies in Venezuela had been given to Piar. On 26 September, Piar and MacGregor defeated the Spanish army commanded by Francisco Tom√°s Morales at El Juncal. But MacGregor and Piar had several disagreements over the strategic conduct of the war‚Äîaccording to the American historian David Bushnell, the Scottish general probably \\"r[an] afoul of personal and factional rivalries within the patriot camp\\". In early October 1816 MacGregor left with Josefa for Margarita Island, about off eastern Venezuela, where he hoped to enter the service of General Juan Bautista Arismendi. Soon afterwards he received an acclamatory letter from Bol√≠var: \\"The retreat which you had the honour to conduct is in my opinion superior to the conquest of an empire ... Please accept my congratulations for the prodigious services you have rendered my country\\". MacGregor's march to Barcelona would remain prominent in the South American revolutionary narrative for years. The retreat also earned him the title of \\"Xenophon of the Americas\\" (). Florida republic; Amelia Island affair Arismendi proposed to MacGregor that capturing one of the ports in East or West Florida, which were then Spanish colonies, might provide an excellent springboard for republican operations elsewhere in Latin America. MacGregor liked the idea and, after an abortive attempt to recruit in Haiti, sailed with Josefa to the United States to raise money and volunteers. Soon after he left in early 1817, a further congratulatory letter arrived in Margarita from Bol√≠var, promoting MacGregor to divisional general, awarding him the Orden de los Libertadores (Order of the Liberators), and asking him to return to Venezuela. MacGregor remained ignorant of this for two years. On 31 March 1817 in Philadelphia, MacGregor received a document from Lino de Clemente, Pedro Gual, and Martin Thompson, each of whom claimed to speak for one or more of the Latin American republics. They called themselves the \\"deputies of free America\\" and called upon MacGregor to take possession of \\"both the Floridas, East and West\\" as soon as possible. Florida's proposed fate was not specified; MacGregor presumed that the Floridians would seek US annexation, as they were mostly of non-Spanish origin, and that the US would quickly comply. He thus expected at least covert support from the US government. MacGregor raised several hundred armed men for this enterprise in the Mid-Atlantic states, South Carolina, and particularly Savannah, Georgia. He also raised $160,000 by the sale of \\"scripts\\" to investors, promising them fertile acres in Florida or their money back with interest. He determined to first attack Amelia Island, an anarchic community of pirates and other criminals containing about 40% of East Florida's population (recorded as 3,729 in 1815). He expected little to no resistance from the tiny Spanish garrison there. MacGregor left Charleston in a ship with fewer than 80 men, mostly US citizens. He led the landing party personally on 29 June 1817 with the words: \\"I shall sleep either in hell or Amelia tonight!\\" The Spanish commander at Fort San Carlos, with 51 men and several cannon, vastly overestimated the size of MacGregor's force and surrendered without either side firing a shot. Few of Amelia's residents came out to support MacGregor but, at the same time, there was little resistance; most simply left for mainland Florida or Georgia. MacGregor raised a flag showing a green cross on a white field‚Äîthe \\"Green Cross of Florida\\"‚Äîand issued a proclamation on 30 June urging the island's inhabitants to return and support him. This was largely ignored, as was a second proclamation in which MacGregor congratulated his men on their victory and exhorted them to \\"free the whole of the Floridas from Tyranny and oppression\\". MacGregor announced a \\"Republic of the Floridas\\" under a government headed by himself. He attempted to tax the local pirates' booty at an \\"admiralty court\\", and tried to raise money by seizing and selling dozens of slaves found on the island. Morale among the troops plummeted when he prohibited looting. Most of his recruits were still in the US; American authorities prevented most of them from leaving port, and MacGregor was able to muster only 200 on Amelia. His officers clamoured for an invasion of mainland Florida, but he insisted that they did not have enough men, arms, or supplies. Bushnell suggests that MacGregor's backers in the US may have promised him more support in these regards than they ultimately provided. Eighteen men sent to reconnoitre around St Augustine in late July 1817 were variously killed, wounded, or captured by the Spanish. Discipline disintegrated among MacGregor's troops, who were paid first in \\"Amelia dollars\\" that he had printed, and later not at all. Spanish forces congregated on the mainland opposite Amelia, and MacGregor and most of his officers decided on 3 September 1817 that the situation was hopeless and that they would abandon the venture. MacGregor announced to the men that he was leaving, explaining vaguely that he had been \\"deceived by my friends.\\" He turned over the command to one of his subordinates, a former Pennsylvania congressman named Jared Irwin, and he boarded the Morgiana with his wife on 4 September 1817 with an angry crowd looking on and hurling insults at him. He waited offshore for a few days, then left on the schooner Venus on 8 September. Two weeks later, the MacGregors arrived at Nassau in the Bahamas, where he arranged to have commemorative medallions struck bearing the Green Cross motif and the Latin inscriptions Amalia Veni Vidi Vici (\\"Amelia, I Came, I Saw, I Conquered\\") and Duce Mac Gregorio Libertas Floridarium (\\"Liberty for the Floridas under the leadership of MacGregor\\"). He made no attempt to repay those who had funded the Amelia expedition. Irwin's troops defeated two Spanish assaults and were then joined by 300 men under Louis-Michel Aury, who held Amelia for three months before surrendering to American forces, who held the island \\"in trust for Spain\\" until the Florida Purchase in 1819. Press reports of the Amelia Island affair were wildly inaccurate, partly because of misinformation disseminated by MacGregor himself. His sudden departure, he claimed, was because he had sold the island to Aury for $50,000. Josefa gave birth to their first child in Nassau on 9 November 1817, a boy named Gregorio. The owner of the Venus was an ex-captain of the British Corps of Colonial Marines named George Woodbine. He drew MacGregor's attention to the British Legions being raised by the Latin American revolutionaries in London, and suggested that he could recruit and command such a force himself. MacGregor was excited by the idea of leading British troops again after years in command of colonials, tribesmen, and miscellaneous adventurers. He sailed for home with Josefa and Gregorio and landed in Dublin on 21 September 1818, and from there made his way back to London. Porto Bello The third Venezuelan republic's envoy in the British capital borrowed ¬£1,000 for MacGregor to engage and transport British troops for service in Venezuela, but the Scotsman squandered these funds within a few weeks. A London financier, an old friend of MacGregor's called Thomas Newte, took responsibility for the envoy's debt on the condition that the general instead take troops to New Granada. MacGregor funded his expedition through the sale of commissions at rates cheaper than those offered by the British Army, and assembled enlisted men through a network of recruiters across the British Isles, offering volunteers huge financial incentives. MacGregor sailed for South America on 18 November 1818 aboard a former Royal Navy brigantine, renamed the Hero; 50 officers and over 500 troops, many of them Irish, followed the next month. They were critically under-equipped, having virtually no arms or munitions. The men came close to mutiny at Aux Cayes in February 1819 when MacGregor failed to produce the 80 silver dollars per man on arrival promised by his recruiters. MacGregor persuaded South American merchants in Haiti to support him with funds, weapons and ammunition, but then procrastinated and gave the order to sail for the island of San Andr√©s, off the Spanish-controlled Isthmus of Panama, only on 10 March. Going first to Jamaica to arrange accommodation for Josefa and Gregorio, MacGregor was almost arrested there on charges of gun-running. He joined his troops on San Andr√©s on 4 April. The delay had led to renewed dissension in the ranks that the stand-in commander Colonel William Rafter had difficulty containing. MacGregor restored morale by announcing that they would set out to attack Porto Bello on the New Granadian mainland the following day. alt=Battlements and an old cannon, overlooking a harbour. Colonel Rafter disembarked with 200 men near Porto Bello on 9 April, outflanked a roughly equal force of Spanish defenders during the night, and marched into Porto Bello without a fight on 10 April. MacGregor, watching from one of the ships with Woodbine‚Äîto whom he had given the rank of colonel‚Äîquickly came ashore when he sighted Rafter's signal of victory, and, as usual, issued a flowery proclamation: \\"Soldiers! Our first conquest has been glorious, it has opened the road to future and additional fame.\\" Rafter urged MacGregor to march on Panama City, but MacGregor did not make much in the way of plans to continue the campaign. He devoted most of his attention to the particulars of a new chivalric order of his design, the emblem of which would be a Green Cross. The troops became mutinous again after more promised money failed to materialise‚ÄîMacGregor eventually paid each man $20, but this did little to restore discipline. The lack of patrolling by MacGregor's troops allowed the Spanish to march straight into Porto Bello early on 30 April 1819. MacGregor was still in bed when the Spaniards found his riflemen drilling in the main square and opened fire. Awoken by the noise, MacGregor threw his bed and blankets from the window onto the beach below and jumped out after them, then attempted to paddle out to his ships on a log. He passed out and would probably have drowned had he not been picked up and brought aboard the Hero by one of his naval officers. MacGregor would claim that on regaining consciousness he immediately raised his standard over the Hero, then despatched runners to Rafter ordering him not to surrender. The version of events favoured by Sinclair is that Rafter received orders to this effect only after he had himself contacted MacGregor on the Hero. Rafter, in the fort with 200 men, kept up a steady barrage and waited for his commander to fire on the royalists from the ships‚Äîbut to the colonel's astonishment MacGregor instead ordered his fleet to turn about and made for the high seas. Abandoned, Colonel Rafter and the remnants of MacGregor's army had no choice but to surrender; most of the surviving officers and troops entered miserable existences in captivity. Rafter was ultimately shot with 11 other officers for conspiring to escape. Rio de la Hacha Making his way first to San Andr√©s, then Haiti, MacGregor conferred invented decorations and titles on his officers and planned an expedition to Rio de la Hacha in northern New Granada. He was briefly delayed in Haiti by a falling-out with his naval commander, an officer called Hudson. When the naval officer fell ill, MacGregor had him put ashore, seized the Hero‚Äîwhich Hudson owned‚Äîand renamed her El MacGregor, explaining to the Haitian authorities that \\"drunkenness, insanity and mutiny\\" by his captain had forced him to take the ship. MacGregor steered the hijacked brigantine to Aux Cayes, then sold her after she was found to be unseaworthy. Waiting for him in Aux Cayes were 500 officers and enlisted men, courtesy of recruiters in Ireland and London, but he had no ships to carry them and little in the way of equipment. This was remedied during July and August 1819, first by the arrival of his Irish recruiter Colonel Thomas Eyre with 400 men and two ships‚ÄîMacGregor gave him the rank of general and the Order of the Green Cross‚Äîand then by the appearance of war materiel from London, sent by Thomas Newte on a schooner named Amelia. MacGregor bombastically announced his intention to liberate New Granada, but then hesitated. The lack of action, rations or pay for weeks prompted most of the British volunteers to go home. MacGregor's force, which had comprised 900 men at its peak (including officers), had dwindled to no more than 250 by the time he directed the Amelia and two other vessels to Rio de la Hacha on 29 September 1819. His remaining officers included Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Rafter, who had bought a commission with the hope of rescuing his brother William. After being driven away from Rio de la Hacha harbour by cannon on 4 October, MacGregor ordered a night landing west of the town and said that he would take personal command once the troops were ashore. Lieutenant-Colonel William Norcott led the men onto the beach and waited there two hours for MacGregor to arrive, but the general failed to appear. Attacked by a larger Spanish force, Norcott countered and captured the town. MacGregor still refused to leave the ships, convinced that the flag flying over the fort must be a trick; even when Norcott rowed out to tell him to come into port, MacGregor would not step ashore for over a day. When he did appear, many of his soldiers swore and spat at him. He issued another lofty proclamation, recalled by Rafter as an \\"aberration of human intellect\\", at the foot of which MacGregor identified himself as \\"His Majesty the Inca of New Granada\\". Events went largely as they had done earlier in the year at Porto Bello. MacGregor abstained from command in all but name, and the troops descended into a state of confused drunkenness. \\"General MacGregor displayed so palpable a want of the requisite qualities which should distinguish the commander of such an expedition,\\" Rafter wrote, \\"that universal astonishment prevailed amongst his followers at the reputation he had for some time maintained.\\" As Spanish forces gathered around the town, Norcott and Rafter decided the situation was hopeless and left on a captured Spanish schooner on 10 October 1819, taking with them five officers and 27 soldiers and sailors. MacGregor convened his remaining officers the next day and, giving them promotions and Green Cross decorations, exhorted them to help him lead the defence. Immediately afterwards he went to the port, ostensibly to escort Eyre's wife and two children to safety on a ship. After putting the Eyres on the Lovely Ann, he boarded the Amelia and ordered the ships out to sea just as the Spanish attacked. General Eyre and the troops left behind were all killed. MacGregor reached Aux Cayes to find news of this latest debacle had preceded him, and he was shunned. A friend in Jamaica, Thomas Higson, informed him through letters that Josefa and Gregorio had been evicted, and until Higson's intervention had sought sanctuary in a slave's hut. MacGregor was wanted in Jamaica for piracy and so could not join his family there. He similarly could not go back to Bol√≠var, who was so outraged by MacGregor's recent conduct that he accused the Scotsman of treason and ordered his death by hanging if he ever set foot on the South American mainland again. MacGregor's whereabouts for the half year following October 1819 are unknown. Back in London in June 1820, Michael Rafter published his highly censorious account of MacGregor's adventures, Memoirs of Gregor M'Gregor, dedicating the book to his brother Colonel William Rafter and the troops abandoned at Porto Bello and Rio de la Hacha. In his summary Rafter speculated that following the latter episode MacGregor was \\"politically, though not naturally dead\\"‚Äî\\"to suppose\\", he wrote, \\"that any person could be induced again to join him in his desperate projects, would be to conceive a degree of madness and folly of which human nature, however fallen, is incapable\\". Poyais scheme Cazique of Poyais MacGregor's next known location is at the court of King George Frederic Augustus of the Mosquito Coast, at Cape Gracias a Dios on the Gulf of Honduras in April 1820. The Mosquito people, descendants of shipwrecked African slaves and indigenous people, shared the historic British antipathy towards Spain, and the British authorities in the region had crowned their most powerful chieftains as \\"kings\\" since the 17th century. These were kings in little more than name, with no effective control over the country they ostensibly led; Britain crowned and protected them simply so they could declare the area to be under Mosquito sovereignty and thereby obstruct Spanish claims. There had been a modest British settlement on the coast around the Black River (now the R√≠o Sico), but this had been evacuated following the Anglo-Spanish Convention of 1786. By the 1820s the most visible sign of prior colonisation was a small graveyard overgrown by the jungle. On 29 April 1820, George Frederic Augustus signed a document granting MacGregor and his heirs a substantial swathe of Mosquito territory‚Äî8,000,000 acres (12,500 square miles; 32,375 square kilometres), an area larger than Wales‚Äîin exchange for rum and jewellery. The land was pleasing to the eye but unfit for cultivation and could sustain little in the way of livestock. Its area was roughly a triangle with corners at Cape Gracias a Dios, Cape Camar√≥n and the Black River's headwaters. MacGregor dubbed this area \\"Poyais\\" after the natives of the highlands around the Black River's source, the Paya or \\"Poyer\\" people (today called the Pech), and in mid-1821 appeared back in London calling himself the Cazique of Poyais‚Äî\\"Cazique\\", a Spanish-American word for a native chief, being equivalent in MacGregor's usage to \\"Prince\\". He claimed to have been created such by the Mosquito king, but in fact both the title and Poyais were of his own invention. Despite Rafter's book, London society remained largely unaware of MacGregor's failures over the past few years, but remembered successes such as his march to Barcelona; similarly his association with the \\"Die-Hards\\" of the 57th Foot was recalled, but his dubious early discharge was not. In this climate of a constantly shifting Latin America, where governments rose, fell, and adopted new names from year to year, it did not seem so implausible that there might be a country called Poyais or that a decorated general like MacGregor might be its leader. The Cazique became \\"a great adornment for the dinner tables and ballrooms of sophisticated London\\", Sinclair writes‚Äîrumours abounded that he was partially descended from indigenous royalty. His exotic appeal was enhanced by the arrival of the striking \\"Princess of Poyais\\", Josefa, who had given birth to a girl named Josefa Anna Gregoria at MacGregor's sister's home in Ireland. The MacGregors received countless social invitations, including an official reception at Guildhall from the Lord Mayor of London. MacGregor said that he had come to London to attend King George IV's coronation on the Poyers' behalf, and to seek investment and immigrants for Poyais. He claimed to have inherited a democratic system of government there, with a basic civil service and military. To those interested MacGregor showed what he said was a copy of a printed proclamation he had issued to the Poyers on 13 April 1821. He therein announced the 1820 land grant, his departure for Europe to seek investors and colonists‚Äî\\"religious and moral instructors ... and persons to guide and assist you\\"‚Äîand the appointment of Brigadier-General George Woodbine to be \\"Vice-Cazique\\" during his absence. \\"POYERS!\\", the document concluded, \\"I now bid you farewell for a while ... I trust, that through the kindness of Almighty Providence, I shall be again enabled to return amongst you, and that then it will be my pleasing duty to hail you as affectionate friends, and yours to receive me as your faithful Cazique and Father.\\" There is no evidence that such a statement was ever actually distributed on the Mosquito Coast. So began what has been called one of the most brazen confidence tricks in history‚Äîthe Poyais scheme. MacGregor devised a tricameral parliament and other convoluted constitutional arrangements for Poyais, drew up commercial and banking mechanisms, and designed distinctive uniforms for each regiment of the Poyaisian Army. His imaginary country had an honours system, landed titles, a coat of arms‚Äîdoubly supported by Poyers and unicorns‚Äîand the same Green Cross flag he had used in Florida. By the end of 1821 Major William John Richardson had not only accepted MacGregor's fantasy as true but had become an active ally, providing his attractive estate at Oak Hall, Wanstead to be a British base for the supposed Poyaisian royal family. MacGregor gave Richardson the Order of the Green Cross, commissioned him into the Poyaisian \\"Royal Regiment of Horse Guards\\" and appointed him charg√© d'affaires of the Poyaisian legation at Dowgate Hill in the City of London‚Äîthe top representative of Poyais in Britain. Richardson's letter of credence from \\"Gregor the First, Sovereign Prince of the State of Poyais\\" was presented to George IV. MacGregor had Poyaisian offices set up in London, Edinburgh and Glasgow to sell impressive- looking land certificates‚Äîinitially hand-written, but later printed‚Äîto the general public, and to co-ordinate prospective emigrants. Land of opportunity The consensus among MacGregor's biographers is that Britain in the early 1820s could hardly have suited him and his Poyais scheme better. Amid a general growth in the British economy following the Battle of Waterloo and the end of the Napoleonic Wars, interest rates were dropping and the British government bond, the \\"consol\\", offered rates of only 3% per annum on the London Stock Exchange. Those wanting a higher return invested in more risky foreign debt. After continental European bonds were popular in the immediate post-Waterloo years, the Latin American revolutions brought a raft of new alternatives to the London market, starting with the ¬£2 million loan issued for Gran Colombia (incorporating both New Granada and Venezuela) in March 1822. Bonds from Colombia, Peru, Chile and others, offering interest rates as high as 6% per annum, made Latin American securities extremely popular on the London market‚Äîa trend on which a nation like the Poyais described by MacGregor would be ideally positioned to capitalise. Black River in the Territory of Poyais\\"alt=An etching showing a harbour as viewed from the sea, with small boats in the foreground. MacGregor mounted an aggressive sales campaign. He gave interviews in the national newspapers, engaged publicists to write advertisements and leaflets, and had Poyais-related ballads composed and sung on the streets of London, Edinburgh and Glasgow. His proclamation to the Poyers was distributed in handbill form. In mid-1822 there appeared in Edinburgh and London a 355-page guidebook \\"chiefly intended for the use of settlers\\", Sketch of the Mosquito Shore, Including the Territory of Poyais‚Äîostensibly the work of a \\"Captain Thomas Strangeways\\", aide-de-camp to the Cazique, but actually written either by MacGregor himself or by accomplices. The Sketch mostly comprised long, reprinted tracts from older works on the Mosquito Coast and other parts of the region. The original material ranged from misleading to outright made up. MacGregor's publicists described the Poyaisian climate as \\"remarkably healthy ... agree[ing] admirably with the constitution of Europeans\\"‚Äîit was supposedly a spa destination for sick colonists from the Caribbean. The soil was so fertile that a farmer could have three maize harvests a year, or grow cash crops such as sugar or tobacco without hardship; detailed projections at the Sketchs end forecast profits of millions of dollars. Fish and game were so plentiful that a man could hunt or fish for a single day and bring back enough to feed his family for a week. The natives were not just co-operative but intensely pro- British. The capital was St Joseph, a flourishing seaside town of wide paved boulevards, colonnaded buildings and mansions, inhabited by as many as 20,000. St Joseph had a theatre, an opera house and a domed cathedral; there was also the Bank of Poyais, the Poyaisian houses of parliament and a royal palace. Reference was made to a \\"projected Hebrew colony\\". The Sketch went so far as to claim the rivers of Poyais contained \\"globules of pure gold\\". This was almost all fiction, but MacGregor's calculation that official-looking documents and the printed word would convince many people proved correct. The meticulous detail in the leather-bound Sketch, and the cost of having it printed, did much to dispel lingering doubts. Poyaisian land certificates at two shillings and threepence per acre, roughly equivalent to a working man's daily wage at the time, were perceived by many as an attractive investment opportunity. There was enough demand for the certificates that MacGregor was able to raise the price to two shillings and sixpence per acre in July 1822, then gradually to four shillings per acre, without diminishing sales; according to MacGregor, about 500 had bought Poyaisian land by early 1823. The buyers included many who invested their life savings. MacGregor became, to quote one 21st-century financial analyst, the \\"founding father of securities fraud\\". Alongside the land certificate sales, MacGregor spent several months organising the issue of a Poyaisian government loan on the London Stock Exchange. As a precursor to this he registered his 1820 land grant at the Court of Chancery on 14 October 1822. Sir John Perring, Shaw, Barber & Co., a London bank with a fine reputation, underwrote a ¬£200,000 loan‚Äîsecured on \\"all the revenues of the Government of Poyais\\" including the sale of land‚Äîand offered provisional certificates or \\"scrip\\" for the Poyaisian bonds on 23 October. The bonds were in denominations of ¬£100, ¬£200 and ¬£500, and offered at a marked-down purchase price of 80%. The certificate could be acquired for 15%, with the rest due over two instalments on 17 January and 14 February 1823. The interest rate was 6% per annum. If the Poyaisian issue successfully emulated its Colombian, Peruvian and Chilean counterparts, MacGregor stood to amass a fortune. Eager settlers For settlers, MacGregor deliberately targeted his fellow Scots, assuming that they would be more likely to trust him, as a Scotsman himself. Their emigration served to reassure potential investors in the Poyaisian bonds and land certificates firstly that the country was real, and secondly that it was being developed and would provide monetary returns. In Sinclair's assessment, this aspect of the scheme \\"turn[ed] what would have been an inspired hoax into a cruel and deadly one\\". Tamar Frankel posits in her analysis that, at least to some degree, MacGregor \\"probably believed his own story\\" and genuinely hoped to forge these people into a Poyaisian society. MacGregor told his would-be colonists that he wished to see Poyais populated with Scots as they possessed the necessary hardiness and character to develop the new country. Alluding to the rivalry with England and the Darien episode‚Äîwhich, he stressed, had involved a direct ancestor of his‚ÄîMacGregor suggested that in Poyais they might right this historic wrong and salvage Scottish pride. Skilled tradesmen and artisans were promised free passage to Poyais, supplies, and lucrative government contracts. Hundreds, mostly Scots, signed up to emigrate‚Äîenough to fill seven ships. They included a City of London banker named Mauger (who was to head the Bank of Poyais), doctors, civil servants, young men whose families had bought them commissions in the Poyaisian Army and Navy, and an Edinburgh cobbler who accepted the post of Official Shoemaker to the Princess of Poyais. alt=A piece of paper headed with a coat of arms and the words \\"One Dollar, Bank of Poyais\\", with smaller writing beneath. Leadership of the Cazique's first emigration party was given to an ex-British Army officer, Hector Hall, who was commissioned into the Poyaisian \\"2nd Native Regiment of Foot\\" with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and created \\"Baron Tinto\\" with a supposed 12,800-acre (20-square-mile; 52-square-kilometre) estate. Hall would sail with 70 emigrants on , a vessel MacGregor had encountered in South America. MacGregor saw them off from London on 10 September 1822, entrusting to Mauger 5,000 Bank of Poyais dollar notes produced by the Bank of Scotland's official printer. \\"The new world of their dreams suddenly became a very real world as the men accepted the Cazique's dollar notes,\\" Sinclair writes. \\"The people who had bought land, and who had planned to take their savings with them in coin, were also delighted to exchange their gold for the legal currency of Poyais.\\" After MacGregor spoke briefly to each of the settlers to wish them luck, he and Hall exchanged salutes and the Honduras Packet set sail, flying the Green Cross flag. A second emigrant ship‚Äî, a merchantman docked at Leith, near Edinburgh‚Äîwas hired by MacGregor in October 1822, and left Leith on 22 January 1823 with almost 200 emigrants aboard. MacGregor again saw the settlers off, coming aboard to see that they were well quartered; to their delight, he announced that since this was the maiden emigrant voyage from Scotland to Poyais, all the women and children would sail free of charge. The Cazique was rowed back to shore to rousing cheers from his colonists. The ship's captain Henry Crouch fired a six-gun broadside salute, hoisted the supposed flag of Poyais, then steered the ship out of port. While claiming royal status as Cazique, MacGregor attempted to dissociate himself from the Latin American republican movement and his former comrades there, and from late 1822 made discreet overtures towards the Spanish government regarding co-operation in Central America. The Spanish paid him little notice. The Poyaisian bonds' price remained fairly steady until they were crippled by developments elsewhere in the market during November and December 1822. Amid the general instability in South America, the Colombian government suggested that its London agent might have exceeded his authority when he arranged the ¬£2 million loan. When this representative suddenly died, the frantic buying of South American securities was abruptly replaced by equally restless selling. The Cazique's cash flow was all but wiped out when most of those who had bought the Poyaisian scrip did not make the payments due in January. While the price of the Colombian bonds steadied and eventually rose again, the Poyaisian securities never recovered; by late 1823 they were traded for less than 10% of their face value. Disappointment Honduras Packet reached the Black River in November 1822. Bemused to find a country rather different from the Sketchs descriptions, and no sign of St Joseph, the emigrants set up camp on the shore, assuming that the Poyaisian authorities would soon contact them. They sent numerous search parties inland; one, guided by natives who recognised the name St Joseph, found some long-forgotten foundations and rubble. Hall quickly came to the private conclusion that MacGregor must have duped them, but reasoned that announcing such concerns prematurely would only demoralise the party and cause chaos. A few weeks after their arrival, the captain of the Honduras Packet abruptly and unilaterally sailed away amid a fierce storm; the emigrants found themselves alone apart from the natives and two American hermits. Comforting the settlers with vague assurances that the Poyaisian government would find them if they just stayed where they were, Hall set out for Cape Gracias a Dios, hoping to make contact with the Mosquito king or find another ship. Most of the emigrants found it impossible to believe that the Cazique had deliberately misled them, and posited that blame must lie elsewhere, or that there must have been some terrible misunderstanding. The second set of colonists disembarked from the Kennersley Castle in late March 1823. Their optimism was quickly extinguished. Hall returned in April with disheartening news: he had found no ship that could help and, far from considering them any responsibility of his, King George Frederic Augustus had not even been aware of their presence. The Kennersley Castle having sailed, MacGregor's victims could count on no assistance in the near future. The emigrants had brought ample provisions with them, including medicines, and had two doctors among them, so they were not in a totally hopeless situation, but apart from Hall none of the military officers, government officials or civil servants appointed by MacGregor made any serious attempt to organise the party. Hall returned to Cape Gracias a Dios several times to seek help, but did not explain his constant absences to the settlers‚Äîthis exacerbated the general confusion and anger, particularly when he refused to pay the wages promised to those supposedly on Poyaisian government contracts. With the coming of the rainy season insects infested the camp, diseases such as malaria and yellow fever took hold, and the emigrants sank into utter despair. James Hastie, a Scottish sawyer who had brought his wife and three children with him, later wrote: \\"It seemed to be the will of Providence that every circumstance should combine for our destruction.\\" The would-be royal shoemaker, who had left a family in Edinburgh, shot himself. The schooner Mexican Eagle, from British Honduras carrying the Chief Magistrate of Belize, Marshal Bennet, to the Mosquito king's court, discovered the settlers in early May 1823. Seven men and three children had died, and many more were sick. Bennet informed them that Poyais did not exist and that he had never heard of this Cazique they spoke of. He advised them to return with him to British Honduras, as they would surely die if they stayed where they were. The majority preferred to wait for Hall to come back, hopefully with news of passage back to Britain. About half a week later Hall returned with the Mosquito king, who announced that MacGregor's land grant was revoked forthwith. He had never granted MacGregor the title of Cazique, he said, nor given him the right to sell land or raise loans against it; the emigrants were in fact in George Frederic Augustus's territory illegally and would have to leave unless they pledged allegiance to him. All the settlers left except for about 40 who were too weakened by disease to make the journey. Transported aboard the cramped Mexican Eagle‚Äîthe lack of space necessitated three trips‚Äîthe emigrants were in miserable shape when they reached Belize, and in most cases had to be carried from the ship. The weather in British Honduras was even worse than that at the Black River, and the colony's authorities and doctors could do little to help the new arrivals. Disease spread rapidly among the settlers and most of them died. The colony's superintendent, Major-General Edward Codd, opened an official investigation to \\"lay open the true situation of the imaginary State of Poyais and ... the unfortunate emigrants\\", and sent word to Britain of the Poyais settlers' fate. By the time the warning reached London, MacGregor had five more emigrant ships on the way; the Royal Navy intercepted them. A third vessel‚Äî, carrying 105 more Scottish emigrants‚Äîarrived at the Black River, but on seeing the abandoned colony the master Captain John Wilson sailed on to Belize and disembarked his passengers there. The fourth and last ship to arrive was , which arrived at Belize in November 1823, but which was carrying provisions, arms, and stores and not passengers. The cargo was sold locally at auction. The surviving colonists variously settled in the United States, remained in British Honduras, or sailed for home aboard the Ocean, a British vessel that left Belize on 1 August 1823. Some died during the journey back across the Atlantic. Of the roughly 250 who had sailed on Honduras Packet and Kennersley Castle, at least 180 had perished. Fewer than 50 ever returned to Britain. Poyais scheme in France MacGregor left London shortly before the small party of Poyais survivors arrived home on 12 October 1823‚Äîhe told Richardson that he was taking Josefa to winter in Italy for the sake of her health, but in fact his destination was Paris. The London press reported extensively on the Poyais scandal over the following weeks and months, stressing the colonists' travails and charging that MacGregor had orchestrated a massive fraud. Six of the survivors‚Äîincluding Hastie, who had lost two of his children during the ordeal‚Äîclaimed that they were misquoted in these articles, and on 22 October signed an affidavit insisting that blame lay not with MacGregor but with Hall and other members of the emigrant party. \\"[W]e believe that Sir Gregor MacGregor has been worse used by Colonel Hall and his other agents than was ever a man before,\\" they declared, \\"and that had they have done their duty by Sir Gregor and by us, things would have turned out very differently at Poyais\\". MacGregor asserted that he himself had been defrauded, alleged embezzlement by some of his agents, and claimed that covetous merchants in British Honduras were deliberately undermining the development of Poyais as it threatened their profits. Richardson attempted to console the Poyais survivors, vigorously denied the press claims that the country did not exist, and issued libel writs against some of the British newspapers on MacGregor's behalf. In Paris, MacGregor persuaded the Compagnie de la Nouvelle Neustrie, a firm of traders that aspired to prominence in South America, to seek investors and settlers for Poyais in France. He concurrently intensified his efforts towards King Ferdinand VII of Spain‚Äîin a November 1823 letter the Cazique proposed to make Poyais a Spanish protectorate. Four months later he offered to lead a Spanish campaign to reconquer Guatemala, using Poyais as a base. Spain took no action. MacGregor's \\"moment of greatest hubris\\", Matthew Brown suggests in his biographical portrait, came in December 1824 when, in a letter to the King of Spain, he claimed to be himself \\"descendent of the ancient Kings of Scotland\\". Around this time Josefa gave birth to the third and final MacGregor child, Constantino, at their home in the Champs-√âlys√©es. Gustavus Butler Hippisley, a friend of Major Richardson and fellow veteran of the British Legions in Latin America, accepted the Poyais fantasy as true and entered MacGregor's employ in March 1825. Hippisley wrote back to Britain refuting \\"the bare-faced calumnies of a hireling press\\"; in particular he admonished a journalist who had called MacGregor a \\"penniless adventurer\\". With Hippisley's help, MacGregor negotiated with the Nouvelle Neustrie company, whose managing director was a Frenchman called Lehuby, and agreed to sell the French company up to 500,000 acres (781 square miles; 2,023 square kilometres) in Poyais for its own settlement scheme; \\"a very clever way of distancing himself\\", Sinclair comments, as this time he would be able to say honestly that others were responsible and that he had merely made the land available. Lehuby's company readied a ship at Le Havre and began to gather French emigrants, of whom about 30 obtained passports to travel to Poyais. Discarding the idea of co-operation with Spain, MacGregor published a new Poyaisian constitution in Paris in August 1825, this time describing it as a republic‚Äîhe remained head of state, with the title Cazique‚Äîand on 18 August raised a new ¬£300,000 loan through Thomas Jenkins & Company, an obscure London bank, offering 2.5% interest per annum. No evidence survives to suggest that the relevant bonds were issued. The Sketch was condensed and republished as a 40-page booklet called Some Account of the Poyais Country. French government officials became suspicious when an additional 30 people requested passports to travel to this country they had never heard of, and ordered the Nouvelle Neustrie company's ship to be kept in port. Some of the would-be emigrants became concerned themselves and made complaints to the police, which led to the arrest of Hippisley and MacGregor's secretary Thomas Irving in Paris in the early hours on 4 September 1825. Lehuby's ship never left Le Havre, and his colonists gradually dispersed. 1826 acquittal of fraud MacGregor went into hiding in the French provinces, while Lehuby fled to the southern Netherlands. Hippisley and Irving were informed on 6 September that they were being investigated for conspiracy to defraud and sell titles to land they did not own. Both insisted that they were innocent. They were taken that evening to La Force Prison. MacGregor was arrested after three months and brought to La Force on 7 December 1825. He speculated to his confederates that the charges against them must be the result of some abrupt change of policy by France, or of some Spanish intrigue calculated to undermine Poyaisian independence. The three men remained imprisoned without trial while the French attempted to extradite Lehuby from the Netherlands. Attempting to re-associate himself and Poyais with the republican movement in Latin America, MacGregor issued a French-language declaration from his prison cell on 10 January 1826, claiming that he was \\"contrary to human rights, held prisoner ... for reasons of which he is not aware\\" and \\"suffering as one of the founders of independence in the New World\\". This attempt to convince the French that he might have some kind of diplomatic immunity did not work. The French government and police ignored the announcement. alt=A large, austere-looking stone building. The three Britons were brought to trial on 6 April 1826. Lehuby, still in the Netherlands, was tried in absentia. The Crown prosecution's case was seriously hampered by his absence, particularly because many key documents were with him in the Netherlands. The prosecutor alleged a complex conspiracy between MacGregor, Lehuby and their associates to profit personally from a fraudulent land concession and loan prospectus. MacGregor's lawyer, a Frenchman called Merilhou, asserted that if anything untoward had occurred, the missing managing director should be held culpable; there was no proof of a conspiracy, he said, and MacGregor could have been himself defrauded by Lehuby. The prosecutor conceded that there was insufficient evidence to prove his case, complimented MacGregor for co-operating with the investigation fairly and openly, and withdrew the charges. The three judges confirmed the defendants' release‚Äî\\"a full and perfect acquittal\\", Hippisley would write‚Äîbut days later the French authorities succeeded in having Lehuby extradited, and the three men learned they would have to stand trial again. The fresh trial, scheduled for 20 May, was postponed when the prosecutor announced that he was not ready. The delay gave MacGregor and Merilhou time to prepare an elaborate, largely fictional 5,000-word statement purporting to describe the Scotsman's background, activities in the Americas, and total innocence of any endeavour to defraud. When the trial finally began on 10 July 1826, Merilhou was present not as MacGregor's defence counsel but as a witness for the prosecution, having been called as such because of his links with the Nouvelle Neustrie company. Merilhou entrusted MacGregor's defence to a colleague called Berville, who read the 5,000-word submission in full before the court. \\"Ma√Ætre Merilhou, as the author of the address the court had heard, and Ma√Ætre Berville, as the actor who read the script, had done their work extremely well,\\" Sinclair writes; Lehuby was convicted of making false representations regarding the sale of shares, and sentenced to 13 months' imprisonment, but the Cazique was found not guilty on all charges, while the imputations against Hippisley and Irving were stricken from the record. Return to Britain; lesser Poyais schemes alt=A long, convoluted-looking stock certificate MacGregor quickly moved his family back to London, where the furore following the Poyais survivors' return had died down. In the midst of a serious economic downturn, some investors had subscribed to the ¬£300,000 Poyais loan issued by Thomas Jenkins & Company‚Äîapparently believing the assertion of the Cazique's publicists that the previous loans had defaulted only because of embezzlement by one of his agents. MacGregor was arrested soon after his arrival back in Britain, and held at Tothill Fields Bridewell in Westminster for about a week before being released without charge. He initiated a new, less ornate version of the Poyais scheme, describing himself simply as the \\"Cacique of the Republic of Poyais\\". The new Poyaisian office at 23 Threadneedle Street made none of the claims to diplomatic status the old Poyaisian legation at Dowgate Hill had done. MacGregor persuaded Thomas Jenkins & Company to act as brokers for an ¬£800,000 loan, issued on 20-year bonds at 3% interest, in mid-1827. The bonds, produced at nominal values of ¬£250, ¬£500 and ¬£1,000, did not become popular. An anonymous handbill was circulated in the City of London, describing the previous Poyais loans and warning readers to \\"Take Care of your Pockets‚ÄîAnother Poyais Humbug\\". The loan's poor performance compelled MacGregor to pass most of the unsold certificates to a consortium of speculators for a small sum. Sinclair stresses that the Poyais bonds were perceived as \\"humbug\\" not because MacGregor's hoax had been fully unravelled, but simply because the prior securities had failed to deliver profitable returns. \\"Nobody thought to question the legitimacy of Poyais itself\\", he elaborates. \\"Some investors had begun to understand that they were being fleeced, but almost none realised how comprehensively.\\" Other variants on the Poyais scheme were similarly unsuccessful. In 1828 MacGregor began to sell certificates entitling the holders to \\"land in Poyais Proper\\" at five shillings per acre. Two years later King Robert Charles Frederic, who had succeeded his brother George Frederic Augustus in 1824, issued thousands of certificates covering the same territory and offered them to lumber companies in London, directly competing with MacGregor. When the original investors demanded their long-overdue interest, MacGregor could only pay with more certificates. Other charlatans soon caught on and set up their own rival \\"Poyaisian offices\\" in London, offering land debentures in competition with both MacGregor and the Mosquito king. By 1834 MacGregor was back in Scotland and living in Edinburgh. He paid some unredeemed securities by issuing yet another series of Poyaisian land certificates. Two years later he published a constitution for a smaller Poyaisian republic, centred on the region surrounding the Black River, and headed by himself as President. It was clear, however, that \\"Poyais had had its day,\\" as Sinclair puts it. An attempt by MacGregor to sell some land certificates in 1837 marks the last record of any Poyais scheme. Return to Venezuela and death alt=An exotic New World city, viewed from atop a nearby hill Josefa MacGregor died at Burghmuirhead, near Edinburgh, on 4 May 1838. MacGregor almost immediately left for Venezuela, where he resettled in Caracas and in October 1838 applied for citizenship and restoration to his former rank in the Venezuelan Army, with back pay and a pension. He stressed his travails on Venezuela's behalf two decades earlier and asserted that Bol√≠var, who had died in 1830, had effectively deported him; he described several unsuccessful requests to return and being to] remain outside the Republic ... by causes and obstacles out of my control\\" while losing his wife, two children and \\"the best years of my life and all my fortune\\". The Defence Minister Rafael Urdaneta, who had served alongside MacGregor during the Aux Cayes expedition of 1816, asked the Senate to look upon the Scotsman's application favourably as he had \\"enlisted in our ranks from the very start of the War of Independence, and ran the same risks as all the patriots of that disastrous time, meriting promotions and respect because of his excellent personal conduct\\"‚ÄîMacGregor's contributions had been \\"heroic with immense results\\". President Jos√© Antonio P√°ez, another former revolutionary comrade, approved the application in March 1839. MacGregor was duly confirmed as a Venezuelan citizen and divisional general in the Venezuelan Army, with a pension of one-third of his salary. He settled in the capital and became a respected member of the local community. After his death at home in Caracas on 4 December 1845, he was buried with full military honours in Caracas Cathedral, with President Carlos Soublette, Cabinet ministers and the military chiefs of Venezuela marching behind his coffin. Obituaries in the Caracas press extolled General MacGregor's \\"heroic and triumphant retreat\\" to Barcelona in 1816 and described him as \\"a valiant champion of independence\\". \\"There was not a word about Amelia Island, Porto Bello or Rio de la Hacha, and there was no reference to the Cazique of Poyais,\\" Sinclair concludes. The part of today's Honduras that was supposedly called Poyais remains undeveloped in the 21st century. Back in Scotland, at the MacGregor graveyard near Loch Katrine, the clan memorial stones make no mention of Gregor MacGregor or the country he invented.

After studying accountancy she ran a public-relations firm for seven years, before working for Fianna F√°il and as an election agent for Se√°n Haughey. She became a reporter in 1990, writing for the Sunday Business Post and Sunday Tribune. In 1994 she began writing about crime for the Sunday Independent. In 1996 she was fatally shot while stopped at a traffic light. The shooting caused national outrage in Ireland. Investigation into her death led to a number of arrests and convictions. Early and personal life The daughter of accountant Christopher and his wife Bernadette, Guerin was nicknamed \\"Ronnie.\\" She and her four siblings were born and brought up in Artane, Dublin, and attended Catholic school where she excelled in athletics. Besides basketball and camogie, aged 15 she played in the All-Ireland football finals with a slipped disc. She played for both the Ireland women's national basketball team and Republic of Ireland women's national football team, representing the latter in a match against England at Dalymount Park in May 1981. Guerin studied accountancy at Trinity College, Dublin. She married Graham Turley in 1985,Wild Irish Women: Extraordinary Lives from History, Marian Broderick, University of Wisconsin Press, 2002, page 131 and the couple had a son, Cathal (born 1990). She was a supporter of Manchester United football team; her prized possession was a photo of her and Eric Cantona taken on a visit to Old Trafford. PR career: 1983‚Äì1990 After she graduated, her father employed her at his company; but following his death three years later, she changed professions and started a public relations firm in 1983, which she ran for seven years. In 1983‚Äì84, she served as secretary to the Fianna F√°il group at the New Ireland Forum. She served as Charles Haughey's personal assistant, and became a family friend, taking holidays with his children. In 1987 she served as election agent and party treasurer in Dublin North for Se√°n Haughey. Journalism career: 1990‚Äì1996 In 1990, she changed careers again, switching to journalism as a reporter with the Sunday Business Post and Sunday Tribune, working under editor Damien Kiberd. Craving first-hand information, she pursued a story directly to the source with little regard for her personal safety, to engage those she deemed central to a story. This allowed her to build close relationships with both the legitimate authorities, such as the Garda S√≠och√°na (police), and the criminals, with both sides respecting her diligence by providing highly detailed information. She also reported on Irish Republican Army activities in the Republic of Ireland. From 1994 onwards, she began to write about criminals for the Sunday Independent. Using her accountancy knowledge to trace the proceeds of illegal activity, she used street names or pseudonyms for underworld figures to avoid Irish libel laws.\\"Veronica Guerin\\".

On 26 June 1996, while driving her red Opel Calibra, Guerin stopped at a red traffic light on the Naas Dual Carriageway near Newlands Cross, on the outskirts of Dublin, unaware she was being followed. She was shot six times, fatally, by one of two men sitting on a motorcycle. About an hour after Guerin was murdered, a meeting took place in Moore Street, Dublin, between Bowden, Meehan, and Mitchell. Bowden later denied under oath in court that the purpose of the meeting was the disposal of the weapon but rather that it was an excuse to appear in a public setting to place them away from the incident. Veronica Guerin grave in Dardistown At the time of her murder, Traynor was seeking a High Court order against Guerin to prevent her from publishing a book about his involvement in organised crime. Guerin was killed two days before she was due to speak at a Freedom Forum conference in London. The topic of her segment was \\"Dying to Tell the Story: Journalists at Risk.\\" Her funeral was attended by Ireland's Taoiseach John Bruton, and the head of the armed forces. It was covered live by Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann. On 4 July, labour unions across Ireland called for a moment of silence in her memory, which was duly observed by people around the country. Guerin is buried in Dardistown Cemetery, County Dublin. Aftermath Guerin's murder caused outrage, and Taoiseach John Bruton called it \\"an attack on democracy\\". The Oireachtas, the Irish parliament, realised the potential of using tax enforcement laws as a means of deterring and punishing criminals. Within a week of her murder, it enacted the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996, so that assets purchased with money obtained through crime could be seized by the government. This led to the formation of the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB). After the murder of Guerin, Bowden was arrested as were the other members of Gilligan's gang who were still in Ireland. In an agreement with the Attorney General of Ireland, Bowden agreed to turn state's witness, and become the first person to enter the Republic's Witness Security Programme. Granted immunity from prosecution for the murder of Guerin, he was the only witness to give evidence against all four drug gang members at their trials in the Special Criminal Court: Patrick Holland, Paul \\"Hippo\\" Ward, Brian Meehan and John Gilligan. The investigation into Guerin's death resulted in over 150 other arrests and convictions, as well as seizures of drugs and arms. Drug crime in Ireland dropped 15 percent in the following 12 months. In 1997, while acting as a Garda witness, Bowden named Patrick \\"Dutchy\\" Holland in court as the man he supplied the gun to, and hence suspected of shooting Guerin. Holland was never convicted of the murder, and he denied the accusation until his death in June 2009 while in prison in the UK.\\"Obituary of Patrick 'Dutchy' Holland\\". The Irish Times. 6 June 2009. Retrieved 2 August 2012. In November 1998, after evidence from Bowden and others, Paul \\"Hippo\\" Ward was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison as an accomplice, because he had disposed of the murder weapon and the motorbike. This conviction was later overturned on appeal. Brian Meehan fled to Amsterdam with Traynor (who later escaped to Portugal). After the court dismissed additional evidence from Bowden, Meehan was convicted on the testimony of gang member turned state's witness Russell Warren, who had followed Guerin's movements in the hours before the murder, and then called Meehan on a mobile phone with the details. Meehan was convicted of murdering Guerin, and sentenced to life imprisonment.\\"Extradition of Irishman\\". The New York Times. 10 December 1997. Retrieved 2 August 2012. John Gilligan left Ireland the day before Guerin was murdered, on a flight to Amsterdam. He was arrested 12 months later in the United Kingdom trying to board a flight for Amsterdam, after a routine search of his baggage revealed $500,000 in cash. Claiming it was the proceeds of gambling, he was charged with money laundering. After a three-year legal battle, he was extradited to Ireland on 3 February 2000. Tried and acquitted of Guerin's murder, he was later convicted of importing 20 tonnes of cannabis and sentenced to 28 years in prison, reduced to 20 years on appeal. Pursued by CAB, in January 2008, Gilligan made a court appearance in an attempt to stop the Irish State from selling off his assets. He accused Traynor of having ordered Guerin's murder without his permission. Despite the presiding judge's attempt to silence Gilligan, he continued to blame a botched Garda√≠ investigation and planted evidence as the reason for his current imprisonment. Traynor had fled to Portugal after Guerin's murder, and having been on the run from British authorities since 1992, resided mainly in Spain and the Netherlands from 1996 onwards. After a failed extradition from the Netherlands in 1997, which brought Meehan back to Ireland, in 2010 Traynor was arrested after a joint UK SOCA/Regiokorpsen operation in Amsterdam. Traynor, as of 2013, is living in Kent, England after serving time in an English prison. It is reported that he is still wanted for tax evasion in Ireland. Turley remarried in 2011.\\"Graham and Suzanne celebrate their big day\\", The Irish Independent, 31 July 2011 Her son, Cathal Turley, relocated to Dubai and, as of 2016, manages an Irish pub at the Dubai World Trade Centre. Memorial Monument to Guerin in Dublin Castle gardens A memorial statue to Guerin is located in Dubh Linn Gardens, in the grounds of Dublin Castle. On 2 May 1997, at a ceremony in Arlington, Virginia, her name and those of 38 other international journalists who died in the line of duty in 1996 were added to the Freedom Forum Journalists Memorial. Her husband addressed the audience: \\"Veronica stood for freedom to write. She stood as light, and wrote of life in Ireland today, and told the truth. Veronica was not a judge, nor was she a juror, but she paid the ultimate price with the sacrifice of her life.\\" In 2000, Guerin was named as one of the International Press Institute's 50 World Press Freedom Heroes of the past 50 years. In 2007, the Veronica Guerin Memorial Scholarship was set up at Dublin City University, offering a bursary intended to meet the cost of fees and part of the general expenses of an MA in Journalism student who wishes to specialise in investigative journalism.

It is also referred to as the North Fork of the Snake River. Its drainage basin is , including its main tributary, the Teton River. Its mean annual discharge, as measured at river mile 9.2 (Henrys Fork near Rexburg) by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), is , with a maximum daily recorded flow of , and a minimum of . The river is named for Andrew Henry, who first entered the Snake River plateau in 1810. Employed by the Missouri Fur Company, he built Fort Henry on the upper Snake River, near modern St. Anthony, but abandoned this first American fur post west of the continental divide the following spring. Sources The river's source is at Big Springs and the Henrys Lake outlet (10 miles northwest of Big Springs). To the east is Targhee Pass, with Raynolds Pass to the northwest and Red Rock Pass to the southwest. The headwaters of the Henrys Fork are within of the headwaters of the Missouri River (on the Red Rock River and Madison River), located across the continental divide in Montana. Henry's Fork drains the northeastern corner of the Snake River Plain, along the continental divide. River ecology The Henrys Lake outlet is subject to substantial draw-downs from irrigation diversions during the summer. Late in the season, as the draw- downs decrease with the cooler weather, more water is released into the stream, allowing fish to move up from the lower section of the river. The Nature Conservancy sponsors a learning station near the outlet stream. South of the lake at Big Springs, nearly of constant water flow into the river each day. The river flows south through a high plateau in northern Fremont County, through the Caribou-Targhee National Forest, and passes through Island Park Reservoir. It emerges from the reservoir and flows through a canyon that opens up into a broad, flat meadow in the Island Park Caldera in central Fremont County. The river flows slowly past the town of Island Park, through the Harriman State Park, otherwise known as the \\"Railroad Ranch\\", and then descends swiftly as it approaches the wall of the caldera, flowing over both Upper Mesa and Lower Mesa Falls, and emerges from the mountains onto the Snake River Plain near Ashton. It flows southwest across the plain, past St. Anthony, and splits into multiple channels into a broad inland delta north of Rexburg. It receives the Teton River from the east approximately west of Rexburg. It joins the Snake from the northeast approximately southwest of Rexburg, just below . Island Park Reservoir, a component of the Minidoka Project, is used for irrigation in the Snake River Plain. Its drainage provides one of the most important rainbow trout fisheries in Idaho in terms of habitat, fish populations, and use by anglers. The section of the river between Henry's Lake and Big Springs is a major spawning area for trout and is closed to fishing. Henrys Fork has long been noted for its superb fishing, especially its dry fly fishing. Bing Lempke, a pipefitter from nearby Idaho Falls, was considered the local dean of the fishery, until he died in 1990.

It is the administrative seat of the rural Gmina Gubin, though not part of it. Gubin is on the right bank of the Lusatian Neisse river, at the border with Germany. The rail and road border crossings are connected with the German town of Guben, of which Gubin was the central and eastern part until the division of the city by the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line in 1945. Geography Gubin is situated in the Polish part of the historic Lower Lusatia region, at the confluence of the Neisse and Lubsza rivers. It is located on the national road 32 operating as an orbital road for Gubin. It starts at the border crossing with Guben, runs to Krosno Odrza≈Ñskie and the regional capital Zielona G√≥ra, and further leads to the national road 5 that connects Wroc≈Çaw and Pozna≈Ñ. Gubin also has a railway border crossing on the line from Guben to ZbƒÖszy≈Ñ. The municipal area of Gubin comprises 20.68 km2 of which 61% is used for agricultural purposes and 5% is used for forest uses. The city takes up 1.5% of the area of the Krosno Odrza≈Ñskie County. History Medieval Ostrowska Gate Tower at night The trade settlement existed since the 11th century. In the early 11th century it became part of the early Polish state under Boles≈Çaw I the Brave, and later it fell to the March of Lusatia. Gubin began to develop around 1200 as a trade and marketplace on the roads between Leipzig and Pozna≈Ñ and between G√∂rlitz and Frankfurt (Oder). From the 13th century it was a center of clothmaking and wine trade. In the early 13th century it was part of the Duchy of Silesia within fragmented Piast-ruled Poland, and it was mentioned under the name Gubin in a document of Duke Henry the Bearded in 1211. Lost by Poland in 1224, afterwards it often changed affiliation. Its in the later centuries would be Germanized to Guben. Henry III, Margrave of Meissen, granted this settlement Magdeburg rights on June 1, 1235 and declared it an oppidum (town). In the 14th century the town hall was built. In 1319 the town was unsuccessfully besieged by King John of Bohemia, and afterwards it fell to the Dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg, before it was captured by House of Wittelsbach in 1324.Edward Rymar, Rywalizacja o ziemiƒô lubuskƒÖ i kasztelaniƒô miƒôdzyrzeckƒÖ, \\"≈ölƒÖski Kwartalnik Historyczny Sob√≥tka\\", No. 4/1979, p. 479, 494 (in Polish) It was regained by the Silesian Piasts in 1362, and in 1364 and 1367 Duke Bolko II the Small confirmed old privileges of Gubin. From 1368 the town was part of the Kingdom of Bohemia, itself an Electorate of the Holy Roman Empire, in 1469 it passed under Hungarian suzerainty, and in 1490 it fell back to Bohemia, then ruled by the Jagiellonian dynasty, and from 1526 under the House of Habsburg. The town was visited by King of Poland Sigismund I the Old. In 1635, Elector John George I of Saxony received Lower Lusatia and Guben in the Peace of Prague. From 1697 in the Polish-Saxon personal union, it was visited by King Augustus II the Strong of Poland and Tsar Peter the Great of Russia. In 1751, Augustus III of Poland and Saxony established a mint in present-day Gubin, which produced Polish copper coins. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the Kingdom of Saxony ceded the town to the Kingdom of Prussia. Guben became the capital of a district within the Province of Brandenburg. In 1871, Guben became part of the German Empire. Monument to the veterans of the fights for Poland's freedom and independence During World War II, in 1944‚Äì1945, the Germans operated a subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, in which around 1,000 women, most of whom were Jewish, were imprisoned and used as forced labour. In February 1945 the Germans evacuated the prisoners, who were taken to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The old town of Gubin was seriously damaged in the wake of the Soviet Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive during the last stage of the war, with the historic town hall and church being burnt out. When after the war the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line was chosen as the new East German‚ÄìPolish border at the Potsdam Conference, Guben was split between the two countries. The eastern portion of the devastated town, including the historic centre, became again Polish under the restored original name Gubin, while the western portion as Guben became part of East Germany. The pre-war German population was expelled in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement to Guben on June 20, 1945, and Gubin was repopulated by Polish settlers from former eastern Poland, which was annexed by the Soviet Union. While the town hall dating from the 14th century has since been restored, the Late Gothic parish church is today a stabilised ruin. Recently, a historical society has set up plans for a reconstruction. Gubin belonged to Zielona G√≥ra Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998. A large garrison of the Polish Army was based in Gubin in 1951‚Äì2002, including the 5th Infantry Division, which evolved into the 5th \\"Saxony\\" Tank Division in 1956. The garrison was closed in 2002 following restructuring. Since the Schengen Agreement entered into force on 21 December 2007, border controls between Gubin and Guben have been abolished. Coat of arms The coat of arms of both the city of Gubin and Guben are almost identical, which further emphasizes their shared history as one township. Whereas the original arms of Guben features the Saxon coat of arms, the Bohemian Lion and the Prussian Eagle, Gubin dropped the Saxon and Prussian shields after it became part of Poland, and replaced the Bohemian double-tailed Lion in the centre with the Polish Eagle. Education In Gubin, all of the schools to date are run by the local government.

He represented Tennessee in the United States Senate from 1815 to 1823, when he lost reelection to Andrew Jackson. Williams also served as colonel of the 39th U.S. Infantry Regiment during the Creek Wars, and played a key role in Jackson's victory at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814. Williams later distanced himself from Jackson, and aligned himself with John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. Adams appointed him charg√© d'affaires to the Central American Federation in 1825. Early life Williams was born in what is now Forsyth County, North Carolina (then part of Surry County), the third of twelve children of Joseph and Rebekah Lanier Williams. His father was of Welsh descent, and his mother was descended from French Huguenots. Two of Williams' brothers, Lewis Williams and Robert Williams, served as U.S. congressmen in the 19th century. Another brother, Thomas Lanier Williams, was a prominent Tennessee judge. Williams was also the cousin of Congressman Marmaduke Williams .William's Congressional Biography. Retrieved: September 13, 2011. Williams studied law in Salisbury, North Carolina, in the late 1790s, and served as a captain in the 6th U.S. Infantry, from 1799 to 1800. Shortly afterward, he relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee, where he was admitted to the bar in 1803. Around 1805, he married Melinda White, daughter of Knoxville's founder, James White. In 1807, Williams was appointed Tennessee's attorney general, and served in this capacity until the following year. In 1811, he led a mass meeting of Knox County citizens that condemned Archibald Roane for resigning from the state legislature to run for circuit court judge. In a letter published in a local newspaper, Williams blasted Roane as too selfish and too much of a drunkard to be a faithful judge.Leota Driver Maiden, \\"Colonel John Williams,\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 30 (1958), pp. 7‚Äì46. Military activities (1812‚Äì1815) In late 1812, at the outbreak of the War of 1812, Williams raised a small company of some 200 to 250 volunteers, primarily from Tennessee and Georgia, with the intention of invading Florida and attacking the Seminole tribe.Tom Kanon, Regimental Histories of Tennessee Units During the War of 1812, Tennessee State Library and Archives website, November 20, 2007 Williams and other leaders on the frontier suspected that Spain would eventually join the British side in the war, and would encourage the Seminoles to attack frontier settlements in southern Georgia. Williams and his volunteers invaded Florida in early February 1813, and destroyed several Seminole villages, burning over 300 houses, and stealing a large number of horses and other livestock. After reporting that the Seminole country was \\"completely in waste,\\" Williams returned to East Tennessee, and his volunteers were mustered out shortly afterward. In June 1813, Williams was commissioned in the U.S. Army as a colonel, and ordered to recruit and organize the 39th U.S. Infantry for the purpose of engaging the hostile Red Stick Creeks. Within a few weeks, Williams had managed to recruit and partially equip 600 troops. In early 1814, Williams and the 39th were placed under the command of Andrew Jackson, who was preparing an expedition against the Red Sticks in Alabama. On March 27, Jackson attacked the Red Stick camp on the Tallapoosa River, initiating the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. At the height of this battle, Williams and the 39th, which comprised Jackson's main line, charged and captured the log barricade with which the Creeks had fortified the riverbend, forcing the Creeks to flee. In his report on the battle, Jackson commended the actions of Williams and several other officers of the 39th. Soldiers who fought under Williams at this battle included future Missouri senator Thomas Hart Benton and future Tennessee and Texas governor, Sam Houston. Following the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, Williams went to Washington, D.C., to raise money for the 39th, and gradually acquired a sizable cache of weapons. Throughout 1814, Williams and Jackson bickered over these weapons, with Jackson demanding that Williams give them to a militia company in Tennessee, and Williams arguing that federal arms could not be distributed to militia companies. Jackson questioned Williams' loyalty, and Williams questioned Jackson's authority. United States Senate In 1815, Williams was chosen to fill the Senate seat left vacant by the resignation of Jesse Wharton (who had been appointed to the seat a few months earlier following the resignation of George W. Campbell). In 1817, Williams was reelected to a full six-year term. Williams voted in favor of the Second Bank of the United States in 1816, opposed the Bonus Bill of 1817, and voted for the Missouri Compromise of 1820. He was also chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs, and oversaw a reduction of the armed forces. In 1819, following Jackson's invasion of Florida (then part of Spain), another dispute erupted between Williams and Jackson. Jackson accused Williams of spreading a rumor that Jackson had launched the invasion to protect personal land investments in the Pensacola area, and argued that Williams was assailing his character in private conversations in Washington. In 1821, Williams was one of just four senators to vote against the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty, in which Spain ceded Florida to the United States. In 1823, Williams made it clear that he was going to support William H. Crawford (another enemy of Jackson) for the presidency, leading Jackson's allies in Tennessee to seek Williams' removal from the Senate. When they were unable to find a candidate with enough support to defeat Williams, Jackson agreed to become a candidate for Williams' seat. Though Williams had the support of the influential Knoxville RegisterStanley Folmsbee, Sectionalism and Internal Improvements in Tennessee, 1796‚Äì1845 (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1939), pp. 41‚Äì2, 57n. and rising politician Davy Crockett,John Finger, Tennessee Frontiers: Three Regions in Transition (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2001), p. 270. he lost to Jackson by a margin of 35 votes to 25 at a contentious meeting of the state legislature on October 1, 1823. Later life After losing his U.S. Senate seat, Williams ran for Knox County's state senate seat in 1825, but lost to James Anderson by a vote of 982 to 931. President John Quincy Adams pondered appointing Williams Secretary of War, but was dissuaded by Henry Clay, who thought the appointment should go to someone from New York. Adams eventually appointed Williams charg√© d'affaires to the Central American Federation, and Williams thus spent most of 1826 at this post in Guatemala. In 1827, Williams again ran for Knox County's state senate seat. In spite of staunch opposition from Jackson's allies (including Williams' brother-in-law, Hugh Lawson White, who referred to Williams as a \\"mean politician who can get no man to lye upon him\\"), Williams won the election, 1,585 to 1,216. During his term, he introduced a bill calling for the construction of a turnpike connecting Anderson County and Kentucky, a bill providing relief for female debtors, and legislation seeking greater oversight of the Bank of Tennessee. He retired from the state senate in 1829. Williams spent his later years practicing law and advocating railroad construction. He rejected several invitations to run for Congress, stating he had no desire to go to Washington and serve at the \\"bow of the emperor,\\" in reference to then-President Jackson. Williams died on August 10, 1837, and was interred in the First Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Knoxville. Family and legacy Map of \\"Williamsburg\\" In 1816, Williams made plans to develop a subdivision, \\"Williamsburg,\\" on what was then the outskirts of Knoxville (now part of the Downtown area). This subdivision was bounded by what is now Henley Street (which at the time was the city's western boundary), Main Street, the riverfront, and Second Creek.Samuel G.

She became the youngest presenter on Blue Peter aged 18, and one of her episodes was subsequently voted the \\"Favourite Blue Peter moment\\" ever. With her husband Karl Beattie, she presented the Most Haunted series on the Living channel, via their own production company, followed by Ghosthunting With..., establishing Fielding as ‚Äòfirst lady of the paranormal‚Äô. She has appeared in a wide range of other programmes, from The Wright Stuff to Through the Keyhole and I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!. Early life Fielding was born in Manchester and grew up in Bramhall where she attended Pownall Green Primary School and Bramhall High School. She attended Stockport Convent, Hillcrest Grammar School, Davenport and Dane Bank College in Crewe. Career Early career Fielding's first major role came in 1983 when she was cast in the children's BBC series Seaview. The comedy-drama show centred around a teenage girl called Sandy Shelton (played by Fielding), growing up living at her parents' guest house in Blackpool. The show ran for two series and secured Fielding's popularity with younger audiences. After this, Fielding made a guest appearance in an episode of Juliet Bravo. Blue Peter and beyond In 1987, Fielding became a presenter on the BBC children's show, Blue Peter. To date Fielding holds the record of being the youngest presenter on Blue Peter, starting on 29 June 1987 three months before her 19th birthday.

During her time on the show, Fielding won the SOS Award for the Most Popular Woman on Television, competing with Cilla Black, Victoria Wood and Kylie Minogue. Years after Fielding left the show, her trip on a rollercoaster with fellow presenter Mark Curry was voted the Favourite Blue Peter moment of all time by viewers. After five years of Blue Peter, Fielding co-hosted What's Up Doc?, a Saturday morning children's show on ITV. The series ran for three years and established Fielding with slightly older audiences. From 1995 Fielding made a successful transition from children's to television for an older audience. After leaving What's Up Doc?

Presenting the paranormal In 2002, Yvette Fielding and her husband Karl Beattie established their own television production company, Antix Productions. Their first production was Most Haunted for the British TV channel Living. In the show, viewers can see Fielding and paranormal experts investigating various supposedly haunted locations around Britain, in the hopes that paranormal activity may be documented by the crew. Most Haunted proved popular with audiences and remains to this day one of Living's highest- rated original shows. Leading on from this, in 2006 Fielding presented and produced Ghosthunting With..., a paranormal show for ITV2 which shows Fielding leading various celebrities around haunted locations. These two shows established Yvette Fielding as British televisions 'first lady' of the paranormal, and somewhat of a cult figure. Fielding has made many appearances and interviews in the British media in connection with her paranormal investigations and programmes, including guest appearances on The Sunday Night Project (Channel 4), The Chris Moyles Show (BBC Radio 1) and Friday Night with Jonathan Ross (BBC One). Furthering her paranormal franchise, in 2008 Fielding made her first move into radio broadcasting, hosting Yvette Fielding's Fright Nights on Kerrang! Radio. Fielding left the radio station a few months later however, due to other work commitments. In 2008 Fielding and Beattie formed a new company called Monster Pictures to operate the Paranormal Channel. Fielding acted as anchor to the channel and presented original programming on the station. The channel was subsequently renamed the Unexplained Channel in 2009.

In these interviews Fielding stated that she will return to Most Haunted in 2013. In 2014, Fielding once again returned to hosting Most Haunted, when a new series was produced for the Freeview channel, Really. Recent career In March 2013 Fielding appeared in the Peter Kay Sit down for Comic Relief comedy sketch as part of Red Nose Day 2013.

Approximately in area, at in length and in width, its surface elevation is above sea level. It is on the southwest side of the Henrys Lake Mountains of northern Fremont County, approximately two miles south of the continental divide along the Montana state line, just west of Targhee Pass and north of Sawtell Peak. The lake provides the headwaters of the Henrys Fork, a tributary of the Snake River. The lake lies less than across the continental divide from the headwaters of the Missouri River in southwestern Montana. It is due west of the western boundary of Yellowstone National Park, located in an enclave of Caribou-Targhee National Forest. A dam built at the outlet of Henrys Lake in 1923 dramatically increased the surface area of the lake. Springs are found around the shoreline at Staley Springs, Pintail Point, Kelly Springs, the Cliffs, and along the northshore of the lake. Inlets are found at Timber Creek, Targhee Creek, Howard Creek, Duck Creek, Hope Creek, and Kenny Creek. History The area surrounding Henrys Lake has been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries. It was later seen by and named after Andrew Henry. During the Nez Perce War and following the Battle of Camas Creek near what is now Kilgore, the Nez Perce tribe proceeded eastward toward Yellowstone. After receiving word that the Nez Perce had entered the wilderness area, General Oliver O. Howard rested for several days on the side of the lake. To this point, Howards troops had marched every day for 26 days at an unusually quick pace. Following the Russian invasion of Finland in 1939, the U.S. Army began construction of a training outpost to be called the West Yellowstone Winter Training Camp near Henrys Lake Station. Plans were created that included a 100,000 acre training area that could hold 30,000 personnel. Some buildings were constructed in 1941, but were ordered destroyed in 1942. At the time, the military offered no reasoning for the reversal of the plan. It was later discovered by an Ashton resident that the military did not want to interfere with trumpeter swans which used the lake as a breeding ground. The winter training program was relocated to Fort Drum in New York. Wildlife Henrys Lake is home to a variety of migrating birds. The western and eastern edges of the lake provide wetland/marsh habitats that serve as breeding areas for many birds in spring. Notable at Henrys Lake are white pelicans, widgeon, lesser scaup, cormorants, red-necked and western grebes, coots, mallards, bufflehead, ring-necked ducks, Canada geese, blue-winged teal, eared grebe, killdeer, common merganser, common tern, cinnamon teal, trumpeter swans, great blue heron, California seagulls, bald eagles, Swainson's hawks, red-tailed hawks, red-winged blackbirds, cowbirds and more. Recreation Henrys Lake is a popular destination for sport fishing. The most common species in the lake is Yellowstone cutthroat. They make up 55 percent of the trout population. The average size in 2015 was 15 inches, with biologists finding some fish over 20 inches. The second most prevalent species is rainbow-cutthroat hybrids, which make up 24 percent of the population. The average size is 19 inches, although Idaho Fish and Game found hybrids longer than 25 inches. Brook trout make up 21 percent of the population. The average length is 16 inches, with biologists finding several brook trout that exceeded 20 inches in length. There is a fish hatchery on the north side of the lake that helps to replenish the lake. ; Recreational access On the south shore on the lake, Henrys Lake State Park is a 585-acre state park off of US 20 near Goose Bay and the Henrys Lake Outlet with hiking trails, camping facilities and boat ramp. Frome Park on the west shore of Henrys Lake is owned and operated by Fremont County. The park's limited facilities include a boat ramp and campsites, both of which are free. The South Shore Boat Access offers a boat ramp, primitive camping, fishing, and platform for wildlife viewing. The Continental Divide Trail skirts around Henry's Lake. Many north bound thru hikers opt out of this section when leaving Yellowstone National Park and entering the Centennial Mountain Range in Idaho.

George Washington Glick was raised on his father's farm near Greencastle, Ohio. He enlisted for service in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, but saw no action. At age 21 he entered the law offices of Buckland and Hayes (later President Rutherford B. Hayes); he was admitted to the bar two years later and established a moderate law practice, earning a reputation as a hard- working lawyer. Glick moved to Atchison, Kansas, in 1859 and formed a partnership with Alfred P. Otis. He served as a Union soldier in the 2nd Kansas Infantry during the Civil War. Elected to the Kansas State Legislature in 1862, he served for 14 of the next 18 years and was Speaker pro tempore in 1876. He served in both houses of the state legislature. Glick was well respected and considered \\"just and expert\\" by his colleagues. He was elected Governor in 1882 and served until 1885. He was also, despite being the 9th governor overall, only the first Democrat to serve as governor of Kansas. Legislation enacted during his tenure included the creation of a railroad commission, a \\"good roads\\" law, reassessment of tax laws, and the establishment of a livestock sanitary commission. He was later appointed pension agent in Topeka by President Grover Cleveland. After 15 years of civic service, George Glick was forced to abandon his political career because of a throat infection that nearly destroyed his ability to speak. He continued, however, as an attorney for various railroads. He also managed his farm and served as a charter member and first vice president of the Kansas Historical Society. Glick died in 1911 in Atchison, Kansas. Statue replacement In 1914, the state of Kansas donated a marble statue of Glick to the U.S. Capitol's National Statuary Hall Collection as one of its two allowed entries. The statue was sculpted by Charles Niehaus, who sculpted seven other statues for the collection, including Kansas's other entry, Senator John J. Ingalls in 1905. In 2003, Kansas became the first state to replace a statue when it replaced Glick with a bronze of former president Dwight D. Eisenhower. Glick's statue was moved to the Kansas History Center in Topeka.

Bob \\"Snake\\" Plissken is the protagonist of the films Escape from New York and Escape from L.A. He is portrayed by Kurt Russell, and created by director John Carpenter and screenwriter Nick Castle. An anti-hero, he is a former Special Forces operator/war hero in World War III turned criminal. The movies follow his apprehension by the United States Police Force and subsequent conscription to extract top-secret material from New York City and Los Angeles‚Äîwhich have, in this dystopian setting, been entirely converted into maximum-security prisons. Fictional biography Background Snake Plissken is a former U.S. Army Lieutenant, serving under Special Forces Unit \\"Black Light\\" stated by Hauk in Escape from New York, with two Purple Hearts, and the youngest man to be decorated by the U.S. President for bravery during campaigns in Leningrad and Siberia in World War III against the Former Soviet Alliances and Eurasian United War Union. Some time later, he turned to a life of crime due to the perceived betrayal of the United States government during the \\"Leningrad Ruse\\" (when he lost the use of his left eye) and when his parents were burned alive in their home by the United States Police Force‚Äîevents described in the Escape from New York novelization by Mike McQuay. He traveled with his war buddy and only friend, Bill Taylor. Snake took up with partners Harold Hellman (later known as \\"Brain\\") and Fresno Bob. In Kansas City around 1993, Hellman apparently let Plissken and Fresno Bob get cornered by police, at which time Fresno Bob was brutally tortured and killed by sadistic law enforcers within the United States Police Force. As a result of the Kansas City incident, it was widely believed in the criminal community that Plissken was dead. This is a running gag in Escape from New York: \\"I heard you were dead\\" (homage to the John Wayne film Big Jake). In Escape from L.A., the recurring joke is changed to \\"I thought you'd be taller.\\" Plissken has a tattoo of a cobra on his abdomen. He is skilled in martial arts due to his military training. Personality Snake is shown as being very cynical, most likely due to the hypocrisy of the U.S. government, and appears to be willing to do anything to survive. He is often stated by others to be somewhat of a misanthropist. He is terse, stern in his speech, of few words, and holds nothing sacred or even important. He does however hold a loose code of honor. He frequently shows coolness and level-headed thinking under extremely stressful situations. Although he will kill without remorse or hesitation, he does not kill for fun or when it is unnecessary. He is also known for his quick wit and gallows humor. Appearances Escape from New York Snake was arrested in 1997 after breaking into the U.S. Federal Reserve in Denver, Colorado. He was sentenced to life in New York maximum security prison ‚Äîthat is, the entire island of Manhattan, surrounded by an impenetrable wall, and then abandoned to fall into anarchy. At this time, Air Force One was hijacked and crashed into Manhattan, and the President, played by Donald Pleasence, was captured by the \\"Duke of New York\\" (Isaac Hayes), the de facto leader of the prisoners. Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef), the New York Police Commissioner, offered Snake a full pardon for every criminal action he had committed in the United States if he would go in and rescue the President. The President carried technical information that would allow the United States to be the dominant world power, but in 24 hours it would become useless. Hauk enforced the time limit by implanting microscopic explosive capsules in Plissken's carotid arteries, which would detonate at the deadline. Plissken rescued the President with the help of Harold Hellman (Harry Dean Stanton) (now known as Brain, and working for the Duke of New York), Brain's \\"squeeze\\" Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau), and a taxicab driver nicknamed Cabby (Ernest Borgnine). Only Plissken and the President survived their escape. As the President began his broadcast speech, Plissken, who is disgusted by the President's lack of regret for the people who died to get him out, walked away, deliberately shredding the time-critical information tape. The Adventures of Snake Plissken In January 1997, Marvel Comics released the one-shot The Adventures of Snake Plissken. The story takes place sometime between Escape from New York and before his famous Cleveland escape mentioned in Escape from L.A. Snake has robbed Atlanta's Centers for Disease Control of some engineered metaviruses and is looking for buyers in Chicago. Finding himself in a deal that's really a set-up, he makes his getaway and exacts revenge on the buyer for ratting him out to the United States Police Force. In the meantime, a government lab has built a robot called A.T.A.C.S. (Autonomous Tracking And Combat System) that can catch criminals by imprinting their personalities upon its program in order to predict and anticipate a specific criminal's every move. The robot's first test subject is America's public enemy number one, Snake Plissken. After a brief battle, the tide turns when A.T.A.C.S. copies Snake to the point of fully becoming his personality. Now recognizing the government as the enemy, A.T.A.C.S. sides with Snake. Unamused, Snake destroys it. As A.T.A.C.S. shuts down, it can only ask him, \\"Why?\\" Snake just walks off answering, \\"I don't need the competition\\". John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles Cover of John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles. Snake Plissken appeared in John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles, a four-part comic book miniseries released in 2003 that was published by CrossGen comics and Hurricane Entertainment. The story takes place the morning after the events in Escape from New York. Snake has been given a military Humvee after his presidential pardon and makes his way to Atlantic City. Despite the fact the director's cut of the New York movie shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was preplanned before his capture. The job is stealing the car JFK was assassinated in from a casino and then delivering it to a buyer on a yacht in the gulf. The job involves Snake's partnership with a man named Marrs who ends up double crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is luckily saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron. When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat in order to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. But when he ends up saving Ron from a Russian mob wanting money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face to face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed shoot-out. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying Jackie Kennedy, leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally get the car to the buyer's yacht with Ron's boat and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the fire fight the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job. The series is written by William O'Neill, penciled by Tone Rodriguez and edited by Jan Utstein-O'Neill. Escape from L.A. Sixteen years since his escape from New York, Snake is once again enlisted for a similar situation, as the story begins with a similar plotline as was used in Escape from New York. This time, Snake is forced to retrieve a disk for a remote control which controlled a series of EMP style satellites. These devices are positioned around the entire world. The disk was somewhere in Los Angeles. The city had separated from the mainland due to an earthquake in August 2000 and had become an island separate from the United States which had become a totalitarian theocratic police state. Snake had to retrieve a black box which the President's (Cliff Robertson) daughter, Utopia (A.J. Langer), went into LA with. The President says he doesn't care if she is returned or killed, she is a traitor to his country. Snake initially refuses but once injected with the plutoxin 7 virus - which will lead to his death in ten hours - he agrees. Snake retrieves the box and seemingly returns it to the President; however, when the President attempts to activate it, he learns it is not the real box. Snake reveals that he switched the box with a fake, and promptly uses the code \\"666\\" to \\"wipe out all technology\\" in the world. Cancelled projects Television series In July 2000, Tribune Entertainment announced plans to adapt Escape from New York into a television series. However, it was canceled in September 2001, due to terrorist attacks in New York. Chronicles project Along with the comic book, other Snake Plissken Chronicles projects were announced.

Two schools of presuppositionalism exist, based on the different teachings of Cornelius Van Til and Gordon Haddon Clark. Presuppositionalism contrasts with classical apologetics and evidential apologetics. Presuppositionalists compare their presupposition against other ultimate standards such as reason, empirical experience, and subjective feeling, claiming presupposition in this context is: Critics of presuppositional apologetics claim that it is logically invalid because it begs the question of the truth of Christianity and the non- truth of other worldviews. Comparison with other schools of apologetics Presuppositionalists contrast their approach with the other schools of Christian apologetics by describing the others as assuming that the world is unintelligible apart from belief in the existence of God and then arguing on purportedly neutral grounds to support trusting the Christian Scriptures and the existence of God. Specifically, presuppositionalists describe Thomistic (also \\"Traditional\\" or \\"Classical\\") apologetics as concentrating on the first aspect of apologetics with its logical proofs for the existence of God, simply assuming common ground with the non-Christian and utilizing a piece-by-piece methodology. In this scheme, the common foundation of neutral brute facts leads to a generic concept of deity, then to the various characteristics of the Christian God as revealed in Scripture, and so forth. Piece-by-piece, Christian theology is built up from a neutral common ground. Presuppositionalists assert that many of the classical arguments are logically fallacious, or do not prove enough, when used as arguments to prove the existence or character of God. They criticize both the assumption of neutrality and the \\"block house\\" or \\"piecemeal\\" method for failing to start at the level of the controlling beliefs of worldviews and implicitly allowing non-Christian assumptions from the start, thereby trying to build a Christian \\"house\\" on a non-Christian \\"foundation\\". Evidentialists demur from this assessment, claiming that presuppositionalism amounts to fideism because it rejects the idea of shared points of reference between the Christian and non- Christian from which they may reason in common. The conclusion of evidential apologetics is that the Bible's historical accounts and other truth-claims are more probably true than false, thus the whole of scriptural revelation may be rationally accepted, and where we can't approach absolute certainty we must accept the explanations most likely to be true. The goal of presuppositional apologetics, on the other hand, is to argue that the assumptions and actions of non-Christians require them to believe certain things about God, man, and the world which they claim not to believe. This type of argument is technically called a reductio ad absurdum in that it attempts to reduce the opposition to holding an absurd, i.e., self-contradictory position; in this case, both believing in facts of Christian revelation (in practice) and denying them (in word). So, in essence, evidential apologetics attempts to build upon a shared acceptance of self-evident or worldview-neutral facts, while presuppositional apologetics attempts to claim all facts for the Calvinistic Christian (sic Arminian) worldview as the only framework in which they are intelligible. History The modern origins of presuppositional apologetics are in the work of Dutch theologian Cornelius Van Til, a member of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, who began to adopt a presuppositional approach to defending the truth of his faith as early as the late 1920s. Van Til personally disliked the term \\"presuppositional\\", as he felt it misrepresented his approach to apologetics, which he felt was focused primarily on the preeminence of the Bible as the ultimate criterion for truth, rather than denying or ignoring evidence. He did, however, accept the label reluctantly, given that it was a useful way of distinguishing between those who deny a neutral basis for apologetics and those who do not. His student, Greg Bahnsen, aided in some of the later developments of Van Tillian Presuppositionalism, and the Bahnsen Theological Seminary continues to promote presuppositional apologetics in its curriculum. John Frame, another student of Van Til, also continues to advocate a presuppositional approach, although he is generally more critical of Van Til's thought than Bahnsen was. Bahnsen's prot√©g√©, Michael R. Butler, has also been active in advancing the field. Among his contributions is a technical, metalogical study of transcendental arguments in general and the Transcendental argument for the existence of God in particular, which he wrote for Bahnsen's festschrift. By 1952, presuppositional apologetics had acquired a new advocate in the Presbyterian theologian Gordon Clark. He embraced the label \\"presuppositional\\" since his approach to apologetics, emphasizing the priority of epistemology and an axiom of revelation, was more closely concerned with the logical order of assumptions than was Van Til. The differences between the two views on presuppositionalism, though few in number, caused a significant rift between the two men, and even after both Clark and Van Til had died, John Robbins (a theologian and former student of Clark's) and Bahnsen were often involved in heated exchanges.... In a 2000 book outlining the major schools of apologetics, the presuppositional approach was given equal time alongside other schools of thought (the \\"classical\\" and \\"evidential\\" noted above, for example). In general, Van Til's approach is far more popular and widespread than Clark's. Van Til is considered by Dr. John Frame, Professor of Systematic Theology and Philosophy at Reformed Theological Seminary, to be one of the most outstanding apologists of his time due to his being \\"probably the best versed on the history of philosophy and the philosophical issues that bore upon Christianity\\". Varieties  Van Tillian presuppositionalism  Cornelius Van Til Apologists who follow Van Til earned the label \\"presuppositional\\" because of their central tenet that the Christian must at all times presuppose the supernatural revelation of the Bible as the ultimate arbiter of truth and error in order to know anything. Christians, they say, can assume nothing less because all human thought presupposes the existence of the God of the Bible. They claim that by accepting the assumptions of non- Christians, which fundamentally deny the Trinitarian God of the Bible, one could not even formulate an intelligible argument. Though Van Tillians do, at one point, \\"put themselves in the shoes\\" of the opponent, \\"for the sake of argument\\", to demonstrate where that position would lead, they claim that they can only do so because this is actually God's world, and man is actually God's creature, made in God's own image, and as such can never completely shut God out (in living or thinking)‚Äîhence there is always a common basis for dialogue, even though it is, in the presuppositionalist's view, a basis which the opponent is not usually willing to acknowledge and which is decidedly biased rather than neutral. According to Frame, \\"[Van Til's] major complaints against competing apologetic methods are theological complaints, that is, that they compromise the incomprehensibility of God, total depravity, the clarity of natural revelation, God's comprehensive control over creation, and so on.\\" Within their presuppositionalist framework, Van Tillians do often utilize foundational concepts for Thomistic and Evidentialist arguments (belief in the uniformity of natural causes, for example), but they are unwilling to grant that such beliefs are justifiable on \\"natural\\" (neutral) grounds. Rather, Van Tillians employ these beliefs, which they justify on Biblical grounds, in the service of transcendental arguments, which are a sort of meta-argument about foundational principles, necessary preconditions, in which the non-Christian's worldview is shown to be incoherent in and of itself and intelligible only because it borrows capital from the Christian worldview. For example, where evidentialists would take the uniformity of natural causes in a closed system as a neutral common starting point and construct a cosmological argument for an unmoved mover, Van Tillian presuppositionalists would ask for a justification for the belief in the uniformity of natural causes in a closed system, given the worldview of the opponent, attempting to show that such a belief presupposes the Christian worldview and is ultimately incompatible with the opposing worldview. Van Til summarized the main drive of his apologetic by saying: \\"the only proof for the existence of God is that without God you couldn't prove anything.\\" Van Tillians also stress the importance of reckoning with \\"the noetic effects of sin\\" (that is, the effects of sin on the mind), which, they maintain, corrupt man's ability to understand God, the world, and himself aright. In their view, as a fallen creature, man does know the truth in each of these areas, but he seeks to find a different interpretation‚Äîone in which, as C. S. Lewis said, he is \\"on the bench\\" and God is \\"in the dock.\\" The primary job of the apologist is, therefore, simply to confront the unbeliever with the fact that, while he is verbally denying the truth, he is nonetheless practically behaving in accord with it. Van Til illustrated this alleged inconsistency as a child, elevated on the father's knee, reaching up to slap his face, and Bahnsen used the analogy of a man breathing out air to make the argument that air doesn't exist. Another important aspect of the Van Tillian apologetical program is the distinction between proof and persuasion. According to the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, man has ample proof in all of creation of God's existence and attributes but chooses to suppress it. Van Til likewise claimed that there are valid arguments to prove that the God of the Bible exists but that the unbeliever would not necessarily be persuaded by them because of his suppression of the truth, and therefore the apologist, he said, must present the truth regardless of whether anyone is actually persuaded by it (Frame notes that the apologist is here akin to the psychiatrist who presents the truth about the paranoid's delusions, trusting that his patient knows the truth at some level and can accept it‚Äîthough Frame, as a Calvinist, would say the special intervention of God in the Holy Spirit is also required for the unbeliever to accept ultimate truths.) An implication of this position is that all arguments are \\"person relative\\" in the sense that one non-Christian might be persuaded by a particular argument and another might not be, depending on their background and experiences; even if the argument constitutes logically valid proof.  Clarkian presuppositionalism  Gordon Clark and his followers treat the truth of the Scriptures as the axiom of their system. Like all axioms, this axiom is considered to be self- evident truth, not to be proven, but used for proof. Theologians and philosophers strongly influenced by Dr. Clark include Francis Schaeffer, Carl F. H. Henry, Ronald Nash, Fuller Theological Seminary President Edward J. Carnell, R. C. Sproul (though with many published reservations) and John Robbins of the Trinity Foundation. Clark's system has been described by Gary Crampton as, \\"The 66 books of the Old and New Testaments are self-attesting and self-authenticating. Scripture stands in judgment over all books and ideas, and it is to be judged by no person or thing. The Bible alone is the Word of God. This is the Reformed principle of sola Scriptura.\\"http://www.trinityfoundation.org/journal.php?id=276 However, the worldview that results from the axiom may be tested for consistency and comprehensiveness.. Testing for internal contradiction exemplifies Clark's strict reliance on the laws of logic (he famously translates the first verse of the Gospel of John as \\"In the beginning was the Logic, and the Logic was with God, and the Logic was God.\\") Thus, in order to invalidate non-Christian worldviews, one must simply show how a different presupposition results in necessary logical contradictions, while showing that presupposing the Bible leads to no logical contradiction. By contrast, some Van Tillians have suggested that God as He has revealed Himself in Scripture reveals apparent paradoxes.. However, Clark allowed that presupposing axioms (or \\"first principles\\") themselves do not make a philosophical system true, including his own; the fact that all worldviews he examined other than Christianity had internal contradictions only made Christianity highly more probable as truth, but not necessarily so. Nonetheless, he believed that this method was effective in many practical cases (when arguing against, for instance, secular humanism or dialectical materialism) and that, in the end, each of us must simply choose (that is, make an informed selection) from among seemingly consistent worldviews the one that most adequately answers life's questions and seems the most internally coherent. Some Van Tillian critics suggest that the concept of coherence itself must be defined in terms of Christian presuppositions but is instead being used by Clark as a \\"neutral\\" principle for discerning the truth of any proposition. Using this approach, Clark labored to expose the contradictions of many worldviews that were in vogue in his day and to defend the Christian worldview by proving its consistency over and against those who attacked it. His unflagging use of logic sometimes led him to what most Reformed theologians consider rather unorthodox ideas on such topics as the problem of evil‚Äîtopics which are most often treated by theologians as paradoxes or apparent contradictions not resolvable by human logic. But Clark famously rejected the idea that Scripture teaches paradoxes and notion of \\"apparent contradiction\\", asking \\"apparent to whom?\\". He described an alleged biblical paradox as nothing more than \\"a charley-horse between the ears that can be eliminated by rational massage.\\" With regard to other schools of apologetics, Clark suggested that the cosmological argument was not just unpersuasive but also logically invalid (because it begged the question), and he similarly dismissed the other Thomistic arguments. As a staunch critic of all varieties of empiricism, he did not tend to make much use of evidential arguments, which yield likelihoods and probabilities rather than logical certainties (that is, either coherence or incoherence).

Born in Lubbock, Texas, she is best known for her long-running role as Nancy Hughes McClosky on the soap opera As the World Turns. After appearing in the soap opera for some 50 years, at the time of her death she was the longest serving actor on an American soap opera. She played the role of Trudy Bauer during the initial TV years of Guiding Light in the early 1950s. She appeared on the early soap Valiant Lady, as well as on primetime programs including The World of Mr. Sweeney, Mister Peepers, Inner Sanctum, and the Philco-Goodyear Playhouse. Biography Helen Losee Wagner was born on September 3, 1918, in Lubbock, Texas, one of two daughters of Charles and Janette (n√©e Tinker) Wagner. She studied music and drama at Monmouth College in Illinois where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1938. Before signing a 13-week contract for As the World Turns in 1956, Ms. Wagner had been a singer and stage actress, sometimes working as a church soloist to pay the rent. She had roles in Sunny River, Oklahoma! and The Bad Seed on Broadway. In 1954 she married Robert Willey, an actor and theater producer. He died in 2009. Wagner died of cancer on May 1, 2010, at the age of 91. As the World Turns Wagner played the soap opera's matriarch, Nancy Hughes, from its debut on April 2, 1956, until her death. She was acknowledged by the Guinness World Records for having the longest run in a single role on television, a position she held until 2010.CNN.com: Fifty years on 'As the World Turns' , March 30, 2006. In fact, Wagner spoke the show's very first line, \\"Good morning, dear,\\"As The World Turns Matriarch Wagner Dies at 91 and would go on to witness its many broadcast transformations. As The World Turns premiered as a 30-minute program and was the first soap opera, along with The Edge of Night, to do so. Up until that time, all soaps ran for only 15 minutes. Advertisers were skeptical at first, finding it hard to believe that the average housewife had the attention span to tune to one soap opera for a half-hour. The show would hit ratings gold within three years. After a number of years of broadcasting live and in black-and-white, it would eventually go on to air on tape and in color and expand to a full hour. On November 22, 1963, Wagner inadvertently became part of broadcast history. About ten minutes into that day's episode of As the World Turns, a scene featuring her character was interrupted by Walter Cronkite's first news bulletin that President John F. Kennedy had been shot in Dallas (this bulletin was audio only, as the studio camera was not ready until 20 minutes later). Wagner later remembered that she and actor Santos Ortega, who played Grandpa Hughes, continued with the scene as it was broadcast live, unaware of the unfolding tragedy until they were told about it during a commercial break.As The World Turns (November 22, 1963 telecast), tvfanforums.net; accessed October 16, 2014. Wagner took some breaks from the role, both voluntary and involuntary. After six months with the show, creator Irna Phillips fired her because she did not favor the way Wagner poured coffee. After overwhelming pressure to hire her back, Phillips did so begrudgingly. Wagner would leave of her own accord in the early 1980s. Dissatisfied with then-producer Mary-Ellis Bunim's decision to showcase the Hughes family less, Wagner and co-star Don MacLaughlin walked away from the show after vocal dissent in the press. With As The World Turns having fallen from the top spot in the Nielsen TV ratings, Bunim wanted to shift the show's focus to the younger generation. Wagner eventually returned to the role in 1985 and in 1986 she and an ailing MacLaughlin, who played her on-screen husband, were prominently featured in the show's 30th anniversary episode. The storyline had their characters celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary. After McLaughlin's death in 1986, the Nancy Hughes character became a widow. She later met and married Dan McClosky (Dan Frazer) and was subsequently part of a storyline in which Dan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. After it culminated in Dan's death, Wagner faced many years with little to no part in the story. She returned to the screen with a pivotal role in a 2004 storyline revolving around her grandson's marriage to na√Øve teenager Alison Stewart (played by Jessica Dunphy). In 2005, 2006, and 2007, Wagner averaged around three appearances a month on the serial. She was prominently featured in the show's 50th anniversary episode in April 2006. Her lack of screen time was attributed by some to the failing health of her real-life husband, Robert Willey. But press reports later stated that show producer Procter & Gamble had actually taken Wagner off contract and only used her on special occasions. Fans were vocal in their displeasure with Wagner's lack of story. When asked how long she would keep playing Nancy, Wagner replied \\"As long as I can and they want me.\\" After a prolonged absence, Nancy returned to the screen on November 25, 2009 for the show's Thanksgiving episode and also on December 29, 2009. She appeared again on April 2 and April 5, 2010. Her final appearance on As the World Turns, taped in March, aired on June 1, 2010 ‚Äî exactly a month after her death. Wagner's death was finally addressed in episodes broadcast on August 30 and 31, 2010. On August 30, Nancy's son Bob Hughes discovers that his mother has died quietly in her apartment. In the following episode, family and friends remember Nancy, with numerous flashbacks to scenes from vintage episodes. Wagner's death from undisclosed causes came less than two months before As The World Turns taped its final episode. CBS announced on December 9, 2009, that it was cancelling the show after 54 years on the air. Many fans had hoped that Wagner would be able to close the series with the line \\"Good night, dear,\\" just as she had uttered \\"Good morning, dear\\" as the first line of the program back in 1956. The last episode was taped on June 23, 2010, and aired on September 17, 2010. Although Wagner played Nancy for more than 50 years, she never won a Daytime Emmy Award for her work. She was presented with a \\"Lifetime Achievement\\" Emmy in May 2004. Alma mater In 1988, Wagner's alma mater, Monmouth College (Illinois), awarded her an honorary degree of \\"Doctor of Humane Letters\\". The following year, Wagner chaired a national committee that raised more than $1 million to replace the school's \\"little theater\\" with a state-of-the-art facility. On opening night in Monmouth's new Wells Theater, Wagner played the role of Eleanor in The Lion in Winter.Helen Wagner profile, monm.edu; accessed October 16, 2014.

It was founded in 1909 as a research department of the Royal Marsden Hospital and joined the University of London in 2003. It has been responsible for a number of breakthrough discoveries, including that the basic cause of cancer is damage to DNA. The ICR occupies sites in Chelsea, Central London and Sutton, southwest London. The ICR provides both taught postgraduate degree programmes and research degrees and currently has around 340 students. Together with the Royal Marsden Hospital the ICR forms the largest comprehensive cancer centre in Europe, and was ranked first amongst all British higher education institutions in the Times Higher Education 2014 Research Excellence Framework Table of Excellence. In clinical medicine, 83% and in biological sciences, 96% of the ICR‚Äôs academic research was assessed to be world leading or internationally excellent (4* or 3*). The annual income of the institution for 2015-16 was ¬£162.1 million of which ¬£61.7 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of ¬£110.2 million. The ICR receives its external grant funding from the government body the Higher Education Funding Council for England, from government research council bodies and from charities including the Wellcome Trust, Cancer Research UK, Breast Cancer Now and Bloodwise. It also receives voluntary income from legacies and from public and corporate donations. The ICR also runs a number of fundraising appeals and campaigns which help support a variety of cancer research projects. Sites Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton The ICR occupies two sites in Chelsea, Central London which include the Chester Beatty Laboratories and the ICR corporate offices. A third site in Sutton, Southwest London, houses more research facilities.  Research The ICR pursues its research focused into three main research themes: genetic epidemiology, molecular pathology, and therapeutic development. These areas of research are essential for the development of personalised cancer medicine. Towards this aim, the ICR and The Royal Marsden have completed a dedicated ¬£17 million Centre for Molecular Pathology (CMP) which opened on the Sutton site on 20 November 2012. The centre exploits the increasing availability of information about the genetic make-up of different cancer types, in order to design new \\"personalised\\" treatments that target cancers' specific molecular defects. The CMP also aims to develop molecular diagnostic techniques that will accurately predict who will benefit most from a treatment, ensuring a patient receives the optimum drug(s) for the best possible outcome. The CMP will build on the organisations' existing expertise in breast, prostate and paediatric cancers, while providing opportunities for new developments in other cancers such as gastrointestinal, renal, gynaecological, melanoma, head & neck cancers and sarcomas. In March 2016, the ICR opened a ¬£20 million Centre for Cancer Imaging that brings together experts in a range of different imaging techniques working together to develop better cancer diagnostic and treatment techniques. The organisation‚Äôs research direction is set out in the ICR Scientific Strategy 2010‚Äì2015, which aims to develop key research areas while enhancing partnership affiliations. Its four objectives are to maintain, develop and exploit the unique relationship with the Marsden; to ensure a balanced portfolio of basic and applied research; to develop treatment regimes to the genetic makeup of patient and tumour (personalised medicine) and to recruit, retain and motivate the best staff.  Teaching  The ICR runs an MSc in Oncology programme, which is a modular course aimed primarily at Specialist Registrars in Clinical and Medical Oncology. The course has exit points at Certificate, Diploma and MSc degree level.  History   1909 to 1970  The ICR was founded in 1909, when a new laboratory building adjoining The Cancer Hospital (later named the Royal Marsden Hospital) was established with Alexander Paine as its first Director. In 1910 Robert Knox was appointed to head the Electrical and Radio-therapeutic Department at The Cancer Hospital and established the first professionally designed X-ray Department for treatment and diagnosis in Britain. The Cancer Hospital Research Institute was officially opened by Prince Arthur, the Duke of Connaught in 1911. In 1921 Professor Archibald Leitch was appointed Director of The Cancer Hospital Research Institute. The Institute became a postgraduate School of the University of London in 1927. In 1931 Professor Sir Ernest Kennaway FRS became Director of the Institute. In 1932 a research team led by Professor Kennaway fractionated coal tar and isolated benzo[a]pyrene, which he identified as one of the chemical constituents that induced cancer in mice. These were the first research findings to show that a pure chemical substance can cause cancer. In 1936 Professor Kennaway proposed the potential of a link between smoking and lung cancer. The Cancer Hospital Research Institute moved to a new site on Fulham Road in Chelsea in 1939 and was renamed the Chester Beatty Research Institute. In 1946 Professor Sir Alexander Haddow FRS FRSE (1907-1976) became the Director of the Chester Beatty Research Institute. He remained in the role until 1969, In 1947, while conducting research at the Institute, Professor David Galton became the first physician in the world to use aminopterin (the forerunner of the methotrexate drug) in the treatment of adult leukaemia, producing remission in some cancer patients. During the 1940s Haddow established a Clinical Chemotherapy Research Unit ‚Äì the first such unit in Europe ‚Äì in partnership with the Royal Marsden Hospital and under Galton's leadership. The partnership was unique at the time in being able to take the drug discoveries directly into a partner hospital for clinical trials in cancer patients. The unit led to the Institute's discovery of three successful chemotherapy drugs in the 1950s: busulphan (Myleran), chlorambucil (Leukeran) and melphalan (Alkeran). In 1952 the ICR's Eric Boyland had proposed that certain chemicals that cause cancer (carcinogens) react with DNA through an alkylation mechanism that damaged the DNA molecule. In follow-up research at the ICR in 1964, Professors Peter Brookes and Philip Lawley proved that chemical carcinogens act by damaging DNA, leading to mutations and the formation of tumours, proving that cancer is a genetic disease based on mutational events. In 1954 the Institute was officially renamed The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR). The ICR established a second campus in Sutton, Surrey in 1956. Whilst working at the ICR in 1961, Professor Jacques Miller discovered the immunological role of the thymus, as the repository of a special class of lymphocytes (T cells) essential for the mounting of an immune response.  1970 to 2000 Scientists at the ICR were instrumental in the development of one of the world's most widely used anti-cancer drugs, carboplatin (Paraplatin). Carboplatin‚Äôs development began in 1970 after scientists in the United States discovered that the platinum-based compound cisplatin was effective against many tumours ‚Äì but had serious side-effects. A team of ICR and RMH scientists and clinicians including Professors Kenneth Harrap and Tom Connors, Hilary Calvert and Hospital Consultant Eve Wiltshaw recognised its potential but also the need for a less toxic alternative. In collaboration with the chemical and precious metal company Johnson Matthey plc the ICR scientists evaluated some 300 different platinum-containing molecules and developed a series of second-generation compounds, of which carboplatin was selected as the lead. The first clinical trial of carboplatin was carried out in 1981 and it was launched commercially as Parplatin (manufactured by Bristol-Myers) in 1986. As of 2012 carboplatin is in use for a range of cancers including ovarian and lung. For the development of these platinum- based anticancer drugs the ICR, together with The Royal Marsden Hospital and Johnson Matthey plc, received the Queen‚Äôs Award for Technological Achievement in 1991. During the 1980s ICR scientists including Professors Hilary Calvert, and Ken Harrap and Ann Jackman developed raltitrexed (Tomudex) at the ICR, a drug active for the treatment of colon and other cancers. In 1983 research teams at the Chester Beatty Laboratory of the ICR led by Professors Chris Marshall FRS and Alan Hall FRS discovered N-RAS, one of the first human cancer transforming genes (oncogenes). Professor Alan Hall went on in 1992 to discover that the molecular mechanism for the motility behaviour of animal cells (cell to cell attachment and cell movement) is through control of cytoskeletal assembly by specific GTPase-proteins, known as Rho and Rac. The discovery is of fundamental significance in cancer research since cell motility is a key feature of cancer cell behaviour during metastasis (the spread of tumours around the human body). In 1994 an ICR team led by Michael Stratton discovered the gene BRCA2, which has been linked to breast cancer, prostate cancer and ovarian cancer. Alan Ashworth's team in the Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre at the ICR established the connection between mutations in the BRCA2 gene and the operation of DNA repair pathways in cancer cells. This later led to the development of a PARP inhibitor drug, olaparib, which targets the DNA repair pathways of cancer cells. A Phase I trial of olaparib found in June 2009 that tumours shrank or stabilised for more than half of patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. It is believed that the drug may also be useful in other patients whose cancer it is linked to an error in their DNA repair pathway. In 1999 the Chester Beatty Laboratory in Chelsea was redeveloped and extended to incorporate the Breakthrough Toby Robins Breast Cancer Research Centre, which was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1999.  2000 to present  In 2000 Professor Michael Stratton at the ICR initiated the Cancer Genome Project, which was aimed at capitalizing on the knowledge from the Human Genome sequence to screen all human genes in cancer cells to identify those genes responsible for specific cancers. The project was established at the genome sequencing facilities of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute near Cambridge, of which Professor Stratton is now the Director. One of the first major achievements of the Cancer Genome Project has been the characterisation of the cancer gene BRAF in collaboration with ICR scientists Professors Chris Marshall and Richard Marais. The research by the ICR team, published in June 2002, revealed that damage to the BRAF gene could cause up to 70 per cent of melanoma skin cancers. This has been instrumental in speeding up the development of new drugs for the treatment of malignant melanoma. Since 2002 the ICR has been working to develop drugs that inhibit BRAF in melanoma and other cancers where the gene is defective. In the five years from 2004/05, the ICR developed on average two drug development candidates per year. Since 2006, it has licensed three novel series of anti- cancer drugs to major pharmaceutical companies: Hsp90 inhibitors to Novartis, PKB inhibitors to AstraZeneca and PI3Kinase inhibitors to Genentech. The PIl3Kinase inhibitor GDC-0941, licensed to Genentech by Piramed, is thought to have potential in a range of human cancers. In laboratory experiments, ICR scientists found that the drug reduced the growth of glioblastoma (the most common form of brain tumour), it decreased the growth of ovarian tumours and in other studies, it was active against cell lines derived from other human cancers. In conjunction with The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, the ICR tested a promising new prostate cancer drug called abiraterone, which it discovered and developed. A randomised placebo-controlled Phase III trial reported in October 2010 that abiraterone could extend survival in some men with late stage prostate cancer. The trial, funded by Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, included 1,195 patients from 13 countries whose advanced prostate cancer had stopped responding to standard therapies. Abiraterone extended the average overall survival of patients from 10.9 months to 14.8 months compared to a placebo, without many of the unpleasant side-effects associated with conventional chemotherapy. The FDA in April 2011 approved the drug for sale in the US under the trade name Zytiga.

Established in 1823 as the London Mechanics' Institute by its founder, Sir George Birkbeck, and its supporters, Jeremy Bentham, J. C. Hobhouse and Henry Brougham, Birkbeck is one of the few universities to specialise in evening higher education in the United Kingdom. Birkbeck's main building is based in the area of Bloomsbury in London Borough of Camden in Central London. In partnership with University of East London, Birkbeck has an additional large campus in Stratford, next to the Theatre Royal. Birkbeck offers over 200 undergraduate and postgraduate programmes that can be studied either part-time or full-time, though nearly all lectures are given in the evening. Birkbeck's academic activities are organised into five constituent faculties which are subdivided into nineteen departments. Birkbeck, being part of the University of London, shares the University's academic standards and awards University of London degrees. In common with the other University of London colleges, Birkbeck has also secured its own independent degree awarding powers, which were confirmed by the Privy Council in July 2012. The quality of degrees awarded by Birkbeck was confirmed by the UK Quality Assurance Agency following institutional audits in 2005 and 2010. Birkbeck is a member of academic organisations such as the Association of Commonwealth Universities and the European University Association. The university is also a member of the Screen Studies Group, London. The university's Centre for Brain Function and Development was awarded The Queen's Anniversary Prize for its brain research in 2005. Birkbeck's alumni include 5 Nobel laureates, numerous political leaders, members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and a British prime minister. History Founding Sir George Birkbeck, founder of Birkbeck, University of Londonalt= Part of the main Birkbeck campus in Bloomsbury, showing the main entrance (on the right). In 1823, Sir George Birkbeck, a physician and graduate of the University of Edinburgh and an early pioneer of adult education, founded the then \\"London Mechanics' Institute\\" at a meeting at the Crown and Anchor Tavern on the Strand. More than two thousand people attended. However the idea was not universally popular and some accused Birkbeck of \\"scattering the seeds of evil.\\" In 1825, two years later, the institute moved to the Southampton Buildings on Chancery Lane. In 1830, the first female students were admitted. In 1858, changes to the University of London's structure resulting in an opening up of access to the examinations for its degree. The Institute became the main provider of part-time university education. In 1866, the Institute changed its name to the Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution. In 1885, Birkbeck moved to the Breams Building, on Fetter Lane, where it would remain for the next sixty-seven years. In 1904, Birkbeck Students' Union was established. Birkbeck College In 1907, Birkbeck's name was shortened to \\"Birkbeck College\\". In 1913, a review of the University of London (which had been restructured in 1900) successfully recommended that Birkbeck become a constituent college, although the outbreak of the First World War delayed this until 1920. The Royal Charter was granted in 1926.Charter, Statutes and Standing Orders Birkbeck College, 16 December 1994. In 1921, the college's first female professor, Dame Helen Gwynne-Vaughan, began teaching botany. Other distinguished faculty in the inter-war years included Nikolaus Pevsner, J. D. Bernal, and Cyril Joad. During the Second World War, Birkbeck was the only central University of London college not to relocate out of the capital. In 1941, the library suffered a direct hit during The Blitz but teaching continued. During the war the College organised lunch time extramural lectures for the public given by, among others, Joad, Pevsner and Harold Nicolson. In 1952, the college moved to its present location in Malet Street. Current status In 2002, the university was renamed Birkbeck, University of London, having dropped the word College from its branding, but \\"Birkbeck College, University of London\\" remains the institution's formal legal name.Birkbeck, University of London, http://www.bbk.ac.uk/about-us/charitable-status \\"About Birkbeck > Charitable Status\\" Retrieved 28 December 2019. In 2003, following a major redevelopment, its Malet Street building was reopened by the Chancellor of the University of London, The Princess Royal. In 2006, Birkbeck announced that it had been granted ¬£5 million by the Higher Education Funding Council for England to expand its provision into east London, working with the University of East London. The partnership was formally launched on 21 November 2006 and is called Birkbeck Stratford. Birkbeck is one of the largest colleges of the University of London not to award its own degrees. Although it has held its own degree awarding powers since 2012, Birkbeck has chosen to hold these in reserve, preferring to award University of London degrees. It also offers many continuing education courses leading to certificates and diplomas, foundation degrees, and short courses. The former main entrance of Birkbeck College; the new entrance is on the other side of this building. The School of Continuing Education In 1876, the London Society for the Extension of University Education was founded, boosting the aims of encouraging working people to undertake higher education. In 1988, the Department of Extra-Mural Studies of the University of London was incorporated into Birkbeck, becoming at first the Centre for Extramural Studies. In 1903, it became the Department of Extra-Mural Studies of the University of London and it was integrated into Birkbeck in 1988 as the School of Continuing Education. In 2009, the Faculty of Lifelong Learning was incorporated into the main College structure. Campus and location The interior of the new library. Birkbeck College restaurant Birkbeck is principally located between Malet Street and Woburn Square in Bloomsbury, with a number of institutes, teaching hospitals, and scientific laboratories on nearby streets. The Friends House is also partially owned by Birkbeck Law School. The School of Arts, including the Department of English & Humanities, is housed in Virginia Woolf's former Gordon Square residence in Bloomsbury. Other notable former residents of this house include John Maynard Keynes, Vanessa Bell, and Lydia Lopokova. The Gordon Square building includes the Birkbeck Cinema and the Peltz Gallery. Many Birkbeck classes are taught at other locations around the Bloomsbury area, due to a combination of Birkbeck's widening participation strategy to make higher education accessible and also because nearly all classes on one day are taught at the same time, resulting in heavy competition for limited space. Birkbeck expanded into east London, in conjunction with the University of East London. The project is known as Birkbeck Stratford. The campus officially opened in November 2013. Organisation Faculties and departments The University consists of five schools that comprise a total of 19 diverse academic departments, which are: * Department of English, Theatre and Creative Writing * Department of Cultures and Languages * Department of History of Art * Department of Film, Media and Cultural Studies * Department of Computer Science and Information Systems * Department of Economics, Mathematics and Statistics * Department of Management * Department of Organizational Psychology * Department of Law * Department of Criminology * Department of Biological Sciences * Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences * Department of Psychological Sciences * Department of Applied Linguistics and Communication * Department of Geography * Department of History, Classics and Archaeology * Department of Philosophy * Department of Politics * Department of Psychosocial Studies Academic profile Research and teaching The Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities (BIR) was established in 2004, with the renowned but controversial Slovenian philosopher Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek appointed as International Director. According to its website, the Institute aims to, among other things, \\"engage with important public issues of our time through a series of open debates, lectures, seminars and conferences\\" and \\"foster and promote a climate of interdisciplinary research and collaboration among academics and researchers\\". The launch of the Institute wasn't without controversy, provoking an article in The Observer newspaper titled \\"What have intellectuals ever done for the world?\\" which criticised the ostensible irrelevance and elitism of contemporary public intellectuals. The current director of the institute is Costas Douzinas. 2004 also saw Birkbeck enter into a research and teaching collaboration with the Institute of Education, jointly founding the London Knowledge Lab. This interdisciplinary research institute brings together social scientists and computer scientists to address research questions about technology and learning.'ALT Lab Group: London Knowledge Lab' page.

Its permanent and adjunct faculty include figures such as Tom McCarthy, Colin MacCabe, Laura Mulvey, Steven Connor, Marina Warner, Juliet Mitchell, Stuart Hall, Roger Scruton, Salman Rushdie, Tilda Swinton as well as Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. Its current chair is Anthony Julius. Torrington Square and Birkbeck's Clore Management Centre (right) Since 2003, when David Latchman of UCL became Master of the Birkbeck, he has forged closer relations between these two University of London colleges, and personally maintains departments at both. Joint research centres include the UCL/Birkbeck Institute for Earth and Planetary Sciences, UCL/Birkbeck/IoE Centre for Educational Neuroscience, UCL/Birkbeck Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, and Birkbeck-UCL Centre for Neuroimaging. Science research at Birkbeck has a notable tradition. Physicist David Bohm who made notable contributions to the theory of Quantum mechanics was professor of Theoretical Physics from 1961‚Äì87, Nobel Laureates Aaron Klug at the Department of crystallography, Derek Barton at the Department of Chemistry together with eminent physicist Roger Penrose and David Bohm at the Department of Physics. Computer scientist Kathleen Booth wrote the first assembly language. Birkbeck is part of the Institute of Structural Molecular Biology, which includes the Bloomsbury Centre for Structural biology, established in 1998. This is a collaborative venture between Birkbeck College and University College London and is a leading academic centre for translating gene sequences and determining protein structure and function. It also includes the Bloomsbury Centre for Bioinformatics, a collaborative venture also between Birkbeck College and University College London for research into Bioinformatics, Genomics, Systems Biology, GRID computing and Text mining. Birkbeck was ranked 13th in The Guardian's 2001 Research Assessment Exercise and 26th in the Times Higher Education's equivalent table. In the 2008 RAE results, Birkbeck ranked in the top 25% of UK multi-faculty Higher Education Institutions. The RAE rated the quality of research in a range of subjects at 159 Higher Education Institutions in the UK. Birkbeck submissions from Earth Sciences, Psychology, History, Classics and Archaeology and History of Art, Film and Visual Media were rated in the top five nationally. In REF2014, half of Birkbeck's submissions were rated in the top 20 nationally, and eight submissions received 100% ranking for Research Environment. 73% of Birkbeck's research was rated \\"world-leading\\" (4*) or \\"internationally excellent\\" (3*).  Rankings  Birkbeck's Centre for Brain Function and Development was awarded The Queen's Anniversary Prize for its brain research in 2005. In 2010, Birkbeck was shortlisted for the Times Higher Education University of the Year Award. In 2019, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranked Birkbeck 85th in the world for Psychology. The university is constantly ranked in the top 100 in the world by QS World University Rankings for English Language & Literature and Philosophy. Internationally, Birkbeck is ranked within the top 350 universities in the world by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2020 and QS World University Rankings 2020. In 2018, Birkbeck announced that it will withdraw from UK university rankings because their methodologies unfairly penalise it, since \\"despite having highly-rated teaching and research, other factors caused by its unique teaching model and unrelated to its performance push it significantly down the ratings\\". Students' Union The Birkbeck Students' Union (BBKSU) was founded in 1904 and was one of the founding members of the National Union of Students. Initially governed by a Council, elected from and responsible to the students, today it is governed jointly by a Student Council, Executive Committee, Board of Trustees and Clubs & Societies Committee. Students initially paid an annual membership fee to join, but students are now automatically registered as members when they enrol onto a course at the college. Birkbeck Students' Union offers a number of societies for students, as well as a various sports clubs that compete in the University of London league. It also provides student representation and support, a student magazine, a student shop and a bar. Birkbeck students also have access to the societies and clubs of the Student Central, whose building adjoins Birkbeck's Bloomsbury site. Notable people File:J.

Founding and history Following the Gulf War in 1991, a team led by Elias Bou Saab from the American Intercontinental University (AIU) visited the Persian Gulf to establish relationships with various ministries of higher education as well as the region‚Äôs schools. The lack of quality private education at the university level, coupled with an appreciation of the American model of higher education, led them to conduct a feasibility study on the prospects of establishing an American university in the Persian Gulf. The results confirmed the high level of interest and desire for a campus offering an American-accredited educational curriculum. It also became quickly apparent that the Emirate of Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, would be an ideal place to locate such an institution. Dubai was found to be a politically stable, cosmopolitan and outward-looking principality whose nearly non- existent private sector in higher education was just beginning to draw some attention. Elias Bou Saab moved to Dubai in 1995 in order to officially establish the American University in Dubai, which in turn would not have been possible without the commitment and support from the outset of H.H. Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE, Ruler of Dubai. To this day, His Highness continues his unlimited support for higher education in general and to the university in particular. The American University in Dubai opened its doors in October 1995 as a branch campus of the American Intercontinental University, a multinational educational institution currently based in Atlanta, Georgia. AUD‚Äôs initial enrollment was 165 students, over half of which were females. By the time former Secretary of State and Treasury James Baker gave the Keynote at AUD‚Äôs first commencement in 1998, enrollment had climbed to 499; and the Dubai government, as an expression of confidence, had decided to build a campus of 1,400,000 square feet for use by the university. AUD moved out of its initial premises to occupy this new, spacious, fully equipped campus in January 2000. Its enrollment at that time was 687. The year 2000 was also significant because it was in that year that the university was officially licensed by the UAE Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MOHE). The private sector for higher education had grown considerably since AUD‚Äôs founding, and the Ministry saw fit to establish a formal licensure and (subsequently) accreditation process. It was in 2000 that AUD's largest academic department ‚Äì Business Administration ‚Äì was organizationally designated as a School. In 2001, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the American University in Dubai (AUD) and the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta, GA to establish a School of Engineering. Representatives from Georgia Tech, including six senior faculty and administrative officers, visited AUD to finalize the adaptation of curricula to the requirements of the UAE. In December 2007, and for the third time since its opening in 1995, The American University in Dubai achieved independent accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), one of America's seven regional accrediting commissions.

By 1942, Bauer's maturity was evident as a newspaper reported, \\"Charita Bauer ... gets her first 'grown-up' role in a Broadway play in William Roos' 'Life of Reilly,' which opens on Apr. 29.\\" In 1944, she played in Good Morning, Corporal, on Broadway, with a reviewer commenting, \\"she's grown up and in this play has the role of a young woman ...\\" Radio Bauer first appeared on radio on WPAP in New York City as a child. She was active throughout the 1930s and 1940s on numerous radio dramas of the day, including Let's Pretend, Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons. The March of Time, The FBI in Peace and War, Suspense and other programs. She played Sarah O'Brien in Rose of My Dreams, Mary Aldrich in The Aldrich Family (a role she also played on the television version of the program ) and Judy Todhunter in David Harum. Bauer also played in Second Husband, The Parker Family, and Orphans of Divorce. On November 11, 1944, Bauer made her 2,000th radio broadcast when she appeared on Grand Central Station. Guiding Light She played headstrong and opinionated Bertha \\"Bert\\" Miller Bauer on the long- running soap The Guiding Light on radio from 1950 to 1956 and on TV from 1952 to 1985. In 1962, Bauer was featured in one of the earliest social issue storylines on American daytime television, as her character Bert was diagnosed with uterine cancer. The storyline helped millions of women realize the importance of regular checkups and pap smear screenings. Bauer received a record amount of mail from fans. To avoid confusion between her real life and her popular soap role, Charita asked the show's producers to name her TV son Michael after her own son Michael Crawford. (The show was aired live in the early days, and a mistake like addressing her TV son by an incorrect name would have been difficult to cover.) While her character was a spitfire in the earlier days, by the 1970s she had been relegated to the ceremonial role of town matriarch, a role she would fill for the show for the remainder of her run. Just before Thanksgiving 1983, complications from a blood clot forced Bauer to have her leg amputated. When she returned to the show in April 1984, her character's life mirrored her own. In the storyline, after visiting Aunt Meta in New York, Bert returned to Springfield and began experiencing pain in her leg (which had been fitted with a prosthesis by this time and mostly kept off camera). She ended up having her leg amputated just as the actress who played her had. For the first time in decades, Bert had to depend upon others to wait on her hand and foot, resulting in one of the series' most memorable stories. (Bert, sitting in a wheelchair at Cedars Hospital, told Josh Lewis, who had been paralyzed recently and had given up hope, that life itself was a miracle and never to forget it.) In a moving scene, Bert dropped a teacup. She tried to get it, but could not, and in sheer frustration, she burst into tears. As she went through rehab following her operation, camera shot closed in on her remaining leg as she learned to walk again, bringing even more realism to the storyline.

He was a candidate for the New Democratic Party in the 2004 federal election. In the late 1960s, McGrath's parish consisted mostly of fishermen. He became concerned with their plight. Fishermen at that time were getting just 2.5 cents a pound for their catch, and lived off credit supplied by merchants, rarely having a season that enabled them to climb out of debt. McGrath felt that the only way for fishermen to improve their situation was if they formed a union. McGrath and St. John's lawyer Richard Cashin created the Fish, Food and Allied Workers Union. The union today represents not only fishing people, but plant workers and many others and, with over 20,000 members, is the largest private-sector union in Newfoundland. In the late 1980s, McGrath started setting up adult education centres across the province, which provided key retraining when the cod fishery collapsed a few years later. McGrath was found dead in his home on July 28, 2009, a day after failing to appear in court to answer charges that he sexually abused a boy in 1982.

The film about a bumbling male fairy godmother named Murray (Short), who tries to help Annabel (Wilson) fulfill her wish that her father, a carriage driver, wins the leading role in a Broadway musical. It was the last film from director Michael Ritchie before his death in 2001.Nat Segaloff, Final Cuts: The Last Films of 50 Great Directors, Bear Manor Media 2013 p 247-248 Plot New York taxi cab driver Oliver Greening (Robert Pastorelli) aspires to be a performer on Broadway and, despite delivering an outstanding audition for a role in a musical based on A Tale of Two Cities, he loses out to veteran performer Tony Sable (Alan Campbell), simply for the fact Tony is considered to be a more bankable option, as Oliver's reputation as an actor is non-existent. Later that night, Annabel (Mara Wilson), Oliver's young daughter, fails to convince her elder brother Charlie (Francis Capra) that fairies exist, and after the two fall asleep, Annabel awakens to find Murray (Martin Short), a male fairy godmother, offering her one wish, which she uses for her father, asking for Murray to use his magic to secure him a role in the play. Hortence (Ruby Dee), the head of all fairy godmothers, is holding the annual meeting of the North American Fairy Godmothers Association (NAFGA). Due to Hortence's rule, all the fairy godmothers must check in their wands before the meeting. Claudia (Kathleen Turner), a former fairy godmother turned evil witch, has shown up at the meeting uninvited and intends to steal all the wands. She gives Hortence's receptionist, Rena (Teri Garr) a witch's apple that puts her to sleep, casts a spell on Hortence turning the head fairy paper-thin and binding her mouth with bricks, and locks all the fairy godmothers downstairs on her way to stealing the wands. Murray, however, arrives at the meeting late and never checks his wand, leaving it as the only wand Claudia doesn't have. Annabel realizes that Murray has left his magic wand behind and decides to return it to him, but Charlie breaks it. Murray and Annabel disappear to Nebraska, by way of a misconstrued spell cast by him to get out quickly. After he tries and fails to turn a selfish motel owner they meet there into a rabbit (turning him instead into a giant rabbi), the two end up back in Central Park. Because of Annabel's disappearing in an unexplained way, the school closes early. Charlie finds them. Annabel begs Murray to try to grant her wish now that they are close to her father, but due to yet another mishap by him, Oliver is turned into a statue. To fix the problem, the three of them go to NAFGA and ask for the help of Hortence, who is still under the effects of Claudia's spell. While Murray, Charlie and Rena (who has awoken from Claudia's sleeping spell) fix Murray's wand, Hortence tells Annabel of Claudia's plot and explains that the awry spell must be lifted before midnight, or Oliver will be doomed to remain a statue forever. Claudia, meanwhile, has been looking through the wands, searching for hers. After going through, she realizes it is missing and now belongs to Murray, and she is determined to obtain it. Annabel and Murray head to the theater and see Tony Sable, the selfish and conceited actor who is auditioning for Oliver's part. Knowing this could ruin her father's chance of being in the show, she asks Murray to sabotage the audition any way he can. First he tries to make it rain on the stage but it is dismissed as a simple technical problem and the audition continues. Then she asks him to give Sable a frog in his throat to impair his singing. He takes this wish too literally, and frogs start hopping out of Sable's mouth, shocking the cast and crew. Annabel and Murray celebrate, but Sable gets the part since Oliver has not shown up. Boots (Amanda Plummer), Claudia's terrier turned lackey who has been looking for Murray, finds them. Murray mentions the story of Brer Rabbit to Annabel and together they beg her not to take them to Claudia's lair so that she will. Claudia catches them, and demands them to tell her where her wand is. When Murray tries to persuade Annabel not to tell her, as punishment, Claudia changes her and Murray into ballerinas and makes them dance uncontrollably until Annabel agrees to tell her. However, Annabel is able to keep Claudia distracted until Charlie can return with the wand, Murray winning Boots' allegiance long enough to convince her to give him the wand. Claudia attempts to attack him, but Murray is able to trick her into firing a spell that draws her into a mirror, which is subsequently shattered. Murray, Charlie, and Annabel return to Central Park and restore Oliver just in time. He is given the part of Sable's understudy thanks to a producer who enjoyed his audition. In order to finally grant Annabel's wish, Murray appears backstage and causes Sable to slip on a bucket, and twist his ankle. The resultant temper tantrum gets him fired and Oliver, his understudy, is cast in his place. Charlie and Annabel watch the show with Murray and the other fairy godmothers including Hortence, who is now free from Claudia's spell.

The attack on Pearl Harbor led to the United States' involvement in World War II. The memorial, built in 1962, is visited by more than two million people annually. Accessible only by boat, it straddles the sunken hull of the battleship without touching it. Historical information about the attack, shuttle boats to and from the memorial, and general visitor services are available at the associated USS Arizona Memorial Visitor Center, which opened in 1980 and is operated by the National Park Service. The battleship's sunken remains were declared a National Historic Landmark on May 5, 1989. The USS Arizona Memorial is one of several sites in Hawaii that are part of the Pearl Harbor National Memorial. Memorial USS Arizona in the 1950s. Conception and funding During and following the end of World War II, Arizonas wrecked superstructure was removed and efforts began to erect a memorial at the remaining submerged hull. Robert Ripley, of Ripley's Believe It or Not! fame, visited Pearl Harbor in 1942. Six years later, in 1948, he did a radio broadcast from Pearl Harbor. Following that broadcast, with the help of his longtime friend Doug Storer, he got in contact with the Department of the Navy. He wrote letters to Rear Admiral J.J. Manning of the Bureau of Yards and Docks regarding his desire for a permanent memorial. A letter RAdm J.J. Manning to Robert Ripley regarding the need for a permanent Pearl Harbor memorial While Ripley's original idea for a memorial was disregarded due to the cost, the Navy continued with the idea of creating a memorial. The Pacific War Memorial Commission was created in 1949 to build a permanent memorial in Hawaii. Admiral Arthur W. Radford, commander of the Pacific Fleet, attached a flag pole to the main mast of the Arizona in 1950, and began a tradition of hoisting and lowering the flag. In that same year a temporary memorial was built above the remaining portion of the deckhouse.After The Battle magazine, Issue 38 Radford requested funds for a national memorial in 1951 and 1952, but was denied because of budget constraints during the Korean War. The Navy placed the first permanent memorial, a -tall basalt stone and plaque, over the mid-ship deckhouse on December 7, 1955.Bergman, p. 37. President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved the creation of a National Memorial in 1958. Enabling legislation required the memorial, budgeted at $500,000, be privately financed; however, $200,000 of the memorial cost was government subsidized. Principal contributions to the memorial included: * $50,000 Territory of Hawaii initial contribution in 1958 * $95,000 privately raised following a 1958 This Is Your Life television segment featuring Rear Admiral (ret.) Samuel G. Fuqua, Medal of Honor recipient and the senior surviving officer from the Arizona * $64,000 from a March 25, 1961 benefit concert by Elvis Presley, which coincidentally was his final live performance until 1968 * $40,000 from the sale of plastic models of the Arizona, in a partnership between the Fleet Reserve Association and Revell Model Company * $150,000 from federal funds in legislation initiated by Hawaii Senator Daniel Inouye in 1961 During planning stages, the memorial's purpose was the subject of competing visions. Some were eager to keep it a tribute to the sailors of the Arizona, while others expected a dedication to all who died in the Pacific theater. In the end, the legislation authorizing and funding the memorial (HR 44, 1961) declared that the Arizona would \\"be maintained in honor and commemoration of the members of the Armed Forces of the United States who gave their lives to their country during the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941.\\" Design left The national memorial was designed by Honolulu architect Alfred Preis, who was detained at Sand Island at the start of the war as an enemy of the country, because of his Austrian birth.Bergman, p. 36. The United States Navy specified the memorial be in the form of a bridge floating above the ship and accommodating 200 people. The structure has two peaks at each end connected by a sag in the center of the structure. Critics initially called the design a \\"squashed milk carton\\". The architecture of the USS Arizona Memorial is explained by Preis as, \\"Wherein the structure sags in the center but stands strong and vigorous at the ends, expresses initial defeat and ultimate victory ... The overall effect is one of serenity. Overtones of sadness have been omitted, to permit the individual to contemplate his own personal responses ... his innermost feelings.\\" Description \\"To the Memory of the Gallant Men Here Entombed and their shipmates who gave their lives in action on December 7, 1941, on the U.S.S. Arizona\\" ‚Äî inscription in marble with the names of Arizonas honored dead The national memorial has three main parts: entry, assembly room, and shrine. The central assembly room features seven large open windows on either wall and ceiling, to commemorate the date of the attack. Rumor says the 21 windows symbolically represents a 21-gun salute or 21 Marines standing at eternal parade rest over the tomb of the fallen, but guides at the site will confirm this was not the architect's intention. The memorial also has an opening in the floor overlooking the sunken decks. It is from this opening that visitors can pay their respects by tossing flowers in honor of the fallen sailors. In the past, leis were tossed in the water, but because string from leis poses a hazard to sea life, leis now are placed on guardrails in front of the names of the fallen. One of Arizonas three anchors is displayed at the visitor center's entrance. (One of the other two is at the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix.) One of the two ship's bells is in the visitor center. (Its twin is in the clock tower of the Student Memorial Center at the University of Arizona in Tucson.) The shrine at the far end is a marble wall that bears the names of all those killed on Arizona, protected behind velvet ropes. To the left of the main wall is a small plaque which bears the names of thirty or so crew members who survived the 1941 sinking. Any surviving crew members of Arizona (or their families on their behalf) can have their ashes interred within the wreck by U.S. Navy divers History The \\"tears of the Arizona\\". Oil slick visible on water's surface above the sunken battleship. The USS Arizona Memorial was formally dedicated on May 30, 1962 (Memorial Day) by Texas Congressman and Chairman of Veteran Affairs Olin E. Teague and future-Governor John A. Burns. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. While the wreck of the Arizona was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989, the memorial does not share this status. Rather, it is listed separately from the wreck on the National Register of Historic Places. The joint administration of the memorial by the United States Navy and the National Park Service was established on September 9, 1980. Oil leaking from the sunken battleship can still be seen rising from the wreckage to the water's surface. This oil is sometimes referred to as \\"the tears of the Arizona\\" or \\"black tears.\\" In a National Geographic feature published in 2001, concerns were expressed that the continued deterioration of the Arizonas bulkheads and oil tanks from saltwater corrosion could pose a significant environmental threat from a rupture, resulting in a significant release of oil. The National Park Service states it has an ongoing program that closely monitors the submerged vessel's condition. The Park Service, as part of its Centennial Initiative celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2016, developed a \\"mobile park\\" to tour the continental United States to increase exposure of the park. The mobile park also collected oral histories of the attack on Pearl Harbor. USS Missouri The and memorials. Upon the deck of the battleship in Tokyo Bay, the Japanese surrendered to United States General Douglas MacArthur and Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, ending World War II. In 1999, Missouri was moved to Pearl Harbor from the United States west coast and docked behind, and in line, with USS Arizona, placing it perpendicular to the USS Arizona Memorial. The pairing of the two ships became an evocative symbol of the beginning and end of the United States' participation in the war. USS Arizona Memorial staff initially criticized the placement of Missouri, saying the large battleship would \\"overshadow\\" the Arizona Memorial. To guard against this perception, Missouri was placed well back of the Arizona Memorial, and positioned in Pearl Harbor to prevent those participating in military ceremonies on Missouris aft decks from seeing the Arizona Memorial. The decision to have Missouris bow face the Memorial was intended to convey that Missouri now watches over the remains of Arizona so that those interred within Arizonas hull may rest in peace. These measures have helped preserve the identities of the Arizona Memorial and the Missouri Memorial, thereby improving the public's perception of having Arizona and Missouri in the same harbor.

Access to the USS Arizona Memorial is by U.S. Navy boat, for which a numbered ticket, obtained at the visitor center and valid for a designated departure time, is required. More than one million people visit the memorial each year. Because of the large number of visitors and the limited number of boat departures, the 4,500 tickets available each day are often fully allocated by mid-morning. Before boarding the boat for the short trip to the Memorial, visitors view a 23-minute documentary film depicting the attack on Pearl Harbor. Touring of the Memorial is self-guided. The National Park Service Web site provides visitor information, including hours of operation and ticketing advisories.

On May 6, 2018, boat transportation to the memorial was suspended after one of the vessel operators noticed a crack on its outside. Although repairs were made, the cracks reappeared. The memorial was closed on May 26, 2018, and remained closed until fall 2019, when it was announced it will be re-opening to the public on September 1, 2019. However, boat tours around the memorial and the other ships on Battleship Row continue to be made.

Arizona is no longer in commission, but is an active U.S. military cemetery. As survivors of the attack on Arizona die, many choose either to have their ashes scattered in the water over the ship, or to have their urns placed within the well of the barbette of Turret No. 4. As a special tribute to the ship and her lost crew, the United States flag flies from the flagpole, which is attached to the severed mainmast of the sunken battleship. The USS Arizona National Memorial was one of the nine major historical sites incorporated into the wide-ranging World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument, established by Congress in 2008 and dedicated on December 7, 2010. The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act divided the monument by the three states in which it was located, naming the Hawaii site as Pearl Harbor National Memorial. Since it was formally dedicated in 1962, every U.S. President has made a pilgrimage to the memorial, presenting a wreath and scattering flowers over Arizona in honor of the Americans who perished there. On December 27, 2016, Japanese Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe visited the memorial with President Barack Obama and paid respects to fallen service members there.

The composer of over 300 titles, including the jazz standards \\"Lullaby of Birdland\\" and \\"Conception\\", and had multiple albums on the Billboard charts during the 1950s, 1960s, 1980s and 1990s. He died of heart failure in New York City, at the age of 91. Biography Early life Born in Battersea, London, Shearing was the youngest of nine children. He was born blind to working-class parents: his father delivered coal and his mother cleaned trains in the evening. He started to learn piano at the age of three and began formal training at Linden Lodge School for the Blind, where he spent four years. Though he was offered several scholarships, Shearing opted to perform at a local pub, the Mason's Arms in Lambeth, for \\"25 bob a week\\" playing piano and accordion. He joined an all- blind band, Claude Bampton's Blind Orchestra, during that time, and was influenced by the records of Teddy Wilson and Fats Waller. Shearing made his first BBC radio broadcast during this time, after befriending Leonard Feather, with whom he started recording in 1937. In 1940, Shearing joined Harry Parry's popular band. In around 1942 he was recruited by St√©phane Grappelli (domiciled in London during World War II) to join his band, which appeared at Hatchets Restaurant in Piccadilly in the early years of the war, and subsequently toured as \\"the Grappelly Swingtette\\" from 1943 onwards. Shearing won six consecutive Top Pianist Melody Maker polls from this time onwards. Around that time he was also a member of George Evans's Saxes 'n' Sevens band. United States years In 1947, Shearing emigrated to the United States, where his harmonically complex style mixing swing, bop and modern classical influences gained popularity. One of his first performances was at the Hickory House. He performed with the Oscar Pettiford Trio and led a jazz quartet with Buddy DeFranco, which led to contractual problems, since Shearing was under contract to MGM and DeFranco to Capitol Records. In 1949, he formed the first George Shearing Quintet, a band with Margie Hyams (vibraphone), Chuck Wayne (guitar), later replaced by Toots Thielemans (listed as John Tillman), John Levy (bass), and Denzil Best (drums). This line-up recorded for Discovery, Savoy, and MGM, including the immensely popular single \\"September in the Rain\\" (MGM), which sold over 900,000 copies; \\"my other hit\\" to accompany \\"Lullaby of Birdland\\". Shearing said of this hit that it was \\"as accidental as it could be.\\" Shearing's interest in classical music resulted in some performances with concert orchestras in the 1950s and 1960s, and his solos frequently drew upon the music of Satie, Delius, and Debussy for inspiration. He became known for a piano technique known as \\"The Shearing Sound\\", a type of double melody block chord, with an additional fifth part that doubles the melody an octave lower. With the piano playing these five voices, Shearing would double the top voice with the vibraphone and the bottom voice with the guitar to create his signature sound.(This piano technique is also known as \\"locked hands\\" and the jazz organist Milt Buckner is generally credited with inventing it.) In 1956, Shearing became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He continued to play with his quintet, with augmented players through the years, and recorded with Capitol until 1969. He created his own label, Sheba, that lasted a few years. Along with dozens of musical stars of his day, Shearing appeared on ABC's The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom. Earlier, he had appeared on the same network's reality show, The Comeback Story, in which he discussed how to cope with blindness.  Later career  In 1970, he began to \\"phase out his by- now-predictable quintet\\" and disbanded the group in 1978. One of his more notable albums during this period was The Reunion, with George Shearing (Verve 1976), made in collaboration with bassist Andy Simpkins and drummer Rusty Jones, and featuring St√©phane Grappelli, the musician with whom he had debuted as a sideman decades before. Later, Shearing played in a trio, as a soloist, and increasingly in a duo. Among his collaborations were sets with the Montgomery Brothers, Marian McPartland, Brian Q. Torff, Jim Hall, Hank Jones, Niels-Henning √òrsted Pedersen and Kenny Davern. In 1979, Shearing signed with Concord Records, and recorded for the label with Mel Torm√©. This collaboration garnered Shearing and Torm√© two Grammys, one in 1983 and another in 1984. Shearing remained fit and active well into his later years and continued to perform, even after being honoured with an Ivor Novello Lifetime Achievement Award in 1993. He never forgot his native country and, in his last years, would split his year between living in New York and Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, where he bought a house with his second wife, singer Ellie Geffert. This gave him the opportunity to tour the UK, giving concerts, often with Torm√©, backed by the BBC Big Band. He was appointed OBE in 1996. In 2007, he was knighted. \\"So\\", he noted later, \\"the poor, blind kid from Battersea became Sir George Shearing. Now that's a fairy tale come true.\\" He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1992 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel. In 2004, he released his memoirs, Lullaby of Birdland, which was accompanied by a double-album \\"musical autobiography\\", Lullabies of Birdland. Shortly afterwards, however, he suffered a fall at his home and retired from regular performing. In 2012 Derek Paravicini and jazz vocalist Frank Holder did a tribute concert to the recordings of Shearing. Ann Odell transcribed the recordings and taught Paravicini the parts, as well as being the MD for the concerts. Lady Shearing also endorsed the show, sending a letter to be read out before the Watermill Jazz Club performance. Personal life Shearing was married to Trixie Bayes from 1941 to 1973. Two years after his divorce he married his second wife, the singer Ellie Geffert. He was a member of the Bohemian Club and often performed at the annual Bohemian Grove Encampments. He composed music for two of the Grove Plays.

It is situated on the Piazza di Santa Croce, about 800 meters south-east of the Duomo. The site, when first chosen, was in marshland outside the city walls. It is the burial place of some of the most illustrious Italians, such as Michelangelo, Galileo, Machiavelli, the poet Foscolo, the philosopher Gentile and the composer Rossini, thus it is known also as the Temple of the Italian Glories' (). Building The original brick fa√ßade (before the 1860s Gothic Revival embellishments by Niccol√≤ Matas) The Basilica is the largest Franciscan church in the world. Its most notable features are its sixteen chapels, many of them decorated with frescoes by Giotto and his pupils, and its tombs and cenotaphs. Legend says that Santa Croce was founded by St Francis himself. The construction of the current church, to replace an older building, was begun on 12 May 1294, possibly by Arnolfo di Cambio, and paid for by some of the city's wealthiest families. It was consecrated in 1442 by Pope Eugene IV. The building's design reflects the austere approach of the Franciscans. The floorplan is an Egyptian or Tau cross (a symbol of St Francis), 115 metres in length with a nave and two aisles separated by lines of octagonal columns. To the south of the church was a convent, some of whose buildings remain. The Primo Chiostro, the main cloister, houses the Cappella dei Pazzi, built as the chapter house, completed in the 1470s. Filippo Brunelleschi (who had designed and executed the dome of the Duomo) was involved in its design which has remained rigorously simple and unadorned. In 1560, the choir screen was removed as part of changes arising from the Counter-Reformation and the interior rebuilt by Giorgio Vasari. As a result, there was damage to the church's decoration and most of the altars previously located on the screen were lost. At the behest of Cosimo I, Vasari plastered over Giotto's frescoes and placed some new altars. The bell tower was built in 1842, replacing an earlier one damaged by lightning. The neo-Gothic marble fa√ßade dates from 1857-1863. The Jewish architect Niccolo Matas from Ancona, designed the church's fa√ßade, working a prominent Star of David into the composition. Matas had wanted to be buried with his peers but because he was Jewish, he was buried under the threshold and honored with an inscription. In 1866, the complex became public property, as a part of government suppression of most religious houses, following the wars that gained Italian independence and unity. The Museo dell'Opera di Santa Croce is housed mainly in the refectory, also off the cloister. A monument to Florence Nightingale stands in the cloister, in the city in which she was born and after which she was named. Brunelleschi also built the inner cloister, completed in 1453. In 1940, during the safe hiding of various works during World War II, Ugo Procacci noticed the Badia Polyptych being carried out of the church. He reasoned that this had been removed from the Badia Fiorentina during the Napoleonic occupation and accidentally re-installed in Santa Croce. Between 1958 and 1961, Leonetto Tintori removed layers of whitewash and overpaint from Giotto's Peruzzi Chapel scenes to reveal his original work. In 1966, the Arno River flooded much of Florence, including Santa Croce. The water entered the church bringing mud, pollution and heating oil. The damage to buildings and art treasures was severe, taking several decades to repair. Today the former dormitory of the Franciscan friars houses the Scuola del Cuoio (Leather School).http://www.leatherschool.com Visitors can watch as artisans craft purses, wallets, and other leather goods which are sold in the adjacent shop. Renovations The basilica has been undergoing a multi-year restoration program with assistance from Italy‚Äôs civil protection agency. On 20 October 2017, the property was closed to visitors due to falling masonry which caused the death of a tourist from Spain. The basilica was closed temporarily during a survey of the stability of the church. The Italian Ministry of Culture said that \\"there will be an investigation by magistrates to understand how this dramatic fact happened and whether there are responsibilities over maintenance.\\"  Art  The altar and crucifix A gate in the gardens with the letters \\"OPA\\" for ora pro animis (\\"pray for souls\\") Artists whose work is present in the church include: * Benedetto da Maiano (pulpit; doors to Cappella dei Pazzi, with his brother Giuliano) * Antonio Canova (Alfieri's monument) * Cimabue (Crucifixion, badly damaged by the 1966 flood and now in the refectory) * Andrea della Robbia (altarpiece in Cappella Medici) * Luca della Robbia (decoration of Cappella dei Pazzi) * Desiderio da Settignano (Marsuppini's tomb; frieze in Cappella dei Pazzi) * Donatello (relief of the Annunciation on the south wall; crucifix in the lefthand Cappella Bardi; St Louis of Toulouse in the refectory, originally made for the Orsanmichele) * Agnolo Gaddi (frescoes in Castellani Chapel and chancel; stained glass in chancel) * Taddeo Gaddi (frescoes in the Baroncelli Chapel; Crucifixion in the sacristy; Last Supper in the refectory, considered his best work) * Giotto (frescoes in Cappella Peruzzi and righthand Cappella Bardi; possibly Coronation of the Virgin, altarpiece in the Baroncelli Chapel, also attributed to Taddeo Gaddi) * Giovanni da Milano (frescoes in Cappella Rinuccini) with Scenes of the Life of the Virgin and the Magdalen * Maso di Banco (frescoes in Cappella Bardi di Vernio) depicting Scenes from the life of St.Sylvester (1335‚Äì1338). * Henry Moore (statue of a warrior in the Primo Chiostro) * Andrea Orcagna (frescoes largely disappeared during Vasari's remodelling, but some fragments remain in the refectory) * Antonio Rossellino (relief of the Madonna del Latte (1478) in the south aisle) * Bernardo Rossellino (Bruni's tomb) * Santi di Tito (Supper at Emmaus and Resurrection, altarpieces in the north aisle) * Giorgio Vasari (Michelangelo's tomb) with sculpture by Valerio Cioli, Iovanni Bandini, and Battista Lorenzi. Way to Calvary painted by Vasari. * Domenico Veneziano (SS John and Francis in the refectory) Once present in the church's Medici Chapel, but now split between the Florentine Galleries and the Bagatti Valsecchi Museum in Milan, is a polyptych by Lorenzo di Niccol√≤, whilst the Novitiate Altarpiece by Filippo Lippi and a predella by Pesellino was painted for the church's Novitiate Chapel. Giotto's Death of St. Francis (early 1320s) with overpainting removed The Bardi Chapel features Giotto's Death of St. Francis, a work which was restored heavily in the 19th century; these restorations were later removed to study the areas which are definitively Giotto's, leaving portions of the painting missing. Funerary monuments The Basilica became popular with Florentines as a place of worship and patronage and it became customary for greatly honoured Florentines to be buried or commemorated there. Some were in chapels \\"owned\\" by wealthy families such as the Bardi and Peruzzi. As time progressed, space was also granted to notable Italians from elsewhere. For 500 years monuments were erected in the church including those to: * Leon Battista Alberti (15th-century architect and artistic theorist) * Giovan Vincenzo Alberti (Florentine senator and minister to first two Lorraine Grand-Dukes) * Vittorio Alfieri (18th-century poet and dramatist) * Eugenio Barsanti (co-inventor of the internal combustion engine) * Lorenzo Bartolini (19th-century sculptor) * Julie Clary, wife of Joseph Bonaparte, and their daughter Charlotte Napol√©one Bonaparte *Leonardo Da Vinci (commemorative plaque, buried in Ch√¢teau d'Amboise in France) * Leonardo Bruni (15th-century chancellor of the Republic, scholar and historian) * Dante (buried in Ravenna) * Ugo Foscolo (19th-century poet) * Galileo Galilei * Giovanni Gentile (20th-century philosopher) * Lorenzo Ghiberti (artist and bronze-smith) * Giovanni Lami * Niccol√≤ Machiavelli by Innocenzo Spinazzi * Carlo Marsuppini (15th-century chancellor of the Republic of Florence) * Michelangelo Buonarroti * Raffaello Morghen (19th-century engraver) * Giovanni Battista Niccolini poet * Gioachino Rossini by Giuseppe Cassioli * Louise of Stolberg-Gedern (wife of Charles Edward Stuart, 'Bonnie Prince Charlie') * Guglielmo Marconi (buried in his birthplace at Sasso Marconi, near Bologna) * Enrico Fermi (nuclear physicist, memorial only - Fermi is buried in Chicago, Illinois) Cloister Monuments *Giuseppe La Farina *Florence Nightingale Image:Michelangelo Tomb Santa Croce.jpgMichelangelo's tomb File:With Byron in Itlay; a selection of the poems and letters of Lord Byron relating to his life in Italy.

Formerly, there was a fortress located at the town, whose location was mentioned by Carl von Clausewitz.

It was shown in theaters alongside The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter, as well as on the subsequent home media releases for the film. This was Warner Bros.'s first Bugs Bunny theatrical release since 1964's False Hare.Sandler (1998), pp. 21‚Äì22 It was issued to commemorate Bugs' 50th anniversary and is included as a special feature on the DVD for The Looney, Looney, Looney Bugs Bunny Movie. Jeff Bergman voiced the three main characters, thus becoming the first person besides the legendary Mel Blanc, who had died two years previously, to provide Bugs' and Daffy's voices. The short was directed by Darrell Van Citters, who went on to direct the first two \\"Hare Jordan\\" Bugs Bunny/Michael Jordan commercials for Nike. Background In the late 1980s, Warner Bros. Animation started producing new theatrical animated shorts, featuring the Looney Tunes characters. The Duxorcist (1987) and The Night of the Living Duck (1988) were well-received individually. Both were then incorporated to the compilation film Daffy Duck's Quackbusters (1988). They marked a return to prominence for fictional character Daffy Duck. They were followed by Box-Office Bunny, the first theatrical short featuring Bugs Bunny since 1964. According to director Darrell Van Citters, the Warner Bros. studio was uncertain what to do with the film. It was reportedly completed six to nine months before its actual release. Its release was delayed because the studio wanted to release it alongside one of their feature films, but could not decide which could best serve to spotlight it. It was finally released alongside The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter (1991). The underperformance of the feature film at the box office is thought to have negatively affected the fate of the short. Kevin Sandler believes the short set an unfortunate pattern for subsequent releases. Later Looney Tunes shorts were similarly attached to children's films which under-performed, in each case dragging the short film with them to relative obscurity. He offers the examples of Chariots of Fur and Richie Rich (1994), Carrotblanca and The Amazing Panda Adventure (1995), Superior Duck to Carpool (1996), and Pullet Surprise to Cats Don't Dance (1997). Staffers involved in the production of several of these shorts reportedly suspected that the studio already knew that these feature films were \\"hard-to-market\\". From a marketing perspective, the shorts could then be used to attract additional viewers to the cinema. Sandler himself, however, suspected that Warner Bros. was simply not particularly interested in generating publicity for the animated shorts.  Plot  The action takes place in a massive movie theater, called \\"Cineminium\\". It is a 100-screen multiplex, constructed right above Bugs's rabbit hole. When Bugs surfaces within the theater, usher Elmer Fudd attempts to drive him away. Meanwhile, Daffy finds the admission fee of the multiplex to be too high for his tastes. He instead uses his library card to force open a door and sneak inside. The would-be free rider stumbles on the usher, Elmer. To divert attention from his own illegal entry, Daffy drives Elmer to further focus on Bugs. He also joins forces with him against Bugs. Following a chase through the movie theater, Bugs manages to trap his opponents within a projection screen and within the film depicted on it. Said film is apparently part of the slasher film subgenre and the trapped duo are confronted by a \\"hockey-mask wearing, chainsaw-wielding maniac\\", this scares Daffy and Elmer and they try to escape, Bugs ends the cartoon by saying, \\"It takes a miracle to get into pictures and now these two jokers just wanna get out.\\". During the \\"That's all Folks!\\" end title, Daffy and Elmer break through the end title in their attempt to escape the movie, and Bugs pokes out of the hole they made and simply says to the audience \\"And that's all, folks!\\" Cast * Jeff Bergman: Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd Additional cast * Greg Berg: Audience voice * Jim Cummings: Actor in movie * Tress MacNeille: Actress in movie Reception In his review of the film, Charles Solomon praised the film as \\"funny, fast-paced, brightly colored\\" and managing to capture the essence of the Bugs-Elmer-Daffy films by Chuck Jones without directly copying them.

Career Burt became secretary of the Northumberland Miners' Association in 1863, then, in 1874, was returned to parliament for Morpeth, alongside Alexander MacDonald, a fellow miners' leader. Burt stood as a Radical labour candidate with Liberal support and formed part of a small group of Liberal‚ÄìLabour politicians in the House of Commons in the 1880s and 1890s. After the 1892 General Election, William Ewart Gladstone appointed Burt as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, in which capacity he served until 1895. Despite the emergence of the Independent Labour Party and the Labour Representation Committee, Burt remained loyal to his backers in the Liberal Party and refused to join. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1906 and continued to represent Morpeth in Parliament until 1918. From 1910 to 1918 he was Father of the House in the House of Commons. Burt resigned as general secretary of the Northumberland Miners' Association in 1913. Personal life Thomas Burt was born at Murton Row, near Backworth, in the county of Northumberland, on 12 November 1837. His father, Peter Burt, was at this time working as a coal hewer for the Backworth Coal Company. At the age of 10 Burt's working life began as a trapper boy at the Haswell Pit. With only approximately two years schooling and at the age of 17 Burt decided \\"how utterly ignorant I was and when I was seized with an eager desire for knowledge and mental improvement\\". In 1860 Burt married Mary Weatherburn and in the 1881 census they were listed as having three daughters and three sons; Rebecca aged 20, Mary aged 13, Thomas aged 11, Peter aged 8, Jane aged 6 and Wilfred aged 1. Poor health led to Burt's retirement from politics in 1918. During the final three years of his life he was bed- ridden.http://www.spartacus-educational.com/TUburt.htm Burt died on 12 April 1922, aged 84 and was buried in Jesmond Cemetery which was in the neighbourhood of his residence in Newcastle upon Tyne. On 12 April 2014 a re- dedication of the Thomas Burt Memorial took place in Jesmond Cemetery. Politics Thomas Burt c. 1895 Formation of the Northumberland Miners' Mutual Confident Association which became the Northumberland Miners' Association. In 1865 Burt was elected executive secretary of the Northumberland Miner's Mutual Confident Association. Continuing as General Secretary of the association for the next fifty years. Burt was guest speaker at the 2nd Durham Miners' Gala and attended as a guest speaker on a regular basis in subsequent years.http://www.dmm.org.uk/whoswho/b908.htm A march for universal manhood suffrage was held in Newcastle on 12 April 1873,: an estimated 80,000 union members marched through Newcastle to the Town Moor, here speakers included Burt. Burt stood on a Radical reform platform, he believed that the franchise should be extended and this would lead to the election of reform-minded MPs. He called for universal suffrage, which would include women, reapportionment of districts to provide roughly the same number of voters in each constituency, shorter duration of each Parliament and payment of MPs. In 1874 Burt was elected as Member of Parliament for the Borough of Morpeth in Northumberland. He received 3,332 votes whilst his opponent Capt. F. Duncan received 585. Burt gave his maiden speech on 13 May 1874 in support of G.O. Trevelyan's private member's bill to 'equalize franchise requirements by extending the borough franchise to the counties. In his speech which was to last fifteen minutes he declared 'that the unfairness of the present law was evident to the miners of Northumberland. Of workers at the same colliery, miners residing in the borough could cast a ballot, while those living in the county could not. Also, because miners often moved from one colliery to another, they could easily lose the vote previously enjoyed'. Unfortunately on this occasion the bill was defeated. After his election as M.P. Burt was to split his time between London and his duties as representative for the Borough of Morpeth and Newcastle and his union role. He made sure he was in attendance for every important union meeting. In October 1874 the mine owners called for a twenty percent reduction of wages, the union put forward a reduction of eight percent. After arbitration the two sides settled on a wage reduction of fourteen percent. In 1906 Burt was made a Privy Councillor. He lost the formal support of his own Union, in 1909, because he would not join the Labour Party. Legacy On 12 November 1987 on the 150th anniversary of his birth, Dr Eric Wade of the Open University gave the memorial address 'Thomas Burt: His Life and Ideas'. The Stephenson Railway Museum located near Murton Row, where Burt was born, has a steam train which the named 'Thomas Burt' in his honour. The aged miners' homes at Choppington, under construction at the time of Burt's death were named the Burt Memorial Homes. The Northumberland Miners' Association named their Trade Union Offices building Burt Hall. The building - in Northumberland Road, Newcastle upon Tyne and now used by Northumbria University - was opened in 1895 and bears a plaque stating the hall 'was built by the miners' in recognition of valuable service rendered by Thomas Burt M.P. as general secretary for 27 years, and to commemorate his appointment as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade in 1892.'

Participants hold the hump for as long as possible, attempting to bring the bull to a stop. In some cases, participants must ride long enough to remove flags on the bull's horns. is typically practised in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu as a part of Pongal celebrations on Mattu Pongal day, which occurs annually in January. As there were incidents of injury and death associated with the sport, both to the participants and to the animals forced into it, animal rights organizations have called for a ban to the sport, resulting in the court banning it several times over the past years. However, with protest from the people against the ban, a new ordinance was made in 2017 to continue the sport.  Etymology  Ancient Tamil Sangams described the practice as (), literally 'bull embracing'. The modern term () or () is derived from ('coins') and ('package'), which refers to a prize of coins that are tied to the bull's horns and that participants attempt to retrieve. () literally means 'bull chasing'.  History  An inscription on at government museum in Tamil Nadu. has been known to be practiced during the Tamil classical period (400-100 BC). It was common among the Ayar people who lived in the ‚ÄòMullai‚Äô geographical division of the ancient Tamil country. Later, it became a platform for display of bravery, and prize money was introduced for participation encouragement. A seal from the Indus Valley Civilization depicting the practice is preserved in the National Museum, New Delhi. A cave painting in white kaolin discovered near Madurai depicting a lone man trying to control a bull is estimated to be about 1,500 years old.  Variants and rules  Jallikattu at Tamil Nadu in 2019. Some variants include: *: This is the most common category of . The bull is released from a closed space () and the contestants attempt to wrap their arms or hands around the hump of the bull and hold on to it to win the award. Only one person is allowed to attempt at a time. This variant is most common in the districts of Madurai, Theni, Thanjavur, and Salem. *: In this variant the approach is slightly different as the bull is directly released into open ground. The rules are the same as that of vadi majuvira·π≠·π≠u. This is a popular variant in the districts of Sivagangai and Madurai. *: In this variant, the bull is tied with a rope ( means 'circle' in Tamil). There are no other physical restrictions for the bull and hence it can move freely anywhere. The maximum time period given is 30 minutes. A team of seven to nine members can attempt to untie the gift token that is tied on the bull's horn. Bulls enter the competition area through a gate called the . Typically, participants must only hold onto the bull's hump. In some variations, they are disqualified if they hold onto the bull's neck, horns or tail. There may be several goals to the game depending on the region. In some versions, contestants must either hold the bulls hump for 30 seconds or for . If the contestant is thrown by the bull or falls, they lose. Some variations only allow for one contestant. If two people grab the hump, then neither person wins.  Breeding  Bos indicus bulls are bred specifically by people of the village for the event. Bulls that are able to participate successfully in the event are used as studs for breeding. These bulls also fetch higher prices in the markets.  Training and preparation  Bull being prepared for  Preparation  With the introduction of the Regulation of Jallikattu Act, 2009, by the Tamil Nadu legislature, the following activities were done in preparation of the event: # A written permission is obtained from the respective collector, thirty days prior to conduct of event along with notification of the event location. # The arena and the way through which the bulls pass through is double-barricaded, in order to avoid injuries to the spectators and by-standers who may be permitted to remain within the barricades. # The necessary gallery areas are built up along the double barricades. # The necessary permissions are obtained from the collector for the participants and the bulls fifteen days prior. # Final preparation before the event include a complete testing by the authorities of the Animal Husbandry Department, to ensure that performance enhancement drugs, liquor or other irritants are not used on the bulls. Animal welfare concerns Between 2008 and 2014, 43 humans and 4 bulls were killed in the events. In 2017, there were 23 deaths in addition to about 2,500 human injuries and several instances of injury to the bulls. 2020 saw 5 deaths from participation in the event. Animal welfare concerns are related to the handling of the bulls before they are released and also during competitor's attempts to subdue the bull. Practices before the bull is released include prodding the bull with sharp sticks or scythes, extreme bending of the tail which can fracture the vertebrae, and biting of the bull's tail. There are also reports of the bulls being forced to drink alcohol to disorient them, or chilli peppers being rubbed in their eyes to aggravate the bull. During attempts to subdue the bull, they are stabbed by various implements such as knives or sticks, punched, jumped on and dragged to the ground. In variants in which the bull is not enclosed, they may run into traffic or other dangerous places, sometimes resulting in broken bones or death. Protestors claim that is promoted as bull taming, however, others suggest it exploits the bull's natural nervousness as prey animals by deliberately placing them in a terrifying situation in which they are forced to run away from the competitors which they perceive as predators and the practice effectively involves catching a terrified animal. Along with human injuries and fatalities, bulls themselves sometimes sustain injuries or die, which people may interpret as a bad omen for the village. An investigation by the Animal Welfare Board of India concluded that \\"jallikattu is inherently cruel to animals\\". Animal welfare organisations such as the Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) and PETA India have protested against the practice. Ban, protests and authorization Anti-ban protesters at Marina beach, January 2017. The Animal Welfare Board of India filed a case in the Supreme Court of India for an outright ban on because of the cruelty to animals and the threat to public safety involved. On 27 November 2010, the Supreme Court permitted the Government of Tamil Nadu to allow for five months in a year and directed the District Collectors to make sure that the animals that participate in are registered to the Animal Welfare Board and in return the Board would send its representative to monitor the event. The Government of Tamil Nadu ordered that be deposited by the organizers in case of an accident or injury during the event and enacted a rule to allow a team of veterinarians be present at the venue for certifying the bulls for participation in the event and to provide treatment for bulls that get injured. The Ministry of Environment and Forests issued a notification in 2011 that banned the use of bulls as performing animals, thereby banning the event But the practice continued to be held under Tamil Nadu Regulation of Jallikattu Act No 27 of 2009. On 7 May 2014, the Supreme Court of India struck down the State law and banned altogether. The Supreme Court noted that any flouting of the ban should result in penalties for cruelty to animals under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The court also asked the Government of India to amend the law on preventing cruelty to animals to bring bulls within its ambit. The Supreme Court also ruled that cruelty is inherent in these events, as bulls are not anatomically suited for such activities and making them participate is subjecting them to unnecessary pain and suffering, so such events were outlawed. On 8 January 2016, the Ministry of Environment and Forests permitted the continuation of the tradition under certain conditions, effectively ending the ban. However, on 14 January 2016, the Supreme Court of India issued a stay on this order, upholding the ban, after a petition filed by the Animal Welfare Board of India and PETA India, leading to protests all over Tamil Nadu. The Supreme Court refused to review its decision on 26 July 2016. On 16 January 2016, the World Youth Organization (WYO) protested at Chennai against the stay on the order overturning ban on conducting in Tamil Nadu. The WYO also demanded a ban on PETA in India. On 8 January 2017, several hundreds of protesters conducted a rally at Chennai Marina opposing the ban on . The participants walked from the lighthouse to the labour statue bearing posters saying \\"save \\". A few churches openly conducted prayer mass and rally against the Supreme Court ruling. Following the protests at Chennai, many students started rallies in various towns of Tamil Nadu. After hearing the petitions which were led by the Animal Welfare Board of India challenging central government's notification, the Supreme Court of India on 12 January ordered a stay, issued notices to the central government and the Tamil Nadu government and later refused to lift the stay. Numerous events were held across Tamil Nadu in protest of the ban, and hundreds of participants were detained by police in response. The Supreme Court has agreed to delay its verdict on for a week following the centre's request that doing so would avoid unrest. Due to these protests, on 21 January 2017, the governor of Tamil Nadu issued a new ordinance that authorized the continuation of events. On 23 January 2017 the Tamil Nadu legislature passed a bipartisan bill, with the accession of the Prime Minister, exempting jallikattu from the Prevention of Cruelity to Animals Act (1960). The first legal jallikattu under this exemption took place on 1 February in Alanganallur, Madurai district. The legal situation surrounding is as yet not clearly resolved. Some, such as ex Ministry of External Affairs cabinet minister Salman Khurshid, have stated that the matter will only be truly resolved if the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act is amended as local ordinances and state laws cannot trump Indian federal law. According to The Hindu, many other Indian legal experts agreed with Khurshid's view, as federal laws such as the PCA are always more powerful than state laws, and in that respect the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act of 2017 is not much different from the state law overturned in 2009. For its part, PETA India has said that it will \\"study\\" the new ordinance, and has not ruled out a challenge to the new law on the same grounds as it challenged the 2009 law. On Jan 25, the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) started the legal process towards another ban by formally challenging the new law before the Supreme Court, but they withdrew the petition on Jan 26. According to the AWBI's acting chairperson, AWBI does not plan to re-file the petition, but he claimed no knowledge of what other organizations, such as PETA, may do. =Timeline of the legal battle against the performance= * 29 March 2006: While hearing a petition filed by K.

In Mannvasanai, the heroine's father declares that whoever tames the bull is eligible to marry his daughter, but kills the animal and commits suicide after an outsider from a nearby village tames it and lays claim to his daughter as the prize.

Situated in Centretown West, it is bounded by Albert Street to the north, Carling Avenue to the south, the O-Train Trillium Line to the west, and approximately Bronson Avenue to the east, while the neighbourhood's main commercial area is along Preston Street. Little Italy is adjacent to Chinatown, whose business district centres on Somerset Street. History Little Italy was initially settled around 1900 by Italian immigrants. Following a fire at a small Murray Street chapel, the 1913 founding of St. Anthony of Padua Church at the corner of Booth Street and Gladstone Avenue cemented the immigrants' connections with the neighbourhood. Roughly between World War I and World War II, a second wave of Italian immigrants was joined by communities of Ukrainian and Polish immigrants in the area. In recent years with the integration of European immigrants, the neighbourhood has found itself home to Asian immigrants, primarily from China and Vietnam. In the 1960s a large section of the poorer neighbourhood was demolished, and replaced with the High School of Commerce, today the Adult High School in 1967. Since 1975, each June the neighbourhood hosts the Italian Week festival, Ottawa's celebration of Italian culture. In 2018, Ottawa's tallest tower, the Claridge Icon, was built to the south end of the neighborhood at the intersection of Preston and Carling. Nearly a dozen projects are either proposed, approved or under construction, including three buildings that will claim the top three spots on the city's list of tallest buildings. These projects are fueled by a recent service improvement announcement for the O-Train Trillium Line which will result in an eight- minute headway between trains at Carling Station as well as a new community design plan calling for high density near the transit station.

McDowell perfected the modern surgical technique of lithotomy, for removal of stones obstructing the urinary bladder.Lee, R. V., & Eimerl, S. (1967). LIFE Science Library: The Physician. New York, NY: Time, Inc., p. 193. One of his most famous patients was James K. Polk, for whom he removed a urinary stone and repaired a hernia. First ovariotomy On December 13, 1809, McDowell was called to see Jane Todd Crawford in Green County, Kentucky, from Danville. Her physicians thought that Mrs. Crawford was beyond term pregnant. McDowell diagnosed an ovarian tumor. Crawford begged him to keep her from a slow and painful death. He then described her condition and that an operation for cure had never been performed. He said that the best surgeons in the world thought it impossible. Crawford said she understood and wanted to proceed. McDowell told her he would remove the tumor if she would travel to his home in Danville. She agreed and rode the sixty miles on horseback. On Christmas morning, 1809, McDowell began his operation. The surgery was performed without benefit of anesthetic or antisepsis, neither of which was then known to the medical profession. The tumor McDowell removed weighed . He determined that it would be difficult to remove completely, so he tied a ligature around the fallopian tube near the uterus and cut open the tumor. He described the tumor as the ovarium and fimbrious part of the fallopian tube very much enlarged. The whole procedure took 25 minutes. Crawford made an uncomplicated recovery. She returned to her home in Green County 25 days after the operation and lived another 32 years. This was the first successful removal of an ovarian tumor in the world. As a Presbyterian,August Schachner. 1921. Ephraim McDowell, \\"Father of Ovariotomy\\" and Founder of Abdominal Surgery. Ephraim McDowell, \\"Father of Ovariotomy\\" and Founder of Abdominal Surgery, p. 4; 58 McDowell's response to this event was recorded in one of his biographies: > How is it that I have been so peculiarly fortunate with my patients of this > description?, I know not; for, from all the information I can obtain, there > has not one individual survived who has been operated, on elsewhere, for > diseased ovaria. I can only say that the blessing of God has rested on my > efforts.August Schachner. 1921. Ephraim McDowell, \\"Father of Ovariotomy\\" and > Founder of Abdominal Surgery. Ephraim McDowell, \\"Father of Ovariotomy\\" and > Founder of Abdominal Surgery, p. 126 All attempts at abdominal exploration before 1809 had resulted in peritonitis and death. Descriptions of McDowell include phrases like \\"neat and clean\\" or \\"scrupulously clean.\\" He was not only neat, but meticulous. In his report on the operation, he described the removal of blood from the peritoneal cavity and bathing the intestines with warm water. McDowell did not publish a description of his procedure until 1817, after he had performed two more such operations. This was widely criticised in the English surgical literature. There is evidence that he performed at least twelve operations for ovarian pathology. \\"Having never seen so large a substance extracted, nor heard of an attempt, or success attending any operation such as this required, I gave to the unhappy woman information of her dangerous situation. The tumor appeared full in view, but was so large we could not take it away entire. We took out fifteen pounds of a dirty, gelatinous looking substance. After which we cut through the fallopian tube, and extracted the sac, which weighed seven pounds and one half. In five days I visited her, and much to my astonishment found her making up her bed.\\" Commemorative stamp honoring Ephraim McDowell, issued December 30, 1959, the 150th anniversary of successful ovarian operation Ephraim McDowell's National Statuary Hall Collection statue Personal life In 1802, McDowell married Sarah Shelby, daughter of Isaac Shelby, war hero and twice governor of Kentucky. They had two sons and four daughters. McDowell played a prominent role in his community. He was also a founder, original corporator, and member of the primary board of trustees of Centre College in Danville. McDowell became a member of the Philadelphia Medical Society in 1817. McDowell was the great-great-grandfather of General John Campbell Greenway, whose statue was placed in the National Statuary Hall Collection by the state of Arizona in 1930. He was cousin to woman's suffrage leader Madeline McDowell Breckinridge. McDowell was a Presbyterian but became an Episcopalian and founded Trinity Episcopal Church in Danville, Kentucky, having donated the land for its first building.Graves D.

She is best known for her portrayal of Julie Williams on the NBC drama Days of Our Lives, and her intermittent portrayal of Joanna Manning on the CBS daytime drama The Young and the Restless. She began playing the role of Julie Olsen Williams on Days of Our Lives in 1968, and is the only actor to appear on the show for all seven decades (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s) in which it has been on the air. Seaforth Hayes still regularly appears on Days as Julie Olsen Williams. Career Susan Seaforth grew up in Hollywood, where she was active in theater as a teenager. Her mother, Elizabeth Harrower (1918‚Äì2003), was an actress and screenwriter who eventually became a part of the writing teams of The Young and the Restless and Days of Our Lives. Her father, Harry Seabold, lived with his bride for ninety days during World War II, through his basic training near Oklahoma City. He shipped out after his daughter was conceived and remained overseas for thirty-three months; during this time, Harrower returned to her family home in Berkeley. Hayes and Ty Hardin, 1962. Seaforth Hayes had a number of featured roles on prime-time television in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Ms. Seaforth appeared in the TV series Cheyenne in the episode, \\"The Bad Penny\\", portraying a young murderess avenging the hanging of her outlaw father. She appeared as Martha Otis, the wife of Jim Otis (Gil Peterson), a gold prospector who finds an unexpected bonanza in silver in the 1967 episode \\"Solid Foundation\\" of the syndicated television series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Robert Taylor. She guest starred in National Velvet, The Fugitive, Redigo, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., at least two appearances on My Three Sons, plus episodes of Emergency!, Adam-12, the 1967-1970 version of Dragnet, and Matlock, starring Andy Griffith. She was in two separate episodes of Cheyenne with Clint Walker in 1962. She had a guest appearance on Perry Mason in 1962 as title character Helen Gregory in \\"The Case of the Stand-in Sister.\\" In the mid 1960s, she appeared on General Hospital as the flirtatious Dorothy Bradley (1964) and later on The Young Marrieds as Carol West (1965), giving her some experience into the hectic world of daytime television soap opera. She is best known for her work on the daytime soap opera Days of Our Lives in the role of Julie Olson Williams, which she played continuously from 1968 to 1984 and again from 1990 to 1993, with recurring appearances in 1994 and 1996. Since 1999, she has appeared on the show in a recurring capacity, often doing double duty between \\"Days\\" and \\"Y&R;\\", in one case appearing on both shows on the very same day, a feat possible because of their different shooting and airing schedules. As of March 2010, she is the only actor to appear on Days of Our Lives in all six decades that it has been in production. In between appearances, she starred from November 1984 to May 1989 as Joanna Manning, mother to Tracey E. Bregman's character, Lauren Fenmore, on The Young and the Restless and as District Attorney Patricia Steele on Sunset Beach in that show's final months on the air. The role of Stephanie Forrester on The Bold and the Beautiful was created for her by former Days headwriter William J. Bell. When she turned it down, her former Days costar Susan Flannery took the role. However, when the character of Lauren Fenmore crossed over, Susan did reprise her role of Joanna Manning on that show for one episode in 2003, and has made several return appearances as that character on \\"Y&R;\\" as Lauren's storyline required the character to be there. Most recently, Susan made a cameo appearance in a music video for Chip Chocolate's \\"Cookie Dance\\" as Mrs. Fields. For her work on Days, Seaforth Hayes has received four Daytime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, in 1975, 1976, 1978, and 1979; and two nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, in 2018, and 2020.https://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/daytime-emmy-nominees- announced-2/ On April 29, 2018, the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences presented Bill Hayes and Susan Seaforth Hayes with Lifetime Achievement Awards at the 45th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards.

The palace was designed by architect Aleksandar ƒêorƒëeviƒá, in a neo-Palladian manner inspired by the 18th century English houses such as Ditchley Park. Its interior was decorated with English Georgian and 19th century Russian antiques by the French design firm Maison Jansen, which later decorated the White House during the administration of John F.

Alexander was assassinated during a state visit to Marseille, France, the same year construction on the palace began. Supervision of construction was overtaken by the Prince Regent Paul until its completion in 1937.

It was later ported to the Xbox in 2003, Microsoft Windows in 2005, the Wii in 2008 in a compilation with The House of the Dead 2, and PlayStation 3 in 2012 with PlayStation Move support. The game was remade with typing controls as The Typing of the Dead 2 in 2008. The game continues the story of the previous games and introduces new gameplay concepts such as story branching. The game's protagonist is Lisa Rogan, daughter of Thomas Rogan and Sophie Richards. Plot The zombie infestation has spread all over the world, reducing the world into desolation with civilization collapsing. In 2019, 16 years after the events of the fourth game, a paramilitary force led by retired AMS agent Thomas Rogan infiltrates the EFI Research Facility, a research center formerly owned by Dr. Roy Curien located in an unnamed place in Europe or North America, to investigate what led to the world's collapse. During the mission, his entire team is killed, until he and his second-in-command, Captain Dan Taylor are left. When they manage to find their answer in a giant laboratory, Death, a gigantic mutant who serves as the facility's security guard, kills Taylor and injures Rogan. While fighting to stay alive, Rogan is approached by an unidentified figure in a semi-corporate attire who offers help. Contact with him is lost. Two weeks later, on October 31, Rogan's daughter, Lisa, accompanied by his former partner, semi-retired agent \\"G\\", arrives at the facility to rescue him. While navigating through the facility, they fend off against hordes of undead creatures, before they encounter Death, whom they fight twice. Later, they fight a deformed sloth, The Fool, and a mutated tendrilous plant named The Sun. Along the way, Lisa muses to \\"G\\" how she has to live in the shadows of her well-known father and that she is often the subject of his comparison. Throughout the game, flashbacks reveal Curien's motivation in his obsession of studying matters of life and death that resulted in him triggering the Curien Mansion's outbreak back in 1998; he was desperate in searching for a cure to treat his son, Daniel, who is suffering from a terminal illness. His increasingly unethical methods led him to believe he would be able to change the world for a better future by developing the mutation. After more fights, Lisa and \\"G\\" reunite with Rogan. They are met by the same figure who approached Rogan in the prologue, revealed to be Daniel Curien, who laments his father's experiments that destroyed the world. After Rogan reveals on how Daniel tended to him, G gets Rogan to safety, while Daniel and Lisa form an alliance to destroy an electrokinetic entity known as the Wheel of Fate. When they reach the giant laboratory, Daniel reveals that the Wheel of Fate is actually his father's body, which underwent a 19-year resurrection process following his death by The Magician, adding that he hacked the program used in its creation some time prior to Lisa and G's arrival, in order to prevent it from being released and destroying the world, saying that the future belongs to the people who are still alive and fighting. The two fight and manage to defeat the Wheel of Fate, which explodes. Endings The game has four endings, each played depending on the player's performance and the final path they took in the game. * The first ending sees Daniel, \\"G\\", Lisa, and Rogan, leaving the facility, with Daniel stating that he will not let his father's efforts go to waste and he will come back to the EFI lab if the humans go down the wrong path again. If a player's rank consists of a B, C, D, or E (less than 3 As or Ss [total]) rank, this ending will be played, and this is considered as the canonical ending of The House of the Dead III. * The second ending is essentially the same as the first, except that Daniel loses the will to go on and reveals that his father's medication has mutated him into a zombie in front of the horrified Lisa. This occurs when a player's rank consists of (3 or more) A or S ranks and defeated Death as the Chapter 4 boss. * The third ending, which is comedic, shows Daniel and Lisa discovering that a zombie had stolen Lisa and G's van, wherein Lisa gives chase with Daniel following her while G and Rogan watch from a distance. This occurs when a player's rank consists of (3 or more) A or S ranks and defeated Sun as the Chapter 4 boss. * The fourth ending depicts a mysterious man in a business suit entering the laboratory where the Wheel of Fate took place and picks one of Curien's vials, muttering that Curien did not understand its true purpose. This occurs when a player's rank consists of (3 or more) A or S ranks and defeated Fool as the Chapter 4 boss. Gameplay Girls playing The House of the Dead III in an amusement arcade in Japan, 2005. The House of the Dead III departs from the original games in many ways: the most obvious being weaponry. The former is immediately apparent upon playing the Xbox version. The shotgun used in the game no longer requires the traditional \\"point off- screen\\" reload, but rather reloads automatically. Reloading still takes time, but happens without prompt as soon as the gun needs it. The arcade version differs here, because there is the presence of light guns, allowing for similar speedy reloading. A reload is achieved by pumping the shotgun controller. While playing the game on Xbox, the light gun controller released by Madcatz may be used; however, the traditional \\"shoot off-screen\\" reload was reintroduced in the Wii version. A branching storyline existed in the previous games, but was handled differently. In The House of the Dead III, the player is given options for navigating through the game prior to the start of most stages, ultimately going through the same areas with different results dependent on the order chosen. Another important difference is the absence of civilians. Unlike the first two The House of the Dead games, in which players could rescue various people in peril, The House of the Dead III contains no extra personnel beyond those central to the plot. Instead, \\"Rescue Events\\" occur during each stage in which the player will need to rescue his or her partner from attacking zombies. An extra life is rewarded for each successful rescue. If all rescue events are successful, the players find crates in the room before the final boss that, when shot, drop a lot of bonuses and lives. A new concept of the series comes in the form of a \\"Cancel\\" bar. In previous installments, the bosses' weak point would only need to be shot once to stun the attack. In this game, the bosses' weak point must be shot repeatedly to drain the \\"Cancel\\" bar and stop the enemy's attack. Another major change to the gameplay comes in the form of a new rank and grade system. Players are now graded on how fast they dispose of the zombies, ranging from Excellent, Good, Faster, and Twin Shot, the last taking place if two zombies are killed with the same shotgun shell. A letter grade is also given at the end of each stage, ranging from S, A, B, C, D and E. Completing the stage with an A rank will award the player with an extra life, while an S rank will reward the player with two. A final grade is given at the end of the game, and depending on how many S ranks were received for each stage, the player may be given a \\"SS\\" rank as his or her final grade. Extra lives and bonus points are also handled differently. In the previous arcade installments, nothing would happen if a player had all five lives and gained another. Now the player can have up to nine lives at a time, and any additional lives are turned into bonus points. In the previous games, bonus points could also be gained by shooting hidden objects such as a golden frog, or coin. The House of the Dead III expands upon this, introducing a silver coin that can be shot repeatedly, a wind-up robot that must be shot several times, and a golden miniature version of the recurring boss The Magician. Decaying zombies and weak points on stunned bosses can also be shot repeatedly for extra points. On the Xbox, PC, PlayStation 3 and Wii versions, there is a \\"Time Attack\\" mode where the player's lives come in the form of a timer, starting at 45 seconds. Excellent, Good, Faster and Twin Shots give extra time, as do clocks in the background, successful rescue events and end-of-stage bonuses. Getting hit by a zombie subtracts 7 seconds, projectiles subtract 5, and bosses subtract 15. Stunning a boss grants the player 10 seconds. Every successful hit on the final boss also grants two seconds, and does not require a stun. The game cannot be continued if the timer reaches zero, and at the end of each game Dr. Curien gives his analysis of the player's performance. The player may also note the average distance at which they managed to hold back the undead in metres. Development The early screens showed the game rendered with the technique of Cel shading which made the game look like a color cartoon, characters even had black outlines. However, the idea was soon abandoned and the final product was rendered similar to the previous games with graphics aiming for realism. The causes of abandonment are unknown, although it is assumed that the idea of a graphic ‚Äúcartoon‚Äù in a game as violent as HOTD III would not satisfy the fans. The Typing of the Dead 2 right The Typing of the Dead 2 is a revision of The House of the Dead III, and the second The Typing of the Dead game. It was developed by Smilebit. It was released in Japan for Microsoft Windows on March 6, 2008. While The House of the Dead III is a light gun shooter, Typing replaces the gun with the keyboard. The game is an educational game, as it requires players to enhance their typing skills to be successful. Reception The game was met with average to mixed reviews upon release. GameRankings gave it a score of 70.72% for the Xbox version, 56.50% for the PC version, and 63.63% for the PlayStation 3 version. Likewise, Metacritic gave it a score of 72 out of 100 for the Xbox version and 64 out of 100 for the PS3 version. The Cincinnati Enquirer gave the Xbox version a score of three-and-a- half stars out of five and praised it for \\"the ability to mow down multiple enemies at once, enhanced graphics, a variety of endings and new creatures.\\" The Digital Fix gave the PS3 version a score of seven out of ten and called it \\"a fun game to blast through, especially in two player mode, and on the PS3 the game is as close to arcade perfection as you are ever likely to get.\\" References External links House of the Dead 3 2002 video games Arcade games Cancelled Dreamcast games Cooperative video games Light gun games Multiplayer and single-player video games PlayStation Move-compatible games PlayStation Network games Post-apocalyptic video games Rail shooters Sega arcade games Smilebit games The House of the Dead Typing video games Video game sequels Video games set in 2019 Video games developed in Japan Video games featuring female protagonists Windows games WOW Entertainment games Xbox games ","title":"The House of the Dead III"},{"id":"704139","text":"Joseph Francis Lally (born December 3, 1963 in Silver Spring, Maryland) is an American bassist, vocalist and record label owner, best known for his work with Fugazi.

Prior to the merger of Waterford County Council with Waterford City Council in 2014, Dungarvan was the county town and administrative centre of County Waterford. Waterford City and County Council retains administrative offices in the town.p. 124: The new local electoral area in the west of the county acknowledges the position and status of Dungarvan, which is currently the 'county' town of Waterford County Council and has a town council. The town's Irish name means \\"Garbhann's fort\\", referring to Saint Garbhann who founded a church there in the seventh century. The town lies on the N25 road (European route E30), which connects Cork, Waterford and Rosslare Europort. Location and access Dungarvan is situated at the mouth of the Colligan River, which divides the town into two parishes - that of Dungarvan to the west, and that of Abbeyside to the east -, these being connected in three places by a causeway and single-span bridge built by the Dukes of Devonshire starting in 1801; by an old railway bridge; and by a ring-road causeway and bridge. History Great Famine. (The Pictorial Times, 1846) Dungarvan Castle Dungarvan Castle, commissioned in the late 12th or early 13th century by King John of England, stands by the harbour. The original structure of the castle, including a shell keep of a type atypical in Ireland, dates to c.1209. The town of Dungarvan was incorporated in the 15th century, was represented by two members in the Irish Parliament until the Act of Union in 1801, and returned one member to the Westminster Parliament until 1885. Unlike nearby Waterford and Duncannon, Dungarvan surrendered without a siege in the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649‚Äì53). The remains of a woolly mammoth were discovered in the town in 1859 by postmaster and amateur antiquarian Edward Brenan. The 1921 Burgery ambush, an incident in the Irish War of Independence, took place near the town. Irish language Approximately 3% of the town's population, or 242 persons are daily Irish speakers, outside of the education system. (Census 2011). Education through the medium of Irish is available at pre-school and primary level in the town in the local Gaelscoil, Scoil Garbh√°n. The Irish Language Officer of Waterford City and County Council is based in Dungarvan. There are a range of activities and projects undertaken to strengthen the Irish language in the town. An Irish in Business award was established in 2009 to recognise businesses in Dungarvan and West Waterford who work to promote the Irish language. GRADAM GN√ì NA nD√âISE Irish in Business Awards 2016 - Waterford City and County Council The town is home to an office of Gl√≥r na nGael, a national body that promotes the Irish language in three areas, the language in the family, in Business and enterprise, and community development. The Dungarvan office is responsible for Gl√≥r na nGael‚Äôs work across South Leinster and most of Munster. There is also contact between the town and the nearby Gaeltacht area of Ring, County Waterford and Old Parish which make up Gaeltacht na nD√©ise. Dungarvan was identified as a potential Gaeltacht Service Town under the Gaeltacht Act 2012. Under the Gaeltacht Act 2012, Gaeltacht Service Towns are defined as those towns situated in or adjacent to Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas and which have a role in providing public services, recreational, social and commercial facilities for those areas. Geography Dungarvan is situated at the mouth of the Colligan River. Dungarvan Harbour as such is formed by The Quay (on the town side) and The Causeway. A single-span bridge was built in the late 18th century by Lord Devonshire to link Dungarvan with Abbeyside and indeed Waterford via said causeway. Outside the harbour, a sandbar, \\"The Cunnigar\\" (Irish An Coinig√©ar) defines the western limit of the wide Dungarvan Bay. The Cunnigar encloses the estuary of the River Brickey which flows out to sea at Abbeyside without actually joining the Colligan. The two estuaries are separated by \\"The Point\\". Religion A friary in Abbeyside, founded by Augustinians in the 13th century, is partially incorporated with the structure of a 20th-century Roman Catholic church. One of the most significant colleges in the town was also founded by these Augustinians whose order survives and maintains an Augustinian church nearer to Main Street. Toponymy In everyday local usage, \\"Dungarvan\\" is taken to refer to the western, more commercial half of the town, where the administrative buildings and shopping areas are situated. Transport Devonshire Bridge Road Dungarvan is positioned on the N25 national primary road and the R672 and R675 regional roads. Maritime Dungarvan harbour The town is separated from the open ocean by a shallow, eastward-facing bay. At its mouth, the bay is about two miles wide, with Dungarvan lying about four miles from the mouth. A meandering navigation channel marked by red/green buoys leads into Dungarvan from the ocean. For most vessels (except small dinghies) this channel is not navigable at low tide. Even at high tide, cruising yachts and larger vessels must be careful to remain in the buoyed channel. There is a well-maintained concrete slipway in Dungarvan town, suitable for launching vessels up to eight metres in length. However, larger vessels should only use it up to three hours either side of high tide. Moorings are usually made available to visiting yachts by Dungarvan Harbour Sailing Club, often free of charge. Bus Dungarvan is served by several bus routes. The Cork to London Eurolines coach, which provides a daily overnight cross channel service, stops at Dungarvan. Bus √âireann Expressway route number 40 runs hourly in each direction providing a link to Cork, Waterford and Rosslare Europort. Bus √âireann's route number 362 also provides a commuter link to Waterford. Several Local Link bus services terminate in the town, including the service to Tallow via Lismore. Dublin Coach serve the town on its M9 Cork to Dublin route via Waterford, passing through every two hours. Rail Until 1967 Dungarvan had a railway station on the now dismantled Mallow to Waterford line and was served by the Rosslare to Cork boat train. A greenway has been developed along the former line to Waterford. Industry One of the few major manufacturing facilities for GlaxoSmithKline consumer products is located in Dungarvan, employing more than 700 people. The town is also the home of Radley Engineering, the company responsible for manufacturing the Spire of Dublin. In days now gone, Dungarvan had a tannery, a distillery, a gasworks, and a fishing fleet. In the later 20th century, a source of trade and employment was Dungarvan Cooperative (Creamery), which connected the town of Dungarvan with its agricultural hinterland. International relations Twin towns ‚Äì Sister cities Dungarvan has been twinned with Erie, Pennsylvania in the US since March 2007. Mercyhurst College, located in Erie, hosts the Global Intelligence Forum held annually in Dungarvan.  Entente Florale  Dungarvan is a 2018 participant representing Ireland's towns in Entente Florale, an international competition organised by the European Association for Flowers and Landscape (AEFP). Literature The British Poet Laureate, Sir John Betjeman (who lived in Ireland from 1941 to 1943) mentions Dungarvan in his poem, \\"The Irish Unionist's Farewell to Greta Hellstrom\\". Each stanza closes with the line, \\"Dungarvan in the rain\\". Dungarvan is referred to in the collection of short stories Labyrinths by Jorge Luis Borges: \\"He was Irish, from Dungarvan. Having said this, he stopped short, as if he had revealed a secret.\\" Poet Mai O'Higgins was born on Saint Mary Street in the town centre.

It is situated where two glens meet, north-west of the Bluestack Mountains, near the confluence of two rivers. Glenties is the largest centre of population in the parish of Iniskeel. Glenties has won the Irish Tidy Towns Competition five times in 1958, 1959, 1960, 1962 and 1995 and has won a medal many other times. , the population is 805. History Evidence of early settlement in the area is given by the many dolmens, standing stones and earthen ringforts dating from the Bronze Age. The area became part of the baronies of Boylagh and Bannagh in 1609, which was granted to Scottish undertakers as part of the Ulster Plantation. Glenties was a regular stopping point on the road between the established towns of Ballybofey and Killybegs, and grew from this in the 17th and 18th centuries. The town was developed as a summer home for the Marquess Conyngham in the 1820s, because of its good hunting and fishing areas. The court house and market house were built in 1843. The Bank of Ireland building was completed in 1880. Famine in Glenties A workhouse was built during the Famine at the site of the current Comprehensive School in 1846, serving the greater Inniskeel area. A 40-bed Fever Hospital was later added to care for the sick and dying. The landlord, the Marquis of Conyngham, decided to halve the population of the town in 1847, faced by the rising costs of the workhouse. Only those who could show title to their land as rent payers were allowed to remain. The rest were given an option of going to America on a ship provided or entering the Workhouse in Glenties. Over 40,000 people died or emigrated from Co. Donegal between the years 1841 and 1851. 20th century The railway was completed in 1895 from Ballybofey. In 1903 a local water scheme was established, to be replaced in 1925 by the current Lough Anna supply. In 1932 electricity was first generated locally in the town. Rural electrification came in the 1950s. Glenties R.I.C. barracks was attacked on numerous occasions during the War of Independence in 1920/1921. On 29 June 1921, a group of Black and Tans were ambushed on their way to Ardara at Kilraine by the insurgents, resulting in the death of a Constable Devine. Two Free State soldiers were killed at Lacklea in 1922 by IRA forces, during the Civil War. In January 1944, a British RAF Sunderland Mark III flying boat crashed in the Croaghs area of the Bluestack Mountains, outside of Glenties, killing seven of its 12-man crew. Brendan Behan spent more than two months with his wife on holiday in Glenties, starting in the third week of May 1960, and staying at the Highlands Hotel, where on Sunday 24 July (while hosting a seven-course dinner), the premises was raided by garda√≠, with the case going to court that September and the hotelier charged with a breach of licensing laws (the raid came more than three hours after closing time). The son of Louis Joseph Walsh defended and Justice Bob O hUadaigh dismissed the case when it was explained that the event had been taking place in a private room where the resident Behan was doing \\"some of his literary work\\". Other events (documented by the Donegal Democrat) included \\"Mr and Mrs Behan, the noted playwright, from Dublin\\" being \\"guest artistes\\" at a meeting of the Ardara and Glenties branch of Comhaltas Ceolt√≥ir√≠ √âireann shortly after taking up residence in Glenties and on Wednesday 8 June Behan was at an ICA dance, picked the winning ticket in a raffle at the interval and sang songs bilingually. Glenties was the first townland in County Donegal to provide cable television to the local area. In 1976 \\"Glenties Community Piped TV Co- op\\" was established which brought cable television to Glenties and the surrounding area, enabling viewers to enjoy multi-channel television from Northern Ireland via BBC One, BBC Two, Ulster Television and from 1982 Channel Four along with the national RTE channels.https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1986-06-17/9/ In April 2006, IRA informer Denis Donaldson was shot dead by the Real IRA at a remote cottage near Derryloaghan, 8 km from Glenties. Bord na M√≥na Bord na M√≥na bought of bog in 1937 to be drained and cut for peat. By 1943 a railway had been extended from Kilraine across the Owenea River to the bogs at Tullyard. Machine cutting commenced in 1946, utilising German-made cutting machines. The company employed 250 men in peak season and peak production was 22,000 tons in 1965. Operations ceased in the late 1990s and the railways and stock were lifted in 2006. Politics Glenties is a Municipal District, which returns six local residents to Donegal County Council. Nationally, Glenties is part of the five-seat Donegal D√°il constituency. Around Glenties Picture taken in Glenties Glenties is situated at the meeting of two glens, and two rivers; the Owenea and Stranaglough. One of its most striking buildings is its unusual church, St Connell's, which was built in 1974 to replace the old church. The building has a flat roof sloping to the ground at a sharp angle. The original bell from the first church is still used today in the newer church. St. Connell is the patron saint of the parish. Liam McCormack won a European Award for its design in 1974. Tourism Patrick MacGill statue A memorial to the 'Navvy Poet', Patrick MacGill, who was born in Glenties, is located on the bridge over the river in the centre of town. St. Connell's Museum St. Connell's Museum St. Connell's Museum and Heritage Center has a good collection of local history artefacts, including some from the famine. The museum is named after St. Connell Caol, who founded a monastic settlement on Inishkeel Island in the 6th century. The museum also has a display about Cardinal Patrick O'Donnell, mementoes from the filming of Dancing at Lughnasa, and an extensive display about the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee. It also has a reading room with a good collection of local historic records.

In 2016, it had a population of 21,393, making it the second largest town in County Kildare after Newbridge. History Naas has been recorded in three forms which are written in Irish: N√°s na R√≠ogh, translating as Place of Assembly of the Kings, An N√°s translating to the Place of Assembly and N√°s Laighean translating to Place of assembly of the Leinster Men. In the Middle Ages, Naas became a walled market town and was occasionally raided by the O'Byrne and O'Toole clans from the nearby area which became County Wicklow. Naas features on the 1598 map by Abraham Ortelius as \\"Nosse\\". A mayor and council were selected by local merchants and landowners. Naas became known as the \\"county town\\" of County Kildare because of its use as a place for trading, public meetings, local administration including law courts, racecourses and the army's Devoy Barracks (closed 1998). Saint David's Castle, a 13th-century Norman castle, was first built c. 1210, although the present structure is a fortified house of the 18th century. One of the first battles of the rebellion of 1798 took place in Naas on 24 May 1798. During the Battle of Naas, a force of about 1,000 rebels were defeated in an unsuccessful attack on the town. In 1898, the Local Government Act established Naas Urban District Council (later called Naas Town Council). Naas Town Council was abolished in June 2014, when the Local Government Reform Act 2014 dissolved town councils and designated Kildare County Council as the administrative authority for the entire county. Amenities St. David's church Canal Harbour, Basin Street Canal from Abbey Bridge South Main Street Naas has a hospital Naas General Hospital, Naas Racecourse, Mondello Park International Motor Racing Circuit, a library, the 200-seat Moat Theatre, five-screen 3D Odeon cinema, RSA driving test centre, tax office, local authority offices, five supermarkets, several pubs, and a number of schools, hotels and nightclubs. Economy Local industrial enterprises include Kerry Group's Global Technology and Innovation Centre, and International Fund Services (a State Street company). The town centre of Naas includes shops, restaurants, nightclubs, boutiques and shops. Other retail outlets have been developed in new retail parks and shopping centres on the outskirts of the town. A shopping centre on Monread Road was completed in 2010 with Ireland's largest Tesco Superstore as the anchor tenant. Other retail parks serve the town on both ends - northern and southern - with outlets such as Harvey Norman, PC World, B&Q;, Smyths Toys, and Halfords. The Naas/Sallins area is served by two Aldi supermarkets, two Lidl stores, two Supervalu supermarkets, a Tesco Extra supermarket, a smaller Tesco Metro in the town centre, and (as of August 2019) a new Dunnes Stores food hall. Danish home retail group JYSK, a competitor for Sweden's IKEA, opened their first Irish store Newhall Retail Park in Naas during April 2019. Several smaller foodstores are scattered around the town. Religion The town has two Roman Catholic churches, one Church of Ireland church, and one Presbyterian church. The original parish church, St David's Church, is Church of Ireland. The Roman Catholic parish church, the Church of Our Lady and St. David, dates from 1827. In 1997, the second Catholic Church opened in Ballycane on the east side of town and is dedicated to the Irish Martyrs. Naas is part of the Diocese of Kildare and Leighlin which is run by Bishop Denis Nulty since August 4, 2013. Media County Kildare's local radio station Kfm 97.3FM ‚Äì 97.6FM is based in Naas.

Transport \\"Perpetual Motion\\", located at the north end of the Naas bypass, created by Rachel Joynt and Remco de Fouw in 1995. The nearby N7 Naas Road connects Naas with Dublin and the M50 motorway (Ireland). Additionally, the M7 Motorway connects Naas with the South and South West. Naas railway station, which opened on 22 June 1855, closed for passenger traffic on 27 January 1947 to be re-purposed for goods trains. It reopened on 10 March 1947, but was closed 12 years later on 1 April 1959. The Sallins and Naas railway station, located in nearby Sallins, is now used by many residents of Naas and the surrounding area for the daily commute to Dublin, with travel times averaging around 30 minutes to Dublin's city centre. The main bus transportation companies serving the area are Bus √âireann, JJ Kavanagh and Sons and Dublin Coach.Bus Eireann , Dublin Coach, Rapid Town Link and web siteSchedule JJ Kavanagh web site Dublin Coach Naas Timetable Website Naas's main bus routes include Bus √âireann's service from Kildare to Dublin city centre (which passes through Naas), a JJ Kavanagh route to Blanchardstown, and Dublin Coach and JJ Kavanagh services to Dublin Airport. The N7 Naas Road was upgraded in 2006 to a six-lane carriageway with grade- separated interchanges.

The River Barrow forms the border. The town was recorded in the 2016 census as having a population of 8,368. History Blackhall Bridge Portarlington was founded in 1666, by Sir Henry Bennet, who had been Home Secretary to Charles II and to whom that King, on his restoration, had made a grant of the extensive estates of √ì D√≠omasaigh, Viscount Clanmalier, confiscated after the Irish Rebellion of 1641. After some difficulties, the grant passed to Sir Henry Bennet of all the √ì D√≠omasaigh lands in the King's and Queen's Counties, and on 14 April 1664 he was created Baron Arlington of Harlington in the County of Middlesex. So great was the anxiety of these new settlers to efface all ancient recollections in Ireland, that the Parliament of Orrery and Ormond enacted that the governor and council should be able to give new English names instead of the Irish names of places; and that after a time such new names should be the only ones known or allowed in the country. In accordance with this enactment the borough created in Cooletoodera (C√∫il an tS√∫daire), received the name of Port-Arlington, or Arlington's Fort.Rev. M Comerford Collections relating to the Dioceses of Kildare and Leighlin Vol 2 (1883). Huguenot settlement 1694 Following the failure of Henry Bennet's English colony, Port Arlington was re-established with the settlement of Huguenot refugees following the Treaty of Limerick: :Unique among the French Protestant colonies established or augmented in Ireland following the Treaty of Limerick (1691), the Portarlington settlement was planted on the ashes of an abortive English colony. Fifteen or more Huguenot families who were driven from France as religious refugees settled on the ashes of Bennet's colony, and the settlement was unique among the Huguenot settlements in Ireland in that the French language survived, being used in church services till the 1820s and continuing to be taught in the town school. :... and till within the last twenty years divine service was performed in the French language.

The relationship to the French influence with Portarlington is celebrated every July with the Festival Fran√ßais de Portarlington. Lea Castle On the outskirts of the parish lies Lea Castle. The remnants of a Norman castle built in 1260 by William de Vesey. It changed hands many times during its history. For example, it was burned by Fionn √ì D√≠omasaigh's men in 1284, rebuilt by de Vesey and given to the king, burned along with its town by the Scots army in 1315, burned by the O'Moores in 1346, captured by the O'Dempseys in 1422 and then lost to the Earl of Ormond in 1452, used by Silken Thomas Fitzgerald as a refuge in 1535, mortgaged to Sir Maurice Fitzgerald in 1556, and leased to Robert Bath in 1618. It was used by the confederates as a mint in the 1640s rebellion until Cromwellians blew up the fortifications by stuffing the stairways with explosives. The castle was never used as a fortification again. Treascon Mass Rock lies just outside the town in an area known as Treascon. This mass rock (Carraig an Aifrinn in Irish) is located within a wooded area, and is a large stone used in mid-seventeenth century Ireland as a location for Catholic worship. Isolated locations were sought to hold religious ceremony, as Catholic mass was a matter of difficulty and danger at the time as a result of both Cromwell's campaign against the Irish, and the Penal Laws of 1695, whereby discrimination and violence against Catholics was legal. The rebellion of 1798 resulted in several local men from Lea castle, being apprehended and subsequently put to death by hanging in the town's market square. A memorial in the shape of a Celtic cross with the rebels details was commissioned and erected in 1976. The memorial stands close to the perimeter wall of the French church in the market square. Rotten borough The Portarlington constituency returned two MPs to the Parliament of Ireland up until the 1801, after which it was reconstituted as a UK Parliament constituency returning 1 MP. Two borough minute books have survived and in the National Library of Ireland Ms 90 for 1727‚Äì1777, and Ms 5095 for 1777‚Äì1841; they reveal the limitation of freemen, and increasing control by the Dawson-Damer family, the Earls of Portarlington.See also John S. Powell, The Portarlington maces and its borough history 1669‚Äì1841 2011 Imperial political democratic practices were responsible for turning Portarlington into a perfectly rotten borough. The reason was to preserve the planters positions politically and economically. Below is an extract that shows that a corporation of 15 people was solely responsible for the persistent re-election of perfect strangers to parliament to represent the other 2800 people. :Prior to the legislative Union between Great Britain and Ireland, this borough sent two Members to the Irish Parliament; since 1800 it has returned one to the Imperial Parliament, and so close has been this corporation, that for 50 years previous to the last general election, the nominee of the Dawson family, commonly a total stranger to the borough, was always returned without a contest. According to the Parliamentary Returns of May 1829 and June 1830, the number of electors, resident and non-resident, was 15; that is, all the members of the corporation.Inquiry held 21, 23, and 24 September 1833, before John Colhoun and Henry Baldwin Geography The Spire is a folly on nearby Corrig/Carrick hill Portarlington is split by the River Barrow. With County Offaly on the north bank and County Laois on the south Bank. The town is mostly flat, with some slight street undulations. The town was partially built on the river's flood plain. More recent drainage improvements has resulted in fewer floodings to areas close to the town. Crossing the river into County Offaly, the land becomes marshy and wet with extensive peat bogs. These peat bogs are broken by some glacial hills, one such hill is called Derryvilla Hill. These hills have been used for gravel and sand production. The southern end of the town is dominated visually by another glacial hill, know locally as Corrig (or Carrick) hill. This hill is topped by a stone structure or spire. This spire was built the latter half of the 19th century. Next to the spire is the town's water supply reservoir. The reservoir uses the gravity afforded by the hill to supply water to the town below. The land on the south side of town is well drained and rises slowly towards the hill of Corrig. This land is agriculturally productive and market farming is practiced here. Demographics From 1841 to 1881, the population of Laois, which was then called the Queen's County, halved from mass emigration and starvation, in spite of the fact that the county (and most other counties) increased food production throughout the period. The county suffered badly during the Great Famine (1845‚Äì47); the county's population dropped from over 153,000 in 1841 to just over 73,000 in 1881. Famine graveyards are known locally. The population of Portarlington doubled between the 2002 and 2016 census (from 4,001 to 8,368 people). According to the 2016 census, 83% of inhabitants were born in Ireland, with Poland (4.9%), the UK (4.5%), and elsewhere in the EU (2.4%) representing other places of birth of the population. Reflecting the development of new housing in the early 21st century, the 2016 census suggested that a majority of residents (56% or 4,677 people) were living in private homes built between 2001 and 2010. Transport Portarlington Railway station Portarlington is a focal point of the Irish railway network, being situated on the junction for services to the west (Galway, Mayo), the south (Cork, Limerick, Tralee) and the east (Dublin, Kildare). Portarlington halt opened on 26 June 1847. Due to the rail service there is a very limited public transport by road. As of January 2017 only one intercity bus service operates direct to Dublin. Now operated by JJ Kavanagh and Sons, (replacing \\"Silver Dawn\\" who had run it for approximately 20 years) this service serves UCD once a day up and return. There is a local-link town service operated by Slieve Bloom Coaches linking Portarlington with Portlaoise and also with Tullamore. An additional private operator, Dublin Coach (known locally as 'the green bus' due its livery) operates an hourly service to Kildare Village Outlet via Monasterevin. From Monasterevin there is an hourly, 24 hour, service to Dublin Airport via Kildare Town, Newbridge, Naas and Red Cow Luas Station. Services from Kildare Village Outlet are available half-hourly direct to the Red Cow Luas Station and Dublin city centre. A weekday service by JJ Kavanagh and Sons via Portarlington en route to NUI Maynooth University and Institute of Technology, Carlow. This service operates during college term only. Education  Col√°iste √çosag√°in is the main secondary school in Portarlington. The school, which is located on the Offaly side of the border, has numerous ongoing programmes including Transition Year, Leaving Cert Applied and Leaving Cert Vocational Programme. There are three Primary Schools, all located on the Laois side of the border. There is also a third level education college providing various courses suitable for post-secondary pupils as well as adult education courses en route to university. Dirty Old Towns RT√â TV Project In 2012, RT√â chose Portarlington as a focal point for the TV show Dirty Old Towns which was filmed over a number of weeks during which local people changed what was becoming an eyesore into a more colourful town. Presented by Dermot Gavin, the show ran for 6 weeks. One of the additions to the town was along the banks of the River Barrow where large red- painted letters spelling \\"L I F E\\" were erected. The original spelling was \\"L I V E\\", however when travelling from the Offaly side of the town it looked like the word \\"E V I L\\". Other additions to the town included two all weather soccer pitches which were Football Association of Ireland sanctioned for soccer schools. The People's Park has been re-developed with new attractions for the children of the town. Old shops have been redecorated and closed premises repainted. The old French School on the banks of the river had been neglected for many years and with help from Dulux paints and the local Lions Club it had a facelift. Events and culture Culture The People's Museum, situated within the Catholic Club on Main Street in Portarlington is small but holds many different exhibits ranging from local memorabilia to a Bronze Age Celtic dagger. Portarlington, its Savoy cinema (now closed) and the nearby Lea Castle appeared in the 1993 Irish film Into the West. The town is also mentioned in Christy Moore's song Welcome to the Cabaret, featured on his 1994 album 'Live at the Point. Outdoor pursuits of angling and hunting are available. Cuisine in the town is varied with pub grub, Chinese, Indian and several fast food restaurants. Festival Fran√ßais de Portarlington A French festival, Festival Fran√ßais de Portarlington, takes place annually in mid-July. The festival typically runs over a weekend, and includes live music, dance, sport, history, food and a parade. The French influence in Portarlington is celebrated with French street entertainers as well as French musicians playing on the opening day. Sport Sports clubs in the area include the Gaelic Athletic Association clubs of Gracefield GAA (based at Gracefield and founded in 1920) and Portarlington GAA (based at McCann Park and founded 1893). Portarlington RFC is the local rugby union club. It was founded in 1974 and competes in the Leinster League. Association football soccer clubs include Gracefield FC, Arlington AFC, and Portarlington Town FC, each of which competes in the Combined Counties Football League of the Leinster Football Association. Other sporting clubs in the area include Portarlington Kestrels Basketball Club, Portarlington Lawn Tennis Club, Portarlington Taekwondo and Portarlington Golf Club.

The ship was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before she was transferred to the China Station in early 1935 where she remained until mid-1939. Duncan returned to the Mediterranean Fleet just after World War II began in September 1939. She was transferred to the Home Fleet in December 1939, although she was badly damaged in a collision the following month, and required repairs that lasted until July 1940. The ship joined Force H at Gibraltar in October, escorting the larger ships and various convoys until March 1941 when she was transferred to West Africa for convoy escort duties for a few months. Duncan rejoined the 13th Destroyer Flotilla at Gibraltar in July and escorted several convoys to Malta during the rest of the year. After a refit, she briefly returned to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla before joining the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean to participate in Operation Ironclad in May 1942. The ship was recalled home to be converted into an escort destroyer in late 1942. Duncan was assigned to Escort Group B-7 in the North Atlantic after her conversion was complete in May 1943. She escorted a number of convoys before she required a lengthy refit from November to May 1944. She helped to sink two German submarines in October 1943. The ship was assigned to anti-submarine duties in the Western Approaches after her refit was finished in May 1944, and Duncan remained there until April 1945. At that time she was transferred to coastal anti-submarine patrols to counter any last-gasp effort by the Kriegsmarine to interfere with the Allied supply lines to the Continent. Placed in reserve the following month, Duncan was in bad shape and was sold for scrap later that year. The demolition, however, was not completed until 1949. Design and construction Duncan displaced at standard load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum boilers. Duncan carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship's complement was 175 officers and men.Whitley, p. 101 The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mk IX guns in single mounts designated 'A', 'B', 'X' and 'Y' from front to rear. For anti- aircraft (AA) defence, Duncan had a single 12-pounder AA gun between her funnels and two quadruple Mark I mounts for the QF 0.5-inch Vickers Mark III machine guns mounted on the sides of her bridge. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.English, p. 141 In 1936, the 12-pounder was replaced by two QF 2-pounder Mk II AA guns. Sometime after the Dunkirk evacuation, the ship's rear torpedo tube mount was removed and replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun and the quadruple 0.5-inch machine guns were replaced by Oerlikon AA guns.Lenton, pp. 155‚Äì56 Duncan was ordered under the 1930 Naval Estimates on 2 February 1931 from Portsmouth Dockyard. She was laid down on 25 September 1931, launched on 7 July 1932 and finally commissioned into the Navy on 31 March 1933. Built as a flotilla leader, she displaced 25 long tons more than the rest of her class and carried an extra 30 personnel. These personnel formed the staff of the Captain (D) of the flotilla.English, p. 51 Career The ship was initially assigned as the leader of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean and made a brief deployment to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea in September‚ÄìNovember 1933. After refitting at Portsmouth between 3 September and 23 October, Duncan led most of her flotilla to the China Station, arriving at Hong Kong on 3 January 1935. The next few years were spent \\"showing the flag\\" around the Far East, and visiting Japan, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, Thailand and Malaya. The ship was under repairs between 14 December 1936 and 4 January 1937 from damage sustained when testing refuelling at sea techniques. She was in Shanghai during the Japanese invasion of 1937 and evacuated British civilians to Woosung, together with the sloop . On 28 October 1938, Duncan was struck by the Greek steamer Pipina whilst lying at anchor at Foo Chow, China. The ship was repaired and given a refit at Hong Kong between 31 October and 14 January 1939. She was lightly damaged when struck by a high-speed target at Wei Hai Wei, China, in July 1939.English, p. 52 World War II With the outbreak of war, Duncan and her sisters , , and , were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, arriving at Alexandria on 30 September. All the ships were in poor condition, and, after repair, they conducted contraband control duties. In December Duncan, along with her sister , was assigned to escort the battleship back to the UK, and they departed Gibraltar on 6 December. During the morning of 10 December, Barham collided with Duchess off the Mull of Kintyre in heavy fog, sinking the destroyer with the loss of 124 lives. Duncan was assigned to the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet on 12 December.English, pp. 52, 60 She was damaged in a collision with a merchant vessel on 17 January whilst escorting Convoy ON18, causing a twenty-foot hole in her side but fortunately she did not sink and was taken under tow.Whinney 1998, pp. 55‚Äì57 After temporary repairs at Invergordon, she was towed to Grangemouth for repairs that were not completed until 22 July. She carried out post-refit trials and returned to Scapa Flow to rejoin the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla. She transferred to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla based at Gibraltar in October, escorting the aircraft carrier , Barham, the heavy cruiser , and the light cruisers and from the Firth of Clyde to Gibraltar. Joining Force H, she escorted Ark Royal during Operation Coat, the carrier when she flew off Hawker Hurricane fighters to Malta during Operation White and escorted Force F to Malta during Collar during November. During the Battle of Cape Spartivento in late November, Duncan was detailed to escort the convoy away from the Italians.Rohwer, pp. 47, 49‚Äì50 On 1 January 1941, she led four ships of the 13th Destroyer Flotilla as they intercepted a Vichy French convoy near Mellila and seized all four merchant ships of the convoy.Osborne, p. 26 A few days later she took part in Operation Excess, a military convoy taking stores to Piraeus and Alexandria. During Operation Grog in early February, the ship escorted the larger ships of Force H as they bombarded Genoa.Rohwer, p. 58 She then escorted the battlecruiser and the carrier from Gibraltar to West Africa in early March and remained there afterwards. Based at Freetown, the ship escorted convoys through West African waters until July when she was recalled to the Mediterranean to escort the Operation Substance convoy from Gibraltar to Malta in July 1941 Reassigned to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla, Duncan remained at Gibraltar and was part of the close escort for the Operation Halberd convoy in late September.Rohwer, p. 103 In October she was assigned as part of the escort for Convoy HG 75, from Gibraltar to Liverpool,Rohwer, p. 109 because she was scheduled for a refit in the Sheerness Dockyard. It began on 16 November and lasted until 23 January 1942, after which Duncan rejoined the 13th Destroyer Flotilla at Gibraltar.English, p. 53 In late February and March, the ship escorted the carriers and Argus as they flew off fighters for Malta.Rohwer, pp. 149, 153 The following month, Duncan was transferred to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Eastern Fleet to support Operation Ironclad, the invasion of Diego Suarez.Rohwer, p. 161 After four months of operations in the Indian Ocean, the Admiralty decided to convert her to an escort destroyer, and accordingly she returned to the United Kingdom via the Cape of Good Hope as an escort for the battleship . The ship arrived in Greenock on 16 November, but did not begin her conversion at Tilbury until 24 November. This involved the replacement of 'A' gun by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar, the removal of her director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge in exchange for a Type 271 target indication radar, exchanging her two 2-pounder AA guns mounted between her funnels for two Oerlikon 20 mm AA guns, the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her searchlight platform, and the removal of her 12-pounder AA gun.Lenton, p. 156 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased to 98 depth charges.Friedman, p. 237 In March 1943, Duncan carried out sea trials and went to Tobermory to work up. In April she joined Escort Group B-7 as the Senior Officer's ship, with Commander Peter Gretton in command at the height of the Battle of the Atlantic. She escorted Convoy ONS 5 in early May, a major convoy battle which saw the destruction of six U-boats for the loss of thirteen ships, although Duncan was forced to withdraw for lack of fuel before the battle was over. Later that month, she escorted Convoy SC 130, in which three U-boats were destroyed for the loss of no ships.Rohwer, pp. 247, 250‚Äì51 Duncan continued on North Atlantic escort duty until October 1943; on 16 October the ship rescued 15 survivors from which had been sunk earlier by a Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber of the Royal Air Force. Whilst defending Convoy ON 207 on 23 October, Duncan, together with the destroyer and a Liberator of No. 224 Squadron RAF, sank .Rohwer, p. 283 Later the same month, on 29 October, Duncan shared the sinking of with Vidette and the corvette whilst protecting Convoy ON 208. By this time the ship was in poor shape and required an extensive refit; the work last from 12 November to 17 May 1944 at the North Woolwich, London shipyard of Harland and Wolff. After working up, she was assigned to the 14th Escort Group for anti-submarine operations in the Western Approaches. Duncan conducted convoy escort and anti-submarine operations with the group through April 1945 when she was assigned to the Greenock Coastal Escort Pool. The ship was placed in reserve on 13 May, transferred to Barrow on 9 June and approved for immediate disposal on 8 July as she was leaking five tons of water a day. Duncan was turned over to BISCO for scrapping immediately afterwards, but demolition was not completed until 1949.

Frequently trees are assumed to have only one root (i.e. minimal element), as the typical questions investigated in this field are easily reduced to questions about single-rooted trees. Definition A tree is a partially ordered set (poset) (T, <) such that for each t ‚àà T, the set {s ‚àà T : s < t} is well-ordered by the relation <. In particular, each well-ordered set (T, <) is a tree. For each t ‚àà T, the order type of {s ‚àà T : s < t} is called the height of t (denoted ht(t, T)). The height of T itself is the least ordinal greater than the height of each element of T. A root of a tree T is an element of height 0. Frequently trees are assumed to have only one root. Note that trees in set theory are often defined to grow downward making the root the greatest node. Trees with a single root may be viewed as rooted trees in the sense of graph theory in one of two ways: either as a tree (graph theory) or as a trivially perfect graph. In the first case, the graph is the undirected Hasse Diagram of the partially ordered set, and in the second case, the graph is simply the underlying (undirected) graph of the partially ordered set. However, if T is a tree of height > œâ, then the Hasse diagram definition does not work. For example, the partially ordered set \\\\omega + 1 = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{0, 1, 2, \\\\dots, \\\\omega\\\\right\\\\\\\\} does not have a Hasse Diagram, as there is no predecessor to œâ. Hence we require height at most omega in this case. A branch of a tree is a maximal chain in the tree (that is, any two elements of the branch are comparable, and any element of the tree not in the branch is incomparable with at least one element of the branch). The length of a branch is the ordinal that is order isomorphic to the branch. For each ordinal Œ±, the Œ±-th level of T is the set of all elements of T of height Œ±. A tree is a Œ∫-tree, for an ordinal number Œ∫, if and only if it has height Œ∫ and every level has size less than the cardinality of Œ∫. The width of a tree is the supremum of the cardinalities of its levels. Any single-rooted tree of height \\\\leq \\\\omega forms a meet-semilattice, where meet (common ancestor) is given by maximal element of intersection of ancestors, which exists as the set of ancestors is non-empty and finite well-ordered, hence has a maximal element. Without a single root, the intersection of parents can be empty (two elements need not have common ancestors), for example \\\\left\\\\\\\\{a, b\\\\right\\\\\\\\} where the elements are not comparable; while if there are an infinite number of ancestors there need not be a maximal element ‚Äì for example, \\\\left\\\\\\\\{0, 1, 2, \\\\dots, \\\\omega_0, \\\\omega_0'\\\\right\\\\\\\\} where \\\\omega_0, \\\\omega_0' are not comparable. A subtree of a tree (T,<) is a tree (T',<) where T' \\\\subseteq T and T' is downward closed under < , i.e., if s, t \\\\in T and s < t then t \\\\in T' \\\\implies s \\\\in T'. Set-theoretic properties There are some fairly simply stated yet hard problems in infinite tree theory. Examples of this are the Kurepa conjecture and the Suslin conjecture. Both of these problems are known to be independent of Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory. K≈ënig's lemma states that every œâ-tree has an infinite branch. On the other hand, it is a theorem of ZFC that there are uncountable trees with no uncountable branches and no uncountable levels; such trees are known as Aronszajn trees. A Œ∫-Suslin tree is a tree of height Œ∫ which has no chains or antichains of size Œ∫. In particular, if Œ∫ is singular (i.e. not regular) then there exists a Œ∫-Aronszajn tree and a Œ∫-Suslin tree. In fact, for any infinite cardinal Œ∫, every Œ∫-Suslin tree is a Œ∫-Aronszajn tree (the converse does not hold). The Suslin conjecture was originally stated as a question about certain total orderings but it is equivalent to the statement: Every tree of height œâ1 has an antichain of cardinality œâ1 or a branch of length œâ1.

Located in the centre of the county, it is the fourth most populous town in the midlands region with a population of 14,607 in the 2016 census. The town retained Gold Medal status in the National Tidy Town Awards in 2015 and also played host to the World Sheep Dog Trials in 2005 which attracted international interest in the region. The Tullamore Show is held near the town every year. The town's most famous export is Tullamore Dew ‚Äì an Irish whiskey distilled by Tullamore Distillery ‚Äì that can be traced back to 1829. The original distillery was shut down in 1954, with the brand later being resurrected and produced at the Midleton Distillery, in Cork. However, the brand's new owners, William Grant & Sons, invested in a new distillery near Tullamore, bringing whiskey production back to the town in 2014.  History  In ancient Gaelic Ireland, Tullamore was located in what was then known as the landfill territory of Firceall ruled by the O'Molloy clan. Firceall was then part of the ancient Kingdom of Meath. Following the plantation of Offaly in the 16th and 17th centuries, Firceall was divided into the baronies of Ballycowan, Ballyboy and Eglish, with Tullamore located in Ballycowan. Tullamore was part of the first English plantation of Offaly in the 1570s. By the mid-1500s the lands that were originally ruled by the O'Molloy clan were securely \\"planted\\" and in the hands of the Moore family. From this point on a dynasty was established which endured into the late nineteenth century, commencing with the grant of the Tullamore area, comprising some 5000 acres, to Sir John Moore in 1622. At that time the Tullamore estate included a ruined castle, ten cottages and two water mills. Sir Robert Forth, who leased the lands from Thomas Moore (son and heir of Sir John), built a mansion house c.1641 in what is now the Charleville demesne. Charles Moore, Lord Tullamore, grandson of Thomas, eventually regained possession of the estate and when he died in 1674 it went via his sister to Charles William Bury. Charles William was later (1806) created the 1st Earl of Charleville in a second creation of the title. On 10 May 1785, the town was seriously damaged when the crash of a hot air balloon resulted in a fire that burned down as many as 130 homes, giving the town the distinction of being the location of the world's first known aviation disaster.Byrne, Michael. The Tullamore Balloon Fire ‚Äì First Air Disaster in History , Offaly Historical and Archaeological Society website, 9 January 2007 (retrieved 7 July 2011), which in turn cites: * Faulkner's Dublin Journal, 14 May 1785, and * Finn's Leinster Journal. To this day, the town shield depicts a phoenix rising from the ashes. The event is yearly commemorated by the Phoenix festival which celebrates Tullamore's resurrection from the ashes following the accident. The Grand Canal linked Tullamore to Dublin in 1798. During the Napoleonic Wars, a clash between troops of the King's German Legion and a regiment of British Light Infantry who were both stationed in the town, became known as the Battle of Tullamore. Tullamore became county town of County Offaly in 1835, replacing Daingean. Tullamore has a long history of whiskey distilling, with two distilleries known to have operated in the town in the 1780s, though closed some years later. Subsequently, a new distillery was established by Michael Molloy, on the site of one of the old distilleries in 1829. When Molloy died, the distillery first passed to his brother Anthony, before eventually making its way into the hands of his nephew, Bernard Daly. When Daly died, his son, Captain Bernard Daly took ownership of the business. With an estate in Terenure, Captain Daly left the day-to-day running of the business to Daniel E. Williams, the distillery's general manager, under whose careful watch the distillery grew and prospered, and launched Tullamore Dew, the whiskey which bears his initials. Williams brought electricity to Tullamore in 1893. The distillery installed the town's first telephones and introduced motorised transport. Williams ran various commercial businesses throughout the Irish midlands ‚Äì drinks businesses, tea importing, seed and grain retail, and a network of 26 general stores. Following this period, Prohibition in the United States, an economic war with Britain in the 1930s, and World War II all harmed the industry. Tullamore was one of many Irish distilleries affected by a general decline in Irish whiskey sales worldwide. After World War II, Desmond Williams, grandson of Daniel E. Williams, used modern marketing techniques to re-establish Irish whiskey in world markets. In 1947, Desmond Williams also developed Irish Mist, an Irish liqueur made from a blend of whiskey, herbs and honey, using a recipe alleged to have disappeared in the late 17th century and to have been rediscovered in a manuscript 250 years later. Williams also capitalised on the Irish coffee concept, and promoted blended whiskies along with Tullamore Dew.  Culture  Patrick Street, Tullamore The Tullamore Phoenix Festival was an annual celebration of art, culture and heritage first held in August 2000. Festival events included hot air balloons, sky diving, concerts, street entertainment, a fire parade, and fireworks. The Queen of the Land Festival takes place in Tullamore each year on the second weekend in November. Primarily a personality contest, it seeks to find the best examples of a modern Irish woman. It is organised by Offaly Macra Na Feirme. Each year about 25 girls between the age of 17 and 35 compete to be crowned Queen of the Land. The festival provides a host of entertainment throughout the town over the weekend, primarily at night. An annual Tullamore Show takes place on second Sunday of August every year. It has grown considerably over the past number of years and is now the largest one day show in the country. It was cancelled in 2007 and 2008 due to heavy rain, though it ran again in 2009. Agriculture was originally the show's main focus, but this has broadened considerably over the years to adapt to Irelands changing culture, with entertainment, food, crafts, lifestyle including 700 trade stands, food and refreshments, fashion and entertainment and an average of 60,000 visitors annually. Hugh Lynch's Pub on Kilbride Street has been operating as a public house since the early 1800s. In the early 1900s it was bought by the Williams Group, founders of the D.E. Williams Distillery, and run as a public bar and grocery, along with many other outlets in the Irish Midlands, from which they sold their growing whiskey brand \\"Tullamore Dew\\". It has been in the Lynch Family since 1971. The national Fleadh Ceoil was held in Tullamore for the very first time in August 2007. It returned in 2008, and returned for a third time from 21‚Äì23 Aug 2009.The 2009 Fleadh Ceoil The National Ploughing Championships, Europe's largest Outdoor Exhibition and Agriculture Trade Show, was held in Screggan, Tullamore in 2016. The total attendance figures for the 2016 Championship came to a record breaking 283,000. The show was set to return to Screggan in September 2017.  Places of interest  Charleville Castle Tullamore Dew The Tullamore Dew Visitor Centre on the banks of the Grand Canal focuses on the distilling, canal and urban history of the town. Audio visual and self-guided tours are available. Charleville Estate is located on the edge of the town. One of Ireland's most splendid Gothic buildings, Charleville Castle, stands in this parkland setting which contains the King Oak, one of the biggest and oldest oak trees in the country. The castle is said to be haunted and was featured on series 1 of Living TV's Most Haunted. The oak woodland is botanically an important survivor of primeval stock. The park was the location of the annual Tullamore Agricultural Show. However following the cancellation of the show for two consecutive years due to heavy rainfall the event was moved to a new location with improved drainage in the Blue Ball area, south of the town. Tullamore is used as a base for the Slieve Bloom Mountains to the south of the county. Just south of Tullamore are the unique 'Lough Boora' parklands. The boglands are a landscape for a wide range of flora and fauna. The wetlands and wildlife wilderness of Lough Boora now host some of the most innovative land and environmental sculptures in Ireland. The artists, inspired by the rich natural and industrial legacy of the boglands, have created a series of large-scale sculptures that are now part of the environmental sculpture park Sculpture in the Parklands. 10 km west of Tullamore is the village of Rahan. The remains of a what was once a large monastery settlement founded by St.Carthage or Mochuda in the 6th century, can be seen in the village. Within 5 minutes' drive is the Celtic cross of Durrow. In the middle of the 6th century a monastery was founded here by Saint Columba. The monastery is famous for an illuminated manuscript, written here in the 7th century, known as the Book of Durrow. There are four metal sculptures located on the N52 Tullamore bypass funded under the percentage for arts scheme where 1% of the budget is allocated to roadside art. Sculptor Maurice Harron created the figures presenting symbols of learning and sanctity. From the north the 1st figure holds up a chalice, the 2nd a book, the 3rd a crosier and the 4th shows the release of a flock of birds representing souls. The figures are located on esker ridges that the new roadway cuts through. There are also a number of churches in the town, including Tullamore Catholic Church, Tullamore Presbyterian Church and St. Catherine's Church of Ireland church.  Economy  Bridge Centre Shopping Centre, Tullamore As the county town of Offaly many government services are located here such as the headquarters of Offaly County Council, the Midlands Regional Hospital and HSE services. Government departments located in the town include the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Education and Skills. Tullamore has traditionally been an important industrial, retail and services centre for County Offaly. When the Grand Canal opened in the late 18th century, it offered increased connectivity to the town and offered an increased market for goods produced in the area. Tullamore Dew, a brand of Irish Whiskey was first distilled in the town in 1829. Tullamore was connected to the national railway network in 1854 by the Great Southern and Western Railway company, now Iarnr√≥d √âireann. Tullamore is also located near the boglands of the Bog of Allen. This provided employment through the work of Bord na Mona. Agriculture is also important to the local economy. In recent years, more high end employment has been brought to the town with the opening of industrial estates in the town such as at Srah Industrial Estate. Employers here include the following multinationals, Sennheiser, GeneMedix, Covidien, Isotron and Zannini.  Retail  The Bridge Centre, is one of the main shopping areas in the town centre, with shops including Dunnes Stores, Vero Moda, and Holland and Barratt. The Tullamore Retail Park on the Portarlington Road also has a mix of shops including Tesco, Heatons, Petmania, Harry Corry and Woodie's DIY. In September 2016, Boots opened in the town centre. This is the largest outlet outside of Dublin city centre and Cork.  Media  From 1975 until 24 March 2008 Tullamore was the home of RT√â Radio 1's principal medium-wave transmitter, broadcasting the AM version of Radio 1 on 567 kHz, at a power of 500 kW. Before this, the main transmission centre had been sited near Athlone. Tullamore is also home to the headquarters of Midlands 103. It is home to a number of local newspapers including The Tullamore Tribune and The Offaly Independent. Tullamore features in several books by best-selling author Lyn Andrews.  Demographics  The population of Tullamore (and its environs) rose by 28.8% from 1996 to 2006 from 10,029 to 12,927. The current population as of the census in 2011 is 14,361.  Transport & access  Tullamore railway station 1982 Tullamore railway station, first opened on 2 October 1854, is served by trains on the Dublin- Galway and Dublin-Westport/Ballina inter-city routes. In association with the County Westmeath urban centres, Athlone and Mullingar, Tullamore forms part of what is known as the Midlands Gateway. Tullamore lies on the N52 national secondary road. This connects to Birr in the southwest of the county and continues towards Mullingar which is located to the northeast. At Kilbeggan (about 12 km north of Tullamore) the N52 forms an interchange with the M6 motorway which connects Dublin and Galway. The N80 national secondary road connects Tullamore with Killeigh, Mountmellick and Portlaoise, travelling in a southwards direction. A number of Regional roads run through the town such as the R420 connecting Tullamore to Moate, Clara and Portarlington, and the R421 which connects to Kinnitty.  N52 Tullamore Bypass  In 2009, Tullamore was bypassed. This involved re-routing the N52 road away from the centre of town forming an eastern bypass of the town. The bypassN52 Tullamore Bypass Scheme ‚Äì www.nra.ie is single carriageway standard and leaves the previous N52 approximately southwest of Tullamore town, intersecting with the N80 road, crossing over the Grand Canal, before rejoining the original N52 again north of the town. A spur has been constructed from the northern section of the route to the Tullamore Western Relief Road R443 resulting in the creation of an almost-full orbital route around Tullamore. The N80 now terminates at its junction with the N52. The scheme began construction in April 2008, and it was officially opened in late 2009 by the Taoiseach Brian Cowen.  Sport  Tullamore has a variety of sporting organisations and clubs in the town. Gaelic Games, Association Football, Rugby Union and Athletics are common in the town. Gaelic Games are represented by Tullamore GAA, Ballinamere Gaa and Durrow Gaa. Tullamore have been successful in winning three senior football championships and one senior hurling championship in recent times. Between football and hurling championships, Tullamore is the most successful club in the history of Offaly GAA. While Ballinamere recently won the intermediate hurling championship in 2013 which now means they are also playing senior along with Tullamore. While Durrow partake in the senior 'b' football championship. O'Connor Park is the Offaly GAA home stadium for both the Offaly Gaelic Football and Hurling teams. The stadium has a capacity of 20,000 following a major upgrade in 2006. The ground currently consists of a covered stand on one side of the pitch, with terracing on the other three. A stand was built in 1991, but replaced by the current structure in 2006. It seats 7,000 people and also includes a press box and a special section for wheelchair users. Soccer is the most popular sport in the town, which is represented by Tullamore Town F.C.. It was founded in 1941 and currently have teams in the Leinster Senior League, Combined Counties League (2nd team Women's and Youths) and the Midland Schoolboys League.http://www.tullamoretownfc.com/ Tullamore Rugby Club was founded in 1937 and is based in Spollenstown. The Tullamore 1sts team was successful in 2012 as Ulster Bank All Ireland Jnr Cup Champions. Tullamore Harriers caters for athletics in the town, and was founded in 1953. Aura Leisure Centre Tullamore, located on Hophill Road, has a full gym suite and a 25-metre swimming pool. The centre offers a range of sport and fitness programmes, swimming lessons and various other courses and classes. Tullamore Golf Club is situated at Brookfield, ever since 1926, located south of Tullamore town, on the Kinnity Road (R 421) just off the N 52. The 18-hole championship parkland golf course is enjoyed by members and visitors alike. It is rated among the top 25 parkland courses in Ireland in Backspin's 2014 Irish Golf Course Rankings.

He has been on the boards of directors of the National Broadcast Editorial Conference, City of Hope, and the American Cancer Society. He has been on the FCC advisory board and advisory board for the Los Angeles District Attorney. Horowitz has been described as a consumer advocate; he personally shunned the description, noting that he always tried to maintain an objective point of view toward both the consumer and the businesses he profiled. Early life David Horowitz attended Bradley University, where he became a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi, and graduated with high honors in 1959. Horowitz earned a master's degree in journalism from Northwestern University in 1961, then worked at newspapers and TV stations in the Midwest, including KRNT-TV (now KCCI-TV) in Des Moines, Iowa. He was a writer for The Huntley‚ÄìBrinkley Report. He opened the first news bureau for NBC News during the Vietnam War. Horowitz was then offered a chance to develop a consumer- awareness segment for NBC's Los Angeles newscast, but nearly turned it down because they had offered it to six other people before him. Appearances Horowitz made a guest appearance on the Super Mario Bros. Super Show! in 1989. He also appeared as himself on an episode of Silver Spoons, ALF, the Golden Girls, The Munsters Today, and Saved by the Bell. Horowitz was also a regular guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (which also occasionally parodied him as \\"David Howitzer\\"). Hostage situation On August 19, 1987, during KNBC's 4 p.m. newscast, a gun-wielding man named Gary Stollman got into NBC's Burbank Studios as a guest of an employee, and took Horowitz hostage live on the air. With the gun pressed on his side, Horowitz calmly read the gunman's statements on camera but unbeknownst to the gunman, the news feed had been taken off the air. The unidentified man revealed at the end of his statement that the gun was an empty BB gun and set the gun down on the news desk, at which point anchorman John Beard quickly confiscated it. The incident led Horowitz to start a campaign to ban realistic toy guns. Controversies In 1998, Horowitz joined a political campaign to urge voters to defeat a California ballot initiative calling for a 20% cut in electricity rates for private utility customers and ending surcharges on ratepayers to pay for nuclear power plants. Horowitz later admitted he was paid $106,000 by the campaign.

The largest river by volume in Montana, it drains an extensive region of the Rocky Mountains in western Montana and northern Idaho in the watershed of the Columbia River. The river flows northwest through a long valley at the base of the Cabinet Mountains and empties into Lake Pend Oreille in the Idaho Panhandle. The Pend Oreille River in Idaho, Washington, and British Columbia, Canada which drains the lake to the Columbia in Washington, is sometimes included as part of the Clark Fork, giving it a total length of , with a drainage area of . In its upper in Montana near Butte, it is known as Silver Bow Creek. Interstate 90 follows much of the upper course of the river from Butte to northwest of Missoula. The highest point within the river's watershed is Mount Evans at in Deer Lodge County, Montana along the Continental Divide. The Clark Fork is a Class I river for recreational purposes in Montana from Warm Springs Creek to the Idaho border. The Clark Fork should not be confused with the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River, which is located in Montana and Wyoming. Description Clark Fork flowing through downtown Missoula (2003) It rises as Silver Bow Creek in southwestern Montana, less than from the Continental Divide near downtown Butte, from the confluence of Basin and Blacktail creeks. It flows northwest and north through a valley in the mountains, passing east of Anaconda, where it changes its name to the Clark Fork at the confluence with Warm Springs Creek, then northwest to Deer Lodge. Near Deer Lodge it receives the Little Blackfoot River. From Deer Lodge it flows generally northwest across western Montana, passing south of the Garnet Range toward Missoula. Five miles east of Missoula, the river receives the Blackfoot River. Northwest of Missoula, the river continues through a long valley along the northeast flank of the Bitterroot Range, through the Lolo National Forest. It receives the Bitterroot River from the south-southwest approximately west of downtown Missoula. Along the Cabinet Mountains the river receives the Flathead River from the east near Paradise. It receives the Thompson River from the north near Thompson Falls in southern Sanders County. At Noxon, Montana, along the Cabinet Mountains and the northern end of the Bitterroots near the Idaho border, the river is impounded by the Noxon Rapids Dam to form a reservoir. It crosses into eastern Bonner County in north Idaho between the towns of Heron, Montana and the town of Cabinet, Idaho. Approximately west of the Idaho‚ÄìMontana border, the river enters the north eastern end of Lake Pend Oreille, near the town of Clark Fork. History The mouth of the Clark Fork on Lake Pend Oreille in Idaho During the last ice age, from approximately 20,000 years ago, the Clark Fork Valley lay along the southern edge of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet covering western North America. The encroachment of the ice sheet formed an ice dam on the river, creating Glacial Lake Missoula which stretched through the Clark Fork Valley across central Montana. The periodic rupturing and rebuilding of the ice dam released the Missoula Floods, a series of catastrophic floods down the Clark Fork and Pend Oreille into the Columbia which sculpted many of the geographic features of eastern Washington and the Willamette Valley of Oregon. In the 19th century the Clark Fork Valley was inhabited by the Flathead tribe of Native Americans. It was explored by Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis and Clark Expedition during the 1806 return trip from the Pacific. The river is named for William Clark. A middle segment of the river in Montana was formerly known as the Missoula River. The river was also referred to as the Deer Lodge River by Granville Stuart. In 1809, David Thompson of the North West Company explored the region and founded several fur trading posts, including Kullyspell House at the mouth of the Clark Fork, and Saleesh House on the river near the present-day site of Thompson Falls, Montana. Thompson used the name Saleesh River for the entire Flathead-Clark Fork-Pend Oreille river system. For most of the first half of the 19th century the Clark Fork river and surrounding region was controlled by the British- Canadian North West Company and Hudson's Bay Company. In the mid-19th century the Clark Fork River wound through the valley where cattle had replaced bison. This was when Conrad Kohrs purchased a ranch from Johnny Grant that is now called the Grant-Kohrs Ranch, a National Historic Site and Federal Park. For a history of the river and the people, see Grant-Kohrs family and history of Clark Fork River region. The Clark Fork and the Blackfoot River experienced a record flood in 1908. Since the late 19th century many areas in the watershed of the river have been extensively mined for minerals, resulting in an ongoing stream pollution problem. Most pollution has come from the copper mines in Butte and the smelter in Anaconda. Many of the most polluted areas have been designated as Superfund sites. Nevertheless, the river and its tributaries are among the most popular destinations for fly fishing in the United States. Today, the Clark Fork watershed encompasses the largest Superfund site in America. As a mega-site, it includes three major sites: Butte, Anaconda, and Milltown Dam/Clark Fork River's Milltown Reservoir Superfund Site. Each of these major sites is split up into numerous sub-sites known as Operable Units. Milltown Dam was removed in 2008 at the junction of the Clark Fork and Blackfoot Rivers. Stimson Dam (an old log crib dam) was removed in 2007 just upstream of the Milltown Dam on the Blackfoot River. Stimson Dam was normally under water due to the Milltown Dam. The area that used to be under Milltown Lake has recently become a State Park. Continued remediation and/or restoration of these sites is ongoing.https://clarkfork.org/our-work/what-we- do/restore-the-best/confluence/ Conservation * Citizens, business, industry, tribes, government and environmental groups combined to oversee the Clark Fork-Pend Oreille river system * non-profit land trust serving Sanders County, Montana and Bonner County, Idaho * The coalition was founded in 1985 and is dedicated to protecting and restoring the Clark Fork River basin. *- WEN is a 501(c)(3) organization located in Missoula, Montana.

Serb civilians forced to convert to Catholicism in Mikleu≈°. Catholic clergy involvement with the Usta≈°e covers the role of the Croatian Catholic Church in the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a Nazi puppet state created on the territory of Axis-occupied Yugoslavia in 1941. Background For centuries, Croatia had been a part of the Habsburg Empire. A variety of ethnic groups have long existed in the region, and there has been a strong correlation between ethnic identity and religious affiliation, with Croats being mainly Catholic, and more Western-oriented, while the Serbs are Eastern Orthodox. Following the dissolution of the Habsburg Empire at the close of World War I, the desire of Croatian nationalists for independence was not realised, and the region found itself first in the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and then in the equally Serb-dominated dictatorship of Yugoslavia established by King Alexander in 1929. Internal borders were redrawn dividing historical Croatia into several provinces. Political repression bred extremism, and the \\"Usta≈°a\\" (\\"Insurgence\\") was formed in 1929 by Ante Paveliƒá, with the support of Fascist Italy. In 1934, King Alexander was assassinated by a Bulgarian gunman, a member of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, a radical group seeking independence, allied with the Croatian Usta≈°e group led by Paveliƒá.Moll, Nicolas (2012). \\"Kampf gegen den Terror\\" [Fight against the Terror]. Damals (in German). No. 6. pp. 72‚Äì77. The new Regent Prince, Paul Karadjordjeviƒá, was convinced by the success of Vladko Maƒçek's more moderate Croatian Peasant's Party at 1938 elections to grant further autonomy to Croatia. On 6 April 1941, Nazi Germany invaded Yugoslavia and Greece.Gilbert, Martin. The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy; Collins: London (1986), p. 147 In their military campaign, the Axis forces exploited ethnic divisions in Yugoslavia, and presented themselves as liberators of the Croats. The then-victorious Axis powers set up a puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Dr≈æava Hrvatska, NDH), which included Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the parts of Dalmatia not annexed to Italy. Deputy prime minister Maƒçek refused to collaborate in a puppet government, and Paveliƒá's Usta≈°e was installed in power. In Paveliƒá, Hitler found an ally. Initially there was enthusiasm for Croatian independence, but the state was in fact under occupation by the German and Italian armies, while the Usta≈°a commenced a ruthless persecution of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies, and dissident Croats and Bosnian Muslims. Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac of Zagreb welcomed Croat independence in 1941, but subsequently condemned Croat atrocities against both Serbs and Jews, and involved himself in personally saving Jews. The Paveliƒá government intended to rid Croatia of its Eastern Orthodox Serb minority in three ways: forcible conversion (1/3), deportation (1/3) and murder (1/3). From around 217,00 to 500,000 people (although the exact number is impossible to ascertain and is disputed by different sides) were killed by the Usta≈°a, both in massacres and at concentration camps, most infamously the one at Jasenovac. Most of the victims were Serbs, but Jews, Roma and dissident Croats and Bosnian Muslims were also targeted. Independent State of Croatia Creation and recognition Ante Paveliƒá, the head of the Usta≈°a, was anti-Serb and viewed Catholicism as an integral part of Croat culture. Historian Michael Phayer wrote that for the Usta≈°a, \\"relations with the Vatican were as important as relations with Germany\\" as Vatican recognition was the key to widespread Croat support. The creation of the Independent State of Croatia was welcomed by the hierarchy of the Catholic Church and by many Catholic priests. Archbishop Stepinac supported Croatia's independence from the Serb-dominated Yugoslav state and arranged an audience with Pius XII for Paveliƒá. Author Peter Hebblethwaite wrote that Paveliƒá was anxious to get diplomatic relations and a Vatican blessing for the new \\"Catholic state\\" but that \\"Neither was forthcoming\\". Giovanni Montini (the future Pope Paul VI) advised Paveliƒá that the Holy See could not recognize frontiers changed by force. The Yugoslav royal legation remained at the Vatican. When the King of Italy averred that the Duke of Spoleto was to be \\"King of Croatia\\", Montini advised that the Pope could not hold a private audience with the Duke once any such coronation occurred. Paveliƒá audience Paveliƒá visited Rome on 18 May 1941 to sign a treaty with Mussolini granting Italy control over several Croatian cities and districts on the Dalmatian coast.Cornwell, 1999, p. 252. While in Rome, Pius subsequently relented, allowing a half-hour private audience with Paveliƒá in May 1941.Hebblethwaite, Peter. Paul VI, the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; pp. 153-57, 210-11 In the 1831 papal bull Sollicitudo Ecclesiarum, Pope Gregory XVI had drawn a clear distinction between de facto recognition and de jure, saying that the church would negotiate with de facto governments, but that was not an endorsement of either their legitimacy or policies.Duffy, Eamon. Saints & Sinners: A History of the Popes, Yale University Press, 2014, p. 285 Soon afterwards, Abbot Giuseppe Ramiro Marcone was appointed apostolic legate to Zagreb. The minutes of a meeting, taken by Vatican Under Secretary of State Montini (later Pope Paul VI), noted that no recognition of the new state could come before a peace treaty and that \\"the Holy See must be impartial; it must think of all; there are Catholics on all sides to whom the [Holy See] must be respectful.\\" Phayer wrote that just after becoming dictator of Croatia and \\"after receiving a papal blessing in 1941, Ante Paveliƒá and his Usta≈°a lieutenants unleashed an unspeakable genocide in their new country.\\" Giuseppe Ramiro Marcone The Vatican refused formal recognition but neither did it cut diplomatic relations with the NDH, preferring to work diplomatically to end Usta≈°a terror.S√°nchez, Jos√© M., Pius XII and the Holocaust: Understanding the Controversy, CUA Press, 2002, p. 20 In 1941, Pius XII did not send a nuncio, or diplomatic representative, but an apostolic visitor, Benedictine abbot Dom Giuseppe Ramiro Marcone, as representative to the Croatian Catholic Church, rather than the government. Phayer wrote that this suited Paveliƒá well enough. Marcone reported to Rome on the deteriorating conditions for Croatian Jews, made representations on behalf of the Jews to Croatian officials, and transported Jewish children to safety in neutral Turkey.Papers of Apostolic Visitor Giuseppe Ramiro Marcone , news.va; accessed 27 February 2014. The Vatican used Marcone, together with Archbishop Stepinac of Zagreb, to pressure the Paveliƒá government to cease its facilitation of race murders. When deportation of Croatian Jews began, Stepinac and Marcone protested to Andrija Artukoviƒá. In his study of rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust, Martin Gilbert wrote: \\"In the Croatian capital of Zagreb, as a result of intervention by [Marcone] on behalf of Jewish partners in mixed marriages, a thousand Croat Jews survived the war.\\" The Pope met with Paveliƒá again in 1943. Pius was criticized for his reception of Paveliƒá: an unattributed British Foreign Office memo on the subject described Pius XII as \\"the greatest moral coward of our age.\\"Mark Aarons and John Loftus, Unholy Trinity, pp. 71‚Äì72 For their part, wrote Phayer, the Vatican hoped the Usta≈°a would defeat communism in Croatia and that many of the 200,000 who had left the Catholic Church for the Serbian Orthodox Church since World War I would return to the fold. Clergy involved in Usta≈°e violence Mark Biondich notes that \\"[T]he younger generation of radical Catholics, particularly those of the crusader organisation, supported the Usta≈°a with considerable enthusiasm, while the older generation of Croat Populists [HSS] was more reserved and in some cases overtly hostile.\\" This generational gap between conservative and radical Catholic priests was further reflected by region (urban vs rural), the geographical location of churches and bishoprics, and an individual priest's relative place within the Church hierarchy. More senior clerics generally disassociated themselves from the NDH. They were also divided by religious orders. The Fransciscans, who had resisted for over fifty years Vatican efforts to turn over parishes to secular clergy, were far more prominently associated with the Usta≈°a than were the Salesians. Mass murder occurred through the summer and autumn of 1941. The first Croatian concentration camp was opened at the end of April 1941, and in June a law was passed to establish a network across the country, in order to exterminate ethnic and religious minorities.Evans, Richard J., The Third Reich at War, Penguin Press; New York 2009, pp. 158-59 According to writer Richard Evans, atrocities at the notorious Jasenovac concentration camp were \\"egged on by some Franciscan friars\\". Phayer wrote that it is well known that many Catholic clerics participated directly or indirectly in Usta≈°a campaigns of violence, as is attested in the work of Corrado Zoli (Italian) and Evelyn Waugh (British), both Roman Catholics themselves; Waugh by conversion. The Croatian Franciscans were heavily involved in the Usta≈°e regime. A particularly notorious example was the Franciscan friar Tomislav Filipoviƒá, also known as Miroslav Filipoviƒá-Majstoroviƒá, known as \\"Fra Sotona\\" (\\"Friar Satan\\"), \\"the devil of Jasenovac\\", for running the Jasenovac concentration camp, where most estimates put the number of people killed at approximately 100,000. According to Evans, Filipoviƒá led murder squads at Jasenovac. According to the Jasenovac Memorial Site, \\"Because of his participation in the mass murders in February 1942 the church authorities excommunicated him from the Franciscan order, which was confirmed by the Holy See in July 1942.\\"\\"Miroslav Filipoviƒá- Majstoroviƒá\\", Jasenovac Memorial website; accessed 14 February 2016. He was also required to relinquish the right to his religious name, Tomislav. When he was hanged for war crimes, however, he wore his clerical garb.Kri≈°to, Jure. Katoliƒçka crkva i Nezavisna Dr≈æava Hrvatska 1941‚Äì1945, Zagreb (1998), p. 223 Ivan ≈†ariƒá, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Vrhbosna in Sarajevo, supported the Usta≈°a, in particular the forcible conversion of Orthodox Serbs to Roman Catholicism. His diocesan newspaper wrote: \\"[T]here is a limit to love. The movement of liberation of the world from the Jews is a movement for the renewal of human dignity. Omniscient and omnipotent God stands behind this movement.\\" ≈†ariƒá appropriated Jewish property for his own use, but was never legally charged. Some priests served in the personal bodyguard of Paveliƒá, including Ivan Guberina, a leader of the Croatian Catholic movement, a form of Catholic Action. Another priest, Bo≈æidar Bralo, served as chief of the security police in Sarajevo, who initiated many anti-Semitic actions. To consolidate Usta≈°a party power, much of the party work in Bosnia and Herzegovina was put in the hands of Catholic priests by Jure Francetiƒá, an Usta≈°e Commissioner of this province.Tomasevich, Jozo. War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941-1945: Occupation and Collaboration, p. 490, Stanford University Press (2001); , One priest, Mate Mugos, wrote that clergy should put down the prayer book and take up the revolver. Another cleric, Dionysius Juriƒçev, wrote in the Novi list that to kill children at least seven years of age was not a sin. Phayer argues that \\"establishing the fact of genocide in Croatia prior to the Holocaust carries great historical weight for our study because Catholics were the perpetrators and not, as in Poland, the victims.\\" Sister Gaudencija ≈†plajt (born Fanika ≈†plajt) was a Catholic nun sentenced by the Partisan military court in Zagreb on 29 June 1945 to execution by shooting for aiding, harboring, and hiding a German bandit, the notorious Usta≈°a Tolj, and other Usta≈°e after the liberation of Zagreb.Presuda Vojnog suda Komande grada Zagreba Miroslavu Filipoviƒáu-Majstoroviƒáu i dru≈æini; Sud. broj 290/45; 1945., lipanj 29., Zagreb. Clergy opposed to Usta≈°e violence Paveliƒá told Nazi Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop that while the lower clergy supported the Usta≈°e, the bishops, and particularly Archbishop Stepinac, were opposed to the movement because of \\"Vatican international policy\\". Along with Archbishop Stepinac, bishops Mi≈°iƒá and Ro≈æman objected to the Usta≈°a violence. Hebblethwaite wrote that to oppose the violence of the new Usta≈°e state, the \\"Vatican's policy was to strengthen the hand of [Archbishop Stepinac] in his rejection of forcible conversions and brutalities.\\" Phayer wrote that Stepinac came to be considered as jeudenfreundlich (Jew friendly) by the Nazi-linked Usta≈°e authorities. He suspended a number of priest collaborators in his diocese. Thirty-one priests were arrested following Stepinac's July and October 1943 explicit condemnations of race murders being read from pulpits across Croatia. Historian Martin Gilbert wrote that Stepinac, \\"who in 1941 had welcomed Croat independence, subsequently condemned Croat atrocities against both Serbs and Jews, and himself saved a group of Jews.\\"Gilbert, Martin. The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust, Doubleday (2002), pp. 203, 466; . Aloysius Mi≈°iƒá, Bishop of Mostar, was a prominent resister. Gregorij Ro≈æman, the bishop of Ljubljana in Slovenia, allowed some Jews who had converted to Catholicism and fled from Croatia into his diocese to remain there, with assistance from the Jesuit Pietro Tacchi Venturi in obtaining the permission of the Italian civil authorities. In Italian-occupied Croatia, Nazi envoy Siegfried Kasche advised Berlin that Italian forces were not willing to hand over Jews and had \\"apparently been influenced\\" by Vatican opposition to German anti-Semitism. The intervention of Giuseppe Marcone, Pius XII's Apostolic Visitor to Zagreb, saved a thousand Croatian Jews married to non- Jews. The Apostolic delegate to Turkey, Angelo Roncalli, saved a number of Croatian Jews by assisting their migration to Palestine. Roncalli succeeded Pius XII as Pope, and always said that he had been acting on the orders of Pius XII in his actions to rescue Jews. Yad Vashem has recognised many people from the area of the NDH as Righteous among the Nations for rescuing Jews from the Holocaust, as of 2019 117 from Croatia, 47 from Bosnia and Herzegovina, and 15 from Slovenia. Those include Catholic nuns, Jo≈æica Jurin (Sister Cecilija), Marija Piroviƒá (Sister Karitas), and Sister Amadeja Pavloviƒá, and a priest, Father Dragutin Jesih, who was murdered.Croatian Righteous among the Nations, yadvashem.org; accessed 17 June 2014.

Archbishop Stepinac denounced atrocities against the Serbs. Phayer wrote that in July 1941, Stepinac wrote to Paveliƒá objecting to the condition of deportation of Jews and Serbs and then, realizing that conversion could save Serbs, he instructed clergy to baptise people upon demand without the normal waiting time for instruction. As Paveliƒá's government cracked down on Serbs, along with Jews, gypsies, Communists and anti-fascists, the Catholic clergy took steps to encourage Orthodox Serbs to convert to Roman Catholicism. Church and forced conversions According to Matthew Feldman, \\"[T]he NDH, not the Catholic orders, oversaw forced conversions; it was Usta≈°a ideology behind the influx of racial ‚Äì not religious ‚Äì anti-Semitism in 1941...\\" \\"...[T]his was a secular, not a religious, regime, one that appealed to (and ultimately perverted) centuries- long Croatian traditions of Roman Catholicism to initially legitimate its rule.\\" By 14 July 1941 ‚Äì \\"anticipating its selective conversion policy and eventual goal of genocide\\" ‚Äì the Croatian Ministry of Justice instructed the Croatian episcopate that \\"priests or schoolmasters or, in a word, any of the intelligentsia, including rich Orthodox tradesmen and artisans\\", should not be admitted. Those precluded from the \\"coming program of enforced conversion\\" were deported and killed, although many who converted or tried to do so met the same fate, anyway.Cornwell, 1999, pp. 250-51. Croats appropriated many Serbian Orthodox churches as \\"vacated or requisitioned\\". The Catholic episcopate and HKP, the Croatian branch of Catholic Action, a lay organization, were involved in the coordination and administration of these policies. Paris notes that more than 50% of the Catholic clergy were active supporters of the Usta≈°e regime. Usta≈°e crimes committed against the Serbian population were generally done so under the pretext of expanding Catholicism in the region. For example, the majority of Serbians interned in NDH concentration camps were interned due to the fact that they refused to convert to Catholicism. In many municipalities around the NDH, warning posters declared that any Serb who did not convert to Catholicism would be deported to a concentration camp. Catholic hierarchy Archbishop Stepinac Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac of Zagreb initially welcomed the Independent State of Croatia granted by Nazi Germany, but subsequently condemned the regime. Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac of Zagreb was, at the time of his appointment in 1934 at the age of 39, the youngest Catholic bishop in the world. He initially received very little guidance from the Vatican and was given great leeway in how to deal with the rise of the Usta≈°e. His control over the lower bishops and clergy was not uniform. Historian of the Holocaust Martin Gilbert wrote that, \\"Stepinac, who in 1941 had welcomed Croat independence, subsequently condemned Croat atrocities against both Serbs and Jews, and himself saved a group of Jews in an old age home.\\" Stepinac shared the hope for a Catholic Croatia and viewed the Yugoslav state as \\"the jail of the Croatian nation\\". The Vatican was not as enthusiastic as Stepinac and did not formally recognize the Usta≈°a, instead sending Giuseppe Ramiro Marcone as an apostolic visitor. According to Phayer, Stepinac, who arranged the meeting between Pius XII and Paveliƒá, was satisfied with this step, viewing it as de facto recognition and Marcone as a nuncio in all but name. Stepinac began attempting to publicly distance himself from the Usta≈°a in May 1941. As the Usta≈°e murders \\"increased exponentially\\" in the summer and fall of 1941, Stepinac fell under \\"heavy criticism\\" for the church's collaboration, but he was not yet prepared to break completely with the Usta≈°e. Phayer wrote that Stepinac gave the Usta≈°e the \\"benefit of the doubt ...[and] decided on a limited response.\\" Stepinac called a synod of Croatian bishops in November 1941. The synod appealed to Paveliƒá to treat Jews \\"as humanely as possible, considering that there were German troops in the country.\\" The Vatican replied with praise to Marcone for what the synod had done for \\"citizens of Jewish origin\\", although Israeli historian Menachem Shelah wrote that the synod concerned itself only with converted Jews. Pius XII personally praised the synod for \\"courage and decisiveness\\". Shelach has written that: > A bishops' conference that met in Zagreb in November 1941 was not... > prepared to denounce the forced conversion of Serbs that had taken place in > the summer of 1941, let alone condemn the persecution and murder of Serbs > and Jews. It was not until the middle of 1943 that Stepinac, the Archbishop > of Zagreb, publicly came out against the murder of Croatian Jews (most of > whom had been killed by that time), the Serbs, and other nationalities. In > the early stage, the Croatian massacres were explained as \\"teething troubles > of a new regime\\" in Rome by Msgr Domenico Tardini of the Vatican state > secretariat.‚Äî Excerpt from Encyclopedia of the Holocaust.Encyclopedia of the > Holocaust, vol 1, p. 328. According to scholar Ronald J. Rychlak: > Stepinac, after having received direction from Rome, condemned the brutal > actions of the government. A speech he gave on 24 October 1942 stated in > part: \\"All men and all races are children of God; all without distinction. > Those who are Gypsies, black, European, or Aryan all have the same > rights....

It is not permissible to > persecute Gypsies or Jews because they are thought to be an inferior > race\\".24 October 1942 speech by Archbishop Stepinac Rychlak writes that the \\"Associated Press reported that \\"by 1942 Stepinac had become a harsh critic\\" of the Nazi puppet regime, condemning its \\"genocidal policies, which killed tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies, and Croats.\\" He thereby earned the enmity of the Croatian dictator, Ante Paveliƒá. ... [When] Paveliƒá traveled to Rome, he was greatly angered because he was denied the diplomatic audience he had wanted\\", although he enjoyed at least two \\"devotional\\" audiences with the pontiff, under whom the Vatican granted Paveliƒá \\"de facto recognition\\" as a \\"bastion against communism\\". Phayer wrote that Stepinac came to be known as jeudenfreundlich (Jew friendly) to the Nazis and the Usta≈°e regime. He suspended a number of priest collaborators in his diocese. Stepinac declared publicly in mid-1942 that it was \\"forbidden to exterminate Gypsies and Jews because they are said to belong to an inferior race\\". When Himmler visited Zagreb a year later, indicating the impending roundup of remaining Jews, Stepinac wrote Paveliƒá that if this occurred, he would protest for \\"the Catholic Church is not afraid of any secular power, whatever it may be, when it has to protect basic human values\\". When the deportations began, Stepinac and papal envoy Giuseppe Marcone protested to Andrija Artukoviƒá. According to Phayer, the Vatican ordered Stepinac to save as many Jews as possible during the upcoming roundup. Although Stepinac reportedly personally saved many potential victims, his protests had little effect on Paveliƒá. Role of the Vatican Cornwell considers Catholic involvement important because of \\"the Vatican's knowledge of the atrocities, Pacelli's failure to use his good offices to intervene, and the complicity it represented in the Final Solution being planned in northern Europe.\\"Cornwell, 1999, pg. 249 Pius XII was a long-standing supporter of Croat nationalism; he hosted a national pilgrimage to Rome in November 1939 for the cause of the canonization of Nikola Taveliƒá, and largely \\"confirmed the Ustashe perception of history\\".Cornwell, 1999, pg. 250 In a meeting with Stepinac, Pius XII reiterated the words of Pope Leo X, that the Croats were \\"the outpost of Christianity\\", which implied that Orthodox Serbs were not true Christians. Pius XII foretold to Stepinac, \\"[T]he hope of a better future seems to be smiling on you, a future in which the relations between Church and State in your country will be regulated in harmonious action to the advantage of both.\\" Undersecretary of State Montini (later elected Pope Paul VI) was responsible for \\"day-to-day matters concerning Croatia and Poland\\". He reported to Pius XII on a daily basis, and heard of the Usta≈°a atrocities in 1941. In March 1942, Montini asked the Usta≈°a representative to the Vatican, \\"Is it possible that these atrocities have taken place?\\", and responded that he would view such accusations with \\"considerable reserve\\" once the representative called them \\"lies and propaganda\\". Montini's fellow Undersecretary, Domenico Tardini, told the Usta≈°a representative that the Vatican was willing to indulge the Usta≈°a because: \\"Croatia is a young state. [...] Youngsters often err because of their age. It is therefore not surprising that Croatia also erred.\\" Stepinac was summoned to Rome in April 1942, where he delivered a nine-page document detailing various misdeeds of Paveliƒá. This document described the atrocities as \\"anomalies\\" that were either unknown or unauthorized by Paveliƒá himself; it is omitted from the ADSS. However, by 1942, the Vatican \\"preferred to have Stepinac try to rein the fascists in rather than risk the effect that a papal denunciation would have on the unstable Croatian state.\\" According to Eugene Tisserant, future Dean of the College of Cardinals, \\"we have the list of all clergymen who participated in these atrocities and we shall punish them at the right time to cleanse our conscience of the stain with which they spotted us.\\" Pius XII was well-informed of the involvement of Croatian Roman Catholic clergy with the Usta≈°a, but decided against condemning them or even taking action against the involved clergy, who had \\"joined in the slaughter\\", fearing it would lead to schism in the Croatian church or undermine the formation of a future Croatian state. Phayer contrasts the Vatican's \\"limited and sketchy\\" knowledge of the genocide in Poland with \\"the Croatian case, in which both the nuncio and the head of the church, Bishop Alojzje Stepinac, were in continuous contact with the Holy See while the genocide was being committed.\\" Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione instructed nuncio Marcone that \\"if your eminence can find a suitable occasion, he should recommend in a discreet manner, that would not be interpreted as an official appeal, that moderation be employed with regard to Jews on Croatian territory. Your Eminence should see to it that [...] the impression of loyal cooperation with the civil authorities be always preserved.\\" According to Phayer, the Vatican \\"preferred to bring diplomatic pressure on the Ushtasha [sic] government instead of challenging the fascists publicly on the immorality of genocide.\\" However, according to Professor Rychlak, \\"Between 1941 and 1944, the Vatican sent four official letters and made numerous oral pleas and protests regarding the deportation of Jews from Slovakia.\\" Rychlak quotes a letter from Pius himself, dated 7 April 1943: \\"The Holy See has always entertained the firm hope that the Slovak government, interpreting also the sentiments of its own people, Catholics almost entirely, would never proceed with the forcible removal of persons belonging to the Jewish race. It is therefore with great pain that the Holy See has learned of the continued transfers of such a nature from the territory of the Republic. This pain is aggravated further now that it appears from various reports that the Slovak government intends to proceed with the total removal of the Jewish residents of Slovakia, not even sparing women and children. The Holy See would fail in its Divine Mandate if it did not deplore these measures, which gravely damage man in his natural right, merely for the reason that these people belong to a certain race.\\" Rychlak adds: > The following day, a message went out from the Holy See instructing its > representative in Bulgaria to take steps in support of Jewish residents who > were facing deportation. Shortly thereafter, the secretary of the Jewish > Agency for Palestine met with Archbishop Angelo Roncalli (later Pope John > XXIII) \\"to thank the Holy See for the happy outcome of the steps taken on > behalf of the Israelites in Slovakia ...

Another instruction from the Holy See > to its representatives in Zagreb directing them to work on behalf of the > Jews went out on 6 March 1943. Aftermath Relations with SFR Yugoslavia Following the defeat of Axis forces in Croatia in 1945, the Communist Partisan leader Marshal Josip Broz Tito established the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a Communist state which lasted until 1991.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online - Josip Broz Tito profile; retrieved 7 September 2013. Yugoslavia was the only post-war Eastern European Communist state which had not been conquered by the Red Army. After the war, writer Evelyn Waugh, a Roman Catholic convert, advised the British Foreign Office, and Pope Pius XII that Tito \\"threatens to destroy the Catholic faith in a region where there are now some 5,000,000 Catholics.\\" According to Phayer, \\"even before the end of the war, Tito had begun to settle the score with the Usta≈°a, which meant with the Catholic Church as well, because of the close relations between the two.\\" Some of Tito's Partisans retaliated against the Catholic clergy for their perceived or actual collaboration with the Usta≈°e. By February 1945, at least fourteen priests had been killed; by March 1945, as many as 160 priests; by the end of the year, 270 priests. According to Waugh (who visited Croatia after the war), \\"the task of the partisans was made easier in that the clergy as a whole had undoubtedly compromised the church by tolerating the pro-Axis Ustashis, if not actively collaborating with them.\\" Franciscans, in particular, were singled out for Partisan attacks and fifteen Franciscan monasteries were destroyed. Pius XII sent an American bishop, Joseph Patrick Hurley, as his envoy to Tito (as Hurley carried the title of \\"regent\\", this was a step below official diplomatic recognition). Tito requested to Hurley that Stepinac be recalled to Rome; the pope, however, deferred to Stepinac, who chose to remain. Vatican \\"ratlines\\" Following the end of the war, clandestine networks smuggled fugitive Axis officials out of Europe. The USA codenamed the activity the \\"ratline\\". In Rome, the pro-Nazi Austrian bishop Alois Hudal was linked to the chain, and the Croatian College offered refuge to many fleeing Croatia, guided by Msgr Krunoslav Draganoviƒá. According to Phayer, \\"at the end of the war, the leaders of the Ustasha movement, including its clerical supporters such as Bishop ≈†ariƒá, fled the country, taking gold looted from massacred Jews and Serbs with them to Rome.\\" Intelligence reports differed over the location of Paveliƒá himself. Counter Intelligence Corps agent William Gowen (the son of Franklin Gowen, a US diplomat in the Vatican) was one of those tasked with finding Paveliƒá; although the CIC hoped the relationship would reveal Paveliƒá's location, eventually, Phayer wrote, the opposite occurred and the Vatican convinced the US to back off. By Phayer's account, Pope Pius XII protected Ante Paveliƒá after World War II, gave him \\"refuge in the Vatican properties in Rome\\", and assisted in his flight to South America; Paveliƒá and Pius XII shared the goal of a Catholic state in the Balkans and were unified in their opposition to the rising Communist state under Tito. By Hebblethwaite's account, Paveliƒá was hidden in a Salzburg convent until 1948, then brought to Rome by Draganoviƒá, who \\"was a law unto himself and ran his own show and lodged him in the Collegio Pio Latino Americano disguised as 'Father Gomez'\\" until Per√≥n invited him to Argentina. Phayer wrote that, after arriving in Rome in 1946, Paveliƒá used the Vatican \\"ratline\\" to reach Argentina in 1948, along with other Usta≈°a, Russian, Yugoslav, Italian, and American spies and agents all tried to apprehend Paveliƒá in Rome but the Vatican refused all cooperation and vigorously defended its extraterritorial status. Paveliƒá was never captured or tried for his crimes, escaping to Argentina, where he was eventually shot by a Montenegrin-Yugoslav agent; he later died of his injuries. According to Phayer, \\"the Vatican's motivation for harboring Paveliƒá grew in lockstep with its apprehension about Tito's treatment of the church.\\" Dozens of Croatians, including war criminals, were housed in the Pontifical Croatian College of St Jerome in Rome. By the spring of 1947, the Vatican was putting intense diplomatic pressure on the US and the UK not to extradite Usta≈°a war criminals to Yugoslavia. Special Agent Gowen warned in 1947 that, due to Paveliƒá's record of opposing the Orthodox Church as well as Communism, his \\"contacts are so high and his present position is so compromising to the Vatican, that any extradition of the subject would be a staggering blow to the Roman Catholic Church.\\" Phayer contends that the feared embarrassment of the Church was not due to Paveliƒá's use of the Vatican \\"ratline\\" (which Paveliƒá at this point, still hoping to return, had not yet committed to using), but rather due to the facts the Vatican believed would be revealed in an eventual trial of Paveliƒá, which never occurred. Phayer wrote that Pius XII believed Paveliƒá and other war criminals could not get a fair trial in Yugoslavia. During this period, across Central and Eastern Europe, a number of prominent Catholics were being punished in reprisals, or silenced as potential sources of dissent by the new Communist governments being formed. The priest-collaborator Joseph Tiso, former President of the Nazi puppet state of Slovakia, was hanged as a war criminal. Rome had been advised that Communist Yugoslavia was threatening to destroy Catholicism throughout the country. In this climate, the Church faced the prospect that the risk of handing over the innocent could be \\"greater than the danger that some of the guilty should escape.\\"Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; pp. 566‚Äì68 According to Eugene Tisserant, future Dean of the College of Cardinals, \\"we have the list of all clergymen who participated in these atrocities and we shall punish them at the right time to cleanse our conscience of the stain with which they spotted us.\\" Pius XII was well-informed of the involvement of Croatian Roman Catholic clergy with the Usta≈°a, but decided against condemning them or even taking action against the involved clergy, who had \\"joined in the slaughter,\\" fearing it would lead to schism in the Croatian church or undermine the formation of a future Croatian state. Post-war trials ;Ro≈æman Bishop Gregorij Ro≈æman of Ljubljana was the first bishop tried for \\"collaboration\\" in Yugoslavia, in absentia, by the military court in August 1946. The case was reopened in 2007 by the Slovene Supreme Court and the 1946 verdict was annulled on procedural grounds. The British occupational authorities recommended he \\"be arrested and interned as a Usta≈°a collaborator\\". Phayer views his trial as a \\"warm-up for proceedings against Stepinac.\\" After Ro≈æman was convicted, Stepinac was arrested. Ro≈æman emigrated to the U.S. sometime after the war and found a haven in the United States through the intercession of influential clerics. He died in the U.S., a legal alien but not a U.S. citizen. ;Stepinac The Archbishop of Zagreb, Aloysius Stepinac, was brought to trial by the Yugoslav government on 26 September 1946. Hebblethwaite called it a \\"showtrial for dramatic effect with the verdict decided in advance, it had nothing to do with justice or evidence.\\" Time Magazine reported in October 1946 that: > In a Zagreb sports auditorium, brilliantly lit for photographers and 500 > spectators, the show trial of Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac and twelve > Catholic priests was rolling to a close. Charged by Marshal Tito with > \\"crimes against the people\\", the 48-year-old head of the world's fifth > largest Catholic diocese ... temporarily lost his equanimity. He shook an > angry finger at the court, cried: \\"Not only does the church in Yugoslavia > have no freedom, but in a short while the church will be > annihilated.\\"YUGOSLAVIA: \\"Aid for the Archbishop\\"; Time Magazine; 14 October > 1946. Stepinac was indicted on charges of supporting the Usta≈°e government, encouraging forcible conversions of Orthodox Serbs, and encouraging Usta≈°e resistance in Yugoslavia. He repeatedly refused to defend himself against the charges and was sentenced to sixteen years in prison. Phayer argues that Stepinac could have defended himself from the charge of supporting forced conversions, but not the other two charges. Hebblethwaite wrote that Stepinac's support for Croatian independence had been based on the Atlantic Charter and the principle that all nations have a right to exist. Archbishop Stepinac served 5 years in Lepoglava prison before the sentence was commuted to house arrest. Pope Pius XII elevated Stepinac to the College of Cardinals in 1952. Although Phayer agrees that Stepinac's conviction was the result of a \\"show trial\\", Phayer also states that \\"the charge that he supported the Usta≈°a regime was, of course, true, as everyone knew,\\" and that \\"if Stepinac had responded to the charges against him, his defense would have inevitably unraveled, exposing the Vatican's support of the genocidal Paveliƒá.\\" Stepinac had allowed state papers from the Usta≈°e to be stored in his episcopal residence, papers crucial to the Usta≈°e in retaking control of the country and which contained volumes of incriminating information against Usta≈°e war criminals. Stepinac was transferred back home to the village of Kra≈°iƒá in 1953 and died in his residence seven years later. In 1998, Pope John Paul II beatified him. Usta≈°e gold The Usta≈°e hiding in Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome brought a large amount of looted gold with them; this was later moved to other Vatican extraterritorial property and/or the Vatican Bank. Although this gold would be worth hundreds of thousands of 2008 US dollars, it constituted only a small percentage of the gold looted during World War II, mostly by the Nazis. According to Phayer, \\"top Vatican personnel would have known the whereabouts of the gold.\\" Surviving victims of the Usta≈°e and their next of kin living in California brought a class action lawsuit against the Vatican bank and others in US federal court, Alperin v. Vatican Bank. Specifically, the Vatican bank was charged with laundering and converting \\"the Usta≈°a treasury, making deposits in Europe and North and South American, [and] distributing the funds to exiled Usta≈°a leaders including Paveliƒá\\". A principal piece of evidence against the Vatican is the \\"Bigelow dispatch\\", a 16 October 1946 dispatch from Emerson Bigelow in Rome to Harold Glasser, the director of monetary research for the U.S. Treasury Department. Former OSS agent William Gowen gave a deposition as an expert witness that in 1946 Colonel Ivan Babiƒá transported ten truckloads of gold from Switzerland to the Pontifical College. All the charges were eventually dismissed.

Large numbers of voters are contacted with little effort made to actually collect and analyze voters' response data. Instead, the push poll is a form of telemarketing-based propaganda and rumor mongering, masquerading as an opinion poll. Push polls may rely on innuendo, or information gleaned from opposition research on the political opponent of the interests behind the poll. Push polls are generally viewed as a form of negative campaigning.Pollster.com: So What *Is* A Push Poll? Indeed, the term is commonly (and confusingly) used in a broader sense to refer to legitimate polls that aim to test negative political messages.Feld, K.G. (2000). \\"What are push polls, anyway?\\" Campaign & Elections, 21(4): 62‚Äì63, 70. In: Winning Elections (R. A. Faucheux, editor), pp. 184‚Äì89. New York: M. Evans & Co. . Future usage of the term will determine whether the strict or broad definition becomes the most favored definition. However, in all such polls, the pollster asks leading questions or suggestive questions that \\"push\\" the interviewee towards adopting an unfavourable response towards the political candidate in question. Legislation in Australia's Northern Territory defined push-polling as any activity conducted as part of a telephone call made, or a meeting held, during the election period for an election, that: (a) is, or appears to be, a survey (for example, a telephone opinion call or telemarketing call); and (b) is intended to influence an elector in deciding his or her vote./ Northern Territory Electoral Act, Section 271: Offence relating to push-polling. Push polling has been condemned by the American Association of Political Consultants and the American Association for Public Opinion Research.AAPOR  AAPOR Statement on \\"Push\\" Polls  Origin  Richard Nixon was one of push polling's pioneers. In his very first campaign, a successful 1946 run for the U.S. House against Democratic incumbent Jerry Voorhis, Democratic voters throughout the district reported receiving telephone calls that began: \\"This is a friend of yours, but I can't tell you who I am. Did you know that Jerry Voorhis is a communist?\\" (Voorhis was not) ‚Äì at which point the caller hung up. A citizen later came forward admitting that she worked for Nixon for $9 a day, in a telephone-bank room where the attack calls were made.Sabato, Larry J. (1996). \\"When push comes to poll\\". Washington Monthly, June, vol. 28 (6): 26‚Äì31.  Types and their effects  The mildest forms of push polling are designed merely to remind voters of a particular issue. For instance, a push poll might ask respondents to rank candidates based on their support of an issue in order to get voters thinking about that issue. Many push polls are negative attacks on other candidates. These attacks often contain suggestions not stated as facts. They ask questions such as \\"If you knew that Candidate Smith was being investigated for corruption, would you be more likely to vote for him, or less likely?\\" The question does not state that any investigation has taken place, so it is not a lie, but it puts in the respondent's mind the idea that Candidate Smith may be corrupt. True push polls tend to be very short, with only a handful of questions, to maximise the number of calls that can be made. Any data obtained (if used at all) is secondary in importance to negatively affecting the targeted candidate. Legitimate polls are often used by candidates to test potential messages. They frequently ask about either positive and negative statements about any or all major candidates in an election and always include demographic questions. The main advantage of push polls is that they are an effective way of maligning an opponent (\\"pushing\\" voters towards a predetermined point of view) while avoiding direct responsibility for the distorted or false information suggested (but not directly alleged) in the push poll. They are risky for this same reason: if credible evidence emerges that the polls were directly ordered by a campaign or candidate, it could do serious damage to that campaign. Push polls are also relatively expensive, having a far higher cost per voter than radio or television commercials. Consequently, push polls are most used in elections with fewer voters, such as party primaries, or in close elections where a relatively small change in votes can make the difference between victory or defeat.  Examples   Australia  In March 2011, The Daily Telegraph reported that the Australian Labor Party was referred to the New South Wales Electoral Commission after it was alleged to have used \\"push polling\\" in Newcastle to discredit independent candidate John Stuart Tate. Labor Party officials employed a market research firm to conduct the polling, telling voters that Tate was the Labor mayor of Newcastle, when in fact he was not. It has been suggested that Labor was worried its brand was so damaged in one of its traditional seats that it branded the popular independent as one of its own to discredit him. Labor polling firm Fieldworks Market Research admitted to the Telegraph reporter that the script used when calling voters branded Tate a \\"Labor\\" candidate, but said the script was provided by the Labor Party.Benson, Simon (March 16, 2011). Labor accused of smear candidate's name. http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/labor-accused-of-smear-candidates-name/story- fn6b3v4f-1226022099138 It is not known, at least in public, whether the Electoral Commission responded to this referral.  United States  George W. Bush used push polls in his 1994 bid for Texas Governor against incumbent Ann Richards. Callers asked voters \\"whether they would be more or less likely to vote for Governor Richards if they knew that lesbians dominated on her staff.\\"Test by Fire: the War Presidency of George W. Bush by Robert H. Swansbrough (2008), p. 47. . In the 2000 United States Republican Party primaries, it was alleged that George W. Bush's campaign used push polling against the campaign of Senator John McCain. Voters in South Carolina reportedly were asked \\"Would you be more likely or less likely to vote for John McCain for president if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child?\\" This hypothetical question seemed like a suggestion, although without substance. It was heard by thousands of primary voters.\\"The anatomy of a smear campaign\\". The Boston Globe In the 2008 presidential election, Jewish voters in several states were targeted by various push polls that linked Barack Obama to various anti-Israel positions. For example, various push polls suggested that Obama was a Muslim; Obama's church was anti-American and anti-Israel; Obama often met pro-Palestinian leaders in Chicago (and had met PLO leaders); a Hamas leader had endorsed an Obama victory; and that Obama had called for a summit of Muslim nations excluding Israel if elected president. The Jewish Council for Education & Research, an organization that endorsed Obama, denounced the push polls as disinformation and lies.Smith, Ben (September 15, 2008). Jewish voters complain of anti-Obama poll. http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/Jewish_voters_complain_of_antiObama_poll.html?showall Political consultant Lee Atwater was also well known for using push-polling among his aggressive campaign tactics, though apologised for this in later life. Amid widespread controversy over the Trump administration's executive order restricting immigration from the Middle East, the GOP sent out a poll to supporters on February 17, 2017 titled \\"Mainstream Media Accountability\\" which included such questions as \\"Do you believe that the media unfairly reported on President Trump‚Äôs executive order temporarily restricting people entering our country from nations compromised by radical Islamic terrorism?\\" and \\"Were you aware that a poll was released revealing that a majority of Americans actually supported President Trump's temporary restriction executive order?\\" Similar tactics have been utilized by the Trump campaign through out the 2020 United States presidential election.

The New York Times2010 New Hampshire Statutes: Elections: Political expenditures and contributions. 13 NH 664.13 NH 664 The parliament of the Northern Territory (Australia) has legislated to restrict push polling in that, during an election, the caller is required to identify his/her name and address.

Family Tetisheri was the daughter of Tjenna and Neferu. The names of Tetisheri's parents are known from mummy bandages found in TT320.Dodson, Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, 2004. She was selected by Senakhtenre, despite her non-royal birth, to be not only his wife but his Great Royal Wife. Tetisheri was the mother of Seqenenre Tao, Queen Ahhotep I and possibly Kamose. Pharaoh Ahmose I erected a stela at Abydos to announce the construction of a pyramid and a \\"house\\" for Tetisheri. Ahmose refers to the Queen as \\"the mother of my mother, and the mother of my father, great king's wife and king's-mother, Tetisheri\\" (Breasted).Breasted, 1906. Ancient Records of Egypt, section: v. 2. The eighteen dynasty, p.14-17. James Henry Breasted, 1906, University of Chicago Press. Burial, cenotaph, and pyramid  Tetisheri was likely buried in Thebes and she may have been reinterred in the royal cache in TT320. No tomb at Thebes has yet been conclusively identified with Queen Tetisheri, though a mummy that may be hers was included among other members of the royal family reburied in the Royal Cache (DB320). Pharaoh Ahmose had a memorial structure or cenotaph at Abydos erected in her honour, in the midst of his own extensive mortuary complex at that site. This mudbrick structure was discovered in 1902 by the Egypt Exploration Fund, and was found to contain a monumental stela detailing the dedication by Ahmose I and his sister-wife Ahmose-Nefertari of a pyramid and enclosure (or shrine) to Tetisheri.Porter and Moss, Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Statues, Reliefs and Paintings, Volume V. Upper Egypt: Sites. (1st ed.) 2004, pg 91-92. Statuette of Tetisheri, British Museum, possibly a forgery Its discoverer, C. T. Currelly, believed the textual reference to a \\"pyramid\\" of Tetisheri to refer not to the building in which the stela was found, but rather to the more imposing pyramid associated with a large mortuary temple at its base discovered in 1900 by A. C. Mace. Based on recent discoveries, however, this view can no longer be maintained. The foundations of the structure, originally described by Currelly in 1903 as a \\"shrine\\" or \\"mastaba,\\" was demonstrated in 2004 through the renewed excavations of the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago under the direction of S. Harvey to have actually formed the lowest courses of a brick pyramid, the last queen's pyramid to have been built in Egypt. Portions of the limestone pyramidion or capstone were discovered as well, demonstrating conclusively that this structure was pyramidal in form. Magnetic survey also revealed a brick enclosure some 70 by 90 meters in scale, a feature not detected by earlier archaeologists. These accordingly may now be identified as the features described in Ahmose's stela found within: a pyramid and an enclosure, built in the midst of Ahmose's own mortuary complex. A statuette long in the collections of the British Museum bearing an inscription naming Tetisheri was identified as a forgery by W. V. Davies, based on the slavish imitation of its inscription from a fragmentary lower portion of a similar statue of the queen (now lost). However, some scholars question this attribution, and have been raising questions as to the potential authenticity of the statuette itself, if not the inscription.

It was designed specifically for running games created for Microsoft Windows under Linux. As such, its primary focus was implementing the DirectX API. WineX was renamed to Cedega on the release of version 4.0 on June 22, 2004. Cedega Gaming Service was retired on February 28, 2011. TransGaming announced that development would continue under the GameTree Linux Developer Program, however this proved moot as the company's core technology divisions were shuttered in 2016. Licenses Though Cedega was mainly proprietary software, TransGaming did make part of the source publicly available via CVS, under a mix of licenses. Though this was mainly done to allow a means for the public to view and submit fixes to the code, it was also frequently used as a means to obtain a quasi-demonstration version of Cedega. TransGaming released a proper demo of Cedega because of complaints of the difficulty of building a usable version of the program from the public CVS, as well as its outdated nature. The demo released by Cedega gave users a 14-day trial of a reasonably current version of the product with a watermark of the Cedega logo which faded from almost transparent to fully opaque every few seconds. This demo was removed without comment. While the licenses under which the code was released do permit non-commercial redistribution of precompiled public-CVS versions of the software, TransGaming strongly discouraged this, openly warning that the license would be changed if they felt that abuse was occurring or otherwise threatened. TransGaming similarly discouraged source-based distributions like Gentoo Linux from creating automated tools to let people build their own version of Cedega from the public CVS. The Wine project originally released Wine under the same MIT License as the X Window System, but owing to concern about proprietary versions of Wine not contributing their changes back to the core project, work as of March 2002 has used the LGPL for its licensing. Functionality In some cases it closely mimicked the experience that Windows users have (insert disc, run Setup.exe, play). In other cases some amount of user tweaking is required to get the game installed and in a state of playability. Cedega 5.2 introduced a feature called the Games Disc Database (GDDB) that simplifies many of these settings and adds auto-game detection when a CD is inserted so that settings are applied for the inserted game automatically. A basic list of features: * Some types of copy protection * Pixel Shaders 3.0 * Vertex Shaders 3.0 * DirectX 9.0 * Joystick support including remapping axes * The ability to run some Windows games History Cedega subscribers dwindled as users expressed a number of complaints due to lack of updates, fatal problems with supported games and with Wine having achieved a number of features that were unique to Cedega, giving even better compatibility in some cases. Users attributed the apparent lack of interest from TransGaming on Cedega to their focus on Cider, a similar Wine-based API layer for Mac OS X systems, supported by Electronic Arts to bring their Windows native games to Mac. On November 13, 2007's Development Status report, TransGaming explained that a number of modifications have been made to Cedega‚Äôs code to add Wine's implementation of the MSI installation system and to be able to incorporate more of Wine‚Äôs codebase. It was never confirmed if those changes were in conformance with Wine's LGPL license. Also on the November 13, 2007 report, it was announced that all of the work done on Cider would be merged back into Cedega (since both share the same code). Among the new features are ‚Äúnew copy protection, 2.0 shader updates, a head start on shader model 3.0, performance upgrades, a self updating user interface‚Äù and others. On September 23, 2008, Cedega officially presented the new version 6.1. Cedega Gaming Service was retired on February 28, 2011. Controversy TransGaming‚Äôs business practice of benefiting financially from the Wine project, without contributing anything back to it has drawn criticism. TransGaming obtained the source to the original Wine project when it was under the MIT License and this license placed no requirements on how TransGaming published their software. TransGaming decided to release their software as proprietary software.How to run Windows games on Linux - Maximum PC Cedega includes licensed support for several types of CD-based copy protection (notably SecuROM and SafeDisc), the code for which TransGaming said they were under contract not to disclose. In 2002 the Wine project changed its license to the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). This means that anyone who publishes a modified version of Wine must publish the source code under an LGPL-compatible license. TransGaming halted using code contributed to Wine when the license was changed, though this has resumed with TransGaming integrating certain LGPL portions of Wine into Cedega and placing those portions of the source code on their public servers. TransGaming offers a CVS tree for Cedega without copy protection related code and texture compression through its own repositories with mixed LGPL, AFPL and bstring licensing.

Early life Faulds was born in Beith, North Ayrshire, into a family of modest means. Aged 13, he was forced to leave school, and went to Glasgow to work as a clerk to help support his family; at 21 he decided to enroll at the Facility of Arts at Glasgow University, where he studied mathematics, logic and the classics. He later studied medicine at Anderson's College, and graduated with a physician's licence. Following graduation, Faulds then became a medical missionary for the Church of Scotland. In 1871, he was sent to British India, where he worked for two years in Darjeeling at a hospital for the poor. On 23 July 1873, he received a letter of appointment from the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland to establish a medical mission in Japan. He married Isabella Wilson that September, and the newlyweds departed for Japan in December. Life in Japan Faulds established the first English speaking mission in Japan in 1874, with a hospital and a teaching facility for Japanese medical students. He helped introduce Joseph Lister's antiseptic methods to Japanese surgeons. In 1875, he helped found the Rakuzenkai, Japan's first society for the blind, and set up lifeguard stations to prevent drowning in nearby canals. He halted a rabies epidemic that killed small children who played with infected mice, and he helped stop the spread of cholera in Japan. He even cured a plague infecting the local fishmonger's stock of carp. In 1880 he helped found a school for the blind. By 1882, his Tsukiji Hospital in Tokyo treated 15,000 patients annually. Faulds became fluent in Japanese, and in addition to his full-time work as a doctor, he wrote two books on travel in the Far East, many academic articles, and started three magazines. Whilst accompanying a friend (American archaeologist, Edward S. Morse) to an archaeological dig he noticed how the delicate impressions left by craftsmen could be discerned in ancient clay fragments. Examining his own fingertips and those of friends, he became convinced that the pattern of ridges was unique to each individual. Shortly after these observations his hospital was broken into. The local police arrested a member of staff whom Faulds believed to be innocent. Determined to exonerate the man, he compared the fingerprints left behind at the crime scene to those of the suspect and found them to be different. On the strength of this evidence the police agreed to release the suspect. In an attempt to promote the idea of fingerprint identification he sought the help of the noted naturalist Charles Darwin. Darwin declined to work on the idea, but passed it on to his relative Francis Galton, who forwarded it to the Anthropological Society of London. When Galton returned to the topic some eight years later, he paid little attention to Faulds' letter. As a result of this interchange some controversy has arisen about the inventor of modern forensic fingerprinting. However, there can be no doubt that Faulds' first paper on the subject was published in the scientific journal Nature in 1880; all parties conceded this. The following month Sir William Herschel, a British civil servant based in India, wrote to Nature saying that he had been using fingerprints (as a form of bar code) to identify criminals since 1860. However, Herschel did not mention their potential for forensic use. Over the years, Faulds conducted a bitter controversy with Herschel over the use of fingerprints, demanding proof in 1894 that Herschel had ever used fingerprints officially, which Herschel duly provided, and then writing a series of books and pamphlets many years later containing variations of the argument that he had been cheated his due credit (seeHistoric Works on Fingerprints. galton.org for complete facsimiles of these and other fundamental works on fingerprinting, and the Herschel/Faulds letters). These books were published from 1905 onward, long after fingerprinting had come into widespread use. Return to Britain Returning to Britain in 1886, after a quarrel with the missionary society which ran his hospital in Japan, Faulds offered the concept of fingerprint identification to Scotland Yard but he was dismissed, most likely because he did not present the extensive evidence required to show that prints are durable, unique and practically classifiable. Subsequently, Faulds returned to the life of a police surgeon, at first in London, and then in the Stoke-on-Trent town of Fenton. In 1922 he sold his practice and moved to James Street in nearby Wolstanton where he died in March 1930 aged 86, bitter at the lack of recognition he had received for his work. In 2007 a plaque acknowledging Faulds' work was unveiled at Bank House, near to Wolstanton's St Margaret's churchyard where his grave can be seen. In 2011, a plaque was unveiled at his former James Street residence. On 12 November 2004 a memorial was dedicated to his memory in Beith town centre close to the site of the house in New Street where he was born. Legacy The method of identifying criminals by their fingerprints had been introduced in the 1860s by Sir William James Herschel in India, and their potential use in forensic work was first proposed by in 1880. Galton, following the idea written by Faulds, which he failed to credit, was the first to place the study on a scientific footing, which assisted its acceptance by the courts. The Japanese police officially adopted the fingerprinting system in 1911. His clinic in Tokyo was bought by Ludolph Teusler and became St. Luke's International Hospital.

Maturin (25 September 1780 ‚Äì 30 October 1824), was an Irish Protestant clergyman (ordained in the Church of Ireland) and a writer of Gothic plays and novels.Chris Morgan, \\"Maturin, Charles R(obert).\\" in St. James Guide to Horror, Gothic, and Ghost Writers, ed. David Pringle. Detroit and New York: St. James Press, 1998. (396-97) His best known work is the novel Melmoth the Wanderer. Early life Maturin was descended from Huguenots who found shelter in Ireland, one of whom was Gabriel Jacques Maturin who became Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin after Jonathan Swift in 1745. Charles Robert Maturin was born in Dublin and attended Trinity College. Shortly after being ordained as curate of Loughrea, County Galway, in 1803, he moved back to Dublin as curate of St Peter's Church. He lived in York Street with his father William, a Post Office official, and his mother, Fedelia Watson, and married on 7 October 1804 the acclaimed singer Henrietta Kingsbury.  Works  His first three works were Gothic novels published under the pseudonym Dennis Jasper Murphy, and were critical and commercial failures. They did, however, catch the attention of Sir Walter Scott, who recommended Maturin's work to Lord Byron. With their help, Maturin's play Bertram was staged in 1816 at the Drury Lane for 22 nights, with Edmund Kean starring in the lead role as Bertram.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, vol. 17, Cambridge 1911, p. 903 Financial success, however, eluded Maturin, as the play's run coincided with his father's unemployment and another relative's bankruptcy, both of them assisted by the fledgling writer. To make matters worse, Samuel Taylor Coleridge publicly denounced the play as dull and loathsome, and \\"melancholy proof of the depravation of the public mind\\",Maturin, Melmoth the Wanderer (1820) from the course The Gothic Subject by David S. Miall, Department of English, University of Alberta, Autumn 2000 going nearly so far as to decry it as atheistic. The Church of Ireland took note of these and earlier criticisms and, having discovered the identity of Bertrams author (Maturin had shed his nom de plume to collect the profits from the play), subsequently barred Maturin's further clerical advancement. Forced to support his wife and four children by writing (his salary as curate was ¬£80-90 per annum, compared to the ¬£1000 he made for Bertram), he switched back from playwright to novelist after a string of his plays met with failure. He produced several novels in addition to Melmoth the Wanderer, including some on Irish subjects and The Albigenses, a historical novel which features werewolves. Various poems have also been ascribed to Maturin on dubious grounds and appear to be the work of others. The prize-winning \\"Lines on the Battle of Waterloo\\" was published in 1816 under the name of the university graduate John Shee. \\"The Universe\\" appeared with Maturin's name on the title page in 1821, but is now thought to be almost completely the work of James Wills.The Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature: 1800-1900, 1999, p.957 The exaggerated effectiveness of Maturin's preaching can be gauged from the two series of sermons that he published. On the occasion of the death of Princess Charlotte, he declared: \\"Life is full of death; the steps of the living cannot press the earth without disturbing the ashes of the dead ‚Äì we walk upon our ancestors ‚Äì the globe itself is one vast churchyard.\\" A contemporary account records that there had seldom been seen such crowds at St Peter's. \\"Despite the severe weather, people of all persuasions flocked to the church and listened spellbound to this prince of preachers. In his obituary it was said that, 'did he leave no other monument whereon to rest his fame, these sermons alone would be sufficient'.\\"Maturin family history online Maturin died in Dublin on 30 October 1824. A writer in the University Magazine was later to sum up his character as \\"eccentric almost to insanity and compounded of opposites ‚Äì an insatiable reader of novels; an elegant preacher; an incessant dancer; a coxcomb in dress and manners.\\"\\"A Compendium of Irish Biography\\", Dublin 1878, the article on Charles Robert Maturin International reputation In 1821 Maturin's successful play was adapted into French as Bertram, ou le Pirate by Charles Nodier and Baron Isidore Justin S√©verin Taylor, and ran successfully for 53 nights in the following year. This version was the source for the even more successful opera Il pirata, with a libretto by Felice Romani and music by Vincenzo Bellini, premiered at La Scala of Milan in 1827. Victor Hugo admired the play and Alexandre Dumas based his Antony upon its hero in 1831. The play was also printed and frequently produced in the United States. The novel Melmoth the Wanderer was also published in French translation in 1821 and served as an influential model for writers in France. In 1835 Honor√© de Balzac wrote a parody, Melmoth Reconcili√©, in which Maturin's hero goes to Paris, where he finds in its banking world an ethos that \\"has replaced the principle of honour by the principle of money\\" and easily finds someone to accept damnation in his place. In Balzac's eyes, \\"this novel is taken up with the same idea to which we already owe the drama of Faust and out of which Lord Byron has cut his cloth since Manfred\\". Charles Baudelaire was also an admirer of Maturin's novel, equating it with the poetry of Byron and Edgar Allan Poe.See the introduction to the Penguin edition of the novel, 2000 Family connections A sister of Maturin's wife married Charles Elgee, whose daughter Jane Francesca became the mother of Oscar Wilde. Thus Charles Maturin was Oscar Wilde's great-uncle by marriage.Dawidziak, Mark (2008). The bedside, bathtub, and armchair companion to Dracula. Continuum, p. 29. Wilde discarded his own name and adopted the name of Maturin's novel, Melmoth, during his exile in France.Lovecraft, Howard Phillips (2010). Supernatural Horror in Literature, The Modern Library, p. 119. Maturin's eldest son, William Basil Kingsbury Maturin, followed him into the ministry, as did several of his grandsons. One of these, Basil W. Maturin, died in the sinking of in 1915. The second son was Edward Maturin, who emigrated to the United States and became a novelist and poet there. William Maturin (1803‚Äì1887), a Tractarian, was the Church of Ireland priest at Grangegorman and also librarian of Archbishop Marsh's Library, Dublin, from 1872 until 1887.Muriel McCarthy, Marsh's Library: All Graduates and Gentlemen. 2nd ed.

The priority right allows the claimant to file a subsequent application in another country for the same invention, design, or trademark effective as of the date of filing the first application. When filing the subsequent application, the applicant must claim the priority of the first application in order to make use of the right of priority. The right of priority belongs to the applicant or his successor in title. The period of priority, i.e., the period during which the priority right exists, is usually 6 months for industrial designs and trademarks and 12 months for patents and utility models. The period of priority is often referred to as the priority year for patents and utility models. In patent law, when a priority is validly claimed, the date of filing of the first application, called the priority date, is considered to be the effective date of filing for the examination of novelty and inventive step or non-obviousness for the subsequent application claiming the priority of the first application. In other words, the prior art which is taken into account for examining the novelty and inventive step or non- obviousness of the invention claimed in the subsequent application would not be everything made available to the public before the filing date (of the subsequent application) but everything made available to the public before the priority date, i.e. the date of filing of the first application.  Rationale  The \\"basic purpose [of the right of priority] is to safeguard, for a limited period, the interests of a patent applicant in his endeavour to obtain international protection for his invention, thereby alleviating the negative consequences of the principle of territoriality in patent law.\\"Decision T 15/01 of June 17, 2004 of the Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office. . See also Decision T 577/11 of 14 April 2016, Reasons 6.5.3, 5th paragraph: \\"The creation of the right of priority was aimed at protecting the rights of the applicant of a first application for an invention in all countries of the Paris Union by securing the filing date as the effective date for the definition of the state of the art. This was to enable the applicant to decide, within a certain period, in which other countries protection should be sought in respect of the same invention and to prepare for such subsequent filings which, in the absence of a centralised filing system, were still required at that time. In the event of such subsequent filings, other applications or disclosures occurring in the priority period were to have no negative effect as regards the patentability of the invention (see Article 4B Paris Convention).\\"  Types   Convention priority right  The \\"Paris Convention priority right\\", also called \\"Convention priority right\\" or \\"Union priority right\\", is a \\"priority right\\" under a multilateral arrangement, defined by Article 4 of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 1883. The Convention priority right is probably the most widely known priority right. It is defined by its Article 4 A.(1): Article 4 B. of the Paris Convention describes the effects of the priority right: Article 2 paragraph 1 of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs Agreement) in conjunction with the Paris Convention provides a \\"derived\\" Convention priority right.Article 27 TRIPs Agreement That is, while WTO members need not ratify the Paris Convention, they should however comply with Articles 1 through 12, and Article 19, of the Paris Convention. (For a comparative list of the States party to the Paris Convention and the members of the WTO, see for instance States Party to PCT/Paris/WTO] on the WIPO web siteStates Party to PCT/Paris/WTO on the WIPO web site (Adobe PDF)).  Priority rights under other multilateral arrangements  Some priority rights are defined by a multilateral convention such as the European Patent Convention (EPC) or the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). The Paris Convention does not cover priorities claimed _in_ a European patent application or _in_ an international application (or PCT application), as the EPC and the PCT have their own legal provisions regarding priority. = European Patent Convention = defines the priority right system under the EPC or more precisely recognise priority rights for first filings in or for States party to the Paris Convention or any Member of the World Trade Organization (WTO):Under the European Patent Convention (EPC), rights of priority may be obtained from the filing of patent applications in Members of the World Trade Organization which are not party to the Paris Convention since December 13, 2007, the date of entry into force of the EPC 2000, the revised version of the EPC. describes the effect of the priority right: As explained by the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office (EPO) in its decision G 3/93 of August 16, 1994 (Reasons 4): Regarding the critical question \\"What is 'the same invention'?\\" in , opinion G 2/98 prescribes a photographic approach to the assessment of priority.Hans-Rainer Jaenichen, Olaf Malek, The Assessment of priority cannot demand more than science can deliver or: How to apply the photographic approach in consideration of the resolving of the pictures taken, epi Information 3/2008, pp. 91-102. According to Enlarged Board of Appeal opinion G 2/98, the requirement for claiming priority of \\"the same invention\\" means that priority of a previous application in respect of a claim in a European patent application is to be acknowledged only if the skilled person can derive the subject-matter of the claim directly and unambiguously, using common general knowledge, from the previous application as a whole.European Patent Office, Opinion of the Enlarged Board of Appeal dated 31 May 2001, G 2/98, point 9: \\"It means that priority of a previous application in respect of a claim in a European patent application in accordance with Article 88 EPC is to be acknowledged only if the person skilled in the art can derive the subject-matter of the claim directly and unambiguously, using common general knowledge, from the previous application as a whole.\\" = Patent Cooperation Treaty = The Patent Cooperation Treaty, in its Article 8(1), provides the possibility of claiming a right of priority for the filing of an international application (PCT application): goes on to mention that: However, Rule 4.10(a) as amended with effect from January 1, 2000 does not apply to all designated Offices.Rule 4, note 1, Patent Cooperation Treaty For instance, for the European Patent Office as designated Office, the old Rule 4.10(a) still applied until December 12, 2007, that is, rights of priority of first applications made in a WTO member not party to the Paris Convention were not recognised. Now and more specifically for European patent applications filed on or after December 13, 2007 (the entry into force of the new version of the European Patent Convention, the so- called EPC 2000), the rights of priority of first applications made in a WTO member are recognized under the European Patent Convention.Special edition of the Official Journal of the EPO 4/2007 - Revision of the European Patent Convention (EPC 2000). Synoptic presentation EPC 1973/2000 ‚Äì Part I: The Articles, 2007 (PDF, 1.72 MB), page 88.  Internal priority rights  Some priority rights, called \\"internal priority rights\\", are defined by some national laws.For instance, in Canada: Manual of Patent Office Practice (MOPOP), Chapter 7: Internal priority and convention priority. Such internal priority right allows an applicant who filed a first application in a given country to claim the priority of the first application when filing a subsequent application in the same country. The Paris Convention does not cover internal priority rights. See, e.g., provisional application in the US.''  Priority rights under bilateral agreements  Some priority rights also exist on the basis of bilateral agreements.For instance, bilateral agreements with Taiwan: Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan), Taiwan's commitment to protect intellectual property rights. Cooperative Agreements Signed between Taiwan with Other Nations , Consulted on November 11, 2007.. Agreement No. 3 \\"Mutual Recognition of Invention Patent Priority Right with Germany\\", No. 5 \\"Mutual Recognition of Patent Priority Right with Switzerland\\", etc... are bilateral agreements on priority rights for patents. Other bilateral agreements relate to trademarks and industrial designs. A bilateral agreement between a first and a second country may allow an applicant who filed an application in the first country to claim the priority of the first application when filing a second application in the second country. These kinds of bilateral agreements usually involve at least one country not party to the Paris Convention.  Example  An example may help to understand the legal concept of priority right. The example presented here illustrates the case of the priority right in patent law, but the example could be extended to trademarks, taking into account the difference of priority period (12 months for patents, 6 months for trademarks). Ms. A's hypothetical improved mousetrap. Let us imagine the following scenario. Ms. A has invented an improved mousetrap and decides to apply for a patent on her mousetrap. She first files a German patent application on July 15, 2006. Starting from July 16, 2006,The day of filing is not included in the period - Article 4 C.(2) Paris Convention. Ms. A has then one year to file patent applications in other countries to be able to benefit from the date of filing of the German patent application in these other countries. If Ms. A files on July 15, 2007 a patent application in the United Kingdom (UK) for her mousetrap, and if, upon filing the patent application in the United Kingdom, Ms. A claims the priority of the earliest German patent application filed one year before,Under some jurisdictions, the priority claim need not be made upon filing. In the specific example used for instance, i.e. filing the patent application in the United Kingdom, Ms. A does not have to declare priority claim on filing. She has actually until 16 months from the claimed priority date to provide the number and certified copy of the earlier application using Patents Form 3 and paying ¬£40, provided there was no early publication of new application (see Patent Rules 2007, Rule 6). In addition (still in the specific example of filing the patent application in the United Kingdom), she could file an application up to two months after expiry of priority period and still validly claim priority using Patents Form 3 and paying ¬£190 (which includes a late fee of ¬£150) and filing evidence to show that the failure to meet the original deadline was unintentional (see Patents Act 1977, section 5(2B) and the Patent Rules 2007, rule 7)). the date for examining the novelty and inventive step requirements in the United Kingdom will be July 15, 2006, not July 15, 2007. This means that any disclosure to the public of the improved mousetrap on or after July 15, 2006 (by Ms. A or anyone else) will not prejudice Ms. A's patent application in the United Kingdom. If Mr. B independently invents around January 2007 the same improved mousetrap and decides to directly publish in February 2007 a paper explaining how his new mousetrap works, the publication of the paper by Mr. B will not affect the novelty of Ms. A's patent application in the United Kingdom, even though the publication of Mr. B's paper takes place before the actual date of filing of Ms. A's UK patent application. The priority system, including this one-year priority right, enables Ms. A to file a patent application as soon as possible in one country (in this case in Germany, and in the German language), and gives her one-year to do whatever is necessary to file patent applications in other countries (translating the text of the application, filling the application forms, sending the translated application and forms to the foreign patent offices, collecting the funds to pay the filing fees, and so on) without being affected by any intervening publication. The actual date of filing in the United Kingdom remains July 15, 2007, and this is the date from which the 20-year duration of any ensuing patent is calculated. The example also applies to many other countries, such as to all countries which are party to the Paris Convention.Example: filed on September 16, 2005 claims priority of a first filing in the US on September 17, 2004.  Special considerations   Partial priority  The extent to which a partial priority can be acknowledged for a single claim in a patent application -i.e., only for a part of the claim, for which the subject-matter is disclosed in the priority document- is a delicate question.For a discussion of the question, see for example Decision T 0571/10 of 3 June 2014 of Board of Appeal 3.3.07 of the European Patent Office.

He was founder of the Dyson Kissner-Moran Corporation (founded in 1954) and the Dyson Foundation (founded in 1957). Business career Dyson began his career in 1932 as an accountant at Price Waterhouse & Company. After a two-year tour as a chartered accountant in England with Price Waterhouse & Company, Dyson was rewarded by being named a manager when he returned to the United States in 1938. He remained with the company until he was recruited to government service for the Lend Lease Program. After the war, he returned to the business world as the Executive Vice President of Finance of the Textron Corporation under its founder, Royal (Roy) Little. In 1949, he moved to Burlington Mills Corporation where he served as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer under President Spencer Love. In 1954, he founded the Dyson Corporation (now Dyson Kissner-Moran Corporation), a private investment firm specializing in acquisitions and mergers. Military career Dyson was recruited by the Federal government as a civilian to help set up the procurement and record keeping for the Lend Lease Program. At the U.S. declaration of World War II, he was drafted into the same position as a lieutenant in the Army Air Force. During his military service, the War Department assigned him to the Treasury Department to assist the Treasury Secretary, Henry Morgenthau, Jr. and Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. The UNMFC was created to set the post-war exchange rates for world currencies, principally the dollar, franc, pound, and the German mark. For his diverse and distinguished service, Dyson was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. Charitable interests In 1957, Dyson and wife Margaret Dyson (1914‚Äì1990) created the Dyson Foundation, one of the wealthiest charities in the United States. In 2004, the foundation had approximately $295,000,000 in assets and awarded over $16.3 million in grants.

The character was portrayed by actor Andy Hallett. Biography Character history Lorne was born as Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan in the demonic dimension of Pylea. Lorne, as he prefers to be called, wasn't like his fellow Deathwok clan demons: bloodthirsty \\"champions\\" constantly undertaking quests against evil. He is a gentle soul who does not share his kin's prejudice against humans (or \\"cows\\" as they are called in his world). Lorne would rather flirt with the female demons and enjoy life than train to be a fighter. He also enjoyed beauty, art, and even music, which was difficult, considering his world had no music. Lorne refused to train his innate mystical senses to learn to hunt beasts and is considered the shame of his clan. In 1996, Lorne happened upon a dimensional portal and was sucked through it (his future friend Winifred Burkle was sucked into Pylea through that same portal). He landed in Los Angeles and discovered music and culture like he never imagined. Lorne learned to hone his mystical senses to read people's auras, but found it easiest to do so when they sang, baring their souls. He opened up a karaoke bar on the same spot that he arrived on Earth, an old abandoned building. Lorne contracted the Transuding Furies to cast a sanctuary spell on the spot, which stopped any demon violence from occurring on it. He named the bar \\"Caritas\\", the Latin word for \\"charity\\", and allowed anyone, good or evil, to become a patron. At some point he befriended psychic Agnes \\"Aggie\\" Belfleur, whom he later visits in the episode \\"Over the Rainbow\\". Caritas became a success in the morally ambiguous Los Angeles underground scene. To most who visited the bar, Lorne was simply called \\"The Host\\". He later states he did not use the name \\"Lorne\\" in this dimension, because his striking green skin prompted people to make Lorne Greene jokes. Lorne is reluctant at times to help Angel and the other heroes of the series, preferring to maintain a neutral stance and simply provide a peaceful place for all demons, but his essential goodness usually wins out over his reticence. He starts off by giving the characters advice and encouragement, but as time goes on, he becomes more directly involved in the cases of Angel Investigations‚Äîeven asking for Angel's help to avert the end of the world when Angel had severed ties with the rest of the group after Darla's resurrection‚Äîand his many contacts in Los Angeles' magical underworld prove useful. Angel even admits severing ties with them was to keep them from a path they couldn't handle, having no desire to do anything worse than fire them, such as forcing them to participate in punishing the guilty and getting them killed by Wolfran & Hart, Darla, Drusilla, or in general. Angel wanted them to hate him forever, especially for the horrible things he was doing to prevent the end of the world. Lorne did not find a way to reveal all this to them, which Angel didn't want them to know, feeling they were better off that way instead of dead or forced to do terrible things against their will. Lorne reluctantly joins the team in their mission to Pylea to rescue Cordelia, discovering that he could incapacitate the natives by singing songs and causing them to cower from the \\"strange sorcery\\". On leaving, he decides returning to Pylea had been good for him as it had reaffirmed he did not belong there and was right to stay away. In Season Three of Angel, Caritas is raided by Charles Gunn's old gang (as the magical barrier prevents only demonic violence, not human violence) and it is temporarily put out of action, finally being completely destroyed by Daniel Holtz. After that, Lorne moves to the Hyperion Hotel and finds himself becoming far more attached to the AI team, and he often looks after the infant Connor while Angel is on business. While there, he also discovers that Gavin Park had the Hyperion Hotel bugged, and A.I. manages to destroy them. Eventually, he leaves to start a singing career in Las Vegas, Nevada. Unfortunately, a crime lord forces him, under threat of killing innocents, to use his empathic abilities to locate audience members with promising futures so he can steal them. Back in L.A. after being rescued by Angel, Gunn and Fred, Lorne helps restore Cordelia's lost memories and is part of the fight against the resulting Jasmine crisis. In the show's fifth and final season, Lorne finds himself the new head of Wolfram & Hart's Entertainment Division, at first fitting into the job with relative ease and making various business deals in the film industry. As time goes on, his kindness is slowly replaced by a growing cynicism and self-loathing of his position of \\"cheerleader\\" for Angel and his friends, particularly when Gunn is abandoned in a Hell dimension to recover Lindsey McDonald because Lindsey could possess information they needed; Lorne had always assumed they didn't leave anyone behind. When his close friend Fred is murdered and her body usurped by the Old One known as Illyria, Lorne becomes filled with despair which he keeps secret from the rest of his equally heartbroken friends. By the conclusion of the series, he announces he is leaving Los Angeles after carrying out his part in Angel's plan to destroy the Circle of the Black Thorn. When Lorne learns what his part is to be, he tells Angel \\"I'll do this last thing for you, for us... but then I'm out, and you won't find me in the alley afterwards. Hell, you won't find me at all. Do me a favor. Don't try.\\" Lorne's part is to betray and murder longtime enemy-turned-ally Lindsey, who in his final words mutters at the unfairness of being killed by Lorne, a \\"flunky\\", and not his longtime rival Angel. In his final scene, after shooting Lindsey with a silenced pistol, a disgusted and broken Lorne walks off into the darkness. He drops the gun and simply says, \\"Goodnight, folks\\" as he leaves. Literature In the canonical comic book continuation Angel: After the Fall, Lorne is wandering the streets of L.A. when the entire town is sent into hell. He simply flees in a demonic taxicab instead of assisting against the resulting demonic invasion. However, the cab is destroyed and Lorne finds himself watching civilians in Silver Lake fighting back. He assists them with his vocal powers. Though they are soon joined by a sorceress, many Silver Lake residents die before a permanent demon-free area is established. The people elect Lorne as their leader. Lorne tries to remain neutral as Angel battles the various Demon Lords that had overtaken the rest of Los Angeles. However, he soon changes his mind and throws in fully with his old friends. The Demon Lords are slain and Lorne becomes the chosen ruler of all of L.A. Later, Lorne and the entire town are sent back to Earth, all slain are now alive again. Only memories of Hell remain. As with his friends, Lorne is now famous for his good deeds. Angel #18 onwards continues the narrative of After the Fall. In '\\"Angel: Aftermath\\", it is mentioned in passing by Angel to Connor that Lorne is \\"putting his life back together\\", and is briefly seen entering the door of a business. In March 2010 IDW released the special one-shot \\"Angel: Lorne - Music of the Spheres\\", written and drawn by John Byrne as a tribute to the late Andy Hallett. In this story it transpires that Lorne has developed cancer, possibly due to doing something 'that was completely and utterly against (his) nature' (i.e. killing Lindsey). As the tale progresses three demons, Discord, Disharmony and Cacophony, attempt to destroy all the multiverses by affecting the \\"Music of the Spheres\\". Angel, Illyria, the Groosalugg and Lorne intercept them just as they release three notes which will destroy the universe, causing the center to unbalance. Lorne realises that he has to \\"become the new center\\", and he jumps into the abyss, closing the portal. At the end of the story, Angel realises that he's \\"at one with the universe now. But...I'd like to think that he can still hear us. And that he knows how much he's missed.\\" Lorne has been narrating the story all along and replies, \\"Oh, I can hear you Angelcakes, and it's music to my ears.\\" Powers and abilities Lorne can read people's auras, and their futures, whilst they are singing. For some time he would use this to give the singers emotional advice. Lorne can also read their thoughts and emotions when he does this, although he has shown an ability to read basic details about auras even without singing, and can gain considerable knowledge of others when they are in emotional distress. Like other members of his clan, Lorne is immune to the intoxicating effects of normal alcohol, but can get drunk by ingesting certain magical brews. He can hear outside the normal human range; at one point he tunes into transmission frequencies. He can also generate tones painful to human hearing. He can adjust it to different effects, from damaging lightbulbs to destroying demons. Unique to his clan is the ability to survive the complete removal of his limbs and even beheading, unless his body is mutilated after the dismemberment. In the episode \\"Life of the Party\\", Lorne's lack of sleep causes his subconscious to use his powers differently. Instead of reading destinies, he starts to write them, granting him a sort of mind control/suggestion power. By making sarcastic comments to the rest of the team, he inadvertently transforms Spike's cynic personality into optimistic and super-positive, makes Wesley and Fred act extremely drunk despite very little alcohol, causes Gunn to urinate all over the Wolfram & Hart building (he had told Gunn to \\"stake out his territory\\", resulting in literally marking his territory in a manner similar to animals), and influences Angel to have sex with Eve after sarcastically commenting on the sexual tension between the two. His subconscious, unable to cope with the conflicts Lorne usually handled in his sleep, then manifests as an astral projection which possesses superhuman strength and durability. This enlarged version then attacks several demons that had recently angered Lorne. These powers were lost when Lorne's ability to sleep returns to him.  Character development  Andy Hallett worked in Los Angeles as the personal assistant to Kai Cole, the wife of Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon. When the couple and their friends saw Hallett singing at the \\"B.B. Kings\\" lounge at Universal CityWalk, Whedon conceived of Lorne as an anagogic demon who reads the hearts and futures of his guests as they sing in his karaoke bar. Hallett was invited to try out for the part, and won it after three auditions.Bratton, Kristy and Ritchie, Jeff. \\"All This and Heaven Too\\" , Andy Hallett interview, City of Angel magazine, December 2001.

He made many traditionally animated films that were delicate in style, satirical, and lyrical in nature. His most important work is Le Roi et l'oiseau, which ultimately took over 30 years to produce. He began it as La Berg√®re et le Ramoneur (The Shepherdess and the Chimneysweep) in 1948 and it was highly anticipated, but Grimault's partner Andr√© Sarrut showed the film unfinished in 1952, against Grimault's wishes. This caused a rift between partners and a stop in production. In 1967, Grimault got possession of the film and subsequently was able to complete it in 1980 under a new title, Le Roi et l'oiseau, incorporating some footage from the original and re-hiring the original animators, together with some new, younger ones. There are many names for it in English that have been used in various releases, including: The King and the Bird (literal), The King and the Mockingbird, The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird and The King and Mr. Bird (1980). He also collected his best shorts in a retrospective compilation movie, La table tournante (1988), which is included in the deluxe edition of Le Roi et l'oiseau. For a detailed bibliography, see this reference.  Les G√©meaux  In 1936 Grimault founded, with Andr√© Sarrut, Les G√©meaux, which was the second significant French animation venture, following the work of √âmile Cohl, which had closed years earlier. During World War II, Americans films being unavailable, its films found a captive audience. The studio produced a number of shorts, then closed its doors in 1952 following the expense of making La Berg√®re et le Ramoneur, which was the first feature-length French animated movie.  Other work  Grimault was part of the agitprop group Groupe Octobre. At this group he met Jacques Pr√©vert, with whom he went on to collaborate on several animated films, most notably Le roi et l'oiseau.

His execution was the first in the state of California since 1967. Harris was born in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and was abused as a child. He had run-ins with police as early as age 10, and was first placed into juvenile detention at age 13 for stealing a car. His mother abandoned him at age 14 and he was soon after placed into juvenile detention after stealing another car. Following his release he found work, married, and had a son. In 1975 he was imprisoned for manslaughter and paroled in January 1978. On July 5, 1978, Harris and his younger brother commandeered a car occupied by two 16-year-old boys, John Mayeski and Michael Baker, ordered them to drive to a remote area, then killed them. The brothers then used the car as their getaway car when they robbed a bank in San Diego. He was arrested less than an hour after the robbery and charged with murder, auto theft, kidnapping, burglary, and bank robbery. One of the arresting officers, Steve Baker, was the father of one of the murdered boys, but did not realize the victim was his son until later. Harris was convicted and sentenced to death on March 6, 1979. After a series of appeals and stays of execution, he was executed in San Quentin's gas chamber on April 21, 1992. Early life and criminal record/history Robert Alton Harris was born at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, the fifth of nine children of Kenneth and Evelyn Harris. Kenneth was a sergeant in the United States Army who was awarded a Silver Star and Purple Heart for his service in World War II. Both parents were alcoholics, and Robert reportedly was born two months premature as a result of Kenneth kicking Evelyn in the abdomen; Robert is also reported to have suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome. Robert was especially targeted for abuse by his father, who believed that Robert was conceived in an affair. The Harris family moved to Visalia, California in 1962 following Kenneth Harris' discharge from the Army. Kenneth Harris was jailed in 1963 for 18 months and again for a longer period of time in 1964, both times for sexually abusing his daughters. With Kenneth in jail, the remaining family members lived a migrant life around the San Joaquin Valley. Robert spent four months in juvenile hall at age 13 for stealing a car. During his time at the juvenile detention centre, Harris was repeatedly raped.Vogel, Lawrence. 1993. \\"Understanding and Blaming: Problems in the Attribution of Moral Responsibility\\". Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 53 (1). [International Phenomenological Society, Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, Wiley]: 129‚Äì42. doi:10.2307/2108057. In 1967, Evelyn abandoned Robert, then 14, in Sacramento and left him to fend for himself. After making his way to Oklahoma to live with his brother and sister, he stole a car and was subsequently arrested in Florida. He spent the next three years in the Florida juvenile detention system, but when he turned 19, the system could no longer keep him, and he was sent to Chula Vista, California. In June 1973 Harris married, and the couple had a son, Robert, Jr., born in October 1974. In 1975 while living in a trailer park in Imperial County, Harris beat his brother's roommate to death, claiming he did so to protect the victim's wife; however, it was later determined that he beat the victim without provocation. He was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and imprisoned in San Luis Obispo; during his imprisonment Harris' wife filed for divorce. Harris was paroled in January 1978. San Diego murders Sometime in May or June 1978, Robert, then aged 25, asked his brother Daniel, 18, for help in planning a bank robbery. On July 2, Daniel stole two guns from a neighbor's house in Visalia, California, and the two drove to San Diego that night. They spent the next two days purchasing ammunition and practicing the robbery in a rural area near Miramar Lake. On July 5, the Harris brothers happened upon John Mayeski and Michael Baker, both 16, sitting in a green Ford LTD eating hamburgers in a supermarket parking lot in Mira Mesa. Mayeski and Baker were best friends who had planned to spend the day fishing to celebrate Mayeski's newly acquired driver's license. Robert Harris commandeered Mayeski's car and ordered him to drive to Miramar Lake, with Daniel Harris following in another vehicle. Robert Harris told the boys that they would be using the vehicle to rob a bank, but that no one would be hurt. At Miramar Lake, the Harris brothers ordered the boys to kneel, whereupon the boys began to pray. Robert told the boys to \\"Quit crying, and die like men\\", then shot both boys multiple times. The Harris brothers then returned to Robert's Mira Mesa home and finished the victims' half-eaten hamburgers while Robert boasted about the killings. About an hour later, the Harris brothers robbed the Mira Mesa branch of the San Diego Trust and Savings Bank located across the street from where they had abducted Mayeski and Baker, and fled with about $2,000. A witness to the robbery followed the Harrises to their home and notified police. The Harris brothers were arrested less than an hour after the robbery. One of the officers who apprehended the Harris brothers was Steven Baker, father of victim Michael Baker, who at the time was unaware that his son had been killed, let alone by one of the men he was arresting. Conviction and execution Robert Alton Harris in 1985 The San Diego County District Attorney's Office filed felony charges of auto theft, kidnapping, murder and burglary against Robert Harris, while the U.S. Attorney's Office filed bank robbery charges against him. On March 6, 1979, Robert Harris was convicted in the San Diego County Superior Court of two counts of murder in the first degree with special circumstances as well as two counts of kidnapping, and was sentenced to death. Daniel Harris was convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to six years in state prison; he was released in 1983. An appeal for clemency to California governor Pete Wilson ‚Äì who was mayor of San Diego at the time of the killings ‚Äì was rejected in a live television news conference, where Wilson read a statement acknowledging Harris' abusive childhood but ended with a clear rejection of the clemency request, saying, \\"As great as is my compassion for Robert Harris the child, I cannot excuse or forgive the choice made by Robert Harris the man.\\"Janet Golden, \\"An Argument That Goes Back to the Womb: The Demedicalization of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, 1973-1992,\\" Journal of Social HIstory, Vol. 33, 1999 Wilson then left without waiting for reporters' questions. Harris' death sentence was affirmed by the Supreme Court of California in 1981.People v. Harris, 623 P.2d 240, 28 Cal. 3d 935, 171 Cal. Rptr. 679 (1981). In 1982, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted a writ of habeas corpus relieving Harris of the death sentence, vacating a contrary district court order. The Supreme Court of the United States reimposed Harris' death sentence in Pulley v. Harris (1984), reversing the Ninth Circuit by a vote of 7-2. In 1990, federal appeals court judge John T. Noonan Jr. issued a stay of execution, as Harris argued that childhood brain damage interfered with his judgment during his crimes. Harris was scheduled to die on April 21, 1992. On April 18, U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel issued a temporary restraining order barring Harris' execution while she considered his lawsuit challenging the gas chamber's constitutionality. On April 22, the Ninth Circuit issued an emergency writ of mandate vacating the restraining order, in which Judge Arthur Lawrence Alarc√≥n was joined by Judge Melvin T. Brunetti, over the dissent of Judge Noonan.See also: , , On April 20, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated a separate stay of execution the Ninth Circuit had issued on Harris' habeas corpus petition. That evening, a group of Ninth Circuit judges ordered the execution stayed while the circuit considered granting en banc consideration of his lawsuit. Later that evening, the Ninth Circuit entered a third stay blocking the execution while it reconsidered reimposing the lower court's temporary restraining order. That night, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a per curiam decision vacating the Ninth Circuit's stays and allowing the execution to proceed, by a vote of 7-2.Gomez v. United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 503 U.S. 653 (1992). On Tuesday, April 21, at 3:49 a.m., Harris was strapped into the gas chamber. Seconds before execution, Ninth Circuit Judge Harry Pregerson stayed the execution for the fourth time, explaining that Harris should be allowed to begin a new lawsuit in state court. Two hours later, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated that stay, explicitly ordering \\"No further stays of Robert Alton Harris' execution shall be entered by the federal courts except upon order of this Court.\\" Harris was executed on April 21, 1992, in the gas chamber at San Quentin State Prison‚Äîthe first execution in California in 25 years. For his last meal, he requested and was given a 21-piece bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken, two large Domino's pizzas, a bag of jelly beans, a six-pack of Pepsi, and a pack of Camel cigarettes. At 6:01 a.m., Harris was escorted into the gas chamber. The execution order was given at 6:07 a.m. PDT, and Harris died at 6:21 a.m. PDT. His body was removed from the chamber at 7:00 a.m. and was taken to a funeral home at 8:15 a.m. Harris' execution is specifically remembered for his choice of final words (recorded by Warden Daniel Vasquez): \\"You can be a king or a street sweeper, but everybody dances with the grim reaper.\\" It was the subject of a 1995 Dutch documentary film, Procedure 769, witness to an execution.

Dicofol is a miticide that is very effective against spider mite. One of the intermediates used in its production is DDT. This has caused criticism by many environmentalists; however, the World Health Organization classifies dicofol as a Level II, \\"moderately hazardous\\" pesticide. It is known to be harmful to aquatic animals, and can cause eggshell thinning in various species of birds.  Difference between dicofol and DDT  Dicofol is structurally similar to DDT. It differs from DDT by the replacement of the hydrogen (H) on C-1 by a hydroxyl (OH) functional group. One of the intermediates used in its production is DDT.  Chemistry  Dicofol is usually synthesized from technical DDT. During the synthesis, DDT is first chlorinated to an intermediate, Cl-DDT, followed by hydrolyzing to dicofol. After the synthesis reaction, DDT and Cl-DDT may remain in the dicofol product as impurities. * Formula: C14H9Cl5O * Chemical names: 2,2,2-Trichloro-1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethanol * Appearance: Pure dicofol is a white crystalline solid. Technical dicofol is a red-brown or amber viscous liquid with an odor like fresh-cut hay. * Solubility: It is stable under cool and dry conditions, is practically insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents. Solubility: 0.8 mg/l (25 ¬∞C) in water. * Melting Point: 78.5 - 79.5 ¬∞C for pure dicofol, 50 ¬∞C for technical dicofol * Vapor Pressure: Negligible at room temperature * Molecular Weight: 370.49 g/mol * Partition Coefficient: 4.2788 * Adsorption Coefficient: 5000 (estimated)  Impurities  Manufacturing-use dicofol products contain a number of DDT analogs as manufacturing impurities. These include the o,p' and p,p' isomers of DDT, DDE, DDD, and a substance called extra-chlorine DDT or Cl-DDT  Use and formulations  Foliar spray on agricultural crops and ornamentals, and in or around agricultural and domestic buildings for mite control. It is formulated as emulsifiable concentrates, wettable powders, dusts, ready-to-use liquids, and aerosol sprays. In many countries, dicofol is also used in combination with other pesticides such as the organophosphates, methyl parathion, and dimethoate.  Producers  Dicofol first appeared in the scientific literature in 1956, and was introduced onto the market by the US-based multinational company Rohm & Haas in 1957. Other current manufacturers include Hindustan Insecticides Limited (India), Lainco (Spain), and ADAMA Agricultural Solutions (Formerly Makhteshim-Agan) (Israel). It is sold under a number of trade names, including Hilfol, Kelthane and Acarin. In 1986, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) temporarily canceled the use of dicofol because relatively high levels of DDT contamination were ending up in the final product. Modern processes can produce technical grade dicofol that contains less than 0.1% DDT.  Estimated usage as a pesticide  The Pesticide Survey, USA 1987 through 1996, reports that the total annual domestic agricultural usage of dicofol averaged about 860,000 pounds active ingredient (a.i.) for about treated. Most of the area is treated with 2 pounds a.i. or less per application, and the average acre is treated with about 1.2 pounds a.i. per year (1.3 kg/(ha¬∑yr)). Fruits tend to have the highest application rates. The largest markets for dicofol in terms of total pounds active ingredient are cotton (over 50%) and citrus (almost 30%). Although only about 4% of the cotton acres grown are treated with dicofol, over 60% of all crop acres treated with dicofol are cotton acres. The remaining usage is primarily on other fruits and vegetables. Most of the US usage is in California and Florida.  Effects  The California Department of Food and Agriculture has one of the world's most extensive incident reporting systems. Between 1982 and 1992, 38 incidents involving dicofol alone were reported: systemic 19 (50%); skin 10 (26%); eye 8 (21%); and eye/skin 1 (3%). The number of incidents per 1,000 applications for all illnesses ranged from 0.11 to 0.21. The US National Pesticides Telecommunications Network database collected reports from 1984 to 1991 showing 91 human, 9 animal and 31 other poisoning incidents for a total of 131 incidents involving dicofol from 571 phone calls made to the hotline. An assessment of dicofol by the UK Pesticides Safety Directorate in 1996 found that residues in apples, pears, blackcurrants and strawberries were higher than expected. There is no established US maximum contaminant level (MCL) or health advisory levels for residues of dicofol in drinking water. In the European Union, the maximum level is the same for all active ingredients 0.1 mg/l. In 1990, the use of dicofol was suspended in Sweden for environmental reasons. In Switzerland its use is permitted for research purposes only. Throughout the European Union dicofol containing more than lg/kg (0.1%) of DDT or DDT related compounds cannot be used. The 1998 US EPA review of dicofol recommended a number of changes in order to protect the environment and wildlife. Dicofol applications are limited to no more than one per year. In the UK, the maximum number of treatments permitted is two per year for apples and hops, and two per crop for strawberries, protected crops and tomatoes. In 1980, an accident at the US Tower Chemical Company led to a release of dicofol into Lake Apopka in Florida. Ten years later Dr Guillette of Florida University linked this incident to a subsequent decline in the fertility of alligators in the lake. The US EPA is still not clear whether dicofol is involved in the reproductive failure of the alligator population following the accidental spill.  Toxicity  It is classified by the World Health Organisation as a Class II, 'moderately hazardous' pesticide. The acute oral for dicofol is 587 mg/kg for rats. Dicofol is a nerve poison. The exact mode of action is not known, although in mammals it causes hyperstimulation of nerve transmission along nerve axons (cells). This effect is thought to be related to the inhibition of certain enzymes in the central nervous system. Symptoms of ingestion and/or respiratory exposure include nausea, dizziness, weakness and vomiting; dermal exposure may cause skin irritation or a rash; and eye contact may cause conjunctivitis. Poisoning may affect the liver, kidneys or the central nervous system. Very severe cases may result in convulsions, coma, or death from respiratory failure. Dicofol can be stored in fatty tissue. Intense activity or starvation may mobilize the chemical, resulting in the reappearance of toxic symptoms long after actual exposure.  Chronic effects  Tests on laboratory animals show that the primary effects after long term exposure to dicofol include increases in liver weight and enzyme induction in the rat, mouse and dog. There are also effects relating to altered adrenocorticoid metabolism (part of the hormonal system). In the rat hormonal changes were accompanied by the histological observation of vacuolation (empty cavities) of the cells of the adrenal cortex.  Carcinogenecity  The US EPA has classified dicofol as a Group C, possible human carcinogen. There is limited evidence that it may cause cancer in laboratory animals, but there is no evidence that it causes cancer in humans. This classification was based on animal test data that showed an increase in the incidence of liver adenomas (benign tumour) and combined liver adenomas and carcinomas in male mice.  Reproductive effects  Reproductive effects in rat offspring have been observed only at doses high enough to also cause toxic effects on the livers, ovaries, and feeding behavior of the parents. Rats fed diets containing dicofol through two generations exhibited adverse effects on the survival and/or growth of newborns at 6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg/day * Teratogenic effects: No teratogenic effects are observed when rats were given up to 25 mg/kg/day on days 6 through 15 of pregnancy * Mutagenic effects: Laboratory tests have shown that dicofol is not mutagenic * Endocrine disruption: Evidence for dicofol to cause endocrine disruption is suggestive, but not definitive A 2007 study by the California Department of Public Health found that women in the first eight weeks of pregnancy who live near farm fields sprayed with dicofol and the related organochloride pesticide endosulfan are several times more likely to give birth to children with autism. These results are highly preliminary due to the small number of women and children involved and lack of evidence from other studies.  Metabolism  Dicofol is converted in rats to the metabolites 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone and 4,4'-dichlorodicofol. Studies of the metabolism of dicofol in rats, mice, and rabbits have shown that ingested dicofol is rapidly absorbed, distributed primarily to fat, and readily eliminated in feces. When mice were given a single oral dose of 25 mg/kg dicofol, approximately 60% of the dose was eliminated within 96 hours, 20% in the urine, and 40% in the feces. Concentrations in body tissues peaked between 24 and 48 hours following dosing, with 10% of the dose found in fat, followed by the liver and other tissues. Levels in tissues other than fat declined sharply after the peak.  Ecological effects  Effects on birds: Dicofol is slightly toxic to birds. The 8-day dietary LC50 is 3010 ppm in bobwhite quail, 1418 ppm in Japanese quail, and 2126 ppm in ring-necked pheasant. Eggshell thinning and reduced offspring survival were noted in the mallard duck, American kestrel, ring dove, and screech owl. Effects on aquatic organisms: Dicofol is highly toxic to fish, aquatic invertebrates, and algae. The LC50 is 0.12 mg/L in rainbow trout, 0.37 mg/L in sheepshead minnow, 0.06 mg/L in mysid shrimp, 0.015 mg/L in shell oysters, and 0.075 mg/L in algae. Effects on other organisms: Dicofol is not toxic to bees.  Degradation  Breakdown in soil and groundwater: Dicofol is moderately persistent in soil, with a half-life of 60 days. Dicofol is susceptible to chemical breakdown in moist soils. It is also subject to degradation by UV light. In a silty loam soil, its photodegradation half-life was 30 days. Under anaerobic soil conditions, the half-life for dicofol was 15.9 days. Dicofol is practically insoluble in water and adsorbs very strongly to soil particles. It is therefore nearly immobile in soils and unlikely to infiltrate groundwater. Even in sandy soil, dicofol was not detected below the top in standard soil column tests. It is possible for dicofol to enter surface waters when soil erosion occurs. Breakdown in water: Dicofol degrades in water or when exposed to UV light at pH levels above 7. Its half-life in solution at pH 5 is 47 to 85 days. Because of its very high absorption coefficient (Koc), dicofol is expected to adsorb to sediment when released into open waters. Breakdown in vegetation: In a number of studies, dicofol residues on treated plant tissues have been shown to remain unchanged for up to 2 years.

Nekhen () in Ancient Egyptian; in Hierakonpolis ( or Hierak≈çn polis \\"Hawk City\\",Strabo xvii. p. 817 in ) was the religious and political capital of Upper Egypt at the end of prehistoric Egypt ( 3200‚Äì3100 BC) and probably, also during the Early Dynastic Period ( 3100‚Äì2686 BC). The oldest known tomb with painted decoration, a mural on its plaster walls is located in Nekhen and is thought to date to c. 3500-3200 BC. It shares distinctive imagery with artifacts from the Gerzeh culture. Horus cult center Nekhen was the center of the cult of a hawk deity, Horus of Nekhen, which raised one of the most ancient Egyptian temples in this city. It retained its importance as the cultic center for this divine patron of the kings long after the site had otherwise declined. The first settlement at Nekhen dates from either the predynastic Amratian culture (c. 4400 BC) or, perhaps, during the late Badari culture (c. 5000 BC). At its height, from c. 3400 BC, Nekhen had at least 5,000 and possibly, as many as 10,000 inhabitants. Most of Upper Egypt then became unified under rulers from Abydos during the Naqada III period (3200-3000 BCE), at the expense of rival cities, especially Hierakonpolis. The conflicts leading to the supremacy of Abydos may appear on numerous reliefs of the Naqada II period, such as the Gebel el-Arak Knife, or the frieze of Tomb 100 at Hierakonpolis. The ruins of the city originally were excavated toward the end of the nineteenth century by the English archaeologists James Quibell and Frederick W. Green. Nekhen ivory objects Quibell and Green discovered the \\"Main Deposit\\", a foundation deposit beneath the temple, in 1894. Quibell originally was trained under Flinders Petrie, the father of modern Egyptology, however, he failed to follow Petrie's methods. The temple was a difficult site to excavate to begin with, so his excavation was poorly conducted and then, poorly documented. Specifically, the situational context of the items therein is poorly recorded and often, the reports of Quibell and Green are in contradiction. The most famous artifact commonly associated with the main deposit, the Narmer Palette, now is thought probably not to have been in the main deposit at all. Quibell's report made in 1900 put the palette in the deposit, but Green's report in 1902 put it about one to two yards away. Green's version is substantiated by earlier field notes (Quibell kept none), so it is now the accepted record of events. Human figurine from the main deposit at Nekhen, Ashmolean Museum The main deposit dates to the early Old Kingdom, but the artistic style of the objects in the deposit indicate that they were from Naqada III and were moved into the deposit at a later date. The other important item in the deposit clearly dates to the late prehistoric. This object, the Scorpion Macehead, depicts a king known only by the ideogram for scorpion, now called Scorpion II, participating in what seems to be a ritual irrigation ceremony. Although the Narmer Palette is more famous because it shows the first king to wear both the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt, the Scorpion Macehead indicates some early military hostility with the north by showing dead lapwings, the symbol of Lower Egypt, hung from standards. John Garstang excavated at Nekhen in 1905-06. He initially hoped to excavate the town site, but encountered difficulties working there, and soon turned his attention to the area he misidentified as a ‚Äòfort‚Äô instead. That site dates to the second dynasty King Khasekhemwy. Beneath that area, Garstang excavated a Predynastic cemetery consisting of 188 graves, which served the bulk of the city population during the late Predynastic and Early Dynastic periods, revealing the burial practices of the non-elite Egyptians living at Nekhen. More recently, the concession was excavated further by a multinational team of archaeologists, Egyptologists, geologists, and members of other sciences, which was coordinated by Michael Hoffman until his death in 1990, then by Barbara Adams of University College London and Dr. Renee Friedman representing the University of California, Berkeley and the British Museum, until Barbara Adams's death in 2001, and by Ren√©e Friedman thereafter.

Possible ritual structures The structure at Nekhen known by the misnomer \\"fort\\" is a massive mud-brick enclosure built by King Khasekhemwy of the Second Dynasty. It appears to be similar in structure and ritual purpose as the similarly misidentified 'forts' constructed at Abydos, all without apparent military function. The true function of these structures is unknown, but they seem to be related to the rituals of kingship and the culture. Religion was interwoven inexorably with kingship in Ancient Egypt. The ritual structure at Nekhen was built on a prehistoric cemetery. The excavations there, as well as the work of later brick robbers, have seriously undermined the walls and led to the near collapse of the structure. For two years, during 2005 and 2006, the team led by Friedman attempted to stabilize the existing structure and support the endangered areas of the structure with new mudbricks. Oldest known Egyptian painted tomb An ancient Nekhen tomb painting in plaster with barques, staffs, goddesses, and animals - possibly the earliest example of an Egyptian tomb mural Other discoveries at Nekhen include Tomb 100, the oldest known tomb with a mural painted on its plaster walls. The sepulchre is thought to date to the Gerzeh culture (c. 3500-3200 BC). It is presumed that the mural shows religious scenes and images. It includes figures featured in Egyptian culture for three thousand years--a funerary procession of barques, presumably a goddess standing between two upright lionesses, a wheel of various horned quadrupeds, several examples of a staff that became associated with the deity of the earliest cattle culture and one being held up by a heavy-breasted goddess. Animals depicted include onagers or zebras, ibexes, ostriches, lionesses, impalas, gazelles, and cattle. Several of the themes and designs visible in the Hierakonpolis frescoe can also be seen in other contemporary Egyptian works of art, such as the Gebel el-Arak Knife (c. 3500-3200 BCE), with the scene of the Master of animals, showing a man fighting against two lions, the individual fighting scenes or the boats.

In the painted tomb of Horemkhauef a biographical inscription reporting a journey to the capital by him was found. He lived during the Second Intermediate Period. Because it had a strong association with Egyptian religious ideas about kingship, the temple of Horus at Nekhen was used as late as the Ptolemaic Kingdom, persisting as a religious center throughout the thousands of years of Ancient Egyptian culture.

Her research focuses on the center of the Milky Way galaxy. In 2020, she became the fourth woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, sharing one half of the prize with Reinhard Genzel (the other half of the prize being awarded to Roger Penrose). The Nobel Prize was awarded to Ghez and Genzel for their discovery of a supermassive compact object, now generally recognized to be a black hole, in the Milky Way's galactic center. Early life Ghez was born in New York City, the daughter of Susanne (Gayton) and Gilbert Ghez. Her father, of Jewish heritage, was born in Rome, Italy, to a family originally from Tunisia and Frankfurt, Germany.http://www.mevakshederekh.info/Portals/0/Il_tempo_e_idea/HAZMAN%20VEHARAION%20-%20IL%20TEMPO%20E%20L_IDEA%20Vol%20XXV%202019%20(web).pdf Her mother was from an Irish Catholic family from North Attleborough, Massachusetts. Her family moved from New York to Chicago when she was a child, and Ghez attended the University of Chicago Lab School. The Apollo program Moon landings inspired Ghez to aspire to be the first female astronaut, and her mother encouraged that goal. Her most influential female role model was her high school chemistry teacher. She began college by majoring in mathematics, then changed to physics. She received a BS in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1987 and her Ph.D. under the direction of Gerry Neugebauer at the California Institute of Technology in 1992. Career Ghez' research employs high spatial resolution imaging techniques, such as the adaptive optics system at the Keck telescopes, to study star-forming regions and the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way known as Sagittarius A*. She uses the kinematics of stars near the center of the Milky Way as a probe to investigate this region. The high resolution of the Keck telescopes gave a significant improvement over the first major study of galactic center kinematics by Reinhard Genzel's group. In 2004, Ghez was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and in 2019, she was elected as a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS). Ghez has appeared in many television documentaries produced by networks such as the BBC, Discovery Channel, and The History Channel. In 2006 she was in an episode of the PBS series Nova. She was identified as a Science Hero by The My Hero Project. In 2000, Discover magazine listed Ghez as one of 20 promising young American scientists in their respective fields. Black hole at the Galactic Center (Sgr A*) By imaging the Galactic Center at infrared wavelengths, Ghez and her colleagues have been able to peer through heavy dust that blocks visible light, to reveal images of the center of the Milky Way. Thanks to the aperture of the W.M. Keck Telescope and the use of adaptive optics to correct for the turbulence of the atmosphere, these images of the Galactic Center are at very high spatial resolution and have made it possible to follow the orbits of stars around the black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). The partial orbits of many stars orbiting the black hole at the Galactic Center have been observed. One of the stars, S2, has made a complete elliptical orbit since detailed observations began in 1995. Several decades more will be required to completely document the orbits of some of these stars. These measurements may provide a test of the theory of general relativity. In October 2012, a second star, S0-102, was identified by her team at UCLA, orbiting the Galactic Center. Using Kepler's third law, Ghez's team used the orbital motion to show that the mass of Sgr A* is 4.1¬±0.6 million solar masses. Because the Galactic Center where Sgr A* is located, is one hundred times closer than M31 where the next nearest supermassive black hole M31* is, it is one of the best demonstrated cases for a supermassive black hole. In 2020, Ghez shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Roger Penrose and Reinhard Genzel, for their discoveries relating to black holes. Ghez and Genzel were awarded one half of the prize for their discovery that a supermassive black hole most likely governs the orbits of stars at the center of the Milky Way. Ghez was the fourth woman to win the physics Nobel since its inception, being preceded by Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert Mayer (1963), and Donna Strickland (2018). Personal life Ghez is married to Tom LaTourrette, a geologist and research scientist at the RAND corporation. They have two sons. Ghez is an active swimmer in the Masters Swim Club. Awards * Annie J.

An aerostat (From Greek ·ºÄŒÆœÅ aer (air) + œÉœÑŒ±œÑœåœÇ statos (standing) through French) is a lighter than air aircraft that gains its lift through the use of a buoyant gas. Aerostats include unpowered balloons and powered airships. A balloon may be free-flying or tethered. The average density of the craft is lower than the density of atmospheric air, because its main component is one or more gasbags, a lightweight skin containing a lifting gas (including heated air as well as gases that have a lower density than air) to provide buoyancy, to which other components such as a gondola containing equipment or people are attached. Especially with airships, the gasbags are often protected by an outer envelope. Aerostats are so named because they use aerostatic lift which is a buoyant force that does not require movement through the surrounding air mass. This contrasts with the heavy aerodynes that primarily use aerodynamic lift which requires the movement of a wing surface through the surrounding air mass. The term has also been used in a narrower sense, to refer to the statically tethered balloon in contrast to the free-flying airship. This article uses the term in its broader sense. Terminology In conventional usage, the term aerostat refers to any aircraft that remains aloft primarily using aerostatic buoyancy. Historically, all aerostats were called balloons. Powered types capable of horizontal flight were referred to as dirigible balloons or simply dirigibles (from the French dirigeable meaning steerable). These powered aerostats later came to be called airships, with the term \\"balloon\\" reserved for unpowered types, whether tethered or free-floating.Wragg, D.; Historical dictionary of aviation, History Press (2008). More recently, the US Government Accountability Office has used the term \\"aerostat\\" in a different sense, to distinguish the statically tethered balloon from the free-flying airship. Types Balloons A free-flying hot air balloon A balloon is an unpowered aerostat which has no means of propulsion and must be either tethered on a long cable or allowed to drift freely with the wind. Although a free balloon travels at the speed of the wind, it is travelling with the wind so to a passenger the air feels calm and windless. To change its altitude above ground it must either adjust the amount of lift or discard ballast weight. Notable uses of free-flying balloons include meteorological balloons and sport balloons. A tethered balloon is held down by one or more mooring lines or tethers. It has sufficient lift to hold the line taut and its altitude is controlled by winching the line in or out. A tethered balloon does feel the wind. A round balloon is unstable and bobs about in strong winds, so the kite balloon was developed with an aerodynamic shape similar to a non-rigid airship. Both kite balloons and non-rigid airships are sometimes called \\"blimps\\". Notable uses of tethered balloons include observation balloons and barrage balloons and notable uses of untethered balloons include espionage balloons and fire balloons. Airships The Goodyear blimps are non-rigid airships An airship is a powered, free-flying aerostat that can be steered. Airships divide into rigid, semi-rigid and non-rigid types, with these last often known as blimps. A rigid airship has an outer framework or skin surrounding the lifting gas bags inside it, The outer envelope keeps its shape even if the gasbags are deflated. The great zeppelin airships of the twentieth century were rigid types. A non-rigid airship or blimp deflates like a balloon as it loses gas. The Goodyear blimps are still a common sight in the USA. A semi-rigid airship has a deflatable gas bag like a non-rigid but with a supporting structure to help it hold its shape while aloft. The first practical airship, the Santos-Dumont No. 6 was a semi-rigid. Some airships obtain additional lift aerodynamically as they travel through the air, using the shape of their envelope or through the addition of fins or even small wings. Types designed to exploit this lifting effect in normal cruise are called hybrid airships. Hybrid aerostats A hybrid type uses both static buoyancy and dynamic airflow to provide lift. The dynamic movement may be created either using propulsive power as a hybrid airship or by tethering in the wind like a kite, as a Helikite or kytoon. The Allsopp Helikite is a combination of a helium balloon and a kite to form a single, aerodynamically sound tethered aircraft, that exploits both wind and helium for its lift. Helikites are semi-rigid. Helikites are considered the most stable, energy and cost-efficient aerostats available.EU FP7 ABSOLUTE Project: Aerial Platforms Study This gives Helikites various advantages over traditional aerostats. Traditional aerostats need to utilize relatively low-lift helium gas to combat high winds, which means they need to have a lot of gas to cope and so are very large, unwieldy and expensive. Helikites exploit wind lift so they only need to be a fraction of the size of traditional aerostats in order to operate in high winds. Helikites fly many times higher altitude than traditional aerostats of the same size. Being smaller, with fewer construction seams, means Helikites have minimal problems with gas leakage compared to traditional aerostats, so Helikites use far less helium. Helikites do not need ballonets and so are simpler in construction than traditional aerostats and Helikites do not need constant electrical power to keep them airborne. Helikites are also extremely stable and so are good aerial platforms for cameras or scientific instruments. Tiny Helikites will fly in all weathers, so these sizes are popular as they are very reliable but still easy to handle and do not require large expensive winches. Helikites can be small enough to fit fully inflated in a car but they can also be made large if heavy payloads are required to be flown to high altitudes. Helikites are one of the most popular aerostat designs and are widely used by the scientific community, military, photographers, geographers, police, first responders. Helikites are used by telecoms companies to lift 4G and 5G base stations for areas without cellphone coverage. Helikites range in size from 1 metre (gas volume 0.13 m3) with a pure helium lift of 30g, up to 14 metres (gas volume 250m3) able to lift 117 kg. Small Helikites can fly up to altitudes of 1,000 ft, and medium-sized Helikites up to altitudes of 13,000 ft, while large Helikites can achieve 7,000 ft. Piasecki Helicopter developed the Piasecki PA-97 Helistat using the rotor systems from four obsolete helicopters and a surplus Navy blimp, in order to provide a capability to lift heavier loads than a single helicopter could provide. The aircraft suffered a fatal accident during a test flight. In 2008, Boeing and SkyHook International resurrected the concept and announced a proposed design of the SkyHook JHL-40. Lifting gases In order to provide buoyancy, any lifting gas must be less dense than the surrounding air. A hot air balloon is open at the bottom to allow hot air to enter, while the gas balloon is closed to stop the (cold) lifting gas from escaping. Common lifting gases have included hydrogen, coal gas and helium. Hot air When heated, air expands. This lowers its density and creates lift. Small hot air balloons or lanterns have been flown in China since ancient times. The first modern man-lifting aerostat, made by the Montgolfier brothers, was a hot air balloon. Most early balloons however were gas balloons. Interest in the sport of hot air ballooning reawoke in the second half of the twentieth century and even some hot-air airships have been flown. Hydrogen Hydrogen is the lightest of all gases and a manned hydrogen balloon was flown soon after the Montgolfier brothers. There is no need to burn fuel, so a gas balloon can stay aloft far longer than a hot-air balloon. It is also safer if there is no flame on board, since the materials used to make aerostats are flammable. Hydrogen soon became the most common lifting gas for both balloons and, later, airships. But hydrogen itself is flammable and, following several major disasters in the 1930s, it fell out of use. Coal gas Coal gas comprises a mix of methane and other gases, and typically has about half the lifting power of hydrogen. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries municipal gas works became common and provided a cheap source of lifting gas. Some works were able to produce a special mix for ballooning events, incorporating a higher proportion of hydrogen and less carbon monoxide, to improve its lifting power. Helium Helium is the only lifting gas which is both non-flammable and non-toxic, and it has almost as much (about 92%) lifting power as hydrogen. It was not discovered in quantity until early in the twentieth century, and for many years only the USA had enough to use in airships. Almost all gas balloons and airships now use helium. Low pressure gases Although not currently practical, it may be possible to construct a rigid, lighter-than-air structure which, rather than being inflated with air, is at a vacuum relative to the surrounding air. This would allow the object to float above the ground without any heat or special lifting gas, but the structural challenges of building a rigid vacuum chamber lighter than air are quite significant. Even so, it may be possible to improve the performance of more conventional aerostats by trading gas weight for structural weight, combining the lifting properties of the gas with vacuum and possibly heat for enhanced lift.

He was born in Barrow-in-Furness, Lancashire, England. Following graduation from the Royal College of Science, London, in 1898, he became an assistant to Guglielmo Marconi, the Italian radio entrepreneur. In 1901 he received his doctorate from the Royal College of Science. Eccles was an advocate of Oliver Heaviside's theory that a conducting layer of the upper atmosphere could reflect radio waves around the curvature of the Earth, thus enabling their transmission over long distances. Originally known as the Kennelly‚ÄìHeaviside layer, this region of the Earth's atmosphere became known as the ionosphere. In 1912 Eccles suggested that solar radiation was responsible for the observed differences in radio wave propagation during the day and night. He carried out experiments into atmospheric disturbances of radio waves and used wave detectors and amplifiers in his work. Eccles invented the term Diode to describe an evacuated glass tube containing two electrodes; an anode and a cathode. Following World War I Eccles' main interest was in electronic circuit development. In 1918 he worked in collaboration with F. W. Jordan to patent the flip-flop circuit, which became the basis of electronic memory in computers.William Henry Eccles and Frank Wilfred Jordan, \\"Improvements in ionic relays\\" British patent number: GB 148582 (filed: 21 June 1918; published: 5 August 1920).

Many top entertainers performed at the Latin including Harry Belafonte, Jimmy Durante, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, Richard Pryor, Jerry Lewis, Milton Berle, Lena Horne, Pearl Bailey, Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton, and Joey Bishop. The Latin was a very popular Center City nightclub for a decade. In 1960, owners Stanley and Bea Carroll (of \\"Carroll‚Äôs\\"), David Dushoff, and Daniel \\"Dallas\\" Gerson relocated the nightclub to 2235 Route 70 in nearby Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and built the plush 1,500-seat, Vegas-style dinner theater renamed from the \\"Latin\\" to the \\"Latin Casino\\", although casino gambling was not included. It was considered one of the fanciest, hippest dinner nightclub experiences of that time featuring dinner, drinks and a showcase of top entertainment, and was called \\"The Showplace of the Stars\\". Following a period of strong popular success, the Latin Casino finally closed in the summer of 1978 as an indication of an end of era and a symbol of the evolution of pop culture. Five months later, at the height of the disco craze, it reopened as an exotic disco club, Emerald City. Success was short lived and it was converted to a venue for progressive rock bands and finally closed in December 1982, and was later demolished for commercial use. Background The supper club was opened in 1943 by Jack Price and Arthur Friedman. Friedman, a US Army veteran, was the key‚Äîbecause of his veteran status‚Äîto obtaining the liquor license needed to open and operate the night club. Arthur Friedman was Jack Price's nephew. He was the son of Frieda Friedman who was Jack Price's sister. The night club was then purchased by Stanley and Bea Carroll, David Dushoff and Dallas Gerson in 1951 and was originally located near Juniper and Walnut Streets in Center City, Philadelphia. Frustrated by Pennsylvania's restrictive liquor laws, conflicts with city officials, the desire for more parking space, and outgrowing its small size, the two owners decided to move across the Delaware River five miles to Delaware Township, New Jersey (soon to be renamed Cherry Hill) in 1960. The new Latin was four times as large and located diagonally across the highway from the Seashore Line tracks and Garden State Park. Some of the first acts who played The Latin were Patti Page, comedian Sammy Shore, and Johnny Mathis. \\"The Latin\\" was a famous showroom for showcasing entertainers like Cherry Hill Estates neighbors Bobby Darin, Al Martino, and Frankie Avalon (whose family had ownership interests in a popular pizzeria \\"King of Pizza\\" diagonally across Route 70). Stars that appeared on stage and frequented the area were Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, Richard Pryor (who recorded his 1975 album ...Is It Something I Said? there), Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Pat Cooper, The Temptations, The Supremes, Liza Minnelli, Tom Jones, Donna Summer, B.B.

In New York, Washington Post, May 27, 1951, pg. B9. Fran Warren, Danny Thomas, and Engelbert Humperdinck. Philadelphia-native Bob Saget in 2017 talked about trying to sneak-in to the Latin Casino to see Don Rickles perform. He was arrested. There were several celebrity incidents that drew media attention. On September 29, 1975, Jackie Wilson suffered a massive heart attack while playing a Dick Clark show, falling head-first to the stage. He was singing his hit \\"Lonely Teardrops\\" and was stricken just after the line \\"My heart is crying, crying.\\" Wilson became comatose and was taken to Cherry Hill Hospital; he lived in a nursing home until his death at age 49. Brenda Lee broke her neck onstage during a June 12, 1962, performance, and eventually recovered in time to graduate high school. Tom Jones was also once jumped outside the back door following one of his performances by two fanatical Italian women going by the name Canni. Mr. Jones was not hurt but the ladies were banned from 'The Latin' and from any Tom Jones performance. The celebrities and orchestra players performing at nightclub often drank at the neighboring Rickshaw Inn lobby bar. In 1978, with nightclubs in a general state of decline and competition from casinos in Atlantic City imminent, the Latin Casino was converted to a disco called Emerald City that boasted a neon light show over the dance floor that cost in excess of one million dollars. After a couple years Emerald City shifted from disco to rock club, hosting major and up-and-coming acts of the time such as The Rolling Stones, James Brown & The Famous Flames (who recorded their 1967 album, Live at The Garden, there), Aerosmith, The Ramones, Ultravox, Talking Heads, Elvis Costello, Alice Cooper, Madonna, The B-52's, The Go-Go's, Squeeze, Joan Jett, Dire Straits, The Romantics, UB40, Joe Jackson, Cyndi Lauper, The Psychedelic Furs, George Thorogood & the Destroyers, Blue √ñyster Cult, and Prince on his debut tour. The Cure played their first ever American show at this venue on April 10, 1980. It was torn down in the mid-1980s after a fire. The headquarters of Subaru of America was then built on the site, opening in 1986. Upon Subaru moving their headquarters to Camden in 2018, their former headquarters were demolished throughout May 2019. In November 2019, the club was recreated for the setting of a scene in Martin Scorsese's ‚ÄúThe Irishman‚Äù The menu The menu reflected the Pop culture choices of the 1960s. The artwork for the menu cover was an ink drawing of the exterior facade on a background of drink glasses, music notes, and star like asterisks.

It lies to the west of the centre of Reading, and extends from the River Thames in the north to the A4 road in the south. The suburb is partly within the boundaries of the Borough of Reading and partly in the district of West Berkshire. The part within West Berkshire forms part of the civil parish of Tilehurst, which also includes the northern part of Calcot and a small rural area west of the suburb. The part within the Borough of Reading includes the Reading electoral ward of Tilehurst, together with parts of Kentwood and Norcot wards.  History  Tilehurst was first recorded in 1291, when it was listed as a hamlet of Reading in Pope Nicholas III's taxation. At this time, the settlement was under the ownership of Reading Abbey, where it stayed until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Tilehurst became an extensive parish, which included the tything of Theale as well as the manors of Tilehurst, Kentwood, Pincents and Beansheaf. In 1545, Henry VIII granted the manor of Tilehurst to Francis Englefield, who held it until his attainder (and forfeiture of the manor) in 1586. The following year, Elizabeth I gave the manor to Henry Forster of Aldermaston and George Fitton. Forster and Fitton possessed the manor until the turn of the century, when Elizabeth sold it to Henry Best and Francis Jackson. Over the space of five years, the manor passed from Best and Jackson to the son of Sir Thomas Crompton, then on to Dutch merchant Peter Vanlore. Vanlore built a manor house on the estate‚ÄîCalcot Park. Throughout the 17th century the manor passed through the Vanlore family to the Dickenson family, before being purchased in 1687 by the Wilder family of Nunhide (builders of Wilder's Folly) for ¬£1,075. Page and Ditchfield write that in the early 18th century the manor was also owned by the family of John Kendrick, albeit for a short period. The manor subsequently passed to Benjamin Child, who married Mary Kendrick, heir of the Kendrick family. After Kendrick's death, Childs sold the manor to descendants of John Blagrave in 1759. The Blagrave family built the present-day Calcot House, which‚Äîaccording to one story‚Äîwas made necessary by Child's eviction. After Child sold the estate to the Blagraves, he was reluctant to leave the house. The Blagraves were forced to remove the building's roof to \\"flush\\" him out of the building, thereby requiring a new building to replace the uninhabitable original house. The manor was retained by the Blagrave family until the 1920s, after which it served as the clubhouse for the estate's golf course and was later converted into apartments. The Tilehurst Water Tower was built in the 1930s to provide water at pressure to the growing village population The manor of Kentwood was owned by Peter Vanlore, before passing through the Kentwood family (taking their name from the manor itself), the Swafield family, the Yate family, the Fettiplace family and the Dunch family. In 1719, the manor was divided between heirs. The manor of Pincents was named after the local Pincent family. Originally from Sulhamstead, the family owned the manor until the end of the 15th century. After this it was owned by the Sambourne family before they sold it to the Windsor family. In 1598 the manor was sold to the Blagrave family; its succession through the family is identical to that of Calcot Park. In the 1920s the manor was sold off and later became a wedding and conference venue. The manor of Beansheaf took its name from a 13th-century Tilehurst family. In 1316 John Beansheaf granted some of the manor's land to John Stonor. While it is not recorded how much was granted, it is likely that Stonor inherited the entire estate as the Beansheaf name did not appear in subsequent records. In 1390, Ralf Stonor gave the manor to William Sutton of Campden and John Frank. Frank later returned his share of the manor to Ralf Stonor, after which the manor was retained by the Stonor family until the end of the 15th century. The manor left the Stonor family when John Stonor died with no heirs. It passed through his sister, Anne, to her husband‚ÄîAdrian Fortescue. Some of the manor was later reinherited by the Stonors, though the majority was retained by the Fortescues until passing through marriage to the Wentworth family. In 1562 the manor was bought by John Bolney and Ambrose Dormer, after which it was passed into the family of Tanfield Vachell. The manor was inherited by the Blagrave family some time after 1600. Throughout the 19th century, a number of changes came to Tilehurst. A national school was founded in 1819 to provide education to children not in private schooling. Theale became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1832, and a separate civil parish in 1894.Vision of Britain website The Great Western main line was built through Berkshire in 1841; Tilehurst's railway station opened in 1882. By 1887, the boundaries of Reading included parts of Tilehurst. In 1889 a large part of the parish was transferred to Reading, and further areas were transferred to the borough of Reading in 1911. In the 1920s and 30s, many new houses‚Äîparticularly semi-detached residences‚Äîwere built in Tilehurst. This gave the need for improved utilities; electricity arrived in the 1920s (replacing the gas that fuelled the area from 1906) and a new water tower was built in 1932. After World War II, Tilehurst‚Äîlike many other settlements‚Äîwas in need of new housing; from 1950 many houses and estates were built in the area. In the mid-1960s a prominent Victorian character property, Westwood House with some 5 acres of open grounds was demolished as part of the ever pressing need for new housing. This site was positioned between Westwood Road and Pierce's Hill and had served well as a venue for occasional local social events.  Toponymy  The name Tilehurst comes from the Old English \\"tigel\\" meaning \\"tile\\" and \\"hurst\\" meaning \\"wooded hill\\". Alternative spellings have included Tygelhurst (13th century), Tyghelhurst (14th century), and Tylehurst (16th century). The present spelling became commonplace in the 18th century.  Governance  Tilehurst is divided between the civil parish of Tilehurst in the district of West Berkshire and the electoral wards of Tilehurst and Kentwood (where Tilehurst railway station is located) in the unitary authority of Reading. Education governance in Tilehurst is split between West Berkshire Council and Reading Borough Council as their boundaries run through the suburb. The parish is split between four churches‚Äîthose of St Catherine, St George, St Mary Magdalen and St Michael.  Geography  The River Thames near to Tilehurst. Appletree Eyot can be seen in the distance. Tilehurst is situated on a hill (approximately AMSL), to the west of Reading. The land is steep to the west and south of the village; the gradient is smoother north (towards the River Thames) and east (descending towards Reading). Much of Tilehurst was enclosed common land during the 18th and 19th centuries; as this land was developed with housing the commons were lost. Arthur Newbery Park is a surviving area of commonland. Similarly, Prospect Park was enclosed and established before major development of the area was undertaken. Tilehurst is bordered to the west by wood and farmland, to the north by other settlements (such as Purley on Thames and the river itself), to the east by Reading, and to the south by the Reading to Taunton line, the M4 motorway and the River Kennet. Tilehurst is centred around Tilehurst Triangle (known locally as \\"the village\\"), a pedestrianised area providing shopping, leisure and educational facilities. Other areas of Tilehurst include Kentwood near the railway station in the north, Norcot in the east, Churchend around St Michael's parish church in the south, and Little Heath in the west. Tilehurst has a site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) just to the west of the village, called Sulham and Tidmarsh Woods and Meadows.Magic Map Application Tilehurst has four local nature reserves called Blundells Copse, Lousehill Copse, McIlroy Park & Round Copse.  Demography   Tilehurst ward (Reading)  The 2011 census recorded 9,155 residents in the ward and an area of .  Tilehurst parish (West Berkshire)  In the 2001 census there were 14,683 residents of the parish.  Economy  Until the late 19th century, the majority of working men in Tilehurst were employed in farming or similar agricultural work. The main industry associated with Tilehurst, however, was the manufacture of tiles. This industry present in the district until recent times; the 1881 UK census listed a number of men as being employed as brickmen in kilns in the area. Written evidence of brickwork can be traced to the 1600s, but with the peak of production at around 1885. Kilns were established at Grovelands and Kentwood‚Äîboth to the east of the settlement‚Äîwith clay pits being dug on Norcot Hill in an area now known as The Potteries. An overhead cable was used to transport the clay-filled buckets between the pits and the kiln across Norcot Road; this was shown on a 1942 map of the area as an \\"aerial cable\\" running from the clay pit in Kentwood to Grovelands works approximately away.Pre-WWII ‚Äì BERKSHIRE 1932‚Äì1936 (1:2,500) The cable was also included on the 1940s Ordnance Survey New Popular Edition maps, labelled as an \\"aerial ropeway\\".OS NPO (Eng/Wales) 1945‚Äì1955 (1:50,000) An 1883 Ordnance Survey map of Berkshire shows a number of kilns in the Grovelands area (on the present-day Colliers Way estate) and one in Norcot near the present-day Lawrence Road. The latter was more specifically named in the 1899 Pre-WWII 1:2,500 scale Berkshire map as \\"Norcot Kiln, Brick and Tile Works\\". By the 1920s, Tilehurst Potteries had been formally established at Kew Kiln on Kentwood Hill. By the 1960s, clay business had waned and the pits were closed in 1967.  Architecture  Late 20th-century housing estate The architecture of Tilehurst ranges from 19th century thatched cottages to late 20th-century housing estates. Victorian and Edwardian terraces (built using bricks from the Tilehurst kilns) are common in the area; streets such as Blundells Road and Norcot Road display this type of architecture. As the area expanded, a huge number of semi-detached dwellings were built in the mid-20th century, in areas such as St Michael's Road (1930s) and on the Berkshire Drive estate (1950s). Examples of unique architecture in Tilehurst include two water towers: Tilehurst Water Tower‚Äîa 1932 concrete building, open octagonal in design with arcading supporting a cylindrical drum, and Norcot Water Tower‚Äîan 1890s brick building with tiered blind arcading. The Mansion House in Prospect Park (19th century) is a regency mansion built in Portland stone. The north and south faces feature Doric and Ionic order porticos respectively.  Culture  Tilehurst has a horticultural society which holds a produce show annually in August. The village has few establishments for performing arts, as most are provided in Reading. An amateur dramatics society, the Triangle Players, is based in the village. A branch of the Allenova School of Dancing is also situated in Tilehurst. Tilehurst Square Dance Club draws dancers from Reading and beyond and has been operating since 1989.  Transport  Tilehurst railway station Tilehurst railway station is located at the northern edge of Tilehurst. It has regular Great Western Railway services between Reading and Oxford on the Great Western Main Line, and commuter services to London Paddington. Journey times are approximately five minutes to Reading and 35 minutes to Oxford. Connections to the south and south-west via the Reading to Taunton Line and the Reading to Basingstoke Line are made by services changing at Reading. Reading Buses services 15, 15a, 16, 17, 28, 33, serve Tilehurst, connecting the village to Reading, Purley and Pangbourne. Tilehurst is bordered by two major roads‚Äîto the north by the A329 (connecting the village to Reading and Pangbourne), and to the south by the A4 (connecting the village to Reading and Theale). Non-arterial roads in Tilehurst saw a great improvement in the 1940s with the introduction of trolleybuses in Reading.  Education  Tilehurst is served by two comprehensive secondary schools‚ÄîDenefield School and Little Heath School. The catchment areas of Prospect School and Theale Green Community School also cover parts of Tilehurst. Tilehurst is served by Brookfields School, a special school catering for students with moderate, severe or profound and multiple learning difficulties. Primary education in Tilehurst includes Birch Copse Primary School, Downsway Primary School, Long Lane Primary School, English Martyrs' Catholic Primary School, Moorlands Primary School, Park Lane Primary School, Ranikhet Primary School, St Michael's Primary School, St Paul's Catholic Primary School, Springfield Primary School, Meadow Park Academy, Westwood Farm Infant School, and Westwood Farm Junior School.  Places of worship  Church of St Michael Tilehurst has a number of religious buildings covering numerous denominations. The Church of St Michael, situated centrally in the parish, is a brick church with a square tower. Parts of the building date from the 13th century, replacing an earlier church thought to have been built in 1189. Sir Peter Vanlore is buried in the church's Lady chapel. The Anglican church of St Catherine of Siena was built in the Little Heath area of Tilehurst from 1962 to 1964. A Methodist church is near the village centre, and a Latter-day Saints church opened in Tilehurst in the 1970s. The Roman Catholic church of St Joseph was built in Park Lane from 1955‚Äì56. Tilehurst also has a United Reformed Church (built on the site of an early 19th-century Congregational Chapel), a Bethel United Church, and Anglican churches dedicated to St George and St Mary Magdalen. Tilehurst does not have any synagogues, mosques or gurdwaras. The nearest are in West Reading, central Reading and East Reading respectively.  Sport  Tilehurst has been represented in numerous sports for over a century. Tilehurst Cricket Club existed from at least 1883. The club originally played on Church End Lane. While the exact location of the ground is unknown, it is likely that it was on a recreation ground behind the present-day Moorlands School. Victoria Recreation Ground was established in 1897, and the cricket club began using the new park as their ground at some point after this. The club joined the Reading and District Cricket League in 1900; the Reading Chronicle reported on the club's first game‚Äîa loss to nearby Grovelands CC‚Äîby saying \\"Tilehurst were but poorly represented, several of their best players not having signed the required fourteen days, and they had to play ten men only\\". Tilehurst joined the newly formed Hampshire League in 1973, proving successful in their first two seasons. Between 1991 and 1996, Tilehurst played in the Berkshire League. The following year, Tilehurst CC merged with Theale CC to form Theale and Tilehurst Cricket Club. The reason for the merger is attributed to Theale's lack of players but good facilities, and Tilehurst's surplus of players but lack of facilities. The club now play at Englefield Road, Theale, in the Thames Valley Cricket League. Tilehurst is represented by three football teams Barton Rovers, Tilehurst Panthersand Westwood Wanderers. Barton Rovers, established in 1982, are based at Turnham's Farm, Little Heath. Tilehurst Panthers, established in 2006, are a ladies team based at Denefield School and the Cotswold Sports Centre in Tilehurst.https://www.getreading.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/womens- football-reading-fran-kirby-9565966 Westwood Wanderers were established in 1972 and are a men's team based at the Cotswold Sports Centre. The team play their home matches at Denefield School. Reading Racers were based at Reading Greyhound Stadium from 1968 until the stadium's demolition in 1975. The team then moved to Smallmead Stadium, south of Reading.

In its passage through British Columbia its name is spelled Pend-d'Oreille River. It drains a scenic area of the Rocky Mountains along the U.S.-Canada border on the east side of the Columbia. The river is sometimes defined as the lower part of the Clark Fork, which rises in western Montana. The river drains an area of , mostly through the Clark Fork and its tributaries in western Montana and including a portion of the Flathead River in southeastern British Columbia. The full drainage basin of the river and its tributaries accounts for 43% of the entire Columbia River Basin above the confluence with the Columbia.Water Quality Assessment of Pend d'Oreille River at Waneta, Ministry of Environment, Canada The total area of the Pend Oreille basin is just under 10% of the entire Columbia Basin. Box Canyon Dam is currently underway on a multimillion-dollar project for a fish ladder. Course The Pend Oreille River begins at Lake Pend Oreille in Bonner County, Idaho in the Idaho Panhandle, draining the lake from its western end near Sandpoint (The Clark Fork River enters the lake from its eastern end). It flows west, receiving the Priest River from the north at the town of Priest River, then flows into southern Pend Oreille County in northeastern Washington at Newport. Once in Washington it turns north, flowing along the eastern side of the Selkirk Mountains. It flows roughly parallel to the Idaho border for approximately , through the Colville National Forest, past Tiger and Metaline Falls. It crosses the international border into southeastern British Columbia, looping west for about and joining the Columbia from the east, approximately north of the international border and approximately south of Montrose. Watershed Spreading across , the Pend Oreille River watershed stretches across most of western Montana, northern Idaho and northeastern Washington, as well as tiny portions in southern British Columbia drained by the North Fork Flathead River and the lower Pend Oreille River. Much of the southern drainage divide of the watershed forms the border of Idaho and Montana, and a very short portion of the northeastern divide forms the border of British Columbia and Alberta. The river is sometimes considered as one with the Clark Fork, which is the primary river flowing into Lake Pend Oreille. For example, in Stewart Holbrook's book The Columbia, he repeatedly refers to the Pend Oreille River as the Clark Fork. If the lengths of the North Fork Flathead, main Flathead, Clark Fork and Pend Oreille are added together, the total is over stretching from the Rocky Mountains north of Glacier National Park to the Canada-U.S. border south of Montrose, British Columbia. This makes the Pend Oreille system the second longest tributary of the Columbia River (after the Snake River). It is the fourth largest by discharge (after the Snake, Kootenay and Willamette Rivers) and drains the second largest area (second only to the Snake). The Pend Oreille River watershed divide is formed on the east side by the Continental Divide. On the south, the Spokane River and Snake River drainage basins border on the Clark Fork. To the west smaller rivers such as the Colville River and tributaries of the Spokane drain the lands past the watershed divide. In the north is the Kootenay River, a similar-sized tributary of the Columbia. To the east, in Montana, is the Missouri River and tributaries such as the Marias River and Milk River. In the southwest the watershed borders on the Big Hole River and Jefferson River, headwater streams of the Missouri. The Pend Oreille/Clark Fork system is notable in that it cuts right between the Bitterroot Range and Selkirk Range, two major chains of the Rocky Mountains. The only other river to do so is the Kootenay, just to the north. The Rocky Mountain Trench runs across the northeast part of the watershed, through the Flathead Valley, and eventually terminating in mountains near the Clark Fork's confluence with the Flathead. Tributaries The Pend Oreille River starts in northern Idaho, at Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho's largest lake. Cocolalla Creek is the first major tributary. The next one is the Priest River, this is 68 miles long, and has three rivers flowing into it. Sullivan Creek is the last big tributary. The Clark Fork is also considered a tributary, as is the Pack. Geology PeeWee Falls and the Pend Oreille River near Boundary Dam Much of the Pend Oreille valley consists of relatively ancient metamorphic rock, uplifted over 500 million years ago from the former floor of the Precambrian sea that covered the region during that period. Granite batholiths overlain by layers of sedimentary rock compose most of the higher terrain, such as the Cabinet Mountains. The age of the rocks along the Pend Oreille generally decreases as one travels downstream (north), and the terrain is also more rugged towards the north than in the south. About 200 million years ago, increased tectonic activity caused the uplift of the Idaho Batholith, a portion of which cooled and eroded to become the present main body of the Bitterroot Range, a major physiographic feature of the watershed which sweeps from northwest to southeast along the entire Clark Fork valley (and the border of Idaho and Montana), by about 70 million years ago. This time period is generally accepted as when the entire Rocky Mountains system was formed, although age of the rocks varies with location. In the previous Ice Age, a massive glacier of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet advanced southwards through the Idaho Panhandle, burying the Lake Pend Oreille and upper Pend Oreille River valley with ice hundreds to thousands of feet thick. This formed a pair of ice dams, one gigantic, and one significantly smaller. The one that caused the water of the Clark Fork and other smaller streams to back up into Glacial Lake Missoula, which stretched over two hundred miles southwest across western Montana, containing some of water, was over high. The second one blocked the upper Pend Oreille River near Sandpoint, creating an enlarged Lake Pend Oreille that could have connected with a similarly enlarged Kootenay Lake in the north. Water pressure and glacial melt destroyed the larger of the two ice dams several times, causing massive amounts of water to rush out across eastern Washington through the upper Pend Oreille River. A mistaken belief is that these cataclysmic floods, known as the Missoula Floods, traveled down the Pend Oreille Valley into the Columbia. Rather, it is now thought that the water completely breached the western divide of the Pend Oreille River valley and rushed out towards the direction of Spokane. History Native people who lived along the river included the Pend d'Oreilles and Kalispel (considered as a single tribe by the Bureau of Indian Affairs). Archaeological evidence suggests that people lived in the region as early as the end of the last Ice Age, about 11,000-12,000 years ago. The name Pend d'Oreille or Pend Oreille is variously stated to mean \\"earring\\", \\"hang from ears\\", or \\"shape of an ear\\". Kalispel is thought to mean \\"camas people\\", referring to the roots that provided their primary food. Both tribes lived around the area of Lake Pend Oreille occasionally ranging lower onto the Pend Oreille River (or maybe they did have settlements along the river?) but the lower (north) basin was generally less populated than the upper (south) portion. The Flathead tribe inhabited the upper (Clark Fork) part of the basin, especially the Bitterroot Valley. The Ktunaxa lived just to the east of the Pend Oreille river. The first non-indigenous people to see the Pend Oreille were French-Canadian fur trappers working for various fur trading companies to provide beaver pelts to trade overseas. Some of these people were the ones to coin the term \\"Pend d'Oreille\\". Canadian explorer David Thompson saw the river in 1807, after a long and arduous journey from Saskatchewan. His primary mission was to find the source of the Columbia River (Columbia Lake), which he did. Afterwards he proceeded to establish trading posts throughout the region, including Kullyspell House on the north shore of Lake Pend Oreille. In 1808, Thompson again traveled into the Pend Oreille region. The following spring, he tried to reach the Columbia River by way of the Pend Oreille, but rapids and waterfalls hampered his attempt. He ended up retreating to another trading post in British Columbia a few months later.Holbrook, p. 43 After these early explorations, however, there still were no permanent white settlements along the Pend Oreille River. The Pend Oreille River at the town of Metaline Falls By the 1840s, Europeans and Americans were pouring into the region in increasing numbers, although growth was slow. These newcomers did not strike good relations with the Native Americans of the area, and diseases such as smallpox wiped out many indigenous (this happened with many other tribes across North and Middle America as they were not used to such a sickness). After numerous wars and treaties, much of the land in the Pend Oreille basin especially the upper Clark Fork area had been ceded to the settlers. The last land in the Bitterroot area was given up in 1889, and many tribes of the Pend Oreille basin were moved to reservations in northwestern Montana. In the late 1850s, a major influx of non-indigenous peoples occurred when gold was discovered near Metaline Falls on the Pend Oreille River. The first major white settlements in that area, however, were not created until 1884. Mining for gold soon ceased but lead and zinc mining continued, reaching a peak in World War II when the metals were desperately needed for the productions of weapons, ships and planes. In the 19th century, logging was the other major industry of the Pend Oreille River area, and attracted hundreds to thousands of men to the region, many of them Scandinavian. Logging was profitable because almost the entire Pend Oreille watershed was forested with various types of trees. However, shipping logs to ports lower on the Columbia River (to the southwest of the Pend Oreille River) was a problem. Not only was the river riddled with frightening waterfalls and rapids, but it flows north, in the opposite direction that the logging companies wanted to move their logs. At about this time, steamboats were introduced to the Pend Oreille River. The first steamboat on the river was The Bertha, built in 1887 at Albeni Falls. Other well-known craft included Ione, Spokane, and Metaline (Pend Oreille). These boats carried passengers and ore and also towed log rafts up the river. (Since it flows north, they had to tow the logs south, against the current, to ship it a shorter distance to the lumber mills and factories lower in the Columbia Basin.) Navigation on the Pend Oreille presented few problems upstream of the Box Canyon rapids about three-fourths of the way down the Pend Oreille River (today close to the site of Box Canyon Dam). Many boats were wrecked in the stretch between Box Canyon and the river's mouth (including Metaline, which was the only large steamer to operate on the lower river on a regular basis). After the Idaho & Washington Northern Railroad was built in the area, steamboat commerce faded and the logs were transported by rail. The Idaho & Washington Northern was eventually succeeded by the Milwaukee Road. The Pend Oreille River valley was never easy for early or later emigrants to settle in. The little arable land that did exist was mostly within the river's floodplain, and in many places there was only a narrow strip of flat ground that would soon run against vertical cliffs or dense forests with rocky soil. Nevertheless, some permanent settlements persisted, at Newport, Albeni Falls, Ione, Dalkena, Metaline Falls, Cusick, Usk, and many at the sites of the sawmills that cut the lumber extracted from the region. Some emigrants also settled along the Clark Fork, but there were similar problems because for most of its course, the Clark Fork, like the Pend Oreille, flows in a steep and narrow gorge. Larger numbers of people settled in the Flathead River valley, around Flathead Lake and Lake Pend Oreille, in the Priest River valley, and in the Bitterroot Valley of south-western Montana. Sandpoint (population 7,000), near where the river flows out of Lake Pend Oreille, remains the largest city in close proximity to the river. River modifications Map showing dams in the Pend Oreille River watershed (Clark Fork-Lake Pend Oreille-Pend Oreille system highlighted in blue) There are five hydroelectric dams on the Pend Oreille River: Waneta (owned by Teck Cominco) and Seven Mile (B.C. Hydro) dams in Canada, Boundary (Seattle City Light), Box Canyon, (Pend Oreille County PUD), and Albeni Falls (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) dams in the United States. The combined generating capacity of all the dams is approximately 2480 megawatts (MW). Boundary Dam has the largest generating capacity of the five, at 1070 MW. The smaller Albeni Falls Dam regulates the level of Lake Pend Oreille to provide some flood control during the summer and increased flows during dry winters. None of the dams provide for fish passage or navigation. Numerous dams upstream along the Clark Fork (Cabinet Gorge, Noxon Rapids and Thompson Falls) and Flathead (Kerr/Flathead Lake and Hungry Horse) also generate power and to a lesser extent regulate the inflows to Lake Pend Oreille and the Pend Oreille River. In the 1920s, there was a proposal to divert the Pend Oreille through a gravity canal to irrigate the Grand Coulee and surrounding lands in eastern Washington as part of the tentative Columbia Basin Project. These plans were later dropped with the construction of Grand Coulee Dam and a pumping plant on the Columbia River. Names Variant names, according to the USGS, include: Bitter Root River, Bitterroot River, Clark Fork, Clarke Fork, Clarkes Fork, Clarks Fork, Deer Lodge River, Hell Gate River, Missoula River, Pend d'Oreille River, Silver Bow River, Clark's Fork, and Pend-d'Oreille River. Conservation *The Lake Pend Oreille, Pend Oreille River, Priest Lake and Priest River Commission otherwise known as the ‚ÄúLakes Commission‚Äù formed to oversee any issues relating to water quality and/or water quantity in Lake Pend Oreille, Pend Oreille River, Priest Lake and Priest River Basin. As mitigation (mandated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee ‚ÄòFERC‚Äô) for the continued license/operation of the Boundary Dam on the Pend Oreille, Seattle City and Light had to provide mitigation funding. This mitigation funding came in the form of removing the 50 foot high ‚ÄòMill Pond Dam‚Äô on Sullivan Creek just upstream of the town of Metaline Falls. Mill Pond Dam was removed in the summer of 2017 and the project finished in 2018 with stream and bank stabilization and native tree plantings. Sullivan Creek now runs free from its headwaters in the Salmon- Priest Wilderness to the Pend Oreille River. Native trout species will assuredly benefit by this habitat restoration.https://www.millponddam.com See also * List of tributaries of the Columbia River * List of rivers of Washington * List of rivers of British Columbia * List of rivers of Idaho * List of longest streams of Idaho References Books * External links Rivers of British Columbia Rivers of Idaho Rivers of Washington (state) Tributaries of the Columbia River Rivers of Bonner County, Idaho Rivers of Pend Oreille County, Washington Regional District of Central Kootenay Regional District of East Kootenay West Kootenay International rivers of North America ","title":"Pend Oreille River"},{"id":"704327","text":"Blera is a small town and comune in the northern Lazio region of Italy. It was known during the Middle Ages as Bieda, an evolved form of its ancient name, which was restored in the twentieth century. It is the birthplace of Pope Sabinian; Pope Paschal II was also originally thought to be from here. It is situated on a long, narrow tongue of rock at the junction of two deep glens. This cites History In ancient times, Blera was an Etruscan town on the Via Clodia. It was of little importance, and is known to be mentioned only by geographers and in inscriptions. In 772, it was destroyed by the Lombards of King Desiderius. In the thirteenth-fifteenth centuries, it belonged to the Di Vico family. In 1247 the army of Frederick II ravaged it. In the fifteenth century, Pope Boniface IX gave Blera to the Anguillara family, who owned it until 1572, apart from a short period from 1465 under direct Papal control. Later it followed the history of the Papal States. Main sights Some remains of the town walls still exist, and also two ancient bridges, both belonging to the Via Clodia, and many tombs hewn in the rock with small chambers imitating the architectural forms of houses, and beams and rafters represented in relief. Selvasecca di Blera Eric Berggren and the Swedish Institute in Rome excavated a Republican period rural structure or villa at the site of Selvasecca di Blera between 1965 and 1967, with preliminary results published in 1969.E.

There is also evidence that architectural terracottas were produced at the site. The implications of the villa itself have been recently re-visited.

Opened for business in 1958, it quickly became a landmark on the Central Coast of California. It was created by Alex Madonna, a successful construction magnate and entrepreneur (d. April 2004), and his wife Phyllis. The inn includes a restaurant and bakery, and is located on the west side of US Route 101 and situated on the lower eastern portion of Cerro San Luis Obispo. Description The property is adorned with a pseudo-Swiss-Alps exterior and lavish common rooms accented by pink roses, Western murals, and hammered copper. The predominant exterior color is pink, which extends to the lamp posts and trash cans. Each of the 110 guest rooms and suites is uniquely designed and themed, though some tourists stop just to peek at the famous rock waterfall urinal located in the men's restroom, a feature designed by Hollywood set designer Harvey Allen Warren. The boulders used for the Inn weigh up to for the exterior and for the interior. A boulder is shared as a fireplace for the adjoining Madonna (#141) and Old World (#192) suites. In 1973, there were five buildings on the site: {class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;\\" +Buildings at Madonna Inn ! Name !! class=\\"unsortable\\"  Image !!

Some rooms are grouped in themes. For example, the rooms \\"Ren\\" (#167), \\"Dez\\" (#168), and \\"Vous\\" (#169) are a play on the French word rendezvous, and \\"Merry\\" (#164), \\"Go\\" (#165), and \\"Round\\" (#166), for an amusement park carousel. Most of the themes were conceived by Alex and Phyllis Madonna, and some rooms were designed by Disney artist Alice Turney Williams.  History  The Madonna Inn opened as a motel inn on December 24, 1958 upon the completion of its first twelve rooms. The Madonnas were so excited to have their first guest, they refunded his $7 room rental. Demand was sufficient to expand to forty rooms in 1959, and the Inn facility was constructed in 1960. Reportedly, when the architect Richard Neutra stayed at the Inn, he asked Alex Madonna about the design: \\"Alex, you didn't have an architect here, did you? It's just as well you didn't because you couldn't have captured all the details if you had to draw them out. I don't know how you would draw these things and then accomplish them.\\" In May 1966, the Inn's original units were burned to the ground in a fire. It reopened a year later, and by the end of the decade, all of the rooms had been rebuilt in manner for which they are known today. There are 110 rooms. In 1975, critic Paul Goldberger wrote an article about the Madonna Inn for The New York Times, bringing it to national prominence. Alternate link to republished article By 1982, the Madonna Inn was already well-known, and Alex Madonna was quoted as saying, \\"Anybody can build one room and a thousand like it. It's more economical. Most places try to give you as little as possible. I try to give people a decent place to stay where they receive more than they are entitled to for what they're paying. I want people to come in with a smile and leave with a smile. It's fun.\\" Hanna-Barbera Productions sued the Madonna Inn in 1983, alleging copyright infringement over the Inn's \\"Flintstone Room\\" (#139) and its decorations, which included images of Fred and Wilma Flintstone and the exclamation \\"Yabba Dabba Doo\\". Room #139 is now the \\"Jungle Rock\\" junior suite. According to a 2013 interview with Clint Pearce, president of Madonna Enterprises, the \\"Caveman Room\\" (#137) was originally the \\"Flintstone Room\\". In popular culture Film * The \\"Rigoletto\\" segment of the movie Aria (1987) was shot around the hotel. Television * A 1994 episode of The Simpsons entitled \\"Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy\\" features a hotel based on the Madonna Inn, which, among other similarities, also contains a Caveman Room. * In the season 14 episode of ABC's reality series The Bachelor that aired on January 25, 2010, pilot Jake Pavelka and the nine remaining women take a road trip up the California coast, visit the Oceano Dunes, and stay overnight at the Madonna Inn. * In the season 5 episode of The Girls Next Door, \\"Happy Birthday, Anastasia\\", the girls take a road trip to the Madonna Inn.

Spanish in Peru, whose quelling resulted in his death.Kendall W. Brown, \\"T√∫pac Amaru (Jos√© Gabriel Condorcanqui)\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 5, p. 279. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. He later became a mythical figure in the Peruvian struggle for independence and indigenous rights movement, as well as an inspiration to myriad causes in Spanish America and beyond. Early life T√∫pac Amaru II was born Jos√© Gabriel Condorcanqui Noguera between March 8 and 24, 1738 in Surimana, Tungasuca, in the province of Cusco, to Miguel Condorcanqui Usquionsa Tupac Amaru, kuraka of three towns in the Tinta district, and Mar√≠a Rosa Noguera. On May 1, T√∫pac Amaru II was baptized by Santiago Jos√© Lopez in a church in Tungasuca. Prior to his father's death, Amaru II spent his childhood in the Vilcamayu Valley; he accompanied his father to community functions, such as the temple, the market, and processions. Tupac's parents died when he was twelve years old, and he was raised by an aunt and uncle. At age sixteen, he received a Jesuit education at the San Francisco de Borja School, founded to educate the sons of kurakas. The Jesuits \\"impressed upon him his social standing as future kuraka and someone of royal Inca blood.\\"Charles F. Walker, The Tupac Amaru Rebellion. Cambridge MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press 2014, p. 18. At age twenty-two, T√∫pac Amaru II married Micaela Bastidas. Shortly after his marriage, Amaru II succeeded his father as kuraka, giving him rights to land. As with his father, he was both the head of several Quechua communities and a regional merchant and muleteer, inheriting 350 mules from his father's estate. His regional trading gave him contacts in many other indigenous communities and access to information about economic conditions. His personal contacts and knowledge of the region were useful in the rebellion of 1780‚Äì81.Walker, The Tupac Amaru Rebellion, p. 19. His status in the colonial Spanish racial hierarchy has been discussed by scholars, whether he was of \\"pure indigenous blood\\" or a mixed-race mestizo, although his mother most likely had partial Spanish ancestry. He was recognized as an elite Quechua from a kuraka family and was educated at a school in Cuzco for sons of indigenous leaders. He spoke Quechua and Spanish, and learned Latin from the Jesuits. He was upwardly socially mobile, and in Cuzco he had connections with distinguished Spanish and Spanish American (creole) residents. \\"The upper classes in Lima saw him as a well-educated Indian,\\"Walker, The Tupac Amaru Rebellion, p. 20. whatever European ancestry he might have had. Between 1776 and 1780 Condorcanqui went into litigation with the Betancur family over the right of succession of the Marquisate of Oropesa and lost the case.First among Incas: The Marquesado de Oropesa Litigation (1741‚Äì1780) en route to the Great Rebellion, David Cahill In 1760, he married Micaela Bastidas Puyucahua of Afro-Peruvian and indigenous descent. Tupac Amaru II inherited the caciqueship, or hereditary chiefdom of Tungasuca and Pampamarca from his older brother, governing on behalf of the Spanish governor.  The Corregidores and the exploitation of the natives  Although the Spanish trusteeship labor system, or encomienda, had been abolished in 1720, most natives at the time living in the Andean region of what is now Ecuador and Bolivia, who made up nine tenths of the population were still pushed into forced labor for what were legally labeled as public work projects.John Crow, The Epic of Latin America ( California: University of California Press Berkeley), p. 404 However, most natives worked under the supervision of a master either tilling soil, mining or working in textile mills. What little wage that was acquired by workers was heavily taxed and cemented Native American indebtedness to Spanish masters. The Roman Catholic Church also had a hand in extorting these natives through collections for saints, masses for the dead, domestic and parochial work on certain days, forced gifts, etc.John Crow, The Epic of Latin America, p. 405 Those not employed in forced labor were still subject to the Spanish provincial governors, or corregidores who also heavily taxed any free natives, similarly ensuring their financial instability. Condorcanqui's interest in the Native American cause had been spurred by the re-reading of one the Royal Commentaries of the Incas, a romantic and heroic account of the history and culture of the ancient Incas. The book was outlawed at the time by the Lima viceroy for fear of it inspiring renewed interest in the lost Inca culture and inciting rebellion.John Crow, The Epic of Latin America ( California: University of California Press Berkeley), p. 406 The marquis's native pride coupled with his hate for the Spanish colonial system, caused him to sympathize and frequently petition for the improvement of native labor in the mills, farms and mines; even using his own wealth to help alleviate the taxes and burdens of the natives. After many of his requests for the alleviation of the native conditions fell on deaf ears, Condorcanqui decided to organize a rebellion. He began to stall on collecting reparto debts and tribute payments, for which the Tinta corregidor and governor Antonio de Arriaga threatened him with death. Condorcanqui changed his name to T√∫pac Amaru II and claimed he was descended from the last Inca ruler, T√∫pac Amaru.Native Insurgencies and the Genocidal Impulse in the Americas, Nicholas A. Robins Rebellion T√∫pac Amaru II The T√∫pac Amaru rebellion was an Inca revival movement that sought to improve the rights of indigenous Peruvians suffering under the Spanish Bourbon Reforms. The rebellion was one of many indigenous Peruvian uprisings in the latter half of the 18th century. It began with the capture and killing of the Tinta Corregidor and Governor Antonio de Arriaga on November 4, 1780, after a banquet attended by both T√∫pac Amaru II and Governor Arriaga.The immediate cause of the rebellion lay in grievances caused by a series of modernising reforms of the colonial administration implemented by the Bourbon monarchy in Spain under Charles III (1759‚Äì88), centralising administrative and economic control and placing heavier tax and labour burdens on both the Indian and Creole populations. The focus of discontent was the main representative of the crown in Peru, the visitador general Jos√© Antonio Areche. Ideologically, the rebellion was complex. At one level, it expressed simply a demand on the Spanish authorities for changes and reforms within the structure of colonial rule, often speaking in the name of the king himself, for example. At another, it envisioned an overthrow of European rule, and something like a restoration of the pre-conquest Inca empire, the Tahuantinsuyo. T√∫pac Amaru's claim to be the legitimate descendant of the Inca suggested the possibility of an aristocratic state similar to the one envisioned in the sixteenth century by the mestizo writer, Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, who saw the Incas as sharing rule with the Spanish aristocracy. But there were also strong millenarian, proto-Jacobin and even proto-communist elements in the rebellion. In the main, the soldiers of the Tupamarista armies were poor Indian peasants, artisans and women, who saw the rebellion not so much as a question of reforms or power sharing but as an opportunity to ‚Äòturn the world upside down‚Äô. The restoration of the Inca Empire meant for them the possibility of an egalitarian society, based economically on the Inca communal agricultural system, the ayllu, and one without castas (racial divisions), rich and poor, or forced labour in haciendas, mines and factories, particularly the dreaded textile mills.‚ÄùThe Epic of Latin America, Fourth Edition, John A. Crow When Arriaga left the party drunk, T√∫pac Amaru II and several of his allies captured him and forced him to write letters to a large number of Spaniards and kuracas. When about 200 of them gathered within the next few days, T√∫pac Amaru II surrounded them with approximately 4,000 natives. Claiming that he was acting under direct orders from the Spanish Crown, Amaru II gave Arriaga's slave Antonio Oblitas the privilege of executing his master. A platform in the middle of a local town plaza was erected, and the initial attempt at hanging the corregidor failed when the noose snapped. Arriaga then ran for his life to try to reach a nearby church, but was not quick enough to escape, and was successfully hanged on the second attempt. After the execution of de Arriaga, Amaru II continued his insurrection. Releasing his first proclamation, Tupac Amaru II announced, \\"that there have been repeated outcries directed to me by the indigenous peoples of this and surrounding provinces, outcries against the abuses committed by European-born crown officials... Justified outcries that have produced no remedy from the royal courts\\" to all the inhabitants of the Spanish provinces. He went on in the same proclamation to state, \\"I have acted ... only against the mentioned abuses and to preserve the peace and well-being of Indians, mestizos, mambos, as well as native-born whites and blacks. I must now prepare for the consequences of these actions.\\" Tupac Amaru II then went on to quickly assemble an army of 6,000 natives who had abandoned their work to join the revolt. As they marched towards Cuzco, the rebels occupied the provinces of Quispicanchis, Tinta, Cotabambas, Calca, and Chumbivilcas. The rebels looted the Spaniards' houses and killed their occupants. The movement was supremely anti-royalist since, upon arriving at a town the rebels would upturn Spanish authority. ‚ÄúWomen, as much as men, were affected by these injustices.‚ÄùSonya Lipsett-Rivera, \\"Gender from 1750 to World War I: Latin America and the Caribbean,\\" in T. Meade and M. Wiesner-Hanks (Eds.) A Companion to Gender History (Oxford: Blackwell,2006), p.481 In fact, Tupac Amaru II's wife, Michaela Bastidas, commanded a battalion of insurgents and was responsible for the uprising in the San Felipe de Tungasuca region. She is also often credited to being more daring and a superior strategist, compared to T√∫pac Amaru II. It is told that she scolded her husband for his weakness and refusal to set up a surprise attack against the Spaniards in Cuzco to catch the weakened city defenders off guard. Instead of listening to his wife, T√∫pac Amaru II lost precious time by encircling the country in hopes that he could gather more recruits for his army. So, by the time the insurgents had attacked the city, the Spaniards had already brought in reinforcements and were able to control and stop the uprising. This led to T√∫pac Amaru II, Micaela Bastidas, and several others to be captured while the rebels scattered. Meade, Teresa A. A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the Present. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2016. During a stage of his rebellion, T√∫pac Amaru II was able to convince the Quechua speakers to join him. Therefore, under his command, the Quechua speakers fought alongside him with Aymara- speaking rebels from Puno on Lake Titicaca and on the Bolivian side of the lake. Unfortunately, the alliance did not last that long and this led the Aymara leader, T√∫pac Katari, to lead his army alone which ultimately led to his capture in October 1781. His partner and female commander, Bartola Sisa, took control after his capture and lead an astonishing amount of 2,000 soldiers for several months. Soon after that in early 1782, the Spanish military defeated the rebels in Peru and Bolivia. According to modern sources, out of the 73 leaders, 32 were women, who were all executed privately. On November 18, 1780, Cuzco dispatched over 1,300 Spanish and Native loyalist troops. The two opposing forces clashed in the town of Sangarar√°. It was an absolute victory for Amaru II and his Native rebels; all 578 Spanish soldiers were killed and the rebels took possession of their weapons and supplies. The victory however, also came with a price. The battle revealed that Amaru II was unable to fully control his rebel followers, as they viciously slaughtered without direct orders. Reports of such violence and the rebels' insistence on the death of Spaniards eliminated any chances for support by the Criollo class. The victory achieved at Sangarar√° would be followed by a string of defeats. The gravest defeat came in Amaru II's failure to capture Cuzco, where his 40,000 ‚Äì 60,000 indigenous followers were repelled by the fortified town consisting of a combined force of loyalist Native troops and reinforcements from Lima. \\"After being repelled from the capital of the ancient Inca empire and intellectual hub of colonial Peru\\"Meade, Teresa A. 2010. A history of modern Latin America: 1800 to the present. Chichester, West Sussex, U.K.: Wiley-Blackwell)(39) Amaru and his men marched through the countryside attempting to recruit any native to his cause, in doing so bolstering his forces. Amaru II's army was surrounded between Tinta and Sangarara and he was betrayed by two of his officers, Colonel Ventura Landaeta and Captain Francisco Cruz, which led to his capture. When his captors attempted to procure the names of his rebel accomplices from him in exchange for promises, Amaru II scornfully replied \\"There are no accomplices here other than you and I. You as oppressor, I as liberator, deserve to die.\\"Daniel Valcarcel. La rebellion de Tupac Amaru (Mexico, 1947)  Death  Amaru II was sentenced to be executed. He was forced to watch the deaths of his wife Micaela Bastidas, his eldest son Hip√≥lito, his uncle Francisco Tupa Amaro, his brother-in-law Antonio Bastidas, and some of his captains before his own death. The following is an extract from the official judicial death issued by the Spanish authorities which condemns T√∫pac Amaru II to torture and death. It was ordered in sentence that T√∫pac Amaru II be condemned to have his tongue cut out, after watching the executions of his family, and to have his hands and feet tied... After the failed dismemberment by the four horses, his body was quartered, and he was then beheaded on the main plaza in Cuzco, in the same place his apparent great-great-great-grandfather T√∫pac Amaru I had been beheaded.  Aftermath  When the revolt continued, the Spaniards executed the remainder of his family, except his 12-year-old son Fernando, who had been condemned to die with him, but was instead imprisoned in Spain for the rest of his life. It is not known if any members of the Inca royal family survived this final purge. Amaru's body parts were strewn across the towns loyal to him as ordered, his houses were demolished, their sites strewn with salt, his goods confiscated, his relatives declared infamous, and all documents relating to his descent burnt.John Crow, The Epic of Latin America, p. 407 At the same time, on May 18, 1781, Incan clothing and cultural traditions, and self- identification as \\"Inca\\" were outlawed, along with other measures to convert the population to Spanish culture and government until Peru's independence as a republic. However, even after the death of Amaru, Native revolts still seized much of what is today southern Peru, Bolivia and Argentina, as Native revolutionaries captured Spanish towns and beheaded many inhabitants. In one instance, a Native-American army under rebel leader T√∫pac Katari besieged the city of La Paz for 109 days before troops sent from Buenos Aires stepped in to relieve the city.  Consequences  Although T√∫pac Amaru II's rebellion was not a success, it marked the first large-scale rebellion in the Spanish colonies and inspired the revolt of many Natives and mestizos in the surrounding area. The rebellion took on important manifestations in \\"Upper Peru\\" or what is today modern Bolivia including the region South and East of Lake Titicaca. Indeed, T√∫pac Amaru II inspired the indigenous peoples to such an extent that even the official document wherein he is condemned to death, it is remarked that \\"the Indians stood firm in the place of our gunfire, despite their enormous fear of it\\" and that despite being captured, his followers remained steadfast in their beliefs in his immortality and heritage. The rebellion gave indigenous Peruvians a new state of mind, a sort of indigenous nationalism that would re-emerge and change shape over the course of the country's future. They were now willing to join forces with anyone who opposed the Spanish. By contrast, the Peruvian creole peoples would prove to be South America's most conservative in the independence movement due to the fear that independence would leave them at the mercy of the Native populations. As well, other Peruvian creoles had prosperous co-owned businesses and land with the Spaniards, and as such did not want to lose those interests in the event of a revolution. While T√∫pac Amaru II's revolt was spawned in the Vilcanota Valley and ended in the city of Cuzco, the legacy and ideology of his revolt had echoes throughout the Andean region.

Biography NSHC statue) Maria Sanford was born in Saybrook, Connecticut. Her love for education began early; at the age of 16 she was already teaching in county day schools. She graduated with honors from State Normal School (now Central Connecticut State University), using her dowry funds for tuition. She rose in the ranks of local and national educators, becoming principal and superintendent of schools in Chester County, Pennsylvania. She took the place of Anna Hallowell and served as professor of history at Swarthmore College from 1871 to 1880. She was one of the first women named to a college professorship. Dr. William Watts Folwell, President of the University of Minnesota at the time, invited Sanford to join the faculty. She did so enthusiastically. Dr. Folwell declared that hiring Sanford was one of his proudest achievements. During her tenure at the university (1880‚Äì1909) Sanford was a professor of rhetoric and elocution, and she lectured on literature and art history. Sanford made strong connections with her students and challenged them with surprise tests and poetry recitations. She held student social events in her home and gave speeches to organizations and groups across the nation. She was a champion of women's rights, supported the education of blacks, pioneered the concept of adult education, and became a founder of parent-teacher organizations. Notably, however, she resisted universal suffrage until her late seventies. Sanford was also a leader in the conservation and beautification program of her new state. She retired in 1909. However, that did not stop Sanford from reaching out to the community and nation with the power of her speeches. She traveled throughout the United States delivering more than 1000 patriotic speeches, the most famous being the powerful address An Apostrophe to the Flag, that she delivered at a national Daughters of the American Revolution convention. Sanford became head director for Northwestern Hospital and created the Minneapolis Improvement League. She was also picked in 1920 to give a speech at the state celebration of the passing of the 19th amendment. In 1910, the University of Minnesota constructed Sanford Hall in honor of Sanford. In 1964 they expanded the building by adding on a \\"Tower\\" to house more students. It was originally built to house the women of the campus. In the 1970s, the hall became coeducational, and housed 502 residents. She died on April 21, 1920, at the age of 83. In June of that year the University of Minnesota held a memorial convocation in her honor. Her death made the cover of the Minneapolis Tribune. A school in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was named Maria Sanford Junior High (now called Sanford Middle School) in memory of her. An elementary school in Montevideo, Minnesota, too, was named Maria L. Sanford Elementary School. She was called \\"the best loved woman of the North Star State.\\" Additionally, an academic hall, Maria Sanford Hall, at Central Connecticut State University is named after her. In 1958, Minnesota picked Sanford to represent the state in Statuary Hall.\\"National Statuary Hall Collection\\". Death Sanford died on April 21, 1920 in Washington, D.C. and is interred at Mount Vernon Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Contour integration is closely related to the calculus of residues, a method of complex analysis. One use for contour integrals is the evaluation of integrals along the real line that are not readily found by using only real variable methods. Contour integration methods include * direct integration of a complex-valued function along a curve in the complex plane (a contour) * application of the Cauchy integral formula * application of the residue theorem One method can be used, or a combination of these methods, or various limiting processes, for the purpose of finding these integrals or sums. Curves in the complex plane In complex analysis a contour is a type of curve in the complex plane. In contour integration, contours provide a precise definition of the curves on which an integral may be suitably defined. A curve in the complex plane is defined as a continuous function from a closed interval of the real line to the complex plane: . This definition of a curve coincides with the intuitive notion of a curve, but includes a parametrization by a continuous function from a closed interval. This more precise definition allows us to consider what properties a curve must have for it to be useful for integration. In the following subsections we narrow down the set of curves that we can integrate to include only those that can be built up out of a finite number of continuous curves that can be given a direction. Moreover, we will restrict the \\"pieces\\" from crossing over themselves, and we require that each piece have a finite (non-vanishing) continuous derivative. These requirements correspond to requiring that we consider only curves that can be traced, such as by a pen, in a sequence of even, steady strokes, which only stop to start a new piece of the curve, all without picking up the pen. Directed smooth curves Contours are often defined in terms of directed smooth curves. These provide a precise definition of a \\"piece\\" of a smooth curve, of which a contour is made. A smooth curve is a curve with a non- vanishing, continuous derivative such that each point is traversed only once ( is one-to-one), with the possible exception of a curve such that the endpoints match (). In the case where the endpoints match the curve is called closed, and the function is required to be one-to-one everywhere else and the derivative must be continuous at the identified point (). A smooth curve that is not closed is often referred to as a smooth arc. The parametrization of a curve provides a natural ordering of points on the curve: comes before if . This leads to the notion of a directed smooth curve. It is most useful to consider curves independent of the specific parametrization. This can be done by considering equivalence classes of smooth curves with the same direction. A directed smooth curve can then be defined as an ordered set of points in the complex plane that is the image of some smooth curve in their natural order (according to the parametrization). Note that not all orderings of the points are the natural ordering of a smooth curve. In fact, a given smooth curve has only two such orderings. Also, a single closed curve can have any point as its endpoint, while a smooth arc has only two choices for its endpoints. Contours Contours are the class of curves on which we define contour integration. A contour is a directed curve which is made up of a finite sequence of directed smooth curves whose endpoints are matched to give a single direction. This requires that the sequence of curves be such that the terminal point of coincides with the initial point of , . This includes all directed smooth curves. Also, a single point in the complex plane is considered a contour. The symbol + is often used to denote the piecing of curves together to form a new curve. Thus we could write a contour that is made up of curves as : \\\\Gamma = \\\\gamma_1 + \\\\gamma_2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\gamma_n. Contour integrals The contour integral of a complex function is a generalization of the integral for real-valued functions. For continuous functions in the complex plane, the contour integral can be defined in analogy to the line integral by first defining the integral along a directed smooth curve in terms of an integral over a real valued parameter. A more general definition can be given in terms of partitions of the contour in analogy with the partition of an interval and the Riemann integral. In both cases the integral over a contour is defined as the sum of the integrals over the directed smooth curves that make up the contour. For continuous functions To define the contour integral in this way one must first consider the integral, over a real variable, of a complex-valued function. Let be a complex-valued function of a real variable, . The real and imaginary parts of are often denoted as and , respectively, so that :f(t) = u(t) + iv(t). Then the integral of the complex-valued function over the interval is given by :\\\\begin{align} \\\\int_a^b f(t) \\\\, dt &= \\\\int_a^b \\\\big( u(t) + i v(t) \\\\big) \\\\, dt \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int_a^b u(t) \\\\, dt + i \\\\int_a^b v(t) \\\\, dt. \\\\end{align} Let be a continuous function on the directed smooth curve . Let be any parametrization of that is consistent with its order (direction). Then the integral along is denoted :\\\\int_\\\\gamma f(z)\\\\, dz\\\\, and is given by : \\\\int_\\\\gamma f(z) \\\\, dz = \\\\int_a^b f\\\\big(\\\\gamma(t)\\\\big) \\\\gamma'(t) \\\\, dt. This definition is well defined. That is, the result is independent of the parametrization chosen. In the case where the real integral on the right side does not exist the integral along is said not to exist. As a generalization of the Riemann integral The generalization of the Riemann integral to functions of a complex variable is done in complete analogy to its definition for functions from the real numbers. The partition of a directed smooth curve is defined as a finite, ordered set of points on . The integral over the curve is the limit of finite sums of function values, taken at the points on the partition, in the limit that the maximum distance between any two successive points on the partition (in the two-dimensional complex plane), also known as the mesh, goes to zero. Direct methods Direct methods involve the calculation of the integral by means of methods similar to those in calculating line integrals in several-variable calculus. This means that we use the following method: *parametrizing the contour *: The contour is parametrized by a differentiable complex-valued function of real variables, or the contour is broken up into pieces and parametrized separately. * substitution of the parametrization into the integrand *: Substituting the parametrization into the integrand transforms the integral into an integral of one real variable. * direct evaluation *: The integral is evaluated in a method akin to a real-variable integral. Example A fundamental result in complex analysis is that the contour integral of is , where the path of the contour is taken to be the unit circle traversed counterclockwise (or any positively oriented Jordan curve about 0). In the case of the unit circle there is a direct method to evaluate the integral :\\\\oint_C \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\,dz. In evaluating this integral, use the unit circle as a contour, parametrized by , with , then and :\\\\oint_C \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\,dz = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\frac{1}{e^{it}} ie^{it}\\\\,dt = i\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} 1 \\\\,dt = \\\\Big[\\\\;t\\\\;\\\\Big]_0^{2\\\\pi} i=(2\\\\pi-0)i = 2\\\\pi i. which is the value of the integral. Applications of integral theorems Applications of integral theorems are also often used to evaluate the contour integral along a contour, which means that the real-valued integral is calculated simultaneously along with calculating the contour integral. Integral theorems such as the Cauchy integral formula or residue theorem are generally used in the following method: * a specific contour is chosen: *: The contour is chosen so that the contour follows the part of the complex plane that describes the real-valued integral, and also encloses singularities of the integrand so application of the Cauchy integral formula or residue theorem is possible * application of Cauchy's integral theorem *: The integral is reduced to only an integration around a small circle about each pole. * application of the Cauchy integral formula or residue theorem *: Application of these integral formulae gives us a value for the integral around the whole of the contour. * division of the contour into a contour along the real part and imaginary part *: The whole of the contour can be divided into the contour that follows the part of the complex plane that describes the real-valued integral as chosen before (call it ), and the integral that crosses the complex plane (call it ). The integral over the whole of the contour is the sum of the integral over each of these contours. * demonstration that the integral that crosses the complex plane plays no part in the sum *: If the integral can be shown to be zero, or if the real-valued integral that is sought is improper, then if we demonstrate that the integral as described above tends to 0, the integral along will tend to the integral around the contour . * conclusion *: If we can show the above step, then we can directly calculate , the real-valued integral. Example 1 Consider the integral :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left(x^2+1\\\\right)^2}\\\\,dx, To evaluate this integral, we look at the complex-valued function :f(z)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\left(z^2+1\\\\right)^2} which has singularities at and . We choose a contour that will enclose the real-valued integral, here a semicircle with boundary diameter on the real line (going from, say, to ) will be convenient. Call this contour . There are two ways of proceeding, using the Cauchy integral formula or by the method of residues: =Using the Cauchy integral formula = Note that: :\\\\oint_C f(z)\\\\,dz = \\\\int_{-a}^a f(z)\\\\,dz + \\\\int_\\\\text{Arc} f(z)\\\\,dz thus :\\\\int_{-a}^a f(z)\\\\,dz = \\\\oint_C f(z)\\\\,dz - \\\\int_\\\\text{Arc} f(z)\\\\,dz Furthermore, observe that :f(z)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\left(z^2+1\\\\right)^2}=\\\\frac{1}{(z+i)^2(z-i)^2}. Since the only singularity in the contour is the one at , then we can write :f(z)=\\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{(z+i)^2}}{(z-i)^2}, which puts the function in the form for direct application of the formula. Then, by using Cauchy's integral formula, :\\\\oint_C f(z)\\\\,dz = \\\\oint_C \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{(z+i)^2}}{(z-i)^2}\\\\,dz = 2\\\\pi i \\\\frac{d}{dz} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{(z+i)^2}\\\\right)\\\\Bigg_{z=i} =2 \\\\pi i \\\\left(\\\\frac{-2}{(z+i)^3}\\\\right)\\\\Bigg_{z = i} =\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} We take the first derivative, in the above steps, because the pole is a second-order pole. That is, is taken to the second power, so we employ the first derivative of . If it were taken to the third power, we would use the second derivative and divide by 2!, etc. The case of to the first power corresponds to a zero order derivative‚Äîjust itself. We need to show that the integral over the arc of the semicircle tends to zero as , using the estimation lemma : \\\\left\\\\int_\\\\text{Arc} f(z)\\\\,dz\\\\right \\\\le ML where is an upper bound on along the arc and the length of the arc. Now, : \\\\left\\\\int_\\\\text{Arc} f(z)\\\\,dz\\\\right\\\\le \\\\frac{a\\\\pi}{\\\\left(a^2-1\\\\right)^2} \\\\rightarrow 0 \\\\mbox{ as } a \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. So :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left(x^2+1\\\\right)^2}\\\\,dx = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(z)\\\\,dz = \\\\lim_{a \\\\to +\\\\infty} \\\\int_{-a}^a f(z)\\\\,dz = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}2.\\\\quad\\\\square =Using the method of residues= Consider the Laurent series of about , the only singularity we need to consider. We then have : f(z) = \\\\frac{-1}{4(z-i)^2} + \\\\frac{-i}{4(z-i)} + \\\\frac{3}{16} + \\\\frac{i}{8}(z-i) + \\\\frac{-5}{64}(z-i)^2 + \\\\cdots (See the sample Laurent calculation from Laurent series for the derivation of this series.) It is clear by inspection that the residue is , so, by the residue theorem, we have :\\\\oint_C f(z)\\\\,dz = \\\\oint_C \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left(z^2+1\\\\right)^2}\\\\,dz = 2 \\\\pi i \\\\,\\\\operatorname{Res}_{z=i} f(z) = 2 \\\\pi i \\\\left(-\\\\frac{i}{4}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{\\\\pi}2 \\\\quad\\\\square Thus we get the same result as before. =Contour note= As an aside, a question can arise whether we do not take the semicircle to include the other singularity, enclosing . To have the integral along the real axis moving in the correct direction, the contour must travel clockwise, i.e., in a negative direction, reversing the sign of the integral overall. This does not affect the use of the method of residues by series. Example 2 ‚Äì Cauchy distribution The integral :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{e^{itx}}{x^2+1}\\\\,dx the contour (which arises in probability theory as a scalar multiple of the characteristic function of the Cauchy distribution) resists the techniques of elementary calculus. We will evaluate it by expressing it as a limit of contour integrals along the contour that goes along the real line from to and then counterclockwise along a semicircle centered at 0 from to . Take to be greater than 1, so that the imaginary unit is enclosed within the curve. The contour integral is :\\\\int_C \\\\frac{e^{itz} }{ z^2+1}\\\\,dz. Since is an entire function (having no singularities at any point in the complex plane), this function has singularities only where the denominator is zero. Since , that happens only where or . Only one of those points is in the region bounded by this contour. The residue of at is :\\\\lim_{z\\\\to i}(z-i)f(z)=\\\\lim_{z\\\\to i}(z-i)\\\\frac{e^{itz} }{ z^2+1}=\\\\lim_{z\\\\to i}(z-i)\\\\frac{e^{itz} }{ (z-i)(z+i)}=\\\\lim_{z\\\\to i}\\\\frac{e^{itz} }{ z+i}=\\\\frac{e^{-t}}{2i}. According to the residue theorem, then, we have :\\\\int_C f(z)\\\\,dz=2\\\\pi i \\\\operatorname{Res}_{z=i}f(z)=2\\\\pi i\\\\frac{e^{-t} }{ 2i}=\\\\pi e^{-t}. The contour may be split into a \\"straight\\" part and a curved arc, so that :\\\\int_\\\\text{straight}+\\\\int_\\\\text{arc}=\\\\pi e^{-t}, and thus :\\\\int_{-a}^a =\\\\pi e^{-t}-\\\\int_\\\\text{arc}. According to the Jordan's lemma, if then :\\\\int_\\\\text{arc}\\\\frac{e^{itz} }{ z^2+1}\\\\,dz \\\\rightarrow 0 \\\\mbox{ as } a\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty. Therefore, if then :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{e^{itx} }{ x^2+1}\\\\,dx=\\\\pi e^{-t}. A similar argument with an arc that winds around rather than shows that if then :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{e^{itx} }{ x^2+1}\\\\,dx=\\\\pi e^t, and finally we have this: :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{e^{itx} }{ x^2+1} \\\\,dx=\\\\pi e^{-t}.\\\\quad\\\\square (If then the integral yields immediately to real-valued calculus methods and its value is .) Example 3 ‚Äì trigonometric integrals Certain substitutions can be made to integrals involving trigonometric functions, so the integral is transformed into a rational function of a complex variable and then the above methods can be used in order to evaluate the integral. As an example, consider :\\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^\\\\pi \\\\frac{1 }{ 1 + 3 (\\\\cos t)^2} \\\\,dt. We seek to make a substitution of . Now, recall :\\\\cos t = \\\\frac12 \\\\left(e^{it}+e^{-it}\\\\right) = \\\\frac12 \\\\left(z+\\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\right) and :\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz,\\\\ dt = \\\\frac{dz}{iz}. Taking to be the unit circle, we substitute to get: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\oint_C \\\\frac{1}{ 1 + 3 \\\\left(\\\\frac12 \\\\left(z+\\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\right)\\\\right)^2} \\\\,\\\\frac{dz}{iz} &= \\\\oint_C \\\\frac{1 }{ 1 + \\\\frac34 \\\\left(z+\\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\right)^2}\\\\frac{1}{iz} \\\\,dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\oint_C \\\\frac{-i}{ z+\\\\frac34 z\\\\left(z+\\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\right)^2}\\\\,dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -i \\\\oint_C \\\\frac{1}{ z+\\\\frac34 z\\\\left(z^2+2+\\\\frac{1}{z^2}\\\\right)} \\\\,dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -i \\\\oint_C \\\\frac{1}{ z+\\\\frac34 \\\\left(z^3+2z+\\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\right)} \\\\,dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -i \\\\oint_C \\\\frac{1}{ \\\\frac34 z^3+\\\\frac52 z+\\\\frac{3}{4z}} \\\\,dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -i \\\\oint_C \\\\frac{4}{ 3z^3+10z+\\\\frac{3}{z}}\\\\,dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -4i \\\\oint_C \\\\frac{1}{ 3z^3+10z+\\\\frac{3}{z}}\\\\,dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -4i \\\\oint_C \\\\frac{z}{ 3z^4+10z^2+3 } \\\\,dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -4i \\\\oint_C \\\\frac{z}{ 3\\\\left(z+\\\\sqrt{3}i\\\\right)\\\\left(z-\\\\sqrt{3}i\\\\right)\\\\left(z+\\\\frac{i}{\\\\sqrt 3}\\\\right)\\\\left(z-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\sqrt 3}\\\\right)}\\\\,dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -\\\\frac{4i}{3} \\\\oint_C \\\\frac{z}{\\\\left(z+\\\\sqrt{3}i\\\\right)\\\\left(z-\\\\sqrt{3}i\\\\right)\\\\left(z+\\\\frac{i}{\\\\sqrt 3}\\\\right)\\\\left(z-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\sqrt 3}\\\\right)}\\\\,dz. \\\\end{align} The singularities to be considered are at \\\\tfrac{\\\\pm i}{\\\\sqrt{3}}.

Note that the bounds of integration may as well be and ‚àí, as in the previous example, or any other pair of endpoints 2 apart. The trick is to use the substitution where and hence : \\\\frac{1}{iz} \\\\,dz = dt. This substitution maps the interval to the unit circle. Furthermore, : \\\\sin(k t) = \\\\frac{e^{i k t} - e^{- i k t}}{2 i} = \\\\frac{z^k - z^{-k}}{2i} and : \\\\cos(k t) = \\\\frac{e^{i k t} + e^{- i k t}}{2} = \\\\frac{z^k + z^{-k}}{2} so that a rational function in results from the substitution, and the integral becomes : \\\\oint_{z=1} f(z) \\\\frac{1}{iz}\\\\, dz which is in turn computed by summing the residues of inside the unit circle. right The image at right illustrates this for : I = \\\\int_0^\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\frac{1}{1 + (\\\\sin t)^2}\\\\, dt, which we now compute. The first step is to recognize that : I = \\\\frac14 \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\frac{1}{1 + (\\\\sin t)^2} \\\\,dt. The substitution yields : \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\oint_{z=1} \\\\frac{4 i z}{z^4 - 6z^2 + 1}\\\\, dz = \\\\oint_{z=1} \\\\frac{i z}{z^4 - 6z^2 + 1}\\\\, dz. The poles of this function are at and . Of these, and are outside the unit circle (shown in red, not to scale), whereas and are inside the unit circle (shown in blue). The corresponding residues are both equal to , so that the value of the integral is : I = 2 \\\\pi i \\\\; 2 \\\\left( - \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{16} i \\\\right) = \\\\pi \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{4}. Example 4 ‚Äì branch cuts Consider the real integral : \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt x}{x^2+6x+8}\\\\,dx. We can begin by formulating the complex integral : \\\\int_C \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt z}{z^2+6z+8}\\\\,dz=I. 180px We can use the Cauchy integral formula or residue theorem again to obtain the relevant residues. However, the important thing to note is that , so has a branch cut. This affects our choice of the contour . Normally the logarithm branch cut is defined as the negative real axis, however, this makes the calculation of the integral slightly more complicated, so we define it to be the positive real axis. Then, we use the so-called keyhole contour, which consists of a small circle about the origin of radius say, extending to a line segment parallel and close to the positive real axis but not touching it, to an almost full circle, returning to a line segment parallel, close, and below the positive real axis in the negative sense, returning to the small circle in the middle. Note that and are inside the big circle. These are the two remaining poles, derivable by factoring the denominator of the integrand. The branch point at was avoided by detouring around the origin. Let be the small circle of radius , the larger, with radius , then :\\\\int_C = \\\\int_\\\\varepsilon^R + \\\\int_\\\\Gamma + \\\\int_R^\\\\varepsilon + \\\\int_\\\\gamma. It can be shown that the integrals over and both tend to zero as and , by an estimation argument above, that leaves two terms. Now since , on the contour outside the branch cut, we have gained 2 in argument along . (By Euler's identity, represents the unit vector, which therefore has as its log. This is what is meant by the argument of . The coefficient of forces us to use 2.) So :\\\\begin{align} \\\\int_R^\\\\varepsilon \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt z}{z^2+6z+8}\\\\,dz&=\\\\int_R^\\\\varepsilon \\\\frac{e^{\\\\frac12 \\\\operatorname{Log} z}}{z^2+6z+8}\\\\,dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\int_R^\\\\varepsilon \\\\frac{e^{\\\\frac12(\\\\logz+i \\\\arg{z})}}{z^2+6z+8}\\\\,dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\int_R^\\\\varepsilon \\\\frac{ e^{\\\\frac12\\\\logz}e^{\\\\frac12(2\\\\pi i)}}{z^2+6z+8}\\\\,dz\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\int_R^\\\\varepsilon \\\\frac{ e^{\\\\frac12\\\\logz}e^{\\\\pi i}}{z^2+6z+8}\\\\,dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\int_R^\\\\varepsilon \\\\frac{-\\\\sqrt z}{z^2+6z+8}\\\\,dz\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\int_\\\\varepsilon^R \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt z}{z^2+6z+8}\\\\,dz. \\\\end{align} Therefore: :\\\\int_C \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt z}{z^2+6z+8}\\\\,dz=2\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt x}{x^2+6x+8}\\\\,dx. By using the residue theorem or the Cauchy integral formula (first employing the partial fractions method to derive a sum of two simple contour integrals) one obtains : \\\\pi i \\\\left(\\\\frac{i}{\\\\sqrt 2}-i\\\\right)=\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt x}{x^2+6x+8}\\\\,dx = \\\\pi\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt 2}\\\\right).\\\\quad\\\\square Example 5 ‚Äì the square of the logarithm right This section treats a type of integral of which :\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\log x}{\\\\left(1+x^2\\\\right)^2} \\\\, dx is an example. To calculate this integral, one uses the function :f(z) = \\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\log z}{1+z^2} \\\\right )^2 and the branch of the logarithm corresponding to . We will calculate the integral of along the keyhole contour shown at right. As it turns out this integral is a multiple of the initial integral that we wish to calculate and by the Cauchy residue theorem we have :\\\\begin{align} \\\\left( \\\\int_R + \\\\int_M + \\\\int_N + \\\\int_r \\\\right) f(z) \\\\, dz &= 2 \\\\pi i \\\\big( \\\\operatorname{Res}_{z=i} f(z) + \\\\operatorname{Res}_{z=-i} f(z) \\\\big) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 2 \\\\pi i \\\\left( - \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} + \\\\frac{1}{16} i \\\\pi^2 - \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} - \\\\frac{1}{16} i \\\\pi^2 \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= - i \\\\pi^2. \\\\end{align} Let be the radius of the large circle, and the radius of the small one. We will denote the upper line by , and the lower line by . As before we take the limit when and . The contributions from the two circles vanish. For example, one has the following upper bound with the lemma: :\\\\left \\\\int_R f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\right \\\\le 2 \\\\pi R \\\\frac{(\\\\log R)^2 + \\\\pi^2}{\\\\left(R^2-1\\\\right)^2} \\\\to 0. In order to compute the contributions of and we set on and on , with : :\\\\begin{align} -i \\\\pi^2 &= \\\\left( \\\\int_R + \\\\int_M + \\\\int_N + \\\\int_r \\\\right) f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\left( \\\\int_M + \\\\int_N \\\\right) f(z)\\\\, dz && \\\\int_R, \\\\int_r \\\\mbox{ vanish} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=-\\\\int_\\\\infty^0 \\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\log(-x + i\\\\varepsilon)}{1+(-x + i\\\\varepsilon)^2} \\\\right )^2\\\\, dx - \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\log(-x - i\\\\varepsilon)}{1+(-x - i\\\\varepsilon)^2}\\\\right)^2 \\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\log(-x + i\\\\varepsilon)}{1+(-x + i\\\\varepsilon)^2} \\\\right )^2 \\\\, dx - \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\log(-x - i\\\\varepsilon)}{1+(-x - i\\\\varepsilon)^2} \\\\right )^2 \\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\log x + i\\\\pi}{1+x^2} \\\\right )^2 \\\\, dx - \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\log x - i\\\\pi}{1+x^2} \\\\right )^2 \\\\, dx && \\\\varepsilon \\\\to 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(\\\\log x + i\\\\pi)^2 - (\\\\log x - i\\\\pi)^2}{\\\\left(1+x^2\\\\right)^2} \\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{4 \\\\pi i \\\\log x}{\\\\left(1+x^2\\\\right)^2} \\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= 4 \\\\pi i \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\log x}{\\\\left(1+x^2\\\\right)^2} \\\\, dx \\\\end{align} which gives :\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\log x}{\\\\left(1+x^2\\\\right)^2} \\\\, dx = - \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}. Example 6 ‚Äì logarithms and the residue at infinity right We seek to evaluate :I = \\\\int_0^3 \\\\frac{x^\\\\frac34 (3-x)^\\\\frac14}{5-x}\\\\,dx. This requires a close study of :f(z) = z^\\\\frac34 (3-z)^\\\\frac14. We will construct so that it has a branch cut on , shown in red in the diagram. To do this, we choose two branches of the logarithm, setting :z^\\\\frac34 = \\\\exp \\\\left (\\\\frac34 \\\\log z \\\\right ) \\\\quad \\\\mbox{where } -\\\\pi \\\\le \\\\arg z < \\\\pi and :(3-z)^\\\\frac14 = \\\\exp \\\\left (\\\\frac14 \\\\log(3-z) \\\\right ) \\\\quad \\\\mbox{where } 0 \\\\le \\\\arg(3-z) < 2\\\\pi. The cut of is therefore and the cut of is . It is easy to see that the cut of the product of the two, i.e. , is , because is actually continuous across . This is because when and we approach the cut from above, has the value : r^\\\\frac34 e^{\\\\frac34 \\\\pi i} (3+r)^\\\\frac14 e^{\\\\frac24 \\\\pi i} = r^\\\\frac34 (3+r)^\\\\frac14 e^{\\\\frac54 \\\\pi i}. When we approach from below, has the value : r^\\\\frac34 e^{-\\\\frac34 \\\\pi i} (3+r)^\\\\frac14 e^{\\\\frac04 \\\\pi i} = r^\\\\frac34 (3+r)^\\\\frac14 e^{-\\\\frac34 \\\\pi i}. But :e^{-\\\\frac34 \\\\pi i} = e^{\\\\frac54 \\\\pi i}, so that we have continuity across the cut. This is illustrated in the diagram, where the two black oriented circles are labelled with the corresponding value of the argument of the logarithm used in and . We will use the contour shown in green in the diagram. To do this we must compute the value of along the line segments just above and just below the cut. Let (in the limit, i.e. as the two green circles shrink to radius zero), where . Along the upper segment, we find that has the value :r^\\\\frac34 e^{\\\\frac04 \\\\pi i} (3-r)^\\\\frac14 e^{\\\\frac24 \\\\pi i} = i r^\\\\frac34 (3-r)^\\\\frac14 and along the lower segment, :r^\\\\frac34 e^{\\\\frac04 \\\\pi i} (3-r)^\\\\frac14 e^{\\\\frac04 \\\\pi i} = r^\\\\frac34 (3-r)^\\\\frac14. It follows that the integral of along the upper segment is in the limit, and along the lower segment, . If we can show that the integrals along the two green circles vanish in the limit, then we also have the value of , by the Cauchy residue theorem. Let the radius of the green circles be , where and , and apply the inequality. For the circle on the left, we find :\\\\left \\\\int_{C_\\\\mathrm{L}} \\\\frac{f(z)}{5-z} dz \\\\right \\\\le 2 \\\\pi \\\\rho \\\\frac{\\\\rho^\\\\frac34 3.001^\\\\frac14}{4.999} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{O} \\\\left( \\\\rho^\\\\frac74 \\\\right) \\\\to 0. Similarly, for the circle on the right, we have :\\\\left \\\\int_{C_\\\\mathrm{R}} \\\\frac{f(z)}{5-z} dz \\\\right \\\\le 2 \\\\pi \\\\rho \\\\frac{3.001^\\\\frac34 \\\\rho^\\\\frac14}{1.999} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{O} \\\\left( \\\\rho^\\\\frac54 \\\\right) \\\\to 0. Now using the Cauchy residue theorem, we have :(-i + 1) I = -2\\\\pi i \\\\left( \\\\operatorname{Res}_{z=5} \\\\frac{f(z)}{5-z} + \\\\operatorname{Res}_{z=\\\\infty} \\\\frac{f(z)}{5-z} \\\\right). where the minus sign is due to the clockwise direction around the residues. Using the branch of the logarithm from before, clearly :\\\\operatorname{Res}_{z=5} \\\\frac{f(z)}{5-z} = - 5^\\\\frac34 e^{\\\\frac14 \\\\log(-2)}. The pole is shown in blue in the diagram. The value simplifies to :-5^\\\\frac34 e^{\\\\frac14(\\\\log 2 + \\\\pi i)} = -e^{\\\\frac14 \\\\pi i} 5^\\\\frac34 2^\\\\frac14. We use the following formula for the residue at infinity: :\\\\operatorname{Res}_{z=\\\\infty} h(z) = \\\\operatorname{Res}_{z=0} \\\\left(- \\\\frac{1}{z^2} h\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\right)\\\\right). Substituting, we find :\\\\frac{1}{5-\\\\frac{1}{z}} = -z \\\\left(1 + 5z + 5^2 z^2 + 5^3 z^3 + \\\\cdots\\\\right) and :\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{z^3}\\\\left (3-\\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\right )\\\\right)^\\\\frac14 = \\\\frac{1}{z} (3z-1)^\\\\frac14 = \\\\frac{1}{z}e^{\\\\frac14 \\\\pi i} (1-3z)^\\\\frac14, where we have used the fact that for the second branch of the logarithm. Next we apply the binomial expansion, obtaining :\\\\frac{1}{z} e^{\\\\frac14 \\\\pi i} \\\\left( 1 - {\\\\frac14 \\\\choose 1} 3z + {\\\\frac14 \\\\choose 2} 3^2 z^2 - {\\\\frac14 \\\\choose 3} 3^3 z^3 + \\\\cdots \\\\right). The conclusion is that :\\\\operatorname{Res}_{z=\\\\infty} \\\\frac{f(z)}{5-z} = e^{\\\\frac14 \\\\pi i} \\\\left (5 - \\\\frac34 \\\\right ) = e^{\\\\frac14 \\\\pi i}\\\\frac{17}{4}. Finally, it follows that the value of is : I = 2 \\\\pi i \\\\frac{e^{\\\\frac14 \\\\pi i}}{-1+i} \\\\left(\\\\frac{17}{4} - 5^\\\\frac34 2^\\\\frac14 \\\\right) = 2 \\\\pi 2^{-\\\\frac12} \\\\left(\\\\frac{17}{4} - 5^\\\\frac34 2^\\\\frac14 \\\\right) which yields :I = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2\\\\sqrt 2} \\\\left(17 - 5^\\\\frac34 2^\\\\frac94 \\\\right) = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2\\\\sqrt 2} \\\\left(17 - 40^\\\\frac34 \\\\right). Evaluation with residue theorem Using the residue theorem, we can evaluate closed contour integrals. The following are examples on evaluating contour integrals with the residue theorem. Using the residue theorem, let's evaluate this contour integral. :\\\\oint_C \\\\frac{e^z}{z^3}\\\\,dz As a refresher, the residue theorem states :\\\\oint_{C} f(z)=2\\\\pi i\\\\cdot \\\\sum\\\\operatorname{Res}(f,a_k), where \\\\operatorname{Res} is the residue of f(z). f(z) has only one pole, 0. From that, we can determine the residue of f(z) to be \\\\tfrac{1}{2} :\\\\begin{align} \\\\oint_C f(z) &=\\\\oint_C \\\\frac{e^z}{z^3}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=2\\\\pi i \\\\cdot \\\\operatorname{Res}_{z=0} f(z)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=2\\\\pi i\\\\operatorname{Res}_{z=0} \\\\frac{e^z}{z^3}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=2\\\\pi i \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\pi i \\\\end{align} Thus, using the residue theorem, we can determine: :\\\\oint_C \\\\frac{e^z}{z^3} = \\\\pi i. Multivariable contour integrals To solve multivariable contour integrals (i.e. surface integrals, complex volume integrals, and higher order integrals), we must use the divergence theorem. For right now, let abla be interchangeable with \\\\operatorname{Div}. These will both serve as the divergence of the vector field denoted as \\\\mathbf{F}. This theorem states: :\\\\underbrace{\\\\int \\\\cdots \\\\int_U}_n \\\\operatorname{Div}(\\\\mathbf{F}) \\\\, dV = \\\\underbrace{ \\\\oint \\\\cdots \\\\oint_{\\\\partial U} }_{n-1} \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{n} \\\\, dS In addition, we also need to evaluate abla\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} where abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} is an alternate notation of \\\\operatorname{Div} (\\\\mathbf{F}). The Divergence of any dimension can be described as :\\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{Div}(\\\\mathbf{F}) &= abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{F}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial u}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z},\\\\cdots \\\\right) \\\\cdot (F_u,F_x,F_y,F_z\\\\cdots)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial F_u}{\\\\partial u} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_x}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_y}{\\\\partial y} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_z}{\\\\partial z}\\\\cdots \\\\right) \\\\end{align} Example 1 Let the vector field \\\\mathbf{F}=\\\\sin(2x)+\\\\sin(2y)+\\\\sin(2z) and be bounded by the following :{0\\\\leq x\\\\leq 1} \\\\quad {0\\\\leq y\\\\leq 3\\\\pi} \\\\quad {-1\\\\leq z\\\\leq 4} The corresponding double contour integral would be set up as such: : We now evaluate abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{F}. While we're at it, let's set up the corresponding triple integral: :\\\\begin{align} &=\\\\iiint_V \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial F_x}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_y}{\\\\partial y} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_z}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)\\\\,dV\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\iiint_V \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\sin(2x)}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\sin(2y)}{\\\\partial y} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\sin(2z)}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)\\\\,dV\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\iiint_V 2(\\\\cos(2x) + \\\\cos(2y) + \\\\cos(2z)) \\\\,dV \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\int_{0}^{1}\\\\int_{0}^{3}\\\\int_{-1}^{4} 2(\\\\cos(2x)+\\\\cos(2y)+\\\\cos(2z))\\\\,dx\\\\,dy\\\\,dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\int_{0}^{1}\\\\int_{0}^{3}(10\\\\cos(2y)+\\\\sin(8)+\\\\sin(2)+10\\\\cos(z))\\\\,dy\\\\,dz\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\int_{0}^{1}(30\\\\cos(2z)+3\\\\sin(2)+3\\\\sin(8)+5\\\\sin(6))\\\\,dz\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=18\\\\sin(2)+3\\\\sin(8)+5\\\\sin(6) \\\\end{align} Example 2 For example, let the vector field \\\\mathbf{F}=u^4+x^5+y^6+z^{-3}, and n is the fourth dimension. Let this vector field be bounded by the following: :{0\\\\leq x\\\\leq 1} \\\\quad {-10\\\\leq y\\\\leq 2\\\\pi} \\\\quad {4\\\\leq z\\\\leq 5} \\\\quad {-1\\\\leq u\\\\leq 3} To evaluate this, we must utilize the divergence theorem as stated before, and we must evaluate abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{F}. For right now, let dV=dxdydzdu : :\\\\begin{align} &=\\\\iiiint_V \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial F_u}{\\\\partial u} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_x}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_y}{\\\\partial y} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_z}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)\\\\,dV\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\iiiint_V \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u^4}{\\\\partial u} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial x^5}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial y^6}{\\\\partial y} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial z^{-3}}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)\\\\,dV\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\iiiint_V {{\\\\frac{4 u^3 z^4 + 5 x^4 z^4 + 5 y^4 z^4 - 3}{z^4}}}\\\\,dV \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\iiiint_V {{\\\\frac{4 u^3 z^4 + 5 x^4 z^4 + 5 y^4 z^4 - 3}{z^4}}}\\\\,dV \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\int_{0}^{1}\\\\int_{-10}^{2\\\\pi}\\\\int_{4}^{5}\\\\int_{-1}^{3} \\\\frac{4 u^3 z^4 + 5 x^4 z^4 + 5 y^4 z^4 - 3}{z^4}\\\\,dV\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\int_{0}^{1}\\\\int_{-10}^{2\\\\pi}\\\\int_{4}^{5}\\\\left(\\\\frac{4(3u^4z^3+3y^6+91z^3+3)}{3z^3}\\\\right)\\\\,dy\\\\,dz\\\\,du\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\int_{0}^{1}\\\\int_{-10}^{2\\\\pi}\\\\left(4u^4+\\\\frac{743440}{21}+\\\\frac{4}{z^3}\\\\right)\\\\,dz\\\\,du\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\int_{0}^{1} \\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi^2}+\\\\frac{1486880\\\\pi}{21}+8\\\\pi u^4+40 u^4+\\\\frac{371720021}{1050}\\\\right)\\\\,du\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\frac{371728421}{1050}+\\\\frac{14869136\\\\pi^3-105}{210\\\\pi^2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\approx{576468.77} \\\\end{align} Thus, we can evaluate a contour integral of the fourth dimension.  Integral representation  An integral representation of a function is an expression of the function involving a contour integral. Various integral representations are known for many special functions. Integral representations can be important for theoretical reasons, e.g. giving analytic continuation or functional equations, or sometimes for numerical evaluations. Hankel's contour For example, the original definition of the Riemann zeta function via a Dirichlet series, :\\\\zeta(s) = \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{1}{n^s}, is valid only for . But :\\\\zeta(s) = - \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(1 - s)}{2 \\\\pi i} \\\\int_H\\\\frac{(-t)^{s-1}}{e^t - 1} dt , where the integration is done over the Hankel contour , is valid for all complex s not equal to 1.

In 1651, he was executed by the English government for plotting with the exiled Stuart court. The Puritan faction in England considered Love to be a martyr and hero. Life Portrait of Mr. Christor. Love, minister Love was born in 1618 in Cardiff. At age 14, Love became an adherent to the Puritan congregation. His father disapproved of Love's interests in religion and sent him to London to become an apprentice. However, in 1636, Love's mother and his religious mentor sent him to Oxford University instead. When William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury, introduced his Canons of 1640 to reform the English church, Love was one of the first Puritans to renounce them. As a young man, Love became the domestic chaplain to John Warner, the sheriff of London.http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/biog/love-christopher.htm St. Ann's, Aldersgate invited Love to become a lecturer, but William Juxon, the bishop of London, refused to provide Love with an allowance for three years; Archbishop Laud had warned Juxon to keep an eye on Love. Declining Episcopal ordination, Love went to Scotland to seek ordination from the Presbytery there; However, the Scottish Church would only ordain residents of Scotland and Love planned to return to England. On Love's return to England around 1641, he was invited by the mayor and aldermen of Newcastle to preach there. In Newcastle, Love started attacking what he saw as errors in the Book of Common Prayer in his sermons, resulting in his being sent to gaol. After filing a writ of Habeas Corpus, the Newcastle authorities sent Love to London. He was tried in the king's bench and acquitted of all charges. Around the outbreak of the First English Civil War, Love preached as a lecturer at Tenterden, Kent, on the lawfulness of a defensive war. The authorities accused him of treason, but Love was again acquitted in court and was able to recover his court costs. Shortly afterward, Love was appointed as chaplain to Colonel John Venn's regiment, and became preacher to the garrison of Windsor Castle. On 23 January 1644, at Aldermanbury, London, Love received Presbyterian ordination from Thomas Horton. Love was one of the first preachers in England to receive this appointment. He then became the pastor of St Lawrence Jewry. According to William Maxwell Hetherington, Love was a superadded member of the Westminster Assembly. http://www.reformed.org/books/hetherington/west_assembly/index.html?mainframe=/books/hetherington/west_assembly/chapter_2.html However, this assertion was questioned by Alexander Ferrier Mitchell, for lack of evidence and the more careful edition of the minutes of the Westminster Assembly by Chad van Dixhorn shows that Hetherington was in error and Love was not made a member of the Assembly. On 31 January 1645, Love preached an inflammatory sermon in Uxbridge. This was the same day that the commissioners for the Treaty of Uxbridge arrived there. In his Vindication manuscript, Love claimed that his preaching there was accidental; however, the House of Commons voted to bring Love to London and confine him at the House during the negotiations. On 25 November 164, Love preached before the Commons; he did not receive the customary vote of thanks. His House sermon offended the Independents, who on gaining power in the House confined Love again. A House committee for plundered ministers cited Love on two more occasions. Although Love was discharged, the English authorities watched his movements. Plot to restore Charles II In 1651, Love became involved in a plot to restore Charles II as the king of England. In the plot, the Presbyterians sent Colonel Silius Titus to France to deliver letters to Henrietta Maria, the mother of Charles II; Colonel Ashworth brought the replies to Love's house in London. On 18 December 1650, Love's wife obtained an official pass to travel to Amsterdam. During this period, Love also received letters from Scottish Presbyterians who were sympathetic to Charles II. Love also hosted discussions in his home how to raise money for firearms from the English Presbyterians. On 7 May 1651, Love and other prominent Presbyterians were arrested and confined in Liverpool. Bremer-Webster, p. 7. On 14 May 1651, Love was ordered to be arrested on charges of high treason and was confined to the Tower of London. In late June and 5 July, he was tried before the high court of justice. Love was defended by Matthew Hale; presiding at the trial was Richard Keble. On 16 July, Love was convicted of treason and sentenced to death. Robert Hammond wrote to Oliver Cromwell asking for leniency for Love. Love received first a one-month reprieve and then a one-week reprieve. On 16 August, Love wrote his final appeal for leniency to the English parliament. In this appeal, he admitted guilt to virtually all of his charges. However, the English courts wanted to make an example of Love to quash any further trouble from the Presbyterians. Death On 23 August 1651, Christopher Love was executed on Tower Hill in London. His execution was attended by Simeon Ashe and Edmund Calamy.Bremer-Webster, p. 10. On 25 August. Love was privately buried at St. Lawrence Church. His funeral sermon was preached by Thomas Manton.Bremer- Webster, p. 163. Robert Wild (poet) wrote a poem The Tragedy of Mr. Christopher Love at Tower Hill (1651). Love was married to Mary Stone, a ward of John Warner. The couple had five children, one of whom was born after Love's death. Works After Love's execution, leading Presbyterians of London (Edmund Calamy, Simeon Ashe, Jeremiah Whitaker, William Taylor, and Allan Geare) published Love's sermons. The most important of his works are: *Grace, the Truth and Growth, and different Degrees thereof (226 pp., London, 1652); *Heaven's Glory, Hell's Terror (350 pp., 1653); *Combate between the Flesh and the Spirit (292 pp., 1654); *Treatise of Effectual Calling (218 pp.,1658); *The Natural Man's Case Stated (8vo, 280 pp., 1658); *Select Works (8vo, Glasgow, 1806‚Äì07, 2 vols.). Short and plaine Animadversions on some Passages in Mr. Dels' Sermon (1646) was a reply to William Dell. A modest and clear Vindication of the ... ministers of London from the scandalous aspersions of John Price (1649) (attributed to Love) replied to the Clerico- classicum of John Price.

The character, called simply \\"Carter\\" by most other characters, is introduced in the pilot episode and appears for eleven consecutive seasons. Wyle decided to leave the show as a regular character at the conclusion of season 11, despite offers to stay.*Coleridge, Daniel R., \\"Noah Wyle's 'ER' Dilemma ,\\" TV Guide, December 3, 2004 He cited a budding family and an already lengthy tenure on the show as reasons. Carter was then written out of the show by moving to Africa and marrying his love interest, Makemba Likasu, in the episode \\"The Show Must Go On\\". Noah Wyle agreed to make a four-episode appearances in season 12. Because of the WGA Strike, ER was renewed for a 15th season (it was originally slated to end after season 14), during which Wyle appeared in five episodes as part of the show's plan to bring back former regulars. Character history Carter arrived at County General as a third-year medical student. His career got off to a rocky start when on his first day at County, he nearly vomited in the emergency room after seeing a critically wounded patient and had to be consoled by Chief Resident Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards). Carter had a dedicated and compassionate approach with his patients. Initially interested in surgery, he switched to Emergency Medicine, much to his surgeon mentor Dr. Peter Benton's initial dismay and disappointment. During his surgical residency Carter lamented on the lack of patient connection and specifically regretted the lack of thorough follow-up and care. In order for Carter to change from his surgical residency to an emergency medicine residency, he agreed to work without pay. He was part of an influential and wealthy family and did not need to work, enabling County General to take him on despite the lack of funding for an additional position. As a resident his confidence grew, and he often went out of his way to help patients. Carter being held at gunpoint by guerrillas in the Congo. Season 6‚Äì7 During season 6, Carter and medical student Lucy Knight (Kellie Martin) were stabbed by patient Paul Sobricki (David Krumholtz), a law student suffering from schizophrenia. Knight died from her injuries while Carter's injuries left him with lifelong kidney problems. As a result of Carter's chronic battle with pain, survivor guilt, and resistance to getting help, he eventually developed an addiction to narcotics. He began making mistakes at work. After Abby Lockhart (Maura Tierney) caught him injecting left-over fentanyl from a trauma into his wrist, Carter's colleagues held an intervention and Dr. Greene demanded that he go to an inpatient rehab center for medical doctors in Atlanta or be fired. Although initially opposed to going, Dr. Benton convinced him and boarded the plane with him. Upon returning from rehab in season 7, Carter made peace with his brain-damaged heroin-addict cousin, Chase, and apologized for his long absence, saying, \\"I didn't want to admit to the fact that I was just like you.\\" At the end of the season, Kerry Weaver returned Carter's application for Chief Resident because of his history of addiction. Season 9‚Äì10 During season 9, Carter began sleeping with Abby after they were quarantined in the ER for two weeks because of the outbreak of monkeypox. Meanwhile, the health of Carter's grandmother, Millicent (Gamma), continued to decline, and his mother, Eleanor, had difficulty accepting her divorce from Carter's father, Jack. Worse, Abby and Carter continued to disagree over whether or not Abby (a recovering alcoholic) should be drinking at all, even moderately. These personal issues come to a head when Abby's bipolar brother Eric reappeared the day Gamma died. Abby giving precedence to her duty as a sister marked the beginning of the end of Carter and Abby's relationship. Unable to shake his grief, Carter decided to join Dr. Kovaƒç in Congo without Abby's support. While there, he mended his previous rift with Kovaƒç (due to their feelings for Abby) and they began to understand one another better. When the clinic is overrun by militia, Carter is threatened by guerrilla soldiers. However, a young soldier recognized Carter as the doctor that tried desperately to save his brother though he ultimately failed. Out of respect for Carter's actions, the guerrillas spare everyone at the clinic aside from an Army soldier they had been treating. He returned two weeks later in season 10. When Kovaƒç is reported killed in Africa, Carter went back to retrieve his body but found Kovaƒç ill with malaria. He arranged for Kovaƒç to be sent home, and sent a letter for Abby ending their relationship. Dr. Carter remained in Africa for several months and worked in Kem's AIDS clinic. Carter and Kem develop a relationship and when she becomes pregnant he asks her to accompany him to Chicago where he introduces her to his colleagues. Kem's pregnancy ends tragically at eight months forcing her to give birth to a stillborn son in the episode \\"Midnight\\", much to her and Carter's overwhelming grief. He is supported emotionally by his father and by his friends Luka Kovaƒç and Abby Lockhart. Kem and Carter's relationship manages to survive. Season 11‚Äì12 During season 11, Carter started building an HIV/AIDS clinic adjacent to County General, with funding from his family's charity foundation. It is named after his stillborn son - \\"The Joshua Makalo Carter Center.\\" Afterward, he went to Paris, where Kem is visiting her mother. They reconnect and he offered to go to Africa with her so they can start afresh. She hesitated but later accepted the offer. Dr. Carter returned to Chicago and bids adieu to his friends and colleagues. In a fitting ending to his career at County, Carter's last patient is a young girl who he had delivered 11 years before when he had just been first starting out. In season 12, Carter appeared in a four episode arc, working with a fellow doctor in Darfur, Sudan, where he is joined by Dr. Pratt and Debbie (Mary McCormack). Pratt informed him that Luka and Abby have reunited and are expecting a baby. Season 15 In the season 15 episode, \\"The Book of Abby\\", long-serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. However, Carter's is missing; according to Haleh, he did not want to do it because it was \\"defacing government property.\\" Carter later returned in the season 15 episode, \\"The Beginning of the End\\", in which he rejoined the ER at County General. He explained to Cate Banfield that he was relocating to Chicago, and was looking to pick up some shifts. She agreed, after finding out that one of his teachers at the hospital was Mark Greene. He visited the Joshua Makalo Carter Center. At the end of the episode, it was shown that Carter was on dialysisThe Beginning of the End, NBC episode summary because of amyloidosis developing from schistosomiasis which irreparably damaged Carter's remaining kidney. He was back in Chicago to be placed on the US transplant list. Working in the ER once again, he was shown to still be a good doctor with good judgment, but was still catching up with the latest medicines and techniques being used in the US. Eventually, his condition worsened, causing him to collapse while attending to a patient. While being treated by Dr. Gates and Dr. Morris, he goes into V-tach, but was brought back thanks to Morris's quick-thinking. He was then transferred to Northwestern Medical Center. In the episode \\"Old Times\\", while a patient at Northwestern, he was visited by his mentor and good friend Dr. Peter Benton, to whom he revealed that his marriage with Kem was going through a rough patch. In the same episode, Dr. Benton acted as a back-seat driver and supervised the operation to make sure Carter was well taken care of. Thanks to Benton's thoroughness which initially annoyed the surgeon performing the operation, a complication was resolved and the operation was a success. Unbeknownst to Carter, the kidney was arranged for him thanks to the efforts of his old friends Carol Hathaway and Doug Ross who were also unaware that they were helping Carter and only found out that \\"some doctor\\" got the kidney. In \\"And In The End\\", the series finale, Carter used his family fortune to finally open the Joshua Carter Center, a medical clinic for the underprivileged that fitted into the plans he announced when his grandmother's will was read. Kem surprised Carter by attending the opening ceremony however she was seemingly uncomfortable around him. In a later conversation she told him how she felt sad in Chicago because it reminded her of their son's death. As she leaves the clinic's opening she okayed Carter to call her to set up breakfast before she flew back to Paris. Carter indicated he might come back to County for good; however, this was potentially contradicted by his earlier idea that he would leave Chicago if that's what it took to save his marriage. In the final scene, victims of an explosion come to County and while tending to a patient he invites Rachel Greene, Dr. Mark Greene's daughter who is considering to go into medical school, to come help him, even calling her ‚ÄúDr. Greene.‚Äù Related characters Early in the series, Carter's plots typically stayed in the realm of the ER. In a symbolic gesture of this transference, he was told by Mark Greene \\"you set the tone\\" on Dr. Greene's last day in the ER. Dr. Greene had been told the same thing, by Dr. Morgenstern, in the pilot episode in season 1 of the show. Dr. Carter, in turn, said the same thing to Dr. Archie Morris as Carter left the ER, although Morris did not understand the significance. Family Eleanor and John Carter Throughout the course of the series (particularly at the beginning of season 8) we meet various members of Carter's wealthy family and see how he is very uncomfortable being an upper-class young man, to the point where he goes out of his way to not talk about his background. His father, John (Jack) Truman Carter Jr. (Michael Gross) is caring but stiff, and very acquiescent with his wife until he gets tired of her being an \\"emotional vampire\\" and divorces her. He and Carter have an awkward relationship where they love each other but John doesn't respect his father. Jack recognizes this and keeps some distance from him as a result of it. Carter's mother, Eleanor (Mary McDonnell), is emotionally distant and cold. Her personality was largely shaped because she blamed herself for Carter's older brother, Bobby's death from leukemia. Carter eventually figures out that much of her sadness comes from this and they briefly become closer, but eventually Eleanor removes herself from any ties to her family after Jack divorces her, to the point where John has no idea how to reach her and she refuses to return a phone call he makes after Millicent Carter (who disliked her intensely) passes away. It is noteworthy that neither of Carter's parents are present when he dedicates the Joshua Carter Public Health building in the series finale. Carter's grandfather, John Truman Carter Sr. (George Plimpton), is the most disappointed by Carter's career choice, and though Carter respects him, he also resents him for that. Carter's grandmother, Millicent Carter (Frances Sternhagen), is a benefactor of the hospital, even funding Carol Hathaway's clinic. Carter is very close to his grandmother (whom he calls \\"Gamma\\") and intermittently lives at her home. They do occasionally argue, however, usually in regard to Carter's reluctance to participate in matters related to the family foundation; Gamma modifies her will to remove Jack as the head of the foundation and puts John in charge of it, leading to him changing its mission from supporting Chicago arts programs to supporting public health initiatives. Chase Carter (Jonathan Scarfe) is John's first cousin and a \\"functioning\\" heroin addict. Carter, with the assistance of his colleague Anna, attempts to detox and rehabilitate him, but fails.

The black budget can be complicated to calculate, but in the United States it has been estimated to be over US$50 billion a year. United States Data visualization of U.S. intelligence black budget (2013) The United States Department of Defense has a black budget it uses to fund black projects‚Äîexpenditures that it does not want to disclose publicly. The annual cost of the United States Department of Defense black budget was estimated at $30 billion in 2008, but was increased to an estimated $50 billion in 2009. A black budget article by The Washington Post, based on information given by Edward Snowden, detailed how the US allocated $52.8 billion in 2012 for the black budget. The black budget has been known to hide multiple types of projects from elected officials. With secret code names and hidden figures, the details of the black budget are revealed only to certain people of congress, if at all. This budget was approved by the US National Security Act of 1947, which created the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Council and reorganized some military bases with help of the Defense Department. The U.S. Government claims that the money given to this budget investigates advanced sciences and technologies for military issues. This kind of research is responsible for the creation of new aircraft, weapons, and satellites. In 2018, some newspapers reported that the Trump administration asked for $81.1 billion for the 2019 black budget. The request included $59.9 billion for the National Intelligence Program, covering non-military programs and activities. Also $21.2 billion for the Military Intelligence Program which covers Intelligence activities by the Department of Defense. ‚ÄúIn total, these two are more than 3.4% higher than the FY2018 request and the largest since then...

His sudden resignation ‚Äì as well as that of his chief, DCI George Tenet the previous day ‚Äì led to speculation that it was over the controversy surrounding Iraq weapons of mass destruction or 9-11 intelligence issues. Background Pavitt was born in St. Louis, Missouri and graduated from the University of Missouri (B.A., 1968) in Columbia, MissouriDana Priest, Retired Official Defends the CIA's Performance, , Washington Post, November 5, 2004 as a member of Phi Beta Kappa.

Pavitt joined the CIA in 1973 as a Career Trainee with postings to Europe, Asia and Washington. He was posted to Vienna (1976-1978), East Berlin (1978-1980), Budapest, Hungary and Malaysia (1980-1983).Vernon Loeb, Rebuilding Clandestine Operations, , Washington Post, September 20, 1999 He was expelled (PNG'd) from East Germany.

Bush.James L. Pavitt Biography, , Patriot Defense Group After being assigned to work across the Agency operational/analytical divide in the Directorate of Intelligence, he became the founder and first Chief of the Directorate of Operation's Counterproliferation Division (CPD). Gordon Oehler, then Chief of the Directorate of Intelligence's Non-Proliferation Center, criticized this as being redundant and stepping on his turf. This was considered a specious critique by veteran Agency HUMINT Operations Officers, however, especially those who had been assigned under Oehler previously and realized that Oehler held HUMINT counterproliferation operations‚Äîindeed, covert operations in general‚Äîin considerable disdain. Pavitt hand picked operations officers, some of which were Nonofficial Cover Officers (NOCs) including Valerie Plame, to staff the CPD. In 1997 he was appointed Associate Deputy Director of Operations. He was Deputy Director of Operations from 1999 until his resignation in 2004. In 2003, the CPD took down the nuclear black market being operated by Abdul Qadeer Khan. After September 11, 2001, Pavitt was responsible for sending Special Activities Division teams to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand, and Somalia to capture Al Qaeda members. The first Hellfire missiles fired from drones were under his command. They were aimed at an Al Qaeda convoy in Sudan in which all occupants, including an American citizen, were killed. In April 2004 he appeared before the 9/11 Commission. The BBC called his 9/11 commission appearance 'unprecedented'. The commission's report said that shortly after Bush's election, Pavitt told the President-elect that Osama bin Laden was one of the gravest threats to the country. He also added that killing the Al Qaeda leader would have an effect but not stop the threat posed by the terrorist organization. When Bush put Porter Goss in charge of the agency, Pavitt reportedly opposed the internal reorganizations announced by Goss, on the ground that they might \\"do damage to a strategic effort that has produced excellent work on terrorism and a variety of other important issues.\\" On June 4, 2004, he unexpectedly announced his retirement one day after George Tenet. The CIA says Pavitt's decision was unconnected with Tenet's departure. Pavitt was succeeded by his deputy, Stephen Kappes.

Released as OVA, the series consists of eleven mainly unrelated episodes referred to as operations and is most noted for its very extreme sexual content, most of which center on BDSM and similar fetish themes as well as its high production values (compared to other hentai titles of the time).  Episodes  Operation 01: Curious Fruit An innocent girl named Ai is lured by her curiosity into the underground world of sado-masochists and exhibitionists by a couple who visits the club where she and her girlfriends are visiting. For some strange reason, Ai follows the two, and is drawn into a world of bondage and rough sex. The experience transforms the girl, who embraces the lifestyle, and a weird but romantic relation with a man she is drawn to. Operation 02: Sacred Girl A reclusive young man and his younger sister live in a mansion together, where the young man frequently hosts sex parties every night, which he watches in his room via a network of surveillance cameras. It is later revealed that he wants to have sex with his sister, which he eventually does in a consensual scene near the end of the episode. Operation 03: Lover Doll / Winter Swimsuit / Enema =Lover Doll= An anthropomorphic female rabbit is held in a cell as sexual slave. Soon, a Catgirl enters her room and has sex with the rabbit through the cell. Later, a man comes in and punishes the Catgirl for wandering off, then proceeds to rape her. =Winter Swimsuit= With a subtle BDSM premise, a teenage couple has sex in what seems to be a closed public bath house at night in the middle of winter. A reluctant girl is fondled, has her bathing suit cut off to expose her erogenous zones, and is coerced into performing various sex acts by her unnamed male partner. =Enema= An unnamed girl is coaxed into having sex in the women's bathroom. The ensuing sex acts culminate in anal sex which cures her constipation. Operation 04: Kirei The episode begins when a young blue-haired woman is shown having sex with a group of weird men, afterwards they throw her into an oubliette where she then emerges as a butterfly. In what seems to be an island paradise, two well-endowed girls called Rui and Kirei are on vacation. As time progresses, they notice that there is something unusual with the natives and the beautiful butterflies that inhabit the island. As they begin to notice these oddities, they begin to have sex with each other and the natives. The episode ends with the girls being gang raped, then thrown down the same oubliette from the beginning of the episode, and emerging as butterflies. Operation 05: Seek I (Slave Girl Marino) The story begins when an ordinary girl named Marino Okura-(a virgin) is being chased by two young men who are revealed to be human traffickers. After getting captured, she is then shown in their car nervous and scared. When she attempts to escape, she is pulled back and brought into the estate of the dominatrix Saki and her unnamed master. Saki and her master spend the episode training Marino to be their sex slave, a process which involves Marino being forced to perform various sex acts and submit to the demands of her masters. As the episode progresses, it becomes apparent that Saki's current master is actually the son of her original master, now deceased. Saki's original master made a living as a world-famous bondage artist. This, however, was only his public face. His true face was that of a masochist female dominator. The episode culminates with Marino being left chained in a cell to await her next \\"session\\". Operation 06: Seek II (SM Queen Saki) This episode is a continuation of Operation 05, and takes place during a sex party commemorating the anniversary of Saki's master's death. Saki presents the guests with a gift: Marino and two other girls (Momomi and Haruka), as their sex toys for the evening. Despite the introduction of new characters, this episode focuses mostly on Saki and her relationship with her previous master. Scenes of Saki reminiscing about her S&M; training as a child are interspersed with displays of Marino and the other girls being subjected to humiliation and torture at Saki's hands. As Saki masturbates to thoughts of her deceased master, the three slaves enter the room, armed with bondage equipment, and take Saki back to the main party hall. Here, her current master presents Saki to the party guests for their enjoyment. Saki is subjected to much the same treatment to which she earlier exposed the other girls and is gang-raped; the episode ends with Saki being chained in a cell of her own. Operation 07: Yellow Star Ayana's mother marries a famous detective and introduces him to Ayana. The detective is mysterious and furtive, a 'hero' in local media, who had been following the distribution of an illegal drug, called \\"Yellow Star\\", which is a mild hallucinogen, paralyzing agent, and aphrodisiac. Ayana brags about how big her new father is to her boyfriend, Kohei. The detective is revealed to be corrupt, killing a competitor on a train by placing an explosive device near him. He thanks two shadowy figures who provided him with both the explosive and \\"yellow star\\". He grows close to Ayana and hatches various plans. It becomes apparent that the detective is buying a steady supply of the illegal drug as part of a long-term strategy to sexually abuse his stepdaughter. The abuse escalates as Ayana herself becomes addicted to Yellow Star, unable to refuse her new father's increasingly violent sexual fantasies. Ayana's abuse culminates in her gang rape at the hands of her stepfather and two well-endowed drug manufacturers. After the incident, Ayana realizes the abuse will continue with more rape and drug abuse. She kills her stepfather and returns to a normal life with her boyfriend, Kohei. In the final scene, Ayana waits in a park for Kohei (who believes she remains a virgin for him) but is abducted before they can meet. The two men who kidnapped her are soon revealed to be the distributors of \\"yellow star\\" and force her into another abusive encounter with them. It is implied that their endless supply of Yellow Star will equate to Ayana's endless gang-rape. The character designer for this episode was Yasuomi Umetsu. It can be seen as a precursor to Kite. In a scene cut from the original, the two Yellow Star manufacturers are shown to be demanding to engage in sexual activity with Ayana as their price for access to the drug. Operation 08: Slave Warrior Maya I The first of a two-episode story arc and based from manga series of the same name, this episode begins the story of Maya Misutani, an average high school student who is transported to an alternate dimension and inadvertently fulfills a prophecy. Maya is transported to another world, where she meets two lizard-like creatures who use trickery to convince her to take all of her clothes off where she is sold into slavery to Lord Estilgar, and used in experiments to turn her into a sex slave. She escapes and evades recapture by using a hidden power within herself to slaughter her opponents. This display of power gets the attention of two warring human and alien factions. Maya is recaptured, subjected to more sexual experiments, and is transformed into a hermaphrodite. Operation 09: Slave Warrior Maya II Continuing the story, Maya is transferred to a dominatrix who is given instructions to break her will and turn her into a sex slave. About this time, two members from one of the human factions are sent to investigate the power that was unleashed by Maya, citing a prophecy of a warrior long held in their culture. In captivity, Maya meets another slave, Leyna, who is now used for sex. They escape, but are quickly caught. Leyna is punished through sexual intercourse. Meanwhile, the dominatrix implants a parasitic alien mass into Maya's uterus through her mechanically stretched vagina to lower her inhibitions and forces her to copulate with Leyna. As she is about to succumb to her sexual desires, Maya unleashes her hidden power and becomes the warrior prophesied. Operation 10: Binding Masaki is on a train, dreaming about a woman he has never met. When he wakes up, he finds that his belongings have been stolen and that he is stranded. Masaki follows the woman who stole his things, which leads him to her mansion, where she lives with a group of other women. Masaki stays the night and soon realizes that he has stumbled into a S&M; situation. The oldest woman is the mistress of the house and the younger women are her slaves. This leads to his voyeuristic observation of various sexual acts, before actually engaging in sex with several of the residents. Eventually there's an earthquake which destroys the house, though Masaki and one of the girls manage to escape. The episode ends with the two of them walking along the train tracks before a train roars towards them. Right before impact however, Masaki wakes up, still on the train with his sketch book in his lap. He opens the book and sees a drawing of the girl who left with him. Operation 11: Fallen Angel Rina Pop idol Rina is renowned for her amazing stage shows and musical talent, which gets her noticed by a new production company, Angel Productions. At one of her concerts, she learns that her father has suffered a medical emergency, and has been hospitalized. The manager of Angel Productions approaches her about switching to their company, and after learning her father owes the company a substantial amount of money and that the company is apparently part of a mob-related conglomerate, she agrees to sign on with them. It turns out that AngelPro also works in the flesh peddling business, and under the guise of giving her a \\"new image\\", they begin to train Rina through public humiliation scenarios and outfits. Among these humiliations she is taken to a sex shop pretending to be a porn actress and masturbates in a porn cinema. Once her training has culminated, she's auctioned off at a BDSM auction as a sex slave for 580 million yen (roughly $5.9 million USD). Six months later she returns to her career as a singer. The manager and his assistant/slave are backstage, discussing how Rina turned out to be a good buy. In the backstage it is revealed her father had already died during her training. At the end of her performance, Rina strips and begins masturbating with her microphone before finally losing her mind. The representatives from AngelPro walk off, and Rina's manager collapses to the floor in disbelief. The final shot shows the all-male audience rushing the stage and crowding around her as she smiles vacantly, with a tear streaming down her cheek.

Living TV Group's advertising for all of its channels was handled by former sister company Interactive Digital Sales (IDS) until 1 January 2011, when Sky Media took over. History Flextech (1990‚Äì2000) Flextech, was formerly an oil services group, previously being floated as an energy investment company back in 1983. It was not until the arrival of chief executive Roger Luard in 1986 that its focus began to change and becoming a TV programme provider.

Roger Luard, chief executive officer said, \\"We are delighted to be involved with one of the United States' leading and most successful basic cable networks, and we look forward to co-operating with IFE in opportunities for expansion into Europe and beyond. The channel was announced as a Premier family entertainment network in the United Kingdom. Maidstone Studios, become the station operation base, which also benefited Flextech, as the facility operated the channels' uplink, playout and management operations. In the autumn talks, they were held with Tele- Communications Inc. (TCI- the Denver-based US cable TV giant). Under the original terms of the proposed deal, Flextech would have acquire TCI's European programming business in exchange for shares. By January 1994, the deal was complete with TCI which allowed TCI to acquire 60.4% of Flextech, while Flextech acquired 100% of Bravo, 25% of UK Gold, 31% of UK Living, and 25% of The Children's Channel which increased its share in that channel. In February 1994, Flextech shareholders approved a deal in which Flextech absorbs the European programming interests of United Artists European Holdings. In return, UAEH's US parent, TeleCommunications Inc (TCI), received 60 per cent of the enlarged Flextech. Within days of the deal, Flextech brought a 20% stake in HTV for ¬£27million. Chris Rowlands, HTV's chief executive, said \\"The deal was a tremendous opportunity for both companies. We will make programmes for Flextech and provide services for them which at the moment they have to buy in\\". Within a year, the stake was transferred to Scottish Television as part of its deal to acquire a 20% stake in Scottish Television. As part of the deal, Flextech agreed to license the rights to over 125 hours of the drama and documentary output from STV's library which entered into a production output agreement to commission television programmes from STV with a minimum total value of 6.0 million pounds over three years.

The deal come to nothing, but two years later, both companies agreed to allow Flextech's television channels to be broadcast on sky new digital platform. Flextech started to strengthen its portfolio when it acquired full control over The Family Channel and Maidstone Studios.

In 1996, it started discussions about increasing its stake to gain full control. At that point, Flextech held 27% with Cox (38%), BBC (20%) and Pearson (15%). By the Autumn, Flextech acquired Cox and Pearson stake thus give Flextech an 80% stake in UK Gold. During 1996, talks began between Flextech and the BBC about a partnership to launch a new range of entertainment channels which had access to the BBC's entire programme library. The deal was signed in March 1997 when the BBC and Flextech unveiled their new venture, which included BBC Showcase, an entertainment channel; BBC Horizon, documentaries; BBC Style, lifestyle; BBC Learning, for schools, and BBC Arena, for the arts, plus three other channels including BBC Sport, BBC Catch-Up, for repeats of popular programmes within days of their original transmission, and a TV version of Radio 1. Initially, it was assumed that the new channels would be BBC-branded but Flextech wanted the channels to have advertisements. The BBC argued that BBC-branded services in the UK should not carry advertising, and thought that this would undermine the rationale of the license fee in the UK. A compromise was reached when the BBC launched BBC Showcase and BBC Learning (later renamed BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge shortly before launch) on its own, with the remainder of the deal passing to BBC Worldwide. Eventually the concept of the BBC/Flextech channels led the launch of UKTV in September 1997, with BBC Horizon becoming UK Horizons, BBC Style becoming UK Style and BBC Arena becoming UK Arena. Also the concept of a television version of BBC Radio 1 was reused for the UK Play channel, which launched in October 1998, but became defunct in September 2002 and the concept of BBC Catch-Up was later reused for the channel Watch, which was launched in October 2008. The concept of a dedicated BBC Sport channel never materialised, however, it has been reused when BBC Parliament was temporarily replaced by a dedicated BBC Sport channel in the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Olympics, plus a range of dedicated BBC Sport channels was launched specifically for the 2012 Summer Olympics, plus there is a BBC Sport interactive channel that is available on Freeview channel 301 as a part of the BBC Red Button service. Flextech agreed to acquire Minotaur International for around $6.5 million in 1999 Minotaur International was responsible for international sales of most programmes commissioned by the network. In 2007, Target Entertainment Group acquired Minotaur International and formed strategic alliances with Virgin Media Television to act as their preferred distribution partner in 2007. In 1998, chief executive Roger Luard died, and Adam Singer becoming chief executive. In early December 1999, talks were convened about a merger between Telewest and Flextech, By 17 December 1999, the merger was agreed upon which created a ¬£10.5bn media giant with Telewest shareholders owning 80% of the new group and Flextech shareholders owned 20% The two companies fully merged on 19 April 2000. Telewest/NTL/Virgin (2000‚Äì09) Flextech continued to expand under Telewest ownership with UKTV continuing to expand its network of channels with the BBC, plus a new venture which saw a shopping channel come into operation in Autumn 2000. In 2003, Flextech restructured its marketing department with creative solutions put together by central in-house marketers who worked agencies including Banc and Karmarama. The new marketing strategy was also used as a forerunner for the company's newest channel Ftn which launched in January 2003 on the Freeview platform. This was followed by Living TV receiving a new on-screen look and additional channel Living 2 which specialised in reality and entertainment television. During the Spring of 2004, United Business Media and RTL, which both held shares in Five, held talks with Flextech about merging the advertising sales teams of Five and Flextech's channels together, but came to nothing. In 2005, Telewest, in preparation for its long-awaited merger with NTL, put Flextech up for sale as the companies agreed \\"a content provider\\" had no place within the merged operation. A lot of interest was generated by the sale which included RTL, Hallmark Channel, ITV, Time Warner and Viacom. It became clear the BBC had the right to veto any change in ownership of Flextech's stake in the UKTV joint venture, which led to further speculation that Flextech's assets may have ended up being split. NTL also complicated matters by stating it would be reluctant to see any of Flextech's channels in the hands of terrestrial broadcasters such as ITV or Five. The underlying fear is that a terrestrial broadcaster could use Flextech to bolster the digital terrestrial platform and its appeal to viewers. Commercial terrestrial players have found that the popularity of Freeview has worked to their advantage, as viewers have fewer channels to choose from than on pay-TV platforms. By September, nearly all the bidders had pulled out except for BSkyB, but later pulled out of the deal over number of fears including the Competition Commission investigating the sale. Media analysis at the time did not believe the sale was genuine, although five other bidders including RTL and ITV did mark an interest. Simon Duffy, NTL's chief executive, stated \\"Flextech remains a key focus\\". Shortly afterwards Flextech appointed Jonathan Webb to replace Lisa Opie as managing director; Jonathan Webb was responsible for moving Challenge away from its staple of game shows and axing Bravo's \\"laddism\\" strategy. In November 2006, NTL:Telewest began rebranding itself as Virgin Media. The group acquired Virgin Mobile in July, but went further by licensing the \\"Virgin\\" name, as they believed \\"Virgin Media would shake up the market by bringing the Virgin traditions of value-for-money, brilliant customer service and innovation to the world of entertainment and communications\\". As part of the rebrand, Flextech was also renamed as Richard Branson was keen to move into branded content and insisted that the Flextech business was retained as a condition of NTL buying Virgin Mobile and licensing the name. On 8 February 2007, Flextech was renamed Virgin Media Television as part of a larger re-branding exercise covering the whole of NTL:Telewest, Virgin Mobile and Virgin.net.  Sale to BSkyB  On 7 April 2009, Virgin Media formally began the sale of its content operation, issuing a sales memorandum for its Virgin Media Television unit and its ad sales division, IDS. It excluded its 50% stake in UKTV from the sale. Virgin Media sold its stake in UKTV, by then a portfolio of 10 pay-TV channels including Gold, Dave, Home, Watch, Yesterday and Good Food, in August 2011 to US-owned broadcaster Scripps Networks for ¬£339 million (about $504 million). Scripps was negotiating a deal to give BBC Worldwide the option of increasing its stake to a maximum of 60%, by using a combination of cash and an unspecified \\"package of digital rights\\" for UKTV. \\"The new agreement we are developing will bring benefits to UKTV's audiences in the way they can consume content and will help to sustain UKTV's track record of growth,\\" said BBC Worldwide chief executive John Smith. On 4 June 2010, British Sky Broadcasting and Virgin Media announced that they had reached an agreement for the acquisition by Sky of Virgin Media Television. The companies had, in parallel, agreed to enter into a number of agreements providing for the carriage of certain Sky standard and high-definition (HD) channels. Sky acquired VMtv for a total consideration of up to ¬£160 million in cash, with ¬£105 million paid on completion and the remainder paid following the regulatory process. The acquisition expanded Sky's portfolio of basic pay TV channels and eliminated the carriage fees it previously paid for distributing VMtv channels on its TV services. New carriage agreements secured wholesale distribution of Sky's basic channel line-up, including Sky1 and Sky Arts, and the VMtv channels, on Virgin Media's cable TV service. For an incremental wholesale fee, Virgin Media, for the first time, had the option of carrying any of Sky's basic HD channels, Sky Sports HD 1 and Sky Sports HD 2, and all Sky Movies HD channels. Virgin Media will make available through its on-demand TV service a range of content from Sky's basic and premium channels, including the VMtv channels. Virgin Media also gained access to red button interactive sports coverage and the opportunity to deliver selected standard definition programming over the internet. Sky would assume responsibility for selling advertising for the newly acquired VMtv channels from January 2011. Completion of the agreements was conditional on obtaining merger control clearance in the Republic of Ireland. Virgin1 was also a part of the deal, but was rebranded as Channel One on 3 September 2010, as the Virgin name was not licensed to Sky. Virgin Media's stake in UKTV was not included in the deal. On 29 June 2010, The Competition Authority in Ireland cleared the proposed transaction. The parties proceeded after the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation did not direct the Authority to carry out a full investigation within 10 days of the date of the Authority's decision. On 13 July 2010, British Sky Broadcasting and Virgin Media announced that Sky has completed the acquisition of Virgin Media Television (VMtv) following regulatory approval in the Republic of Ireland. VMtv was then renamed the Living TV Group. In completing the acquisition, Sky paid Virgin Media an initial ¬£105 million. Up to an additional ¬£55 million would be paid on UK regulatory clearance. On 20 July 2010, The Office of Fair Trading announced that they would review BSkyB's acquisition of the Virgin Media Television business to judge whether it posed any competition concerns in the UK. The OFT planned to investigate the deal to see whether it could constitute a qualifying merger under the Enterprise Act 2002. The watchdog invited interested parties from the industry to comment on the sale, including its potential impact on the pay-TV market. On 14 September 2010, The OFT decided not to refer BSkyB's takeover of Virgin Media's TV channels to the Competition Commission. Following the sale, BSkyB chose to integrate the Living TV Group into its own operations. This resulted in the closure of Bravo, Bravo 2, Challenge Jackpot on 1 January 2011 and Channel One on 1 February 2011. On 1 February 2011, Living, Livingit and Living Loves were rebranded as Sky Living, Sky Livingit and Sky Living Loves, while Challenge was added to Freeview, with the channels receiving a 25% boost to their programming budget. Fifty-two of the Living TV Group's 110 employees were made redundant as part of the process, including managing director ‚Äì Johnny Webb, director of television ‚Äì Claudia Rosencrantz and director of programmes for Channel One, Bravo and Challenge ‚Äì Daniela Neumann. The integration process was completed at the end of January 2011. Living TV Group channels Living TV Group directly operated a number of linear television channels. Most of the channels were formed in the Flextech years. Additionally, Living TV Group operated a high-definition channel and a number of time-shifted channels. All channels were available on satellite and cable television services. Channel One, was also available on Freeview.

It originally launched on 1 September 1993 as UK Living, but the channel later changed its name to Living in 1997, to disassociate itself from the UKTV network that launched that year. On 1 February 2011, Living was rebranded as Sky Living. In a bid to appeal to a more male audience, the pink colour scheme was dropped and new types of programming came to the channel, but at the same time not losing its female audience. Shows include the likes of the CSI, Close to Home and Boston Legal, the channel is now broadening its audience reach to other key demographics such as men aged 18‚Äì45. On 6 August 2018, Sky Living was rebranded as Sky Witness and was divested from Living TV Group, leaving only Challenge on the Living TV Group and bringing an end to the Living brand after 25 years. Defunct channels As Flextech, Living TV Group used to be interested in different markets from its current demographics which focus on an older age group. But in an attempt to streamline the business that was at the time suffering from falling ratings across these channels, they were made defunct. Due to the sale of Living TV Group to Sky, some channels were disposed of. =Bravo= Bravo was launched in 1985. The channel also had a one-hour timeshift named Bravo +1.

It drains a region in central and southern Texas southeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. It is the southernmost major river in Texas northeast of the Rio Grande. Nueces is Spanish for nuts; early settlers named the river after the numerous pecan trees along its banks. Location and flow The Nueces rises northwest of San Antonio in the Edwards Plateau, in Real County, roughly 50 mi (80 km) north of Uvalde. It flows south through the Texas Hill Country, past Barksdale and Crystal City, approaching to within 35 mi (56 km) of the Rio Grande on the border with Mexico. East of Carrizo Springs, it turns to the east, flowing through the scrub plains of South Texas, across rural Dimmit, La Salle, and McMullen Counties. In central Live Oak County, it is joined from the northwest at Three Rivers by the Atascosa River and Frio River, then flows southeast along the coastal plain past Mathis, where it is impounded to form the Lake Corpus Christi reservoir. It enters Corpus Christi Bay on the Gulf of Mexico at Corpus Christi. History Called Chotilapacquen by Coahuiltecan-speaking groups, the river was named \\"Nueces\\" by Alonso de Le√≥n referring to the abundant pecan tree groves. One of the first settlers to scout the area was Cpt. Blas Mar√≠a de la Garza Falc√≥n in 1766. From before the end of the Texas Revolution, Mexico recognized that the Nueces River was historically the border between Texas and the rest of the country. However, the Republic of Texas claimed the Rio Grande as its border with Mexico, citing the Treaty of Velasco signed by Mexican President Santa Anna, who had agreed to the Rio Grande border after having lost the Battle of San Jacinto. This contention continued after the annexation of Texas by the United States, and was one of the causes of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the dispute, with Mexico‚Äîwhile under American occupation‚Äîrecognizing the Rio Grande as its northern border. On August 10, 1862, pro-Union Germans from the Texas Hill Country trying to flee to Mexico were ambushed and killed by Confederates--the Nueces massacre. Fishing The Nueces is one of several clear, warm-water spring creeks in the Hill Country of Texas. In its upper reaches, the water is clear and cool. Unlike spring trout creeks in the Rocky Mountains, the Nueces holds largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and the native Guadalupe bass, along with a variety of panfish such as redbreast sunfish, rock bass, green sunfish, and Rio Grande perch. The American alligator is also abundant in the Nueces River.

Early life He was the son of John Thornton (1729‚Äì1790) of Clapham, London, who had been one of the early patrons of the evangelical movement in Britain. At the age of five, Henry attended the school of Mr Davis at Wandsworth Common, and later with Mr Roberts at Point Pleasant, Wandsworth. From 1778 he was employed in the counting house of his cousin Godfrey Thornton, two years later joining his father's company, where he later became a partner. Career In 1784 Thornton joined the banking firm of Down and Free of London, later becoming a partner of the company which became known as Down, Thornton and Free. It was under his direction that this became one of the largest banking firms in London, with regional offices in other British cities. In 1782 Henry Thornton had been urged to seek a seat in Parliament, and applied to contest one of the two seats for Hull. He soon withdrew on a point of principle, after learning that it was local custom to pay each voter two guineas in order to secure their vote. In September the same year Thornton was elected as member for Southwark, London. Despite lacking popular appeal, and refusing to bribe voters in a similar way to those of Hull, he became respected as a man of morals and integrity. As an independent MP, Thornton sided with the Pittites, and in 1783 voted for peace with America. In general he tended to support William Pitt, Henry Addington and the Whig administration of William Grenville and Charles Fox. He seldom spoke in the House of Commons, as much of his contribution was in the various parliamentary committees on which he sat. In 1795 he became the treasurer of the committee responsible for the publication of the Cheap Repository Tracts.Cheap Repository for Moral and Religious Publications, [London] J. Marshall, printer to the Cheap Repository, [1795?]. English Short- title Catalogue T030543. He served on committees to examine the public debt (1798), the Irish exchange (1804), public expenditure (1807) and the bullion committee (1810), which scrutinized the high price of gold, foreign exchange, and the state of the British currency. The report of the committee, written by Thornton, argued for the resumption of gold payments in exchange for notes and deposits, which the Bank of England (of which his elder brother, Samuel Thornton, was a director) had suspended in 1797, but the recommendation was not well received at the time, and gold redemption on demand was not restored until 1821. In the next few years he continued to press for these measures to be implemented, publishing two reports in 1811. This period 1797‚Äì1810 was a time of major change and great confusion in the British banking system, and the currency crisis of 1797 led to Thornton's greatest contribution as an economist, for which he is most remembered today. In 1802 he wrote An Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain, in which he set out to correct the view that the increase in paper credit was the principal cause of the economic ills of the day. This was a work of great importance, and gave a detailed account of the British monetary system as well as a detailed examination of the ways in which the Bank of England should act to counteract fluctuations in the value of the pound. Legacy A successful merchant banker, as a monetary theorist Thornton has been described as the father of the modern central bank. An opponent of the real bills doctrine, he was a defender of the bullionist position and a significant figure in monetary theory, his process of monetary expansion anticipating Knut Wicksell's theory of the Cumulative process. His work on 19th century monetary theory has won praise from present-day economists for his forward-thinking ideas, including Friedrich Hayek, who wrote an introduction to his 'An Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain', and John Maynard Keynes alike.Philippe Beaugrand, Henry Thornton, un pr√©curseur de J.M. Keynes, Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1981. Abolitionist and reformer Thornton was one of the founders of the Clapham Sect of evangelical reformers and a foremost campaigner for the abolition of the slave trade. A close friend and cousin of William Wilberforce, he is credited with being the financial brain behind their many campaigns for social reform and philanthropic causes which the group supported. For some years Thornton and Wilberforce shared a house called Battersea Rise which Thornton had bought in 1792. The cousins spent much time here co-coordinating their activities and entertaining their friends. After their marriages in 1796‚Äì97 they continued to live and work in close proximity for another decade. In 1791 Thornton played a major part in the establishment of the Sierra Leone Company, which took over the failed attempt by Granville Sharp to create a colony for the settlement of freed slaves in Africa. The company sponsored the voyage to London (1791‚Äì93) of the Temne prince John Naimbanna. As the company's foremost director, Thornton virtually administered the colony as chairman of the company until responsibility was transferred to the Crown in 1808. It was at this time that he became a friend of Zachary Macaulay, who was governor of the colony 1794‚Äì99. In 1802 Thornton was one of the founders of the Christian Observer, the Clapham Sect's journal edited by Zachary Macaulay, to which he contributed many articles. He was also involved in supporting the spread of Christian missionary work, including the founding of the Society for Missions to Africa and the East (later the Church Missionary Society) in 1799, and the British and Foreign Bible Society (now the Bible Society) in 1804, of which he became the first treasurer. A friend of Hannah More, he assisted in the writing and publication of her Cheap Repository tracts. In 1806, Thornton served as Manager of the newly formed London Institution. He was a pioneer of deaf education, setting up, with Rev John Townsend and Henry Cox Mason, rector of Bermondsey, Britain's first free school for deaf pupils, the London Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb. Its name and location changed over the centuries; The Royal School for Deaf Children Margate closed in 2015. Personal life In 1796 Thornton married Marianne Sykes (1765‚Äì1815), daughter of Joseph Sykes, a merchant from Hull. They had nine children. Both parents died in 1815 and the children were adopted by a family friend, Sir Robert Inglis.John Wolffe, 'Inglis, Sir Robert Harry, second baronet (1786‚Äì1855)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 5 Feb 2012 The eldest child, Marianne Thornton, was a bluestocking who lived in Clapham for most of her long life. She was the subject of a biography by her cousin, E.M. Forster (1879‚Äì1970), the novelist, who was one of Henry Thornton's great- grandchildren. The oldest son, Henry Sykes Thornton (1800‚Äì1881), succeeded his father in the banking business, but the firm was merged into Williams Deacon's Bank following the financial crisis of 1825‚Äì6. One of the younger daughters, Sophia Thornton, married John Leslie-Melville, 9th Earl of Leven). Another daughter, Isabella, in 1841 married the clergyman Benjamin Harrison who became a Canon of Canterbury and Archdeacon of Maidstone.W. H. Fremantle, 'Harrison, Benjamin (1808‚Äì1887)‚Äô, rev. George Herring, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 5 Feb 2012 Henry Thornton was buried at St Paul's Church, Clapham where a commemorative plaque records the fact, with an additional reference to the family vault nearby. A selection of photographs is displayed on the website of the former school named after him.http://www.oldthorntoniansclapham.org.uk Works * An Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain, 1802.

He first studied law and philosophy at the University of Berlin, but later studied painting and drawing in Weimar in 1869, in Paris in 1872, and in the Netherlands in 1876‚Äì77. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì71), Liebermann served as a medic with the Order of St. John near Metz. After living and working for some time in Munich, he finally returned to Berlin in 1884, where he remained for the rest of his life. He was married in 1884 to Martha Marckwald (1857‚Äì1943).Kunisch, Hermann (1985). \\"Liebermann, Max\\" . Neue Deutsche Biographie. Vol. 14.

He used his own inherited wealth to assemble an impressive collection of French Impressionist works. He later chose scenes of the bourgeoisie, as well as aspects of his garden near Lake Wannsee, as motifs for his paintings. In Berlin, he became a famous painter of portraits; his work is especially close in spirit to √âdouard Manet. In his work he steered away from religious subject matter, with one cautionary exception being an early painting, The 12-Year-Old Jesus in the Temple With the Scholars (1879). His painting of a Semitic- looking boy Jesus conferring with Jewish scholars sparked debate. At the International Art Show in Munich it stirred up a storm for its supposed blasphemy, with one critic describing Jesus as \\"the ugliest, most impertinent Jewish boy imaginable.\\" Noted for his portraits (he did more than 200 commissioned ones over the years, including of Albert Einstein and Paul von Hindenburg), Liebermann also painted himself from time to time. Self-Portrait, 1906, National Gallery of Art On the occasion of his 50th birthday, Liebermann was given a solo exhibition at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin, and the following year he was elected to the academy. From 1899 to 1911 he led the premier avant-garde formation in Germany, the Berlin Secession. In his various capacities as a leader in the artistic community, Liebermann spoke out often for the separation of art and politics. In the formulation of arts reporter and critic Grace Glueck he \\"pushed for the right of artists to do their own thing, unconcerned with politics or ideology.\\" His interest in French Realism was offputting to conservatives, for whom such openness suggested what they thought of as Jewish cosmopolitanism. He did contribute regularly to a newspaper put out by artists during World War I. In 1909 Liebermann bought property in Wannsee, a wealthy suburb of summer homes on the outskirts of Berlin, and designed a villa with gardens there. From the 1910s until his death, images of the gardens dominated his work. Liebermann recruited Lovis Corinth, Ernst Oppler and Max Slevogt for the Berlin Secession, together they were the most famous painters of the German Impressionism. Beginning in 1920 he was president of the Prussian Academy of Arts. On his 80th birthday, in 1927, Liebermann was celebrated with a large exhibition, declared an honorary citizen of Berlin and hailed in a cover story in Berlin's leading illustrated magazine. But such public accolades were short lived. In 1933 he resigned when the academy decided to no longer exhibit works by Jewish artists, before he would have been forced to do so under laws restricting the rights of Jews. While watching the Nazis celebrate their victory by marching through the Brandenburg Gate, Liebermann was reported to have commented: \\"Ich kann gar nicht soviel fressen, wie ich kotzen m√∂chte.\\" (\\"I could not possibly eat as much as I would like to throw up.\\"). His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Liebermann died on February 8, 1935, at his home on Berlin's Pariser Platz, near the Brandenburg Gate. According to K√§the Kollwitz, he fell asleep about 7 p.m. and was gone.K√§the Kollwitz: Die Tageb√ºcher 1908‚Äì1943. Hrsg. von Jutta Bohnke- Kollwitz. btb, M√ºnchen 2007. Eintrag vom 9. Februar 1935. Although Liebermann had been famous, his death was not reported in the media, now controlled by the Nazis, and there were no representatives of the Prussian Academy of Arts or the city at his funeral in the Jewish Cemetery on Sch√∂nhauser Allee. However, despite official strictures by the Gestapo, more than 100 friends and relatives attended the funeral.

The film is a sequel to Species (1995) and the second installment in the Species series. The film stars Natasha Henstridge, Michael Madsen, and Marg Helgenberger, all of whom reprise their roles from the first film. The plot has Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard), the astronaut son of a senator (James Cromwell), being infected by an extraterrestrial organism during a mission to Mars and causing the deaths of many women upon his return. To stop him, the scientists who created the human-extraterrestrial hybrid Sil in the original Species try using a more docile clone of hers, Eve (Henstridge). The film was theatrically released on April 10, 1998. It was both a commercial and a critical failure than its predecessor, only grossing $26.8 million. Despite this, a sequel Species III was released in 2004.  Plot  Commander Patrick Ross leads a manned mission to Mars. Soil samples collected by Patrick's team of astronauts unwittingly contain an alien-based substance which thaws aboard their capsule due to the temperature difference and contaminates them, causing a seven-minute contact gap with mission control. With seemingly no subsequent negative effects, the astronauts return to Earth to public celebration. Only an institutionalized former scientist, Dr. Cromwell, reacts to their return with violent panic. Meanwhile, Dr. Laura Baker has created a clone of Sil named Eve, whose alien DNA is suppressed to make her more docile. Her team conducts experiments on Eve, hoping to find a way to combat the alien species should it ever return to Earth. Every experiment is unsuccessful as Eve's biology adapts. Upon their return, Patrick and his team are told to refrain from sexual activity for ten days. Patrick disregards this advice and has a threesome with two sisters Marcy and Lucy following a fundraiser. During sex with Lucy, he begins to sprout tentacles. Lucy notices his transformation while she is stroking his body and is horrified at the sight of him, whereupon she tries to free herself from his clutches. She pleads with him to stop but he ignores her pleas as he proceeds to climax. Marcy and Lucy experience accelerated pregnancies, culminating when Patrick's half-alien children violently explode from their abdomens. Patrick hides his rapidly growing sons on the property of his father, Senator Judson Ross. Meanwhile when Patrick has sex, Eve experiences excitement. The next day, Patrick tells his father he cannot remember the previous night's events. Senator Ross indicates that he is aware of Patrick's behavior and tells him to focus on his political goals. Dr. Orinsky, one of the NASA scientists who examined Patrick, discovers something amiss about his blood sample and desperately tries to contact Cromwell. However, Orinsky is ambushed and disemboweled by something formed from Patrick's blood. Laura discovers that the DNA in Orinsky's wounds is distinct from Eve's, making her an unlikely culprit in the murder. This prompts Colonel Burgess, the military supervisor in charge of her project, to reunite her with Press Lennox to contain the new threat. Press and Laura seek out Cromwell, Orinsky's former professor, and learn that he discovered that the alien species had attacked and destroyed Mars in ancient times. Because of his fears that alien DNA might remain on Mars to infect anyone who visited the planet in the future, Cromwell urged the government to abort the mission, but was institutionalized to permanently silence him. Press and Laura identify the Mars astronauts as the prime suspects. Unable to find Patrick, they pursue the other astronauts, Anne Sampas and Dennis Gamble. They arrive too late to prevent Anne from having sex with her husband, resulting in her impregnation with hybrid offspring. A tentacle-like creature bursts from Anne's abdomen and kills her husband before Press and Laura manage to kill her. Meanwhile, a second team of agents locate and examine Dennis, but confirm he is not infected. Laura discovers that Anne's hybrid DNA does not match that in Orinsky's wounds, meaning Patrick is the killer. Meanwhile, Patrick has sex with his girlfriend, resulting in her death through the birth of another hybrid son. Horrified at causing her death, Patrick attempts suicide by shotgun, but the alien DNA regenerates his head and restores him back to life and temporarily killing his human side, with the drive to mate with as many women as possible. Dennis witnesses this and tells Press and Laura what he saw, remembering what happened in the capsule and joining them in their mission. Patrick begins impregnating as many women as he can, hiding his victims and up to twenty children on his father's property. Laura is ordered to activate Eve's alien DNA so she can telepathically track Patrick, but this makes her volatile and strengthens her alien instincts. Patrick surrenders to Press and Dennis after attempting to rape Darlene, whereupon he becomes aware of Eve; they take him to the lab despite their suspicion. As Patrick is taken to custody, Eve shows signs of being in heat. Patrick demands Laura open Eve's cell and nearly kills her when she refuses, but Press and Dennis drive him off with a special gaseous weapon. Burgess confronts Ross with irrefutable proof of Patrick's infection and demands help in detaining Patrick. Suspicious that Patrick will instead be killed, Ross deduces that he is at the property and apologizes for treating his son so coldly. Patrick's human side briefly returns, but while he tearfully embraces his father, the alien DNA violently reasserts itself and kills the Senator. Ross's death completely destroys Patrick's humanity, and he helps his hybrid children to cocoon, so they will soon begin mating themselves and prepare to eradicate humanity. Back at the lab, Laura discovers Dennis was not infected because he is a carrier of sickle-cell disease, as the species lacks immunity to human genetic diseases. While they plan to weaponize this weakness, Eve breaks out of her confinement to find Patrick. Press, Laura and Dennis pursue her, with Burgess and the military following. At the shed, they kill Patrick's offspring while Eve and Patrick transform into their alien forms and begin to mate. The mating stops when Press and Dennis intervene, allowing Eve to break free; Patrick, transformed into another alien form, overpowers Eve by forcing his tongue- tentacle down her throat, seemingly attacks her. Press impales him in the back with a pitchfork coated in Dennis' blood, causing Patrick to disintegrate and die. The military escorts Press, Laura and the injured Dennis away. Eve's lifeless body is loaded into an ambulance, but shortly after, her womb begins to swell rapidly‚Äîindicating her survival and impregnation by Patrick‚Äîwhile one of his youngest sons, who somehow survived, watches. As the screen cuts to black, Eve's uterus bursts and her screaming is heard.

He pitched an idea to executive Greg Foster where this time two hybrid alien women would strike. Foster liked it, but once Brancato went to Species producer Frank Mancuso Jr., he asked to \\"approach this from a different angle, so that we don't have a tired retread of the original, as sequels often are\\". So Brancato took inspiration from The Manchurian Candidate, where \\"somebody on a mission comes back, apparently a hero, but actually with some terrible demon inside\\", and as \\"the notion of a grand, unexplored place was the planet Mars\\", he made the first astronaut on Mars ‚Äì as according to NASA scientists consulted by Brancato, human exploration of Mars was \\"a possibility ‚Äì just a very expensive one\\" ‚Äì be infected by alien DNA. Mancuso approved the idea, and thus Brancato explored how this new villain was one \\"for whom we can briefly feel a strange, Wolf Man-like sympathy ‚Äì he's not responsible for having been turned into a monster\\" and had him face an alien woman similar to Sil, raising the doubt on whether they would battle or mate. As Natasha Henstridge was unconfirmed to return, Brancato wrote the new female, Eve, as if it was \\"either Natasha or a similarly beautiful woman\\". Henstridge still liked the script enough and the idea of working with director Peter Medak to sign for the sequel.All About Eve, Starlog 251 (June 1998) Brancato decided to bring back two of the surviving characters from Species, Michael Madsen's Press Lennox and Marg Helgenberger's Dr. Laura Baker feeling they \\"were essential to bring the audience back in\\", but knowing Forest Whitaker was probably too busy to return as Dan Smithson, he wrote a similar African American character in the one eventually portrayed by Mykelti Williamson. Mancuso had another script done simultaneously to Brancato's, which reportedly explored the cliffhanger at end of Species where a rat was infected after eating Sil's remains. Mancuso brought in to direct Peter Medak, responsible for the 1980 horror film The Changeling. The nature of the alien species is explored to a slightly greater extent in the second film. A professor claims that they originated in the Large Magellanic Cloud (also called the Magellanic Galaxy), due to it apparently being the only other place carbon-based life forms have been discovered. It is also stipulated that they were a \\"cancerous\\" race that visited Mars millions of years ago and annihilated all life on its surface (which is described in the film as being Earth-like at that time) before leaving a remnant of their own DNA in its soil. This DNA was intended to be picked up by other visitors so that their species could continue to infect other inhabited planets. The Species basically appear to be bipedal (humanoid) forms. Unlike other aliens in the Species series, however, Patrick Ross has two types of alien forms: Mating form and combat form. Patrick's alien form for copulation is bipedal, humanoid, and male version of Eve's. While Patrick's alien form for combat (so-called 'Fighting Patrick') is quadrupedal, bigger, and more 'brutish' in appearance than Eve. His second stage appearance is also similar to the xenomorphs of the Alien films; both were designed with input from H. R. Giger.  Reception   Box office  On April 10, 1998 in 2510 theatres, the film finished at $7.2 million, ranking number four on its opening weekend. Domestically, the film grossed only $19.6 million from its $35 million budget and $26,817,565 overseas, making the film average at the box office and therefore was a major critical and commercial failure.  Critical response  The film received worse reviews than its predecessor. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 9% at based on 33 reviews; the critical consensus reads \\"Clumsily exploitative and sloppily assembled, Species II fails to clear the rather low bar set by its less-than-stellar predecessor\\". On Metacritic the film has a score of 19% based on reviews from 13 critics.https://www.metacritic.com/movie/species-ii Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C\\" on an A+ to F scale. At the 1998 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film was nominated for Worst Sequel but lost to I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. Dwayne E. Leslie from Box Office Magazine gave the film 1 out of 5 stars calling it \\"a sequel that doesn't measure up\\", also heavily criticizing the film's predictable and open ending.Species II review Boxoffice.com Joe Leydon from Variety magazine called the film \\"a half-baked rehash\\". He praised the special effects and technical aspects of the film but added \\"that's not nearly enough to camouflage the inherent crumminess.\\"Species II review Variety.com James Berardinelli described the film as awful but added \\"there's enough blood, gore, simulated sex, and bare flesh to prevent it from ever becoming boring\\".Species II review Reelviews.net In a 2004 interview, co-star Michael Madsen expressed his opinion on this film saying \\"Species II was a crock of shit. There are a number I'm not very proud of. The movie studios can't mind that much, as they haven't contacted me to tell me off about it. I'm honest ‚Äì if I've made a bad movie, I want my fans to know what they're letting themselves in for.\\" In the DVD commentary director Peter Medak praised the films' special effects. He expressed his opinion that audiences had too much expectation as this was a very different sequel due to not continuing from the story with the alien- infected rat that survived the finale, which hinted at a sequel in the 1995 original. Medak also admitted being uncomfortable with the amount of nudity in the film but said it was for the purpose of the story.  Merchandise  To coincide with the movie, McFarlane Toys released an Eve and Patrick (in their alien form) action figure as part of their inaugural series of Movie Maniacs action figures. Both action figures came with a replica of the film's poster with skulls and bones base. Eve came with an alternate head. Two Eve action figures were produced which was dubbed the PG and R rated version. The R rated Eve action figure (in her alien form) had nipples on her breasts while the PG figure didn't. The R rated figure was released only in comic book and other collectable stores while the PG figure was released in toy stores. Another thing noticeable about the figures was their facial expressions.  Novelization  As with the first film, Yvonne Navarro wrote a novelization based on the original screenplay which gives plot and character details not seen in the film. For example, the book tells how, due to limited knowledge of the outside world, Eve does not know if Superman is a real life personality or not. It is also hinted that she was able to learn a degree of martial arts by watching old action movies. In the film, Eve is shot by soldiers, but after being briefly incapacitated her body regenerates and she continues to escape. Soldiers continue to shoot at her, but Eve manages to run past them; why she is unharmed is left unexplained. The book explains that her skin adapts (in a way similar to how her body adapts to the gas test earlier in the film), becoming bulletproof. Other details in the book that do not appear in the film include an earlier escape attempt by Eve and Patrick discovering new senses in a restaurant with his fianc√©. In the novel, the debutante is a young, sexy, brown-eyed blonde, whereas in the film, she is an older woman who is a brunette. The debutante's sister in the novel isn't her sister but her best friend from college that often engaged in sexual games that involved seducing men. Other events that occurred in the novel that occurred in the movie happened before or after other events. For example, Patrick does not encounter the debutante at the fundraiser until after Orinsky is killed by him, and Cromwell is not visited by Laura and Press until they discover Orinsky's corpse.

On December 7, 1863, Confederate sympathizers from the Maritime Provinces captured the American steamer Chesapeake off the coast of Cape Cod. The expedition was planned and led by Vernon Guyon Locke (1827‚Äì1890) of Nova Scotia and John Clibbon Brain (1840‚Äì1906).Locke was born in Sandy Point, Shelburne County, Nova Scotia, in 1827. At the advent of the rebellion, Locke offered his services to the South. He secured his ship Retribution letter of marque. His alias was John Parker to cover his privateering activities (See Marquis, p.136). When George Wade of New Brunswick killed one of the American crew, the Confederacy claimed its first fatality in New England waters.Marquis, p. 143 The Confederate sympathizers had planned to re-coal at Saint John, New Brunswick, and head south to Wilmington, North Carolina.Hoy, p. 180 Instead, the captors had difficulties at Saint John; so they sailed further east and re-coaled in Halifax, Nova Scotia. U.S. forces responded to the attack, violating British sovereignty by trying to arrest the captors in Nova Scotian waters. International tensions rose. Wade and others were able to escape through the assistance of William Johnston Almon, a prominent Nova Scotian and Confederate sympathizer. The Chesapeake Affair was one of the most sensational international incidents that occurred during the American Civil War.Hoy, p. 179 The incident briefly threatened to bring the British Empire into the war against the North.Hoy, p. 182  Historical context  While slavery had effectively ended in Nova Scotia at the beginning of the 19th century, the British ended the practice of slave-owning throughout its Empire by the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 (except in India, where it was part of traditional society).Hoy, p. 204 When the Civil War began, most Canadians and Maritimers were overtly sympathetic to the North, which had abolished slavery after the Revolution and which had trading ties.Hoy, p. vi At the beginning of the war, approximately 20,000 men from British North America, almost half of them Maritimers, crossed the border to fight, primarily for the North.Hoy, p. 130 Many families had strong kinship ties across the border with people in New England, New York and some of the Midwest. As the war went on, relations between Britain and the North became strained for numerous reasons, and sympathy turned toward the South. Britain declared itself neutral during the war. Increased trade went through Halifax to both Northern and Southern ports. Nova Scotia's economy thrived throughout the war. This trade created strong ties between Halifax and merchants from both the North and South. In Halifax the main commercial agent for the Confederacy was Benjamin Wier and Co. ‚Äì a company that flew the Confederate flag outside its office and accepted Confederate currency.Hoy, p. 185; Marquis, p. 169 The informal headquarters for the Confederates was located at the Waverley Hotel, 1266 Barrington Street (present-day Waverley Inn).Hoy, p. 257 At the same time, Halifax became the leading supplier of coal and fish to the North.Hoy, p. 256; The Waverley Hotel used to be at the corner of Barrington and Blowers streets. While trade with the South was flourishing, the North created a naval blockade to prevent supplies getting to the South. Hundreds of Blockade runners would use the port of Halifax to ship their goods between Britain and the Confederate States.Hoy, p. 254 Much of the coal and other fuels used to run Confederate steamers went through Halifax.Hoy, p.255 Canadians and Maritimers became fearful of the power that the North demonstrated in defeating the South, and worried that it might want to annex British North America next. Toronto, Montreal, St. Catharines, and Halifax were centers of a well-financed network of Confederate spies, escaped prisoners, and soldiers of fortune who were trying to influence government opinion in the war.Hoy, p.vii The Confederates arranged various attacks on the south from Canada, such as the raid on St. Albans, Vermont. The plan to kill President Abraham Lincoln was made in the St. Lawrence Hall hotel in Montreal.Hoy, p.viii The Chesapeake Affair was the result of a plan created in Saint John, New Brunswick, by Confederate sympathizers: they intended to capture an American ship and use it as a blockade runner for the South.Marquis, p. 147  Capture  Ella and Annie John C. Braine Locke had arranged for John C. Braine and sixteen Confederate sympathisers from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to board the Chesapeake as normal passengers while in New York.(Hoy, p.179, Marquis, p. 144) While en route to Maine, on the night of December 7, just off the coast of Cape Cod, Brain and the others commandeered the vessel. In the exchange of gunfire that took place, the ship's second engineer was killed, and three crew wounded.Hoy, p. 181 After seizing the vessel, Locke took command at Grand Manan Island. Neutrality regulations forbade the bringing of prizes into British waters.Marquis, p. 153 Locke sailed the Chesapeake to Saint John, New Brunswick as planned but was unable to load coal for the voyage south. He next took it to Nova Scotia. They stopped at Shelburne (Dec 10) and at Conquerall Bank, Nova Scotia on the LaHave River (Dec 14), where they loaded some coal. During the next two days, they sold some of the stolen cargo for supplies.Marquis, p. 154 In the meantime, two Union warships, the fast side-wheeler Ella and Annie, moving south from Halifax, and the , coming north from Shelburne, were closing in.Hoy, p. 184 The Chesapeake was nearly caught by the Ella and Annie on the LaHave River. Under the cover of night, the Chesapeake turned all lights out and slipped behind Spectacle Island and out on the LaHave without being detected.Hoy, 185; Marquis, p.157 The Chesapeake again avoided capture at Lunenburg and traveled on to Halifax.Hoy, p. 185 The vessel moved through Mahone Bay. At St. Margarets Bay it let some crew leave the ship. By December 16, the ship arrived at Mud Cove harbour at Sambro. Once there Locke went to Halifax overland; he arranged for a schooner come to Sambro to load coal. While the Chesapeake was being loaded with coal, the Ella and Annie and the Dacotah arrived.Hoy, p. 186, Marquis, p. 162  Arrest  Upon the arrival of the American warships, most of the crew of the Chesapeake fled. Lieutenant Nickels of the Ella and Annie violated British sovereignty and international laws by arresting the three men who remained: one from New Brunswick and two from Nova Scotia. George Wade, who had killed a crew member during the raid, was among the prisoners. The Americans took the Chesapeake to Halifax to get clearance for their actions from the British authorities.Hoy, p. 187 The Chesapeake arrived in Halifax on December 17, under the escort of the two American warships. Three other warships followed, which had also pursued the Chesapeake.Marquis, p. 164 (These included the , , and the .)Marquis, p. 166 U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward told the British that he wanted the Chesapeake returned immediately and the captives put in jail and extradited to the states.  Escape  William Johnston Almon William Johnston Almon was generally regarded as the unofficial Confederate consul in Halifax.Hoy, p. 192 He constantly harboured Confederate \\"refugees\\" and hosted numerous prominent Confederate officials, who were automatically welcomed at Rosebank during their stay in town. He was a friend and correspondent of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. He worked with Alexander Keith, Jr. to free the Confederates. The fate of the Chesapeake awaited adjudication in the colonial Admiralty court, but the British planned to give Confederate prisoner Wade to the United States authorities for extradition.Hoy, p. 193 Almon and Keith arranged for Wade's escape in a rowboat to Ketch Harbour and to Hantsport.Hoy, p. 194 The Americans were outraged and, in response, the British put a warrant out for the rest of his crew.Hoy, p. 199 A few of the crew were tried but were found not guilty on a technicality.Hoy, p.204  Aftermath  While the Southern sympathisers believed they were engaging in an act of war because they had an official letter of marque from the Confederacy, as the investigation into the affair unfolded, it was found their letter had no legal basis. As a result, rather than the Chesapeake Affair being an official act of war, it was an act of piracy and condemned as such by most of the newspapers in the Maritimes.Marquis, p. 148 Many high-ranking Confederates migrated North, settling in Canada after the war. In Halifax approximately 30 senior Naval and Army officers from the South settled in the city. Among the most prominent were John Wilkinson (commander of the CSS Chickamauga), Thomas Edgeworth Courtenay, and John Taylor Wood.Hoy, 259, 263  See also  * Military history of Nova Scotia  References  ;Primary texts * Hoy, Claire.

Due to the use of make-up and costumes early in their career and their widespread popularity, they are considered one of the most successful and influential bands in the visual kei movement. Throughout the mid-1990s they used significantly less make-up, and after a one-year break in 1997, came back with a more mainstream alternative rock style and toned down their on-stage attire. They disbanded in 2000. In 2003, HMV Japan ranked Luna Sea at number 90 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts. Initially founded in 1986, by bassist J and rhythm guitarist Inoran while in high school, the band was originally called Lunacy. In 1989 they recruited lead guitarist Sugizo, drummer Shinya and vocalist Ryuichi, a lineup that has remained the same. They released a few demo tapes prior to renaming themselves Luna Sea and releasing their self-titled debut album in 1991. The band achieved their breakthrough success with a sold-out tour in 1991, which helped them get a contract with MCA Victor, and with the release of their second album Image (1992), which reached number nine on the Oricon music chart. Following the critically acclaimed albums Eden (1993), Mother (1994) and Style (1996), the band switched to Universal in 1998 and released their best-selling studio album, Shine. In late 2000, after their seventh studio album Lunacy, Luna Sea disbanded. Luna Sea reunited for a one-off reunion concert in 2007 at the Tokyo Dome, and again in 2008 for the hide memorial summit. In 2010 the group officially reunited and held a world tour, and three years later they released their first new album in thirteen years, A Will. Their ninth album, Luv, followed four years later in 2017. At the end of 2019, their tenth album Cross co-produced by Steve Lillywhite became their first to top Billboard Japan. History 1986‚Äì1991: Formation and debut album The band's logotype, used since 1991. High school friends, Jun \\"J\\" Onose and Kiyonobu \\"Inoran\\" Inoue founded a band called Lunacy in 1986. Three years later on January 16, 1989, they recruited drummer Shinya Yamada from the band Pinoccio, who insisted that his bandmate Yasuhiro \\"Sugizo\\" Sugihara also join. As J was already the bass player and Inoran preferred to play rhythm guitar, Sugizo switched from bass guitar to lead guitarist. Vocalist Ryuichi Kawamura (then called \\"Rayla\\") from the band Slaughter joined on May 6, finalizing the group's lineup. Lunacy debuted on stage at the 100-seat capacity Play House in Machida, Tokyo on May 29, 1989. They released their first demo tape, \\"Lunacy\\", on August 9, with all one hundred copies sold out.

Essentially a television music festival featuring live remotely recorded performances to elicit monetary donations, over 25 artists participated, including Ellegarden, Char, Koda Kumi, and 9mm Parabellum Bullet. Musical style and influence Luna Sea formed at the end of the 1980s, when American and British glam metal were gradually losing popularity to alternative rock and grunge at the beginning of the 1990s. However, Japan's original rock groups were late following the Western trend, and as such Luna Sea formed when bands of the visual kei movement, Japan's answer to glam, were finally being recognized and achieving mainstream success. In the early 1990s, while still an indie band, the group's musical style was punk rock with gothic and even some hardcore punk tendencies. According to Alexey Eremenko of Allmusic, Luna Sea's sound is \\"firmly based in '80s hard rock, with a versatile progressive approach to songwriting, and its softer side, displayed later on in the group's career, proved equally strong.\\" The members' individual music backgrounds also influenced the band's style; as children, Sugizo and Shinya mastered the violin and the traditional taiko drums respectively. They also preferred different genres of music, as Ryuichi and Shinya had a tendency for pop, while Inoran, J and Sugizo loved heavier rock. Sugizo liked England's indie music culture, while J preferred the American rock scene. As for native Japanese bands, Dead End had particular influence on the group in the beginning, with Ryuichi being vocally and visually inspired by their frontman Morrie. Luna Sea and X Japan, despite their different musical styles, have had a close professional and personal relationship since the early 1990s. Several Luna Sea songs feature the violin played by Sugizo. Luna Sea's musical catalog encompasses songs in a diverse range of musical styles, including punk and post-punk (e.g. \\"Precious...\\", \\"D√©j√†vu\\", \\"Jesus\\"), gothic rock (e.g. \\"Moon\\", \\"Lastly\\"), hard rock (e.g. \\"Storm\\", \\"Hurt\\"), alternative rock (e.g. \\"True Blue\\", \\"Gravity\\"), progressive rock (e.g. \\"Genesis of Mind ~Yume no Kanata e~\\", \\"1999\\") and ballads (e.g. \\"Breathe\\", \\"Love Song\\"). Some of the band's songs also feature the violin, played by Sugizo (e.g. \\"Providence\\", \\"Mother\\"). They also wrote longer tracks, such as the nine and ten-minute long ballads \\"Forever & Ever\\" and \\"Virgin Mary\\", and the twenty-three-minute \\"The One -Crash to Create-\\". The majority of the band's lyrics are in Japanese, but usually all songs include some English words or lines. While all lyrics and songwriting has been credited to Luna Sea as a whole since 1993, over the years the member who originally composed specific songs have been revealed by the band or otherwise learned. Lyrics are almost exclusively written by Ryuichi, whose music contributions are limited to \\"Until the Day I Die\\", \\"Lost World\\" and \\"Anagram\\". The majority of songs are originally composed by J, Inoran or Sugizo, with Shinya's only compositions being \\"Inside You\\", \\"Echo\\", and \\"Millennium\\", the last written with Sugizo. When asked if there was a message in their songs, Sugizo stated that there is no reason for Luna Sea to give a political message, only to create music that will stimulate the imagination and act as \\"a catalyst for realistic feedback.\\" He also stated that his own guitar sound developed from trying to get the \\"psychedelic feel of shoegaze bands\\" in songs such as \\"Wish\\", \\"Rosier\\" and \\"Storm\\". In Luna Sea, he personally attempts to \\"express all that psychedelica, house and drug culture in a rock, guitar-band format.\\" When writing material, all the band members live together temporarily before they enter the studio to record. Up until 2019's Cross, they produced all of their music themselves, never working with a record producer. Many newer bands and artists, most being visual kei acts, have been influenced by Luna Sea. Eremenko wrote that they \\"had an impact on literally hundreds of bands that followed in their wake in the next decade.\\" Acts that cite them as an influence or look up to them include Miyavi, Mucc, D, Shinno of Nogod, members of Alice Nine, T≈çru Kawauchi of 12012, Kei and Denka from Dio ‚Äì Distraught Overlord, Aki of Sid, Makoto of Œõucifer, Kazuno, Touya and Ruka of Charlotte, Silver Ash leader Ling, Hazuki of Lynch. and Deathgaze, Dazzle Vision's Takuro, several members of Nightmare, Akiya from Kagrra, and all five members of The Gazette.

Kra drummer Yasuno has said that he started playing drums because of Shinya, and their former guitarist Mai is also a fan of both Sugizo and Inoran.

Corinth studied in Paris and Munich, joined the Berlin Secession group, later succeeding Max Liebermann as the group's president. His early work was naturalistic in approach. Corinth was initially antagonistic towards the expressionist movement, but after a stroke in 1911 his style loosened and took on many expressionistic qualities. His use of color became more vibrant, and he created portraits and landscapes of extraordinary vitality and power. Corinth's subject matter also included nudes and biblical scenes.  Early life  Group of Friends by Lovis Corinth (1904), Albertinum, Dresden Self-portrait with Skeleton, 1896, oil on canvas, 66 x 86 cm, St√§dtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus Corinth was born Franz Heinrich Louis on 21 July 1858 in Tapiau, in Prussia. The son of a tanner, he displayed a talent for drawing as a child. In 1876 he went to study painting in the academy of K√∂nigsberg. Initially intending to become a history painter, he was dissuaded from this course by his chief instructor at the academy, the genre painter Otto G√ºnther.Makela In 1880 he traveled to Munich, which rivaled Paris as the avant-garde art center in Europe at the time. There he studied briefly with Franz von Defregger before gaining admission to the Academy of Fine Arts Munich, where he studied under Ludwig von L√∂fftz. The realism of Corinth's early works was encouraged by L√∂fftz's teaching, which emphasized careful observation of colors and values. Other important influences were Courbet and the Barbizon school, through their interpretation by the Munich artists Wilhelm Leibl and Wilhelm Tr√ºbner . Except for an interruption for military service in 1882‚Äì83, Corinth studied with L√∂fftz until 1884. He then traveled to Antwerp, where he greatly admired the paintings of Rubens, and then in October 1884 to Paris where he studied under William-Adolphe Bouguereau and Tony Robert-Fleury at the Acad√©mie Julian.Corinth, Schuster, Vitali, & Butts 1996, p. 12. He concentrated especially on improving his drawing skills, and made the female nude his frequent subject. He was disappointed, however, in his repeated failure to win a medal at the Salon, and returned to K√∂nigsberg in 1888 when he adopted the name \\"Lovis Corinth\\".Corinth, Schuster, Vitali, & Butts 1996, p. 13. Career In 1891, Corinth returned to Munich, but in 1892 he abandoned the Munich Academy and joined the Munich Secession. In 1894 he joined the Free Association, and in 1899 he participated in an exhibition organized by the Berlin Secession. These nine years in Munich were not his most productive, and he was perhaps better known for his ability to drink large amounts of red wine and champagne. Corinth moved to Berlin in 1900, and had a one-man exhibition at a gallery owned by Paul Cassirer. In 1902 at the age of 43, he opened a school of painting for women and married his first student, Charlotte Berend, some 20 years his junior. Charlotte was his youthful muse, his spiritual partner, and the mother of his two children. She had a profound influence on him, and family life became a major theme in his art. Another of his students was Doramaria Purschian. He published numerous essays on art history, and in 1908 published Das Erlernen der Malerei (\\"On Learning to Paint\\").Corinth, Schuster, Vitali, & Butts 1996, p. 16. In December 1911, he suffered a stroke, and was partially paralyzed on his left side. Thereafter he walked with a limp, and his hands displayed a chronic tremor.Holland Cotter (12 June 1992), German Artist Haunted By a Threatening World New York Times. With the help of his wife, within a year he was painting again with his right hand. His disability inspired in the artist an intense interest in the simple, intimate things of daily life. In the summer of 1919, for example, he produced a cycle of casual etchings of his family in their country home. It was also at this time that landscapes became a significant part of his oeuvre. These landscapes were set at the Walchensee, a lake in the Bavarian Alps where Corinth owned a house. Their lively picturing, in bright colors, tempt many to consider the Walchensee series as his best work. From 1915-25, he served as President of the Berlin Secession.Corinth, Schuster, Vitali, & Butts 1996, p. 19. In 1920 an anthology of his art-historical writings was published in Berlin.Corinth, Schuster, Vitali, & Butts 1996, p. 20. In 1922 his works were exhibited in the Venice Biennale.Corinth, Schuster, Vitali, & Butts 1996, p. 21. The Artist and His Family, 1909, oil on canvas, Nieders√§chsisches Landesmuseum, Hanover Printmaking Corinth explored every print technique except aquatint; he favored drypoint and lithography. He created his first etching in 1891 and his first lithograph in 1894. He experimented with the woodcut medium but made only 12 woodcuts, all of them between 1919 and 1924.Corinth, Schuster, Vitali, & Butts 1996, p. 369. He was quite prolific, and in the last 15 years of his life he produced more than 900 graphic works, including 60 self-portraits. The landscapes he created between 1919 and 1925 are perhaps the most desirable images of his entire graphic oeuvre. He painted numerous self-portraits, and made a habit of painting one every year on his birthday as a means of self-examination.Corinth, Schuster, Vitali, & Butts 1996, p. 142. In many of his self-portraits he assumed guises such as an armored knight (The Victor, 1910), or Samson (The Blinded Samson, 1912).Corinth, Schuster, Vitali, & Butts 1996, pp. 41‚Äì42. A self-portrait of 1924 is in the Museum of Modern Art, New York City. Not all of Corinth's works were appreciated in his lifetime: upon learning of his death, Danish critic Georg Brandes wrote in a letter to his secretaryRung, Gerda, p. 211 that it was Corinth's ‚Äúpunishment for such a wretched portrait of myself‚Äù.Portrait of Georg Brandes Honors and death On 15 March 1921 Corinth received an honorary doctorate from the University of K√∂nigsberg. In 1925, he traveled to the Netherlands to view the works of his favorite Dutch masters. He caught pneumonia and died in Zandvoort. Legacy In 1926, a commemorative exhibition of Corinth's paintings and watercolors was presented at the Nationalgalerie in Berlin, and an exhibition of his prints and drawings was held at the Berlin Academy.Corinth, Schuster, Vitali, & Butts 1996, p. 22. By 1930 the Nationalgalerie acquired several major paintings by Corinth in addition to those already in its collection.Corinth, Schuster, Vitali, & Butts 1996, p. 23. During the Third Reich, Corinth's work was condemned by the Nazis as degenerate art. In 1937, Nazi authorities removed 295 of his works from public collections, and transported seven of them to Munich where they were displayed in March 1937 in the Degenerate Art Exhibition.Corinth, Schuster, Vitali, & Butts 1996, pp. 23‚Äì24. In 1910 Corinth had donated the painting Golgatha for the altar of the church of his birthplace, Tapiau. At the end of the Second World War, when the Red Army invaded East Prussia, this painting disappeared without trace. Tapiau was among the few East Prussian places not devastated by the war, which makes it likely that the painting was looted rather than destroyed. In 2007, the German city of Hanover returned a painting by Corinth to the heirs of Jewish collector Curt Glaser who sold it in 1933 to fund his escape from the Nazis. The painting, Romische Campagna (Roman Landscape) (1914) was handed to Glaser's heirs, represented by his U.S.-based niece and her daughter.1914 painting is returned to heirs Los Angeles Times, 25 September 2007. The house where Corinth was born is still in the town, which is now Gvardeysk, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia.

He worked endlessly to end the slave trade and to Christianize and improve the world. Early life Macaulay was born in Inveraray, Scotland, the son of Margaret Campbell and the Rev. John Macaulay (1720‚Äì1789), minister in the Church of Scotland, grandson of D√≤mhnall Cam.Notes of Family History He had two brothers, Rev. Aulay Macaulay, scholar and antiquary, and Colin Macaulay, General, slavery abolitionist and campaigner. Receiving a rudimentary education, he eventually taught himself Greek and Latin, and read the English classics. Having worked in a merchant's office in Glasgow, he fell into bad company and began to indulge in excessive drinking. Career In late 1784, at the age of 16, to get his life into some kind of order, Macaulay emigrated to Jamaica, where he worked as an assistant manager at a sugar plantation. He was at first deeply affected by the violence of the slavery which surrounded him, and, eventually as a result of his disgust at the sight of people being kept in wilful ignorance, at the age of 24 (according to \\"Life and Letters of Macaulay\\" by G.O. Trevelyan Volume 1 pages 21‚Äì23) threw up the position (against the wishes of his father) and returned to Britain. He was a good worker, had successfully moderated his drinking, and proved himself to be a model bookkeeper. He also, eventually, began to take an interest in the slaves and their welfare. In 1789 Macaulay returned to Britain and secured a position in London. His sister Jean had married Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, a country gentleman and ardent evangelical, and soon after Macaulay went to stay with them he began to come under their influence. He underwent what he described as a conversion experience and soon came to know Babington's associates, among whom were William Wilberforce and Henry Thornton. Sierra Leone Partly because of his experiences in Jamaica, in 1790 Macaulay was invited to visit Sierra Leone, the west African colony founded by the Sierra Leone Company to provide a home for emancipated slaves from the United States who came to Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia. Returning to the colony in 1792 as one of the council members, he was promoted to governor in 1794, and was the longest- serving governor of Freetown during the 1790s. An unpopular governor, Macaulay remained as governor until 1799. Family Macaulay married Selina Mills, daughter of Thomas Mills, a Quaker printer of Bristol. The couple had been introduced to each other by Hannah More on 26 August 1799, who later, with her sister, attempted to frustrate their courtship. They settled in Clapham, Surrey. They had several children, including * Thomas Babington Macaulay the historian, poet and politician. * Hannah More Macaulay (1810‚Äì1873) who married Sir Charles Trevelyan and was the mother of Sir George Otto Trevelyan Abolitionist Macaulay became a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, working closely with William Wilberforce, and soon becoming a leading figure in the parliamentary campaign against the slave trade. He later became secretary of the committee, which became known as the African Institution. His major contribution was to work on the collection and collating of the huge volume of evidence and drafting of reports of things not worth any sort of value‚Äì a role to which he was ideally suited as a skilled statistician with a meticulous approach and an exceptional head for figures. He also became a member of the Clapham Sect of evangelical Protestant reformers, together with Wilberforce, Henry Thornton and Edward Eliot, and edited their magazine, the Christian Observer, from 1802 to 1816. In the 1820s Macaulay turned his attention towards securing the total abolition of slavery itself. He helped found the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery (later the Anti-Slavery Society) in 1823, and was editor of its publication, the Anti-Slavery Reporter. In a series of letters to the Anti- Slavery Reporter, Zachary Macaulay condemned the philosophy of Colonel Thomas Moody, Knight, who was the Parliamentary Commissioner for West Indian slavery. In 1827, Macaulay's son, Thomas Babington Macaulay published an anti-slavery essay, in the Edinburgh Review, in which he also condemned Moody's philosophy.Thomas Babington Macaulay, Social and Industrial Capacities of the Negroes (Edinburgh Review, March 1827), collected in Critical, Historical and Miscellaneous Essays, Volume 6 (1860), pp.361‚Äì404. Through his diligent work, Zachary Macaulay he helped to lay the foundation for the eventual abolition of slavery throughout the British Empire, which occurred in 1833. Organiser Macaulay was an indefatigable organiser. He served on committees that established London University and the Society for the Suppression of Vice. A fellow of the Royal Society, he was also an active supporter of the British and Foreign Bible Society the Cheap Repository Tracts and the Church Missionary Society. Death After a period of ill health, Macaulay died in London on 13 May 1838. A memorial to him was erected in Westminster Abbey, depicting the figure of a kneeling slave with the motto 'Am I not a Man and a Brother?' He is buried in St George's Gardens, Bloomsbury.

A squeegee man or squeegee woman, squeegee kid (Canada), squeegee boy (Baltimore), squeegee punk (Montreal), squeegee merchant (London) or squeegee bandit is a person who, using a washcloth and squeegee, wipes windshields of cars stopped in traffic, in exchange for money. By country Canada In Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, and Winnipeg they are known as squeegee kids and they are mostly tolerated, since they are considered to be working for money, rather than begging. In Montreal they are often called squeegee punks, in reference to their appearance, or simply squeegees. Video of squeegee punks in the streets of Montreal. In 1999 the Ontario government passed the Safe Streets Act, outlawing squeegee kids and aggressive public begging. The Government of British Columbia has adopted a word for word version of Ontario Safe Street Act. Squeegee kids have become scarce in Toronto, Ontario and Vancouver, BC curb sides, as police frequently stop them and check their identities for outstanding arrest warrants. In 2011, then Deputy Mayor of Toronto Doug Holyday told the Toronto Sun that there was the will in council to step up action against panhandlers, including squeegee kids; the proposition was mocked by some media, given the previous efforts, and the suggestion that the homeless would have to pay fines. United Kingdom Londoners, and perhaps others, extend the appellation to include those who roam in the midst of stopped traffic to not only wash windscreens, but also hawk items such as roses and newspapers. For this reason, they are sometimes called squeegee merchants. United States In New York City in the 1980s, the usual procedure would involve groups of squeegee men surrounding cars stopped in traffic. Although some merely provided a service, in other cases the windshield-washing would be carried out without asking, often perfunctorily, and with subsequent demands for money, sometimes with added threats of smashing the car's windshield. Upon his election, mayor Rudy Giuliani famously sought to remove squeegee men from the streetsKevin Drum, America's Real Criminal Element: Lead January/February 2013 Issue, \\"\\", visited 8 Jan 2013 as part of his quality-of-life campaign, claiming that their near- ubiquitous presence created an environment of disorder that encouraged more serious crime to flourish. Squeegee men disappeared from city streets during Giuliani's mayoralty and did not reappear in significant numbers. Squeegee men were among the first targeted by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Commissioner William Bratton. In his book Leadership, Giuliani explained that his method of removing the squeegee men from the street involved arresting them. Patrolmen who first made the arrests saw that the squeegee men were released immediately, because according to the New York penal code at the time, cleaning someone's windshield was not illegal. Giuliani told the officers that if they saw any more squeegee men they should simply arrest them for jaywalking.

Captured on 14 October 1747, she was taken into Royal Navy service as the third rate HMS Invincible. She was wrecked in 1758 after hitting a sandbank. The wreck is a Protected Wreck managed by  Ship design  During the early part of the 18th century British ship designers had made few significant advances in design, whereas French shipbuilding benefited from a remarkably creative period. At the time of the capture of Invincible, there was not one 74-gun ship in the Royal Navy. By 1805 at the Battle of Trafalgar, three quarters of British ships of the line were of this singular design and the 74-gun ship had become the backbone of all major navies of the world. Invincible was one of the first trio of a new and longer type of 74-gun ships. Until 1738, French 74s had been little more than 154 (French) feet in gundeck length,note that the French (pre-metric) foot was about 6.5% longer than the British equivalent. carrying just thirteen pairs of 36-pounder guns on the lower deck, fourteen pairs of 18-pounder guns on the upper deck and eight pairs of 8-pounder guns on the quarterdeck and forecastle, with the balance of the 74 guns made up of four small 4-pounder guns on the poop. Invincible after her capture This was changed by Fran√ßois Coulomb's design for , launched in 1739 at Toulon. The gundeck length was stretched to 164 (French) feet, and the four small guns on the poop were eliminated, replaced by new gunports for an additional pair of 36-pounder guns on the lower deck and an extra pair of 18-pounder guns on the upper deck. This new gun establishment became the standard for all subsequent French 74s. The next two ships, Invincible designed by Pierre Morineau and Le Magnanime designed by Blaise Geslain, were begun in early 1741 at Rochefort and were each even longer than Le Terrible.  Active service  At the First Battle of Cape Finisterre (14 May 1747) during the War of the Austrian Succession, Invincible was escorting a convoy of merchant ships when she was sighted by the British channel fleet of 16 ships of the line, which gave chase. Invincible attacked the British ships to give the convoy a chance to escape, and alone engaged six British warships. In the end with most of her crew dead or wounded she struck her colours. Gracious in defeat, the French Commander, Saint-Georges, handed his sword to Admiral George Anson. HMS Invincible sank in February 1758 when she hit a sandbank in the East Solent. The ship remained upright for 3 days after its grounding allowing the crew to safely escape.  Wreck site  The site of the wreck was rediscovered by a fisherman in 1979 and was designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act on 30 September 1980. In 1996 Amer Ved grounded at the wrecksite, although it is not clear whether or not this resulted in damage to the remains. In 2013 the wreck was placed on Historic England's (then called English Heritage) list of ten most at risk heritage sites due to parts of the ship being exposed by changing seabed levels. In July 2016 it was announced that ¬£2 million of the fines imposed for the Libor banking scandal would be used to fund an excavation of the wreck site. In 2015 Historic England undertook conservation of a number of organic objects, gathered by surface recovery and vulnerable to physical and biological decay, publishing the report in 2018. In 2016 Historic England commissioned Pascoe Archaeology Services to conduct a detailed photogrammetry survey of vulnerable and at-risk areas of the Invincible wreck site. In 2017, Historic England adopted a Conservation Management Plan for the wreck site. In December 2019 the BBC was given a preview of some of the 2000 artefacts found at the site, due to go on display to the public in 2020 at Chatham Dockyard as part of a National Museum of the Royal Navy travelling exhibition. These include parts of the ship's hull, tobacco pipes and ceramic hair curlers. A virtual dive trail was developed for the site.

The new lid still features a letter like the old plastic lids, but it is in the form of a \\"what [letter] is a [thing]?\\" question similar to those asked on the TV show Blockbusters (which coincidentally were on hexagonal tiles), the answer for which can be read when the lid is open, next to the hole giving access to the rest of the tube. The hexagonal box is made of one piece of card which is diecut then folded and glued. The hexagon can also be stacked in many layers without the pile collapsing, which is an advantage at the point of sale. The last 100 tubes to leave the factory in York had a certificate inside them. Smarties are no longer manufactured in York; in October 2007, production was moved to Germany, where a third of them were already made. Outside Europe, Nestl√©'s largest production facility for Smarties is in Toronto, Canada, where Nestl√© has been manufacturing products since 1918. The factory located at 72 Sterling Road in the Junction Triangle was originally built for Cowan Cocoa and Chocolate.https://www.thestar.com/life/food_wine/2020/04/29/a-short-history- of-rowntree-maple-buds-and-other-canadian-made-chocolate-treats.html Canadian- made Smarties have a noticeably thicker shell than their European variants. In 1998, Nestle obtained a trademark for a tubular Smarties package. It later sued Master Foods in Denmark, which was marketing M&M; minis in a similar package. The Supreme Court of Denmark ruled that a basic geometrical shape could not be trademarked and ordered the trademark to be removed from the trademark register. Colours UK Nestl√© Smarties, before (above) and immediately after (below) transition to natural colours. Current UK Smarties include a natural blue in place of white. In one of the earlier ranges of colours, there was a light-brown Smartie. This was replaced in 1988 by the blue Smartie. Before 1958, dark-brown Smarties had a plain-chocolate centre, while light-brown ones were coffee-flavoured. The orange Smarties contained orange-flavoured chocolate;Ben Schott, Schott's Food & Drink Miscellany, however, these days the orange flavour is added to the shell only. In 2006 it was announced that Nestl√© was removing all artificial colourings from Smarties in the United Kingdom. Nestl√© decided to replace all synthetic dyes with natural ones, but, unable to source a natural blue dye, removed blue Smarties from circulation (which led to the common misunderstanding that the blue Smartie triggered hyperactivity in some children) and replaced them with white ones. In February 2008, blue smarties were reintroduced using natural blue dye derived from the cyanobacterium spirulina instead of the controversial Brilliant Blue FCF (FD&C; Blue 1, E133). Artificial colouring was removed from Smarties on the Canadian market in March 2009. The new range included all the colours except blue. Blue Smarties were re-added in May 2010. Red Smarties were previously dyed with cochineal, a derivative of the product made by extracting colour from female cochineal beetles. A pigment extracted from red cabbage is now used in the United Kingdom. For the purposes of assessing an \\"active learning approach to epidemiology and critical appraisal\\", a mock randomised controlled trial tested the hypothesis that red Smarties could increase happiness. Based on a trial with 117 participants in four settings in Australia, Canada and Malaysia, red Smarties eaters were no happier than yellow Smarties eaters. Variants UK blue Smarties, old (above) and new (below) Smarties are also sold in the form of chocolate bars and eggs with fragments of Smarties in them, and chocolate-and-vanilla ice cream with Smarties pieces in it known as Smarties Fusion. A variant on Smarties ice cream is the Smarties McFlurry, sold by McDonald's. It was discontinued temporarily in 2012, brought back in early 2014 but withdrawn again in late 2015, being replaced with Oreo. For decades Canadian Dairy Queen restaurants offered a Smarties Blizzard, however, in early 2015 this was dropped and replaced with an M&M;'s Blizzard. The Smarties Blizzard returned to the menu in early 2018. In 1997, larger-sized Giant Smarties were introduced, and, in 2004, Fruity Smarties. Another variation of Smarties, which contained white chocolate rather than milk chocolate, was also introduced. These were trialled as \\"Smarctic Frost Bites\\", however upon their proper release a year or so later, they were simply called White Chocolate Smarties. In 1998, a product known as \\"Smarties Secrets\\" was introduced which contained sweets of varying designs, colours and flavours. The packaging also contained a small comic book. This product is no longer available. In Canada, there was a limited line of red and white Smarties where the white Smarties sport a red maple leaf, reminiscent of the Canadian flag. Holiday packaging for Halloween (sold as Scaries), Christmas and Valentine's Day (containing only pink and red Smarties) is common. Also in Canada, Nestl√© has introduced Peanut and Peanut Butter Smarties. Around Christmas, Nestl√© Australia and Canada often releases Smarties in the Christmas colours of red, green and white. In other countries, like Canada, there is more variety in packaging. Smarties can be purchased in rectangular boxes, a giant tube, or in a stand-up plastic bag, and in 410 g bags in Australia and New Zealand. In the United States a Smarties variant was introduced by Nestl√© for a limited time as part of a product promotion for Disney's animation feature \\"Tarzan\\" in 1999. \\"Tarzan Treats\\" featured red, green, brown, blue, orange and yellow Smarties pieces. Yellow pieces contained an outline graphic of characters featured in the film. This Smarties variant was made in Canada for distribution in the United States. Advertising slogans UK and Ireland The current Smarties slogan is \\"Only Smarties have the answer\\", which has been used since the late 1970s; however, the previous slogan, \\"Do you eat the red ones last?\\", is still occasionally used. In the 1950s and 1960s, the phrase \\"Buy some for Lulu\\" was sung as a tagline in commercials. In the end of the commercial, a boy/girl (usually a teacher or cowboy etc.) says the phrase and walks off, leaving the Rowntree text and the Smartie packaging on the screen for five seconds. This was before the rise of the singer Lulu. Lulu was one of the daughters of a developer of the advert, Richard Oxby. There was also a song called \\"A Handful of Smarties,\\" written by Gerald Masters, which also aired in Europe, The Caribbean and Jamaica. Mid-1980s television commercials were notable for their advanced use of computer-generated imagery, produced by Martin Lambie-Nairn. Canada The words for the Canadian advertising jingle from the 1970s until the mid-1990s were: When you eat your Smarties, do you eat the red ones last? Do you suck them very slowly, or crunch them very fast? Eat those candy-coated chocolates, but tell me when I ask: When you eat your Smarties, do you eat the red ones last? This jingle was set to the tune of Lonnie Donegan's \\"Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavour (On the Bedpost Overnight?)\\". The 2008 advertising campaign showed various people singing \\"Everyday People\\" by Sly and the Family Stone. , the slogan is \\"Show 'your' colours!\\" However, the redesigned 2015 box seems to have reverted to the original \\"Do you eat the red ones last?\\" slogan. Germany The German Smarties slogan is \\"Viele, viele bunte Smarties\\" (which translates as \\"lots and lots of colourful Smarties\\"). South Africa South Africa Nestl√© Smarties, with the \\"wotalotigot\\" slogan on the side In South Africa the slogan is \\"Wot a lot I got\\". This is often printed on one of the sides of the Smarties box in brown lettering simply as a single word, \\"Wotalotigot\\".

The community is one of the designated localidades (localities) in the municipio libre (municipality) of Casas Grandes, one of several such pueblos in a wide, fertile valley long inhabited by indigenous people. Mata Ortiz is located at the base of a mountain known as El Indio and on the west bank of the Rio Palanganas, a tributary of the Rio Casas Grandes. The ancient ruins of Casas Grandes are located nearby. As of 2010, Mata Ortiz had a population of 1,182. History The town was originally established as ‚ÄúPearson‚Äù during the Porfirio D√≠az presidency in the late 19th century with its economy based on agriculture, timber, cattle and the nearby railroad. After the Mexican Revolution the town‚Äôs name was changed, to honor Juan Mata Ortiz, a local hero who fought against the Apaches in the 19th century. After the Revolution was in influx of people and land was redistributed under the ejido system, but many residents still relied on seasonal labor and work with the railroad to get by. Rail work ended in the 1960s when the repair yard was relocated to Nuevo Casas Grandes, leading to the town‚Äôs decline, which continued until the 1980s. Ceramics Mata Ortiz olla The making of pottery in the town began in the 1980s, and now about 300 of the 2,000 inhabitants in the town make a living from making ceramics, with about two-thirds of the population having employment indirectly related to the craft, either providing fuel for kilns or offering guest rooms to traders and tourists. The handicraft has raised living standards considerably in the municipality from the poverty of the early 1980s. Before ceramics, there was only seasonal agricultural jobs for men and for women there was nothing. Pottery has allowed residents to provide things like electricity, plumbing, vehicles and more to families. The movement to create the pottery has included women as well as men since its beginning, and today women of all talent and expertise levels are found in the town. The town is known for its ceramics which are a revival of the Paquim√© tradition, conserving much of its style, decoration and color. The air is often filled with gray tendrils of smoke from the many kilns. The town has hosted a ceramics competition called the Concurso de Cer√°mica since 2008, now supported by FONART, and is a major handcrafts event in Mexico. Other support for artisans comes from other federal and state agency for supplies and training. Mata Ortiz has recently seen a revival of an recontact Oasisamerica pottery tradition. Inspired by pottery from the ancient city of Paquim√©, which traded as far north as New Mexico and Arizona and throughout northern Mexico, contemporary potters are producing work for national and international sale. This new artistic movement is due to the efforts of Juan Quezada Celado, the self-taught originator of modern Mata Ortiz pottery, his extended family and neighbors.

The Republic's founding started with the abdication as King on 10 February 1873 of Amadeo I, following the Hidalgo Affair, when he had been required by the radical government to sign a decree against the artillery officers. The next day, 11 February, the republic was declared by a parliamentary majority made up of radicals, republicans and democrats. Overview The Constituent Cortes was called upon to write a federal constitution. The radicals preferred a unitary republic, with a much lesser role for the provinces, and once the republic had been declared the two parties turned against each other. Initially, the radicals were largely driven from power, joining those who had already been driven out by the revolution of 1868 or by the Carlist War. The first republican attempt in the history of Spain was a short experience, characterized by profound political and social instability and violence. The Republic was governed by four distinct presidents‚ÄîEstanislao Figueras, Francesc Pi i Margall, Nicol√°s Salmer√≥n, Emilio Castelar; then, only eleven months after its proclamation, General Manuel Pav√≠a led a coup d'√©tat and established a unified republic dominated by Francisco Serrano. The period was marked by three simultaneous civil wars: the Third Carlist War, the Cantonal Revolution, the Petroleum Revolution in Alcoy; and by the Ten Years' War in Cuba. The gravest problems for the consolidation of the regime were the lack of true republicans, their division between federalists and unitarians, and the lack of popular support. Subversion in the army, a series of local cantonalist risings, instability in Barcelona, failed anti-federalist coups, calls for revolution by the International Workingmen's Association, the lack of any broad political legitimacy, and personal in-fighting among the republican leadership all further weakened the republic. Seal of the federal canton of Valencia (1873) The Republic effectively ended on 3 January 1874, when the Captain General of Madrid, Manuel Pav√≠a, pronounced against the federalist government and called on all parties except Federalists and Carlists to form a national government. The monarchists and Republicans refused, leaving the unitary Radicals and Constitutionalists as the only group willing to govern; again a narrow political base. General Francisco Serrano formed a new government and was appointed President of the Republic although it was a mere formality since the Cortes had been dissolved. Carlist forces managed to expand the territory under their control to the greatest extent in early 1874, though a series of defeats by the republic's northern army in the second half of the year might have led to the end of the war had it not been for bad weather. However the other monarchists had taken the name of Alfonsists as supporters of Alfonso, the son of the former Queen Isabel, and were organised by C√°novas del Castillo. This period of the Republic lasted until Brigadier Mart√≠nez-Campos pronounced for Alfonso in Sagunto on 29 December 1874 and the rest of the army refused to act against him. The government collapsed, leading to the end of the republic and the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy with the proclamation of Alfonso XII as king.  Proclamation of the Republic  Sheild of the First Spanish Republic King Amadeo I abdicated from the Spanish throne on 11 February 1873. His decision was mainly due to the constant difficulties he had to face during his short tenure, as the Ten Years' War, the outbreak of the Third Carlist War, the opposition from alfonsino monarchists, which hoped for the Bourbon Restoration in the person of Alfonso, son of Isabella II, the many republican insurrections and the division among his own supporters. The Spanish Cortes, which were assembled in a joint and permanent session of both the Congress of Deputies and the Senate, declared themselves the National Assembly while waiting for any final notice from the King. The overwhelming majority was with the monarchists from the two dynastic parties that had exercised the government until then: the Radical Democratic Party of Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla and the Constitutional Party of Pr√°xedes Mateo Sagasta. There also was a small republican minority in the National Assembly, ideologically divided between federalism and centralism. One of them, Federal Democratic Republican Party member Francisco Pi y Margall moved the following proposal: \\"The National Assembly assumes powers and declares the Republic as the form of government, leaving its organization to the Constituent Cortes.\\" In his speech for the proposal (to which he was a signatory, along with Figueras, Salmer√≥n, and other opponents), Pi y Margall‚Äîhimself a federalist‚Äîrenounced for the moment to establish a federal republic, hoping the would-be-assembled Constituent Cortes to decide over the issue, and announced his acceptance of any other democratic decision. Then another republican, Emilio Castelar, took the floor and said: After Castelar's powerful speech, amidst passionate applause, the Republic was declared with a resignation of the monarchists, with 258 votes in favour and only 32 against: \\"The National Assembly assumes all powers and declares the Republic as the form of government of Spain, leaving its organization to the Constituent Cortes. An Executive Power shall be elected directly by the Cortes, and it shall be responsible to the same.\\" In the same session, the first government of the Republic was elected. Federal republican Estanislao Figueras was elected the first \\"President of the Executive Power\\", an office incorporating the heads of State and Government. No \\"President of the Republic\\" was ever elected, as the Constitution creating such office was never enacted. In his speech, Figueras said that the Republic \\"was like a rainbow of peace and harmony of all Spaniards of good will.\\" The passage of these resolutions surprised and stunned most Spaniards, as the recently elected Cortes (now National Assembly) had a wide majority of monarchists. Ruiz Zorrilla spoke in these terms: \\"I protest and will keep doing so, even if I'm left on my own, against those representatives that having come to the Cortes as constitutional monarchists feel themselves authorized to make the decision to turn the nation from monarchist to republican overnight.\\" For most monarchists, though, the impossibility of restoring Isabella II as Queen, and the youth of the future Alfonso XII made the Republic the only, though transitory, viable course of action, particularly given the inevitable failure that awaited it.  Figueras government  The first government of the Republic was formed of federalists and progressives who had been ministers during the monarchy. Four ministers, in particular, had served with King Amadeo: Echegaray (Finance), Becerra (War), Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba (Navy) and Berenguer (Infrastructure). At the beginning, they were plagued by a terrible economic situation, with a 546M peseta budgetary deficit, 153M in debts requiring immediate payment and only 32M available to fulfill them. The Artillery Corps had been dissolved in the most virulent moment of the Carlist and Cuban wars, for which there were not enough soldiers or armament, nor money to feed or purchase them. Besides, Spain was going through a deep economic crisis matching the Panic of 1873 and which was exacerbated by the political instability. In previous years, unemployment had risen steeply amongst field and industrial workers, and proletarian organizations responded with strikes, demonstrations, protest rallies and the occupation of abandoned lands. On 23 February the newly- elected Speaker of the National Assembly, radical Cristino Marcos, plotted a failed coup d'etat in which the Civil Guard occupied the Ministry of Governance and the National Militia surrounded the Congress of Deputies, in order to establish a unitary republic. This prompted the first remodeling of the government in which the progressives were ousted and replaced with federalists. Twelve days after the establishment of the Republic, compulsory military service was removed and voluntary service set up with a daily salary of 1 peseta and one crust (loaf?) of bread. A Republican volunteers corps was also established with an enlistment salary of 50 pesetas and a daily salary of 2 pesetas and 1 crust of bread. The second Figueras government had to face the attempt of proclamation of the Estat Catal√† inside the Spanish Federal Republic on 9 March which was overcome by a series of telegraphic contacts between the government and the Catalan leaders. On 23 April a new coup attempt was set in motion; this time by a collusion of alfonsino monarchists, members of the old Liberal Union and monarchic sectors of the Army; but failed when several units refrained from supporting it at the last hour. Francisco Pi y Margall is usually considered the heart of this government, which had to face several problems already endemic to the Republic, such as the Third Carlist War, separatist insurrections (this time from Catalonia), military indiscipline, monarchic plots, etc. His government dissolved the National Assembly and summoned Constituent Cortes for 1 May. On 23 April Cristino Martos, Speaker of the old National Assembly, attempted a new coup, now supported by the Civil Governor of Madrid: a battalion of militiamen took positions along the Paseo del Prado, and four thousand more perfectly armed volunteers gathered near Independence Square under the pretext of passing review. Having heard from the plot, Pi i Margall mobilized the Civil Guard. For his part, after the Minister of War appointed Baltasar Hidalgo as the new Captain General for Madrid, he ordered Brigadier Carmona and a battalion of infantry and various artillery and cavalry units, to march on the militiamen. The coup d'√©tat failed as soon as it started, and the government dissolved the military units participating and the Permanent Committee of the Assembly. The writs were issued for Constituent Cortes elections on 10 May which resulted 343 seats for federal republicans and 31 for the rest of the political forces. The elections themselves developed in a quite unorthodox environment, and the resulting representation was ridiculous, as most factions in Spain did not participate: the Carlists were still waging war against the Republic, while the alfonsino monarchists of Antonio C√°novas del Castillo, the unitary republicans and even the incipient workers' organization close to the First International all called for abstention. The result was clearly favourable to the federal republicans, which captured 343 of the 371 seats, but turnout was probably the lowest in Spanish history, with about 28% in Catalonia and 25% in Madrid.  The Federal Republic  On 1 June 1873 the first session of the Constituent Cortes was opened and the presentation of resolutions began. The first one was debated on the seventh of June, written by seven representatives: \\"First Article. The form of government of the Spanish Nation is the Democratic Federal Republic\\". The president, having carried out the Cortes' regulations for the definite approval of proposal of law, arranged to hold a nominal vote the next day. The resolution was passed 8 June by a favorable vote of 219 representatives and only 2 against, and the Federal Republic was thus declared. Most of the federalists in parliament supported a Swiss-like confederative model, with regions directly forming independent cantons. Spanish writer Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s, aged 21 at the time, wrote about the parliamentary atmosphere of the First Republic: The situation reached such levels of surrealism that, while presiding over a Cabinet session, Estanislao Figueras yelled: \\"Gentlemen, I can't stand this any more. I am going to be frank with you: I'm fed up with all of us!\\"In Spanish: ¬´Se√±ores, ya no aguanto m√°s. Voy a serles franco: ¬°estoy hasta los cojones de todos nosotros!¬ª In the allegedly original Catalan: ¬´Senyors, ja no aguanto m√©s. Vaig a ser-los franc: estic fins als collons de tots nosaltres!¬ª So fed up that on 10 June he left his resignation letter in his office, went for a walk through the Parque del Buen Retiro and, without telling anyone, boarded the first train departing from the Atocha Station. He would only step down upon arriving in Paris.  The government of Pi i Margall  After Figueras' flight to France, the power vacuum created was tempting general Manuel Sodas into starting a pronunciamiento when a Civil Guard colonel, Jos√© de la Iglesia, showed up at Congress and declared that nobody would leave until a new President was elected. Figueras' fellow federalist and government minister Francisco Pi y Margall was elected on 11 June, but on his speech to the Assembly he declared he was at a complete loss and without a program. The main efforts of the new government focused on the drafting of the new Constitution and some social character-related bills: * Apportionment of disamortized lands among lessees, settlers and aparceros.People who obtained free use of a land for a percentage of the profits. It was used by many landowners as an alternative to direct exploitation or rental. * Reestablishment of the regular Army, with mandatory conscription. * Separation of Church and State, which had been deeply intertwined under Ferdinand VII and only slightly separated by Isabella II. * Abolition of slavery throughout the nation. Though the 1812 C√°diz Constitution had already taken some steps on the issue, the colonies remained opposed to the move from mainland Spain. Also, plans were made to limit child labor. * Establishment of a system ensuring free and compulsory education. * Legalization of the right of syndication, creation of mixed workers-managers juries and establishment of the 8 hours work day. On 16 June a 25-member Committee was set up by the Cortes to study the draft Constitution of the Federal Republic of Spain, the redaction of which is mainly attributed to Emilio Castelar, with debate starting the following day. On 28 June Pi i Margall renewed the composition of his government, but due to the slow pace of the constitutional debates in the Cortes, events came crashing down on the government at a stunning pace. On 30 June the City Council of Seville passed a motion declaring the town a Social Republic, and the next day many federalist deputies left the Cortes in protest. About a week later, on 9 July Alcoy followed suit, in the midst of a wave of murders sparked by a revolutionary strike directed by local leaders of the First International. It was just the beginning: shortly after, the cantonal revolution swept across Spain with strikes, murders of officers by soldiers, lynching of city mayors and over a hundred casualties. The Cantonal Revolution spread through southern and central Spain, but the traditionalist pro-Carlist northern regions of Catalonia, Aragon and the Basque Country were involved in the Third Carlist War. The federalist sentiment did not give rise to autonomous states as intended but into a constellation of independent cantons instead. Uprisings were daily news in the south-eastern area of Levante and Andalusia. Some cantons were provincial in nature, like Valencia or M√°laga, but most comprised just a city and its surroundings, like the more localised cantons of Alcoy, Cartagena, Seville, C√°diz, Almansa, Torrevieja, Castell√≥n, Granada, Salamanca, Bail√©n, And√∫jar, Tarifa and Algeciras. Even smaller were the village-based cantons of Camu√±as (in Albacete) and Jumilla (in Murcia). The latter is said to have issued a manifesto stating: There is, however, no record of such a manifesto, nor of any similar declaration, in the municipal archives; and the proceedings of the time seemed to be within normality. This has motivated several historians to deny the authenticity of the manifesto and even the very existence of the Jumilla canton, stating that its invention was merely a form of anti-republican propaganda. The most active - and known - of the cantons was that of Cartagena, born on 12 July at the city naval base under the inspiration of the federalist congressman Antonio G√°lvez Arce, known as Antonete. The Cartagena would live six months of constant wars, and even minted its own currency, the duro cantonal. The first deed of the Cartagenan cantonalists was the capture of the Saint Julian castle, which motivated a strange telegram sent by the city's captain-general to the Minister of the Navy: \\"Saint Julian castle shows Turkish flag\\". Such \\"Turkish flag\\" was in fact the cantonal flag, the first red flag in Spanish history (the Ottoman Civil Ensign was a plain red flag, hence the captain-general's terminology). G√°lvez's passionate speeches allowed him to gain control of the Navy ships docked in the city, which at that time were among the best in the Spanish Navy. Under his command, the fleet wreaked havoc on the nearby Mediterranean shore, causing the Madrid government to declare him a pirate and set a bounty on his head. Back on land, he led an expedition towards Madrid that was defeated at Chinchilla. Two cantonal frigates, the Almansa and the Vitoria, set sail towards a \\"foreign power\\" (the Spanish city of Almer√≠a) for fund- raising. As the city would not pay, it was bombarded and taken by the cantonalists. General Contreras, commanding officer of the cantonal fleet, ordered the Marcha Real to be played as he unboarded. Afterwards, the deed would be repeated in Alicante, but on the trip back to Cartagena they were captured as pirates by the armoured frigates HMS Swiftsure and SMS Friedrich Karl, under the UK and German flags respectively. An even worse problem was the Third Carlist War, in which the rebels controlled most of the Basque Country, Navarre and Catalonia without opposition, and sent raid parties throughout the Peninsula. The Carlist pretender, Charles VII, had formed a rival government in Estella with his own ministers and was already minting currency, while the French connivance allowed him to receive external aid and fortify his defences. Between the Carlists and the cantonal revolution, the actual territory in which the short-lived Republic exerted undisputed authority did not extend much further than the province of Madrid itself and North-Western Spain, as cantonal uprisings took place as far north as √Åvila. Due to the rapid pace of the events, and without time for the new Constitution to be passed by the Cortes, Pi i Margall found himself between a rock and the proverbial hard place of the cantonal revolution. However, the effective Commander in Chief of the Republic rejected all calls, from both military and political instances, to exert repression on the cantonal uprisings, as he argued they were just following his very own doctrine. Thus, he was forced to resign on 18 July after just 37 days in office. He would later sorely describe his experience as premier: Drafting the Federal Constitution The draft of the Federal Constitution of the First Republic of Spain developed at length into 117 articles organized under 17 titles. In the first article, the following is found: > Composing the Spanish Nation the states of Andaluc√≠a Alta, Andaluc√≠a Baja, > Arag√≥n, Asturias, Baleares, Canarias, Castilla la Nueva, Castilla la Vieja, > Catalu√±a, Cuba, Extremadura, Galicia, Murcia, Navarra, Puerto Rico, > Valencia, Regiones Vascongadas. The states will be able to conserve the > actual provinces and modify them, according to their territorial > necessities. These states would have \\"complete economic-administrative autonomy and political autonomy compatible with the existence of the nation\\" such as \\"the ability to give it a political constitution\\" (articles 92 and 93). The constitutional draft anticipated in Title IV‚Äîin addition to the classic Legislative Power, Executive Power and Judicial Power‚Äîa fourth Relational Power that would be exercised by the president of the Republic. Legislative Power would be in the hands of the Federal Cortes, which would be composed of the Congress and the Senate. Congress was to be a house of proportional representation with one representative \\"for every 50,000 souls\\", renewing every two years. The Senate was to be a house of territorial representation, four senators being elected by the Cortes of each one of the states. Executive Power would be exercised by the Ministry of Advisors, whose president would be elected by the president of the republic. Article 40 of the draft stated: \\"In the political organization of the Spanish nation, all things individual are the pure domain of the individual; all things municipal are that of the municipality; all things regional are that of the state; and all things national, of the Federation.\\" The following article declared that \\"All powers are elective, revocable, and accountable\\", and Article 42 that \\"Sovereignty resides in all citizens, which they exercise by their own representation by the political organizations of the Republic, constituted through universal suffrage.\\" Judicial Power would reside in the Federal Supreme Court, which would be composed \\"of three magistrates for each state of the federation\\" (Article 73) that would never be elected by the Executive Power or the Legislative Power. It also would establish that all courts would be profession and the judicial institution for all classes of representatives. Relational Power would be exercised by the president of the Federal Republic whose mandate would last \\"four years, not being immediately reeligible\\", as says Article 81 of the draft.  The government of Nicol√°s Salmer√≥n  After accepting the resignation of Pi i Margall, Nicol√°s Salmer√≥n was elected president of the Executive Power, with 119 votes in favor and 93 votes against. The new president, who was a moderate federalist republican, defended the necessity of arriving at an understanding with the more moderate or conservative groups and a slow transition toward a federal republic. His oratory was crushing: Francisco Silvela said that in his speeches, Salmer√≥n only used one weapon‚Äîartillery. Antonio Maura characterized the professorial tone of Don Nicol√°s, saying that \\"it always seemed that he was addressing the metaphysicists of Albacete.\\" Already during his stints as Minister of Mercy and Justice in the government of Estanislao Figueras, he brought about the abolition of the death penalty, even the independence of judicial power in the face of the political. His nomination produced an intensification of the cantonal movement, which to control he had to resort to generals openly against the Federal Republic, sending military expeditions to Andaluc√≠a and Valencia under the respective command of generals Pav√≠a and Mart√≠nez Campos. One after another the separate cantons were subdued, except that of Cartagena, which resisted until 12 January 1874. His generals asked the \\"awareness\\" of the government and his signature to execute various death sentences on various deserting soldiers on the Carlist front; according to them, this was essential to reestablishing discipline on the army. Salmer√≥n, man of very advanced liberal principles, declined to concede the \\"awareness\\" and, as is written on the wall of his mausoleum, \\"abandoned power to not sign a death sentence.\\" In this way, he resigned on 6 September.  The government of Emilio Castelar  The next day, 7 September, the man elected to occupy the presidency of the Executive Power was unitarian Emilio Castelar, professor of History and distinguished orator, by 133 votes in favor against the 67 obtained by Pi i Margall. During his previous time as Minister of State in the government of Estanislao Figueras, Castelar promoted and achieved the approval of the abolition of slavery in the overseas territory of Puerto Rico, although not in Cuba because of the continuing war situation. This act by the First Spanish Republic is commemorated in Puerto Rico up to the present day. Motivated by the difficult situation through which the Republic was passing, with the aggravation of the Carlist War, Emilio Castelar commenced the reorganization of the army, announcing before the Cortes \\"to sustain this form of government, I need much infantry, much cavalry, much artillery, much Civil Guard, and many riflemen.\\" In spite of the federalist opposition, the Cortes conceded to him extraordinary powers to govern, after which they closed the Cortes on 20 September. He confirmed the death sentences that provoked the resignation of his predecessor, reestablished order, and was at the point of surrendering to the cantonalists of Cartagena. Without doubt, the chaos incited by the cantonal revolt and the worsening of the Carlist War led them to reopen the Cortes on 2 January 1874, in order to bring to a vote the management and ask for unlimited powers with which to save the Republic from complete discredit. In effect, the Cortes session opened on 2 January 1874, but the federalists rose up against Don Emilio Castelar, who was supported by the captain general of Madrid, Don Manuel Pav√≠a, former supporter of Prim, with whom he had rebelled in Villarejo de Salvan√©s. Two very different forces threatened to interrupt the deliberations of the Cortes: the federalists, eager to finish Castelar with mighty wrath, and the troops of General Pav√≠a, supporter of Castelar, who had decided to show up in his support to avoid his defeat before the federalists. The committed regiments had already left at the captain general's orders when the Cortes recognized Castelar's defeat by 119 votes against 101. The former president of the Republic, and the president of the Cortes, Nicol√°s Salmer√≥n, called for a new vote to elect a new chief of the Executive Power. Pav√≠a situated himself in front of the building with his staff and ordered two adjutants to impose upon Salmer√≥n the dissolution of the Cortes session and the evacuation of the building in five minutes. The Civil Guard, which guarded the Congress, put into action the general's orders and occupied the halls of Congress (without entering the floor). It was 6:55 in the morning, when the vote to elect the federalist candidate Eduardo Palance was proceeding, and Salmer√≥n, upon receiving the captain general's order, suspended the vote and communicated the grave situation to the representatives. The representatives abandoned the building with all speed, amidst scenes of exaggerated hysterics; some even threw themselves out the windows. Pav√≠a, surprised, asked: \\"But gentlemen, Why jump out the windows when you can leave through the door?\\" Pav√≠a, who was a unitarian republican, offered to allow Emilio Castelar to continue in the presidency, but he refused, not wanting to maintain power through undemocratic means. These acts signified the unofficial end of the First Republic, although it officially continued for almost a year.  The unitary republic  At the same time as the political convulsions were taking place, General L√≥pez Dom√≠nguez entered into Cartagena on 12 January, replacing Mart√≠nez Campos, while Antonete G√°lvez, with more than a thousand men, struggled to elude him near the border of Numancia (Numantia) and set course for Oran, (Algeria). The end of the cantonal experience was marked by G√°lvez with his exile, but the Bourbon Restoration permitted him through amnesty to return to his native Torreag√ºera. In this period he would strike up a strange and warm friendship with Don Antonio C√°novas del Castillo, most responsible for the Restoration, who considered G√°lvez a sincere, honorable, and valiant man, although one of exaggerated political ideas. Meanwhile, after Emilio Castelar's refusal to continue as president, he put General Serrano, recently returned from his exile in Biarritz for his implication in the attempted coup of 23 April, in charge of the formation of a coalition government that grouped together monarchists, conservatives, and unitarian republicans, but excluded federalist republicans. Francisco Serrano, Duke of Torre, 63 years old, former collaborator of Isabel II, had already twice freed the leadership of the state. He proclaimed the Unitary Republic, taking control of the presidency of the Executive Power, and dispensing with the Cortes in a conservative republican dictatorship. During his mandate he once and for all subdued the cantonal insurrections, and that of Cartagena, and concentrated his forces on the Carlist War in the north of Spain. The general attempted without success to consolidate power to himself in dictatorship form, following the example of the regime of dukes and generals that prevailed in France upon the fall of Napoleon III and after the defeat of the Paris Commune. In just a few months, on 13 May, Serrano ceded the presidency of the government to Juan de Zavala y de la Puente to personally take control of the operations against the Carlists in the north. Pr√°xedes Mateo Sagasta took charge of the government on 3 September. On 10 December the siege of Pamplona began, but it was interrupted by the Proclamation of Sagunto.  The end of the Republic  On 29 December 1874 in Sagunto, General Arsenio Mart√≠nez Campos came out in favor of the restoration to the throne of the Bourbon monarchy in the personage of Don Alfonso de Borb√≥n, son of Isabel II. The government of Sagasta did not oppose this announcement, permitting the restoration of the monarchy. The triumph of the Bourbon Restoration succeeded thanks to the previous work of Antonio C√°novas del Castillo, which without a doubt was contrary to military rule. Until 1931, the Spanish republicans celebrated the 11 February anniversary of the First Republic. Thereafter, the commemoration was moved to 14 April, the anniversary of the proclamation of the Second Republic in 1931.

April 26, 1932. A bank run (also known as a run on the bank) occurs when many clients withdraw their money from a bank, because they believe the bank may cease to function in the near future. In other words, it is when, in a fractional-reserve banking system (where banks normally only keep a small proportion of their assets as cash), numerous customers withdraw cash from deposit accounts with a financial institution at the same time because they believe that the financial institution is, or might become, insolvent; they keep the cash or transfer it into other assets, such as government bonds, precious metals or gemstones. When they transfer funds to another institution, it may be characterized as a capital flight. As a bank run progresses, it generates its own momentum: as more people withdraw cash, the likelihood of default increases, triggering further withdrawals. This can destabilize the bank to the point where it runs out of cash and thus faces sudden bankruptcy. To combat a bank run, a bank may limit how much cash each customer may withdraw, suspend withdrawals altogether, or promptly acquire more cash from other banks or from the central bank, besides other measures. A banking panic or bank panic is a financial crisis that occurs when many banks suffer runs at the same time, as people suddenly try to convert their threatened deposits into cash or try to get out of their domestic banking system altogether. A systemic banking crisis is one where all or almost all of the banking capital in a country is wiped out. The resulting chain of bankruptcies can cause a long economic recession as domestic businesses and consumers are starved of capital as the domestic banking system shuts down. According to former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, the Great Depression was caused by the Federal Reserve System, and much of the economic damage was caused directly by bank runs. The cost of cleaning up a systemic banking crisis can be huge, with fiscal costs averaging 13% of GDP and economic output losses averaging 20% of GDP for important crises from 1970 to 2007. Several techniques have been used to try to prevent bank runs or mitigate their effects. They have included a higher reserve requirement (requiring banks to keep more of their reserves as cash), government bailouts of banks, supervision and regulation of commercial banks, the organization of central banks that act as a lender of last resort, the protection of deposit insurance systems such as the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and after a run has started, a temporary suspension of withdrawals. These techniques do not always work: for example, even with deposit insurance, depositors may still be motivated by beliefs they may lack immediate access to deposits during a bank reorganization. History The run on the Montreal City and District Savings Bank, with the mayor addressing the crowd. Printed in 1872 in the Canadian Illustrated News. Bank runs first appeared as part of cycles of credit expansion and its subsequent contraction. In the 16th century onwards, English goldsmiths issuing promissory notes suffered severe failures due to bad harvests, plummeting parts of the country into famine and unrest. Other examples are the Dutch Tulip manias (1634‚Äì1637), the British South Sea Bubble (1717‚Äì1719), the French Mississippi Company (1717‚Äì1720), the post- Napoleonic depression (1815‚Äì1830) and the Great Depression (1929‚Äì1939). Bank runs have also been used to blackmail individuals or governments. In 1832, for example, the British government under the Duke of Wellington overturned a majority government on the orders of the king, William IV, to prevent reform (the later 1832 Reform Act). Wellington's actions angered reformers, and they threatened a run on the banks under the rallying cry \\"Stop the Duke, go for gold!\\". Many of the recessions in the United States were caused by banking panics. The Great Depression contained several banking crises consisting of runs on multiple banks from 1929 to 1933; some of these were specific to regions of the U.S. Bank runs were most common in states whose laws allowed banks to operate only a single branch, dramatically increasing risk compared to banks with multiple branches particularly when single-branch banks were located in areas economically dependent on a single industry. Banking panics began in the Upper-South in November 1930, one year after the stock market crash, triggered by the collapse of a string of banks in Tennessee and Kentucky, which brought down their correspondent networks. In December, New York City experienced massive bank runs that were contained to the many branches of a single bank. Philadelphia was hit a week later by bank runs that affected several banks, but were successfully contained by quick action by the leading city banks and the Federal Reserve Bank. Withdrawals became worse after financial conglomerates in New York and Los Angeles failed in prominently-covered scandals. Much of the US Depression's economic damage was caused directly by bank runs, though Canada had no bank runs during this same era due to different banking regulations. Money supply decreased substantially between Black Tuesday and the Bank Holiday in March 1933 when there were massive bank runs across the United States. Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argued that steady withdrawals from banks by nervous depositors (\\"hoarding\\") were inspired by news of the fall 1930 bank runs and forced banks to liquidate loans, which directly caused a decrease in the money supply, shrinking the economy. Bank runs continued to plague the United States for the next several years. Citywide runs hit Boston (Dec. 1931), Chicago (June 1931 and June 1932), Toledo (June 1931), and St. Louis (Jan. 1933), among others. Institutions put into place during the Depression have prevented runs on U.S. commercial banks since the 1930s, even under conditions such as the U.S. savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s. The global financial crisis that began in 2007 was centered around market-liquidity failures that were comparable to a bank run. The crisis contained a wave of bank nationalizations, including those associated with Northern Rock of the UK and IndyMac of the U.S. This crisis was caused by low real interest rates stimulating an asset price bubble fuelled by new financial products that were not stress tested and that failed in the downturn. Theory A poster for the 1896 Broadway melodrama The War of Wealth depicts a 19th-century bank run in the U.S. Under fractional-reserve banking, the type of banking currently used in most developed countries, banks retain only a fraction of their demand deposits as cash. The remainder is invested in securities and loans, whose terms are typically longer than the demand deposits, resulting in an asset‚Äìliability mismatch. No bank has enough reserves on hand to cope with all deposits being taken out at once. Diamond and Dybvig developed an influential model to explain why bank runs occur and why banks issue deposits that are more liquid than their assets. According to the model, the bank acts as an intermediary between borrowers who prefer long-maturity loans and depositors who prefer liquid accounts. Reprinted (2000) Fed Res Bank Mn Q Rev 24 (1), 14‚Äì23. The Diamond-Dybvig model provides an example of an economic game with more than one Nash equilibrium, where it is logical for individual depositors to engage in a bank run once they suspect one might start, even though that run will cause the bank to collapse. In the model, business investment requires expenditures in the present to obtain returns that take time in coming, for example, spending on machines and buildings now for production in future years. A business or entrepreneur that needs to borrow to finance investment will want to give their investments a long time to generate returns before full repayment, and will prefer long maturity loans, which offer little liquidity to the lender. The same principle applies to individuals and households seeking financing to purchase large-ticket items such as housing or automobiles. The households and firms who have the money to lend to these businesses may have sudden, unpredictable needs for cash, so they are often willing to lend only on the condition of being guaranteed immediate access to their money in the form of liquid demand deposit accounts, that is, accounts with shortest possible maturity. Since borrowers need money and depositors fear to make these loans individually, banks provide a valuable service by aggregating funds from many individual deposits, portioning them into loans for borrowers, and spreading the risks both of default and sudden demands for cash. Banks can charge much higher interest on their long-term loans than they pay out on demand deposits, allowing them to earn a profit. Depositors clamor to withdraw their savings from a bank in Berlin, 13 July 1931 If only a few depositors withdraw at any given time, this arrangement works well. Barring some major emergency on a scale matching or exceeding the bank's geographical area of operation, depositors' unpredictable needs for cash are unlikely to occur at the same time; that is, by the law of large numbers, banks can expect only a small percentage of accounts withdrawn on any one day because individual expenditure needs are largely uncorrelated. A bank can make loans over a long horizon, while keeping only relatively small amounts of cash on hand to pay any depositors who may demand withdrawals. However, if many depositors withdraw all at once, the bank itself (as opposed to individual investors) may run short of liquidity, and depositors will rush to withdraw their money, forcing the bank to liquidate many of its assets at a loss, and eventually to fail. If such a bank were to attempt to call in its loans early, businesses might be forced to disrupt their production while individuals might need to sell their homes and/or vehicles, causing further losses to the larger economy. Even so, many if not most debtors would be unable to pay the bank in full on demand and would be forced to declare bankruptcy, possibly affecting other creditors in the process. A bank run can occur even when started by a false story. Even depositors who know the story is false will have an incentive to withdraw, if they suspect other depositors will believe the story. The story becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Indeed, Robert K. Merton, who coined the term self-fulfilling prophecy, mentioned bank runs as a prime example of the concept in his book Social Theory and Social Structure. Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, once noted that it may not be rational to start a bank run, but it is rational to participate in one once it had started. Systemic banking crisis Bank run during the Great Depression in the United States, February 1933. A bank run is the sudden withdrawal of deposits of just one bank. A banking panic or bank panic is a financial crisis that occurs when many banks suffer runs at the same time, as a cascading failure. In a systemic banking crisis, all or almost all of the banking capital in a country is wiped out; this can result when regulators ignore systemic risks and spillover effects. Systemic banking crises are associated with substantial fiscal costs and large output losses. Frequently, emergency liquidity support and blanket guarantees have been used to contain these crises, not always successfully. Although fiscal tightening may help contain market pressures if a crisis is triggered by unsustainable fiscal policies, expansionary fiscal policies are typically used. In crises of liquidity and solvency, central banks can provide liquidity to support illiquid banks. Depositor protection can help restore confidence, although it tends to be costly and does not necessarily speed up economic recovery. Intervention is often delayed in the hope that recovery will occur, and this delay increases the stress on the economy. Some measures are more effective than others in containing economic fallout and restoring the banking system after a systemic crisis. These include establishing the scale of the problem, targeted debt relief programs to distressed borrowers, corporate restructuring programs, recognizing bank losses, and adequately capitalizing banks. Speed of intervention appears to be crucial; intervention is often delayed in the hope that insolvent banks will recover if given liquidity support and relaxation of regulations, and in the end this delay increases stress on the economy. Programs that are targeted, that specify clear quantifiable rules that limit access to preferred assistance, and that contain meaningful standards for capital regulation, appear to be more successful. According to IMF, government-owned asset management companies (bad banks) are largely ineffective due to political constraints. A silent run occurs when the implicit fiscal deficit from a government's unbooked loss exposure to zombie banks is large enough to deter depositors of those banks. As more depositors and investors begin to doubt whether a government can support a country's banking system, the silent run on the system can gather steam, causing the zombie banks' funding costs to increase. If a zombie bank sells some assets at market value, its remaining assets contain a larger fraction of unbooked losses; if it rolls over its liabilities at increased interest rates, it squeezes its profits along with the profits of healthier competitors. The longer the silent run goes on, the more benefits are transferred from healthy banks and taxpayers to the zombie banks. The term is also used when many depositors in countries with deposit insurance draw down their balances below the limit for deposit insurance. The cost of cleaning up after a crisis can be huge. In systemically important banking crises in the world from 1970 to 2007, the average net recapitalization cost to the government was 6% of GDP, fiscal costs associated with crisis management averaged 13% of GDP (16% of GDP if expense recoveries are ignored), and economic output losses averaged about 20% of GDP during the first four years of the crisis. Prevention and mitigation 2007 run on Northern Rock, a UK bank, during the late-2000s financial crisis. A run on a Bank of East Asia branch in Hong Kong, caused by \\"malicious rumours\\" in 2008. Several techniques have been used to help prevent or mitigate bank runs.  Individual banks  Some prevention techniques apply to individual banks, independently of the rest of the economy. * Banks often project an appearance of stability, with solid architecture and conservative dress. * A bank may try to hide information that might spark a run. For example, in the days before deposit insurance, it made sense for a bank to have a large lobby and fast service, to prevent the formation of a line of depositors extending out into the street which might cause passers-by to infer a bank run. * A bank may try to slow down the bank run by artificially slowing the process. One technique is to get a large number of friends and relatives of bank employees to stand in line and make many small, slow transactions. * Scheduling prominent deliveries of cash can convince participants in a bank run that there is no need to withdraw deposits hastily. * Banks can encourage customers to make term deposits that cannot be withdrawn on demand. If term deposits form a high enough percentage of a bank's liabilities its vulnerability to bank runs will be reduced considerably. The drawback is that banks have to pay a higher interest rate on term deposits. * A bank can temporarily suspend withdrawals to stop a run; this is called suspension of convertibility. In many cases the threat of suspension prevents the run, which means the threat need not be carried out. * Emergency acquisition of a vulnerable bank by another institution with stronger capital reserves. This technique is commonly used by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to dispose of insolvent banks, rather than paying depositors directly from its own funds. * If there is no immediate prospective buyer for a failing institution, a regulator or deposit insurer may set up a bridge bank which operates temporarily until the business can be liquidated or sold. * To clean up after a bank failure, the government may set up a \\"bad bank\\", which is a new government-run asset management corporation that buys individual nonperforming assets from one or more private banks, reducing the proportion of junk bonds in their asset pools, and then acts as the creditor in the insolvency cases that follow. This, however, creates a moral hazard problem, essentially subsidizing bankruptcy: temporarily underperforming debtors can be forced to file for bankruptcy in order to make them eligible to be sold to the bad bank.  Systemic techniques  Some prevention techniques apply across the whole economy, though they may still allow individual institutions to fail. * Deposit insurance systems insure each depositor up to a certain amount, so that depositors' savings are protected even if the bank fails. This removes the incentive to withdraw one's deposits simply because others are withdrawing theirs. However, depositors may still be motivated by fears they may lack immediate access to deposits during a bank reorganization. To avoid such fears triggering a run, the U.S. FDIC keeps its takeover operations secret, and re-opens branches under new ownership on the next business day. Government deposit insurance programs can be ineffective if the government itself is perceived to be running short of cash. * Bank capital requirements reduces the possibility that a bank becomes insolvent. The Basel III agreement strengthens bank capital requirements and introduces new regulatory requirements on bank liquidity and bank leverage. ** Full-reserve banking is the hypothetical case where the reserve ratio is set to 100%, and funds deposited are not lent out by the bank as long as the depositor retains the legal right to withdraw the funds on demand. Under this approach, banks would be forced to match maturities of loans and deposits, thus greatly reducing the risk of bank runs. ** A less severe alternative to full-reserve banking is a reserve ratio requirement, which limits the proportion of deposits which a bank can lend out, making it less likely for a bank run to start, as more reserves will be available to satisfy the demands of depositors. This practice sets a limit on the fraction in fractional-reserve banking. * Transparency may help prevent crises spreading through the banking system. In the context of the recent crisis, the extreme complexity of certain types of assets made it difficult for market participants to assess which financial institutions would survive, which amplified the crisis by making most institutions very reluctant to lend to one another. * Central banks act as a lender of last resort. To prevent a bank run, the central bank guarantees that it will make short-term loans to banks, to ensure that, if they remain economically viable, they will always have enough liquidity to honor their deposits. Walter Bagehot's book Lombard Street provides influential early analysis of the role of the lender of last resort. The role of the lender of last resort, and the existence of deposit insurance, both create moral hazard, since they reduce banks' incentive to avoid making risky loans. They are nonetheless standard practice, as the benefits of collective prevention are commonly believed to outweigh the costs of excessive risk-taking. Techniques to deal with a banking panic when prevention have failed: * Declaring an emergency bank holiday * Government or central bank announcements of increased lines of credit, loans, or bailouts for vulnerable banks Depictions in fiction The bank panic of 1933 is the setting of Archibald MacLeish's 1935 play, Panic. Other fictional depictions of bank runs include those in American Madness (1932), It's a Wonderful Life (1946, set in 1932 U.S.), Silver River (1948), Mary Poppins (1964, set in 1910 London), Noble House (1988) and The Pope Must Die (1991). Arthur Hailey's novel The Moneychangers includes a potentially fatal run on a fictitious US bank. A run on a bank is one of the many causes of the characters' suffering in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle.

It is used for cleaning and in printing. The earliest written references to squeegees date from the mid-19th century and concern deck- cleaning tools, some with leather rather than rubber blades. The name \\"squeegee\\" may come from the word \\"squeege\\", meaning press or squeeze, which was first recorded in 1783. The closely related \\"squeedging\\" was reportedly first used in 1782, in the Covent Garden Theatre, during the performing of the comedy Which is the Man? by Hannah Cowley. Window cleaning A window squeegee The best-known of these tools is probably the hand-held window squeegee, used to remove the cleaning fluid or water from a glass surface. A soapy solution acts as a lubricant and breaks up the dirt, then the squeegee is used to draw the now water-borne dirt off the glass leaving a clean surface. Some squeegees are backed with a sponge which can soak up soapy water from a bucket for application to a dirty window. Squeegees were in use for cleaning windows by 1918 when an American book on navy jargon explained that a deck-cleaning tool called a squeegee was \\"used in civil life to clean windows\\".Logan Elsworth Ruggles, The navy explained, Appleton NY c1918 This is the earliest written reference to a window cleaning squeegee given by the Oxford English Dictionary. (For earlier uses see \\"floor cleaning\\" section below.) With the development of the skyscraper in the 20th century, a more efficient tool for the cleaning of window exteriors was needed. Professional window washers began using the Chicago squeegee, a bulky tool with two heavy pink rubber blades. Changing the blades required the loosening of twelve separate screws. The modern single-blade window cleaning squeegee was patented by Ettore Steccone in 1936; who dubbed it the \\"New Deal\\". It was made of lightweight brass with a very flexible and sharp rubber blade. Steccone began a manufacturing process and sold the product in his garage. The Ettore Products Co. is still the leader in the squeegee market today. Squeegee kits can include a telescoping pole to extend the washer's reach. Simple squeegees are made in various shapes for household use, including the cleaning of shower doors, bathroom tile, and garage floors. Techniques The \\"swivel method\\", or \\"fan method\\" as it is referred to by professionals, uses a series of strokes combined with turns that hold the water away from the leading edge of the squeegee; when the turn is completed in the opposing direction, there is no water and no dirt left isolated. However straight strokes, either horizontally or vertically are normally much more efficient than ‚Äúfanning‚Äù. If a few spots are missed, a chamois leather cloth works better for touch up than a towel of cloth or paper. Using a squeegee for window cleaning may sometimes produce run lines. These are caused by cleaning fluid being pushed up into the top edge of the window, or by fluid flowing from under the rubber blade into the dry area of the glass. The latter of these cases may be prevented by holding the squeegee at a slight angle relative to the direction in which it is being moved, directing fluid flow towards the wet area of the glass. Another method used by window cleaners is to tap the blade on an already wet area of the glass to remove any excess water on the rubber blade. Alternatively the rubber blade can be dried with a towel, although this method is slower and not practical when using extension poles. According to Guinness World Records, the world's fastest window cleaner is Terry Burrows of South Ockendon, Essex, England, who cleaned three standard office windows set in a frame in 9.24 seconds at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham in March 2005. He used a squeegee and of water. Floor cleaning The floor squeegee is similar to the window squeegee but has a long handle like a push broom, used to clean floors after they have been sprayed with water or soap, to push the water into drains. This is often used in places that need the floors cleaned regularly, such as army barracks or the meat departments in supermarkets. Hospitals sometimes use the floor squeegee to clean up any spills that occur in operating rooms or regular patient rooms as the design of the squeegee lends itself towards a more sanitary clean up. Decks of ships The earliest quotations mentioning squeegees in the Oxford English Dictionary refer to their use in cleaning decks on board ship: in 1844 a \\"squee gee\\" in an American book,Matilda Charlotte Fraser Houstoun, Texas and the Gulf of Mexico: or yachting in the New World, J. Murray 1844 in 1851 a \\"leathern squilgee\\" in Moby-Dick, and in 1867 in a British book by Admiral William Henry Smyth.William Henry Smyth, The sailor‚Äôs word-book: an alphabetical digest of nautical terms, London 1st edition, 1867 Additionally, Richard Henry Dana‚Äôs 1840 memoir Two Years Before the Mast mentions ‚Äúsquilgeeing‚Äù in Chapter XIV. The following are considered correct English terminologies, according to the [Canadian] Naval Terminology Standardization Committee: * squeegee; * deck squeegee; * squilgee; and * squillagee.  Street cleaning  Kindling Street Washing Machine, also known as the Kindling Squeegee, c. 1911 Squeegees on broom handles were used for street cleaning in the later nineteenth century. This was the case in London by 1873.Once a Week magazine, London, 11 Oct 1873 pp323-326 In the early twentieth century some cities in Europe and North America used horse-drawn machinery with rotating rubber squeegee blades on rollers behind a water tank connected to sprinklers. In 1911 this was described as \\"a German invention which has been for some years in successful operation in leading German cities\\".Marion William Grigsby, Modern Methods of Street Cleaning, Civil Engineering thesis, University of Illinois, 1911, pp29-31 A US version of the rotating squeegee machine, known as the Kindling Squeegee or Kindling Street Washing Machine, was in use by the time of that description. It was manufactured in Milwaukee by Louis Kindling who had migrated from Germany to Wisconsin in 1873.Wisconsin Historical Society By 1915 some streets in Paris, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia were being cleaned by this kind of machine, while London still depended on men with hand brooms and squeegees.Arthur H. Blanchard, Elements of Highway Engineering, Wiley NY 1915, pp379-384 In 1919 Kindling got a US patent for a design with \\"new and useful Improvements in Squeegee-Rollers\\",US patent 1297694 following another \\"improvements\\" patent for squeegee street cleaning machines filed in 1915 by the inventor and civil engineer Samuel Whinery (1845-1925) (resident of East Orange, New Jersey) and published in 1916. In 1914, William H. Connell (Chief, Bureau of Highways and Street Cleaning in Philadelphia) explained that the street cleaning was done in batteries of \\"two and three squeegee machines preceded by sprinklers\\" reportedly about ahead. The American Highway Engineers' Handbook of 1919 reveals that this method was used in order for the water: The need for supporting labour and foot was seen as a disadvantage. Further more, the squeegee machines were pulled by horses, which would defecate on the streets which were attempted to be cleansed. Therefore, they were gradually replaced by mechanical street cleaning devices, which were introduced as early as 1911. Printing and photography A squeegee used for screen printing In screen printing, a squeegee is used to spread ink evenly across the back of a stencil or silkscreen, making a clean image on the printed surface. Screen-printing squeegees usually have much thicker and less flexible blades than the window cleaning variety. A squeegee is also used in photography printing on fabric to dry the photographic paper after it is washed, preventing wrinkles or water spots. The earliest reference to a squeegee used for drying in photography is an 1878 description by chemist and photographer William Abney of squeezing excess water away. His squeegee had no handle, and was \\"a flat bar of wood, into which is let a piece of india-rubber about 1/2 centimetre thick and 2 centimetres broad.\\" The user should note that \\"the india-rubber of the squeegee must be brought to bear with considerable pressure on to the surface of the paper, and the strokes made with it should commence from the centre and finish towards the ends.\\"W. de W. Abney, A treatise on photography, Longmans 1885, 3rd edition Sports The ice on skating rinks is resurfaced using a squeegee and other tools. Nowadays, they are all integrated in an ice resurfacer. Tennis courts sometimes have squeegees to help keep them dry and control the flow of water. Other uses Stiff-bladed squeegees are used in addition to margin trowels and grout floats to apply grout or adhesive when applying ceramic tiles to a surface. Squeegees with hard rubber or metal blades are used in stencil printing to apply solder paste to printed circuit boards (PCBs). Small, hand-held plastic and rubber wedges with an edge formed as a blade are used in signwriting for the application of vinyl sheeting to decrease the possibility of air pockets. Signwriters' squeegees come in different models, some of which do not have handles, but are approximately the size and shape of a credit card. A trick to remove pet hair is to use √† squeegee. Automobile squeegees are used in some universities to clean chalkboards. During the September 11 attacks in 2001, window washer Jan Demczur used a squeegee to free himself and five others from an elevator shaft in the World Trade Center in New York City.

Camps Camp Edward Camp Edward,Camp Edward previously known as Camp Brinkley, is a camp in Snohomish, Washington. It was founded in 1967 and originally held a resident summer camp program for Boy Scouts, but has since transitioned to a summer camp program for Cub Scouts. Camp Pigott Camp Pigott,Camp Pigott (named after former Paccar CEO and philanthropist Charles M. Pigott), has run a resident summer camp program since its re-opening in 2003. It had formerly been named Camp Omache, and had been closed since 1991. Camp Pigott sits on Lake Hughes in Snohomish, Washington. It features a 35' high-ropes course known as the C.O.P.E. course. The course is a non-linear design so Scouts can choose a variety of challenges and pathways. The camp also includes a 42' covered climbing tower with three climbing surfaces (including a real rock surface and overhang) and one, two- lane rappelling surface. Camp Pigott also has a mountain biking course and a blacksmith shop. The camp has a dining hall that is equipped with a full size industrial kitchen, and indoor/outdoor fireplace for the main hall. Camp Pigott is home of the Order of the Arrow T'Kope Kwiskwis Lodge's ceremonial longhouse. Camp Sheppard Camp Sheppard Camp Sheppard is a camp outside of Enumclaw, Washington. Sheppard does not run a resident Scout camping program, but does run several other Scout programs including a Winter Camp program for Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts. Since 2011, Sheppard has been the location for the Council's National Youth Leadership Training, usually holding four sessions every year in the summer. Until 2009, Camp Sheppard was a High Adventure base, where it offered programs in mountaineering, mountain biking, and backpacking. Until 2014, it hosted the \\"Mom & Me/Dad & Me\\" Cub Scout camping programs, after which they were moved to Camp Edward. Camp Parsons Founded in 1919, Camp Parsons is the oldest continuous running Boy Scout camp west of the Mississippi River and one of the oldest continually running Boy Scout camp in the United States on its original location.Eby, David L. \\"America's Oldest Scout Camps.\\" It sits on Jackson Cove, part of the Hood Canal, on the Olympic Peninsula, just north of Brinnon, Washington, and just south of Quilcene, Washington. The site of the camp was chosen by Professor Edmund Meany, Major Edward Ingraham and members of the Seattle Area Council. It was purchased from John Strom in May 1919 and named after the first council president, Reginald H. Parsons. Booth Hall (the current Silver Marmot Grill) was constructed in May and June 1919 and continues to be used today. On July 7, 1919, 100 Scouts arrived at Camp Parsons for its first season that ran 6 weeks and has not stopped since. A separate camp for Cub Scouts was developed on the property in 1937 and named Camp Meany in honor of the late Professor Edmund Meany, first Scout commissioner for Seattle. This camp was merged into Camp Parsons in 1941 and that camp's dining hall served as the dining hall for Camp Parsons until the summer 2014 after which it was raised and a new dining hall was constructed and dedicated in June 2015. Thousands of Scouts from the Pacific Northwest and throughout the United States and Canada attend camp each summer. Camp Parsons is the only Boy Scout Camp that uses a salt water beach for all aquatic activities. Camp Parsons also has hiking treks for Scouts to explore the Olympic Mountains and Kayak treks to explore the Hood Canal. Order of the Arrow Chief Seattle Council's local lodge in the Order of the Arrow is T'kope Kwiskwis, founded in 1954. The name translates to '[The Order of] the Silver Marmot' and refers to the council's original honor society that originated at Camp Parsons, the Silver Marmot. Unlike other lodges around the United States, which wear the Plains Indian style of regalia for their ceremonies, T'Kope, along with neighboring lodges wears button blankets. In April 2013, T'Kope Kwiskwis completed the reconstruction of a ceremonial longhouse at Camp Pigott that is used for Order of the Arrow ceremonies.http://www.tkopekwiskwis.org/longhouse/ The T'Kope Kwiskwis lodge won the 2012 OA National Service Award.

It was Breathed's fourth comic strip, following The Academia Waltz, Bloom County and Outland. Set in Bloom County, the satirical strip featured Breathed's character Opus the Penguin It was launched on November 23, 2003, and was syndicated by The Washington Post Writers Group. In early October 2008 the author declared he was terminating the strip because of his expectation that the United States is going to face tough times and his desire to depart from his most famous character \\"on a lighter note\\". Characters Opus Opus is the title character and protagonist of the strip. Though he returned to Antarctica at the end of Outland, Opus traveled back home to Bloom County, only to find that time has changed everything and everyone he once held dear. His employment usually depended on the week's joke ‚Äì since Opus began, he has so far been a political operative, a garbageman, and a newspaper ombudsman ‚Äì but he was most often depicted as a syndicated cartoonist. While his mother, maiden name Bougm, was no longer \\"long-lost,\\" she was not all he had imagined her to be after a decades-long search, and he was frequently seeking the comfort of an ideal mother-figure. In a 2003 interview with The A.V. Club, Breathed revealed that \\"Opus was named after a Kansas song.\\" (The band's 1976 album Leftoverture includes the song \\"Opus Insert\\" and a suite called \\"Magnum Opus\\".) He also added, \\"If you're too young to know who Kansas was, to hell with you.\\" Regular characters * Bill the Cat ‚Äì the first of Opus' old friends to re-emerge (just months into the strip), Bill seemed to be the only one completely unchanged by time. Still in a state of catatonia, he was occasionally tapped to run for political office but most often seen relaxing by Opus' side. He did not appear in many strips through the summer and fall of 2008, though. * Steve Dallas ‚Äì Steve was reintroduced little more than a year in, making him the only character to have appeared in a major role in all four of Breathed's comic strips. Steve, who had come out as gay at the end of Outland, was back to his former chauvinistic ways, apparently as a result of so-called \\"reparative therapy\\" (i.e., conversion therapy). Steve's lack of ability to charm women, however, remained. He had aged quite noticeably and appeared to be in his mid 50s, with graying temples and a receding hairline, but still retained his trademark sunglasses. * Pickles ‚Äì A little girl with a little bit of \\"snarky energy\\" (she first appeared as a self-proclaimed Viking princess), Pickles immediately began tagging along with Opus and Bill. She appeared much less frequently towards the end of the strip's run. * Auggie Dallas ‚Äì Steve's long lost son, reunited with his father after many years. He had nothing but admiration for Steve, even though Steve was sometimes reluctant to act like a father figure. His name may be a reference to Augie Doggie. * Michael Binkley ‚Äì A longtime friend of Opus who began appearing in the strip after a somewhat unexplained twelve-year absence (see below). He appeared as he did in Bloom County, inexplicably not aging as Steve Dallas had. Other characters * Senator Bedfellow ‚Äì Though previously convicted on corruption charges, Bedfellow returned later on, still usually drunk and plagued by reporters. * Editor of the Bloom Picayune ‚Äì Usually Opus' boss, the Picayune's editor was depicted as hyper-stressed and suicidal, though somewhat older than he was in Bloom County. * Oliver Wendell Jones ‚Äì For some reason, Oliver was shown, like Binkley, to be the same age as he had been in Bloom County and Outland. He reappeared on August 5, 2007. * Lola Granola ‚Äì Opus' one-time fianc√©e (back in the days of Bloom County), Lola reappeared on August 12, 2007 as Steve's girlfriend. * Berkeley Breathed ‚Äì On November 25, 2007, the cartoonist appeared as himself (using a likeness of Sean Connery as James Bond instead of drawing his own face) and \\"announced\\" that Jim Davis's character Garfield is gay in a parody of author J. K. Rowling's ex post facto outing of the Harry Potter character Albus Dumbledore. The strip ended with Breathed calling Rowling a \\"lily-livered literary chicken\\". Absent characters Early on in the strip, it was revealed that Michael Binkley had fled Bloom County to become a teenage Tibetan eunuch after a disastrous first kiss (this kiss was described to Binkley by his older self from his anxiety closet in Bloom County). He was not heard from again until June 3, 2007, when he appeared in his child form without explanation. At an autograph party for an Opus anthology book, Breathed revealed that the reason many of the original child characters had not returned is because in the years since the end of Outland, the child characters would have aged into teenagers, and Breathed had no interest in reviving the characters in that form. \\"Death\\" On August 31, 2008, \\"the Creator\\" (Berkeley Breathed) spoke to Opus and hinted that the strip will end soon. The next week, Opus was visited by the ghost of Elvis who told Opus to find a place where he wants to be forever, because he will stay in that one spot after he \\"dies.\\" e.g., Elvis is condemned to sit on the toilet forever because that's where he happened to be when he died. Opus tried to fly to a tropical island on September 14, but when he was asked for his passport, he told the ticket clerk that he smuggled himself into the U.S. 30 years ago. He was promptly arrested by airport security while screaming, \\"God Bless George Bush!\\" Opus was taken to the Department of Homeland Security and waterboarded. The guards told him to \\"start talking, Akbar!\\" Opus complained to \\"the Creator,\\" saying he couldn't just let the strip end like this. \\"The Creator\\" then placed Opus in an animal shelter, and mockingly said, \\"Happy?\\" to which Opus replied \\"NO!!\\" The next week, September 26, 2008, saw Opus bemoaning having to spend his eternity in a county animal shelter. At the behest of a fellow inmate, a scruffy dog, Opus soon began sharing his memories of his past and recounts his life through the run of Breathed's strips. Many shots of him in well-known stories from Bloom County are then shown, including Opus saying \\"bozo\\" to a politician on the TV in 1981, misunderstanding a money-grubbing cultist in 1982, sharing a mass dandelion break with other characters in 1983, his role in the rock band Deatht√∂ngue in 1984, dreaming romantically of Diane Sawyer in 1985, and a current joke about Sarah Palin set in 1986. The strip included a tag at the bottom indicating it would be continued the next week. At this point, a trio of island-native girls arrive at the shelter; they only have room for one companion to live with them in their paradise. On October 6, 2008, Breathed announced that the strip would end after November 2 that year, and even decided to do a contest for people to guess what Opus's fate is on BerkeleyBreathed.com. The winner will have $10,000 donated to the animal shelter of their choosing. On October 19, 2008, Steve Dallas was shown barging into the Bloom County Animal Shelter's lobby demanding to see Opus, claiming Opus owed him $20. The clerk stationed there informed Steve that Opus had chosen his final eternity and that Steve should do so likewise, and very quickly. The conversation ended with Steve finally realizing he was in a cartoon strip by breaking the fourth wall and asking the clerk who \\"all those scruffy-looking people [are]\\" as he looked at the readers, to which the clerk replied, \\"Probably Democrats at this point,\\" since he did this after dropping his towel, standing naked (but with a censor bar over his groin). The next week, Steve found the tropical island girls and told them to give back Opus. It was then revealed that Opus had let his doggy companion in the shelter go with the girls, said \\"goodnight\\", and returned to the kennel. After seeing a vision of former Bloom County residents (Milo, Binkley, Oliver, Cutter John, Portnoy, and Bill the Cat) waving goodbye as they rode off into the distance atop Cutter John's wheelchair, Steve walked back to the animal shelter to find nothing but Opus' bow tie and an empty kennel. The final strip showed a glowing light coming from a box inside the kennel. Steve reaches into the box, and smiles at what he sees. The panel showed the address of a link to the Humane Society, which displayed the last panel as part of the $10,000 contest (it would later be printed in Berkeley Breathed's Opus: The Complete Library). The final strip showed Steve opening a copy of Goodnight Moon and seeing Opus tucked in bed, sleeping peacefully with a mother rabbit watching over him. The 2015 revival of the Bloom County comic strip reveals that Opus is still alive, only that he has been unconscious the past 25 years and that the events of Opus and Outland were all an elaborate dream sequence. Production history In numerous interviews before launching Opus, Berke Breathed stated his hopes that the strip would help reinvigorate the medium of newspaper comics. He criticized many modern strips, especially Garfield, for lacking expressive artwork or original humor. In an interview appearing in the April 2007 issue of Texas Monthly, Breathed announced that he planned to end the strip by killing off the main character. On April 2, 2007 the journal Editor & Publisher reported on this interview in a story titled \\"Will Cartoonist Berkeley Breathed Kill Off Opus the Penguin?\\" However, Breathed's editor has reportedly quoted him as stating, \\"I mentioned Opus' literal death just for talking points on my [book] tour coming up. Not gonna kill him, but it's good for copy.\\" Breathed confirmed that he was joking in an interview with Salon: \\"I was kidding about killing Opus, by the way. I'd like to walk the streets free from fears of spontaneous garroting.\\" In August 2008, the strip began a sequence playing off the 2007 interview, as \\"the Creator\\" of the strip informed Opus that \\"the end is near.\\" The strip ended on Sunday, November 2, 2008, with Opus snugly in bed at the conclusion of Goodnight Moon. Artwork and availability The original syndication contract for Opus stipulated that the strip occupy an entire half of a newspaper page. According to The Washington Post Writers Group, this was to provide \\"space for Breathed to offer richness and depth, similar to the breathtaking imagery in his popular children's books.\\" While this style can appear hand-painted or airbrushed, it is actually rendered by Breathed on a computer using Adobe Photoshop. The half-page requirement was subsequently lifted, and the strip scaled down by most newspapers. Its original illustration style has also been largely abandoned in favor of a more hand-drawn look, much like that of Breathed's previous strip, Outland. Initially, in an effort to help boost physical newspaper sales, the strip was barred from appearing online; however, in 2005, that too changed and Opus became officially available on the web. On August 26, 2007, the strip featured Lola Granola wearing a headscarf, explaining that she was now a \\"radical Islamist.\\" The cartoon was not printed by the Washington Post and many other papers. The following week's strip was also censored. Both strips were replaced by more innocuous strips in the printed versions, but the 'objectionable' strips relating to Lola's religious beliefs were offered in a variety of Internet comics sites, including Breathed's homepage and the \\"My Comics Page\\" site. This site now requires a paid \\"pro\\" registration for access to the censored strips, but free access to the censored strips is still available online. The movie In August 2006 The Weinstein Company revealed in a press release for an animated version of The Nutty Professor that it had a \\"CG-animated project\\" called \\"Opus\\" \\"in the works\\". Numerous online movie databases, including The New York Times, have entries for the movie, titled Opus: The Last Christmas, and give a release date of December 19, 2008. Some of these sites name Berkeley Breathed as the director, while others list Tim Bjorklund and Paul Taylor. Initially, Miramax Films was reported to have obtained the movie rights to the series, but the project migrated to The Weinstein Company with the departure of the Weinstein brothers from Disney and Miramax. However, on May 8, 2007, during an interview by NPR radio host Diane Rehm, Mr. Breathed responded to an e-mail question regarding the existence of Opus: The Last Christmas by saying, In a June 2007 interview with Salon.com, Breathed confirmed that the Miramax feature was \\"dead\\", but left the door open for an independently produced Opus film: Reprints In 2012, The Library of American Comics published the complete Opus strip in their reprint series, Bloom County: The Complete Library.

Guru Ma ) (April 8, 1939 ‚Äì October 15, 2009) was an American spiritual leader, author, orator, and writer. In 1963 she married Mark L. Prophet (after ending her first marriage), who had founded The Summit Lighthouse in 1958. Mark and Elizabeth had four children. Elizabeth, after her second husband's death on February 26, 1973, assumed control of The Summit Lighthouse. In 1975 Prophet founded Church Universal and Triumphant, which became the umbrella organization for the movement, and which she expanded worldwide. She also founded Summit University and Summit University Press. In the late 1980s Prophet controversially called on her members to prepare for the possibility of nuclear war at the turn of the decade, encouraging them to construct fallout shelters. In 1996, Prophet handed day-to-day operational control of her organization to a president and board of directors. She maintained her role as spiritual leader until her retirement due to health reasons in 1999. During the 1980s and 1990s Prophet appeared on Larry King Live, Donahue and Nightline, among other television programs.

Early years Elizabeth Clare Prophet was born Elizabeth Clare Wulf at Monmouth Memorial Hospital in Long Branch, New Jersey on April 8, 1939, to Hans and Fridy Wulf. She grew up with her family in Red Bank, New Jersey during the Second World War. She describes her earliest childhood as idyllic. However, problems arose, such as the detention of her father as a suspected German spy in 1942. Upon his release he inspired her to help others who may also suffer because of their nationality, race, or religion. After seeing the horrors of the Holocaust in media and print, she became convinced of the reality of absolute evil in the world. This played a main role in her deciding to major in political science in her studies. One of the major difficulties in her early life was her father's addiction to alcohol. He verbally abused her mother and had a violent temper which he directed towards them and the destruction of his beloved fish tanks. After witnessing this for many years, Prophet became convinced that when the blood alcohol content creates a chemical imbalance in the body, possessing demons take over the mind and the emotions. In her early life, she periodically blacked out. This happened in the third grade, when she was about to say her lines in a Christmas play, and recurred throughout her life. Her condition was first diagnosed as petit mal epilepsy, known more commonly today as absence seizures. She did not find medication helpful, and discontinued using it. Her mother later confessed that in 1937 she took some pills in an unsuccessful attempt to abort her pregnancy with Elizabeth. Prophet thought her mother was implying the medication may have contributed to her childhood blackouts. Prophet herself did some research, and learned the use of quinine sulphate could have damaged the developing nervous system and the brain. Elizabeth Wulf claimed mystical experiences while growing up. She claimed that when she was about four, she had a vision of herself playing on the sands of the Nile river in Egypt. (Her mother told her that it was a past life.) She claimed that as a child she felt God's light around her naturally, and heard a sound in her inner ear like that of an ocean wave or the roar of Niagara Falls. While water-skiing, she said she felt she was suspended in a place where other spiritual beings existed, who were joyous in the light, radiating love. This motivated her to find out more about who these \\"saints robed in white\\" (Rev. 7:9-17) were, for she had always believed in the \\"universality of all true religion\\". Influences Wulf grew up in a home that was mainly non-religious except for major holidays. Her father was Lutheran, her mother Catholic. Yet it was her mother's interests in Theosophy, the I AM Activity, and Christian Science that had the most influence on her. In Theosophy and the I AM Activity she heard about the Ascended Masters, Karma, and Reincarnation; in Christian Science she was told that matter was not the only reality and that the spirit part of us made in the image of God was our true nature. Prophet stayed with Christian Science until she met Mark Prophet at the age of 22. Education Wulf spent her junior year studying French in Switzerland in 1956, and a year later graduated from Red Bank Regional High School ranked second in her class. She attended Antioch College in Ohio from September 1957 to March 1959 majoring in political science and economics. She transferred to Boston University in September 1959, and graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in political science in August 1961. Career In the summer of 1958, Wulf took a co-op job as a camp counselor in a French immersion school in Vermont. She was in charge of a number of high school girls between 15 and 16 years old and her role was to discipline them. She described the experience as frustrating and said she ended up praying to God she might never be put in a position of authority over others. Elizabeth Clare Prophet in front of the chapel at the summit of Croagh Patrick, Ireland, 1980 In the fall of 1958 she served an internship at the United Nations as secretary for Leo Rosenthal, a UN photographer. Her experience at the UN showed her that many of the ambassadors were not there to solve the world‚Äôs problems. Rather they were engaged in power politics and manipulation of the world‚Äôs economies. When she left after three months, she was depressed, and held the opinion that, to solve the world‚Äôs problems people would need to change their concept of themselves and God. After moving to Boston in 1959, she worked as a secretary for the Christian Science church and the Christian Science Monitor. According to Prophet that is where she learned much about the publishing operations, organization, and administration of a church on a worldwide scale. This would help her later in running her own church. Wulf claimed she had realized she was intended to be a messenger while meditating with Mark L. Prophet at a public meeting in Boston on April 22, 1961. He had come to teach what he called \\"the Ascended Masters\\". She later claimed to have received a vision, while meditating with him, that her role in life was to pass on a higher teaching to further humanity's spiritual evolution. She confided to Mark the next day she was also to be a messenger like him. He accepted her as a student at his mystical school, The Summit Lighthouse. She said she received another vision in June of that year by way of a visitation by the Ascended Master, El Morya, who told her to go to Washington, D.C. to be trained as messenger. After she attended her first conference in Washington in July, Mark Prophet returned to Boston in August to help her move to Washington to begin her training under him. After her first marriage ended in divorce, they married in 1963 and, upon his death on February 26, 1973, Prophet assumed leadership of the organization. In 1981 the Church Universal and Triumphant purchased the Forbes Ranch just outside Yellowstone Park, near Gardiner, Montana. In 1986, Prophet relocated her headquarters to that property. Teachings The dogma of The Summit Lighthouse included a doctrine called the Path of Personal Christhood, or the way of the soul's one-on-one relationship with God through Christ consciousness. Prophet believed she shared the gift of the word, both written and spoken. She claimed to be in constant communion with God. The Science of the Spoken Word, as Elizabeth and Mark taught it, was thought to be a gift of sound combined with meditation, prayer and visualization. They believed that a Divine Gift (The Ascension) of union with God was possible. Prophet predicted nuclear war would cause the end of the world in March 1990. Adherents started construction of a large bomb shelter in the church compound in Corwin Springs, Montana on land purchased from magazine publisher Malcolm Forbes. Construction was halted by court order when large amounts of stored diesel fuel leaked and contaminated the area.  Final years and death  Prophet was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in November 1998 and died on October 15, 2009, in Bozeman, Montana. Her five children‚ÄîErin, Moira, Tatiana, Sean and Seth‚Äîwere all still alive at the time of her death. In 2009, her daughter Erin Prophet published Prophet's Daughter: My Life with Elizabeth Clare Prophet Inside the Church Universal and Triumphant, and, in 2016, contributed a chapter to The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements.The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements ed.James R. Lewis, Inga B. Tollefsen - 2016 Page 48 0190466170 None of her five children are involved in or support her organization. Erin Prophet was chosen by Elizabeth as her successor but declined this role. Sean Prophet is an avowed atheist, renouncing all religions, including his mother‚Äôs church.

He is especially noted for his discovery of the pottery of the town of Mata Ortiz, Chihuahua, Mexico. Personal life MacCallum graduated from Princeton University with a Bachelors in art history and received a Masters of Arts in social anthropology from the University of Washington. He specialized in studying the life, culture and stateless society of Northwest Coast Indians.Spencer MacCallum: \\"Looking Back and Forward\\", Lewrockwell.com, December 19, 2003. MacCallum is the grandson of Spencer Heath, inventor and dissenter from mainstream Georgism. Career In 1956, MacCallum and his grandfather founded the Science of Society Foundation, which published a number of works including Heath's book Citadel, Market, and Altar. MacCallum was for many years an active researcher and lecturer for academic and business clients.Spencer Heath McCallum, The Art of Community, Institute for Humane Studies, 1970, back cover. He remains a Research Fellow at the Independent Institute.The Independent Institute page on Spencer MacCallum. MacCallum shared his grandfather's interest in multi-tenant properties where developers lease properties and are responsible for providing community services, thereby replacing the functions traditionally provided by the state. He details these ideas in his 1970 booklet The Art of Community, as well as his 2003 articles \\"The Enterprise of Community: Market Competition, Land, and Environment\\" and \\"Looking Back and Forward\\" (which describes the influence of his grandfather); and his 2005 article on stateless social organization \\"From Upstate New York to the Horn of Africa\\". In 2005, MacCallum also edited and published The Law of the Somalis by Michael van Notten. The book deals with the foundations of the Somali customary law (Xeer). Through his grandfather, MacCallum met alternative currency theorist E.C. Riegel. After Riegel's death, MacCallum obtained all Riegel's papers, which now reside with the Heather Foundation, of which MacCallum is director.The Phoenix Forum sponsors list During the 1970s MacCallum re-published Riegel's books \\"The New Approach to Freedom\\" and \\"Private Enterprise Money\\" and collected his papers into a new book called Flight from Inflation: The Monetary Alternative.E.C. Riegel, The New Approach to Freedom, Editorial preface by Spencer MacCallum, San Pedro, CA, The Heather Foundation, 1979 edition. In 1976, MacCallum discovered artisan Juan Quezada, who soon became the leader of the now-thriving pottery movement located in Mata Ortiz, a small town near the ancient Paquime (or Casas Grandes) ruins in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. McCallum is the author of many articles on Mata Ortiz, as well as introduction to the book, Portraits of Clay: Potters of Mata Ortiz. His efforts helped the pottery win acceptance as a contemporary art form and a legitimate folk art. MacCallum lives in nearby Casas Grandes, and still plays a key role in Mata Ortiz affairs. Additionally, MacCallum has assisted archaeological investigations in the region by providing a compound to serve as quarters and lab space. Bibliography * Spencer H. MacCallum: \\"E.C.

Personal life Born Victoria Camargo, Wyndham is the daughter of Florence Skeels and Mexican-American stage and screen actor Ralph Camargo. Her sister is stage actress Felice Camargo. Wyndham's sons are actor Christian Camargo (n√© Christian Minnick) and photographer Darian Minnick. Early career Wyndham first started her acting career as understudy in the role of Hodel in the Broadway production of Fiddler on the Roof. She went on to perform cabaret with Lily Tomlin for two years at Upstairs at the Downstairs. Daytime television credits As Rachel with George Reinholt on Another World, 1973. Wyndham as Rachel marries Mac Cory, 1975. Her father, Ralph, was the justice of the peace for the scene. It was the first time the two had acted together. Wyndham first made a name for herself when she played Charlotte Waring Fletcher Bauer, (posing as Tracy Delmar) on the soap opera Guiding Light from 1967 to 1971. When she left The Guiding Light, she became a hot commodity in casting circles, with many soap operas offering contracts to her. She admitted in a TIME magazine interview that she almost did not follow through with a career in soap operas. Wyndham said, \\"When I first went into soaps, I didn't tell my serious acting friends. I thought they'd laugh. But now I'm proud of my work; some of the best acting, best moments are in this medium.\\" She was subsequently cast on the soap opera Another World in the role of Rachel, for which she is perhaps best known. Wyndham succeeded actress Robin Strasser in the role and portrayed Rachel from 1972 until the show ended in 1999. When Wyndham took over the role from Strasser, the character was a villain. The head writer at the time, Harding Lemay, was impressed by Wyndham's range and decided to take the character in different directions. The character of Rachel was reformed after being paired with a much-older book publisher, Mackenzie Cory (Douglass Watson). It made Wyndham very popular with fans and proved to be very lucrative as well. Although highly regarded, Wyndham did have one peculiar run-in with a fan: author Annie Gilbert, in the book All My Afternoons, noted that Wyndham was mildly assaulted when an enraged fan, fed up with Rachel's scheming ways and thinking Wyndham was her character, attempted to punch her at a Lord & Taylor store in New York City, all the while screaming, \\"I hate you! I hate you!\\" In the later years of the program, Wyndham took on the double role of Justine Duvalier, Rachel's new husband Carl's ex-lover. She played the dual role for two years (1995 and 1996) before Justine was killed off. Wyndham was honored with a special episode showcasing her noteworthy performances on Another World in July 1997. At the time of the show's cancellation, she was the longest- running performer on the series. Current work Wyndham appeared in an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit on January 2, 2007, as \\"Rita Colino,\\" a former wife of the dead partner of Brian Dennehy's character.

They differ to a degree from spin-offs, in that they are established independently from one another. The popularity of most series is limited to a few seasons, and sister shows allow expanding the immediate audience and ratings share. This is accomplished by using mostly different actors and production facilities. Sister shows often shift styles or target audience slightly, for a larger overall market. Thus The Beverly Hillbillies emphasizes slapstick, while Green Acres emphasizes surreal humor. Examples * Arrow, Constantine, The Flash, Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow and Batwoman. * Daredevil, The Punisher, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, Luke Cage, and The Defenders. * The Real World and Road Rules * Band of Brothers and The Pacific. * The King of Queens and Everybody Loves Raymond. * Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Xena, Warrior Princess and Young Hercules. :The character Xena proved popular on Hercules and a second series started. * All My Children and One Life to Live (which join General Hospital). :From 2004 to 2005, they featured a crossover storyline told on both series. * Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis and Stargate Universe. :Stargate Atlantis premiered during the eighth season of Stargate SG-1.

The original dish is often made of fish, either freshwater or sea, (known as Viszooitje), though today chicken waterzooi (Kippenwaterzooi) is more common. The most accepted theory is that rivers around Ghent became too polluted and the fish there disappeared. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor ate the rich dish, even after suffering from gout.Patricia Carson, Fair Face of Flanders (Belgian Art Research Institute, 2001), p. 124.

The stew itself contains fish or chicken, vegetables including carrots, onions, celeriac, leeks, potatoes and herbs such as parsley, thyme, bay-leaves and sage. Fish Originally, burbot was used but this fish had all but disappeared from the rivers until its recent return due to conservation efforts. Nowadays, fish such as eel, pike, carp and bass are used, though other fish such as cod, monkfish, or halibut can be used. Gentse Waterzooi van Tarbot includes turbot.

Background Bull was educated at Dulwich College in south east London, between 1970 and 1977 where he was a leading light of the tape-based \\"College Radio\\". He has a degree in Educational Broadcasting from the University of London and a distinction in Radio Journalism from The National Broadcasting School. He joined LBC as a telephone operator. He worked as a producer for Steve Allen's LBC show Nightline and later went on to review books for the same show. Later he presented a range of programmes including gardening phone-ins and the station's youth programme Young London. His big break was as host of the overnight Clive Bull Through the Night Show which ran for several years in the early 1990s. In 1994 he was hired by London News Talk 1152 (as LBC's AM service was briefly known) to host the weekend late-night slot. The following year he moved to weeknights where he remained for 16 years. LBC radio show Bull's show aired live Sunday to Thursday from 10pm to 1am. With slight variations in show times, Bull occupied the same late night slot from 1995 to 2011 despite numerous changes of station brand and ownership during this time. Discussions tended to focus around two or three topics each evening based loosely upon what is in the news, or what interested or affected Bull. However, he encouraged callers to talk about whatever they liked, on the basis that more interesting discussions come from things people genuinely care about. There were special-interest nights, including the successful science hour series with Brian J. Ford. Between 1999 and 2007 Bull's show was produced by Bob Johnson, who produced his last show on Thursday 20 December 2007. Previous producer Dan Wright went on to work for Independent Television News and CNN. The 1991 short television programme Night Caller followed the callers to Bull's through-the-night show. In June 2011, Bull said he would be taking a break from talk radio, stating that: \\"After thirty wonderful years with LBC, I'm looking forward to being up all day and going to bed at a sensible hour\\". Bull was succeeded on the Late Show by his friend and former LBC colleague Anthony Davis. Less than a year later, Bull returned to LBC presenting Sunday to Thursday from 7pm to 10pm, starting on Easter Sunday 2012. In September 2018, LBC announced a new autumn schedule. Bull moved to weekends to present Saturday 6-8pm and Sundays 6-9pm shows. In January 2019 these were changed to Saturday 6-10pm & Sunday 6-9pm. In September 2020 these were changed to Saturday 1-4am & Sunday 1-4am. Acclaim In June 2005, Bull came 19th in the Radio Times survey of the forty most powerful people on radio, the highest ranked phone-in host. He was described as \\"a brilliant phone-in host who knows that the way to make captivating talk radio is not to rant or rage, but to create a separate world, away from the nonsense of current affairs ‚Äì then invite his listeners into it. His show is the most listened-to night-time programme in London and is an understated joy,\\" while The Independent called him \\"The Emperor of night-time talk radio.\\" The Observer said of Bull: \\"There's no-one quite like him. You get the impression that he's living just a bit dangerously, and that's what makes phone-ins exciting\\". He has won several awards including a Bronze Sony Radio Award. The judges described him \\"An exception to the run-of-the-mill phone-in. It was all down to the presenter who appeared so laid back that his callers could not see how he was teasing them. A very dry sense of humour and great fun.\\" He won Best Talk Show Host at the New York Radio Awards in 2001. Celebrity callers *Peter Cook made a series of calls with the pseudonym \\"Sven from Swiss Cottage\\", a Norwegian fisherman who had come to London looking for romance and to escape the fish- obsessed phone-ins of Norway. Over time, Cook created an elaborate story of Sven's attempts to find love, or to find his estranged wife, often claiming to call from remote parts of the world where he believed his wife may have gone.

It drains a low mountainous area east of the Columbia, passing through the Spokane Valley and the city of Spokane, Washington.

Roosevelt Lake, approximately 180 km downstream.National Research Council, 2005: p. 92Soltero et al., 1994: p. 460 From Lake Coeur d'Alene, the Spokane River traverses the Rathdrum Prairie until reaching Post Falls, Idaho where it passes over a dam, and a natural 40-foot waterfall. Continuing westward it passes over 6 more dams, three of which (Upriver Dam, Upper Falls Dam, Monroe Street Dam) are located in the city of Spokane. In Spokane, it flows over the Spokane Falls, which are located in the heart of Downtown Spokane, approximately one third of the way down the river's length. About a mile later, the river receives Latah Creek from the southeast. Soon afterwards, it is met from the northeast by the Little Spokane River, on the western edge of the city of Spokane. It flows in a zigzag course along the southern edge of the Selkirk Mountains, forming the southern boundary of the Spokane Indian Reservation, where it is impounded by the Long Lake Dam to form Long Lake, a 15 mi (24 km) reservoir. It joins Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake on the Columbia from the east at Miles. The site of historic Fort Spokane is located at the confluence of the Spokane and Columbia rivers.National Park Service.

Today, the metropolitan area of the city of Spokane, Washington (population 213,272) is the largest human settlement on the banks of the Spokane River. The metropolitan areas of Coeur d'Alene and Post Falls, Idaho (pop. 200,000) are also seated alongside the river. The Spokane River and Lake Coeur d'Alene are the primary sources of recharge for the Spokane Valley‚ÄìRathdrum Prairie Aquifer, which is the primary source of drinking water for each of these settlements.National Research Council, 2005: p. 93 Pollution The Spokane River contains some of the highest concentrations of heavy metals of any river in the state, resulting from pollution coming from Lake Coeur D'Alene and traveling from the Bunker Hill Mine and Smelting Complex Superfund Site.Rosen, J.F., Science of the Total Environment, Volume: 303 Issue: 1-2, Pages: 15-23, Published: February 15, 2003 Spokane's sewage treatment facilities empty their outflow into the Spokane River. In 1889, Spokane built a sewage system that dumped raw sewage directly into the river, which was visibly noticeable by 1920. In 1957 a primary treatment facility was installed; however, this was soon deemed inadequate by the Washington State Department of Ecology. This led to the construction of a more advanced treatment plant that utilized chemical precipitation technology, which was connected in 1975, and operational by 1977. Fish habitat Long Lake Dam on the Spokane River, the construction of which wiped out the salmon populations that used to travel upstream. After the Northern Pacific Railway lines arrived in Spokane in 1882, there was rapid growth in milling operations along the river. Many of these mills required dams to provide power for their machinery. As a result of the dams blocking the river, salmon populations in the Spokane plummeted, leading to complaints from many of the people living upstream. After the construction of Little Falls Dam in 1910 by Washington Water Power blocked upstream passage, the river's salmon populations disappeared completely.Fahey, John (1991); \\"Power Plays: The Enigma of Little Falls,\\" Pacific Northwest Quarterly 82, no.4 (October 1991), 122-131. Steelhead were also abundant on the Spokane River, prior to pollution and the construction of the dams. Today, the Spokane River system is one of the two largest unoccupied stretches of steelhead habitat within their former range. Today, the Spokane River supports populations of rainbow trout, northern pikeminnow, and Bridgelip Suckers (Catostomus columbianus), as well as several non-native species. Many of the remaining fish, however, are not suitable for human consumption due to the chemical pollution in the river, with signs alongside the river warning that the fish are contaminated with PCBs.

It serves to provide coordination and support for affiliated MSA chapters in colleges across North America. Established in 1963, the organization now has chapters in colleges across the continent, and is the precursor of the Islamic Society of North America and several other Islamic organizations. The Muslim Students Association has at times been the subject of scrutiny; for example, the New York Police Department (NYPD) targeted MSAs across several US college campuses for monitoring as part of their Muslim surveillance program. Organization The Muslim Students Association of the U.S. and Canada is also known as MSA National. It is an umbrella organization for all of affiliated chapters at various campuses across the continent. Local chapters are only loosely connected with the parent institution, and often take different names, such as \\"Islamic Students Association\\", or \\"Muslim Discussion Group\\". Not all campus Muslim groups are necessarily affiliated with MSA National. There is no fixed hierarchy between MSA National and local chapters; as such, the policies and views of the national organization are not necessarily shared by local chapters. The United States and Canada are divided into five zones, three in the US and two in Canada. Each zone has a zonal representative, chosen by the members of the affiliated chapters within that zone. Chapters make up regional councils. History The first MSA National chapter was formed in 1963 at the campus of University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign (UIUC) by international students. The initial leadership came from Arabic-speaking and Urdu-speaking members, with guidance from students of the Egyptian-based Muslim Brotherhood and Pakistan-based Jamaat-e-Islami Islami movements. A Saudi Arabian charity, the wahhabist Muslim World League, provided early funding for the group. Early goals for the movement included the promotion of \\"a self-definition [that] involves initially and fundamentally [an] Islamic identity\\" of its members, as well as an appropriate Islamic lifestyle while they were in the US. With time, MSA groups became more interested in seeking how to integrate and institutionalize Islam and Islamic culture into American life. Current issues such as the position of women in Islam and problems in the Islamic countries began to be debated. The groups proved important as mobilizers in developing increasing Muslim political activity in the United States. Student leaders, as these graduated, went on to form the Islamic Society of North America. From the 1960s onwards, the MSA engaged in educational activities, including the translation and publishing of works by major Islamic scholars. In 1966 MSA founded the Islamic Book Service, to distribute magazines and books. In addition, books about Islam were distributed on campuses to both Muslims and non-Muslims. In the 1970s, a fiqh, or legal council was established by MSA; initially the fiqh rendered opinions on minor issues such as the start of Ramadan. By 1988, however, it was making decrees on a broad range of religious and social issues. In 1994, after nearly 12 years of being virtually defunct, MSA National's leadership held a first- ever strategic planning retreat at the University of Michigan, bringing 27 undergraduate and graduate students from around the US and Canada together. This retreat would spark the re-emergence of MSA National as an independent, unique organization with a dedicatedly first and second generation focus. Nearly all of the 27 students were born or raised in the US and Canada, and were of the next generation of North American Muslims, signifying a radical shift in MSA National's future direction. From 1994 onward, MSA National held conferences on college campuses, convention centers and mosques around the US and Canada, with no guidance and direction from any other group or organization. Fifteen years later, by 2010, yet another generation was poised to take the leadership of MSA National. Activities such as Project Downtown, the Fast-athon, and other regional and national projects were born. Now all of MSA National's leadership was born in the US and/or Canada, and MSA began to make its own decisions and take positions on a variety of issues without regard to other groups or organizations. Activities Today, the organization is present in various forms on several campuses across the United States and Canada. In contrast to early membership, members are now frequently American-born Muslims. Activities include prayer times, lectures, discussion, and social events, and seek to unify Muslim students from different cultural backgrounds. At a campus level, groups lobby universities for recognition of Islamic holidays and prayer times, the availability and size of prayer rooms and for the provision of religiously permitted food on campus. MSAs engaged in various charitable activities. They raise funds through events known as \\"Fast- A-Thons\\", which originated at the University of Tennessee. The MSA launched a \\"Peace ... not Prejudice\\" campaign to dispel stereotypes and paint Islam in a positive light. Islam Awareness Week Islam Awareness Week was a project started in the early 1990s by the Muslim Students Association of the United States and Canada. Its aim was to introduce Islam on a unified platform to all university and college campuses. During this week, each MSA offers information through a variety of resources and organizes activities in order to promote an understanding of Islamic principles and ideals. Information on Islam is presented in forms of topic tailored tables, free literature, and also through dialogue. Activities may include speeches given by prominent Muslim figures, interactive games, movie showings, or a night of Islamic entertainment and traditional ethnic dinners. Islam Awareness Week seeks to promote a positive understanding of Islam throughout the university community and hopes to build and strengthen connections and relationships within the university community for the promotion and recognition of Muslim North Americans. Controversies Aafia Siddiqui's possible radicalization at MIT Suspected al-Qaeda member Aafia Siddiqui was active in the MSA at MIT when she attended there in the 1990s and was known for participating in charity for Islamic organizations. Journalist Deborah Scroggins, in exploring how Siddiqui might have become an Islamist extremist, wrote for Vogue that if Siddiqui \\"was drawn into terrorism, it may have been through the contacts and friendships she made in the early 1990s working for MIT's Muslim Students Association. Members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the world's oldest and biggest Islamist movement, established the first MSAs in the country... and the movement's ideology continued to influence the MSA long after that. At MIT, several of the MSA's most active members followed the teachings of Abdullah Azzam, a Muslim Brother who was Osama bin Laden's mentor.\\" According to Scroggins article, \\"[Azzam] had established the Al Kifah Refugee Center to function as its worldwide recruiting post, propaganda office, and fund-raising center for the mujahideen fighting in Afghanistan. ... It would become the nucleus of the al-Qaeda organization.\\" Muslim Student Union at the University of California, Irvine The University of California Irvine Muslim Student Union is an affiliated chapter of MSA National, which was suspended for the 2010‚Äì11 school year for disrupting a speech given by Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren at a university sponsored event. The students claimed they were exercising their right to protest and free speech The program is being organized in conjunction with American Muslims for Palestine, a Chicago-based group that is dedicated to training college and high school students to advocate for Palestinian rights, speaking out against Israeli policy and military action that unjustly affects Palestinians. New York Police Department monitoring of MSAs The NYPD illegally monitored Muslim student associations in the Northeast US, citing a list of 12 people arrested or convicted on terrorism charges in the United States and abroad who had once been members of Muslim student associations. In rationalizing their monitoring activities, the NYPD noted they followed the same rules as the FBI, but several civil rights organizations argued that they engaged in unconstitutional racial and religious profiling and spying without evidence against individuals. The universities involved in the student monitoring included Yale; Columbia; the University of Pennsylvania; Syracuse; New York University; Clarkson University; the Newark and New Brunswick campuses of Rutgers; the State University of New York campuses in Buffalo, Albany, Stony Brook and Potsdam; Queens College; Baruch College; Brooklyn College and La Guardia Community College. In one monitoring incident, a conference which was to be attended by MSA students included Siraj Wahaj, a prominent but controversial New York imam who has attracted the attention of authorities for years.. As a result of ongoing spying through undercover police and informants, the covert program introduced distrust of law enforcement and a culture of community fear and stigma. In June 2012, MSA National, along with other plaintiffs, filed suit against the City of New York, in New Jersey federal court. Civil Action Complaint, Muslim Advocates (www.muslimadvocates.com, accessed November 12, 2012).CBS News: New Jersey Muslim Group Sues NYPD to Stop Routine Spying The suit alleges, on behalf of two New Jersey MSA chapters, that plaintiffs were deprived of their Free Exercise rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and seeks to force the NYPD to expunge all data, information and conclusions regarding the Plaintiffs compiled by the NYPD. Racism and Arab/South-Asian bias In the 1970s, the MSA conducted a survey which showed that most \\"felt like there weren‚Äôt enough efforts to include [African-American Muslims]\\" and African-American students at MSAs across the country have offered their stories of exclusion and marginalization within the organization, saying that efforts to talk about race in the community are often met with resistance or dismissal. The Black In MSA hashtag (or #BlackInMSA) generated discussion of the stereotypes and racism which African- American students were subject to in the MSA from Arab and South-Asian members. This included reluctance to engage with issues affecting African- American students on campus, reluctance to talk about racism, and hesitation or outright refusal to support African-American students and communities in the Black Lives Matter / LGBTQ movements. Muslim Students' Associations have been generally accused of harboring prejudice views against non-Arab members. Social media users complained of bias from Arab Muslim members towards African-American Muslims members, including the use of the Arabic term for slave (Abdeed). Additionally, there has been discrimination accused by non- Arab members of the group in the appointment of leadership positions within the MSA. The group has also been criticized for only bringing to attention and protesting issues in the Arab world, such as the Palestine conflict or the Syrian War, while ignoring other issues concerning Muslims such as the Kashmir conflict and the Rohingya persecution in Myanmar.

The image shows the complete multi-layer suit and positive-pressure helmet, lacking only the backpack. (taken ~1971) A mechanical counterpressure (MCP) suit or space activity suit (SAS) is an experimental spacesuit which applies stable pressure against the skin by means of skintight elastic garments. The SAS is not inflated like a conventional spacesuit: it uses mechanical pressure, rather than air pressure, to compress the human body in low-pressure environments. Development was begun by NASA and the Air Force in the late 1950s and then again in the late 1960s, but neither design was used. Research is under way at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on a \\"Bio- Suit\\" System which is based on the original SAS concept. Background The human body can briefly survive exposure to the hard vacuum of space unprotected, despite contrary depictions in some popular science fiction. Human skin does not need to be protected from vacuum and is gas-tight by itself. Human flesh expands to about twice its size in such conditions, giving the visual effect of a body builder rather than an overfilled balloon. This can be counteracted through mechanical counter-pressure from a suitably designed garment. Consciousness is retained for up to 15 seconds as the effects of oxygen starvation set in. Counteracting this requires a helmet to contain breathing gases and protect the ears and eyes.Space Activity Suit, Astronautics.com These effects have been confirmed through various accidents in very high altitude conditions, outer space, and training vacuum chambers.  Cooling  Cooling of the astronaut with an SAS is generally achieved with evaporation from body perspiration which is emitted from the suit in all directions. Water, salts, and proteins can deposit on optics and other sensitive surfaces causing damage or degradation. This can limit the usefulness of an SAS. For the inflated spacesuits used on the space shuttle, International Space Station, and the Apollo program, cooling was achieved in the Primary Life Support System by sublimation of water in a vacuum. Designs Mauch In 1959 Hans Mauch was working on \\"breathable\\" undergarments for the Mercury space suit when he hit upon the idea of a way to build a mechanical counterpressure design. The Mauch team noticed that closed- cell foams, which trap gas within their structure, expand when outside pressure is lowered. By containing the foam within a non-expanding outer layer, it would place increasing pressure on the body as the pressure lowered. This appeared to allow for a design that would offer far better mobility than the almost rigid Mercury design.Kenneth Thomas and Harold McMann, \\"U.S. Spacesuits\\", Springer, 2012, pp. 209-211 Late in 1959 Mauch Laboratories was granted a contract by the US Air Force to develop a working model, as part of the Air Force's secret X-20 Dynasoar efforts. The program ran until 1962, during which time NASA had joined the effort. The suit was built with a layer of foam sandwiched between two layers of fabric, the inner against the wearer's skin (or undergarments) to provide mechanical support, and the outer providing containment. A separate, and bulky, helmet provided pressure and breathing gases. Like the undergarments that Mauch was developing for Mercury, thermal control was provided by direct sweat transpiration through the fabric. The resulting suit was about as bulky as the original Mercury design, excluding the large helmet. Extended vacuum testing was carried out successfully, but the suit proved to have less mobility than expected and further development was dropped. Webb The introduction of improved fabrics led to Paul Webb's concept for a new way to build an SAS. Further work was contracted in order to test various design concepts. Between 1968 and 1971 ten designs of increasing sophistication were built, leading eventually to a series of successful tests in vacuum chambers. The longest test was two hours and forty-five minutes. The tests were successful: the practicality of a mechanical counter pressure spacesuit was demonstrated conclusively. The energy needed to move about was considerably less than conventional designs, which was a major improvement for long-duration spacewalks. Tests of punctures showed that up to a square millimeter of skin could be directly exposed to vacuum for extended periods with no permanent effect. A similar puncture in a conventional suit would result in a loss of pressure and breathing air. It weighed half as much as the primary pressure suit worn by NASA astronauts for Project Apollo, the A7L. A number of problems also turned up, primarily related to the problem of keeping the suit in strong mechanical contact at every point on the body. Concavities or small folds in the fabric could lead to fluid pooling in the gaps; the groin area proved extremely difficult to tailor successfully. To correct this, small pads of polyurethane foam were inserted into concavities and were successful in most problem areas. The suits had to be tailored to each individual, although the same was true of all space suits of the era. The largest difficulty was donning and removing the suit. In order to effectively provide the minimum pressure of necessary for human physiology, the suit had to be extremely tight-fitting, making donning and doffing a highly strenuous task. In 1971, Webb, along with James F. Annis, published their findings in a report. The report remained positive, and the researchers felt that further improvements were possible. Quoting the Report: The original SAS design was based on two new fabrics: a type of \\"powernet\\" (or \\"girdle fabric\\") for high-tension areas, and an elastic bobbinet weave for lower-tension areas. Both were based on a heavy elastic warp thread with a much less elastic weft thread to form a netting. The terms warp and weft are used loosely here, as the material was not woven using traditional means. Powernet used Spandex cord as the warp with nylon cord as the weft, allowing movement primarily along the warp axis. Bobbinet used cotton-wrapped rubber warp and nylon or Dacron weft, and was flexible in both directions. The cotton wrapping limited the maximum stretch to 200% of the rest length. The amount of over-pressure bobbinet could create was about over the torso, the largest volume, and up to over smaller radius curves on the wrist and ankles. Powernet could produce about even on the torso. A minimum of is needed for normal breathing. Multiple layers and patches of the two materials were used to control the overall mechanical pressure around the body. Starting at the skin, a \\"slip layer\\" of light powernet was used to allow the outer layers to slide over the skin without binding. Under this layer a number of foam pads were placed on various concavities on the body to keep them in contact with the suit. On top of this was the counter-pressure bladder, part of the breathing system. On top of this were up to six additional layers of powernet over the trunk with bobbinet arms and legs, or all-bobbinet garments covering the trunk only. The garments were put on like a normal bodysuit with a large zipper closing the front, with additional drawstrings at some points to help close the garment. Zippers on alternating layers were offset. The positive-pressure breathing system consisted of three main portions: the pressurized helmet, the breathing bladder, and the tankage system in a backpack. The bladder and helmet were connected together to pump air out of the bladder and over the torso when the user breathed in, reducing the amount of pressure on the user's chest. The helmet was secured by means of a non-elastic garment of Nomex cloth which wrapped around the chest and under the arms, and by the elastic layers above and below it. MIT Bio-Suit MIT Bio Suit next to the Mars Mark III planetary hard suit. The Bio-Suit is an experimental space activity suit under construction at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the direction of professor Dava Newman, with support from the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts. Similar to the SAS in concept, the BioSuit applies advances in engineering and measurement to produce a simplified version of the SAS design.Astronaut Bio-Suit for Exploration Class Missions: NIAC Phase I Report, 2001 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.111.7588&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf Newman has worked extensively in biomechanics, especially in the field of computerized measurement of human movement. As with gas-filled suits, Newman has used the principle of \\"lines of non-extension\\", a concept originated by Arthur Iberall in work dating back to the late 1940s, to place the tension elements along lines of the body where the skin does not stretch during most normal movements. The primary structure of the BioSuit is built by placing elastic cords along the lines of non-extension. Thus, whatever pressure they provide will be constant even as the wearer moves. In this way, they can control the mechanical counter-pressure the suit applies. The rest of the suit is then built up from spandex lying between the primary pressure cords. The Bio-Suit team has thus far constructed a number of lower leg prototypes using different materials, including nylon-spandex, elastic, and urethane-painted foam. In one experimental design, kevlar fabric was used between cords for areas where the expansion was limited. At least one full-body suit has been constructed for Newman, which she has worn for numerous photo-ops; it is unknown if the entire suit meets the same counter-pressure standards that the lower-leg prototypes were designed for. Each suit has to be custom tailored for the wearer, but the complexity of this task is reduced through the use of whole-body laser scans. The result is a one-layer version of the SAS; it is lighter than the original and more flexible, allowing more natural motion and decreasing the energy cost of motion. Versions of portions of the BioSuit have consistently reached , and the team is currently aiming for . As mechanical counter-pressure has proven difficult for small joints such as those in the hands, the BioSuit baseline design uses gas-filled gloves and boots, in addition to a gas-filled helmet. A later variant of the biosuit employs heat- activated shape-memory alloy (SMA) coils. In this design the suit fits loosely on the body when initially donned. When a power module is attached, the spring-like coils in the suit contract to form-fit the suit to the body. The design of the coil was further defined in an article in the journal IEEE/ASME: Transactions on Mechatronics. As of 2008, the Biosuit reportedly had the potential to be ready for use in Mars missions in the near future. As of 2019, an additional improvement has been made with the addition of nucleated boron tubes, which can shield the wearer of the suit from the radiation present in space and on the surfaces of the Moon and Mars. According to Cathy Lewis of the National Air and Space Museum, \\"It may not be the next suit, but it will be one of the subsequent suits,\\" indicating that development remains active and focused on future Moon and Mars missions.  In fiction  Writers including Dan Simmons, Stephen Baxter, Larry Niven, and Spider and Jeanne Robinson, have made use of space activity suits in their stories. The potential for greater mobility and simpler operation with a space activity suit make it an attractive choice for fiction, where flexibility of use can be a boon to plot development. The aesthetic qualities of a sleek, form-fitting space activity suit also contrast the traditional image of rigid, diving-suit- style spacesuits, lending a futuristic look to costumes. Most anime with futuristic themes include the skintight spacesuit (with the notable exception of Planetes and, to a lesser extent, the Gundam franchise). In the Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson, a suit similar to this is referred to as a \\"walker\\" and is intended purely for use in the Martian environment. In the fourth book of the Jumper series by Steven Gould, the development of a mechanical counterpressure suit is integral to the main plot.

It began fortnightly and was transmitted weekly from 1964. The presenter was Johnny Morris. The show combined jovial voiceovers applied to various animals from Bristol Zoo with some basic educational features. Morris' co-presenters over the years were Gerald Durrell, Tony Soper, Keith Shackleton, Roger Tabor, Sheila Young, David Taylor and Terry Nutkins. When Nutkins joined the show in the early 1980s, the producers tried to update it, using new video effects technology. This allowed them to do such things as \\"shrink\\" the presenters to allow them to see life from an ant's viewpoint, or to swim in a riverbed for example. Joe Henson and Desmond Morris also appeared on the show. Dotty the ring-tailed lemur appeared as a regular guest for eight years in the 1970s. Other animal stars included the sea lion Gemini, and two parrots, Cocky (a sulphur-crested cockatoo) and Brolly (an umbrella cockatoo). The show was discontinued in 1983 when the programme's anthropomorphic treatment of animals fell out of fashion. A new children's wildlife series, The Really Wild Show, began in 1986, with the former Animal Magic co-presenter Terry Nutkins as the main host. The 100th edition was transmitted on 4 January 1967. Many editions of the show were junked by the BBC in the early 1990s when they were assumed to be of no further use. Recent documentaries such as The Way We Went Wild have had to resort to using clips from off-air recordings of some shows.

Fed mainly by glaciers and snow melt, the river drains a rugged, sparsely populated region of more than ; over 70 percent of the basin is in Canada. From its highest headwaters to its confluence with the Columbia River, the Kootenay falls more than in elevation. Above its confluence with the Columbia, the Kootenay is comparable in terms of length, drainage area and volume, but has a steeper gradient and is characterized by larger falls and rapids. Part of the lower Kootenay forms Kootenay Lake, one of the biggest natural lakes in British Columbia. The Ktunaxa (Kootenai) were the first people to live along the Kootenay River. For hundreds of years, they hunted and fished on the river, quite isolated from neighboring indigenous groups. In the 19th century, a Canadian explorer, David Thompson, became the first recorded European to reach the Kootenay and established trading posts throughout the region. A gold rush on the Kootenay and later silver and galena strikes in its western basins in the late 19th century drew thousands of miners and settlers to the region, who soon were followed by the arrival of railroads and steamboats. The Doukhobors, a Russian religious sect, immigrated and established a short-lived colony, Brilliant, at the Kootenay's mouth; subsequently dispersing into many settlements, they contributed to the region's timber and agricultural industries. As with many Pacific Northwest rivers, many dams were built on the Kootenay in the 20th century to generate hydroelectricity, and protect against floods and droughts. Today, over of the river have been impounded behind five dams, and a sixth controls the level of Kootenay Lake. Name The river was described with slightly different names by two groups of the local Ktunaxa (Kootenai) Indian tribes. These indigenous people who lived along the upper river knew it as aqkinmiluk, simply meaning \\"river\\". The people along the lower river called it aqkoktlaqatl, a name whose meaning is not certain. The name \\"Flatbow River\\" comes from the name the Blackfeet used to call the Ktunaxa, for their \\"powerful, stylish bows\\",Jenish, p. 139 and was later recorded by French-Canadian fur traders. While searching for the ultimate source of the Columbia River, explorer David Thompson encountered Columbia Lake, where the Columbia River starts north as a small stream and the Kootenay rushes south, already a powerful river. Already knowing from earlier maps that the region included two rivers called the Columbia and the Kootenay, Thompson thought that what is now called the Columbia was the Kootenay, and he thought that he had not yet found the real Kootenay. Thence he applied the name \\"McGillivray‚Äôs River\\" to the real Kootenay in honor of his trading partners William and Duncan McGillivray.Jenish, p. 133 In his writings, the Columbia from Columbia Lake to the Big Bend was actually called the Kootenae.Burpee, p. lix The name \\"Kootenai\\" was also used by French Canadians to refer to the Ktunaxa in the 19th century. \\"Kootenai\\" is thought to be a word meaning \\"water people\\" in an Algonquian language.Landers et al, p. 28 The river is still referred to as Kootenai in the United States, while in Canada, where two-thirds of its length and 70 percent of its drainage basin lies, the river is spelled slightly different into Kootenay. Comparisons of various U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps from the 20th century show many misinterpretations or alternative names being applied to the segment of the river within the United States. These include \\"Kootanie\\", \\"Kootenie\\", and \\"Kootienay\\". The Geographic Names Information System of the USGS lists \\"Swan River\\" as an alternate name although the origin of this name is uncertain. (There is, however, a Swan River further southeast in Montana.) Course 1913 bird's-eye view map of the Kootenay and Columbia Rivers in the Rocky Mountain Trench. Columbia Lake is near the center and the Kootenay River flows from the upper right into the foreground. The Kootenay rises on the northeast side of the Beaverfoot Range of southeastern British Columbia, and flows initially southeast through a marshy valley in Kootenay National Park. The river becomes significantly larger at its confluence with the Vermilion River, which is actually the larger of the two where they meet near Kootenay Crossing. The Kootenay continues southeast, receiving the Palliser River from the left, and flows south into a gorge at the confluence with the White River. At the small town of Canal Flats the Kootenay River passes within of Columbia Lake, the headwaters of the Columbia River, as it merges into the Rocky Mountain Trench along the eastern foothills of the Selkirk Mountains. It receives the Lussier River near Skookumchuck Station of the Canadian Pacific Railway and the St. Mary and Wild Horse rivers at the historic mining town of Fort Steele, then receives the Bull River at the settlement of the same name. At Wardner, British Columbia, the Kootenay widens into the Lake Koocanusa reservoir, formed by Libby Dam over downstream at Jennings, Montana. The Elk River, the Kootenay's longest tributary, enters Lake Koocanusa south of Elko, British Columbia. Below Libby Dam the river, now known as the Kootenai, forms the \\"Big Bend\\" around the south side of the Purcell Mountains. It receives the Fisher River from the south and turns west, passing Libby, Montana. About below Libby it drops over Kootenai Falls. The river turns northwest at Troy, and the Yaak River and Moyie River (both originating in BC) join from the north, the latter near Moyie Springs, Idaho. In Idaho the river enters the gentle terrain of the Kootenai Valley, turning north at Bonners Ferry The Kootenai re-enters Canada and becomes the Kootenay again south of Creston, British Columbia, and flows through a marshy area called the Kootenay Flats. It then empties into -long Kootenay Lake, which is also joined by the Duncan River, the largest tributary in terms of volume. Near Balfour an arm of the lake branches westward to Nelson, where the Kootenay River exits the lake below Corra Linn Dam. The final westbound stretch of the river flows through a deep canyon, forming several waterfalls including Bonnington Falls. Four run-of-the river hydroelectric dams impound this part of the river. At Brilliant the Kootenay forms a small inland delta, then at Castlegar it joins with the Columbia River. Watershed At in size, the Kootenay river's watershed is one of the largest sub-basins of the Columbia Basin. Its drainage basin encompasses an area almost from north to south and from east to west, roughly defining a region of the Pacific Northwest known as the Kootenays.Kootenai Subbasin Plan Introduction, p. 11 In Canada, the term \\"Kootenays\\" is loosely defined although the Kootenay Land District, which includes the whole region, is formally defined; the name indirectly refers to the territory of the Kootenay indigenous people spanning from the Rockies on the east and the, Selkirks and Purcells (Percells in the U.S.) on the west in southeastern British Columbia (BC), and is used to mean more the area drained by the Kootenay River, namely including the lower Canadian stretches of the Columbia from Revelstoke to the US border, and also the reaches of the upper Columbia north from Canal Flats at least as far as Golden (the Boundary Country is sometimes referred to as being part of the West Kootenay). Over 70 percent of the Kootenay's watershed is in Canada while the Montana and Idaho portions occupy 23 and 6%, respectively. The Kootenay is one of the few major rivers in North America that begin in one country, cross into another, and return to the first‚Äîothers include the Milk River, a tributary of the Missouri River; the Souris River, a tributary of the Assiniboine River; and the Kettle River, a tributary of the Columbia River. It is the third largest tributary of the Columbia by drainage basin and discharge.Tributaries section of Wikipedia article on Columbia River Kootenay River valley in Kootenay National Park The Kootenay River is defined by rocky uplands and steep mountains, and there is relatively little flat land in the watershed. Most of the reasonably level terrain lies in the narrow Kootenay River valley from Bonners Ferry to Kootenay Lake and in parts of the Rocky Mountain Trench from Canal Flats to Lake Koocanusa. Mountain ranges in the region generally trend from northwest to southeast and define drainage patterns with their steep and dramatic vertical relief, with the exception of the Kootenay itself which cuts westwards at its southern bend. Of the Kootenay's many tributaries, the -long Duncan River is the largest. Hundreds of other tributaries join the river in its winding course, including the Vermilion, Cross, Palliser, White, Wild Horse, St. Mary, Elk, Fisher, Yaak, Moyie, Goat, and Slocan rivers.Kootenai Subbasin Plan Introduction, p. 12 Many river basins border on the Kootenay‚Äîsome are part of the Columbia Basin, while others drain to distant shores of the North American continent. On the south and southeast, the divide formed by the Cabinet and Whitefish ranges separate the Kootenay and Flathead River watersheds. The Flathead is a tributary of the Clark Fork River-Pend Oreille River system which borders the Kootenay watershed on the southwest. The upper Columbia River basin forms the boundary on the north, and the Kicking Horse River watershed also borders the north side of the Kootenay basin. To the southwest is the Priest River, a Pend Oreille tributary. On the east side, over the Continental Divide, the Bow River and Oldman River take rise. Both are tributaries of the South Saskatchewan River, which is part of the Hudson Bay drainage basin. Geology Relief map of the Kootenay River area The geologic story of the Kootenay is strongly connected to the geology of the Columbia, Selkirk and Rocky Mountains. The mountains in much of the Kootenay River catchment are composed of Precambrian sedimentary rock of the Belt Supergroup, in turn stratified into several subgroups with slightly different characteristics and ages. However, most of the rocks have one thing in common; the rocks are generally hard and erosion-resistant.Kootenai Subbasin Plan Introduction, p. 26 The Rocky Mountain Trench is thought to be a partial graben, or a long narrow strip of land that has dropped in elevation over time because of parallel faults on both sides.Kootenai Subbasin Plan Introduction, p. 27 Faults in the Kootenay River watershed trend north-northwest to south- southeast as is common in much of British Columbia. The underlying rock is generally stable and contains more outcroppings of metamorphic and igneous rock as one progresses westwards.Kootenai Subbasin Plan Introduction, p. 28 Formations of Cambrian and Devonian rock also appear in small amounts in the U.S. portion of the Kootenay. Bedrock composes much of the streambed in the upper and lower reaches of the Kootenay, but in the middle portion, alluvial sediments allow the river to meander over a broader valley floor. The sediments probably originated through heavy glaciation during the previous Ice Age. About 15,000 years ago, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet advanced southwards into present-day BC, Montana and Idaho, blocking the Kootenay River at the outlet of Kootenay Lake, which did not yet exist. Glaciers covered most of the northern Kootenay River watershed and heavily shaped the peaks and valleys one sees today. The glacier that formed Kootenay Lake caused the river to back up into an enormous body of water that stretched all the way to Libby, Montana, near where the Libby Dam now stands, and possibly even connected to Lake Pend Oreille, which also was much enlarged at the time. Glacially deposited sediments buried the old streambed of the Kootenay River and created a natural dam where the Kootenay turns west out of Kootenay Lake. After the glaciers retreated, Kootenay Lake receded to its present level and the Kootenay Flats were formed. History First inhabitants tepees, circa 1900 The First Peoples of the Kootenay River valley (the residents at the time of European contact) were the Ktunaxa people (often referred to as Kootenai) from whom the river's name derives. Ktunaxa creation myths state that their people were created by the Quilxka Nupika (supreme being) and have always lived in the region; one reads \\"I have created you Kootenai people to look after this beautiful land, to honor and guard and celebrate my Creation here.\\" However, linguistic and other evidence suggests that they are descended from Great Plains tribes that were driven out of their historic territory by the Blackfeet in the 16th century. The Ktunaxa are considered quite isolated from other Pacific Northwest and Great Plains tribes. Their language is an \\"isolate\\", which is only distantly related (if at all) to the Salishan languages spoken by tribes of the Lake Pend d'-Oreille area. They were semi- nomadic people and inhabited a large area of the Kootenay valley from the headwaters to Kootenay Lake. Four villages provided their shelter in the winter, while in the rest of the year, they traveled between fishing, hunting and berry-picking areas. The northern Ktunaxa hunted buffalo, while the southerners mainly fished. Notably, the Ktunaxa were the first tribe west of the Rockies to capture and use feral European-introduced horses for their own use.Miller, p. 10 The origin and meaning of the name \\"Kootenai\\" is uncertain. Prior to their discovery by Europeans, they were known as Ksanka, \\"people of the standing arrow\\". It is thought that French-Canadian fur trappers of the Hudson's Bay Company and other companies in the early 19th century were the first refer to them as Kootenai, which means \\"water people\\" in an Algonquian language. It may also mean \\"deer robes,\\" referring to their excellent skill for hunting deer. In some written records from the early 19th century, also by the French, the Ktunaxa were sometimes called the Flatbows (Arcs plats) and the river called the Flatbow River. Other inhabitants of the area included the Montana Salish (in the south) and Shuswap (in the north), but these tribes were mostly not on the main river. Exploration 1814 map of the Pacific Northwest and central Canada by David Thompson. The Kootenay River is shown near the bottom left as McGillivray's River. In 1806, explorer David Thompson set out from Saskatchewan to find the source of the Columbia. He crossed over the Canadian Rockies through Howse Pass and eventually arrived on the banks of the Kootenay, which he thought to be the Columbia. Thompson traveled down the river a ways but turned back when he was attacked by Native Americans.Holbrook, p. 40 The following year, Thompson, his family, and several men made another attempt at finding the Columbia. They crossed over the Rockies at a more northerly spot and traveled down the Blaeberry River to the Columbia, eventually discovering Columbia Lake and establishing there the trading post Kootenae House. In the spring of 1808, he set off down the Kootenay River, this time reaching present-day Montana and Idaho where he established Kullyspell House and Saleesh House, trading posts on Lake Pend Oreille and the Clark Fork, respectively.Holbrook, pp. 41-42 After spending a winter in Montana, he tried to reach the Columbia by traveling down the Pend Oreille River but failed in this attempt, eventually returning to Kootenae House via the Kootenay River northwards the following spring.Holbrook, p. 43 Falls of the Kootenay River below Kootenay Lake, ca. 1936 Through the early 19th century, Thompson continued to trade furs throughout the Kootenay region for the North West Company,Burpee, p. 48 and for the few years when he had a total monopoly over the Canadian fur trade west of the Rockies, he outlawed alcoholic drinks altogether. He was known to have written \\"I had made it a law to myself that no alcohol should pass the mountains in my company\\".Holbrook, p. 41-42 When two of Thompson's trading partners tried to make him take two barrels of rum to Kootanae House, Thompson \\"placed the two kegs on a vicious horse and by noon the kegs were empty and in pieces, the horse rubbing his load against the rocks to get rid of it ‚Ä¶ I told them what I had done, and that I would do the same to every keg of alcohol.\\"Holbrook, p. 42 Of course, wine, beer, rum and other intoxicating drinks were imported in time. John Palliser crossed the Rockies through a pass in 1858 that led to the headwaters of the Palliser River, a tributary of the Kootenay River now named in his honor. (However, at first, his party referred to it as Palliser's River.) His expedition made it downstream to Columbia Lake, but had some trouble making their way back to Alberta; the return route that they had chosen proved too dangerous to negotiate. After trading for some horses and new supplies from a band of Ktunaxa, they made it back over the Rockies later that year through North Kootenay Pass near Lower and Upper Kananaskis Lakes, after traveling up the Elk River.Forgotten highways, pp. 131-134 The series of expeditions he would later lead through 1859 were to be known as the Palliser Expeditions, or officially, the British North American Exploring Expedition, which although involved some travel west of the Rockies, was mostly limited to the east side of the Continental Divide. Palliser's earlier travels were credited for being a \\"vital forerunner to the European settlement of the Prairies [of central Canada], providing volumes of information on the resources of this vast region.\\" In September 1859, Palliser traveled into the Kootenay River valley to find a suitable path for a trade route and possibly a railroad. Instead of crossing the Rockies, as Thompson did, Palliser set out from Fort Colville, a Hudson's Bay Company trading post near Kettle Falls on the Columbia River.Palliser, p. 13 He then proceeded up the Pend Oreille River (noted as 'Pendoreilles') and crossed into the Kootenay River valley, which in his records was either the \\"Kootanie\\" or \\"Flat Bow River\\".Palliser, p. 14 Kootenay Lake was called \\"Flat Bow Lake\\". Palliser was told by Ktunaxa tribal members that a trail already existed along the Kootenay River, terminating at Columbia Lake, but was in decrepit condition (having been out of use for many years) and \\"entirely impracticable for horses\\".Palliser, p. 15 They re-blazed the trail for many miles and returned to Kootenay Lake by mid-October of the same year.Palliser, p. 16 The expedition's findings were later to become important transportation routes through the Rockies to the Kootenays area, and the trail that they followed later became the route of the Canadian Pacific Railway.Brink, p. 135 Gold and silver boom Fort Steele in 1910 In 1863, a gold strike at the confluence of the Wild Horse and Kootenay Rivers in the East Kootenay regionMiller, p. 12 resulted in the Wild Horse Gold Rush in which between three and ten thousand men descended upon the area and the gold rush town of Fisherville was built; it had to be moved when it was discovered the town sat atop some of the richest deposits. Originally, the river (and the area) were known as \\"Stud Horse\\" by the early miners, but government officials changed it to Wild Horse. The new town's site was officially named Kootenai (though still known as Fisherville), also spelled Kootenay and Koutenais and also known as Wild Horse. Galbraith's Ferry was established across the Kootenay near Fort Steele to facilitate crossing by the incoming rush of prospectors and merchants. Most of the gold was mined out by 1864, in June of which one American prospector wrote that some 200 miners were arriving each day. By 1865 the peak of the rush was over and the diggings had been found not as rich as previously believed when news arrived in 1865 of the strikes in the Big Bend of the Columbia and the bulk of the mining population moved there en masse. Fisherville, which had a Hudson's Bay post and other businesses, continued on with a few hundred residents for a few years (most of them Chinese by the end, as was the case with many other BC gold towns also) but was eclipsed as a supply centre with the creation of nearby Fort Steele. The Chinese miners continued to work the \\"played-out\\" claims abandoned by American and Canadian miners, taking what little gold was left. Fisherville eventually was abandoned, its buildings left to ruin, and little remains of the settlement today. Other gold rushes on the Moyie and Goat Rivers, tributaries of the Kootenay, were followed by the discovery of silver and galena mines in the Kootenay Lake and Slocan Valley areas (Silvery Slocan), leading rapidly to the settlement of the region and the creation of various \\"silver city\\" boomtowns, notably Nelson, at the outlet of Kootenay Lake, Kaslo, midway up its north arm, New Denver, Silverton, Slocan City and Sandon in the 1880s and 1890s. By 1889, a smelter had been constructed close to the mouth of the Kootenay, near Revelstoke, to process ore from the mines.'Basque, p. 68 Serving the mines and settlers, steamer companies plied the Kootenai River from Bonners Ferry, Idaho to Nelson and to the Lardeau or \\"Lardo\\" district at the north end of Kootenay Lake, and also on the upper Kootenay River between the Cranbrook-Fort Steele area and points in Montana. Steamboats J.D. Farrell and North Star on the Kootenay at Jennings, Montana When the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) finished its transcontinental line across southern British Columbia, steamboats began to ply the upper Columbia and Kootenay Rivers, carrying passengers, produce, ore, and other trade items through the region to be distributed via the CPR's line at Golden. The total run was about long, ranging from Golden to the north to Jennings, Montana in the south, with a portage at Canal Flats. The Kootenay's steamboat era was short and lasted for only about 28 years.Holbrook, p. 164 In 1882, as part of an incentive to help navigation on the Golden-Jennings run and possibly divert water northwards to the Interior of British Columbia in order to provide flood control for a low-lying area south of Kootenay Lake, called Kootenay Flats, European adventurer William Adolf Baillie-Grohman proposed the creation of a canal between the Kootenay River and Columbia Lake.Basque, p. 80 Construction of the -long, -broad channel was finished in 1889. The Baillie-Grohman Canal, as it was called, had one lock which was long and wide.Holbrook, p. 166Basque, pp. 75-77 Because of the rugged terrain and rough waters on the two rivers, especially on the glacier-fed Kootenay, steamboat operation was extremely difficult and proved to be anything but cost effective. The roughest water was in Jennings Canyon, now mostly submerged in the Lake Koocanusa reservoir behind Libby Dam. Two of the first steamers, the Duchess and the Cline, both sank when transporting miners to the Wild Horse gold rush on the Kootenay. Both ships had not even reached Canal Flats when they hit rocks in the Columbia.Holbrook, p. 167 The first steamboat to actually run the Kootenay was the Annerly in 1893. Later vessels, such as the Gwendoline, had mixed success. Captain Frank P. Armstrong, who had piloted several earlier steamboats on the Golden-Jennings run, was her builder and when she was about three-quarters completed, Armstrong decided to take her to Golden to complete the job. Gwendoline sailed up to the canal, which unfortunately was unusable because the gates of the lock had been dynamited due to a Kootenay flood. Armstrong was forced to portage the vessel and eventually made it to Golden. Gwendoline eventually sailed back south to Jennings to haul iron ore on the Kootenay.Holbrook, p. 169 She was also the only ship to ever travel through the canal by proper means, and made two of the only three steamboat trips through the canal. The last ship ever to pass through the canal and one of the last on the Kootenay was the North Star, also piloted by Captain Armstrong. In 1902, Armstrong decided to take North Star to sail on the Columbia instead, finding business on the Kootenay less and less profitable as the mines in the region played out, as the CPR established its Kootenay Central Railway branch, and for a variety of other reasons.Holbrook, pp. 170-171 In June of that year, Armstrong took North Star to the Baillie-Grohman Canal, which was in decrepit condition. The lock was also too small to accommodate the vessel. Armstrong had two makeshift dams built to create a temporary lock long, and then the forward dam was blown up so the ship could ride the surge of water ahead into Columbia Lake.Holbrook, pp. 171-172 The transit of North Star to Columbia Lake was the last time the canal was ever used by a steamboat and marked the end of the steamboat era on the Kootenay. Doukhobor settlement In the 20th century, members of a Russian religious sect called the Doukhobors living in the plains of Saskatchewan in central Canada were facing persecution, internal problems and land confiscation by the Canadian government. Their leader, Peter Verigin, decided to move them to British Columbia in 1909, seeking land and an improved life.Holbrook, pp. 196-198 He chose a townsite on the north bank of the Kootenay, where it joins the Columbia, across the big river from where the present-day town of Castlegar now stands.Holbrook, p. 199 In 1909, he purchased about adjoining the mouth of the Kootenay River partly using funds raised by sale of farm equipment in Saskatchewan, and added to other lands acquired throughout BC, Doukhobor-owned lands ultimately totaled . There was already a small settlement on the site, called Waterloo, but Verigin renamed it Brilliant, for the \\"sparkling waters\\" of the river. The whole area was known by the name, Dolina Ooteschenie, meaning \\"valley of consolation\\". By 1913, there were already more than 5,000 Doukhobors living in the region. Peter Verigin (left) and group of followers in Glade, British Columbia, circa 1907 When they first arrived in British Columbia, the Doukhobors began felling trees in the Kootenay River valley to build their first homesteads. They also cleared areas of level ground in order to plant orchards and fields, and constructed sawmills on the Columbia and Kootenay rivers to process the logs into lumber. After more settlers began arriving, they built larger buildings that housed multiple families, instead of the small cabins then typical of the region. Each larger house or dom, holding 70-100 persons each, was constructed on roughly plots of land that Verigin had divided the entire community into back in 1911. The Doukhobors then constructed a brick factory at the present- day site of Grand Forks, from where they made bricks to be used mostly in the Brilliant settlement. Brilliant was one of the first cities in the area to have running water; a reservoir was constructed to hold water from the Kootenay River and a local spring,Holbrook, p. 200 and by 1912, each household had running water. In 1913, Verigin converted an abandoned factory in Nelson, about up the Kootenay from Brilliant, to produce jam and marmalade. The Doukhobors then established a ferry across the Columbia River, and a suspension bridge serving the same purpose was completed in 1913. For many years, Brilliant continued to be a major center in the region's lumber industry. Verigin Memorial However, Doukhobor views on education and the extremist actions of a Doukhobor group called the Sons of Freedom eventually spelled the end of their settlement. In the 1920s, unknown arsonists destroyed several public schools in Brilliant as an act against British Columbia law.Holbrook, p. 202 Then in 1924, on a routine rail trip to Grand Forks, Peter Verigin and seven other people were killed by a dynamite explosion that completely destroyed the coach that he was traveling in. Pieces of battery and alarm clock indicated that this was the work of people who intentionally wanted to kill Verigin,Holbrook, pp. 204-205 most likely members of the Sons of Freedom, or as some historians put it, by the lover of one of Verigin's handmaidens. Over 7,000 people attended Verigin's funeral. The Doukhobor leader was buried in an elaborate tomb on a headland overlooking the city of Brilliant and the Kootenay and Columbia Rivers. Verigin was succeeded by his son, Peter P. Verigin, who arrived from Russia in 1927. Despite the economic reforms he created in response to debt to the federal government, his arrival coincided with a terrible depression and bankruptcy which caused the Doukhobors to lose most of their lands. Verigin Jr. died in 1939 and by 1963, almost all Doukhobor lands were sold to the government. Today, little remains of the former settlement at Brilliant except for Verigin's tomb.Holbrook, pp. 206-207 The Doukhobor suspension bridge spanning the Kootenay River still stands, and was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1995. Ecology The south (Kootenay) arm of Kootenay Lake The Northwest Power and Conservation Council divides the Kootenay River watershed into six biomes: aquatic (rivers and lakes), riparian zones, wetlands, grassland/shrubs, moderately wet forest, and dry forest.Characterization of Biomes, p. 83 The forested zones extend through the alpine and subalpine reaches of the watershed, while grasslands dominate the low terraces and plateaus surrounding the river, especially in the Lake Koocanusa area and the Montana-Idaho portion of the watershed.Characterization of Biomes, p. 85 In the Canada portion of the watershed, an alpine meadow ecozone occupies most of the high ridges and valleys of the mountains.Characterization of Biomes, p. 87 In the Canadian portion of the Columbia Basin, almost half of which is part of the Kootenay River basin,The Canadian portion of the Columbia basin encompasses of which drain to the Kootenay RiverThe usage of the term \\"Canadian portion of the Columbia Basin\\" in this article denotes any parts of the Columbia River watershed that drain to the Columbia upstream of where it crosses the Canada- US border, regardless if the tributary passes through the United States as well (such as the Kootenay). Under this usage, for example, the Kootenay, which originates in Canada, flows back to the US, and returns to Canada, is considered part of the \\"Canadian portion\\", whereas the Okanogan River, which begins in Canada but joins the Columbia in the US, is not part of the \\"Canadian portion\\". The Clark Fork-Pend Oreille system, whose watershed is almost entirely within the United States, is considered part of the \\"Canadian portion\\" because the Pend Oreille meets the Columbia just north of the border. there are 447 species of terrestrial vertebrates. Most of the Kootenay basin lies within the Columbia Glaciated ecoregion which encompasses much of northeastern Washington, northern Idaho, northwestern Montana and southern British Columbia. Fish fauna in the region are largely shared with those of the Columbia Unglaciated ecoregion to the south, which has about fifty species of fish and only one endemic species. There are no endemic fish within the Columbia Glaciated region itself. Riparian vegetation is mostly found along the lower two-thirds of the Kootenay and many of the tributaries that join within the United States. The other sections of the river flow through far more rugged terrain and are characterized by braiding, low nutrient content, shifting channels and coarse sediments, making it difficult for riparian zones to be established, as is with most of its upper and lower tributaries.Characterization of Biomes, p. 89-92 Wetlands are found primarily where the river broadens into a series of sloughs, side-channels, marshes and small lakes before entering Kootenay Lake. This biologically diverse area, the Kootenay Flats, once supported over 1 million migratory birds every year, before the river was diked and many of the wetlands converted to agriculture. Naturally, the Kootenay has a high sediment content because of high erosion of glacial sediments in the mountains. Because of the steep rapids and falls between Kootenay Lake and the river's mouth, the Kootenay (with the exception of its tributary, the Slocan River) has never been a significant stream for the annual runs of Columbia River salmon. However, landlocked salmon inhabit the upper reaches of the river above and in Kootenay Lake.The Columbia, p. 8 This is attributed to a Kootenay River flood a long time ago, before the construction of any dams on the Columbia (Columbia River dams now block salmon from reaching any of the salmon run streams above Chief Joseph Dam ) which overflowed into Columbia Lake. It was with the creation of this temporary body of water that salmon somehow managed to swim over the submerged Canal Flats and into the Kootenay, where they became trapped. Populations of large land mammals such as caribou, moose, deer, elk, have been declining dramatically since the reintroduction of wolves. Species almost entirely gone that were once common in the area include the white-tailed jackrabbit, pygmy short- horned lizard, band-tailed pigeon and passenger pigeon. After exploitation of the Kootenay basin by fur trappers, the beaver population was nearly exterminated as well.Fish and Wildlife Communities, p. 181-182 Economy 1887 illustration of logging at Canal Flats, British Columbia. Even before non-aboriginal people came to the region, the Kootenay River valley was an important path of trade and transport between the tribes of the Canadian Rockies and the Idaho Panhandle, mostly between the Ktunaxa (who practiced agriculture and aquaculture) and the Salish, Blackfeet and Pend d'Oreilles of the south and east, and with the Shuswap in the north. The physiographic continuation of the Kootenai Valley southwards from present-day Bonners Ferry, Idaho into the Pend Oreille basin via the Purcell Trench formed a natural corridor through which natives of the area could interact. The barrier formed by the Rocky Mountains to the east, however, meant that tribes of the area, especially the Ktunaxa, were economically and linguistically isolated from the Great Plains tribes (with the exception of the Shoshone, whose territory spanned both sides of the Rockies). Logging began in the 19th century as a result of white emigration to the Kootenay region, and remains one of the primary industries of the area. In fact, much of the economy of the Pacific Northwest and Columbia Basin has historically been, and continues to be, to this day, dependent on the lumber industry. Lumber was required for the construction of buildings, forts, railroad tracks, and boats, and today is exported from the region in great amounts providing jobs and income for inhabitants of the area. Even in relatively uninhabited regions of the watershed, logging roads criss-cross the hills and mountainsides. Over 90 percent of the Kootenay basin is forested, but only about 10 percent of the area is not affected by some kind of lumber-industry development, now defined as about twenty \\"roadless areas\\" or \\"blocks\\", with 18 in the US. To a limited extent, the Kootenay River has also been used for navigation. Commercial navigation began with steamboats in the 19th century to transport ores, lumber, passengers and other imported and exported products between the Kootenay River valley and the Canadian Pacific Railway station at Golden, British Columbia. Boat travel on the upper river ceased when a rail line was built along the Kootenay upstream of the big bend. Steamboats also operated briefly on the lower river and Kootenay Lake to service silver mines in the nearby mountains. In modern times, boats continue to ply Kootenay Lake and limited reaches of the Kootenay River. Mining is also an important economic support of the Kootenay River area. Although originally valuable minerals such as gold and silver were unearthed, today coal is the primary resource extracted from underground. Conventional coal deposits underlie much of the East Kootenay, especially in the Elk River valley which is home to the Elk Valley Coalfield, and the Crowsnest Coalfield in the Purcell Mountains. The East Kootenay is the most important coal-producing area of British Columbia, has since 1898 produced over 500 million tons, and about 25 percent of the world's steel-making coal comes from the region. Most of the coal from the East Kootenay coalfields is exported to Japan and Korea. Ottertail River, a headwater of the Kootenay River in Kootenay National Park Lead, zinc, copper and silver are still mined at some places in the Kootenay River basin, notably at the giant Sullivan Mine near Kimberley, British Columbia, which is the largest in the Kootenay watershed. Agriculture, however, is a much less important industry, and many of the fertile riverside lands have been flooded by the construction of dams (most notably Libby Dam in Montana, which backs water into Canada). Only about two percent of the entire Kootenay basin ( is used for agriculture, and much of that is for pasture and foraging). Crops such as oats, barley and wheat account for 62 percent of the agricultural output of the region, much of which is used locally or exported by rail. The primary agricultural region is the Kootenai Valley of northern Idaho just south of Kootenay Lake. The West Kootenay, however, is transitioning from a coal-mining to a tourism-based economy, and the rest of the Kootenay region is also starting to do so. The economy of southeastern British Columbia is becoming increasingly reliant on tourism, and several Canadian national and state parks have already been established, and several national forests in the U.S. River modifications Map highlighting major dams and reservoirs in the Kootenay River watershed and surrounds Dams, power plants and diversions of the Kootenay River, of which there are many, have been built for a variety of reasons throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The seven dams on the Kootenay serve many purposes, ranging from generation of local electricity to regulation of Columbia River flow between Canada and the United States. None provide for navigation or fish passage. In former times, the Kootenay would rise each spring and early summers with \\"enormous freshets that every summer flood the Kootenay River valley\\",Burpee, p. xlvi but because of water regulation nowadays, such extreme variation in flow are no longer common on the lower river below Libby Dam. The Falls As early as 1898, without building a dam, the original Lower Bonnington Power Plant was generating hydroelectricity from Bonnington Falls in the Kootenay River near the confluence of the Slocan River in order to supply water to mines in Rossland, British Columbia. For Upper Bonnington, the first dam built on the river, the original goal was to improve navigation between Kootenay Lake and the Kootenay's mouth on the Columbia by drowning the dangerous Bonnigton Falls rapids that also blocked fish migration, and hopefully introducing fish to the upper river by constructing a fish ladder. None of these amenities for steamboats or salmon were ever constructed‚Äîin fact, the dam ended up being built above the falls instead of below them‚Äîand Upper Bonnington Dam, when completed in 1906, only generated hydroelectric power, and has served that purpose ever since. Commercial demand led to two more dams at the falls, these were South Slocan Dam in 1928, and Corra Linn Dam, at the rapids above Bonnington in 1932. Three of the dams are of the run-of-the-river type, the 4.5 km length of the falls is now impounded in small lakes. All except Corra Linn, which was built to raise and regulate the level of Kootenay Lake. The Kootenay Canal Generating Station, completed in 1976 by BC Hydro, has its inlet at Kootenay Lake next to Corra Linn. The canal travels several kilometers, parallel to and above the river to utilize the roughly high water drop in elevation between Kootenay Lake and South Slocan, bypassing the old dams. The canal is used to generate hydroelectricity, as are the four dams. The Lower River After the falls and the junction with the Slocan River the last of the river is a gradual slope to the merger with the Columbia. In 1944 the last privately owned development Brilliant Dam was built, just before the Kootenay river flows into the Columbia River at Castlegar. Columbia River Treaty Duncan Dam on the Duncan River regulates water flow into Kootenay Lake as part of the Columbia River Treaty Stanley Peak in Kootenay National Park Kootenay Lake The Columbia Basin is noted for its spring floods, major flood years were 1876, 1894, 1948 and 1964. As recently as the mid-1960s, the upper Columbia and Kootenay rivers in British Columbia were still free-flowing and unaffected by dams and reservoirs, resulting in the 1948 Vanport Oregon flood. The uncontrolled discharge past the Canada-U.S. border created problems for electricity generation in the US, and Canada also wanted to utilize the Columbia river for the production of hydroelectric power. Negotiated in 1961 between the governments of the two countries, the Columbia River Treaty attempted to ratify these problems. Construction of the first three of the four dams authorized by the treaty‚ÄîMica, Keenleyside and Duncan‚Äîwas implemented in 1964. Of the four dams, the first two are on the Columbia, the third is on the Duncan River, a tributary of the Kootenay, and the fourth Libby, on the Kootenay River proper. However, operation of the dams has led to environmental problems in both rivers because they have caused unnatural flow fluctuations, blocked fish migration, flooded fertile agricultural land, and forced over 2,000 people to relocate. Solely built for the purpose of regulating water flow into Kootenay Lake, Duncan Dam, the first dam built for the treaty, was raised in 1967 and increased the long size of Duncan Lake to a reservoir long. Because of its purpose, it has no power generation facilities. Libby Dam, the fourth and last dam built under the treaty, was completed in 1975 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It is the first of the dams that the Kootenay encounters durings its journey and provides further regulation of the water that flows into Kootenay Lake. The other two dams built for the treaty, Keenleyside and Mica, are both on the Columbia River. Kootenay basin reservoirs provide nearly of storage which constitutes almost half of the stored in Columbia River Treaty reservoirs. Diversion proposal In the 1970s, it was proposed that the Kootenay River be diverted into the Columbia River (the two rivers are separated by a distance of no more than near Canal Flats in the Rocky Mountain Trench in southeastern British Columbia). This would allow for the generation of increased hydroelectric power on the Columbia. It would also make easier the reclamation of the Kootenay Flats, an area south of Kootenay Lake, for agricultural purposes‚Äîspring freshets once raised the level of the lake by up to , inundating the lowlands around it.Basque, p. 81 There were also never- implemented plans to divert part of the Kootenay enlarged Columbia River through a tunnel to the headwaters of the Thompson River in the northwest, and thence to the Fraser River valley of southwestern British Columbia.The Columbia, p. 325 The proposal was strongly opposed by both environmentalists as well as local residents. The economy of southeastern British Columbia is strongly dependent on tourism, with the Columbia River, including Columbia Lake and Windermere Lake, being very popular for summer swimming and boating activities. Diversion of the glacier-fed Kootenay River would have resulted in the Columbia River becoming much deeper and colder, flooding riverside communities and damaging tourism. At the opposite end of the scale, it would dry the bed of the Kootenay River downstream of Canal Flats, cutting off water supply to residents of the upper Kootenay Valley and invalidating the effectiveness of Libby Dam, whose construction was to begin in a few years. As a result, this proposed river diversion was never undertaken.The Columbia, p. 326 Recreation Many national, provincial and state parks, wilderness preserves, protected areas and national forests lie partially or wholly within the Kootenay River watershed. In Canada, these include those listed below as well as many others. *Bugaboo Provincial Park *Creston Valley Wildlife Management Area *Gilnockie Provincial Park *Goat Range Provincial Park *Kianuko Provincial Park *Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park *Kootenay National Park *Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park *Purcell Wilderness Conservancy Provincial Park and Protected Area *St. Mary's Alpine Provincial Park *Top of the World Provincial Park *Valhalla Provincial Park *West Arm Provincial Park Popular Banff National Park lies just across the BC-Alberta border, Yoho National Park sits to the north, and Glacier National Park in the northeast. The U.S. portion of the watershed includes Kootenai National Forest and Kaniksu National Forest (part of the Idaho Panhandle National Forests, which stretch southwards into the state). In Kootenay National Park alone, there are over of hiking trails, ranging from short day hikes to long backpacking trips. Cross-country skiing and snowshoeing are popular on the park's trails in the winter. Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park, which sits right next to Kootenay in the Rocky Mountains, also has an extensive trail system affording extensive views of the surrounding ranges. Kikomun Creek Provincial Park, on the northeast shore of Lake Koocanusa, includes campgrounds and access to boat launches on the east shore of the lake. The Kootenai River Trail along the Montana section of the river, about long, follows the river from Libby to Kootenai Falls and the well known Swinging Bridge across the Kootenai. Skattebo Reach Trail, on the lower river, is about long, running from Brilliant to Glade. Further downstream, five separate sites around Kootenay Lake form the Kootenay Lake Provincial Park. West Arm Provincial Park is on the impounded stretch of the Kootenay River just west of Kootenay Lake, and to the northeast of Nelson. Smaller Kokanee Creek Provincial Park, one of the more popular recreation areas in the West Kootenay, sits across the river from West Arm. Fishing is generally good on the middle reaches of the Kootenay River and in Kootenay Lake. Westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, kokanee salmon (the landlocked Pacific salmon), rainbow trout and white sturgeon are among the many species found in the river. Kokanee and rainbows are commonly found in Lake Koocanusa. Kootenai Falls, which drops some within a run of a few hundred meters, forms a natural boundary between fishes of the upper and lower river, but Libby Dam, several kilometres upstream, is an even more formidable barrier. Fish in the Kootenay have traditionally been abundant but the construction of the dam may have led to declines in the population of sturgeon, among other fishes, because of changes in water flow. The best season for fishing is from June to November. One may fish from banks, sandbars and islands, or from boats. Because of the size and strength of the river, fishing from drift boats is easier than from the shore. Also, because the Kootenay's primary sources are glaciers, fishing conditions are quite different from most rivers in Montana and Idaho, which are fed by snowmelt. In the United States, the Kootenay, with its \\"exceptional\\" trout fishing, is considered a Blue Ribbon fishery. Boathouses on Kootenay Lake near Balfour, British Columbia Steep and strewn with rapids, the Kootenay, despite being unsuitable for commercial transportation of agricultural and mineral products, is considered an outstanding whitewater river. Whitewater rafting is popular on the Kootenay in two stretches: in Jennings Canyon between the Libby Dam in Montana and Bonners Ferry in Idaho, and in the upper reaches of the river in Kootenay National Park in British Columbia. Rafting the middle Kootenay between Libby Dam and Bonners Ferry is best at flows of . The run, about from east to west, includes Class IV+ rapids and includes Kootenai Falls, which rarely has been run safely, in the middle of its course. In Montana, the river is rated a Class I water under the Montana Stream Access Law for recreational purposes from Libby Dam to the Montana-Idaho border. Class I represents bodies of water that are navigable and suitable for recreation. Rafting is also popular in some of the Canadian stretches of the river, especially those near the headwaters that have the steepest gradient and the most challenging rapids. Several Canadian outfitters provide trips on the river near Kootenay National Park ranging from a few hours to several days. Canoeing in the numerous sloughs, side-channels and distributaries of the Kootenay that thread through the wetlands of the Kootenay Flats has the additional benefit of watching birds and wildlife in the Creston Valley Wildlife Management Unit and other surrounding marshes.Landers et al, p. 317 Larger craft such as houseboats are able to travel on Kootenay and Koocanusa Lakes. Rafting and kayaking is also an activity on the swift-flowing Slocan River, the lowermost major tributary of the Kootenay, and in parts of other major Kootenay tributaries as well.Landers et al, p. 306 See also *List of Crossings of the Kootenay River *List of longest rivers of Canada *List of rivers of British Columbia *List of rivers of Idaho *List of longest streams of Idaho *List of rivers of Montana *List of tributaries of the Columbia River *List of dams in the Columbia River watershed *Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation *Dewdney Trail *Montana Stream Access Law References Works cited    Further reading * Bathymetric Surveys of the Kootenai River near Bonners Ferry, Idaho United States Geological Survey * Rivers of Boundary County, Idaho Rivers of Lincoln County, Montana Regional District of Central Kootenay Regional District of East Kootenay Rivers of the Canadian Rockies Rivers of Idaho Rivers of Montana Tributaries of the Columbia River Kootenays Rivers of British Columbia International rivers of North America ","title":"Kootenay River"},{"id":"704657","text":"The Okanogan River (known as the Okanagan River in Canada) is a tributary of the Columbia River, approximately 115 mi (185 km) long, in southern British Columbia and north central Washington. It drains a scenic plateau region called the Okanagan Country east of the Cascade Range and north and west of the Columbia, and also the Okanagan region of British Columbia. The Canadian portion of the river has been channelized since the mid-1950s. Course The Okanagan River rises in southern British Columbia, issuing out of the southern end of Okanagan Lake, which is on the north side of the city of Penticton. It flows south past Penticton, through Skaha Lake, past Okanagan Falls, through Vaseux Lake, and past Oliver to Osoyoos and Osoyoos Lake, which spans the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border and has its outlet into the Okanogan River at Oroville, on the southern shore of the lake, in Okanogan County. At the border the river's name (and the region and also the name of the Okanagan Highland) changes spelling from Okanagan to Okanogan. Average annual flow of the river at this point is 643 cfs (18.2 m¬≥/s). From Oroville the Okanogan River flows south through the Okanogan County, past Okanogan and Omak. It forms the western boundary of the Colville Indian Reservation. The Okanogan River enters the Columbia River from the north, 5 miles (8 km) east of Brewster, between the Wells Dam (downstream) and the Chief Joseph Dam (upstream). The reservoir behind Wells Dam, into which the Okanogan empties, is called Lake Pateros. Tributaries The river at Omak, Washington The Okanogan River receives the Similkameen River from the west near Oroville. It receives Omak Creek from the east near Omak, Tonasket Creek from the east near Oroville and Bonaparte Creek at Tonasket which flows from Bonaparte Lake near Wauconda and also from Aeneas Valley west of the Sanpoil. It occasionally receives water from Salmon Creek at the town of Okanogan but much of the year this water is diverted for irrigation. History The river takes its name from the Okanagan (or Syilx) placename [ukwnaq√≠n]. The name Okanagan was subsequently applied to the Syilx people themselves. Early maps of the fur trade era show the Okanagan River as the \\"Caledonia River\\", a name conferred as it was the connecting route between the Columbia District and the New Caledonia Fur District (which began north of Okanagan Lake). Fort Okanogan, a fur-trading post opened by the Pacific Fur Company (PFC) late in 1811, was located at the river's confluence with the Columbia. The isolation and pressures caused by the War of 1812 forced the PFC to sell its property and assets to its Canadian rivals, the North West Company. The NWC was in turn merged into the Hudson's Bay Company in 1821, the latter company maintaining a presence at Fort Okanogan until the 1850s. During the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858-1859, parties of armed miners, often at conflict with native peoples in the region, traveled the Okanagan Trail and its western branch, the Similkameen Trail, via the river. After hostilities subsided, the route continued to be important as the southern leg of the overland trail to the Cariboo Gold Rush known then by its fur trade era name as the Brigade Trail.

The AIAA is the U.S. representative on the International Astronautical Federation and the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences. In 2015, it had more than 30,000 members among aerospace professionals worldwide (a majority are American and/or live in the United States).  History  The AIAA was founded in 1963 from the merger of two earlier societies: the American Rocket Society (ARS), founded in 1930 as the American Interplanetary Society (AIS), and the Institute of the Aerospace Sciences (IAS), founded in 1932 as the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences. Paul Johnston was the first executive director of the organization. Jim Harford took his seat after 18 months. The newly-formed structure gathered 47 technical committees and one broad technical publication, the AIAA Journal. The AIAA Student Journal was also launched in 1963. The merger also led to the sale of the organizations' former headquarter buildings, and the relocation in the Sperry Rand Building. In 1967, the Technical Committee on Space and Atmospheric Science launched a study to capture the opinion of its members in California on the UFO phenomenon. In April 2017, John Langford, CEO of Aurora Flight Sciences, was elected President of the AIAA.  Activities   Journals  As a major activity, AIAA currently publishes several technical journals. The AIAA Journal is published on a monthly basis and serves as the flagship journal of the society. In January 2015 the Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics became the second AIAA journal published on a monthly basis. The other journals are published bi-monthly and have more specialized topics: * Journal of Air Transportation (Starting in 2016) * Journal of Aerospace Information Systems (formerly Journal of Aerospace Computing, Information, and Communication) * Journal of Aircraft * Journal of Energy (published from 1977 to 1983) * Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics * Journal of Hydronautics (published from 1967 to 1980) * Journal of Propulsion and Power * Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets * Journal of Thermophysics and Heat Transfer AIAA's flagship magazine Aerospace America is distributed monthly to all members, and is published online in digital format. AIAA also produces several series of technical books ranging from education to progress in advanced research topics.

His mother was Francis Madalein Foy (died 1983). He was half-brother to champion amateur jockey William Shand Kydd (1937‚Äì2014), who was the husband of Christina Muriel Duncan, sister of Veronica Bingham, Countess of Lucan. Marriages He married Janet Munro Kerr, granddaughter of John Martin Munro Kerr. He sold the family business in 1962 and moved his family to Australia, where he became a sheep farmer. After selling the farm and returning to England, and still married, he began an affair with Diana's mother Viscountess Althorp. She was married to John Spencer, Viscount Althorp, later 8th Earl Spencer. They both divorced, and then were free to marry each other, which they did on 2 May 1969. He thus became stepfather to her four children, including Diana, although the Viscount eventually won the bitter custody battle.

As an undergraduate, Maclean openly proclaimed his left-wing views, and was recruited into the Soviet intelligence service, then known as the NKVD. However, he gained entry to the Civil Service by claiming to have foresworn Marxism. In 1938, he was made Third Secretary at the Paris embassy, where he kept the Soviets informed about Anglo-German diplomacy. He then served in Washington, D.C. from 1944 to 1948, achieving promotion to First Secretary. Here he became Moscow's main source of information about US thermonuclear policy, greatly helping the Soviets to evaluate the relative strength of their own nuclear arsenal. By the time he was appointed head of the American Department in the Foreign Office, Maclean was widely suspected of being a spy. The Soviets ordered Maclean to defect in 1951. In much later declassified reports, British Intelligence denied to the heads of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) any knowledge of Maclean's activities or whereabouts. In Moscow, Maclean worked as a specialist on British policy and relations between the Soviet Union and NATO. He was reported to have died there on 6 March 1983.

Maclean, mmn = Devitt Donald Duart Maclean was the son of Sir Donald Maclean and Gwendolen Margaret Devitt. His father was chosen as chairman of the rump of the 23 independent MPs who backed H. H. Asquith in the Liberal Party in the House of Commons whilst the bulk of the Liberal MPs had followed David Lloyd George into the Coalition Liberal party in the November 1918 election. As the Labour Party had no leader and Sinn F√©in did not attend, he became titular Leader of the Opposition. Maclean's parents had houses in London (later in Buckinghamshire) as well as in the Scottish Borders, where his father represented Peebles and Southern Midlothian, but the family lived mostly in and around London. He grew up in a very political household, in which world affairs were constantly discussed. In 1931 his father entered the Coalition Cabinet as President of the Board of Education. Maclean's education began as a boarder at St Ronan's School, Worthing. At the age of 13, he was sent to Gresham's School in Norfolk,S.G.G. Benson and Martin Crossley Evans, I Will Plant Me a Tree: an Illustrated History of Gresham's School, London: James & James, 2002. where he remained from 1926 until 1931, when he was 18. At Gresham's, some of his contemporaries were Jack Simon (later Baron Simon, a Law Lord), James Klugmann (1912‚Äì1977), Roger Simon (1913‚Äì2002), Benjamin Britten (1913‚Äì1976) and the scientist and Nobel laureate Sir Alan Lloyd Hodgkin. At Gresham's, all students were required to sign an oath swearing to report on themselves and their fellow students of any and all impure thoughts and actions. Historian Roland Philipps explained to Lapham's Quarterly that Gresham's School is where Donald Maclean as a teenager learned to perfect the traitor's art of duplicity. Gresham's was then looked on as both liberal and progressive. It had already produced Tom Wintringham (1898‚Äì1949) a Marxist military historian, journalist, and author. James Klugmann and Roger Simon both went with Maclean to Cambridge and joined the Communist Party at around the same time. Klugmann became the official historian of the British Communist Party, while Simon was later a left-wing Labour peer. When Maclean was 16, his father was elected for the North Cornwall constituency, and he spent some time in Cornwall during vacations. Cambridge From Gresham's, Maclean won a place at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, arriving in 1931 to read modern languages. Even before the end of his first year he began to throw off parental restraints and engage openly in communist agitprop.Cecil, Robert, A Divided Life: A Personal Portrait of the Spy Donald Maclean, New York: William Morrow and Company, 1989, pp. 22‚Äì23. He also played rugby for his college through the winter of 1932‚Äì33.Cecil, A Divided Life (1989), p. 28. Eventually his ambitions would lead to him joining the Communist Party. In Maclean's second year at Cambridge his father died. Maclean's political views grew much more apparent in the following years in light of \\"his admiring, if sometimes puzzled, mother\\".Cecil, A Divided Life (1989), p. 23. In his final years Maclean had become a campus figure with most knowing he was a communist. In the winter of 1933‚Äì34, he wrote a book review for Cambridge Left, to which other leading communists contributed, such as John Cornford, Charles Madge and the Irish scientist, J. D. Bernal. Donald reviewed Contemporary Literature and Social Revolution by J. D. Charques, praising the book in slightly patronising terms for its readiness \\"to hint at a Marxist conception of literature\\". In 1934, he became the editor of the Silver Crescent, the Trinity Hall students' magazine. His editorials stressed the decline in world trade, rearmament and arms trafficking. In one article, he insisted: \\"England is in the throes of a capitalist crisis....If the analysis in the Editorial: A Personal is correct, there is an excellent reason why everyone of military age should start thinking about politics.\\"Cecil, A Divided Life (1989), pp. 27‚Äì30. His Marxist views pervaded all aspects of his public life, often citing the flaws in the university administration. In a letter to Granta he ascribed the demand for a democratically elected student council, equality for female students and rights to use college premises for political meetings.Cecil, A Divided Life (1989), p. 32. In his last year, 1934, Donald Maclean became an agent of the Soviet Union's People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, abbreviated from the Russian as NKVD. Established in 1917 as Cheka of Russian SFSR, the agency was originally tasked with conducting suppression of all \\"counter- revolutionary\\" activities and overseeing the country's prisons and labor camps. Maclean was recruited by Theodore \\"Teddy\\" Maly, a Hungarian Catholic priest turned Soviet \\"illegal\\" (a spy operating without a diplomatic cover). Maly lived in London posing as a businessman, having arrived on a forged Austrian passport.Polmer and Allen, The Spy Book, p. 352. Appropriately enough for a man who had once been a Catholic priest, Maly who was known to the Cambridge Five simply as Theo, acted as a sort of confessional figure for the Cambridge Five. Maclean was then instructed to give up political activity and enter the Diplomatic Service, where at the right moment he would best be able to serve the cause.Cecil, A Divided Life (1989), pp. 35‚Äì36. He graduated with a First in Modern Languages and abandoned his earlier ideas of teaching English in the Soviet Union when pressed by fellow Communists at Cambridge. After spending a year preparing for the Civil Service examinations, Maclean passed with first-class honours.Cecil, A Divided Life (1989), p. 37. At the Final Board, Maclean was asked by one of the panel interviewing him, whether he had favoured communism while a university student, ostensibly because the panel knew of a trip he had taken to Moscow in his second year at Cambridge. Maclean lied: \\"At Cambridge, I was initially favourable to it but I am little by little getting disenchanted with it.\\" His apparent sincerity satisfied members of the panel, which included a family friend, Lady Violet Bonham Carter. London In August 1935, Maclean was examined by the Civil Service Commission and duly admitted to the diplomatic service. In October, he started work at the Foreign Office, and was assigned to the Western department that dealt with the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, and Switzerland, as well as the League of Nations.Cecil, A Divided Life (1989), pp. 39‚Äì43. In 1936, Maclean became closely involved in the work of the Non-Intervention Committee set up to monitor the activities of the chief powers, Germany, Italy, and the USSR and their involvement in determining the outcome of the Spanish Civil War. To Maclean, his traitorous involvement was a justifiable decision, in hopes of furthering Soviet policy. Just a few years before, in 1935, his fellow Soviet spy Guy Burgess had this to say about their involvement in espionage, \\"Everyone gives away information. When Churchill was in opposition he used to give away confidential information about what the government was thinking to Maisky, then Russian ambassador.\\" He disastrously thought that Maclean and he were in much the same position as Churchill.Spender, Sir S., Journals: 1939‚Äì83, London: Faber, 1985, p. 215. In the summer of 1937, the agent that recruited Maclean, Theodore \\"Teddy\\" Maly, left for Paris and anxiously debated his future with other non-Soviet illegals. Knowing he was gravely menaced by Stalin's purge, Maly still left for Moscow and was never heard from again.Cecil, A Divided Life (1989), p. 48. Maly was arrested upon his return, tortured and executed on the spurious charges of spying for Hungary against the Soviet Union.Polmer and Allen The Spy Book, p. 352. For a time, multiple meetings passed where no one showed to meet Maclean. Then Kitty Harris (wife of the Communist Party of the USA's party leader) arrived in place of his usual controller and gave the recognition phrase. \\"You hadn't expected to see a lady, had you?\\" she said. \\"No, but it's a pleasant surprise\\", he replied. Maclean would visit Harris's flat in Bayswater after work, with documents to photograph. Over the next two years, 45 boxes of documents were photographed and sent to Moscow. \\"She was a cut-out between Maclean and his NKVD controller\\", said Geoffrey Elliott, who wrote a book about her with Igor Damaskin, a former KGB officer.Elliott, Geoffrey, and Igor Damaskin, Kitty Harris: The Spy with Seventeen Names, London: St Ermin's Press, 2001. He was then placed under the operational control of GPU rezident, Anatoli Gorsky. Gorsky, who was appointed in 1939 after the entire London rezidentura was liquidated, used Vladimir Borisovich Barkovsky, a recent graduate of Moscow's Intelligence School as the case officer for Maclean. Paris In the autumn of 1938, Maclean had nearly completed three years as a junior member of the League of Nations and the Western department of the Foreign Office and he argued that he was overdue for transfer to his first foreign post. There being no lack of drive in Maclean's ego, he was sent to the prestigious post in Paris. On 24 September 1938, he took up his post as Third Secretary at HM Embassy, Paris. Although Maclean strove to closely conform to the normalities representative of the Foreign Office social class, he lacked the funds and savoir-faire of his colleagues. As a striver, he was mocked by the typing pool as Fancy-Pants Maclean.Cecil, A Divided Life (1989), pp. 50‚Äì51. Ronnie Campbell was to have a crucial impact on Maclean as well as his career. Another was Michael Wright, who was the senior First Secretary and always appreciated Maclean's drafting skills. In the spring of 1939, an Anglo-French attempt was made to include the Soviet Union into the \\"peace front\\" that was intended to deter German aggression. Because of the French involvement in these Moscow negotiations, the telegrams passing between embassies allowed Maclean access to a privy of information. Maclean kept Moscow informed in regard to relations between Germany and the British Empire, on the one hand, and Britain and France on the other, as the French foreign minister Georges Bonnet worked to end French security commitments in Eastern Europe. He also kept Moscow informed about the development of Anglo-French plans for intervention in the war between Finland and the Soviet Union.Michael Holzman, Donald and Melinda Maclean: Idealism and Espionage, Briarcliff Manor, New York: The Chelmsford Press, 2014. One evening in December 1939 in Paris, Maclean met Melinda Marling. The daughter of a Chicago oil executive, she was a teenager when her parents had divorced, her mother moving to Europe. In October 1929, Melinda and her sisters went to school at Vevey, near Lausanne, where their mother rented a villa, and spent their holidays at Juan-les-Pins in France.Geoffrey Hoare, The Missing Macleans, New York: The Viking Press, 1955. Melinda Marling's mother moved to New York, marrying Charles Dunbar, an executive in the paper industry, and brought her daughters to live with them in Manhattan, where Melinda Marling attended the Spence School. After graduation she spent some months in New York City then returned to Paris, where she enrolled at the Sorbonne in Paris to study French literature.'Holzman: Donald and Melinda Maclean: Idealism and Espionage, '2014. Melinda Marling was introduced to Maclean, in the Caf√© Flore in December 1939, possibly by Mark Culme-Seymour. Culme-Seymour later described her as \\"quite pretty and vivacious, but rather reserved. I thought that she was a bit prim. She was always well-groomed, lipstick bright, hair permed, a double row of pearls around her neck. Her interests seemed limited to family, friends, clothes and Hollywood movies.\\"The Guardian (Manchester and London), 10 May 2003. In the 1950s, Culme-Seymour tracked down the exiled Macleans in Moscow, and another Melinda emerged. She told him that she knew she would be going to Russia right from the beginning, even before Maclean defected. Soviet archives confirm this view. As Maclean told Harris, on the evening he met Melinda, he saw more to her \\"I was very taken by her views. She's a liberal, she's in favour of the Popular Front and doesn't mind mixing with communists even though her parents are well-off. There was a White Russian girl, one of her friends, who attacked the Soviet Union and Melinda went for her. We found we spoke the same language.\\" Maclean had told Melinda Marling about his role as a spy. He told Harris that Marling not only reacted positively, but \\"actually promised to help me to the extent that she can and she is well connected in the American community\\". On 10 June 1940, as the German Army approached Paris, Donald Maclean and a pregnant Melinda Marling were married at the local Mairie. The British Embassy was evacuated and the Macleans drove south with one of Donald Maclean's colleagues. Few marriages could have begun in greater turmoil. On 13 June, the Military Attach√© gave warning that \\"if the Embassy party did not at once cross the Loire, they might be cut off.\\"Cecil, A Divided Life (1989), p. 62. They were able to escape France on a small merchant ship and went to London. London in World War II Maclean continued to report to Moscow from London, where he was assigned by the British Foreign Office to work on economic warfare matters. Maclean became the Foreign Office's expert in economic warfare, civil air matters, military base negotiations and natural resources useful in the war, such as tungsten. It was in 1940, after the fall of France, that Maclean had two meetings with Philby, their first encounter since the mid-1930s.Cecil, A Divided Life (1989), p. 64. Three days before Christmas 1940, Melinda Maclean went to New York to have her baby, which died shortly after its birth. Some weeks later she flew back to London and went to work in the BBC bookstore. It was here that Gorsky became closely involved in Maclean's career in espionage.Cecil, A Divided Life (1989), p. 66. It was also around this time that Maclean began to show his debauchery at Victor Rothschild's home where Blunt and Burgess were living. The Macleans became part of the social set that circulated between the Caf√© Royal, the Gargoyle Club and the country house weekends of the Liberal establishment. Donald Maclean was promoted and given the prestigious assignment as Second Secretary at the British Embassy in Washington.Holzman: Donald and Melinda Maclean: Idealism and Espionage, 2014. Towards the end of April 1944, the Macleans set sail in convoy for New York, where they arrived on 6 May. Washington Maclean served in Washington from 1944 to 1948, achieving promotion to First Secretary. In 1944, Maclean provided a copy of every cable to and from Sir Anthony Eden, the Foreign Secretary, to Lord Halifax, the ambassador, to the NKVD.Polmar and Allen, The Spy Book, p. 348. Melinda Maclean was again pregnant, giving birth to a son in New York City. The Macleans frequently visited Melinda Maclean's mother and stepfather in Manhattan and at Dunbar's country place in the Berkshires. They vacationed on Long Island and Cape Cod with Mrs. Dunbar and Melinda Maclean's sisters. The Macleans became part of the liberal Georgetown social set in Washington, which included Katharine Graham, as well as participating in the diplomatic life of the city.Holzman, Donald and Melinda Maclean: Idealism and Espionage, 2014. Maclean never passed on any information to his handler in Washington, instead going to New York on a weekly basis, and so frequent were his trips to New York that his colleagues believed he had a mistress there.Polmer and Allen The Spy Book, p. 348. Maclean was considered to be an exceptionally hard worker at the embassy as his fellow diplomat Robert Cecil remembered in 1989: \\"No task was too hard for him; no hours were too long. He gained the reputation of one who would always take over a tangled skein from a colleague who was sick, or going on leave, or simply less zealous. In this way he was able to manoeuvre himself into the hidden places that were of the most interest to the NKVD\\". On 15 June 1945, the American columnist Drew Pearson in his 'Washington Merry-Go- Round' column published details of a secret letter sent from Churchill to President Truman together with details of talks between Harry Hopkins and Stalin. In response, the FBI, which suspected that the leak came from someone within the British Embassy began an investigation, which led them to place Maclean under surveillance after he was observed going into a gay bar. The FBI believed that Maclean was a homosexual being blackmailed into leaking information by Pearson and discovered that Maclean was a heavy drinker who often engaged in random sexual encounters with various men, but failed to discover that he was a Soviet spy. Towards the end of that period Donald Maclean acted as Secretary of the Combined Policy Committee on atomic energy matters. He was Moscow's main source of information about US/UK/Canada atomic energy policy development. Although Maclean did not transmit technical data on the atom bomb, he reported on its development and progress, particularly the amount of plutonium (used in the Fat Man bombs) available to the United States. As the British representative on the American-British-Canadian Council on the sharing of atomic secrets, he was able to provide the Soviet Union with information from Council meetings. This gave Soviet scientists the ability to predict the number of bombs that could be built by the Americans. Coupled with the efforts of Los Alamos-based scientists Alan Nunn May, Klaus Fuchs, and Theodore Hall (who had been identified but was allowed to remain at large), Maclean's reports to his NKVD controller gave the Soviets a basis to estimate their nuclear arsenal's relative strength against that of the United States and Britain. In addition to atomic energy matters, Maclean's responsibilities at the Washington embassy included civil aviation, bases, post-hostilities planning, Turkey and Greece, NATO and Berlin. It has been reported that Maclean suggested to Moscow that the goal of the Marshall Plan was to ensure American economic domination in Europe. Maclean's cover name was \\"Homer\\". Cairo In 1948, Maclean was appointed head of Chancery at the British embassy in Cairo. He was at that time the youngest Counsellor in the British foreign service. As soon as he arrived, Maclean had problems with his MGB contact, who arranged their meetings in an unsatisfactory manner. Maclean suggested that Melinda should simply pass his information to the wife of the Soviet resident at the hairdresser. \\"Melinda was quite prepared to do this\\", Modin reports.Modin, Yuri Ivanovitch, My Five Cambridge Friends, Headline Book Publishing, London, 1994. Cairo was an important post, the key to British power in the area and a central point in Anglo-American planning for war with the Soviet Union. At this time Britain was the major power in the Middle East with troops in both the Canal Zone and nearby Palestine and airbases in the Canal Zone from which American atomic bombers could reach the Soviet Union. In regard to Egypt itself, British policy was one of laissez-faire or non- interference with the corruption surrounding King Farouk. Maclean disagreed strongly and felt that Britain should encourage reform which alone, in his opinion, could save the country from communism. \\"And, except to stress its dangers, that was all I ever heard Donald say about communism.\\" recalls Geoffrey Hoare, the News Chronicle Cairo correspondent.Hoare, The Missing Macleans, 1955. Maclean was considered the key official in the Cairo Embassy, specifically responsible for coordinating US/UK war planning and, under the Ambassador, relations with the Egyptian government.Holzman, and Melinda Maclean: Idealism and Espionage, 2014. By now, his double life was beginning to affect Maclean. He began drinking, brawling and talking about his life. After a drunken episode which resulted in the wrecking of an American embassy staffer's apartment, Melinda told the ambassador that Donald was ill and needed leave to see a London doctor. It is possible that this series of events was contrived to provide a way for Maclean to return to England as American intelligence was getting close to identifying Maclean as a Soviet agent by means of the VENONA messages. At this time Melinda Maclean was having an affair with an Egyptian aristocrat, with whom she travelled to Spain when Donald Maclean went to England. London deskbound After a few months rest Maclean recovered from the troubles of his Egyptian period and Melinda Maclean agreed to return to the marriage, immediately becoming pregnant. Maclean's career did not seem to suffer from the events in Egypt. He was promoted and made head of the American Department in the Foreign Office, perhaps its most important assignment for an officer at Maclean's level. This allowed him to continue to keep Moscow informed about Anglo-American relations and planning. The most important report Maclean sent to Moscow concerned the emergency summit in Washington in December 1950 between the British Prime Minister Clement Attlee and U.S. President Harry S. Truman.Polmer and Allen The Spy Book, p. 349 After China entered the Korean War, there were demands both outside and inside the U.S. government, most notably by General Douglas MacArthur, that the U.S attack China with nuclear weapons. The British were strongly opposed to both the use of nuclear weapons and escalating the war by attacking China, and Attlee had gone to Washington with the aim of stopping both. Truman reassured Attlee at the Washington summit that he would not allow the use of nuclear weapons or take the war outside of Korea.Polmer and Allen The Spy Book, p. 349. Maclean provided a transcript of what was said at the Truman-Attlee summit to Yuri Modin, the \\"control\\" of the Cambridge spy ring. Meanwhile, the American and British governments were concluding that Maclean was indeed a Soviet agent, a process carefully tracked by Kim Philby in Washington. The journalist Cyril Connolly described him vividly as he struck him in London in 1951. \\"He had lost his serenity, his hands would tremble, his face was usually a livid yellow ... he was miserable and in a very bad way. In conversation, a kind of shutter would fall as if he had returned to some basic and incommunicable anxiety.\\"Cyril Connolly: The Missing Diplomats. London: The Queen Anne Press, 1952. Detection Maclean's role was discovered when the VENONA decryption was carried out at Arlington Hall, Virginia and Eastcote in London between 1945 and 1951. These related to coded messages between New York, Washington and Moscow for which Soviet code clerks had re-used one-time pads. The cryptanalysts working as part of the Venona project, discovered that twelve coded cables had been sent, six from New York from June to September 1944 and six from Washington in April 1945, by an agent named Gomer. The first cable sent but not the first to be deciphered described a meeting with Sergei on 25 June and Gommer's (sic) forthcoming trip to New York where his wife was living with her mother awaiting the birth of a child. This was decoded in April 1951. A short list of nine men was identified as possible Homers (Gomer is the Russian form of Homer), one of whom was Maclean.Lamphere, Robert, and Tom Shactman, The FBI-KGB War, New York: Random House, 1986, pp. 232‚Äì237. The second cable on 2‚Äì3 August 1944 was a description, but not a transcript, of a message from Churchill to Roosevelt, which Homer claimed to have decrypted. It suggested that Churchill was trying to persuade Roosevelt to abandon plans for Operation Anvil, the invasion of Provence, in favour of an attack through Venice and Trieste into Austria. This was typical of Churchill's strategic thinking since he was always looking for a flanking move. But it was rejected outright by both American and British generals.S. J. Hamrick, Publisher Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1999, p. 233. Shortly after the VENONA investigation began, Kim Philby, another member of the Cambridge Five, was assigned to Washington, serving as Britain's CIA-FBI-NSA liaison. He saw the VENONA material, and recognised that Maclean was Homer, which was confirmed by his KGB control. Believing that Maclean would confess to MI5, Philby and Guy Burgess decided that Burgess would travel to London, where Maclean was head of the Foreign Office's American desk, to warn him. Burgess received three speeding tickets in a single day. The Governor complained to the British Ambassador and Burgess went back to London, in disgrace. The Soviets were desperate for Maclean to get out, fearful that in his current state he would crack immediately under interrogation. Maclean sounded out Melinda about the defection. According to Modin, she responded: \\"They're quite right ‚Äì go as soon as you can, don't waste a single moment.\\" Defection The day eventually earmarked for Maclean to make his escape happened to be his thirty- eighth birthday: 25 May 1951. He came home by train from the Foreign Office to their house in Kent as usual that evening, and soon after Guy Burgess, who had just been persuaded to get out too, turned up. After eating the birthday supper that Melinda had prepared, Maclean said goodbye to his wife and children, got into Burgess's car and left. They drove to Southampton, took a ferry to France, then disappeared from view, sparking a media and intelligence furore. It was five years before Khrushchev finally admitted that they were in the Soviet Union. The following Monday, Melinda Maclean telephoned the Foreign Office to ask coolly if her husband was around. Her pose of total ignorance convinced them; MI5 put off interviewing her for nearly a week, and the Maclean house was never searched. No doubt their readiness to see her merely as the ignorant wife was enhanced by the fact that she was heavily pregnant at the time ‚Äì three weeks after Donald left, she gave birth to their third child, a daughter. Francis Marling, Melinda's father, flew from New York to help. Friends in the State Department gave him Foreign Office contacts who proved unhelpful. He returned to New York with a low opinion of Foreign Office officials. He felt then, as others felt later, that no serious effort was being made. Moscow Maclean, unlike Burgess, assimilated into the Soviet Union and became a respected citizen, learning Russian, earning a doctorate and serving as a specialist on the economic policy of the West and British foreign affairs. Burgess learned only enough Russian to just manage to get by in Moscow while Maclean worked very hard at becoming fluent in Russian.Polmar and Allen, The Spy Book, p. 349. After a brief period of teaching English in Kuybyshev (now Samara) at a Russian provincial school, Maclean joined the staff of International Affairs in early 1956 as a specialist on British home and foreign policy and relations between the Soviet Union and NATO. He shared a small room with his new Soviet colleagues on the second floor of the journal's premises on Gorokhovsky Pereulok.\\"Secret Agent Donald Maclean at \\"International Affairs\\" Author(s): Tatyana IEVLEVA; Source International Affairs, No. 1, Vol. 41, 1995, pp. 97‚Äì98. He also worked for the Soviet Foreign Ministry and the Institute of World Economy and International Relations.Polmar and Allen, The Spy Book, p. 349. In 1956, the Soviet government first revealed that Maclean and Burgess were living in Moscow, though the TASS statement denied that they were spies, claiming that they had gone behind the Iron Curtain to \\"further understanding between East and West\\" for the sake of world peace.Polmar and Allen, The Spy Book, p. 349. He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour and the Order of Combat. His publications for IMEMO were under the name of S. Madzoevsky. In the 1970s, Maclean used his prestige with the KGB to protect members of the early dissident movement. He seems to have had some contact with Sakharov and Roy and Zhores Medvedev and shortly before his death wrote a critique of the retrograde development of Soviet society. Melinda Maclean and their children joined Maclean in Moscow more than a year after his defection. Melinda was aware of her risks as a collaborator to her husband; two months earlier, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg had been executed for spying. But Melinda usually concealed her thoughts behind an expressionless look. \\"I will not admit that my husband, the father of my children, is a traitor to his country\\", she would say in outraged tones. Extramarital affairs and later family life The Macleans had three surviving children: Fergus, born in 1944, Donald, in 1946, and Melinda, in 1951.Little Lost Lambs (accessed 12 August 2007) The Maclean marriage came under pressure in Moscow as Donald Maclean continued to drink heavily until the mid-1960s, becoming violent when drunk. Kim Philby and Melinda Maclean became lovers during a ski trip in 1964, while Eleanor Philby, Philby's American wife, was on an extended visit to the US. Maclean found out and broke with Philby. Eleanor Philby discovered the affair on her return and left Moscow, for good. Melinda moved in with Philby in 1966, but within three years tired of him and left. She returned to her husband, and remained with him until she left Moscow for good in 1979. Melinda returned to the West to be with her mother and sisters; her children soon followed her. She died in New York in 2010 without saying a single word to the media.Melindia Maclean died in February 2010. Kim Philby Was Here by Ambassador Richard Carlson and Buckley Carlson in Foundation for Defense of Democracies (accessed 12 August 2007)Ivanova, Rufina et al., The Private Life of Kim Philby: The Moscow Years (2000). The three Maclean children all married Russians, but left Moscow to live in London and the U.S, as they still had the right to British or American passports. Fergus, the eldest son, enrolled at University College London in 1974, prompting a question in Parliament.Hansard, 25 January 1974, vol. 867 c377W. Donald's son, Donald, married firstly Lucy, daughter of George Hanna, an English man who worked for the BBC and was a friend of the family.Cecil, Robert, A Divided Life: A biography of Donald Maclean, Bodley Head, 1988, p. 178. They had a son, Donald Duart Maclean's only grandson (who was born in 1970), who resides in the UK. Death Maclean was reported seriously ill with pneumonia in December 1982,Lucy Hodges, \\"Maclean may have pneumonia\\", The Times, 6 December 1982, p. 1. and was housebound after his recovery.\\"Death of Maclean rumoured\\", The Times, 11 March 1983, p. 1. The Institute of World Economy and International Relations, Maclean's workplace, reported his death at the age of 69 on 6 March 1983. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered on his parents' grave in the churchyard of Holy Trinity Church, Penn, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom. Twenty years previously, Guy Burgess's ashes had also been scattered on his family grave in England.Cecil, Robert. A Divided Life: A Personal Portrait of the Spy Donald Maclean. New York: William Morrow and Company, Inc., 1989. Legacy In May 1970, Hodder & Stoughton published Maclean's book British Foreign Policy since Suez which he wrote for a British readership. Maclean told journalists that he set out to analyse the subject rather than to attack it, but criticised British diplomatic support for the United States in the Vietnam War. He stated that he would donate the British royalties to the British Committee for Medical Aid to Vietnam.\\"Maclean: European manqu√©\\" (The Times Diary), The Times, 30 April 1970, p. 10. He foresaw a strengthening of British influence in the 1970s and 1980s as a result of economic recovery. Interviewed live by a BBC Radio reporter who detected a nostalgia for Britain in the book, Maclean refused to be drawn on whether he would like to return to London, for further research for his next book. After his death, his body was cremated and per his will, his ashes were buried in Britain. Of the five spies that made up the Cambridge Spy Ring, Maclean was not the best known, but he provided the most intelligence of value to the Soviet Union as his position as a senior diplomat in the Foreign Office gave access to more information than what could be accessed by Philby, Cairncross, Blunt or Burgess as he was able to provide the Soviets with \\"the most intimate details\\" of Anglo-American decision-making on such matters as the future of nuclear energy and the founding of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In an official American appraisal concluded: \\"In the fields of US/UK/Canada planning on atomic energy, US/UK post-war planning and policy in Europe, all information up the date of Maclean's defection undoubtedly reached Soviet hands\\".

Headquartered in Durham, North Carolina, it serves Moore, Lee, Chatham, Orange, Durham, Wake, and Johnston counties. History The TJCOG was originally established in 1959 by the Research Triangle Foundation as the Research Triangle Regional Planning Commission. The commission's original members were Durham, Orange and Wake counties, and the cities of Chapel Hill, Durham, and Raleigh. When the North Carolina General Assembly established 18 regional planning councils in 1972, the Research Triangle Regional Planning Commission was reorganized as the planning council for Region J, which consisted of Durham, Orange, Wake, Chatham, Johnston and Lee counties. Moore County was added when the planning commission for Region H was abolished.

Stockholm Olympic Stadium was the homeground of DIF's football team for many decades until the more modern Tele2 Arena was inaugurated in 2013. It is still (2018) the home ground for the women's team and DIF has offices in the Olympic Stadium. Djurg√•rdens Idrottsf√∂rening, commonly known simply as Djurg√•rdens IF, Djurg√•rden (), and (especially locally) Djurg√•r'n (), Dif or DIF ‚Äì is a Swedish sports club with several departments, located in Stockholm. Name The club is named after the City Park and borough Djurg√•rden, which originally was a royal hunting park. A direct translation of Djurg√•rden would be ‚Äúanimal garden‚Äù or \\"animal yard\\". The word djur means \\"animal\\" but has the same etymology as the word ‚Äúdeer‚Äù, meaning \\"deer garden\\" may have been its original meaning. History The club was founded in 1891 by a group of young athletes living in the borough and port district Djurg√•rdsstaden on Djurg√•rden in central Stockholm. Most of the founders were from the shipping industry working class, and Djurg√•rden maintained that profile for most of its early history, in sharp contrast with middle class rivals AIK.Andersson, Torbj√∂rn (2002) \\"Kung fotboll: den svenska fotbollens kulturhistoria fr√•n 1800-talets slut\\" With an original focus on winter sports and athletics, the club quickly branched into other sports, becoming one of Sweden's most successful sports clubs of the 20th and 21st century. The club started playing association football in 1899 and soon started a derby rivalry with neighbouring club AIK, the so-called tvillingderbyt. Today the most popular sections are ice hockey and football, with 16 and 12 Swedish national championship titles respectively. Other popular sections are bandy, handball and floorball. The club has won 441 Swedish championships through 2017, with this Djurg√•rden is the most successful sports club in Sweden, it is also more championship titles than the two main rivals AIK and Hammarby have together. Logo and colours The first logo of the club was a four-pointed silver star in saltire, which had a shield on it with the letters DIF. This star pre-dates the similar star which Idrottsf√∂reningen Kamraterna adopted and is using to this day. The present logo in the form of a shield in yellow, red and blue with the text D.I.F. was adopted in 1896. According to an often-quoted poem by Johan af Klercker from 1908, blue and yellow stand for Sweden and red stands for love. Blue and yellow are also the colours of Stockholm and yellow, red and blue are the colors of the crest of Stockholm County. Yellow, red and blue are the club colours. The logo is registered as a trademark and the colours are set to Pantone, CMYK and web colour values. In many sports ‚Äì among them football, bandy and handball ‚Äì the home jersey of the team is vertically striped in light and dark blue. Because of this, blue is usually seen as the most important of the three colours. The ice hockey team uses jerseys in one blue shade with yellow and red details. Departments Djurg√•rdens IF has a number of member departments, all of which legally are their own clubs with their own financial and sporting responsibilities but share the common name, logo and values and support each other. Major departments * Djurg√•rdens IF Fotboll ‚Äì football. * Djurg√•rdens IF Hockey ‚Äì ice hockey.

One of these was ski jumping and DIF was one of the best clubs in Sweden in this sport for fifty years. Fans and fan culture Djurg√•rden is one of the most supported clubs in Sweden, with most of its supporters living in Stockholm and the neighbouring suburbs. While other Stockholm clubs have profiled themselves as belonging to a certain borough of Stockholm, Djurg√•rden is seen as more of a pan-Stockholm club. No reliable research exists about the spread of Djurg√•rden supporters, but a 2015 T-shirt campaign suggests that supporters are spread fairly evenly throughout the Stockholm area. In 1981 the main supporter club \\"Blue Saints\\" was formed, but due to its notorious fans and their bad reputation, the supporter club changed its name to J√§rnkaminerna, literally \\"The Iron Furnaces\\" (an old nickname for Djurg√•rden athletes from the 1950s). Since 2005, Fabriken is Djurg√•rden's TIFO group; they have two ultras groups: UCS (Ultra caos Stockholm) and Ultras Sthlm. Djurg√•rden is probably one of a few clubs in the world who is represented both in space (by Christer Fuglesang) and in the Himalayas (by Raul Helander). Through the years, many types of souvenirs and memorabilia has been made for the club. Stuffed toys in the form of a rabbit called J√§rnkanin (\\"Iron Rabbit\\") are sold, the name a pun on the word J√§rnkamin. Club beers A couple of beers have been created over the years. At present, Alberget 4A is sold for Djurg√•rdens IF. It is named for the address of the caf√© where the club was founded. The beer was launched in 2013 and is sold through Djurg√•rdshj√§lpen, a supporter initiative to raise money for the sports club. Originally, the beer was called Alltid oavsett (\\"always, no matter what\\"), which is a slogan often used by supporters of Djurg√•rdens IF. The beer is a pale lager of 5.0% abv made by Grebbestad Bryggeri on behalf of Djurg√•rdshj√§lpen and is not part of Grebbestad Bryggeri's own range of beers.

The name stands for Kod Obmena Informatsiey () which means \\"Code for Information Interchange\\". A particular feature of the KOI code pages is that the text remains human-readable when the leftmost bit is stripped, should it inadvertently pass through equipment or software that can only deal with 7 bit wide characters. This is due to characters being placed in a special order (128 codepoints apart from the Latin letter they sound most similar to), which, however, does not correspond to the alphabetic order in any language that is written in Cyrillic and necessitates the use of lookup tables to perform sorting. These encodings are derived from ASCII on the base of some correspondence between Latin and Cyrillic (nearly phonetical), which was already used in Russian dialect of Morse code and in MTK-2 telegraph code. The first 26 characters from –ê (0xE1) in KOI8-R are –ê, –ë, –¶, –î, –ï, –§, –ì, –•, –ò, –ô, –ö, –õ, –ú, –ù, –û, –ü, –Ø, –†, –°, –¢, –£, –ñ, –í, –¨, –´, –ó.  KOI-7  The original KOI encoding (1967) was a 7-bit code page named KOI-7 (–ö–û–ò-7), which did not contain lowercase letters. In KOI-7, the codes of the 31 or 32 Russian letters are ordered according to the Latin letters. Other code points are the same as in ASCII (however, the dollar sign $ (code point 24hex) may be replaced by the universal currency sign ¬§).  KOI-8  KOI-8 (–ö–û–ò-8), standardized in 1974 by GOST 19768, is an 8-bit extensions of ASCII. Originally it only included 32 lowercase and 31 uppercase Russian letters. Later derivatives of KOI-8 constitute the family of encodings variously known as KOI8, KOI 8 and KOI-8.

After the fire, the governor Alexander Grantham launched a public housing programme to introduce the idea of \\"multi storey building\\" for the immigrant population living there. The standardised new structures offered fire- and flood-resistant construction to previously vulnerable hut dwellers. The programme involved demolishing the rest of the makeshift houses left untouched by the fire, and the construction of the Shek Kip Mei Low-cost Housing Estate in their stead. The apartments were small, only about . Each unit could house five people, and each building had a capacity of 2,500 residents.Wiltshire, Trea. [First published 1987] (republished & reduced 2003).

The Shek Kip Mei Myth: Squatters, Fires And Colonial Rulers in Hong Kong, 1950‚Äì1963. At the north of Shek Kip Mei is Tai Wo Ping (), along Beacon Hill. This was a cottage area (a type of resettlement accommodation) from the 1950s to 1970s, but it has been developed into a public housing estate, Chak On Estate (), and two private housing estates, Beacon Heights () and Dynasty Heights ().Tai Wo Ping Cottage Area Hong Kong in the Post War Years Present The Government has backed off from its plans to redevelop the area, following great opposition from many who believe they symbolised the history of Hong Kong. An alternative plan to renovate it for use as a hostel and museum has been completed. The museum includes restored rooms, resident stories and photos, and documentation of the history of public housing estates. Shek Kip Mei now has several types of housing including the public apartments, Pak Tin Estate and private housing such as Beacon Heights and Dynasty Heights. Several malls and churches can also be found in the area now. The old Shek Kip Mei Factory Estate was renovated and now serves as the Jockey Club Creative Arts Centre. Transportation Since 1 October 1979, it has been served by Shek Kip Mei station on the MTR at Woh Chai Street and Wai Chi Street. Route 7 (Hong Kong) passes to the north of the area and accessed via Nam Cheong Street. KMB and New World First Bus operates a number or routes that travel within the area.

Its features include subtractive synthesis, on-board effects, a joystick for data manipulation, and an analogue synthesis-styled layout design. The external Roland PG-1000 (1987-1990) programmer could also be attached to the D-50 for more complex manipulation of its sounds. It was also produced in a rack-mount variant design, the D-550 (1987-1990), with almost 450 user- adjustable parameters. The D-50's capabilities could be modified through the addition of third-party products by Musitronics, most notably the M-EX which made the D-50 multitimbral (the D-50 was bi-timbral) and expanded the patch memory, as well as a chip that improved the D-50's response to incoming MIDI commands and a system for burning custom PCM cards with user samples for playback in the D-50.Mark Vail, Vintage Synthesizers, Miller Freeman, 1993, p. 63 The D-50 was used in popular music by many artists including Jean-Michel Jarre, Prince, Sting, Michael Jackson and Enya. History The D-50 was the first affordable synthesizer to combine sample playback with subtractive synthesis. The engineers at Roland determined that the most difficult component of an instrument's sound to simulate realistically is the attack. To better emulate realistic sounds, the D-50 included almost 100 attack samples in ROM. The synthesizer played back an attack sample which was dove-tailed with more conventional subtractive synthesis to create the sustain of the sound. This dual-use method was required in 1987 since RAM was so expensive. Roland did, however, incorporate a number of \\"texture\\" samples that could be mixed into the synthesized sustain-part of a patch. These sustain samples gave many D-50 patches a lush and airy quality. The Roland D-50 was awarded a TEC Award for outstanding technical achievement in musical technology in 1988.1988 TEC Awards Technology Although the D-50 was among the first non-sampling machines to be able to produce sounds with sample-based characteristics, it was not long before many synthesizers on the market began using similar methods to create sounds. Roland later released a series of lower-priced keyboards and modules that allowed musicians who couldn't afford the relatively expensive flagship D-50 to have some of these sounds (Roland D-10 (1988), D-110 (rack version of D-10) (1988) D-20 (1988), D-5 (1989), MT-32). Though these lower priced D-series synthesizers did not contain the full \\"LA\\" synth engine, each was 8 part multi-timbral, and Roland doubled the number of onboard PCM samples. Roland also produced the 76-key, 6-octave \\"Super-LA\\" D-70 (1989-1990). With the D-70 Roland removed the digital synthesis section, which was replaced with full-length, more realistic and natural sounding samples, including an acoustic piano, which the D-50 lacked. The D-70 also had an expanded filter and effects section and was 5 part multi-timbral. Even with its improvements, however, the D-70 was unable to catch up with the dominant workstation of the time‚Äîthe Korg M1‚Äîand failed to become the next Roland flagship synthesizer. The D-50 produces a hybrid \\"analog/digital\\" sound: one can use traditional analog waveforms like saw, square and sine together with PCM samples of actual acoustic instrument attack transient, filtered through analog processing (LFOs, TVFs, TVAs, ring modulator, effects, etc.). This breakthrough led to the creation of totally new sounds never done before on either purely analog synths or digital samplers. Each D-50 sound (\\"patch\\") was made up of 2 \\"tones\\" (Upper and Lower) and each tone was made up of 2 \\"partials\\". Each partial could be either a \\"analog waveform\\" (pulse, sawtooth or sine waveform) and a VCF or a digital PCM waveform (sampled attack transient or looped sustain waveform). The partials could be arranged following 1 of 7 possible \\"structures\\" (algorithms), with a combination of either a PCM waveform or synthesized waveform, with an option to ring-modulate the two partials together. The synthesized waveforms could be pulse-width modulated and passed through an analog 4-stage Low-Pass filter, allowing for subtractive synthesis. The lower and upper part could be split or played in dual on the keyboard. The dual configuration allows an 8-voice polyphony bi- timbrality while only one partial plays, which allows for 32 voices.Julian Colbeck, Keyfax Omnibus Edition, MixBooks 1996, p. 97-100 Not only was the synthesis method new; the D-50 was arguably the first commercial synthesizer to include digital effects such as chorus and reverb, adding to the characteristically bright, rich, lively and sometimes realistic sound, featured on countless records of the period. Each of those effects had 10+ variations with editable parameters usually found in dedicated rack effects processors rather than keyboard synths. It was also on the forefront of the change of the look of a typical keyboard player on stage: instead of being surrounded with multiple instruments, with more versatile instruments and the continued adoption of the MIDI standard, they were starting to appear with only one or two keyboards, typically a D-50 with either Yamaha DX7 or Korg M1. The D-50 was fully MIDI-compatible, though it transmits on only one channel. The keyboard was velocity- and after-touch-sensitive, and the keys were slightly \\"weighted\\" with metal for a higher-quality feel. It included 64 patches on-board, and 64 more patches were available on the expansion RAM card that was included. It uses a CR2032 lithium battery for memory backup. For its sound and build quality, and the unique synthesis method it featured, the D-50 has remained popular to this day. Its synthesis engine, in more or less updated forms, was used in Roland's JV and XP series synths, among others. Furthermore, in 2004, Roland released a VC-1 expansion card for V-Synth and VariOS synthesizers. It contained a modeled and updated D-50 synthesis engine and the original operating system, including factory- and all Roland \\"expansion cards\\" patches. Since the newer DAC chips sounded \\"cleaner\\" with less noise output and overall higher bit and sample rates, it included the option to simulate the D-50's \\"rougher\\" output. The D-550 is a rack-mount version of D-50, with fewer front panel controls, no joystick and sliders. It employs the same sound circuitry (the main circuit board is exactly the same in both, labeled \\"D-50/D-550\\") Legacy The D-50 was introduced in 1987 as the popularity of the Yamaha DX7 was declining, resulting in the D-50 being the most popular synthesizer on the market until the introduction of the Korg M1 the following year.Mark Vail, Vintage Synthesizers, Miller Freeman, 1993, p. 251 The D-50's synthesizer-on-top-of-samples-and-through-effects innovation was an influence on the M1, which went on to become Korg's top selling keyboard, until the release of the Korg Triton. In fact, this scheme was a common method of digital keyboard sound creation for more than a decade, until ROM and Flash RAM were finally inexpensive enough to store entire samples or multisamples. The presets of the D-50, authored by Eric Persing and Adrian Scott, were well received by the artists' community, and most of them can be heard on numerous commercial albums of the late 1980s. The D-50's factory presets have enjoyed a long legacy, as patches like \\"Digital Native Dance\\", \\"Staccato Heaven\\", \\"Fantasia\\", \\"Pizzagogo\\", \\"Glass Voices\\", and \\"Living Calliope\\" are so common that they border on cliche. Some other D-50 presets live on in every machine that conforms to the General MIDI specification, including \\"Fantasia\\" (alternatively called \\"New Age Pad\\"), \\"Soundtrack\\", \\"Atmosphere\\", and \\"Nylon Atmosphere\\". The Roland V-Synth and V-Synth XT can load a card which emulates the D-50. In this mode, they copy the D-50 almost perfectly, although they lose the more sophisticated V-Synth capabilities. On September 8, 2017, Roland announced the Roland D-05, a miniaturized version of the D-50, as part of their Boutique series. The instrument includes the original presets of the D-50, plus all of the ROM expansions Roland created for it. The instrument was released in October 2017. Also in 2017, Roland released a VST plugin version of the D-50.https://www.rolandcloud.com/catalog/legendary/d-50 via their Roland Cloud website.

The archetypal alfajor entered Iberia during the period of al-Andalus. It is produced in the form of a small cylinder and is sold either individually or in boxes containing several pieces. Etymology According to Spanish philologist and dialectologist Manuel Alvar L√≥pez, alfajor is an Andalusian variant of the Castilian alaj√∫, derived from the Arabic word ÿßŸÑŸÅÿßÿÆÿ±, al- fakher, meaning luxurious, and, contrary to some beliefs that it originated in the New World, was introduced to Latin America as alfajor. The word had been introduced into Spanish dictionaries in the 14th century. The publication of historical dictionaries of the Spanish language allows one to document both forms of the original alajur, written as alaj√∫ and alfajor. Alajur and multiple geographic variations are sweets made of a paste of almonds, nuts, breadcrumbs and honey. It is possible that alfajor and alaj√∫ were Arabisms introduced into the Spanish language in different places and times, and, supposing both came from the same etymology, from a linguistic point of view, alaj√∫ is probably an Arabism of Castillian Spanish, and so it is still alive in Cuenca, Toledo, Guadalajara and in la Sierra de la pe√±a de Francia; meanwhile the variation alfajor is Andalusian and Murcian. In the Americas, the word alfajor was not known until the 19th century. History In 712, the Arab general Musa ibn Nusair arrived in Algeciras with an army of 18,000 soldiers to undertake the conquest of Medina Sidonia, Alcal√° de Guadaira and Carmona. A similar sweet called ala√∫ is found in the Arabic-Hispanic cookbook Kitab al-Tabikh, by an anonymous author. The Spanish grammarian Nebrija noted the word for the first time in his Latin-Spanish Dictionary (1492) as: alfaxor or alaxur. In the 12th century, Raimundo Martin describes in his book Vocabulista another possible etymology of the Hispano-Arabic fasur, meaning \\"nectar\\". Preparation and presentation The regulations allow the use of only pure honey, almonds, nuts, breadcrumbs, sugar, flour and spices, such as aniseed, sesame, cilantro, cloves and cinnamon. The Protected Geographical Indication alfajores are meant to be presented in a cylindrical shape, with a minimum weight of 30 grams each, and with a minimum size of about 7 cm in length and a diameter of 1.5 cm. Each of them will be protected with a wrapping paper, and the ends made an ornament in a spiral shape with a ribbon out of the same paper. Once individually wrapped, they may be packaged in wood or cardboard boxes, but never in plastic. In Spain Spanish-style alfajores in Andalucia. In Spain, there are a variety of different recipes for preparing alfajores, but the most traditional contain flour, honey, almonds and several spices, such as cinnamon. Alfajores are most commonly sold around Christmas, but in Medina Sidonia, they are available year-round. The traditional Spanish alfajor has been produced in this town (where it is called an alaj√∫) since ancient times, and the recipe has been traditionally handed down from father to son. Alfajores are still made by craftsmen in Medina Sidonia using natural ingredients that include honey, almonds, hazelnuts, sugar, flour, and breadcrumbs, and mixed with natural spices. The manufacturing process has been respected following a recipe found by Mariano Pardo de Figueroa in 1786. In Medina Sidonia, the annual production of approximately 45,000 kilograms is mostly consumed in the province of Cadiz, but they are also famous in Sevilla, Malaga and Huelva. On 15 September 2004, protected geographical indication was ratified by the Consejo de agricultura y pesca de la junta de Andalucia and published in the Official Journal of the European Union as Alfajor de Medina Sidonia on 6 March 2007. In the province of Cuenca, Spain, where the alfajor is called alaj√∫ it is made with almond, honey and figs, all wrapped in a wafer. Medina Sidonia was the capital for the Arabic world of confection, where the alfajor has centuries of history with a recipe that has been transmitted from generation to generation. In this town, there is an account of Mariano Pardo de Figueroa, a gastronomist better known by his pseudonym Doctor Thebussem, who documented the history of this sweet, wherein he wrote that on 2 July 1487, Enrique de Guzm√°n, second count of Medina Sidonia, ordered the council and majors of the region to send to Malaga 50 cows, 50 oxen, 200 calves and provision of alaj√∫ from his city. The recipe documented by the accounts of Thebussem in the 19th century is defined as the following: In South America In South America alfajores are found most notably in Argentina, Uruguay, Ecuador, Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, and Brazil. Alfajores have been popular in Argentina and Uruguay since the mid-19th century. However, these differ from the Spanish alfajores in that they are made with two round cookies with different sweet fillings between them. The filling is usually dulce de leche, although there are a lot of variations. They can be covered with powder sugar (the traditional ones), glazed sugar (Santafesinos or \\"de nieve\\"), grated coconut or chocolate. Argentina is today the world's largest consumer of alfajores, both in total numbers and in per capita calculations, being the most common snack for schoolchildren and adults.. Alfajores are also very popular in Peru, especially the artisanal types. Some of the best-known alfajor brands in South America are the Argentine \\"Jorgito\\", \\"Capit√°n del Espacio\\", \\"Guaymallen\\", \\"Suchard\\", \\"Havanna\\", \\"Cachafaz\\", the Uruguayan \\"Punta Ballena\\", \\"Sierra de Minas\\", \\"Alfajores Portezuelo\\", \\"Marley\\", and Peruvian \\"Casa del Alfajor\\". In the Caribbean In Puerto Rico, they underwent creolization, lost their almond and gained ground cassava. They can take varying amounts of sugar and spices. It's possible that Puerto Rico's most common version of this dessert (South American version with dulce de leche) reached Puerto Rico from Venezuela, but the opposite is also possible. Depending on region some add cornstarch, citrus zest, ginger and honey, filled with chocolate, vanilla cream, dulce de leche, fruit paste, or coconut. The filling can be mixed with almonds, sesame seeds, coconut flakes, or sprinkles. Variations in the Americas Uruguayan and Argentine alfajores Peruvian alfajores Traditional \\"alfajores\\" in Argentina, Peru, and Uruguay consist of two round, sweet biscuits made of wheat flour or corn starch joined together with dulce de leche (known as \\"manjar blanco\\" in Peru), and optionally coated with powdered sugar. More modern \\"industrial\\" varieties in Chile, Uruguay and Argentina, are coated with dark or white chocolate (many alfajores are sold in \\"black\\" and \\"white\\" versions), or simply covered with powdered sugar. These are also known as a Chilean Oreo. One variation is called \\"alfajor de nieve\\" (snow alfajor) and has a white coating consisting of a mixture of egg whites and sugar. Most alfajores come packaged in aluminium foil. Alfajores are made in various diameters and are consumed as snacks. In Mexico, \\"alfajores\\" are made with just coconut, and are normally a tri-color coconut confection. In Nicaragua, they are similar to the Canary island type of alfajores and are made with molasses and different grains including corn and cacao. They are often packaged in plastic wrap or wax paper. The Brazilian style of alfajor is commonly known as \\"bem-casado\\" (literally \\"well wed\\"), also filled with doce de leite and covered with thin sugar. There is also another candy known as \\"p√£o de mel\\" (meaning \\"honey bread\\" in Portuguese) that shares some features with alfajor, but more closely resembles a gingerbread. This variety is also coated with dark chocolate - like in Argentina, Uruguay and Chile - but has a cake-like texture on the inside and can be filled with doce de leite, chocolate and coconut cream. Other varieties include different elements in the preparation of the biscuits, such as peanuts, and a variety of fillings, coatings, or even the addition of a third biscuit (alfajor triple). Guinness World Record: the biggest South American alfajor According to Guinness World Records, the biggest alfajor in the world, measuring almost two meters in diameter and 80 centimeters in height and weighing 464 kilograms, was made on 11 December 2010 in Minas, Lavalleja Department, Uruguay. The giant alfajor was made to mark the celebration of Uruguay's first National Alfajor Festival. More than 30 people participated in the preparation of the record-breaking alfajor.

The mountain is colloquially called ≈†ara (). The section in Kosovo is a national park.  Etymology  In antiquity, the mountains were known as Scardus, Scodrus, or Scordus (œÑŒø Œ£Œ∫Œ¨œÅŒ¥ŒøŒΩ ·ΩÇœÅŒøœÇ in Polybius and Ptolemy). which evolved into its modern name. In the early 16th century, it was recorded that the mountain was called Catena Mundi (Latin for \\"the chains of the world\\"). Sometimes the range is called Carska Planina (, \\"Tsar's Mountain\\"), as a reference to the capitals (Prizren and Skopje), courts (Nerodimlje, Pauni, Svrƒçin, etc.) and monasteries (Monastery of the Holy Archangels) of the Serbian Empire located in the region. In the medieval period, Serbs called the mountain Mleƒçni (), because of the major milk production on the mountain and the vast herds of cattle, goats and sheep. In the golden bull issued by Emperor Du≈°an on 20 September 1349, he says: \\"I also bequest all of mine estates and areas around the Mleƒçni Mountain (\\"Milk Mountain\\"), the Durlev estates and all the metochions and all the wealth and treasure of that region\\". The bull is kept in the Dubrovnik Archive.  Borders  The mountain borders extend from the city of Prizren, following the two rivers of the Prizren Lumbardhi and the Lepenac. In the east it passes by the town of Ka√ßanik through the Kaƒçanik Gorge and into North Macedonia via the Polog valley. The border passes near the Vardar spring called Vrutok and enters near the valley of Mavrovo. There the Radika river separates the mountain massif from the higher Mount Korab. After that, the border is mounting, reaching the point of junction of three state borders: Kosovo, North Macedonia and Albania. The border now follows the road to the small, mountainous, town of Restelica, the rivers of Globocica, Plava and the White Drin and finally reaches the city of Prizren.

Many alpine and glacial mountain lakes are found on the Kosovar part of the ≈†ar Mountains, especially south of the village of Draga≈°, the area of Shutman and the region north of Vraca. The Brezovica ski resort, with an elevation of to above sea level, is located north-east of the mountains. The mountain range in Kosovo is divided into three main zones:The zone of Ljuboten and Brezovica, the central zone of Prizren and the zone of Opoja and Gora. The mountains border the Kosovo Plain to the north-east and the Dukagjini Valley in the northwest. Kosovo consists of the most eastern tip and the most northern part of the mountain ridge. The Ljuboten peak and the mountain of Skopska Crna Gora create the Kaƒçanik Gorge in Kosovo. The ≈†ar Mountains are split from the Nerodimka Mountain by the Siriniƒá Valley. The ≈†ar National Park is located in Kosovo. Villages and towns that are found near the mountain are: * Prizren largest city located at the foot of the mountains. * Ka√ßanik * Draga≈° * Brezovica * ≈†trpce Lakes in the Kosovo part of the ≈†ar Mountains are: * Big Ja≈æinaƒçko Lake * Small Ja≈æinaƒçko Lake * ≈†utmansko Lake * Lower Defsko Lake * ≈†trbaƒçko Lake * Black Vir Lake * Donji Vir Lake * Blate≈°ko Lake * Upper Defsko Lake * Dinivodno Lake In total, there are 70 glacial lakes on ≈†ara.  History  The remains of the ≈†iroko complex are located near Mu≈°uti≈°te. The complex originates from the period between the 10th and the 7th century BC, but also has medieval remnants. In Roman period, the mountain was a tripoint between the provinces of Dalmatia, Moesia and Macedonia. The route of an ancient road crossed the Scardus from 169 BC. The road was later named Velji (\\"Great\\") or Prizren road. Lisinski road was built. Remnants of the fort on the Kradi≈°te hill, near Prizren, dates from the 2nd to the 6th century and testifies the change of civilizations in this region: it started in the pre-Roman period, then became a Roman town and later a Byzantine one. Locality of Ravna Gora, predating the 6th century, where Slavs later cremated their dead, is situated in the area. Medieval military complex of Petriƒç Fortress, which consists of two fortresses, Little Petriƒç and Great Petriƒç, is also preserved. Remains of the Vi≈°egrad Fort, older part of the Prizren Fortress, are located in the gorge of the Bistrica river. When King Milutin donated lands to the Our Lady of Ljevi≈° church, he also donated the Vi≈°egrad Fort to serve as an Prizren's defence outpost. Emperor Du≈°an later expanded the fort to the river and built his endowment, the Monastery of the Holy Archangels. There are 45 Serbian Orthodox monasteries on the slopes of the mountain, dating from the 12th to the 16th century. Additional 32 monasteries were damaged or demolished during the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 and in the later years. Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God in the village of Gotovu≈°a in Siriniƒáka ≈Ωupa was built in 16th century. It was destroyed later and rebuilt in the second half of the 19th century. During the works in churchyard in the 2010s a floor mosaic was discovered from the much older church from the Byzantine period.  National park   History  ≈†ar Mountains National Park is in the territory of Kosovo and covers on the northern slopes of the ≈†ar Mountains as well as the mountains of O≈°ljak and Jezerce. The National Park \\"≈†ar-Planina Mt.\\" was proclaimed in 1986 within the temporary boundaries of , and opened in 1995.Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning(in Albanian) The final boundaries of the Park were expanded in 2012 to cover an area of .  Geography  The park occupies the northwest sections of the mountain's main massif, including the highest peak, Bistra, an spreads over the sections of Prevalac, O≈°ljak, Ostrovica and Kod≈æa Balkan. The park encompasses several different types of topographic relief: glacial (cirques, moraines and glacial lakes), periglacial (snow cirques, sliding blocks, \\"tundra mosaic\\" type of micro-shapes in the deposits of silt), karstic and fluvial. There are numerous rivers, springs, creeks, bogs and lakes.  Plant life  In total, there are 1,800 plant species. The mountain is inhabited by 175 strictly protected plant species, 247 Balkan endemites and 18 plants which can be found only on ≈†ara. The park includes the endemic relict Macedonian Pine and white-bark pine, as well as the mugo pine and Alpine rose. Other perennial plants include King Alexander's yarrow (Achillea alexandri-regis), Nikoliƒá's silene (Heliosperma nikolicii), Bornmuellera dieckii, ≈†ar carnation (Dianthus scardicus Wettst.), Doerfler's cinquefoils and Macedonian meadow saffron (Colhicum macedonicum). One of the relic species is Natalie's ramonda. It went extinct from the most of Europe during the last ice age and today grows as an endemic species in several gorges in Serbia, North Macedonia and Greece. It has been chosen as the Serbian symbol for the Armistice Day.  Animal life  Rusenica locality on the mountain has been in the first level of protection, as the strict reserve of nature, since 1955. It is one of the rare habitats of Balkan lynx, the largest European cat. It is estimated that on the entire Balkans there are no more than 100 specimens. European pond turtle and Hermann's tortoise, only two European species of freshwater turtles, live on the mountain. There are 147 butterfly species (excluding moths), 45 amphibians and reptilians and 37 mammalian species. Other animals include bear, chamois, wolf, roe deer, wild boar and other species including many bird species. The national park contains 720 chamois while the Opoja and Gora region contains 600 chamois. The National Park is administrated by the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP) of Kosovo.

Pensacola Beach is an unincorporated community located on Santa Rosa Island, a barrier island, in Escambia County, Florida, United States. It is situated south of Pensacola (and Gulf Breeze connected via bridges spanning to the Fairpoint Peninsula and then to the island) in the Gulf of Mexico. As of the 2000 census, the community had a total population of 2,738. Pensacola Beach occupies land bound by a 1947 deed from the United States Department of Interior that it be administered in the public interest by the county or leased, but never \\"disposed\\"; its businesses and residents are thus long-term leaseholders and not property owners.\\"Beach Leaseholders' Lawsuit Filed\\" Pensacola Beach Blog (December 21, 2004). Retrieved October 18, 2007. Pensacola Beach is part of the Pensacola‚ÄìFerry Pass‚ÄìBrent Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Escambia and Santa Rosa counties. History : Also see: History of Pensacola, Florida. Francisco Maldonado, a lieutenant \\"The Spanish Presence in Northwest Florida ‚Äì 1513 to 1705\\" (history), University of West Florida, 2006, webpage: UWF-hist. under Conquistador Hernando de Soto, visited the area during the early Spanish exploration of North America. He anchored in Pensacola Bay for the winter of 1539‚Äì1540. In 1559, Don Tristan de Luna y Arellano led the first settlement of the region. His 11 ships, with 1500 settlers, anchored in the bay and established its colony on the site of today's Naval Air Station Pensacola. A hurricane decimated the colony a few weeks later, killing hundreds and sinking five ships. Suffering long-term famine and fighting, this first settlement was finally abandoned in 1561. A presidio was constructed on Santa Rosa Island in 1722 near the location of the more recent Fort Pickens. Hurricanes in 1741 and 1752 forced its relocation to the mainland. Pensacola Beach for many years remained largely undeveloped. The Casino Resort was the first tourist destination constructed on the island (at the present day location of Casino Beach) where a variety of special events including beauty pageants, fishing tournaments, and boxing matches were held from the 1930s through 1950s. With a bar, tennis courts, bath houses, and a restaurant, it was a popular resort until it eventually closed in the 1960s. The entire island was initially owned by the federal government. In order to promote infrastructure and growth on the island, the federal government leased the lands now encompassing Pensacola Beach to the Santa Rosa Island Authority (SRIA), which in turn has leased the property to homeowners. As a result, all structures on the island have 99-year renewable leases with the SRIA rather than ownership of the land itself. Geography Pensacola Beach at sunset Pensacola Beach is located at , on the barrier island of Santa Rosa. It is bordered to the south by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Santa Rosa Sound and Pensacola Bay, and to the east and west by the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Architecture Pensacola Beach is home to some of the tallest buildings between Tallahassee and Mobile, Alabama. The list below ranks the buildings in height. # Portofino Towers (). # Beach Club (). # Santa Rosa Towers (). # Verandas Tower (). # Hilton Pensacola Beach Resort (). Climate While generally cooler than most of peninsular Florida, Pensacola Beach maintains a more stable temperature year round than inland areas of Pensacola and Escambia County. As such, winter lows are several degrees warmer than Pensacola proper and summer highs are generally cooler as a result of the surrounding waters. As with many islands, Pensacola Beach enjoys sea breezes which begin around noon and end around sunset in the summer. The average temperature ranges from in January to in July. Hurricanes As a community located on a low-lying barrier island, Pensacola Beach is vulnerable to hurricanes. Landfalling storms have been known to drive storm surge over the island, damaging or destroying man-made structures and causing beach erosion. In 1995, two hurricanes made landfall on the island. Hurricane Erin made landfall in August, and Hurricane Opal blasted the island just two months later, leveling some dunes and destroying a number of homes. On September 16, 2004, Hurricane Ivan devastated the Pensacola Beach area, destroying more than 650 homes and damaging many others. Ivan was the last hurricane to make Florida landfall in 2004, one of the most destructive hurricane seasons in decades. On July 10, 2005, Hurricane Dennis made landfall between Pensacola Beach and eastern Navarre Beach. However, as with Erin several years earlier, the damage on Pensacola Beach was not nearly as extensive as predicted. The island has been subject to mandatory evacuation orders during some of these hurricanes. Oil spill The Deepwater Horizon, a BP-operated oil-drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico off the Louisiana coast, exploded April 20, 2010, eventually releasing almost 5 million barrels of oil into the Gulf before being capped on August 4, 2010. Oil from the explosion did not reach Pensacola beaches until June 4, 2010. Crews posted along Escambia County's coastline quickly cleaned much of the oil that was evident along the beaches. Tourism in the Pensacola Beach area was adversely affected during the summer of 2010. Public transportation Escambia County Area Transit (ECAT) provides bus transportation seven days per week.
