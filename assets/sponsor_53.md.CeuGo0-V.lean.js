achievement in a course. Grades can be assigned as letters (for example, A through F), as a range (for example, 1 to 6), as a percentage, or as a number out of a possible total (for example, out of 100). In some countries, grades are averaged to create a grade point average (GPA). GPA is calculated by using the number of grade points a student earns in a given period of time.grade point average. (n.d.). WordNet2.0 Retrieved 3 October 2011, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/grade point average GPAs are often calculated for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, and can be used by potential employers or educational institutions to assess and compare applicants. A cumulative grade point average (CGPA), sometimes referred to as just GPA, is a measure of a student's performance for all of his or her courses. History Yale University historian George W. Pierson writes: \\"According to tradition the first grades issued at Yale (and possibly the first in the country) were given out in the year 1785, when President Ezra Stiles, after examining 58 Seniors, recorded in his diary that there were 'Twenty Optimi, sixteen second Optimi, twelve Inferiores (Boni), ten Pejores.'\\" Bob Marlin argues that the concept of grading students' work quantitatively was developed by a tutor named William Farish and first implemented by the University of Cambridge in 1792. That assertion has been questioned by Christopher Stray, who finds the evidence for Farish as the inventor of the numerical mark to be unpersuasive.Christopher Stray, \\"From Oral to Written Examinations: Cambridge, Oxford and Dublin 1700‚Äì1914\\", History of Universities 20:2 (2005), 94‚Äì95. Stray's article also explains the complex relationship between the mode of examination (oral or written) and the varying philosophies of education these modes imply to both the teacher and the student. As a technology, grading both shapes and reflects many fundamental areas of educational theory and practice. Grading systems by country Most nations have their own grading system, and different institutions in a single nation can vary in their grading systems as well. However, several international standards for grading have arisen recently, such as the European Baccalaureate. =England and Wales= In the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) exam taken by secondary school students in England and Wales, grades generally range from 9 (highest) to 1 (lowest). These replaced earlier A, B, C... grading. However, in GCSE Science, Mathematics Statistics, and any Modern Foreign Language, there are two tiers (higher and foundation). In the higher tier, grades 9 to 4 can be achieved, while in the foundation tier, only grades 5 to 1 can be awarded. The new 9‚Äì1 qualifications saw some more subjects such as English language and English literature go 'tierless,‚Äô with the same paper covering all levels of demand. Generally, a 4 or above would be considered a pass and a 3 or below would be considered a fail by most institutions: for Mathematics and English Language and English Literature, and possibly Science, this would require a resit. If a candidate does not score highly enough to get a grade 1, their results slip will have the letter U for \\"ungraded\\", meaning no grade was secured. Other letters such as X also exist in special circumstances. In Wales, the grading is still from A* (highest) to G (lowest) with U a fail. =United States= Most colleges and universities in the United States award a letter grade A (best), B, C, D, or F (fail) for each class taken (potentially with + or - modifiers). These letter grades are then used to calculate a GPA from 0 to 4.0 using a formula, where 4.0 is the best. The average GPA is 3.3 at private institutions and 3.0 at public institutions. Various colleges, such as Evergreen State College and Hampshire College, do not use traditional grades. Brown University, an Ivy League school, does not calculate grade point averages, and all classes can be taken on a pass/fail basis. Additionally, several high schools have decided to forgo grades. A notable example is Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn, which was ranked by the Wall Street Journal as the number one high school in the country for having the highest percentage of graduating seniors enroll in Ivy League and several other highly selective colleges.2 April 2004 Wall Street Journal, Cover Story (Personal Journal) GPA in the United States job market According to a study published in 2014, a one-point increase in high-school GPA translated to an 11.85% increase in annual earnings for men and 13.77% for women in the United States. College students often wonder how much weight GPA carries in their employment prospects. In many fields, work experience (such as internships) gained during one's time in college are the most important factors that employers consider. Other factors include choice of major, volunteering, choice of extracurricular activities, relevance of coursework, GPA, and the reputation of one's college. The relative importance of these factors do vary between professions, but for a graduate's first job out of college, GPA is often quite high on the list of factors that employers consider. There is also criticism about using grades as an indicator in employment. Armstrong (2012) claimed that the relationship between grades and job performance is low and becoming lower in recent studies. Grade inflation at American colleges over recent decades has also played a role in the devaluation of grades. =India= Different educational boards use different metrics in awarding grades to students, along with the marks obtained in most cases. Central Board of Secondary Education follows positional grading system where grades are given on basis of the position of the student, if the student is in top 1/8th ranks the grade is A1, next 1/8th A2, next 1/8th B1 and so on.. This grading system is based on relative position of student rather than the actual marks by the student, it compares marks of different students and then a grade is given. =Nepal= In Nepal, grading systems are of two types. In SEE Board, the grade point is calculated on the basis of range of marks obtained by students. For instance; Two students who score 86 and 89 respectively out of 100 full marks, then they are both included under A grade. While in NEB (National Examination Board), the grade points are awarded according to the actual marks obtained by the student but not according to range. For calculating GPA, the average of ranges of marks obtained is taken in SEE while, only average of marks is taken in NEB. This process is irreversible in case of SEE if someone wants to convert GPA to Percentage.

A *abstract ‚Äì a brief set of statements that summarize, classifies, evaluates, or describes the important points of a text, particularly a journal article. An abstract is typically found on the first page of a scholarly article. Because an abstract summarizes an article, it is very useful for either browsing or keyword searching. *annotation ‚Äì an explanatory or critical note or commentary. Annotation is also the process of adding an explanatory or critical note or commentary to a text. Reference lists are often annotated with comments about what each resource covered and how useful it was. *appendix ‚Äì a group of supplementary material appended to a text. It is usually related to the material in the main part of the text but not so closely related to it that it should be put into the main text. Put background information and supporting facts in the appendices. An example of a file that should be put in an appendix is a file of detailed charts and graphs of recent research closely related to the paper's main topic. *archive ‚Äì a place in which historical documents and other records are preserved. Usually operated by large organizations, they may or may not be open to the public. The University of Toronto, for example has an archive that requires a five-story building and contains several climate controlled vaults. A virtual archive is similar except the documents have no physical presence and seldom have historical value. *arrangement - the organization of entities in a certain order. *author ‚Äì an originator of a creative work, particularly a writer of a text. Searching by author can be an effective form of information gathering. *authority control ‚Äì a cataloging process in library management of assigning unique headings to subjects such as author names and book titles to enable greater efficiency in referencing. B *bibliography ‚Äì a list of writings related to a specific subject, writings by a specific author, or writings used in producing a specific text. *bibiographic database is a computer based list of library resources. Typically each record contains the call number, author, title, publishing information, and other card catalog information. *Boolean logic ‚Äì the algebraic system, developed by George Boole that is applied to Boolean expressions that contain Boolean operators such as AND, OR, NOT AND, and XOR (exclusive OR). This binary algebraic system is used primarily in switching circuits and database searches. Boolean operators are not to be confused with proximity operators such as NEAR. *browse ‚Äì to inspect something casually, particularly to use an internet browser to casually inspect Web pages. This involves following links from page to page (also called surfing) rather than searching directly. The main difference between browsing and searching is that with browsing you have very little advance knowledge of what will be on the next page. C *call number ‚Äì an identification marker used in libraries to categorize and locate books and other resources. Each resource is assigned a combination of letters and numbers which correspond with a location in the library. For example, the call number for the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association is BF76.7 .P83 2001. *catalog (or catalogue) ‚Äì a complete and systematically organized enumeration of items, particularly the complete enumeration of a libraries' resources on a set of paper cards (card catalog) or in an electronic database (bibliographic database). *categorization - grouping together like concepts, entities, objects, resources, etc. *citation ‚Äì the quoting or mentioning of a source. All works used in preparing a paper should be cited. *citation search ‚Äì a search, by name, of all references to an individual. Some databases have a specific citation search option, otherwise you use a full-text search. For an example of a database that has a specific citation search option go to the University of Michigan Library Database. *classification - the arrangement of subjects into certain categories. *Community analysis ‚Äì the analysis of a set of people. Such analyses enable librarians to know the needs of patrons and hopefully provide better services to them. In a city library district, the set of relevant people would be all those who live in the city or those people eligible to use the library. Analysis may also be restricted to a subset of eligible library users. *controlled vocabulary ‚Äì limiting searches to the exact subject headings contained in the Library of Congress. An example would be \\"History ‚Äì Bibliography etc\\". Some indexes, like Wilson Indexes, have their own system of headings and hence their own controlled vocabulary. *copyright ‚Äì the legal right granted to a copyright holder for the exclusive sale, distribution or reproduction of a creative work. It is a form of intellectual property that prevents others from using a creative work without consent of the owner. For example, Thomas Mann holds the copyright on the book The Oxford Guide to Library Research. *cross reference database ‚Äì a collection of records that have one or more fields that reference other related records. These connections (for example between \\"marketing\\" and \\"promotion\\") make browsing very productive and allow related-items searches. D *database - is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. *descriptor ‚Äì an index term used to identify a record in a database. It can consist of a word, phrase, or alphanumerical term. It can describe the content of the record or be an arbitrary code. When a descriptor is descriptive, it can be an effective search parameter. *Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) ‚Äì a hierarchical system for classifying books and other library materials by subject, first published in 1876 by the librarian and educator Melvil Dewey, who divided human knowledge into 10 main classes, each of which is divided into 10 divisions, etc. In Dewey Decimal call numbers, Arabic numerals and decimal fractions are used in the class notation (example: 996.9) and an alphanumeric book number is added to subarrange works of the same classification by author and by title and edition (996.9 B3262h). *dissertation ‚Äì a written treatise or thesis, usually lengthy, usually authored by a doctoral candidate, usually directed by a faculty advisor, and usually intended to advance the state of the art in a given discipline. There can be an oral component to the process, in which the dissertation must be defended in front of critical judges. Dissertation searches are valuable because of their currency. *document delivery ‚Äì the transfer of a database record, or other information resource, to the end user. It can involve direct internet or email transfers, CD delivery via mail, paper delivery via mail, or delivery via interlibrary loan. E *edition ‚Äì a version of a published text, or all the instances of a published text issued at a given time. An example would be the 2nd edition (2001). *entry ‚Äì any record, or a field in a record, that has been included, or entered, into a database. An entry word is the headword in a dictionary, encyclopedia, or glossary. *Enumeration ‚Äì is a complete, ordered listing of all the items in a collection. F *field ‚Äì an element of a database record. It contains one type of information and has a unique address. All or most other records in the database have a similar field. An example is the field \\"name\\". *finding aid - a description of an archival collection that describes the collection as a whole rather than individual pieces within the collection. *free-text search ‚Äì :1. is a simple word or character search, usually with very few Boolean, proximity, or scope limiting options. It is simple and fast. :2. a search in which all the entries are freed from their original format of presentation. Text that originated in a journal article looks much the same as text that originated in a glossary or chat room. :3. the deliberate limiting of the scope of the search parameters to include only records that are available free of charge. *full text database ‚Äì a collection of records containing complete versions of the original source, rather than just bibliographies, abstracts, or abridgements. An example is JSTOR. A related concept is that of a full text search which searches only sources that are complete, and ignores those records that are mere abstracts or descriptors. I *Information extraction - is the task of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured and/or semi-structured machine-readable documents. *Information literacy - is the set of integrated abilities encompassing the reflective discovery of information, the understanding of how information is produced and valued, and the use of information in creating new knowledge and participating ethically in communities of learning. *Information mapping - is a research-based method for writing clear and user focused information, based on the audience's needs and the purpose of the information. *Information science - is a field primarily concerned with the analysis, collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval, movement, dissemination, and protection of information. *interlibrary loan or interloan ‚Äì a service whereby a user of one library can borrow books or receive photocopies of documents that are owned by another library. The user makes a request with their local library, which, acting as an intermediary, identifies owners of the desired item, places the request, receives the item, makes it available to the user, and arranges for its return. This resource sharing system is being promoted by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA). *inventory - a tool used to provide a record of what is owned. J *journal ‚Äì a periodical publication that presents articles in a specific subject area. These may be academic journals, trade journals, or organizational newsletters. K *keyword search ‚Äì a search of a database using some keyword, a significant word from the title, abstract, or descriptor of a record as a point of reference to the article's overall content. L *literature search ‚Äì A systematic and thorough search of all material, print or electronic, published on a given topic. This can include books, journals, newspapers, catalogs, encyclopedias, dictionaries, atlases, bibliographies, handbooks, manuals, indexes, yearbooks, gazetteers, directories, chronologies, almanacs, and guides. *location device - a number or other designation system that is used to physically locate an item. M *MARC (Machine-Readable Cataloging) - a set standard of prescribed codes that allows a record to be \\"read\\" by a machine by identifying specific elements of a catalog record. MARC is used to share bibliographic data between libraries by transmitting the encoded metadata from one system to another, then displayed to the user in an identifiable form. *menu ‚Äì a list of options from which a computer user can choose. This saves the user from having to memorize a set of commands. It also reduces the decision down to the basic information required (note the etymology from the French word minuet meaning small). *monograph ‚Äì a written document on a single subject, usually scholarly in nature and of approximately book length. They are valuable information sources because of their depth in a limited subject area. O *OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) - a comprehensive bibliographic network that provides bibliographic, abstract, and full-text information to users. *operators ‚Äì symbols that represent operations. In computer science there are binary and unary operators depending on the number of elements or records an operator acts on. In database searching there are Boolean and Proximity operators. Boolean operators are a subclass of logical operators (Logical operators are binary operators that manipulate data at the bit level.). A Boolean operator manipulates the binary \\"true/false\\" value. *online catalog or electronic catalog ‚Äì a record of the holdings of an institution (e.g. library or museum) or group of institutions (a consortium), often searchable, that can be found on the Internet. *open access - a mechanism by which research outputs are distributed online, free of cost or other barriers,[1] and, in its most precise meaning, with the addition of an open license applied to promote reuse. *open source- in production and development a philosophy or methodology promoting free redistribution and access to an end product's design and implementation details. P *pathfinder - a subject bibliography used to find resources the library has available on a specific topic. *paywall - a method of restricting access to content via a paid subscription. *periodical index ‚Äì an alphabetized listing of works that are published at regular intervals of more than one day. *plagiarism ‚Äì the passing off as your own, the work of others'. Original sources are not given credit. *primary source ‚Äì the originator of a primary record. A primary record is a resource created by the same people that initially experienced or used it. They create the records for their own purposes, records that often remain unpublished. Sometimes they witness an event, sometimes they are involved in an event, and sometimes the record is directly created by the event. R *record ‚Äì an individual entry in a database and simultaneously a collection of related data fields. Each field, although related, is of a different type to all the other fields in the record (and this is what differentiates a record from an array). *Reference Service ‚Äì the personal assistance provided to the library users in finding information. All the functions performed by a trained librarian employed in the reference section of a library to meet the information needs of patrons (in person, by telephone, or electronically), including but not limited to answering substantive questions, instructing users in the selection and use of appropriate tools and techniques for finding information, conducting searches on behalf of the patron, directing users to the location of library resources, assisting in the evaluation of information, referring patrons to resources outside the library when appropriate, etc. are regarded as the services provided under library reference services. *review article ‚Äì a periodical article that describes, analyses', and criticizes a book, journal article, movie, or other creative or academic work. S *scholarly article ‚Äì an article, usually in a scholarly journal, that deals with academic subject matter at an advanced level. *search strategy ‚Äì a generalized set of technique used in the process of determining what information you currently have, determining what information you need, and determining how to get it. Some possible strategies include; controlled vocabulary searches, specific entry searches, browsing, general scanning, broad to narrow searches, adjacent item browsing, subject tracings searches, keyword searches, citation searches, literature searches, cross reference searches, and chat room questions and other direct people contact searches. *subject heading ‚Äì the name of the category that a record is included under. For example, the record \\"natural frequency of vibration\\" might be found under the subject heading of \\"Acoustics\\", and acoustics, in turn, might be found under the subject heading \\"Physics\\". *subject directory ‚Äì an hierarchical grouping of related subject headings. The tree structure shows relationships between subject headings. They can be found either inside a database or separate from a data base. T *thesaurus ‚Äì a book of synonyms, often also containing antonyms. An example is Roget's Thesaurus. In database searching, a thesaurus strategy is to use multiple iterations to search for related words and generate results. The database will often suggest synonyms and related words to try. *truncation ‚Äì the shortening of a search word, field, or record. In the case of truncating a search word, this is a strategy used to search among multiple variants or spellings of a word. The asterisk (*) is generally used as a wildcard to replace a letter or letters. An example is invest* which will pick up instances of invest, investor, investments, investigations, etc. In some databases the asterisk must be accompanied with a number that define the number of characters that can be truncated.

Welfare is a type of government support intended to ensure that members of a society can meet basic human needs such as food and shelter. Social security may either be synonymous with welfare, or refer specifically to social insurance programs, which provide support only to those who have previously contributed (e.g. most pension systems), as opposed to social assistance programs, which provide support on the basis of need alone (e.g. most disability benefits). The International Labour Organization defines social security as covering support for those in old age, support for the maintenance of children, medical treatment, parental and sick leave, unemployment and disability benefits, and support for sufferers of occupational injury. More broadly, welfare may also encompass efforts to provide a basic level of well-being through free or subsidized social services such as healthcare, education, vocational training and public housing.The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought Third Edition (1999), Allan Bullock and Stephen Trombley Eds., p. 919. In a welfare state, the State assumes responsibility for the health, education, and welfare of society, providing a range of social services such as those described. The first welfare state was Imperial Germany (1871‚Äì1918), where the Bismarck government introduced social security in 1889. In the early 20th century, the United Kingdom introduced social security around 1913, and adopted the welfare state with the National Insurance Act 1946, during the Attlee government (1945‚Äì51). In the countries of western Europe, Scandinavia, and Australasia, social welfare is mainly provided by the government out of the national tax revenues, and to a lesser extent by non-government organizations (NGOs), and charities (social and religious). A right to social security and an adequate standard of living is asserted in Articles 22 and 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. History Distributing alms to the poor, abbey of Port-Royal des Champs c. 1710. In the Roman Empire, the first emperor Augustus provided the Cura Annonae or grain dole for citizens who could not afford to buy food every month. Social welfare was enlarged by the Emperor Trajan. Trajan's program brought acclaim from many, including Pliny the Younger. The Song dynasty government (960 CE) supported multiple programs which could be classified as social welfare, including the establishment of retirement homes, public clinics, and paupers' graveyards. According to economist Robert Henry Nelson, \\"The medieval Roman Catholic Church operated a far-reaching and comprehensive welfare system for the poor...\\"Robert Henry Nelson (2001). \\"Economics as religi√≥n: from Samuelson to Chicago and beyond\\". Penn State Press. p. 103. \\"Chapter1: Charity and Welfare\\", the American Academy of Research Historians of Medieval Spain. In the Islamic world, Zakat (charity), one of the Five Pillars of Islam, have been collected by the government since the time of the Rashidun caliph Umar in the 7th century, and used to provide income for the needy, including the poor, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled. According to the Islamic jurist Al-Ghazali (Algazel, 1058‚Äì111), the government was also expected to store up food supplies in every region in case a disaster or famine occurred.) (See Bayt al-mal for further information.) Likewise, in Jewish tradition, charity (represented by tzedakah) is a matter of religious obligation rather than benevolence. Contemporary charity is regarded as a continuation of the Biblical Maaser Ani, or poor-tithe, as well as Biblical practices, such as permitting the poor to glean the corners of a field and harvest during the Shmita (Sabbatical year). There is relatively little statistical data on transfer payments before the High Middle Ages. In the medieval period and until the Industrial Revolution, the function of welfare payments in Europe was achieved through private giving or charity, through numerous confraternities and activities of different religious orders. Early welfare programs in Europe included the English Poor Law of 1601, which gave parishes the responsibility for providing welfare payments to the poor.The Poor Laws of England at EH.Net This system was substantially modified by the 19th-century Poor Law Amendment Act, which introduced the system of workhouses. It was predominantly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that an organized system of state welfare provision was introduced in many countries. Otto von Bismarck, Chancellor of Germany, introduced one of the first welfare systems for the working classes. In Great Britain the Liberal government of Henry Campbell-Bannerman and David Lloyd George introduced the National Insurance system in 1911,Liberal Reforms at BBC Bitesize a system later expanded by Clement Attlee. Modern welfare states include Germany, France, the Netherlands,Shorto, Russell (April 29, 2009). Going Dutch. The New York Times (magazine).

Edwards and Tony Elger, The global economy, national states and the regulation of labour (1999) p. 111 which employ a system known as the Nordic model. Esping-Andersen classified the most developed welfare state systems into three categories; Social Democratic, Conservative, and Liberal. A report published by the ILO in 2014 estimated that only 27% of the world's population has access to comprehensive social security. The World Bank's 2019 World Development Report argues that the traditional payroll-based model of many kinds of social insurance are \\"increasingly challenged by working arrangements outside standard employment contracts.\\"World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work. Chapter 6 Forms Welfare can take a variety of forms, such as monetary payments, subsidies and vouchers, or housing assistance. Welfare systems differ from country to country, but welfare is commonly provided to individuals who are unemployed, those with illness or disability, the elderly, those with dependent children, and veterans. Programs may have a variety of conditions for a person to receive welfare: * Social insurance, discussed previously * Means-tested benefits, financial assistance provided for those who are unable to cover basic needs, such as food, clothing and housing, due to poverty or lack of income because of unemployment, sickness, disability, or caring for children. While assistance is often in the form of financial payments, those eligible for social welfare can usually access health and educational services free of charge. The amount of support is enough to cover basic needs and eligibility is often subject to a comprehensive and complex assessment of an applicant's social and financial situation. See also Income Support. * Non-contributory benefits. Several countries have special schemes, administered with no requirement for contributions and no means test, for people in certain categories of need: for example, veterans of armed forces, people with disabilities and very old people. * Discretionary benefits. Some schemes are based on the discretion of an official, such as a social worker. * Universal or categorical benefits, also known as demogrants. These are non-contributory benefits given for whole sections of the population without a means test, such as family allowances or the public pension in New Zealand (known as New Zealand Superannuation). See also the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend. =Social protection= In developing countries, formal social security arrangements are often absent for the vast majority of the working population, in part due to reliance on the informal economy. Additionally, the state's capacity to reach people may be limited because of its limited infrastructure and resources. In this context, social protection is often referred to instead of social security, encompassing a broader set of means, such as labour market intervention and local community-based programs, to alleviate poverty and provide security against things like unemployment.Mendoza, Roger Lee (1990). The political economy of population control and retirement security in China, India and the Philippines. Philippine Economic Review, 31(2): 174‚Äì191. By country =Australia= Prior to 1900 in Australia, charitable assistance from benevolent societies, sometimes with financial contributions from the authorities, was the primary means of relief for people not able to support themselves. The 1890s economic depression and the rise of the trade unions and the Labor parties during this period led to a movement for welfare reform. In 1900, the states of New South Wales and Victoria enacted legislation introducing non-contributory pensions for those aged 65 and over. Queensland legislated a similar system in 1907 before the Australian labor Commonwealth government led by Andrew Fisher introduced a national aged pension under the Invalid and Old-Aged Pensions Act 1908. A national invalid disability pension was started in 1910, and a national maternity allowance was introduced in 1912. During the Second World War, Australia under a labor government created a welfare state by enacting national schemes for: child endowment in 1941 (superseding the 1927 New South Wales scheme); a widows‚Äô pension in 1942 (superseding the New South Wales 1926 scheme); a wife's allowance in 1943; additional allowances for the children of pensioners in 1943; and unemployment, sickness, and special benefits in 1945 (superseding the Queensland 1923 scheme). =Canada= Canada has a welfare state in the European tradition; however, it is not referred to as \\"welfare\\", but rather as \\"social programs\\". In Canada, \\"welfare\\" usually refers specifically to direct payments to poor individuals (as in the American usage) and not to healthcare and education spending (as in the European usage). The Canadian social safety net covers a broad spectrum of programs, and because Canada is a federation, many are run by the provinces. Canada has a wide range of government transfer payments to individuals, which totaled $145 billion in 2006. Only social programs that direct funds to individuals are included in that cost; programs such as medicare and public education are additional costs. Generally speaking, before the Great Depression, most social services were provided by religious charities and other private groups. Changing government policy between the 1930s and 1960s saw the emergence of a welfare state, similar to many Western European countries. Most programs from that era are still in use, although many were scaled back during the 1990s as government priorities shifted towards reducing debt and deficits. =Denmark= Danish welfare is handled by the state through a series of policies (and the like) that seeks to provide welfare services to citizens, hence the term welfare state. This refers not only to social benefits, but also tax-funded education, public child care, medical care, etc. A number of these services are not provided by the state directly, but administered by municipalities, regions or private providers through outsourcing. This sometimes gives a source of tension between the state and municipalities, as there is not always consistency between the promises of welfare provided by the state (i.e. parliament) and local perception of what it would cost to fulfill these promises. =Finland= =India= The Central Government of India's social programmes and welfare expenditures are a substantial portion of the official budget, and state and local governments play roles in developing and implementing social security policies. Additional welfare measure systems are also uniquely operated by various state governments. The government uses the unique identity number (Aadhar) that every Indian possesses to distribute welfare measures in India. As of 2020, the government's expenditure on social programme and welfare (direct cash transfers, financial inclusion, benefits, health and other insurances, subsidies, free school meals, rural employment guarantee), was approximately 14 lakh crore rupees ($ 192 billion), which was 7.3 % of gross domestic product (GDP). =France= Solidarity is a strong value of the French Social Protection system. The first article of the French Code of Social Security describes the principle of solidarity. Solidarity is commonly comprehended in relations of similar work, shared responsibility and common risks. Existing solidarities in France caused the expansion of health and social security.Samuel L√©z√©, \\"France\\", in: Andrew Scull (ed.), Cultural Sociology of Mental Illness : an A-to-Z Guide, Sage, 2014, pp. 316‚Äì17Allan Mitchell, A Divided Path: The German Influence on Social Reform in France After 1870 (1991)Paul V. Dutton, Origins of the French welfare state: The struggle for social reform in France, 1914‚Äì1947. (Cambridge UP, 2002). online =Germany= The welfare state has a long tradition in Germany dating back to the industrial revolution. Due to the pressure of the workers' movement in the late 19th century, Reichskanzler Otto von Bismarck introduced the first rudimentary state social insurance scheme. Under Adolf Hitler, the National Socialist Program stated \\"We demand an expansion on a large scale of old age welfare\\". Today, the social protection of all its citizens is considered a central pillar of German national policy. 27.6 percent of Germany's GDP is channeled into an all-embracing system of health, pension, accident, longterm care and unemployment insurance, compared to 16.2 percent in the US. In addition, there are tax-financed services such as child benefits (Kindergeld, beginning at ‚Ç¨192 per month for the first and second child, ‚Ç¨198 for the third and ‚Ç¨223 for each child thereafter, until they attain 25 years or receive their first professional qualification), and basic provisions for those unable to work or anyone with an income below the poverty line. Since 2005, reception of full unemployment pay (60‚Äì67% of the previous net salary) has been restricted to 12 months in general and 18 months for those over 55. This is now followed by (usually much lower) Arbeitslosengeld II (ALG II) or Sozialhilfe, which is independent of previous employment (Hartz IV concept). Under ALG II, a single person receives ‚Ç¨391 per month plus the cost of 'adequate' housing and health insurance. ALG II can also be paid partially to supplement a low work income. =Italy= The Italian welfare state's foundations were laid along the lines of the corporatist-conservative model, or of its Mediterranean variant. Later, in the 1960s and 1970s, increases in public spending and a major focus on universality brought it on the same path as social-democratic systems. In 1978, a universalistic welfare model was introduced in Italy, offering a number of universal and free services such as a National Health Fund. =Japan= Social welfare, assistance for the ill or otherwise disabled and for the old, has long been provided in Japan by both the government and private companies. Beginning in the 1920s, the government enacted a series of welfare programs, based mainly on European models, to provide medical care and financial support. During the postwar period, a comprehensive system of social security was gradually established. =Latin America= History The 1980s marked a change in the structure of Latin American social protection programs. Social protection embraces three major areas: social insurance, financed by workers and employers; social assistance to the population's poorest, financed by the state; and labor market regulations to protect worker rights.Barrientos, A. and Claudio Santibanez. (2009). \\"New Forms of Social, Assistance and the Evolution of Social Protection in Latin America\\". Journal of Latin American Studies. Cambridge University Press 41, 1‚Äì26 Although diverse, recent Latin American social policy has tended to concentrate on social assistance. The 1980s had a significant effect on social protection policies. Prior to the 1980s, most Latin American countries focused on social insurance policies involving formal sector workers, assuming that the informal sector would disappear with economic development. The economic crisis of the 1980s and the liberalization of the labor market led to a growing informal sector and a rapid increase in poverty and inequality. Latin American countries did not have the institutions and funds to properly handle such a crisis, both due to the structure of the social security system, and to the previously implemented structural adjustment policies (SAPs) that had decreased the size of the state. New Welfare programs have integrated the multidimensional, social risk management, and capabilities approaches into poverty alleviation. They focus on income transfers and service provisions while aiming to alleviate both long- and short-term poverty through, among other things, education, health, security, and housing. Unlike previous programs that targeted the working class, new programs have successfully focused on locating and targeting the very poorest. The impacts of social assistance programs vary between countries, and many programs have yet to be fully evaluated. According to Barrientos and Santibanez, the programs have been more successful in increasing investment in human capital than in bringing households above the poverty line. Challenges still exist, including the extreme inequality levels and the mass scale of poverty; locating a financial basis for programs; and deciding on exit strategies or on the long-term establishment of programs. 1980s impacts The economic crisis of the 1980s led to a shift in social policies, as understandings of poverty and social programs evolved (24). New, mostly short-term programs emerged. These include: * Argentina: Jefes y Jefas de Hogar, Asignaci√≥n Universal por Hijo * Bolivia: Bonosol * Brazil: Bolsa Escola and Bolsa Familia * Chile: Chile Solidario * Colombia: Solidaridad por Colombia * Ecuador: Bono de Desarrollo Humano * Honduras: Red Solidaria * Mexico: Prospera (earlier known as Oportunidades) * Panama: Red de Oportunidades * Peru: Juntos Major aspects of current social assistance programs * Conditional cash transfer (CCT) combined with service provisions. Transfer cash directly to households, most often through the women of the household, if certain conditions are met (e.g. children's school attendance or doctor visits) (10). Providing free schooling or healthcare is often not sufficient, because there is an opportunity cost for the parents in, for example, sending children to school (lost labor power), or in paying for the transportation costs of getting to a health clinic. * Household. The household has been the focal point of social assistance programs. * Target the poorest. Recent programs have been more successful than past ones in targeting the poorest. Previous programs often targeted the working class. * Multidimensional. Programs have attempted to address many dimensions of poverty at once. Chile Solidario is the best example. =New Zealand= New Zealand is often regarded as having one of the first comprehensive welfare systems in the world. During the 1890s a Liberal government adopted many social programmes to help the poor who had suffered from a long economic depression in the 1880s. One of the most far reaching was the passing of tax legislation that made it difficult for wealthy sheep farmers to hold onto their large land holdings. This and the invention of refrigeration led to a farming revolution where many sheep farms were broken up and sold to become smaller dairy farms. This enabled thousands of new farmers to buy land and develop a new and vigorous industry that has become the backbone of New Zealand's economy to this day. This liberal tradition flourished with increased enfranchisement for indigenous Maori in the 1880s and women. Pensions for the elderly, the poor and war casualties followed, with State-run schools, hospitals and subsidized medical and dental care. By 1960 New Zealand was able to afford one of the best-developed and most comprehensive welfare systems in the world, supported by a well-developed and stable economy. =Philippines= =Poland= =South Africa= =Spain= =Sub-Saharan Africa= =Sweden= Social welfare in Sweden is made up of several organizations and systems dealing with welfare. It is mostly funded by taxes, and executed by the public sector on all levels of government as well as private organizations. It can be separated into three parts falling under three different ministries; social welfare, falling under the responsibility of Ministry of Health and Social Affairs; education, under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and Research and labor market, under the responsibility of Ministry of Employment. Government pension payments are financed through an 18.5% pension tax on all taxed incomes in the country, which comes partly from a tax category called a public pension fee (7% on gross income), and 30% of a tax category called employer fees on salaries (which is 33% on a netted income). Since January 2001 the 18.5% is divided in two parts: 16% goes to current payments, and 2.5% goes into individual retirement accounts, which were introduced in 2001. Money saved and invested in government funds, and IRAs for future pension costs, are roughly 5 times annual government pension expenses (725/150). =United Kingdom= ;UK Government welfare expenditure 2011‚Äì12: * State pension (46.32%) * Housing Benefit (10.55%) * Disability Living Allowance (7.87%) * Pension Credit (5.06%) * Income Support (4.31%) * Rent rebates (3.43%) * Attendance Allowance (3.31%) * Jobseeker's Allowance (3.06%) * Incapacity Benefit (3.06%) * Council Tax Benefit (3%) * Other (10.03%) The United Kingdom has a long history of welfare, notably including the English Poor laws which date back to 1536. After various reforms to the program, which involved workhouses, it was eventually abolished and replaced with a modern system by laws such as National Assistance Act 1948. In more recent times, comparing the Cameron‚ÄìClegg coalition's austerity measures with the Opposition's, the Financial Times commentator Martin Wolf commented that the \\"big shift from Labour ... is the cuts in welfare benefits.\\" The government's austerity programme, which involves reduction in government policy, has been linked to a rise in food banks. A study published in the British Medical Journal in 2015 found that each 1 percentage point increase in the rate of Jobseeker's Allowance claimants sanctioned was associated with a 0.09 percentage point rise in food bank use. The austerity programme has faced opposition from disability rights groups for disproportionately affecting disabled people. The \\"bedroom tax\\" is an austerity measure that has attracted particular criticism, with activists arguing that two-thirds of council houses affected by the policy are occupied with a person with a disability. =United States= Roosevelt signs the Social Security Act, August 14, 1935. Welfare in America In the United States, depending on the context, the term \\"welfare\\" can be used to refer to means-tested cash benefits, especially the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program and its successor, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Block Grant, or it can be used to refer to all means-tested programs that help individuals or families meet basic needs, including, for example, health care through Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits and food and nutrition programs (SNAP). It can also include Social Insurance programs such as Unemployment Insurance, Social Security, and Medicare. AFDC (originally called Aid to Dependent Children) was created during the Great Depression to alleviate the burden of poverty for families with children and allow widowed mothers to maintain their households. The New Deal employment program such as the Works Progress Administration primarily served men. Prior to the New Deal, anti-poverty programs were primarily operated by private charities or state or local governments; however, these programs were overwhelmed by the depth of need during the Depression. The United States has no national program of cash assistance for non-disabled poor individuals who are not raising children. Until early in the year of 1965, the news media was conveying only whites as living in poverty however that perception had changed to blacks. Some of the influences in this shift could have been the civil rights movement and urban riots from the mid 60s. Welfare had then shifted from being a White issue to a Black issue and during this time frame the war on poverty had already begun. Subsequently, news media portrayed stereotypes of Blacks as lazy, undeserving and welfare queens. These shifts in media don't necessarily establish the population living in poverty decreasing. A chart showing the overall decline of average monthly welfare benefits (AFDC then TANF) per recipient 1962‚Äì2006 (in 2006 dollars). In 1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act changed the structure of Welfare payments and added new criteria to states that received Welfare funding. After reforms, which President Clinton said would \\"end Welfare as we know it\\", amounts from the federal government were given out in a flat rate per state based on population. Each state must meet certain criteria to ensure recipients are being encouraged to work themselves out of Welfare. The new program is called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).\\"Characteristics and Financial Circumstances of TANF Recipients ‚Äì Fiscal Year 2010\\". United States Department of Health and Human Services. It encourages states to require some sort of employment search in exchange for providing funds to individuals, and imposes a five-year lifetime limit on cash assistance. In FY 2010, 31.8% of TANF families were white, 31.9% were African- American, and 30.0% were Hispanic. According to the U.S. Census Bureau data released September 13, 2011, the nation's poverty rate rose to 15.1% (46.2 million) in 2010,\\"Revised govt formula shows new poverty high: 49.1M\\". Yahoo! News. November 7, 2011 up from 14.3% (approximately 43.6 million) in 2009 and to its highest level since 1993. In 2008, 13.2% (39.8 million) Americans lived in relative poverty.\\"Poverty rate hits 15-year high\\". Reuters. September 17, 2010 In a 2011 op-ed in Forbes, Peter Ferrara stated that, \\"The best estimate of the cost of the 185 federal means tested Welfare programs for 2010 for the federal government alone is nearly $700 billion, up a third since 2008, according to the Heritage Foundation. Counting state spending, total Welfare spending for 2010 reached nearly $900 billion, up nearly one-fourth since 2008 (24.3%)\\". California, with 12% of the U.S. population, has one-third of the nation's welfare recipients.\\"California lawmakers again waging political warfare over welfare\\". Los Angeles Times. June 24, 2012 In FY 2011, federal spending on means-tested welfare, plus state contributions to federal programs, reached $927 billion per year. Roughly half of this welfare assistance ‚Äì or $462 billion ‚Äì went to families with children, most of which are headed by single parents. The United States has also typically relied on charitable giving through non-profit agencies and fundraising instead of direct monetary assistance from the government itself. According to Giving USA, Americans gave $358.38 billion to charity in 2014. This is rewarded by the United States government through tax incentives for individuals and companies that are not typically seen in other countries. Impact The welfare-to-work intervention programme is unlikely to have any impacts on the mental and physical health of lone parents and children. Even when the employment and income rates were higher in this group of people, the poverty rate was high which could lead to persistently high rates of depression whether they were in the programme or not. Income transfers can be either conditional or unconditional. Conditionalities are sometimes criticized as being paternalistic and unnecessary. Some opponents of welfare argue that it affects work incentives. =Perception= According to a 2012 review study, whether a welfare program generates public support depends on: * whether the program is universal or targeted towards certain groups * the size of the social program benefits (larger benefits incentivize greater mobilization to defend a social program) * the visibility and traceability of the benefits (whether recipients know where the benefits come from) * the proximity and concentration of the beneficiaries (this affects the ease by which beneficiaries can organize to protect a social program) * the duration of the benefits (longer benefits incentivize greater mobilization to defend a social program) * the manner in which a program is administered (e.g. is the program inclusive, does it follow principles?)

The main kinds of fruit used for German schnapps are apples, pears, plums, cherries, and apricots. Fruits other than these five are rarely used. Apples are used along with pears to make Obstwasser (fruit water); pears are used to produce Poire Williams (Williamsbirne, William's pear); several types of plums make ' (plum water); cherries make Kirschwasser (cherry water); and apricots are used to make Austrian Marillenschnaps (apricot brandy). The different kinds of Obstler are similar to the varieties of Rakija found in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. Slivovitz is a popular schnapps made from Damson plums found throughout the region. The most popular schnapps in the UK is Peach Schnapps. It can be enjoyed in many ways, most prefer it on the rocks or mixed with other drinks to form a variety of cocktails. It is made by adding peach flavouring to a neutral grain spirit. It is typically clear and has a strong sweet taste. It became popular in the UK in the 1970's and 1980's. The leading brand is Archers but some large supermarkets do have their own branded peach schnapps which is sold at a reduced price. Archers peach schnapps is more similar to the American style of schnapps. =Neutral Spirit= Many liqueurs referred to as schnapps, but distinct from Obstler, are created by addition of herbal or fruit flavors to a neutral spirit by various methods. The neutral spirit used can vary by location and tradition. Kr√§uterlik√∂r (herbal liqueur) is similar to Italian Amaro (liqueur). Well known brands include J√§germeister, Underberg, Kuemmerling, Killepitsch and Wurzelpeter. Himbeergeist (raspberry spirit) is an infusion of macerated fresh berries in neutral spirits,Die Schnapsbrenner Detailed description of the method of production, in German.Fachlexikon General information about the production of Schnaps, including Himbeergeist, in German. which have been steeped for several weeks before being distilled.

Referred to as \\"schnapps\\", these are bottled with an alcohol content typically between 15% and 20% ABV (30‚Äì40 proof), though some may be much higher. Schnapps, specifically peach schnapps exploded in popularity in America in the 1980's.

The family Lepisosteidae includes seven living species of fish in two genera that inhabit fresh, brackish, and occasionally marine, waters of eastern North America, Central America and the Caribbean islands.Sterba, G: Freshwater Fishes of the World, p. 609, Vista Books, 1962 Gars have elongated bodies that are heavily armored with ganoid scales, and fronted by similarly elongated jaws filled with long, sharp teeth. Gars are sometimes referred to as \\"garpike\\", but are not closely related to pike, which are in the fish family Esocidae. All of the gars are relatively large fish, but the alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula) is the largest ‚Äì the alligator gar often grows to a length of over and a weight of over , and specimens of up to in length have been reported. Unusually, their vascularised swim bladders can function as lungs, and most gars surface periodically to take a gulp of air. Gar flesh is edible and the hard skin and scales of gars are used by humans, but gar eggs are highly toxic. Etymology The name gar was originally used for a species of needlefish (Belone belone) found in the North Atlantic and likely took its name from the Old English word for \\"spear\\". Belone belone is now more commonly referred to as the \\"garfish\\" or \\"gar fish\\" to avoid confusion with the North American gars of the family Lepisosteidae. Confusingly, the name \\"garfish\\" is also commonly used for a number of other species of the related genera Strongylura, Tylosurus and Xenentodon of the family Belonidae. The genus name Lepisosteus comes from the Greek lepis meaning \\"scale\\" and osteon meaning \\"bone\\". Atractosteus is similarly derived from Greek, in this case from atraktos, meaning arrow. Distribution Fossilized gars have been found in Europe, India, South America, and North America, indicating that in times past, these fish had a wider distribution than they do today. Gars are considered to be a remnant of a group of bony fish that flourished in the Mesozoic, and are most closely related to the bowfin. The distribution of the gar Lepisosteidae in North America lies mainly in the shallow, brackish waters off of Texas, Louisiana, and the eastern coast of Mexico, as well as in some of the rivers and lakes that flow to them. A few populations are also present in the Great Lakes region of the United States, living in similar shallow waters. Anatomy Large gar in an aquarium =Scales= Atractosteus fossil Gar bodies are elongated, heavily armored with ganoid scales, and fronted by similarly elongated jaws filled with long, sharp teeth. Their tails are heterocercal, and the dorsal fins are close to the tail. =Swim bladder= As their vascularised swim bladders can function as lungs, most gars surface periodically to take a gulp of air, doing so more frequently in stagnant or warm water when the concentration of oxygen in the water is low. Experiments on the swim bladder has shown that the temperature of the water affects which respiration method the gar will use: aerial or aquatic. They will increase the aerial breathing rate (breathing air) as temperature of the water is increased. Gars can live completely submerged in oxygenated water without access to air and remain healthy while also being able to survive in deoxygenated water if allowed access to air. This adaptation can be the result of environmental pressures and behavioral factors. As a result of this organ, they are extremely resilient and able to tolerate conditions that most other fish could not survive. =Pectoral girdle= Medial and lateral view of Lepisosteidae pectoral girdle The gar has paired pectoral fins and pelvic fins, as well as an anal fin, a caudal fin, and a dorsal fin. The bone structures within the fins are important to study as they can show homology throughout the fossil record. Specifically, the pelvic girdle resembles that of other actinopterygians while still having some of its own characteristics. Gars have a postcleithrun - which is a bone that is lateral to the scapula, but do not have postpectorals. Proximally to the postcleithrum, the supracleithrum is important as it plays a critical role in opening the gar's jaws. This structure has a unique internal coracoid lamina only present in the Gar species. Near the supracleithrum is the posttemporal bone, which is significantly smaller than other actinopterygians. Gars also have no clavicle bone, although there have been observations of elongated plates within the area. =Morphology= Fin chart for shortnose gar All the gars are relatively large fish, but the alligator gar Atractosteus spatula is the largest. The largest alligator gar ever caught and officially recorded was long, weighed , and was around the girth. Even the smaller species, such as Lepisosteus oculatus, are large, commonly reaching lengths of over , and sometimes much longer.Kodera H. et al.: Jurassic Fishes. TFH, 1994, Ecology A range map of Lepisosteiformes. Gars tend to be slow-moving fish except when striking at their prey. They prefer the shallow and weedy areas of rivers, lakes, and bayous, often congregating in small groups. They are voracious predators, catching their prey in their needle-like teeth with a sideways strike of the head. They feed extensively on smaller fish and invertebrates such as crabs. Gars are found across much of the eastern portion of North America. Although gars are found primarily in freshwater habitats, several species enter brackish waters and a few, most notably Atractosteus tristoechus, are sometimes found in the sea. Some gars travel from lakes and rivers through sewers to get to ponds.Monks N. (editor): Brackish Water Fishes, pp 322‚Äì324. TFH 2006, Species and Identification The gar family contains seven extant species, in two genera: Family Lepisosteidae * Genus Atractosteus Rafinesque, 1820 ** ‚Ä†Atractosteus africanus (Arambourg & Joleaud, 1943) ** Atractosteus spatula (Lac√©p√®de, 1803) (alligator gar) ** Atractosteus tristoechus (Bloch & J. G. Schneider, 1801) (Cuban gar) ** Atractosteus tropicus Gill, 1863 (tropical gar) * Genus Lepisosteus Linnaeus, 1758 ** ‚Ä†Lepisosteus bemisi Grande, 2010 ** ‚Ä†Lepisosteus cominatoi Santos, 1984 ** ‚Ä†Lepisosteus fimbriatus (Wood 1846) ** ‚Ä†Lepisosteus indicus (Woodward, 1908) ** Lepisosteus oculatus Winchell, 1864 (Spotted gar) ** ‚Ä†Lepisosteus opertus Estes, 1964 ** Lepisosteus osseus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Longnose gar) ** Lepisosteus platostomus Rafinesque, 1820 (Shortnose gar) ** Lepisosteus platyrhincus DeKay, 1842 (Florida gar) = Alligator gar = Alligator Gar (Atractosteus spatula) The largest member of the gar family, the alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula), can measure up to 10 feet long and weigh over 300 pounds. Its body and snout are wide and stocky, and it was named \\"alligator gar\\" because locals often mistook it for an alligator. The species can be found in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, the Mississippi River, Ohio, the Missouri river, and the southern drainages into Mexico. Its habitat consists of lakes and bays with slow currents. The gars grow rapidly when young and continue to grow at a slower rate after reaching adulthood. They are deep green or yellow in color. Recreational fishing of the alligator gar became popular due to its massive size and its meat is sold for food. Over five decades of overfishing have brought it close to extinction, and man-made dams have contributed to this loss by restricting the gar's access to the flood plain areas in which it spawns. Some U.S. states have enacted laws to combat overfishing, and reintroduction programs are being carried out in some states, such as Illinois, where human activity has driven the gar to extinction. Before being released, each gar must meet a length requirement to ensure that it has the best chance of survival in the wild. Some states, such as Texas, restrict the number of gar that may be caught in a day, the season in which they may be caught, and the equipment anglers may use to catch them. Some states also impose a minimum length requirement to prevent gar from being caught at too early an age. Scientists have found that the alligator gar can help maintain ecosystem balance by eating invasive species such as the Asian carp, and their success in a particular area can show scientists that area may also make a suitable habitat for other migratory species. = Florida gar = Lepisosteus platyrhincus The Florida gar (Lepisosteus platyrhincus) can be found in the Ocklockonee river, Florida, and Georgia, and prefers muddy or sandy bottoms with bountiful vegetation. It is commonly confused with its cousin, the spotted gar. Uneven black spots cover its head, body, and fins. Green-brown scales run along the back of its body, and the scales on its underbelly are white or yellow. This coloration, which blends well with the gar's surroundings, allows it to ambush its prey. The Florida gar has no ganoid scales on its throat. Female Florida gars grow to lengths between 13 and 34 inches, bigger than their male counterparts. = Spotted gar = Spotted Gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) The spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) is a smaller species of gar, measuring just under four feet long and weighing 15 pounds on average. Like Florida gars, female spotted gars are typically larger than male spotted gars. This gar has dark spots covering its head, body, and fins. Its body is compact, and it has a shorter snout. It prefers to live in clearer shallow water with a depth of 3‚Äì5 meters, and to surround itself in foliage. Its habitat ranges from the waters of Lake Michigan, the Lake Erie Basin, the Mississippi River System, and river drainages along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico from the Nueces River in Texas east to the lower Apalachicola River in Florida. It shares its habitat with the alligator gar, its main predator. These smaller gar live an average of 18 years. = Shortnose gar = Shortnose gar (Lepisosteus platostomus) The shortnose gar (Lepisosteus platostomus) is found in the Mississippi River Basin, Indiana, Wisconsin, Montana, Alabama, and Louisiana. It prefers to live in lakes, swamps, and calm pools. The shortnose gar takes its name from its snout, which is shorter and broader than that of other gar species. Like the longnose gar, it has one row of teeth. The upper jaw is longer than the rest of its head. The shortnose gar is deep green or brown in color, similar to the alligator gar. Depending on the clarity of water, spots can be present on the caudal, dorsal, and anal fins. The shortnose gar has a lifespan of 20 years, reaches up to 5 pounds in weight, and grows to lengths of 24-35 inches. It consumes more invertebrates than any other gar, and their stomachs have been found to contain higher Asian carp content than any other native North American fish. = Longnose gar = Longnose Gar (Lepisosteus osseus) The Longnose gar (Lepisosteus osseus) has a longer, narrower, more cylindrical body, and can be distinguished from other species of gar by its snout, which is more than twice the length of the rest of its head. It can reach up to 6 feet and 8 inches in length and weigh up to 35-80 pounds. Like the shortnose gar, it has only a single row of teeth. Unlike its relatives, it enters brackish water from time to time. Females are larger and live longer than the male longnose gar. Females living 22 years, and males about half as long. There are spots on the head, dorsal, anal, and caudal fins. Depending on the water clarity, the longnose gar comes in two colors. In clear water, they're a dark deep green color. In muddy waters, it's more brown in color. Edges of the ganoid scales and in between are black. These types of gar are occasionally fished by locals, and blamed for eating other fish in the rivers. The longnose gar has a large range of territory in North America, into the Gulf of Mexico. Located in Florida, Quebec, all Great Lakes except Lake Superior, Missouri, Mississippi, Texas, and northern Mexico. Roe The flesh of gar is edible, but its eggs contain an ichthyotoxin, a type of protein toxin which is highly toxic to humans. The protein can be denatured when brought to a temperature of 120 degrees Celsius, but as the roe's temperature does not typically reach that level when it is cooked, even cooked roe causes severe symptoms. It was once thought that the production of the toxin in gar roe was an evolutionary adaptation to provide protection for the eggs, but bluegills and channel catfish fed gar eggs in experiments remained healthy, even though they are the natural predators of the gar eggs. Crayfish fed the roe were not immune to the toxin, and most died. The roe's toxicities to humans and crayfish may be coincidences, however, and not the result of explicit natural selection. A gar leaps out of the water. Significance to humans Several species are traded as aquarium fish. The hard ganoid scales of gars are sometimes used to make jewelry whereas the tough skin is used to make such items as lamp shades. Historically, Native Americans used gar scales as arrowheads, native Caribbeans used the skin for breastplates, and early American pioneers covered the blades of their plows with gar skin. Not much is known about the precise function of the gar in Native American religion and culture other than the ritual \\"garfish dances\\" that have been performed by Creek and Chickasaw tribes.

Middle Ages According to an account which was written by an author in 1784, a nun who lived in a German convent in the 1400s began to bite her companions, the behavior soon spread through other convents in Germany, Holland and Italy. According to an 1844 book which cited an unnamed medical textbook, a nun who lived in a French convent during an unspecified time in the Middle Ages inexplicably began to meow like a cat, shortly leading the other nuns in the convent to meow as well. Eventually all of the nuns in the convent would meow together for a certain period of time every day, leaving the surrounding community astonished. This did not stop until the police threatened to whip the nuns. 1500‚àí1800 * The dancing plague of 1518 was a case of dancing mania that occurred in Strasbourg, Alsace (then part of the Holy Roman Empire) in July 1518. Numerous people took to dancing for days. * The Irish Fright took place in England and parts of Wales in December 1688 during the Glorious Revolution. False reports that Irish soldiers were burning and massacring English towns prompted a mass panic in at least nineteen counties, with thousands of people arming themselves and preparing to resist non-existent groups of marauding Irishmen. * Salem witch trials (1692‚àí1693) - In colonial Massachusetts, adolescent girls Abigail Williams, Betty Parris, Ann Putnam, Jr., and Elizabeth Hubbard began to have fits that were described by a minister as \\"beyond the power of Epileptic Fits or natural disease to effect.\\" The events resulted in the Salem witch trials, a series of hearings which resulted in the execution of 20 citizens and the death of five other citizens of Salem Village, Massachusetts (present day Danvers, Massachusetts) and nearby towns who were accused of practicing witchcraft. The episode is one of America's most notorious cases of mass hysteria, and it has been used in political rhetoric and popular literature as a vivid cautionary tale about the dangers of isolationism, religious extremism, false accusations and lapses in due process. * W√ºrzburg 1749 - An outbreak of screaming, squirming, and trance in a nunnery led to the execution of a suspected witch. * The Great Fear was a general panic that took place between 17 July and 3 August 1789, at the start of the French Revolution.John Merriman, a history of modern Europe from the French revolution to the present, volume 2, 1996, page 482. 1800‚àí1950 * Spring-heeled Jack - England, starting in 1837 * Basel and Gro√ü Tinz \\"Writing Tremor Epidemic\\" (1892, 1904) - The right hand of a ten-year-old girl in Gro√ü Tinz began trembling, which developed into full-body seizures that spread to 19 other students. A similar epidemic affected 20 in Basel, Switzerland. Twelve years later, the Basel school experienced another outbreak that affected 27 students. Legend of the first outbreak was said to have played a role. * Montreal (1894) - Sixty students at a ladies' seminary suffered an outbreak of fits and seizures, some for as long as 2 months. * Meissen \\"Trembling Disease\\" (1905‚Äì06) - An estimated 237 children were afflicted between October 1905 and May 1906. * Halifax Slasher (1938) - The Halifax Slasher was the name given to a supposed attacker of residents, mostly women, of the town of Halifax, England in November 1938. The week-long scare began after two women claimed to have been attacked by a mysterious man with a mallet and \\"bright buckles\\" on his shoes. Further reports of attacks by a man wielding a knife or a razor followed. The situation became so serious that Scotland Yard was called in to assist the Halifax police. On November 29 one of the alleged victims admitted that he had inflicted the damage upon himself for attention. Others soon had similar admissions, and the Yard investigation concluded that none of the attacks had been real. Five local people were subsequently charged with public mischief offenses, and four were sent to prison. * \\"War of the Worlds\\" radio broadcast (1938) - Newspaper headlines reported that thousands of American's were plunged into panic over an Orson Welles radio play, convinced that America was under a deadly Martian attack. * Bellevue, Louisiana (1939) - A girl developed a leg twitch at the annual homecoming high school dance. Attacks worsened and spread to friends over the next several weeks. * Mad Gasser of Mattoon, Illinois, 1940s 1950‚àí2000 * Seattle windshield pitting epidemic of 1954 * Tanganyika laughter epidemic (1962) - The Tanganyika laughter epidemic began on January 30, 1962, at a mission-run boarding school for girls in Kashasha, Tanzania. The laughter started with three girls and spread haphazardly throughout the school, affecting 95 of the 159 pupils, aged 12‚Äì18. Symptoms lasted from a few hours to 16 days in those affected. The teaching staff were not affected but reported that students were unable to concentrate on their lessons. The school was forced to close down on March 18, 1962. After the school was closed and the students were sent home, the epidemic spread to Nshamba, a village that was home to several of the girls. In April and May, 217 people had laughing attacks in the village, most of them school children and young adults. The Kashasha school was reopened on May 21, only to be closed again at the end of June. In June, the laughing epidemic spread to Ramashenye girls' middle school, near Bukoba, affecting 48 girls. Another outbreak occurred in Kanyangereka and two nearby boys schools were closed. * June bug epidemic (1962) - The June bug epidemic serves as a classic example of hysterical contagion. In 1962 a mysterious disease broke out in a dressmaking department of a US textile factory. The symptoms included numbness, nausea, dizziness, and vomiting. Word of a bug in the factory that would bite its victims and cause them to develop the above symptoms quickly spread.Alan C. Kerckhoff & Kurt W. Back (1968) The June Bug: a study of hysterical contagion, Appleton-Century-Crofts Soon 62 employees developed this mysterious illness, some of whom were hospitalized. The news media reported on the case. After research by company physicians and experts from the US Public Health Service Communicable Disease Center, it was concluded that the case was one of mass hysteria. While the researchers believed some workers were bitten by the bug, anxiety was probably the cause of the symptoms. No evidence was ever found for a bug which could cause the above flu-like symptoms, nor did all workers demonstrate bites. * Welsh, Louisiana (1962) - With students' sexual activity under close scrutiny by school officials, and following rumors of mandatory pregnancy tests, 21 girls and one boy in grades six to eleven were affected by seizures and other symptoms over six months. * Blackburn, England (1965) - In October 1965 at a girls' school in Blackburn, several girls complained of dizziness.Moss, P. D. and C. P. McEvedy. \\"An epidemic of overbreathing among schoolgirls.\\" British Medical Journal 2(5525) (1966):1295‚Äì1300. Web. 17 Dec. 2009. Some fainted. Within a couple of hours, 85 girls from the school were rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital after fainting. Symptoms included swooning, moaning, chattering of teeth, hyperpnea, and tetany. A medical analysis of the event about one year later found that outbreaks began among the 14-year-olds, but that the heaviest incidence moved to the youngest age groups. There was no evidence of pollution of food or air. The younger girls proved more susceptible, but disturbance was more severe and lasted longer in the older girls. Using the Eysenck Personality Inventory, those affected had higher scores for extroversion and neuroticism. It was considered that the epidemic was hysterical, that a previous polio epidemic had rendered the population emotionally vulnerable, and that a three-hour parade, producing 20 faints on the day before the first outbreak, had been the specific trigger. * Mount Pleasant, Mississippi (1976) - School officials suspected drug use after 15 students fell to the ground writhing, but no drugs were found and hysteria is assumed to be the culprit. At one point, one third of the school's 900 students stayed home for fear of being \\"hexed\\". * Malaysia (1970s‚Äì1980s) - Mass hysteria occurred in Malaysia from the 1970s to the 1980s. It affected school-age girls and young women working in factories. The locals have explained this outbreak as \\"spirits\\" having possessed the girls and young women.http://smj.sma.org.sg/1604/1604smj11.pdf * Hollinwell incident (1980) - Around 300 people, mostly children, but including adults and babies, suddenly suffered fainting attacks, nausea and other symptoms. The Hollinwell incident remains one of the prime examples of mass hysteria. * The 1983 West Bank fainting epidemic was a series of incidents in March 1983 in which 943 Palestinian teenage girls, mostly schoolgirls, and a small number of IDF women soldiers fainted or complained of feeling nauseous in the West Bank. Israel was accused of using chemical warfare to sterilize West Bank women while IDF sources speculated that a toxic substance had been employed by Palestinian militants to stir up unrest, but investigators concluded that even if some environmental irritant had originally been present, the wave of complaints was ultimately a product of mass hysteria. This conclusion was supported by a Palestinian health official, who said that while 20% of the early cases may have been caused by the inhalation of some kind of gas, the remaining 80% were psychosomatic. * Day-care sex-abuse hysteria was a moral panic that occurred primarily in the 1980s and early 1990s featuring charges against day-care providers of several forms of child abuse, including Satanic ritual abuse. * San Diego (1988) - The US Navy evacuated 600 men from barracks; 119 were sent to San Diego hospitals with complaints of breathing difficulty. No evidence of toxins, food poisoning, or any other cause was found. * Kosovo student poisoning, 1990 - Zoran Radovanoviƒá, a professor in the Faculty of Medicine in Kuwait argues in an article for the European Journal of Epidemiology that the \\"Kosovo Student Poisoning\\" that affected at least four thousand, mostly ethnic Albanians, was a product of mass hysteria. * Ganesha drinking milk miracle, 1995 * Belgium (June 1999) - Soft drink giant Coca-Cola withdrew 30 million units of its product from sale after more than a hundred people in Belgium and northern France complained of cramps, nausea and other problems after consuming the soft drinks. Testing found no evidence of tainted product and the incident was reported to be a panic, perhaps fueled by the discovery of dioxins in Belgian meat, which had brought down the national government earlier that year. * Many UFO reports may be the result of mass hysteria.How UFO Reports Change With the Technology of the Times  Smithsonian Magazine 2000s * North Carolina (2002) ‚Äì Ten girls developed seizures and other symptoms at a rural high school in North Carolina. Symptoms persisted for five months across various grade levels. Incidents tended to happen outside of class, with half of all incidents estimated to have occurred around lunch hour. Half of the affected were cheerleaders or former cheerleaders. * \\"Strawberries with Sugar virus\\" (2006) ‚Äì In May 2006, an outbreak of the so- dubbed Morangos com A√ß√∫car Virus (Strawberries with Sugar virus) was reported in Portuguese schools, named after the popular teen girl's show Morangos com A√ß√∫car (Strawberries With Sugar). 300 or more students at 14 schools reported similar symptoms to those experienced by the characters in a then recent episode where a life-threatening virus affected the school depicted in the show. Symptoms included rashes, difficulty breathing, and dizziness. The belief that there was a medical outbreak forced some schools to temporarily close. The Portuguese National Institute for Medical Emergency eventually dismissed the illness as mass hysteria. * Mexico City (2006‚Äì2007) ‚Äì Between October 2006 and June 2007, near Chalco, a working-class suburb of Mexico City, mass hysteria resulted in an outbreak of unusual symptoms suffered by more than 500 adolescent female students at Children's Village School (Villa de las Ninas), a Catholic boarding-school. The afflicted students had difficulty walking and were feverish and nauseated, some becoming partially paralyzed. * Vinton, Virginia (2007) - An outbreak of twitching, headaches and dizziness affected at least nine girls and one teacher at William Byrd High School. The episode lasted for months amid other local public health scares. * Afghanistan (2009‚Äì) - Starting around 2009, a spate of apparent poisonings at girls' schools across Afghanistan began to be reported, with symptoms including dizziness, fainting, and vomiting. The United Nations, World Health Organization and NATO's International Security Assistance Force carried out investigations of the incidents over multiple years, but never found any evidence of toxins or poisoning in the hundreds of blood, urine, and water samples they tested. The conclusion of the investigators was that the girls were suffering from mass psychogenic illness. Despite these findings, Afghan officials often blame the incidents on the Taliban, accusing them of contaminating the school's water supply or using poison gas. * Brunei (2010) - In April and May 2010, incidents of mass hysteria occurred at two all-girls secondary schools in Brunei. The most recent notable event happened on the 24 April 2014 in a public secondary school. The phenomenon caused a wave of panic among many parents, educators, and members of the community. Some of the students affected by the phenomenon claimed to have been possessed by spirits, or jinn, displaying histrionic symptoms such as screaming, shaking, fainting, and crying. * LeRoy, New York (2011‚Äì12) - In late 2011, 12 high school girls developed Tourette-like symptoms. Their school was tested for toxins, and all other factors for their symptoms were ruled out. The case, and some of the girls and their parents, gained national media attention. In January 2012, several more students and a 36-year-old adult female came forward with similar symptoms. They were all diagnosed with conversion disorder. * Sri Lanka (2012) - From November 15‚Äì20, 2012, incidents of mass hysteria occurred at 15 schools in Sri Lanka. More than 1,900 school children of 15 schools in Sri Lanka and five teachers were treated for a range of symptoms that included skin rashes, vomiting, vertigo, and cough due to allergic reactions believed to be mass hysteria. It originated at the Jinaraja Balika Vidyala in Gampola, Central Province on November 15, 2012 when 1,100 students were admitted to hospital with a range of symptoms that included skin rashes, vomiting, vertigo and coughing. Later, authorities had to close down the school for 3 days. After that on November 16‚Äì19 there were more reports of students from other parts of the country showing similar symptoms. * Charlie Charlie panic (2015) - Four teens in Tunja, Colombia were hospitalized, and several in the Dominican Republic were considered \\"possessed by Satan\\" after playing the Charlie Charlie Challenge viral game. * 2016 clown sightings ‚Äì Sightings of people in evil clown costumes in the United States, Canada, and 18 other countries were dismissed as a case of mass hysteria, stating that a fear of clowns (which is common in children and adults) may be an underlying cause. The website Vox likewise claimed that \\"The Great Clown Panic of 2016 has been perpetuated by pretty much everyone except actual clowns.\\" * Recurrent epidemic of mass hysteria (2016‚Äì2018) Nepal: A unique phenomenon of ‚Äúrecurrent epidemic of mass hysteria‚Äù was reported from a school of Pyuthan district of western Nepal in 2018. After a 9-year-old school girl developed crying and shouting episodes, quickly other children of the same school were also affected resulting in 47 affected students (37 females, 10 males) in the same day. Since 2016 similar episodes of mass psychogenic illness has been occurring in the same school every year. In 2016, twelve students were affected and in 2017, a total of 18 students of the same school were affected showing various symptoms in a single day. Hence it was thought to be a unique case of recurrent mass hysteria. * Emirates Flight 203, September 2018 ‚Äì 106 of 521 passengers on a 14-hour flight from Dubai to New York reported symptoms including coughing, sneezing, fever, or vomiting. The pilot notified airport ground staff, and personnel from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention met and quarantined the plane in New York and evaluated passengers, 11 of whom were sent to the hospital. A few passengers on the \\"flight from hell\\" turned out to have common colds or flu, with the other passengers coming to the belief that they were also sick after observing those around them.A Flight From Dubai Carrying Dozens Of Sick Passengers Was Quarantined In New YorkOn the Media - Plague of Suspicion * In August 2019 the BBC reported that schoolgirls at the Ketereh national secondary school (SMK Ketereh) in Kelantan, Malaysia, started screaming, with some claiming to have seen 'a face of pure evil'. Professor Simon Wessely a former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, suggested it was a form of 'collective behaviour'. Robert Bartholomew, a medical sociologist, suggested it was due to the stricter implementation of Islamic law in the school. The school responded to the outbreak by cutting down the trees around the school, believing they were home to supernatural spirits. * Starehe Girls Centre, Kenya (October 2019) ‚Äì 52 students were isolated with an unknown disease, showing symptoms of a high-pitched cough, sneezing and low-grade fever, a number that later rose to 68. As the number rose, the school's administration shut the school down and instructed parents to pick up their daughters. Specimens collected from the affected students showed only two cases of rhinovirus, a virus that is the predominant cause of the common cold. After carrying out psychological assessments on the students, a team of mental health specialists dispatched by Kenya's Ministry of Health to the school concluded that the 'mysterious' disease was a case of mass hysteria. * Mass hysteria occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, violence broke out in Ukraine over fear of the virus from quarantined evacuees from China. Ukraine authorities blamed the violence on a disinformation campaign targeting the country and spread over social media.

Types Monomania may refer to: * De Clerambault's syndrome (erotomania): Delusion that a particular man or woman is in love with the patient. This can occur without reinforcement or even acquaintanceship with the love object. * Id√©e fixe: Domination by an overvalued idea, for example, \\"staying thin\\" in anorexia nervosa * Kleptomania: Irresistible urge to steal * Pyromania: Impulse to deliberately start fires * Lypemania: Early elaboration later to become modern concept of depression * Narcissism: Pursuit of gratification from one's own attributes  History  Partial insanity, variations of which enjoyed a long pre-history in jurisprudence, was in contrast to the traditional notion of total insanity, exemplified in the diagnosis of mania, as a global condition affecting all aspects of understanding and which reflected the position that the mind or soul was an indivisible entity. Coined by the French psychiatrist Jean-√âtienne Dominique Esquirol (1772‚Äì1840) around 1810, monomania was a new disease- concept characterised by the presence of an expansive fixed-idea in which the mind was diseased and deranged in some facets but otherwise normal in others. Esquirol and his circle described three broad categories of monomania consistent with their traditional three-part classification of the mind into intellectual, emotional and volitional faculties. Emotional monomania is that in which the patient is obsessed with only one emotion or several related to it; intellectual monomania is that which is related to only one kind of delirious idea or ideas. Although monomania was retained as one of seven recognized categories of mental illness in the 1880 US census, its importance as a psychiatric diagnostic category was in decline from the mid-19th century.Berrios's note states: \\"Monomania was a diagnosis invented by Esquirol which achieved certain popularity, particularly in forensic psychiatry. It was never fully accepted by those not belonging to Esquirol's school and after severe attack during the 1950s, it gradually disappeared.\\" The reference to the 1950s is a typographical error and it should read the 1850s. This is evident from a reading of the section of Berrios's text which this note informs, the secondary and primary sources that Berrios uses to support this detail and other secondary and primary literature on the topic. For instance, at an earlier point in Berrios's text he writes: \\"...Esquirol's 'monomania' did not fare well ... and was killed in 1854 at a meeting of the Soci√©t√© M√©dico-Psychologique ...\\"  See also  * Addictive behaviour * Id√©e fixe (psychology) * Moral insanity  References   External links  * Historical and obsolete mental and behavioural disorders Mania ","title":"Monomania"},{"id":"247839","text":"A diadem is a type of crown.

Midnight is the transition time from one day to the next - the moment when the date changes, on the local official clock time for any particular jurisdiction. By clock time, midnight is the opposite of noon, differing from it by 12 hours. Solar midnight, or dark night, is the time opposite to solar noon, when the Sun is closest to the nadir, and the night is equidistant from dusk and dawn. Due to the advent of time zones, which regularize time across a range of meridians, and daylight saving time, solar midnight rarely coincides with 12 midnight on the clock. Solar midnight depends on longitude and time of the year rather than on time zone. In ancient Roman timekeeping, midnight was halfway between sunset and sunrise (i.e., solar midnight), varying according to the seasons. In the Southern Hemisphere, \\"midnight\\" had an ancient geographic association with \\"north\\" (as did \\"noon\\" with \\"south\\" ‚Äì see noon). Modern Polish, Belarusian, Ukrainian and Serbian languages preserve this association with their words for \\"midnight\\" (p√≥≈Çnoc, –ø–æ—û–Ω–∞—á, –ø—ñ–≤–Ω—ñ—á, –øo–Ωoƒß ‚Äì literally \\"half-night\\"), which also means \\"north\\". Start and end of day Midnight marks the beginning and ending of each day in civil time throughout the world. As the dividing point between one day and another, midnight defies easy classification as either part of the preceding day or of the following day. Though there is no global unanimity on the issue, most often midnight is considered the start of a new day and is associated with the hour 00:00. Even in locales with this technical resolution, however, vernacular references to midnight as the end of any given day may be common. Strictly speaking, it is incorrect to use \\"a.m.\\" and \\"p.m.\\" when referring to noon or midnight. The abbreviation a.m. stands for ante meridiem or before noon, and p.m. stands for post meridiem or after noon. Since noon is neither before nor after noon, and midnight is exactly twelve hours before and after noon, neither abbreviation is correct. However, many digital representations of time are configured to require an \\"a.m.\\" or \\"p.m.\\" designation, preventing the correct absence of such designators at midnight. In such cases, there is no international standard defining which arbitrary selection is best. In the United States and Canada, digital clocks and computers commonly display 12 a.m at midnight. The 30th edition of the U.S. Government Style Manual (2008), in sections 9.54 and 12.9b, recommended the use of \\"12 a.m.\\" for midnight and \\"12 p.m.\\" for noon. However, the previous 29th edition of the U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual (2000), in section 12.9, recommended the opposite. There is no further record documenting this change. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends avoiding confusion altogether by using \\"00.01 am\\" and the date instead of \\"midnight.\\" There are several common approaches to identifying and distinguishing the precise start and end of any given day. * Use of a 24-hour clock can remove ambiguity. The \\"midnight\\" term can be avoided altogether if the end of day is noted as 24:00 and the beginning of day as 00:00. While both notations refer to the same moment in time, the choice of notation allows its association with the previous night or with the following morning. This approach follows the 24-hour time specification of ISO 8601. * \\"Midnight\\" can be augmented with additional disambiguating information. A day and time of day may be explicitly identified together, for example \\"midnight Saturday night.\\" Alternatively, midnight as the division between days may be highlighted by identifying the pair of days so divided: \\"midnight Saturday/Sunday\\" or \\"midnight December 14/15.\\" * The approach recommended by the NIST (\\"12:01 a.m.\\" or \\"11:59 p.m.\\" instead of midnight) can be particularly helpful when any ambiguity can have serious consequences, such as with contracts and other legal instruments. * A clear convention may be legally defined or culturally promulgated.

Cylon, one of the Athenian nobles and a previous victor of the Olympic Games, attempted a coup in 632 BC with support from Megara, where his father-in-law, Theagenes, was tyrant. The oracle at Delphi had advised him to seize Athens during a festival of Zeus, which Cylon understood to mean the Olympics. However, the coup was opposed, and Cylon and his supporters took refuge in Athena's temple on the Acropolis. Cylon and his brother escaped, but his followers were cornered by Athens' nine archons. According to Plutarch and Thucydides (1.126), they were persuaded by the archons to leave the temple and stand trial after being assured that their lives would be spared. In an effort to ensure their safety, the accused tied a rope to the temple's statue and went to the trial. On the way, the rope (again, according to Plutarch) broke of its own accord. The Athenian archons, led by Megacles, took this as the goddess's repudiation of her suppliants and proceeded to stone them to death (on the other hand, Herodotus, 5.71, and Thucydides, 1.126, do not mention this aspect of the story, stating that Cylon's followers were simply killed after being convinced that they would not be harmed). Most likely, the story found in Plutarch is a later invention. Megacles and his genos, the Alcmaeonidae, were exiled from the city for violating the laws against killing suppliants. The Alcmaeonidae were cursed with a miasma (\\"stain\\" or \\"pollution\\"), which was inherited by later generations, even after the genos retook control of Athens. In April 2016, two mass graves containing 80 bodies, some shackled, were found in Palaio Faliro, a suburb of Athens. The skeletons date from the second quarter of the seventh century BC, and it has been suggested that they were the supporters of Cylon killed in the aftermath of his attempted coup.

It originated in the city of Birmingham and in the Black Country of Staffordshire, it is the direct descendent of the Bull and terrier which was itself bred from cross-breeding the Old English Bulldog and the Old English Terrier. The breed‚Äôs ancestors were bred primarily for the blood sports of dog fighting and rat-baiting. With the introduction of legislation criminalising blood sports including dog fighting in 1835 and again in 1911, attitudes changed which resulted in generations of responsible breeding and further breed refinement of the Stafford as a family pet and companion dog. The Stafford's association in early 19th century as a fighting dog made it difficult for the breed to gain recognition by the Kennel Club in the United Kingdom but was eventually added to their purebred registry in 1935. The Stafford is one of the most popular companion dog breeds in the United Kingdom, as well as Australia, France and New Zealand. Characteristics The Stafford is a stocky, muscular and unusually strong small to medium-sized dog that stands at the shoulder. The dogs weigh and the bitches . It has a broad chest, strong shoulders, well-boned wide-set legs, a medium length tail that is carried low and a broad head with a short muzzle; its ears fold over at the tips and are not cropped. The Stafford's coat is short, stiff and close. Base colours can be red, fawn, white, black or blue, or any one of the aforementioned with white, any shade of brindle or any shade of brindle with white. =Temperament and health= Even in the days of blood sport, the Stafford was always a family pet and companion dog, and is even more so today. They are considered loyal, courageous and affectionate, and are among the dog breeds recommended by the KC as suitable for families. They have a reputation for pugnaciousness, and when challenged by another dog it is characteristic of them to not back away. It is recommended that puppies receive early socialisation; certainly before 18 months. Staffords are healthy and robust dogs with a life expectancy of 12‚Äì14 years. Hereditary eye conditions, including L-2 Hydroxy Glutaric Aciduria (L-2HGA) and Hereditary Cataract (HC- HSF4Hereditary, are known to occur in the breed. The condition is caused by a mutant gene that can be identified through DNA screening to determine if the dog is clear, a carrier or affected. The KC, AKC, various other reputable organisations and breed clubs run DNA screening schemes and maintain the results in an effort to accurately identify and eliminate undesirable genetic diseases. History Two bulldogs Crib and Rosa, Abraham Cooper 1817 Dustman, bull and terrier, Benjamin Marshall 1804 First ever Staffordshire Bull Terrier show, Cradley Heath 1935. Gentleman Jim, Joseph Dunn's award-winning Staffordshire Bull Terrier =Early protection= The Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 made blood sports illegal, and effectively stopped bull and bear baiting in the UK. Bull and bear-baiting required large arenas which made it easier for authorities to police, whereas illegal dog fighting was much harder to terminate because fight sponsors kept their venues hidden and closely guarded in private basements and similar locations. As a result, dog fighting continued long after bull and bear-baiting had ceased. It was not until the passage of the Protection of Animals Act 1911 that organised dog fighting in Britain largely came to an end. =Early history= In the early 1800s, ‚Äúbull and terrier‚Äù crossbreeds had been developed to satisfy the need for vermin control and the taste for blood sports. In the mid‚Äì19th century, James Hinks wanted to develop a socially acceptable \\"gentleman's companion\\" with refinement, cleaner lines, and courage without the aggressive tendencies. Two different types of bull and terriers resulted, including Hink's cross of the bull and terrier with the English White Terrier to achieve a more refined appearance with better legs and a more appealing head. A later outcross included the Dalmatian and Collie which led to the development of an athletic white dog known as Hink's \\"white cavalier\\", the forerunner to the modern Bull Terrier. Devotees preferred the original bull and terrier type over Hink's Bull Terrier, and remained loyal to their preferred type, which became the modern Staffordshire Bull Terrier of the same ancestry as the Bull Terrier. =Theories of origin= The Stafford was developed in what was then considered the \\"black country\\" of Staffordshire and northern parts of Birmingham. There are two theories about the development of the Stafford as recognised by the KC registry. The first and more widely held theory is that the Stafford, like the Bull Terrier, descends from the long-extinct bull and terrier, which originated as a cross between the ferocious, thickly muscled Old English Bulldog and the agile, lithe and feisty Black and Tan Terrier. The aggressive Old English Bulldog, bred for bear and bull baiting, was often pitted against its own kind in organised dog fights, but it was determined that lighter, faster dogs were better suited for dogfighting than the heavier Bulldog. In an effort to produce a lighter, faster, more agile dog with the courage and tenacity of the Bulldog, breeders outcrossed with local terriers and ultimately achieved success. The second less widely held theory is that the Old English Bulldog was not crossed with terriers; rather, the Stafford as a breed began with direct descendants derived from generations of selective breeding of early Bulldogs which produced a smaller dog with a more athletic build. Some believe the theory is evidentially supported by certain genetic characteristics and similarities in the appearances of modern Staffords when compared to the Old English Bulldogs depicted in some of the early 19th- century paintings. =DNA analysis= In 2017, a genome-wide study revealed that all of the bull and terrier‚Äìtype dogs, including the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, map back to the terriers of Ireland and to origins which date to the period 1860‚Äì1870. The timing coincides with historical descriptions of dog fighting contests in Ireland, a lack of accurate stud book documentation, and subsequently, the undocumented crosses of dogs during the time when these breeds were first created. By 1874, in Britain the first Kennel Club Stud Book was published, which included Bull Terriers and Bulldogs. Global recognition In addition to recognition by the KC in 1935, the Stafford was later recognised in the breed registries of various other kennel clubs, including the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale, the American Kennel Club, Australian National Kennel Council, Canadian Kennel Club, Irish Kennel Club, New Zealand Kennel Club, and the United Kennel Club in the United States. = Kennel Club = The Stafford's early origins as a fighting dog made it difficult to gain recognition as a breed for entry in the KC's breed registry. In 1930, the name \\"Staffordshire Bull Terrier\\" first appeared in advertisements for dogs of the type. Throughout 1932 and 1933 attempts were made by dog show judge and breeder Joseph Dunn to gain breed registry recognition from the KC. In early 1935, the first show was held on the bowling green of the Conservative Club at Cradley Heath and in May that year, the KC approved the name \\"Staffordshire Bull Terrier\\" (the first name requested, \\"Original Bull Terrier\\", was rejected by the Kennel Club). In June 1935, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club was formed during a meeting at the Old Cross Guns pub in Cradley Heath. That same day, the breed standards were approved and further shows were held that year. Other pivotal breeders involved in acquiring breed recognition were Joe Mallen and actor Tom Walls. The first champions recognised in England were awarded in 1939 to the bitch Lady Eve and the dog Gentleman Jim. = American Kennel Club = Staffordshires, as the English bull and terrier crosses have been historically referred, first arrived in North America in the mid to late 1800s. AKC would not recognize anything they deemed to be pit bull types into their breed registry as they neither endorsed nor wanted to be associated with dog fighting. It was not until 1936, long after blood sports were banned and legislation was enacted, that AKC recognised and accepted the Staffordshire Terrier into its purebred registry, and in 1972 changed the name to American Staffordshire Terrier (AmStaff). AKC recognition of the English bred Staffordshire Bull Terrier (Stafford) would come two years later. In an effort to achieve AKC recognition of the Stafford, Steve Stone organised the US Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club, January 14, 1967. There were few Staffords in the country at that time, most being imports from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and other parts of the world. The first attempts to encourage club membership and gain AKC recognition began with the first rally held in the summer of 1967 which resulted in 14 memberships and 8 Staffords registered by the club. By year's end, the count had increased to 39 registered dogs. Dog imports continued, and the number of memberships and registered dogs increased exponentially but it would take nearly a decade of hosting sanctioned shows and demonstrating consistency in the breed standard by maintaining responsible breeding practices that the club would acquire official AKC recognition. In 1974, the AKC officially recognised the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club, giving it recognition as the official AKC Parent Club representing the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. On March 5, 1974, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier was the 120th breed recognised by the AKC. Confusion often arises over the Stafford and AmStaff being separate breeds, typically because of the similarities in nomenclature, appearances, ancestry, and variances between the standards of several different purebred registries. Appeal Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy. Staffords appeal for owners is for the most part because of their stout agility and muscular bodies which makes them appear tough while at the same time they are loving, courageous and loyal family dogs that are people- friendly. A survey conducted by Eukanuba revealed that Staffords and West Highland White Terriers are the \\"most communicative and affectionate breeds\\" with the Stafford being the \\"‚Äòwaggiest‚Äô (80%) and most partial to a belly rub (62%)\\". In 2019, ITV‚Äôs Britain's favourite dogs declared the Staffordshire Bull Terrier as the most popular dog breed in Britain. They rank among the most popular dog breeds in the UK, Australia, France and New Zealand. Due in part to its popularity, Staffords have experienced some negative impacts from over-breeding. In 2013, the breed accounted for more than a third of the dogs passing through shelters such as Battersea Dogs & Cats Home. The breed has been associated with chav culture, which tends to attract the negativity associated with it. According to American Kennel Club, it was their 82nd most popular dog in 2019. Breed-specific legislation In the United States the Stafford is commonly classified as a pit bull-type dog along with the American Pit Bull Terrier and the American Staffordshire Terrier, in other countries including the United Kingdom the term pit bull is used as an abbreviation for the American Pit Bull Terrier and does not encompass the Stafford. A number of federal and municipal governments have placed restrictions on the ownership of the pit bull-type dogs, including the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Some areas also regulate or restrict other breeds such as Dalmatian, German Shepherd, Chow Chow, American Bulldog, Rottweiler, Mastiff, Doberman Pinscher, and any mix or even a resemblance of those dogs. In the US, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) is opposed to breed-specific legislation, referring to it as \\"breed-discriminatory laws\\". In the UK, Australia and New Zealand, Staffords are not restricted by any breed-specific legislation. The AKC \\"supports state laws making any form of participation in organized dog fights a felony\\" and oppose the breeding and training of dogs for fighting. They also oppose the \\"training of dogs for uncontrolled aggressive behavior toward other dogs and people.\\" However, the AKC considers Breed-specific legislation (BSL) \\"a slippery slope\\" stating that \\"any dog can be exploited and trained to be aggressive\\" and expressed concern because they believe \\"breed-specific bans ultimately punish responsible dog owners, while doing very little to actually punish irresponsible owners.\\" In 2018, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) lobbied the British Parliament to have the Staffordshire Bull Terrier added to the list of restricted dog breeds in the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. PETA supported the legislation because they believed it would prevent more Staffords from being born into a world of cruel treatment and abuse. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), the KC, Dogs Trust, Blue Cross and the Battersea Dogs & Cats Home all objected to the proposed ban. Defra minister George Eustice gave his support saying, \\"Staffordshire bull terriers [sic] are a popular breed in this country and have shown themselves to be a good family pet.\\" Parliament rejected the legislation. = Irish Staffordshire Bull Terrier = In the UK, American Pit Bull Terriers are sometimes advertised as Irish Staffordshire Bull Terriers in an attempt to circumvent the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. The appearance of the Irish Staffordshire, which is not recognised by any kennel club or breed registry, is attributed by the RSPCA to be contributing \\"to a rise in incidents of dog fighting\\". The editor of Dogs Today magazine described the breed as \\"complete fiction\\".

History The American Record Company (commonly abbreviated as \\"ARCo\\") was founded by Ellsworth A. Hawthorne and Horace Sheble, formerly designers of accessories for Edison Records machines at their Philadelphia-based bicycle shop; in a previous venture, they had issued a small run of brown-wax cylinders in the mid-1890s. Hawthorne and Sheble partnered with John O. Prescott, whose brother Frederick worked with International Talking Machine in Berlin, which marketed Odeon Records. The new company was based in Springfield, Massachusetts, though they maintained factories in Bridgeport, CT and Philadelphia; recordings were made in a studio in New York City. American principally produced single-sided, lateral-cut disc records on blue wax, although two-sided issues and standard, black shellac appeared towards the end of the company's run. Logo The label of the discs featured artwork depicting a Native American with a smoking pipe listening to a front-mount disc phonograph of undetermined manufacture; American Record Company advertising commonly marketed them as \\"Indian Records\\".Mainspring Press Blog, \\"American Record (Hawthorne, Sheble & Prescott) Ads, 1904-1905\\" Several variations of the \\"Indian\\" label exist, differing only in minor details. Most ARCo records are single sided; with their double-sided records, apparently the combination of sides were randomly chosen. The company would press any two sides paired, if the buyer met the minimum-order qualification. These records are notable for being blue in color, rather than the usual black, pressed from a shellac compound called Empedite which reputedly delivered better sound quality than standard black shellac. The records appear to have been numbered using a sequence which began at 030000; the highest number known is 031435. The records exist in 7-inch, 10-inch and 10.75-inch sizes, with the latter size being derived from its connection with Odeon, which also used that size. The seven-inch discs used a different numbering sequence and seem to have only been produced for a short time. Some export pressings for Britain carried the \\"American Odeon Record\\" logo. Legacy Unlike most American producers of discs apart from Victor and Columbia in the first decade of the twentieth century, American Record Company made their own recordings in direct contravention to existing patents. The most important contribution made by ARCo to the history of recorded sound is that they made the earliest surviving records of Hawaiian music in several discs credited to the Royal Hawaiian Troubadours; this was a group led by July Paka. The house band was called the Regimental Band of the Republic and was responsible for most of the remaining instrumental selections on the label, in addition to providing accompaniments to singers. Other performers were mainly drawn from the ranks of singers that worked for Victor, Columbia and the cylinder companies, recording many of the same songs that they did elsewhere. Many ARCos are anonymous, though just as many if not more do carry an accurate credit as to the performer. Collectors of early records do value ARCOs; while not as common as early Columbias or Victors, they survive in decent numbers, especially when compared to discs on labels that they provided masters to, such as Busy Bee, Kalamazoo and Peerless. In Europe, their releases appeared on Pelican, Leader, American Odeon and Odeon.

Ch√≠ trai l√† n∆°i ƒë√¢y ∆∞·ªõc nguy·ªÅn!\\" it was changed to \\"N√∫i s√¥ng Vi·ªát Nam ta v·ªØng b·ªÅn\\", but when it was published it was changed to \\"N∆∞·ªõc non Vi·ªát Nam ta v·ªØng b·ªÅn!\\", which VƒÉn Cao commented, \\"With a song that requires solemn, 'n∆∞·ªõc non' seemed too weak while being sung with 'n√∫i s√¥ng' would be more reasonable.\\" After completion of work, VƒÉn Cao met and let V≈© Qu√Ω try the song. V≈© Qu√Ω was very happy at his work, and \\"Ti·∫øn Qu√¢n Ca\\" was published in papers on November 1944 with lithographs by VƒÉn Cao. On August 17, 1945, the song was sung for the first time at a rally of civil servants in Hanoi by a Ph.D under the flag of the Vi·ªát Minh, and \\"robbed the loudspeakers\\". VƒÉn Cao quoted, \\"That quiet man was an attraction to thousands of people listening that day\\".B√†i Ti·∫øn Qu√¢n Ca, h·ªìi k√Ω VƒÉn Cao tr√™n t·∫°p ch√≠ S√¥ng H∆∞∆°ng s·ªë 26, th√°ng 7 nƒÉm 1987 The poet and musician Nguy·ªÖn ƒê√¨nh Thi was touched after hearing VƒÉn Cao sing the song and asked each person to write another song for \\"The Viet Minh Frontline\\". He posted his own \\"Di·ªát Ph√°t X√≠t\\", meaning \\"Killing Fascists\\". VƒÉn Cao wrote \\"Chi·∫øn Sƒ© Vi·ªát Nam\\", meaning \\"Vietnam Soldiers\\". Both songs are still popular and sung to the public today. =As a national anthem= On August 17, 1945, H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh approved Ti·∫øn Qu√¢n Ca to be officially recognized as the anthem of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. On September 2, 1945, marching was officially performed on the day of the Proclamation of Independence at Ba ƒê√¨nh Square by the Liberation Army band commanded by ƒêinh Ng·ªçc Li√™n. At the day before the performance, musicians Dinh Ngoc Lien, Nguyen Huu Hieu, and VƒÉn Cao discussed for changing the two words in \\"Ti·∫øn Qu√¢n Ca\\" in order to shorten the song by shortening the length of the first E pitches in the word \\"ƒëo√†n\\" and the F in the middle of the word \\"x√°c\\" to make the song more \\"snappy\\". In 1946, the 1st National Assembly officially recognized \\"Ti·∫øn Qu√¢n Ca\\" as the national anthem. In the first Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Article 3, it states directly about the national anthem. In 1955, the 5th session of the first National Assembly decided to invite authors to participate in another editing of the song. VƒÉn Cao had regrets after this because the \\"heroic spirit\\" of the song had been lost after being edited. After 1975, the government of South Vietnam fell, and on July 2, 1976, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (in most common situation, the phrase \\"Viet Cong\\" actually refers to it) and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam agreed to be reunified into the new Socialist Republic of Vietnam. \\"Ti·∫øn Qu√¢n Ca\\" was chosen as the national anthem. In 1981, a contest was opened for a new national anthem but after more a year, it was and has never been mentioned again nor are there any official statement about the results. Thus, \\"Ti·∫øn Qu√¢n Ca\\" remains today as the national anthem of Vietnam. On July 8, 2016, Painter VƒÉn Thao, the eldest son of VƒÉn Cao confirmed that he and his family were going to donate the song to their country and people as his father's last wish. A letter, signed by all the legal inheritors in the family, stated that the family would donate the song for free use. On July 15, 2016, The National Assembly Office held a ceremony in Hanoi to receive the national anthem, donated by VƒÉn Cao's family members. Copyrighted anthem Shortly after the \\"donation\\", the Vietnam Center for Protection of Music Copyright stated that the national anthem would be under copyright protection regardless of the offer to \\"gift it\\" by VƒÉn Cao's family. It states that only certain situations like ceremonies and school could be anthem will \\"from now on be subject to royalty\\". Veteran composers objected to the idea, saying that \\"people should be allowed to sing this song without worrying about royalty\\". However, VƒÉn Cao said that his family \\"never reached consensus on 'gifting' the song, so they authorized the center to collect royalties on his father's songs\\".

When the Vatican's flag is ceremonially raised, only the first eight bars are played. While the Papal Anthem also serves as the national anthem of the Holy See and the Vatican City State, the Vatican stresses that it \\"is not to be understood as a national anthem\\"; it is a composition whose words and music \\"speak to the heart of many throughout the world who see in Rome the See of Peter.\\" History The music was composed in 1869 by Charles Gounod, for the celebration on April 11, 1869 of Pope Pius IX's golden jubilee of priestly ordination.

On October 16, 1949, Pope Pius XII declared it the papal anthem, replacing Viktorin Hallmayer's \\"Marcia trionfale\\" (1857), which, being still the papal anthem when the Vatican City State was founded in 1929, had been treated also as the new state's anthem. Gounod's \\"Marche Pontificale\\" was first performed in this new role during a ceremony on Christmas Eve of 1949, one day before the opening of the Holy Year 1950. The old state anthem too was played for a last time, almost as a token of respect.

He formulated Amdahl's law, which states a fundamental limitation of parallel computing. Childhood and education Amdahl was born to immigrant parents of Norwegian and Swedish descent in Flandreau, South Dakota. After serving in the Navy during World War II he completed a degree in engineering physics at South Dakota State University in 1948. He went on to study theoretical physics at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison under Robert G. Sachs. However, in 1950, Amdahl and Charles H. \\"Charlie\\" Davidson, a fellow Ph.D. student in the Department of Physics, approached Harold A. Peterson with the idea of a digital computer. Amdahl and Davidson gained the support of Peterson and fellow electrical engineering professor Vincent C. Rideout, who encouraged them to build a computer of their unique design. Amdahl completed his doctorate at UW‚ÄìMadison in 1952 with a thesis titled A Logical Design of an Intermediate Speed Digital Computer and creating his first computer, the Wisconsin Integrally Synchronized Computer, WISC. He then went straight from Wisconsin to a position at IBM in June 1952. Gene Amdahl is also related to former Minnesota Supreme Court Chief Justice Douglas K. Amdahl. The IBM and Amdahl years At IBM, Amdahl worked on the IBM 704, the IBM 709, and then the Stretch project, the basis for the IBM 7030. He left IBM in December 1955, but returned in September 1960 (after working at Ramo-Wooldridge and at Aeronutronic). He quit out of frustration with the bureaucratic structure of the organization. In an interview conducted in 1989 for the Charles Babbage Institute, he addressed this: On his return, he became chief architect of IBM System/360 and was named an IBM Fellow in 1965, and head of the ACS Laboratory in Menlo Park, California. He left IBM again in September 1970, after his ideas for computer development were rejected, and set up Amdahl Corporation in Sunnyvale, California with aid from Fujitsu. Competing with IBM in the mainframe market, the company manufactured \\"plug-compatible\\" mainframes, shipping its first machine in 1975 ‚Äî the Amdahl 470V/6, a less expensive, more reliable and faster replacement for the System 370/168. By purchasing an Amdahl 470 and plug-compatible peripheral devices from third-party manufacturers, customers could now run S/360 and S/370 applications without buying actual IBM hardware. Amdahl's software team developed VM/PE (Virtual Machine/Performance Enhancement), software designed to optimize the performance of IBM's MVS operating system when running under IBM's VM operating system. By 1979, Amdahl Corporation had sold over a US$1 billion of V6 and V7 mainframes and had over 6,000 employees worldwide. The corporation went on to distribute an IBM-plug-compatible front-end processor (the 4705) as well as high-performance disk drives, both jointly developed with Fujitsu engineers. At the 1967 Spring Joint Computer Conference, Amdahl, along with three other computer architects, most notably ILLIAC IV architect Daniel Slotnick, engaged in a discussion on future architectural trends. Amdahl argued, verbally and in three written pages, for performance limitations in any special feature or mode introduced to new machines. This resulted in two, major and lesser, \\"laws\\" of computer performance regarding sequential vs. parallel processing. These arguments continue to this day. 1979‚Äì2015: entrepreneur Amdahl left his eponymous company in August 1979 to set up Trilogy Systems, together with his son Carl Amdahl and Clifford Madden. With over US$200 million in funds, Trilogy was aimed at designing an integrated chip for even cheaper mainframes, but the chip development failed within months of the company's $60 million public offering; thereafter, the company focused on developing its VLSI technology and, when that project failed, in 1985, Trilogy merged into Elxsi. Elxsi also did poorly and Amdahl left in 1989, having already founded his next venture, Andor International, in 1987. Andor hoped to compete in the mid-sized mainframe market, using improved manufacturing techniques developed by one of the company's employees, Robert F. Brown, to make smaller, more efficient machines. Production problems and strong competition led the company into bankruptcy by 1995. Amdahl co-founded Commercial Data Servers in 1996, again in Sunnyvale, and again developing mainframe-like machines but this time with new super-cooled processor designs and aimed at physically smaller systems. One such machine, from 1997, was the ESP/490 (Enterprise Server Platform/490), an enhancement of IBM's P/390 of the System/390 family. Since then, CDS has changed its name and narrowed its focus. As Xbridge Systems, the company now builds software to scan mainframe datasets and database tables for sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security and other government identification numbers, sensitive medical diagnosis information that can be linked to an individual, and other information such as that needed for electronic discovery. In November 2004, Amdahl was appointed to the board of advisors of Massively Parallel Technologies. He died on November 10, 2015, in Palo Alto, California, from pneumonia, six days shy of his 93rd birthday. He also had Alzheimer's disease in the last years of his life. Gene and his wife, Marian, in front of the main house at Amdahl, Norway On the face of the mountain behind Gene and Marian there is a profile of a face, called the \\"Amdahl troll\\" Awards Amdahl was named an IBM Fellow in 1965, became a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1967 and was recognized as the Centennial Alumnus of South Dakota State University in 1986. He has numerous awards and patents to his credit and has received Honorary Doctorates from his two alma maters and two other institutions as well. Amdahl was elected Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society (DFBCS) in 1979 and in 1983, Amdahl was awarded the Harry H. Goode Memorial Award by the IEEE Computer Society \\"in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the design, applications and manufacture of large-scale high-performance computers.\\" In 1998, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum \\"for his fundamental work in computer architecture and design, project management, and leadership.\\" In November 2007, Amdahl was recognized with the SIGDA Pioneering Achievement Award. A banquet dinner in his honor featured a short talk by Amdahl on his career, and a panel debate on the future of parallel processing. Panelists included John Gustafson (known for Gustafson's law). The talk and debate were both videotaped, and are available through the SIGDA Web page, and the ACM Digital Library.

Built in Norway as MV Polar Circle, she was chartered by the Royal Navy in 1991 as HMS Polar Circle, before being purchased outright and renamed HMS Endurance in 1992. Endurance was a class 1 icebreaker. Her two Bergen BRG8 diesel engines produced over 8000 shaft horsepower enabling her to travel through ice up to thick at . Her propulsion system used a computer-controlled variable-pitch propeller and stern and bow thrusters. She carried two ice-modified Lynx helicopters which were instrumental in the making of the BBC Documentary Series Planet Earth in 2006. Endurance was laid up in Portsmouth from 2009 to 2016, following serious damage caused by flooding following an error during routine maintenance on a sea suction strainer. In October 2013 it was reported that she would be scrapped; in July 2015 the vessel was offered for sale for further use or recycling and left Portsmouth under tow to the Leyal ship recycling facility in Turkey on 1 June 2016. Career MV Polar Circle was built in Norway in 1990 by Ulstein Hatlo for Rieber Shipping. The Royal Navy chartered her for eight months as HMS Polar Circle from 21 November 1991. She was bought outright and renamed HMS Endurance on 9 October 1992. Endurance provided a sovereign presence in polar waters, performing hydrographic surveys and supporting the British Antarctic Survey in Antarctica. Her usual deployment saw her in the Southern Ocean and returning to the UK through tropical waters each year. Later, a longer, 18-month deployment was designed to maximise her time available for BAS usage. In 1997, Endurance made the first visit to Argentina by a Royal Naval vessel since the Falklands War, calling at the capital, Buenos Aires, en route to her Antarctic deployment. That she was seen as a scientific and research vessel rather than a warship facilitated the visit and helped to normalise relations between Argentina and the United Kingdom. She visited the Argentinian port of Mar del Plata in 1998 and returned to Buenos Aires in 2002. Sir Alan West (as he then was) on board Endurance for the Fleet Review . In 2005, Endurance was chosen to carry the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at the International Fleet Review as part of the Trafalgar 200 celebrations. In July 2007, the United Kingdom offered Endurance to supply Argentina's Antarctic bases after their icebreaker suffered extensive damage in a fire. Although she enjoyed a varied, purposeful career as the UK's sole ice patrol vessel, Endurances later years were problematic and ended in ignominy. After her 2004 docking period in Falmouth, the ship suffered a minor accident which resulted in her listing badly when the drydock she was situated in flooded up. The months after the refit were troublesome and the ship suffered numerous debilitating machinery failures. This was to become something of a theme over the next four years as the ship's crew struggled to keep her serviceable, set against more demanding challenges. =Docking in Puerto Belgrano 2006= During survey work in Antarctica in January 2006, the ship's engineering staff discovered that her rudder was apparently loose on the stock. Her work period was cut short and she returned to Mare Harbour in the Falkland Islands for further inspections. Det Norske Veritas, the ship's assurance certification company, instructed that the ship should dock at the nearest available port ‚Äì the nearest large enough being Puerto Belgrano, Argentina's largest naval base, where Endurance docked in mid-March 2006. Without hotel services on board, the ship's company moved to shore-side accommodation in the city of Bah√≠a Blanca, some twenty kilometres west of Puerto Belgrano. The rudder was removed for repairs, and once it was on the floor of the drydock, a dockers' strike followed. The ship remained there for nearly three weeks. Picket lines formed at the gates of the naval base, preventing the ship's company from relieving the stranded duty watch on board. When the strike broke, the rudder was replaced and welded into position and the ship left Puerto Belgrano in early April 2006. She returned to Portsmouth via Lisbon and to drydock again for further engineering work on the rudder and stock. =2008 near loss= In December 2008, while on an 18-month deployment, Endurance suffered extensive flooding to her machinery spaces and lower accommodation decks resulting in the near loss of the ship. A serious engine room flood left her without power or propulsion, and she was towed to Punta Arenas by a Chilean tug. After an extensive survey was completed, the estimates to refit the ship were put at around ¬£30m. On 8 April 2009 Endurance arrived off Portsmouth, on the semi-submersible transporter ship . The Royal Navy inquiry found that the flood happened while a sea-water strainer was being cleaned, in an attempt to improve the production of fresh water. The air lines controlling a hull valve were incorrectly reconnected, resulting in the valve opening and an inability to close it. The pipe installation fell below generally accepted standards, which made reconnection of the air lines ambiguous. The inquiry also found that, due to manpower constraints, the ship did not have a system maintainer and that clarity of engineering command had been lost, with no-one clearly in charge of risk-management. It was fortunate that, without propulsion, Endurance had drifted over an area shallow enough for anchors to be let go and to hold the ship in position, otherwise, \\"there was a very real possibility that she would have been lost either by running ashore or by succumbing to the flood.\\" The inquiry judged that the ship's company responded well to control damage in challenging conditions. =Ice Patrol (TV series)= In 2009, National Geographic Channel ran a four-episode documentary series on Endurance. Five ran the same series the following year under the name Ice Patrol, with the final episode showing what happened the day the ship almost sank. =Replacement= On 9 September 2010, speculation in the press suggested it was likely that Endurance would be scrapped and replaced with another icebreaker from Norway. On 22 March 2011, it was announced that the Royal Navy intended to hire MV Polarbj√∏rn, to be renamed , for three years whilst a final decision on whether to repair or scrap Endurance is made. was purchased in September 2013. It was announced on 7 October 2013 that Endurance would be sold for scrap, as it was not 'economically viable' to repair the damage sustained in 2008. In July 2015 the Ministry of Defence gave advanced notice of sale of the vessel for further use or recycling, noting that \\"parties interested in acquiring the vessel for future use should note it will require considerable investment\\". The vessel left Portsmouth under tow on her final voyage to the breakers yard in Turkey on 1 June 2016. Link to Sir Ernest Shackleton Endurance was named after the ship which Sir Ernest Shackleton used in his Antarctic expedition of 1914‚Äì1917. The names of Endurances boats and landing craft continued the Shackleton connection: James Caird and Dudley Docker were named after boats carried by Shackleton's Endurance, Nimrod was named after the ship which Shackleton used on his Antarctic expedition of 1907‚Äì1909, and Eddie Shackleton was named after the explorer's son. The motto of Endurance, \\"fortitudine vincimus\\" (\\"by endurance, we conquer\\"), was also the Shackleton family motto.

Macrocosm and microcosm refers to a vision of cosmos where the part (microcosm) reflects the whole (macrocosm) and vice versa. It is a feature present in many esoteric models of philosophy, both ancient and modern.Pierre A. Riffard, Dictionnaire de l‚Äô√©sot√©risme, Paris: Payot, 1983, 34. It is closely associated with Hermeticism and underlies practices such as astrology, alchemy and sacred geometry with its premise of \\"As Above, So Below\\".Antoine Faivre, Access to Western esotericism, State University of New York Press, 1994, 10-11. The philosophy was conceptualized by Pythagoras, who saw the cosmos and the body as a harmonious unity. The idea was re-articulated about a century later by Plato, and again during the Renaissance, by Leonardo da Vinci, who noted common features between the natural world and the human body such as the circulation of liquids and basic branching mechanisms. In modern sociology, the concept of microcosm has been predominantly used to describe a small group of individuals whose behavior is typical of a larger social body encompassing it. A microcosm can be seen as a special kind of epitome. Conversely, a macrocosm is a social body made of smaller compounds. In physics, scale invariance describes the same phenomenon.

He is best known for his defeat in the First Battle of Bull Run, the first large-scale battle of the American Civil War. In 1862, he was given command of the I Corps of the Army of the Potomac. He fought unsuccessfully against P.G.T. Beauregard's troops during the Valley Campaign of 1862, and was blamed for contributing to the defeat of United States troops at the Second Battle of Bull Run in August. Early life McDowell was born in Columbus, Ohio, son of Abram Irvin McDowell and Eliza Seldon McDowell.Land of the Buckeye genealogy website He was a cousin-in-law of John Buford,Eicher, pp. 105‚Äì106. and his brother, John Adair McDowell, served as the first colonel of the 6th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the Civil War. Irvin initially attended the College de Troyes in France before graduating from the United States Military Academy in 1838, where one of his classmates was P. G. T. Beauregard, his future adversary at First Bull Run. He was commissioned a second lieutenant and posted to the 1st U.S. Artillery. McDowell served as a tactics instructor at West Point, before becoming aide- de-camp to General John E. Wool during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He was brevetted captain at Buena Vista and served in the Adjutant General's department after the war. While in that department he was promoted to major on May 31, 1856. Between 1848 and 1861, McDowell generally served as a staff officer to higher-ranking military leaders, and developed experience in logistics and supply. He developed a close friendship with General Winfield Scott while serving on his staff. He also served under future Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston.\\"Irvin McDowell\\", Ohio History Central; accesses 2011.08.30. Civil War McDowell was promoted to brigadier general in the regular army on May 14, 1861, and was given command of the Army of Northeastern Virginia on May 27. The promotion was partly because of the influence of his mentor, Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase. Although McDowell knew that his troops were inexperienced and unready, and protested that he was a supply officer, not a field commander, pressure from the Washington politicians forced him to launch a premature offensive against Confederate forces in Northern Virginia. His strategy during the First Battle of Bull Run was imaginative but ambitiously complex, and his troops were not experienced enough to carry it out effectively, resulting in an embarrassing rout. General Irvin McDowell (left) with General George B. McClellan After the defeat at Bull Run, Major General George B. McClellan was placed in command of the new Union Army defending Washington, the Army of the Potomac. McDowell became a division commander in the Army of the Potomac. On March 14, 1862, President Lincoln issued an order forming the army into corps and McDowell got command of the I Corps as well as a promotion to major general of volunteers. When the army set off for the Virginia Peninsula in April, McDowell's command was detached for duty in the Rappahannock area out of concern over Stonewall Jackson's activities in the Shenandoah Valley (one division was later sent down to the Peninsula). Eventually, the three independent commands of Generals McDowell, John C. Fr√©mont, and Nathaniel P. Banks were combined into Major General John Pope's Army of Virginia and McDowell led the III Corps of that army. Because of his actions at Cedar Mountain, McDowell was eventually brevetted major general in the regular army; however, he was blamed for the subsequent disaster at Second Bull Run. McDowell was also widely despised by his own troops who believed him to be in cahoots with the enemy. He escaped culpability by testifying against Major General Fitz John Porter, whom Pope court-martialed for alleged insubordination in that battle. Pope and McDowell did not like each other, but McDowell tolerated serving under him with the full knowledge that he himself would remain a general after the war was over while Pope would revert to the rank of colonel. Despite his formal escape, McDowell received no new assignments for the next two years. Later service and postbellum career In July 1864, McDowell was given command of the Department of the Pacific. He later commanded the Department of California from July 27, 1865 to March 31, 1868, briefly commanded the Fourth Military Department, then commanded the Department of the East from July 16, 1868 ‚Äì December 16, 1872. On November 25, 1872, he was promoted to major general. On December 16, 1872, McDowell succeeded General George G. Meade as commander of the Military Division of the South, and remained until June 30, 1876. From July 1, 1876, he was commander of the Division of the Pacific. In 1882, Congress imposed a mandatory retirement age of 64 for military officers, and McDowell retired on October 14 of that year. In 1879, when a board of review commissioned by President Rutherford B. Hayes issued its report recommending a pardon for Fitz John Porter, it attributed much of the loss of the Second Battle of Bull Run to McDowell. In the report, he was depicted as indecisive, uncommunicative, and inept, repeatedly failing to answer Porter's requests for information, failing to forward intelligence of Longstreet's positioning to Pope, and neglecting to take command of the left wing of the Union Army as was his duty under the Articles of War. Following his retirement from the army, General McDowell exercised his fondness for landscape gardening, serving as Park Commissioner of San Francisco, California until his death from heart attack on May 4, 1885. In this capacity he constructed a park in the neglected reservation of the Presidio, laying out drives that commanded views of the Golden Gate. He is buried in San Francisco National Cemetery in the Presidio of San Francisco.

Lesage is best known for his comic novel The Devil upon Two Sticks (1707, Le Diable boiteux), his comedy Turcaret (1709), and his picaresque novel Gil Blas (1715‚Äì1735). Life =Youth and education= Claude Lesage, the father of the novelist, held the united positions of advocate, notary and registrar of the royal court in Rhuys. His mother's name was Jeanne Brenugat. Both Lesage's father and mother died when Lesage was very young, and he was left in the care of his uncle who wasted his education and fortune. P√®re Bochard, of the Order of the Jesuits, Principal of the College in Vannes, became interested in the boy on account of his natural talents. Bochard cultivated Lesage's taste for literature. At age 25, Lesage went to Paris in 1693 \\"to pursue his philosophical studies\\". In August 1694, he married the daughter of a joiner, Marie Elizabeth Huyard. She was beautiful but had no fortune, and Lesage had little practice. About this time he encountered an old schoolfellow, the dramatist Antoine Danchet, who is said to have advised him to take up literature. He began as a translator, and published in 1695 a French version of the Epistles of Aristaenetus, which was not successful. Shortly afterwards he found a valuable patron and adviser in the Abb√© de Lyonne, who bestowed on him an annuity of 600 livres, and recommended him to exchange the classics for Spanish literature, of which he was himself a student and collector. Spanish literature was once very popular in France when the queens of the house of Austria sat upon the throne, but had become neglected by Lesage's time. =First literary efforts= Frontispiece and titlepage of a 1708 English edition of The Devil upon Two Sticks, aka Le Diable boiteux. Lesage began by translating plays chiefly from Francisco de Rojas Zorrilla and Lope de Vega. Le Tra√Ætre puni and Le Point d'honneur from the former and Don F√©lix de Mendoce from the latter were acted or published in the first two or three years of the 18th century. In 1704, he translated the continuation of Don Quixote by Alonso Fern√°ndez de Avellaneda, and soon afterwards adapted a play from Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca, Don C√©sar Ursin, which was successful at court and damned in the city. Lesage was, however, nearly forty before he obtained decided success. In 1707, his farce, Crispin rival de son ma√Ætre, was well received, and Le Diable boiteux (with a frontispiece by Louise-Magdeleine Horthemels) was published and ran to several editions. Lesage altered and improved this play in 1725, giving it its present form. Notwithstanding the success of Crispin, the actors did not like Lesage, and refused a small piece of his called Les √âtrennes (1707). He thereupon altered it into Turcaret (1709), considered his theatrical masterpiece. =Prose writings= Some years passed before he again attempted romance writing, and then the first two parts of Gil Blas de Santillane were published in 1715, without the popularity of Le Diable boiteux. Lesage worked at it for a long time, and did not bring out the third part till 1724, nor the fourth till 1735. During these twenty years he was, however, continually busy. Notwithstanding the great merit and success of Turcaret and Crispin, the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais did not welcome him, and in 1715 he began to write for the Th√©√¢tre de la foire, the comic opera held in booths at festival time. According to one computation he produced, either alone or with others, about a hundred pieces, varying from strings of songs with no regular dialogues, to comediettas only distinguished from regular plays by the introduction of music. He was also industrious in prose fiction. Besides finishing Gil Blas he translated the Orlando innamorato (1721), rearranged Guzman d'Alfarache (1732), published two more or less original novels, Le Bachelier de Salamanque and Estevanille Gonzalez, and in 1732 produced Les avantures de monsieur Robert Chevalier, dit de Beauch√™ne, capitaine de flibustiers dans la Nouvelle- France, which resembles certain works of Daniel Defoe. Besides all this, Lesage was also the author of La Valise trouv√©e, a collection of imaginary letters, and of some minor pieces including Une journ√©e des Parques. He did not retire until 1740, when he was more than seventy years of age; he and his wife went to live with his second son, who was a canon at Boulogne-sur-Mer. Lesage's eldest son, Louis-Andr√©, had become an actor, and Lesage had disowned him. Lesage's last work, M√©lange amusant de saillies d'esprit et de traits historiques les plus frappants, appeared in 1743. =Retirement= With his wife he had three sons and a daughter whose filial piety made her devote her entire life to serving her genius father. Though he lived happily, one event embittered Lesage for years. His eldest son had been educated for the bar, but insisted going on stage. Lesage, who had often painted the life of the actor in the most ridiculous and hateful aspect, was pained by his son's career choice, especially when his son joined the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais, against which Lesage had long waged a satirical war. Probably out of deference to his father, the son took the name Montm√©nil, and by the merit of his talents and private character, soon entered the upper society of Paris. Lesage was reconciled with his son many years later and became so devoted to Montm√©nil that he could barely leave his side. Montm√©nil caught cold during a hunting party and died on 8 September 1743. This was such a severe blow to Lesage that he retired forever from Paris and the world. Lesage's youngest son had also become an actor under the name Pittenec, so Lesage and his wife saw out their old age in the home of their second son who had become the Abb√© Lesage (Abbott Lesage). This son had been made a Canon of the Cathedral of Boulogne, through the patronage of the queen, and been bestowed a fair pension. Lesage lived beyond 80 years of age, but was afflicted with deafness and had to use an ear trumpet. However, his conversation was so delightful that when he ventured into the world and frequented his favourite coffee house in Rue St. Jacques in Paris, guests would gather around him, climbing onto tables and chairs, to hear his famous words of wit and wisdom. Alain-Ren√© Lesage died on 17 November 1747. Personality Very little is known of Lesage's life and personality. The few anecdotes which we have of him represent him as a very independent man, declining to accept the literary patronage required to survive. One story tells of the time he had been entreated to read his manuscript (according to the fashion of the day) at the H√¥tel de Bouillon by the Duchess. The hour appointed for the reading was noon, but the dramatist was still very interested in legal matters and was detained until 1 o'clock attending the decision of a lawsuit. When he finally appeared at the H√¥tel and attempted to apologise, the Duchess of Bouillon was so cold and haughty, observing that he had made her guests lose one hour waiting for his arrival. \\"It is easy to make up the loss madame\\", replied Lesage; \\"I will not read my comedy, and thus you will gain two hours.\\" With that, he left the H√¥tel and could never be persuaded to go to the Duchess's house again. =Quotations= * \\"Pride and conceit were the original sins of man.\\" * \\"Facts are stubborn things.\\" Works Translations and adaptations * Le Tra√Ætre puni, 1700 * Don F√©lix de Mendoce, 1700 * Point d'honneur, 1702 (French version) * Second Book of the Ingenious Knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, 1704 * Orlando innamorato, 1721 * Guzman d'Alfarache, 1732 (French version) Plays * Don C√©sar Ursin, 1707 (French version) * Les √âtrennes, 1707 * Crispin rival de son ma√Ætre, 1707 (French version) * Turcaret, 1709 * Arlequin roi de Serendib, 1713 * La Foire de Guibray, 1714 * Arlequin Mahomet, 1714 * La Statue merveilleuse (fair play, with d'Orneval), 1720 (starts here in this collection--> French version) * La Bo√Æte de Pandore 1721, comedy in 1 act.Petite biblioth√®que des th√©√¢tres, Paris, 1789, vol.62 pp.67-8 Novels * Le Diable boiteux, 1707.

One of the most highly regarded singers of the 19th century, she performed in soprano roles in opera in Sweden and across Europe, and undertook an extraordinarily popular concert tour of the United States beginning in 1850. She was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music from 1840. Lind became famous after her performance in Der Freisch√ºtz in Sweden in 1838. Within a few years, she had suffered vocal damage, but the singing teacher Manuel Garc√≠a saved her voice. She was in great demand in opera roles throughout Sweden and northern Europe during the 1840s, and was closely associated with Felix Mendelssohn. After two acclaimed seasons in London, she announced her retirement from opera at the age of 29. In 1850, Lind went to America at the invitation of the showman P. T. Barnum. She gave 93 large-scale concerts for him and then continued to tour under her own management. She earned more than $350,000 from these concerts, donating the proceeds to charities, principally the endowment of free schools in Sweden. With her new husband, Otto Goldschmidt, she returned to Europe in 1852, where she had three children and gave occasional concerts over the next two decades, settling in England in 1855. From 1882, for some years, she was a professor of singing at the Royal College of Music in London. Life and career =Early life= Lind as Amina in La sonnambula Born in Klara in central Stockholm, Sweden, Lind was the illegitimate daughter of Niclas Jonas Lind (1798‚Äì1858), a bookkeeper, and Anne-Marie Fellborg (1793‚Äì1856), a schoolteacher. Lind's mother had divorced her first husband for adultery but refused to remarry until after his death in 1834. Lind's parents married when she was 14. Lind's mother ran a day school for girls out of her home. When Lind was about 9, her singing was overheard by the maid of Mademoiselle Lundberg, the principal dancer at the Royal Swedish Opera. The maid, astounded by Lind's extraordinary voice, returned the next day with Lundberg, who arranged an audition and helped her gain admission to the acting school of the Royal Dramatic Theatre, where she studied with Carl Magnus Craelius, the singing master at the theatre.Mdlle. Jenny Lind, The Illustrated London News, 24 April 1847, p. 272 Lind began to sing onstage when she was 10. She had a vocal crisis at the age of 12 and had to stop singing for a time, but she recovered. Her first great role was Agathe in Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz in 1838 at the Royal Swedish Opera. At 20, she was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music and court singer to the King of Sweden and Norway. Her voice became seriously damaged by overuse and untrained singing technique, but her career was saved by the singing teacher Manuel Garc√≠a with whom she studied in Paris from 1841 to 1843. He insisted that she should not sing at all for three months, to allow her vocal cords to recover, before he started to teach her a healthy and secure vocal technique. After Lind had been with Garc√≠a for a year, the composer Giacomo Meyerbeer, an early and faithful admirer of her talent, arranged an audition for her at the Op√©ra in Paris, but she was rejected. The biographer Francis Rogers concludes that Lind strongly resented the rebuff: when she became an international star, she always refused invitations to sing at the Paris Op√©ra. Lind returned to the Royal Swedish Opera, greatly improved as a singer by Garc√≠a's training. She toured Denmark where, in 1843, Hans Christian Andersen met and fell in love with her. Although the two became good friends, she did not reciprocate his romantic feelings. She is believed to have inspired three of his fairy tales: \\"Beneath the Pillar\\", \\"The Angel\\" and \\"The Nightingale\\". and Theodore Baker. \\"Hans Christian Andersen's Interest in Music\\", The Musical Quarterly, Vol. 16, No. 3 (July 1930), pp. 322‚Äì329 He wrote, \\"No book or personality whatever has exerted a more ennobling influence on me, as a poet, than Jenny Lind. For me she opened the sanctuary of art.\\" The biographer Carol Rosen believes that after Lind rejected Andersen as a suitor, he portrayed her as The Snow Queen with a heart of ice. =German and British success= In December 1844, through Meyerbeer's influence, Lind was engaged to sing the title role in Bellini's opera Norma in Berlin. That led to more engagements in opera houses throughout Germany and Austria, but such was her success in Berlin that she continued there for four months before she left for other cities. Among her admirers were Robert Schumann, Hector Berlioz and, most importantly for her, Felix Mendelssohn. Ignaz Moscheles wrote: \\"Jenny Lind has fairly enchanted me... her song with two concertante flutes is perhaps the most incredible feat in the way of bravura singing that can possibly be heard\\".Nelson, Lars P. \\"Jenny Lind\\", What Has Sweden Done for the United States? (1903), p. 21 That number, from Meyerbeer's Ein Feldlager in Schlesien (The Camp of Silesia, 1844, a role written for Lind but not premiered by her) became one of the songs most associated with Lind, and she was called on to sing it wherever she performed in concert. Her operatic repertoire comprised the title roles in Lucia di Lammermoor, Maria di Rohan, Norma, La sonnambula and La vestale as well as Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro, Adina in L'elisir d'amore and Alice in Robert le diable. About that time, she became known as \\"the Swedish Nightingale\\". In December 1845, the day after her debut at the Leipzig Gewandhaus under the baton of Mendelssohn, she sang without fee for a charity concert in aid of the Orchestra Widows' Fund. Her devotion and generosity to charitable causes remained a key aspect of her career and greatly enhanced her international popularity even among the unmusical. Daguerreotype of Lind, 1850 At the Royal Swedish Opera, Lind had been friends with the tenor Julius G√ºnther. They sang together both in opera and on the concert stage and became romantically linked by 1844. Their schedules separated them, however, as G√ºnther remained in Stockholm and then became a student of Garcia's in Paris in 1846‚Äì1847. After reuniting in Sweden, according to Lind's 1891 Memoir, they became engaged to marry in the spring of 1848, just before Lind returned to England. However, the two broke off the engagement in October of the same year.Holland, Henry Scott; William Rockstro; William Smyth; Otto Goldschmidt, Memoir of Madame Jenny Lind-Goldschmidt her early art-life and dramatic career 1820‚Äì1851, Volume 1, pp. 204 and 338‚Äì40 After a successful season in Vienna, where she was mobbed by admirers and feted by the Imperial Family, Lind traveled to London and gave her first performance there on 4 May 1847, when she appeared in an Italian version of Meyerbeer's Robert le diable. It was attended by Queen Victoria; the next day, The Times wrote: > We have had frequent experience of the excitement appertaining to \\"first > nights\\", but we may safely say, and our opinion will be backed by several > hundreds of Her Majesty's subjects, that we never witnessed such a scene of > enthusiasm as that displayed last night on the occasion of Mademoiselle > Jenny Lind's d√©but as Alice in an Italian version of Robert le diable.\\"Her > Majesty's Theatre ‚Äì First Appearance of Mademoiselle Jenny Lind, The Times, > 5 May 1847, p. 5 In July 1847, she starred in the world premi√®re of Verdi's opera I masnadieri at Her Majesty's Theatre, under the baton of the composer.\\"Her Majesty's Theatre\\", The Times, 23 July 1847, p. 5 During her two years on the operatic stage in London, Lind appeared in most of the standard opera repertory. In early 1849, still in her twenties, Lind announced her permanent retirement from opera. Her last opera performance was on 10 May 1849 in Robert le diable; Queen Victoria and other members of the Royal Family were present.\\"Her Majesty's Theatre\\", The Times, 11 May 1849, p. 8 Lind's biographer Francis Rogers wrote, \\"The reasons for her early retirement have been much discussed for nearly a century, but remain today a matter of mystery. Many possible explanations have been advanced, but not one of them has been verified\\". =Lind and Mendelssohn= Jenny Lind Token ND issued c. 1850 for her US tour, obverse Token with wrong year of birth, 1821, reverse In London, Lind's close friendship with Mendelssohn continued. There had been claims that their relationship was more than friendship.Duchen, Jessica. \\"Conspiracy of Silence: Could the Release of Secret Documents Shatter Felix Mendelssohn's Reputation?\\", published in The Independent, 12 January 2009. (Retrieved 4 August 2014) In 2013, George Biddlecombe confirmed in the Journal of the Royal Musical Association that \\"The Committee of the Mendelssohn Scholarship Foundation possesses material indicating that Mendelssohn wrote passionate love letters to Lind entreating her to join him in an adulterous relationship and threatening suicide as a means of exerting pressure upon her, and that these letters were destroyed on being discovered after her death\\".Biddlecombe, p. 83 Mendelssohn was present at Lind's London debut in Robert le diable, and his friend, the critic Henry Chorley, who was with him, wrote: \\"I see as I write the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose enjoyment of Mdlle. Lind's talent was unlimited, turned round and looked at me, as if a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind. His attachment to Mademoiselle Lind's genius as a singer was unbounded, as was his desire for her success.\\"Chorley, p. 194 Mendelssohn worked with Lind on many occasions and wrote the beginnings of an opera, Lorelei, for her, based on the legend of the Lorelei Rhine maidens; the opera was unfinished at his death. He included a high F-sharp in his oratorio Elijah (\\"Hear Ye Israel\\") with Lind's voice in mind.Edwards, Frederick George. The History of Mendelssohn's Oratorio 'Elijah, Chapter 2, Novello (1896), via Project Gutenberg (2011) Four months after her London debut, she was devastated by the premature death of Mendelssohn in November 1847. She did not at first feel able to sing the soprano part in Elijah, which he had written for her. She finally did so at a performance in London's Exeter Hall in late 1848, which raised ¬£1,000 to fund a musical scholarship as a memorial to him; it was her first appearance in oratorio.Sanders, L. G. D. \\"Jenny Lind, Sullivan and the Mendelssohn Scholarship\\", The Musical Times, September 1956, pp. 466‚Äì467 The original intention had been to found a school of music in Mendelssohn's name in Leipzig, but there was not enough support in Leipzig, and with the help of Sir George Smart, Julius Benedict and others, Lind eventually raised enough money to fund a scholarship \\"to receive pupils of all nations and promote their musical training\\". The first recipient of the Mendelssohn Scholarship was the 14-year-old Arthur Sullivan, whom Lind encouraged in his career.Rosen, Carol (2004). \\"Lind (married name Lind- Goldschmidt), Jenny (Johanna Maria)\\", in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography =American tour= Barnum poster In 1849, Lind was approached by the American showman P. T. Barnum with a proposal to tour throughout the United States for more than a year. Realising that it would yield large sums for her favoured charities, particularly the endowment of free schools in her native Sweden, Lind agreed. Her financial demands were stringent, but Barnum met them, and in 1850, they reached agreement. Together with a supporting baritone, Giovanni Belletti, and her London colleague, Julius Benedict, as pianist, arranger and conductor, Lind sailed to America in September 1850. Barnum's advance publicity made her a celebrity even before she arrived in the US, and she received a wild reception on arriving in New York. Tickets for some of her concerts were in such demand that Barnum sold them by auction. The enthusiasm of the public was so strong that the American press coined the term \\"Lind mania\\".Linkon, Sherry Lee. \\"Reading Lind Mania: Print Culture and the Construction of Nineteenth-Century Audiences\\", Book History, Vol. 1 (1998), pp. 94‚Äì106 Autograph of Lind after her marriage to Otto Goldschmidt After New York, Lind's party toured the east coast of America, with continued success, and later took in Cuba, the Southern US and Canada. By early 1851, Lind had become uncomfortable with Barnum's relentless marketing of the tour, and she invoked a contractual right to sever her ties with him; they parted amicably. She continued the tour for nearly a year, under her own management, until May 1852. Benedict left the party in 1851 to return to England, and Lind invited Otto Goldschmidt to replace him as pianist and conductor. Lind and Goldschmidt were married on 5 February 1852, near the end of the tour, in Boston. She took the name \\"Jenny Lind-Goldschmidt\\", both privately and professionally. Details of the later concerts under her own management are scarce, but it is known that under Barnum's management Lind gave 93 concerts in America for which she earned about $350,000, and he netted at least $500,000\\"America\\", The Times, 28 June 1851, p. 5 ($ and $, as of 2015, respectively).

Barnum and Jenny Lind\\", Vanity Fair, 22 December 2017 =Later years= Lind in her retirement Lind and Goldschmidt returned to Europe together in May 1852. They lived first in Dresden, Germany, and, from 1855, in England for the rest of their lives. They had three children: Otto, born September 1853 in Germany, Jenny, born March 1857 in England, and Ernest, born January 1861 in England. Although she refused all requests to appear in opera after her return to Europe, Lind continued to perform in the concert hall. In 1856, at the invitation of the Philharmonic Society conducted by William Sterndale Bennett, she sang the chief soprano part in the first English performance of the cantata Paradise and the Peri by Robert Schumann.First Philharmonic by Cyril Ehrlich, p. 103 In 1866, she gave a concert with Arthur Sullivan at St James's Hall. The Times reported, \\"there is magic still in that voice... the most perfect singing ‚Äì perfect alike in expression and in vocalization... Nothing more engaging, nothing more earnest, nothing more dramatic can be imagined.\\"\\"Review of the Jenny Lind ‚Äì Sullivan Concert\\", The Times, 13 July 1866, accessed 12 January 2019 at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive At D√ºsseldorf in January 1870, she sang in Ruth, an oratorio composed by her husband. When Goldschmidt formed the Bach Choir in 1875, Lind trained the soprano choristers for the first English performance of Bach's B minor Mass in April 1876, and performed in the mass.Elkin, p. 62 Her concerts decreased in frequency until she retired from singing in 1883. From 1879 until 1887, Lind worked with Frederick Niecks on his biography of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin.Lind apparently commissioned F√©lix Barrias's painting \\"La mort de Chopin\\", 1885 (Czartoryski Museum, Krakow): see Icons of Europe's essay, Why did Niecks write Chopin's biography? submitted in December 2004 to Chopin in the World In 1882, she was appointed professor of singing at the newly founded Royal College of Music. She believed in an all-round musical training for her pupils, insisting that, in addition to their vocal studies, they were instructed in solf√®ge, piano, harmony, diction, deportment and at least one foreign language.Lind-Goldschmidt, Jenny. \\"Jenny Lind and the R. C. M.\\", The Musical Times, November 1920, pp. 738‚Äì739 She lived her final years at Wynd's Point, Herefordshire, on the Malvern Hills near the British Camp. Her last public appearance was at a charity concert at Royal Malvern Spa in 1883. She died, at 67, at Wynd's Point on 2 November 1887 and was buried in the Great Malvern Cemetery to the music of Chopin's Funeral March. She bequeathed a considerable part of her wealth to help poor Protestant students in Sweden receive an education. Critical reputation Sheet music cover There are no known surviving recordings of Lind's voice. She is believed to have made an early phonograph recording for Thomas Edison, but in the words of the critic Philip L. Miller, \\"Even had the fabled Edison cylinder survived, it would have been too primitive, and she too long retired, to tell us much\\".Miller, Philip L. \\"Review\\", American Music, Vol. 1, No. 1 (Spring, 1983), pp. 78‚Äì80 The biographer Francis Rogers concludes that although Lind was much admired by Meyerbeer, Mendelssohn, the Schumanns, Berlioz and others, \\"In voice and in dramatic talent she was undoubtedly inferior to her predecessors, Malibran and Pasta, and to her contemporaries, Sontag and Grisi.\\" He notes that because of her expert promoters, including Barnum, \\"almost all that was written about her was undoubtedly biased by an almost overwhelming propaganda in her favor, bought and paid for\\". Rogers says of Mendelssohn and Lind's other admirers that their tastes were \\"essentially Teutonic\\" and, except for Meyerbeer, they were not expert in Italian opera, Lind's early specialty. He quotes a critic of the New York Herald, who noted \\"little deficiencies in execution, in ascending the scale, which even enthusiasm cannot deprive of their sharpness\\". The American press agreed that Lind's presentation was more typical of Germanic \\"cold, untouching, icy purity of tone and style\\", rather than the passionate expression necessary for Italian opera, and the Herald wrote that her style was \\"suited to please the people of our cold climate. She will have triumphs here that would never attend her progress through France or Italy\\". The critic H. F. Chorley, who admired Lind, described her voice as having \\"two octaves in compass ‚Äì from D to D ‚Äì having a higher possible note or two, available on rare occasions; and that the lower half of the register and the upper one were of two distinct qualities. The former was not strong ‚Äì veiled, if not husky; and apt to be out of tune. The latter was rich, brilliant and powerful ‚Äì finest in its highest portions.\\"Chorley, H. F., quoted in Chorley praised her breath management, her use of pianissimo, her taste in ornament and her intelligent use of technique to conceal the differences between her upper and lower registers. He thought her \\"execution was great\\" and that she was a \\"skilled and careful musician\\" but felt that \\"many of her effects on the stage appeared overcalculated\\" and that singing in foreign languages impeded her ability to give expression to the text. He felt that her concert singing was more admirable than her operatic performances, but he praised some of her roles. Chorley judged her finest work to be in the German repertoire, citing Mozart, Haydn and Mendelssohn's Elijah as best suited to her. Miller concluded that although connoisseurs of the voice preferred other singers, her wider appeal to the public at large was not merely a legend created by Barnum but was a mixture of \\"a uniquely pure (some called it celestial) quality in her voice, consistent with her well-known generosity and charity\\".

Founded under the name of Colegio Santa Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s in 1505, it has a present student body of over 65,000, and is one of the top-ranked universities in the country. History The University of Seville originally dates to the 15th century. Created by Archdeacon Maese Rodrigo Fern√°ndez de Santaella, it was originally called Colegio de Santa Maria de Jesus, and was confirmed as a practicing university in 1505 by the papal bull of Pope Julius II. Today, the University of Seville is known for research in technology and science.Historia In the middle of the 13th century, the Dominicans, in order to prepare missionaries for work among the Moors and Jews, organised schools for the teaching of Arabic, Hebrew, and Greek. To cooperate in this work and to enhance the prestige of Seville, Alfonso the Wise in 1254 established \\"general schools\\" (escuelas generales) of Arabic and Latin in Seville. Alexander IV recognized this foundation as a generale litterarum studium by the Papal Bull of 21 June 1260 and granted its members certain dispensations in the matter of residence. Later, the cathedral chapter established ecclesiastical studies in the College of San Miguel. Rodrigo Fern√°ndez de Santaella, archdeacon of the cathedral and commonly known as Maese Rodrigo, began the construction of a building for a university in 1472; in 1502 the Catholic Monarchs published the royal decree creating the university, and in 1505 Julius II granted the Bull of authorization; in 1509 the college of Maese Rodrigo was finally installed in its own building, under the name of Santa Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s, but its courses were not opened until 1516. The Catholic Monarchs and the pope granted the power to confer degrees in logic, philosophy, theology, and canon and civil law. The colegio mayor de Maese Rodrigo and the university proper, although housed in the same building, never lost their separate identities, as is shown by the fact that, in the 18th century, the university was moved to the College of San Hermenegildo, while that of Maese Rodrigo remained independent, although languishing. Influence The influence of the University of Seville, from the ecclesiastical point of view, was considerable, though not equal to that of the Universities of Salamanca and of Alcal√°. Renowned alumni include Sebasti√°n Antonio de Cort√©s, Riquelme, Rioja, Luis Germ√°n y Rib√≥n, founder of the Horatian Academy, Juan S√°nchez, professor of mathematics at San Telmo, Mart√≠n Alberto Carbajal, Cardinal Belluga, Cardinal Francisco Sol√≠s Folch, Marcelo Doye y Pelarte, Bernardo de Torrijos, Francisco Aguilar Rib√≥n, the Abate Marchena, Alberto Lista, and many others who shone in the magistracy, or were distinguished ecclesiastics. The University of Seville had a great influence on the development of the fine arts in Spain. In its shadow the school of the famous master Juan de Mal Lara was founded, and intellects like those of Fernando de Herrera, Juan de Arguijo, and many others were developed, while literary and artistic clubs were formed, like that of Francisco Pacheco, which was a school for both painting and poetry. During the period of secularization and sequestration (1845‚Äì57) the University of Seville passed into the control of the State and received a new organization. At the same time that the royal university was established, the Universidad de Mareantes (university of sea- farers) was developed. Here, the Catholic Monarchs established the Casa de Contrataci√≥n by a royal decree of 1503, with classes for pilots and seamen, and courses in cosmography, mathematics, military tactics, and artillery. This establishment was of incalculable importance, for it was here that the expeditions to the Indies were organised, and the great Spanish mariners were educated. This form of polytechnic school, which, according to Eden, Bourn√©, and Alexander von Humboldt, had taught a great deal to Europe, fell into decay in the 17th century, following the fortunes of Spanish science. Equality, liberty, justice and pluralism The university enjoys the independence afforded by self-governance, which gives it a certain flexibility that may work to advantage in the hiring of professors and lecturers. The ancient motto of the university is: \\"Equality, Liberty, Justice and Pluralism\\". The university's stated mission is to educate students who will do the research and development necessary to scientific and technological innovation. This is reflected in the number of degrees offered; students attending the university have a choice of 65 different subjects and one of the widest ranges of academic and sporting facilities in Spain, making it a popular university for both Spanish and international students. In 2004 it had 73,350 students spread on different campuses, being second in number of students among Spanish universities. Campus internationalisation Since 1994, North American exchange students have been able to take classes taught by University of Seville faculty members in Spanish in the Faculty of Philology and the Faculty of Geography and History. As of Fall 2009, the university has agreements with 15 international organizations including the Council on International Educational Exchange, the College Consortium for International Studies, International Studies Abroad, SUNY New Paltz and Wells College. and St. John's University. The University of Seville has had a partnership with the Real Colegio Complutense at Harvard University since 2015.

The main building of the University of Seville is known as the \\"Old Tobacco Factory\\", named for its original use. Built in the 18th century, Seville's tobacco factory was the largest industrial building in the world at the time and remained a tobacco factory until the 1950s. This beautiful building is also the setting for the renowned opera, Carmen, by Bizet. Carmen was a fictional worker in the tobacco factory, the original story being a novella by Prosper M√©rim√©e.

He became known as one of the fathers of photography. Though he is most famous for his contributions to photography, he was also an accomplished painter and a developer of the diorama theatre.  Biography  Louis Daguerre was born in Cormeilles-en-Parisis, Val-d'Oise, France. He was apprenticed in architecture, theatre design, and panoramic painting to Pierre Pr√©vost, the first French panorama painter. Exceedingly adept at his skill of theatrical illusion, he became a celebrated designer for the theatre, and later came to invent the diorama, which opened in Paris in July 1822. In 1829, Daguerre partnered with Nic√©phore Ni√©pce, an inventor who had produced the world's first heliograph in 1822 and the oldest surviving camera photograph in 1826 or 1827. Ni√©pce died suddenly in 1833, but Daguerre continued experimenting, and evolved the process which would subsequently be known as the daguerreotype. After efforts to interest private investors proved fruitless, Daguerre went public with his invention in 1839. At a joint meeting of the French Academy of Sciences and the Acad√©mie des Beaux Arts on 7 January of that year, the invention was announced and described in general terms, but all specific details were withheld. Under assurances of strict confidentiality, Daguerre explained and demonstrated the process only to the Academy's perpetual secretary Fran√ßois Arago, who proved to be an invaluable advocate. Members of the Academy and other select individuals were allowed to examine specimens at Daguerre's studio. The images were enthusiastically praised as nearly miraculous, and news of the daguerreotype quickly spread. Arrangements were made for Daguerre's rights to be acquired by the French Government in exchange for lifetime pensions for himself and Ni√©pce's son Isidore; then, on 19 August 1839, the French Government presented the invention as a gift from France \\"free to the world\\", and complete working instructions were published. In 1839, he was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician. Daguerre died, from a heart attack, on 10 July 1851 in Bry-sur- Marne, from Paris. A monument marks his grave there. Daguerre's name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel tower.  Development of the daguerreotype  View of the Boulevard du Temple, taken by Daguerre in 1838 in Paris, includes the earliest known photograph of a person. The image shows a busy street, but because the exposure had to continue for several minutes the moving traffic is not visible. At the lower right, however, a man apparently having his boots polished, and the bootblack polishing them, were motionless enough for their images to be captured. There is also what appears to be a young girl looking out of a window at the camera. An engraving of Daguerre during his career In the mid-1820s, prior to his association with Daguerre, Ni√©pce used a coating of bitumen of Judea to make the first permanent camera photographs. The bitumen was hardened where it was exposed to light and the unhardened portion was then removed with a solvent. A camera exposure lasting for hours or days was required. Ni√©pce and Daguerre later refined this process, but unacceptably long exposures were still needed. After the death of Ni√©pce in 1833, Daguerre concentrated his attention on the light-sensitive properties of silver salts, which had previously been demonstrated by Johann Heinrich Schultz and others. For the process which was eventually named the daguerreotype, he exposed a thin silver-plated copper sheet to the vapour given off by iodine crystals, producing a coating of light-sensitive silver iodide on the surface. The plate was then exposed in the camera. Initially, this process, too, required a very long exposure to produce a distinct image, but Daguerre made the crucial discovery that an invisibly faint \\"latent\\" image created by a much shorter exposure could be chemically \\"developed\\" into a visible image. Upon seeing the image, the contents of which are unknown, Daguerre said, \\"I have seized the light ‚Äì I have arrested its flight!\\"National Geographic, October 1989, pg. 530 The latent image on a daguerreotype plate was developed by subjecting it to the vapour given off by mercury heated to 75 ¬∞C. The resulting visible image was then \\"fixed\\" (made insensitive to further exposure to light) by removing the unaffected silver iodide with concentrated and heated salt water. Later, a solution of the more effective \\"hypo\\" (hyposulphite of soda, now known as sodium thiosulfate) was used instead. The resultant plate produced an exact reproduction of the scene. The image was laterally reversed‚Äîas images in mirrors are‚Äîunless a mirror or inverting prism was used during exposure to flip the image. To be seen optimally, the image had to be lit at a certain angle and viewed so that the smooth parts of its mirror-like surface, which represented the darkest parts of the image, reflected something dark or dimly lit. The surface was subject to tarnishing by prolonged exposure to the air and was so soft that it could be marred by the slightest friction, so a daguerreotype was almost always sealed under glass before being framed (as was commonly done in France) or mounted in a small folding case (as was normal in the UK and US). Daguerreotypes were usually portraits; the rarer landscape views and other unusual subjects are now much sought-after by collectors and sell for much higher prices than ordinary portraits. At the time of its introduction, the process required exposures lasting ten minutes or more for brightly sunlit subjects, so portraiture was an impractical ordeal. Samuel Morse was astonished to learn that daguerreotypes of the streets of Paris did not show any people, horses or vehicles, until he realized that due to the long exposure times all moving objects became invisible. Within a few years, exposures had been reduced to as little as a few seconds by the use of additional sensitizing chemicals and \\"faster\\" lenses such as Petzval's portrait lens, the first mathematically calculated lens. The daguerreotype was the Polaroid film of its day: it produced a unique image which could only be duplicated by using a camera to photograph the original. Despite this drawback, millions of daguerreotypes were produced. The paper-based calotype process, introduced by Henry Fox Talbot in 1841, allowed the production of an unlimited number of copies by simple contact printing, but it had its own shortcomings‚Äîthe grain of the paper was obtrusively visible in the image, and the extremely fine detail of which the daguerreotype was capable was not possible. The introduction of the wet collodion process in the early 1850s provided the basis for a negative- positive print-making process not subject to these limitations, although it, like the daguerreotype, was initially used to produce one-of-a-kind images‚Äîambrotypes on glass and tintypes on black-lacquered iron sheets‚Äîrather than prints on paper. These new types of images were much less expensive than daguerreotypes, and they were easier to view. By 1860 few photographers were still using Daguerre's process. The same small ornate cases commonly used to house daguerreotypes were also used for images produced by the later and very different ambrotype and tintype processes, and the images originally in them were sometimes later discarded so that they could be used to display photographic paper prints. It is now a very common error for any image in such a case to be described as \\"a daguerreotype\\". A true daguerreotype is always an image on a highly polished silver surface, usually under protective glass. If it is viewed while a brightly lit sheet of white paper is held so as to be seen reflected in its mirror-like metal surface, the daguerreotype image will appear as a relatively faint negative‚Äîits dark and light areas reversed‚Äîinstead of a normal positive. Other types of photographic images are almost never on polished metal and do not exhibit this peculiar characteristic of appearing positive or negative depending on the lighting and reflections.  Competition with Talbot  Unbeknownst to either inventor, Daguerre's developmental work in the mid-1830s coincided with photographic experiments being conducted by William Henry Fox Talbot in England. Talbot had succeeded in producing a \\"sensitive paper\\" impregnated with silver chloride and capturing small camera images on it in the summer of 1835, though he did not publicly reveal this until January 1839. Talbot was unaware that Daguerre's late partner Ni√©pce had obtained similar small camera images on silver- chloride-coated paper nearly twenty years earlier. Ni√©pce could find no way to keep them from darkening all over when exposed to light for viewing and had therefore turned away from silver salts to experiment with other substances such as bitumen. Talbot chemically stabilized his images to withstand subsequent inspection in daylight by treating them with a strong solution of common salt. When the first reports of the French Academy of Sciences announcement of Daguerre's invention reached Talbot, with no details about the exact nature of the images or the process itself, he assumed that methods similar to his own must have been used, and promptly wrote an open letter to the Academy claiming priority of invention. Although it soon became apparent that Daguerre's process was very unlike his own, Talbot had been stimulated to resume his long-discontinued photographic experiments. The developed out daguerreotype process only required an exposure sufficient to create a very faint or completely invisible latent image which was then chemically developed to full visibility. Talbot's earlier \\"sensitive paper\\" (now known as \\"salted paper\\") process was a printed out process that required prolonged exposure in the camera until the image was fully formed, but his later calotype (also known as talbotype) paper negative process, introduced in 1841, also used latent image development, greatly reducing the exposure needed, and making it competitive with the daguerreotype. Daguerre's agent Miles Berry applied for a British patent under the instruction of Daguerre just days before France declared the invention \\"free to the world\\". The United Kingdom was thereby uniquely denied France's free gift, and became the only country where the payment of license fees was required. This had the effect of inhibiting the spread of the process there, to the eventual advantage of competing processes which were subsequently introduced into England. Antoine Claudet was one of the few people legally licensed to make daguerreotypes in Britain. Wood, R.D., Annals of Science, 1997, Vol 54, pp. 489‚Äì506.  Diorama theatres  Diagram of the London diorama buildingIn the spring of 1821, Daguerre partnered with Charles Marie Bouton with the common goal of creating a diorama theatre. Daguerre had expertise in lighting and scenic effects, and Bouton was the more experienced painter. However, Bouton eventually withdrew, and Daguerre acquired sole responsibility of the diorama theatre. The first diorama theatre was built in Paris, adjacent to Daguerre's studio. The first exhibit opened 11 July 1822 showing two tableaux, one by Daguerre and one by Bouton. This would become a pattern. Each exhibition would typically have two tableaux, one each by Daguerre and Bouton. Also, one would be an interior depiction, and the other would be a landscape. Daguerre hoped to create a realistic illusion for an audience, and wanted audiences to be not only entertained, but awe- stricken. The diorama theatres were magnificent in size. A large translucent canvas, measuring around 70 ft wide and 45 ft tall, was painted on both sides. These paintings were vivid and detailed pictures, and were lit from different angles. As the lights changed, the scene would transform. The audience would begin to see the painting on the other side of the screen. The effect was awe- inspiring. \\"Transforming impressions, mood changes, and movements were produced by a system of shutters and screens that allowed light to be projected- from behind- on alternately separate sections of an image painted on a semi-transparent backdrop\\" (Szalczer). Because of their size, the screens had to remain stationary. Since the tableaux were stationary, the auditorium revolved from one scene to another. The auditorium was a cylindrical room and had a single opening in the wall, similar to a proscenium arch, through which the audience could watch a \\"scene\\". Audiences would average around 350, and most would stand, though limited seating was provided. Twenty-one diorama paintings were exhibited in the first eight years. These included ‚ÄòTrinity Chapel in Canterbury Cathedral‚Äô, ‚ÄòChartres Cathedral‚Äô, ‚ÄòCity of Rouen‚Äô, and ‚ÄòEnvirons of Paris‚Äô by Bouton; ‚ÄòValley of Sarnen‚Äô, ‚ÄòHarbour of Brest‚Äô, ‚ÄòHolyroodhouse Chapel‚Äô, and ‚ÄòRoslin Chapel‚Äô by Daguerre. The Roslin Chapel was known for a few legends involving an unconsuming fire. The legend goes that the Chapel has appeared to be in flames just before a high-status death, but has later shown no damage from any such fire. This chapel was also known for being unique in its architectural beauty. Daguerre was aware of both of these aspects of Roslin Chapel, and this made it a perfect subject for his diorama painting. The legends connected with the chapel would be sure to attract a large audience. Interior of Roslin Chapel in Paris opened 24 September 1824 and closed February 1825. The scene depicted light coming in through a door and a window. Foliage shadows could be seen at the window, and the way the light's rays shone through the leaves was breathtaking and seemed to \\"go beyond the power of painting\\" (Maggi). Then the light faded on the scene as if a cloud was passing over the sun. The Times dedicated an article to the exhibition, calling it \\"perfectly magical\\". Diorama became a popular new medium, and imitators arose. It is estimated that profits reached as much as 200,000 francs. This would require 80,000 visitors at an entrance fee of 2.50 francs. Another diorama theatre opened in London, taking only four months to build. It opened in September 1823. The most prosperous years were the early to mid-1820s. The dioramas prospered for a few years until going into the 1830s. Then, inevitably, the theatre burned down. The diorama had been Daguerre's only source of income. At first glance, the event was tragically fateful. But the enterprise was already close to its end, thus losing the diorama tableaux was not completely disastrous, considering the funds granted under the insurance.

He developed a cult following who referred to his sets as \\"Saturday Mass\\". Influential post-disco DJ Fran√ßois Kevorkian credits Levan with introducing the dub aesthetic into dance music. Along with Kevorkian, Levan experimented with drum machines and synthesizers in his productions and live sets, ushering in an electronic, post-disco sound that presaged the ascendence of house music. He DJ'd at Club Zanzibar in the 1980s as well, home to the Jersey Sound brand of deep house or garage house. Early life Levan was born at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital, New York, to Minnie (n√©e Levan) and Lawrence Philpot. He has an older brother Isaac and sister Minnie who are biological twins. He was born with a congenital heart condition and suffered from asthma from a very young age which would make him prone to fainting in class. Although a fragile young boy, he excelled in math and physics, leaving an impression on his teachers that he would become an inventor one day. He inherited his love for music from his mother who loved blues, jazz, and gospel music, and he was able to use a record player from the age of three. As his mother reflects, \\"I'd make him put records on so that we could dance together.\\" While attending Erasmus Hall High School in the late 1960s and early 1970s, as the neighborhood of Flatbush transitioned to a predominantly African-American population due to white flight, the flamboyantly vanguard Levan (who dyed his hair orange nearly a decade before the ascendance of punk rock), was frequently bullied by his classmates. Eventually, he dropped out of high school and found assuagement in Harlem's longstanding ball culture as a dressmaker, where he first became acquainted with fellow designer and lifelong best friend Frankie Knuckles. He became infatuated with an idea of making the \\"music that would never stop\\" during a brief affair with hippie DJ David Mancuso, who introduced Levan to Manhattan's burgeoning underground downtown dance culture.Pareles, Jon (Nov 1992). Archives > \\"Larry Levan, 38; His Tastes Shaped Dance-Club Music.\\" The New York Times Company Retrieved 06-20-2014. Mancuso was the proprietor of The Loft, a minimally decorated, members-only dance club (uniquely situated in his home) where \\"punch, fruit and candy\\" were served in lieu of alcohol and music was processed by a state-of-the-art sound system. According to the pseudonymous \\"Apollo,\\" an acquaintance of Levan and Knuckles, \\"You could only get into the Loft by private invitation. This was not because Mancuso wanted to create an elitist environment; he intentionally wanted to bring together diverse groups of gays who wouldn't ordinarily party together to create a democratic, integrated venue. David was powerfully attracted to black music and culture as well as men, so this Loft party was instrumental in bringing together wealthy, white gay men, many of them music executives, with this black musical dance culture he adored.\\" Musical career Levan got his start alongside Frankie Knuckles at the Continental Baths, as a replacement for the DJ from The Gallery, Nicky Siano, who briefly employed both men as decorators at The Gallery and taught them his pioneering three turntable technique. Accordingly, Levan's DJing style was influenced by Siano's penchant for Philadelphia soul and upbeat rock and Mancuso's jazz- inflected eclecticism; as with Mancuso, he briefly dated Siano during the epoch. While Knuckles was still trying to make his way in the New York club scene, Levan soon became a popular attraction at venues such as SoHo Place due to his \\"diva persona,\\" which he had previously developed in the city's notoriously competitive black drag \\"houses\\". see p.67 At the height of the disco boom in 1977, Levan was offered a residency at the Paradise Garage. Although owner Michael Brody‚Äîwho employed Levan at the defunct Reade Street in 1976, where he \\"developed the techniques as well as the sound ‚Äì the deep, dark bass, the queasy, dubby emotion that he would extract from records ‚Äì that would make him a legend\\"‚Äîintended to create a downtown facsimile of Studio 54 catering to an upscale white gay clientele, the new venue initially drew an improbable mix of streetwise blacks, Latinos, and punks after a disastrous opening night alienated the target demographic; according to Mel Cheren of West End Records, Brody's former companion and a silent partner in the venture, \\"The sound equipment got stuck in a blizzard at an airport in Louisville, Kentucky. And people were kept outside in 17-degree weather. Some of them never came back... the club didn't really take on the atmosphere that people remember it for until 1980.\\" Open only to a select membership and housed in an otherwise unadorned building on King Street in Greenwich Village, the club and Levan's DJing slowly entered the mainstream. Influential WBLS DJ/programming director Frankie Crocker often mentioned the club on air and based his playlists around Levan's sets. The Richard Long & Associates Sound system (RLA) of the club included custom-designed \\"Levan Horn\\" bass speakers. Filling the void left by leading DJ/remixer Walter Gibbons following the latter's conversion to evangelical Christianity, Levan became a prolific producer and mixer in the 1980s, with many of his efforts crossing over onto the national dance music charts. Among the records that received Levan's touch were his remixes of \\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\\" by Inner Life, \\"Ain't Nothin' Goin On But The Rent\\" by Gwen Guthrie and \\"Heartbeat\\" by Taana Gardner, as well as his production work on \\"Don't Make Me Wait\\" by the Peech Boys, a group that Levan formed and was part of (and who became the New York Citi Peech Boys when the Beach Boys threatened a lawsuit due to the similar sound of the name). With a strong gospel tinge in the vocal arrangements and driven by a tinkling piano, the latter song is a quintessential example of the deejay's soulful aesthetic. One of the first dance releases to incorporate a dub music influence and an appended vocal-only edit, Levan tinkered with the song for nearly a year to the consternation of Mel Cheren, whose label, West End Records, was nearing bankruptcy. When it was finally released, much of the song's momentum had been lost and it stalled in the lower reaches of the charts. As the popularity of the Garage soared in the mid-1980s just as many of his longtime friends lost their battles with AIDS, Levan became increasingly dependent upon PCP and heroin. While performing, he began to ensconce himself within a protective entourage of drag queens and younger acolytes. At the Paradise Garage, Levan was described as being \\"worshipped, almost like a god.\\" As beat-matching and ideological stylistic adherence became the norm among club DJs, Levan's idiosyncratic sets (ranging the gamut from Evelyn \\"Champagne\\" King, Chaka Khan and Deodato with Camille to Kraftwerk, Manuel G√∂ttsching, and British synthpop) elicited criticism from some quarters. Nevertheless, he remained at the forefront of dance music; recordings of Levan's later sets at the Garage demonstrate his affinity for the insurgent sounds of Chicago house and hip-hop. The Garage ended its run with a 48-hour-long party in September 1987, weeks before Brody died from AIDS-related complications. The club's closure and Brody's death devastated Levan, who knew that few club owners would tolerate his quirks and drug dependencies. Although Brody had verbally bequeathed the club's sound and lighting systems to Levan, they were instead left to Brody's mother in his will. This change was reportedly instigated by the late impresario's lover and manager, who reportedly despised Levan. Despite protestations and pleas to the Brody family from Mel Cheren, the systems remained in storage as their property. Unable to secure a long-term residency after a stay at the short- lived club Choice in the East Village alongside DJ/proprietor Richard Vasquez and Joey Llanos, Levan began to sell his valuable records for drug money. Friends like Danny Krivit would buy them back for him out of sympathy. As the 1990s dawned, Levan was on the brink of a comeback. Dismissed as a relic in New York despite managing occasional appearances at the au courant Sound Factory, his popularity had nonetheless soared among connoisseurs of disco and early American electronic dance music in Europe and Japan. In 1991, he was brought over for the weekend to London by Justin Berkmann to DJ at London's Ministry of Sound nightclub. To the mutual surprise of both parties, he ended up staying for three months; during this period, he remixed and produced tracks for the club's record label and helped to tune the venue's acclaimed sound system. Although he was still dependent on heroin, Levan's 1992 tour of Japan garnered gushing accolades in the local press. Encouraged by Cheren, he entered rehab and continued his tentative recording forays. Francois Kevorkian described Levan's final Japanese sets as nostalgic and inspirational, imbued with an air of bittersweetness and closure. Later months and death Levan informed his mother in June 1992 that he had \\"lived a good life\\" and was \\"ready to die\\". Having been mildly injured on the Japanese tour, he was voluntarily hospitalized at Beth Israel Medical Center following his return to New York. Three days after being released into the care of his mother, he was re-hospitalized at Beth Israel with hemorrhoid symptoms. He died, aged 38, of heart failure caused by endocarditis at 6:15 p.m. EST, on Sunday, November 8, 1992. Personal life Levan was openly gay. He was previously romantically involved with Nicky Siano (a fellow Brooklynite and Mancuso disciple and Mel Cheren's ex-boyfriend). Frankie Knuckles and Levan were lifetime friends who were introduced to each other by a \\"drag queen called Gerald\\" when Levan was 15 years old; Levan and Knuckles both were active in the local drag scene. Legacy In September 2004, Levan was inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame for his outstanding achievement as a DJ. Tributes * Anything Goes!

It is the largest institution within the Seven Sisters. Smith is also a member of the Five College Consortium, along with Mount Holyoke College, Amherst College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Five College Consortium website. \\"Accessed July 9, 2009\\" Smith was the first historically women's college to offer an undergraduate engineering degree. Smith alumnae include notable authors, journalists, activists, politicians, philanthropists, actresses, filmmakers, academics, CEOs, two First Ladies of the United States, and recipients of the Pulitzer Prize, Academy Award, Emmy Award, MacArthur Grant, Peabody Award, and Tony Award. History The college was chartered in 1871 by a bequest of Sophia Smith and opened its doors in 1875 with 14 students and 6 faculty.\\"Sophia Smith\\" , Smith College website. When she inherited a fortune from her father at age 65, Smith decided leaving her inheritance to found a women's college was the best way for her to fulfill the moral obligation she expressed in her will: > I hereby make the following provisions for the establishment and maintenance > of an Institution for the higher education of young women, with the design > to furnish for my own sex means and facilities for education equal to those > which are afforded now in our colleges to young men.smith.edu , Smith > College Web site By 1915‚Äì16, the student enrollment was 1,724, and the faculty numbered 163. Today, with some 2,600 undergraduates on campus, and 250 students studying elsewhere, Smith is the largest privately endowed college for women in the country. The United States Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, was training grounds for junior officers of the Women's Reserve of the U.S. Naval Reserve (WAVES) and was nicknamed \\"USS Northampton\\". On August 28, 1942, a total of 120 women reported to the school for training. LTJG Harriet Ida Pickens and ENS Frances Wills, first African- American WAVES to be commissioned. They were members of the final graduating class at USNR Midshipmen's School (WR) Northampton, Massachusetts on December 21, 1944. Smith has been led by 11 presidents and two acting presidents. (Elizabeth Cutter Morrow was the first acting president of Smith College and the first female head of the college, but she did not use the title of president.) For the 1975 centennial, the college inaugurated its first woman president, Jill Ker Conway, who came to Smith from Australia by way of Harvard and the University of Toronto. Since President Conway's term, all Smith presidents have been women, with the exception of John M. Connolly's one-year term as acting president in the interim after President Simmons left to lead Brown University. * Laurenus Clark Seelye 1875‚Äì1910 * Marion LeRoy Burton 1910‚Äì1917 * William Allan Neilson 1917‚Äì1939 * Elizabeth Cutter Morrow 1939‚Äì1940 (acting president) * Herbert Davis 1940‚Äì1949 * Benjamin Fletcher Wright 1949‚Äì1959 * Thomas Corwin Mendenhall 1959‚Äì1975 * Jill Ker Conway 1975‚Äì1985 * Mary Maples Dunn 1985‚Äì1995 * Ruth Simmons 1995‚Äì2001 * John M.

The campus landscape now encompasses and includes more than 1,200 varieties of trees and shrubs. Camperdown Elm tree near arboretum. In April 2015, the faculty adopted an open-access policy to make its scholarship publicly accessible online. Academics Smith College has 285 professors in 41 academic departments and programs, for a faculty:student ratio of 1:9. It was the first women's college in the United States to grant its own undergraduate degrees in engineering. The Picker Engineering Program offers a single ABET accredited Bachelor of Science in engineering science, combining the fundamentals of multiple engineering disciplines. Smith has joined the SAT optional movement for undergraduate admission. Smith runs its own junior year abroad (JYA) programs in four European cities: Paris, Hamburg, Florence and Geneva.Smith College: Study Abroad . Smith.edu. Retrieved on 2013-09-07. These programs are notable for requiring all studies to be conducted in the language of the host country (with both Paris and Geneva programs conducted in French). In some cases students live in homestays with local families. Nearly half of Smith's juniors study overseas, either through Smith JYA programs or at more than 40 other locations around the world. Junior math majors from other undergraduate institutions are invited to study at Smith College for one year through the Center for Women in Mathematics. Established in the fall of 2007 by Professors Ruth Haas and Jim Henle, the program aims to allow young women to improve their mathematical abilities through classwork, research and involvement in a department centered on women. The Center also offers a post-baccalaureate year of math study to women who either did not major in mathematics as undergraduates or whose mathematics major was not strong.\\"Smith College Women in Mathematics Program\\" National Association of Mathematicians, Spring 2007 . Retrieved 3 September 2008. The Louise W. and Edmund J. Kahn Liberal Arts Institute supports collaborative research without regard to the traditional boundaries of academic departments and programs. Each year the Institute supports long-term and short-term projects proposed, planned and organized by members of the Smith College faculty. By becoming Kahn Fellows, students get involved in interdisciplinary research projects and work alongside faculty and visiting scholars for a year. Students can develop leadership skills through Smith's two-year Phoebe Reese Lewis Leadership Program. Participants train in public speaking, analytical thinking, teamwork strategies and the philosophical aspects of leadership. Through Smith's internship program, \\"Praxis: The Liberal Arts at Work,\\" every undergraduate is guaranteed access to one college funded internship during her years at the college. This program enables students to access interesting self-generated internship positions in social welfare and human services, the arts, media, health, education, and other fields. =Admissions= The 2019 annual ranking of U.S. News & World Report categorizes Smith as 'most selective'. For the Class of 2022 (enrolling fall 2018), Smith received 5,780 applications, accepted 1,789 (31.0%) and enrolled 613. The middle 50% range of SAT scores was 670‚Äì750 for critical reading and 670‚Äì770 for math, while the middle 50% range for the ACT composite score was 31‚Äì34 for enrolled first year students. =Rankings= Seelye Hall U.S. News & World Report's 2021 rankings placed Smith tied for the 15th overall best liberal arts college in the U.S., and rated it 8th for \\"Best Value\\", tied for 17th in \\"Best Undergraduate Engineering Program\\" at schools where doctorate not offered, tied for 19th in \\"Best Undergraduate Teaching\\", and tied for 94th in \\"Top Performers on Social Mobility\\". In 2019, Forbes rated Smith 81st overall in its America's Top Colleges ranking of 650 military academies, national universities, and liberal arts colleges. Kiplinger's Personal Finance places Smith 16th in its 2019 ranking of 149 best value liberal arts colleges in the United States. For 2020, Washington Monthly ranked Smith 23rd among 218 liberal arts colleges in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service. =Ada Comstock Scholars Program= The Ada Comstock Scholars Program is an undergraduate degree program that serves Smith students of nontraditional college age. The program accommodates approximately 100 women ranging in age from mid-twenties to over sixty. Ada Comstock Scholars attend the same classes as traditional undergraduates, either full or part- time, and participate fully in a variety of extracurricular activities. They may live on or off campus. Financial aid is available to each Ada Comstock Scholar with demonstrated need. Beginning in 1968, with the approval of the Committee on Educational Policy, Smith College initiated a trial program loosely titled The Continuing Education Degree for several women of non- traditional age who were looking to complete their unfinished degrees. Their successes inspired President Thomas C. Mendenhall and Dean Alice Dickinson to officially expand the program. In January 1975, the Ada Comstock Scholars Program was formally established under President Jill Ker Conway and in the fall of that year forty-five women were enrolled. The students range in ages, backgrounds, and geographical locations. The growth of the program peaked just over 400 students in 1988. The program is named for Ada Louise Comstock Notestein (1876‚Äì1973), an 1897 Smith graduate, professor of English and dean of Smith from 1912‚Äì23, and president of Radcliffe College from 1923‚Äì43. Ada Comstock Notestein devoted much of her life to the academic excellence of women. Considering education and personal growth to be a lifelong process, she stayed actively involved in women's higher education until her death at the age of 97. =Graduate degrees and study options= Smith offers men and women graduate work leading to the degrees of master of arts in teaching (elementary, middle or high school), master of fine arts, master of education of the deaf, master of science in biological sciences, master of science in exercise and sport studies and master and Ph.D. in social work. In special one-year programs, international students may qualify for a certificate of graduate studies or a diploma in American studies. Each year approximately 100 men and women pursue advanced graduate work at Smith. Also offered in a non- degree studies program is the Diploma in American Studies. This is a highly competitive one-year program open only to international students of advanced undergraduate or graduate standing. It is designed primarily, although not exclusively, for those who are teaching or who plan to teach some aspect of American culture and institutions. The Smith College School for Social Work is nationally recognized for its specialization in clinical social work and puts a heavy emphasis on direct field work practice. The program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. The school offers a Master of Social Work (M.S.W.) degree as well as a Ph.D. program designed to prepare MSWs for leadership positions in clinical research education and practice. The college has a limited number of other programs leading to Ph.D.s, and is part of a cooperative doctoral program co-administered by Amherst College, Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Traditions =Residential culture and student life= Smith requires most undergraduate students to live in on-campus houses unless they reside locally with their family. This policy is intended to add to the camaraderie and social cohesion of its students. Unlike most institutions of its type, Smith College does not have dorms, but rather 36 separate houses, ranging in architectural style from 18th-century to contemporary. It is rumored the architecture of Chapin House was the inspiration for the Tara Plantation House in Gone with the Wind. (Author Margaret Mitchell went to Smith for one year and lived in Chapin.) A novelty of Smith's homelike atmosphere is the continuing popularity of Sophia Smith's recipe for molasses cookies. These are often served at the traditional Friday afternoon tea held in each house, where students, faculty and staff members and alumnae socialize. Two cultural spaces on campus, used by students of color to build their community, include the Mwangi Cultural Center and Unity House. Mwangi originally opened as the Afro- American Cultural Center in 1968, but was later renamed in honor of the first female physician in Kenya, and Smith alum, Dr. Ng‚Äôendo Mwangi ('61). After loaning Mwangi to the other cultural organizations on campus for four years, the Black Students‚Äô Alliance decided to reclaim Mwangi in April 1990. Leaders, members and supporters of cultural organizations got together to form a group called UNITY, in October of the same year, to demand a space for other cultural organizations. Today, Unity House serves as a home to the 11 cultural organizations on campus. Two recent additions to the campus, both of which enhance its sense of community, are the architecturally dramatic Campus Center and the state-of-the-art Olin Fitness Center. In 2009, construction was also completed on Ford Hall, a new science and engineering facility. According to the Smith College website, Ford Hall is a \\"...facility that will intentionally blur the boundaries between traditional disciplines, creating an optimum environment for students and faculty to address key scientific and technological developments of our time.\\" The building was officially dedicated on October 16, 2009.Ford Hall: http://www.smith.edu/fordhall/ The campus also boasts a botanic garden that includes a variety of specialty gardens including a rock garden and historic glass greenhouses dating back to 1895. The botanic garden formerly featured a Japanese tea hut, which was removed in October 2015 following concerns over \\"issues of safety and vandalism.\\" Smith offers \\"panel discussions and seminars for lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students on subjects such as coming out as transgender at work.\\"April 8, 2007 article, Boston Globe, http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2007/04/08/when_she_graduates_as_he/ In 2003, Smith students voted to remove pronouns from the language of the Student Government Association constitution, in order to make that document inclusive of transgender students who don't identify with the pronouns \\"she\\" and \\"her.\\" Until 2013, transgender women were not allowed to attend Smith unless all their legal documentation consistently stated they were female. This policy came to public attention in March 2013 when Smith rejected the application of a trans woman named Calliope Wong. In the rejection letter, Smith's Dean of Admission Debra Shaver wrote \\"Your FAFSA indicates your gender as male. Therefore, Smith cannot process your application.\\" This policy was changed in 2013 to only require all non legal application materials to indicate a female identity, including references. Not satisfied with the change, students as well as various alumni formed the group Q&A; (\\"Queers and Allies\\") to advocate for more trans-inclusive policies. Q&A; subsequently protested the policy on Facebook and other social media websites, as well as staging protests on campus that garnered significant media attention. In 2014, Smith formed an Admissions Policy Study Group, co-chaired by Daphne Lamothe and Audrey Smith, who at the time were associate professor of Afro-American studies and vice president for enrollment, respectively. The group recommended that to be considered for admission to Smith, applicants live and/or identify as a woman, check the \\"female\\" box when applying, and that the President establish a working group to support all trans and non-binary students at Smith. These recommendations went to the faculty and the Board of Trustees and in 2015, Smith announced a new policy that only required female identification on the common application. Under the policy, transgender men and non-binary or genderqueer applicants are not eligible for admission. This new policy also affirms that any student who, once admitted, transitions to another identity other than \\"female\\" and, who completes the college‚Äôs graduation requirements, will be awarded a Smith degree. The Resource Center for Sexuality and Gender; The Office for Equity and Inclusion and its Trans/Non-binary Working Group; Transcending Gender, a student group focused on support and education; and the Transgender Support Group run by Counseling Services work to support trans and non-binary students at Smith across the gender identity spectrum. In the fall of 2018, students at Smith protested after a Smith employee called the police on a black student working at Smith over the summer, when the employee saw her in a common space. Organized by the Black Students‚Äô Alliance and the Smith African & Caribbean Students Association, students protested and walked out of the annual Smith convocation. While the incident received national attention and news coverage, Smith conducted an independent investigation and investigators found that there was no bias in the incident. In response to the incident, Smith hosted an Inclusion and Diversity Conference on April 10th, 2019, featuring workshops and presenters run by various members of the Smith community. However, during that time another controversy arose: the hiring of Mount Holyoke College and Smith's joint police chief, Daniel Hect. Students from both campuses brought to their administrators' attention the fact that Hect had \\"liked\\" far-right tweets on Twitter, such as Donald Trump tweeting \\"Build that Wall!\\" and a tweet from the National Rifle Association, before deleting his account once the conflict with students began.Tensions came to a head at the conference, when students protested a presentation from the campus police, including Hect, about policing in a diverse community. Protests continued the next day when hundreds of students participated in a sit-in organized by the group Students for Social Justice and Institutional Change, or SSJIC, outside of John M. Greene Hall. The group was originally formed to advocate for undocumented students, but expanded to a broad coalition of marginalized students, including students of color, low-income and trans students. The coalition presented a broad list of demands to the administration, proposing reform to many sectors of campus life, including curriculum, health and counseling services, accessibility, policing, admissions policies and affinity housing. In response to the demands, Smith launched a working group charged with identifying key themes in response to the day of inclusion and ensuing protests and revamped the Office of Equity and Inclusion, adding programmatic changes, new or modified positions, training and development opportunities and new events to promote inclusion and equity. Houses Ginkgo tree near arboretum Smith College has many different houses serving as dormitories. Each house is self-governing. While many students remain in the same house for the entirety of their four years at Smith, they are not obligated to do so, and may move to different houses on campus as space allows. While houses previously collected dues, in the 2019-2020 school year they were eradicated to avoid placing financial pressure on low-income students or students who were otherwise unable to pay without sacrificing funding for the House. Houses are found in four main regions of campus: Upper and Lower Elm Street, Green Street, Center Campus, and the Quadrangle. Each region can, in turn, be divided into smaller areas to more precisely provide the location of the house in question. In 2019, the college shifted from officially recognizing the four main areas of campus to instead categorizing houses in four neighborhoods: Ivy, Paradise, Mountain, and Garden. This change was largely internal, and categorizes houses by size rather than location. =Green Street houses= * Hubbard House ‚Äì Hubbard House is the residence of fictional President Selina Meyer from the HBO Show Veep.

It was named as the most haunted college in America by College Consensus. One such tale holds Sessions House is inhabited by the ghost of Lucy Hunt, who died of a broken heart after being separated from her lover, General Burgoyne. Reports of a ghost in Sessions House predate its history as a campus house. Built in 1751 by the Hunt family, the house has a secret staircase where, according to legend, the Hunt's eldest daughter Lucy would rendezvous with her lover, General Burgoyne. The two were ultimately driven apart, and in the 1880s it was believed the ghost of a heartbroken Burgoyne haunted the staircase. Since Sessions House became part of college housing in the 20th century, the specter has taken on a decidedly feminine identity, and some former residents of Sessions claim to have seen Lucy's ghost in the stairwell. Clubs, sports, and organizations In addition to the 11 varsity sports, there are currently more than 120 clubs and organizations that cater to Smith students‚Äô variety of interests. There are options that can be found based on academic, political, cultural, and athletic interests. If a student doesn't find an organization that fits their specific interest or need, they can create their own. =Athletics= Smith's athletic teams have been known as the Pioneers since 1986. The name expresses the spirit of Smith's students and the college's leadership role in women's athletics (the first women's basketball game was played at Smith in 1893). A new spirit mark was unveiled to the Smith community in December 2008. The new visual identity for Smith's sports teams marks the culmination of a yearlong project to promote visibility and enthusiasm for Smith's intercollegiate and club teams‚Äîand to generate school spirit broadly. The spirit mark is used for athletics uniforms, casual apparel and promotional items for clubs and organizations. As Smith was the first women's college to join the NCAA, the new mark is seen as linking the college's pioneering alumnae athletes to their equally determined and competitive counterparts today. Smith College does not have college colors in the usual sense. Its official color is white, trimmed with gold, but the official college logo is blue and yellow (a previous logo was burgundy and white). NCAA athletic teams have competed in blue and white (or blue and yellow, in the case of the soccer, crew, swimming, and squash teams) uniforms since the 1970s, and selected Pioneers as the official name and mascot in 1986. Popular club sports are free to choose their own colors and mascot; both Rugby and Fencing have chosen red and black. Smith has a rotating system of class colors dating back to the 1880s, when intramural athletics and other campus competitions were usually held by class. Today, class colors are yellow, red, blue and green, with incoming first-year classes assigned the color of the previous year's graduating class; their color then \\"follows\\" them through to graduation. Alumnae classes, particularly at reunion, continue to identify with and use their class color thereafter. =Cultural organizations= There are 11 chartered cultural organizations that fall under the UNITY title: the Asian Students‚Äô Association (ASA), Black Students‚Äô Alliance (BSA), Chinese Interregional Student Cultural Org (CISCO), South Asian Student Association of Smith (EKTA), Indigenous Smith Students and Allies (ISSA), International Students‚Äô Organization (ISO), Korean Students‚Äô Association (KSA), the Latin American Students‚Äô Organization (LASO), Multiethnic Interracial Smith College (MISC), Smith African and Caribbean Students‚Äô Association (SACSA), and the Vietnamese Students‚Äô Association (VSA). Smith College Website Multicultural Affairs The Black Students‚Äô Alliance is the oldest of all Unity organizations. In Fall 2012, as an effort to document the history of students of color on Smith campus, the Weaving Voices Archives Project was created. =Academic year events= Convocation signals the start of the fall semester. For new students it is the first chance to experience Smith College's tradition and spirit. Likewise, for some returning students, the annual event is like a big, welcome-home party as well as an occasion for celebration and an opportunity for creative attire. House communities develop imaginative themes for group fashion, and Smith seniors put special touches on favorite hats to create their own unique \\"senior hats,\\" to be worn for the first time at Convocation. Mountain Day is observed early in the fall semester. The President of the College selects a crisp, sunny, beautiful autumn day when the leaves are in full color, and announces the cancellation of classes by having bells rung on campus at 7:15 AM on the chosen day. The eager anticipation of Mountain Day leads to intense speculation meteorology by students in the weeks leading up to the surprise announcement. Traditional observance of Mountain Day by students might involve New England road trips or outdoor pursuits, and college dining services provides box lunches to be taken off-campus. Many of the Houses go apple picking together. Otelia Cromwell Day, named for Smith's first African-American student, began in 1989 to provide students with an in-depth program specifically addressing issues of racism and diversity. Afternoon classes are cancelled, and students are invited to participate in lectures, workshops, symposia and cultural events focused on a different theme each year. In 2020, Otelia Cromwell Day was renamed \\"Cromwell Day\\" to simultaneously honor Otelia Cromwell's niece Adelaide Cromwell, Smith College's first African-American faculty member. Rally Day In February 1876, the College began an annual observance of George Washington's birthday. In 1894, a rally became part of the day's events, and the focus of the celebration became primarily patriotic rather than exclusively social‚Äîthough always with a women's college twist. Students that year staged a mock debate on the subject, \\"Does Higher Education Unfit a Man for Domestic Life?\\" In 1906 the celebration was first referred to as Rally Day (although the name was not used officially by the College until 1992). In 1944, seniors made Rally Day the first public wearing of their graduation caps and gowns; since then, mortarboards have been replaced by wacky, often homemade hats. Today, the Rally Day Convocation is centered on a historical theme, and features a distinguished keynote speaker and the awarding of Smith College Medals to accomplished alumnae. =Reunions and commencement events= The Alumnae Association of Smith College hosts official class reunions every five years. All alumnae from all classes are welcome to return in any year; \\"off-year\\" alumnae attend campus-wide events as the \\"Class of 1776.\\" Traditional reunion and Commencement events are linked, and celebrate the close ties between Smith's alumnae and its graduating seniors and their families. At the conclusion of final exams, most underclasswomen leave the campus, while seniors remain in their houses for a week to celebrate and prepare for Commencement. Alumnae arrive for reunions later in the week, and many alumnae arrange for official accommodations in the campus houses, right alongside senior residents. Ivy Day Ivy Day, the day before Commencement, is the high point of reunion and a significant event for seniors as well. Junior ushers lead a parade through campus, carrying vines of ivy to be planted by the departing seniors as a symbol of their lifelong connection to the college. Alumnae (and, often, their children), dressed in white and wearing sashes in their class color, line up in reverse order by class along both sides of the route. Seniors line up nearest the end of the parade route, wearing traditional white outfits and each carrying a single red rose. All cheer each alumnae class as it marches past, then fall in to join the end of the parade. Many alumnae classes carry signs with humorous poems or slogans, or hold balloons or wear hats in their class color. Ivy Day festivities conclude in the Quad, where the seniors plant their ivy and speakers address alumnae on the progress of fundraising and the state of the college. Illumination Night, beginning at dusk on the Saturday evening before Commencement, is a celebration of the campus and a send-off of sorts for graduating seniors. Throughout central campus, electric street lights are replaced for one night by multicolored Japanese-style paper lanterns, lit with real candles. These hang on both sides of every walking path and cast a soft glow over the buildings and lawns. Student a cappella singing groups and improv comedy troupes roam the campus, stopping occasionally to entertain the crowds. A jazz band, hired by the college, turns the science buildings' courtyard into a dance floor. Seniors, alumnae, faculty and their families spend the evening on walking tours of the illuminated campus and Botanic Gardens. The major official event of the night is the Senior Step Sing: seniors gather on the steps of Neilson Library, where they are serenaded by members of the Sophomore Push committee, then are physically pushed off the stairs and \\"into the real world.\\" Until the early 1990s, all alumnae reunions were held during Commencement weekend. However, as the number of returning alumnae grew beyond the capacity of the campus, reunions were split into Reunion I/Commencement Weekend and Reunion II, held the following weekend. \\"Significant\\" reunions (50-, 25- and 10- year, but also 2-year) and the earliest reunion classes (65-year and prior) are assigned to Reunion I; other reunions (5-, 15-, 20-, 30-year, and so on) are assigned to Reunion II. There have been several controversies surrounding commencement over the years. See Smith College commencement controversies to learn more. Environmental sustainability Paradise Pond with portion of athletic fields visible (center left) Smith has taken numerous steps toward environmental sustainability, including a 30% reduction in energy use. Also, through a contract with Zipcar, the college has reduced the need for individually owned cars on campus. Complementing this effort, the college has also promoted sustainability through academics and through the arts. In keeping with its sustainability efforts, all Smith dining locations have discontinued the use of \\"to-go\\" supplies which included paper cups and plates, as well as plastic utensils. They now encourage students to bring their own, reusable containers and utensils if they wish to bring food back to their rooms. Smith College provides all students with a reusable drink container at the beginning of each academic year. In past years, these containers have been variations on travel mugs, Sigg bottles, and nalgenes. Those dining halls that still offer \\"To-Go\\" options no longer provide paper bags, and instead use wax paper bags, biodegradable plastic, and recyclable utensils made of vegetable cellulose. In the fall of 2017, Smith dining halls began to offer plastic tupperware containers students may borrow and return to the dining halls to be washed. For Smith's efforts regarding sustainability, the institution earned a grade of \\"A-\\" on the \\"College Sustainability Report Card 2010\\" administered by the Sustainable Endowments Institute. Smith was lauded for many of the indicator categories, including student involvement, green building, and transportation, but was marked down for endowment transparency.

During the Battle of Fraustadt on February 3, August II was only 120 km away, with a cavalry force about 8,000 men strong. That was one of the main reasons that Swedish General Rehnski√∂ld hurried to engage Schulenburg. The battle is an example of a successful pincer movement and was one of Sweden's greatest victories in the Great Northern War. Background Deployment The Saxon army had not chosen its position carefully; Schulenburg had been maneuvered into a position chosen by the Swedes. Rehnski√∂ld withdrew his forces from Schlawa to Fraustadt. Rehnski√∂ld later stated in his journals, ‚ÄúS√• resolverade jag att draga mig till Fraustadt tillbaka i den tanken att locka till mig fienden efter mig utur sin f√∂rdel, inbillandes honom att jag ville alldeles draga mig av‚Äù roughly translated as ‚ÄùThus I resolved to withdraw to Fraustadt with the thought to lure the enemy to me away from his advantageous position, deceiving him into thinking I was in full retreat‚Äù. The Saxons, superior in numbers regarding infantry (9,000 Saxons and 6,300 Russians), but with less cavalry (4,000 Saxons) than the Swedes, took a strong defensive position behind lines of chevaux de frise littered by artillery. In two lines, with cavalry on both flanks, between the villages of Geyersdorf and R√∂hrsdorf and ahead of the town of Fraustadt, entrenched behind frozen lakes and marshes opposing the Saxon-Russian army, Rehnski√∂ld placed his infantry of 3,700 men in the center in three columns and his cavalry consisting of 5,700 units on both flanks. The battle Saxony (Left), Sweden (Right) On the left flank, the Swedish cavalry under Hummerhielm had some trouble passing through a frozen swamp, but the Saxon cavalry did not use that advantage. After regrouping, the Swedes charged the Saxon Garde du Corps and Chevaliers Garde regiments three times, utterly routing them. Colonel von Krassow, commander of the Swedish cavalry on the right flank, passed outside the left Russian flank with 12 dragoon squadrons, near the village of R√∂rsdorf, and engaged the Saxon Cavalry covering the Russian flank. After witnessing the destruction of the Saxon right flank, the left flank fled, and were routed by the Swedish dragoons. Colonel von Krassow's cavalry then wheeled clock-wise into the Saxon-Russian rear, which caused several of the Saxon regiments to break formation. On the Saxon left flank, facing Rehnski√∂ld's infantry, the Russians were deployed with their uniforms inside-out so they would look more like Saxons with their red colors instead of the Russian-standard green. This was however an order from Schulenburg who questioned their battle skills to reveal the weakness of the flank. The Swedish infantry assaulted the Saxon-Russian line frontally, under heavy cannon and musket fire. Upon discovering that the left wing of the enemy line was held by the Russian troops, Rhenski√∂ld directed his infantry to assault their positions, which were also being attacked from the rear by colonel von Krassow's cavalry. The Russian infantry were quickly surrounded and dispersed. The Saxon middle had its flank and rear exposed, and its regiments buckled and broke formation in short order under the pressure along its left flank. The Saxon right flank initially held, inflicting some damage to the Swedish infantry until the cavalry in the frozen swamp attacked their rear. The Saxon-Russian army fell apart and the main body fled to the south through Fraustadt. The Swedish cavalry, previously bogged down in the swamp, raced ahead on the open terrain, and met the fleeing Saxons and Russians on the far outskirts of the town. Trapped by Swedish cavalry to their front and infantry to their rear, the defeated Saxon-Russian forces surrendered en masse. =Casualties and losses= In the end 7,377 Saxons and Russians had been killed and over 7,300 taken prisoner where of 2,000 of them were wounded. Sweden suffered some 400 killed, (amongst them, commander of the Kronoberg Regiment, colonel Gabriel Lillieh√∂√∂k) and 1,000 wounded. Schulenburg managed to escape, despite having suffered a bullet wound to his hip.Slaget vid Fraustadt, Youtube 71 banners, the whole Saxon artillery, 11,000 rapiers and equally as many muskets had also been captured. Rehnski√∂ld executed about 500 Russian prisoners; it is debated whether he did this in retaliation for Russian atrocities in CourlandTucker, S.C., 2010, A Global Chronology of Conflict, Vol. Two, Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, LLC, or because he believed their inside-out coats were an attempt to be recognized as Saxons, who were given better terms in captivity. Hiding your own identity and claiming to be something else was frowned upon at the time, and sometimes considered reason enough to be denied quarter. Analysis The Swedish success in the battle was mainly due to Rehnski√∂ld effectively neutralising the Saxon infantry, who were superior in number at the start of the battle, combined with the pincer movement performed by the Swedish cavalry under Hummerhielm and von Krassow. Schulenburg also made two grave mistakes: first by being lured into terrain not to his advantage and then underestimating the mobility of the Swedish cavalry, especially on the flanks. It is known from Rehnski√∂ld's personal journals that he had intended a double envelopment from the beginning. The Battle of Fraustadt is one of the most classic double envelopments in military history. It is probable that Rehnski√∂ld had studied the Battle of Cannae 216 BC although it is uncertain if he intended to copy it. Aftermath The captured Russians (some 500) were, according to some historians, executed by an order from Rehnski√∂ld, although involvement of the latter has been disputed.Svenska Slagf√§lt, 2003, (Walhlstr√∂m & Widstrand) The authors further quotes Lieutenant Colonel Nils Gyllenstierna of the Norra Sk√•nska cavalry regiment about the fate of the Russian infantry, ‚Äúp√• n√•gra 100 n√§r massakrerat, emedan vi inte i begynnelsen kunde giva kvarter, eftersom v√•r v√§nstra flygel √§nnu stod i full eld‚Äù roughly translated as ‚Äúall but a few hundred were massacred, as initially quarters could not be given, since our left flank was still in full assault‚Äù. From Alexander Magnus Dahlberg's (Dragoon at Buchwalds dragoonregiment) diary: ‚ÄúEtt √§nnu som mig underligit f√∂rekom vil jag h√§r anf√∂ra, nemligen at ingen af de 6000:de ryssar som voro saxerne tilhielp gafs n√•gon pardon, utan blefvo alla masacrerade; de voro alla munderade i hvita r√•ckar med r√∂dt foder, hvaraf n√•gra under flyckten som f√•dt s√• l√•ng tid, v√§ndt om r√•ckarna och det r√∂da fodret ut, fingo pardon i mening at de voro saxar, men sedan general Renschi√∂ld fick veta at de voro ryssar, l√§t han f√∂ra dem f√∂r fronten, och befalte at skiuta dem f√∂r hufvudet, som var r√§tt ett ymkeligt spectacel.‚Äú Roughly translated to: ‚ÄùSomething which I found strange I‚Äôd like to here mention, is that none of the 6000 Russians who were the Saxons help were given any mercy, but were instead all massacred; They were all dressed in white coats with red lining, with some during the retreat having turned their coats inside out to resemble Saxons in hope of mercy, but after General Renschi√∂ld learned they were Russians, he had them taken to the front to be shot in the head.‚Äù The road to Saxony was open for King Charles XII of Sweden. King August II of Poland gave up his claim on the Polish crown, although he remained Elector Frederick Augustus I of Saxony. He would later regain the Polish throne in 1709. The prisoners taken by the Swedes during the battle that were of German, French and Swiss nationality were immediately reorganized into the ranks of the Swedish army. The Saxon prisoners were shipped to Sweden, where they formed a regiment and three battalions. This regiment made a good effort at the Battle of Helsingborg 1710.

It is a widespread and common resident breeder throughout temperate and subarctic Europe and across the Palearctic. The plumage is grey- brown and off-white with a black cap and bib. It is more of a conifer specialist than the closely related marsh tit, which explains it breeding much further north. It is resident, and most birds do not migrate. Taxonomy The willow tit was described in 1827 by the Swiss naturalist Thomas Conrad von Baldenstein under the trinomial name Parus cinereus montanus. The type locality is the mountain forests in the Canton of Grisons, Switzerland. The willow tit is now placed in the genus Poecile that was erected by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1829. The genus name, Poecile, is the Ancient Greek name for a now unidentifiable small bird, and the specific montanus is Latin for \\"of the mountains\\". Poecile was at one time treated as a subgenus within the genus Parus but molecular taxonomic analysis, using both nuclear and mitochondrial genes, supports Poecile as a distinct clade. Within Poecile, most of the Old World species (including the willow tit) form a separate clade from the New World chickadees. The taxonomic analysis has shown that the willow tit is sister to the Caspian tit (Poecile hyrcanus). The willow tit was formerly considered conspecific with the black-capped chickadee of North America due to their very similar appearance. This is seen in an older version of the Peterson Field Guide, Birds of Britain and Europe. Underneath the name it states; \\"N Am. Black-Capped Chickadee\\" as an alternate name. In fact the willow tit, black-capped chickadee, marsh tit and Carolina chickadee are all very similar to one another in appearance. There are 14 recognised subspecies: * P. m. kleinschmidti (Hellmayr, 1900) ‚Äì Britain * P. m. rhenanus (O. Kleinschmidt, 1900) ‚Äì northwest France to west Germany, north Switzerland and north Italy * P. m. montanus (Conrad von Baldenstein, 1827) ‚Äì southeast France to Romania, Bulgaria and Greece * P. m. salicarius (C.

Kleinschmidt, 1921) ‚Äì northeast China The Sichuan tit (Poecile weigoldicus) was formerly treated as a subspecies of the willow tit. It was promoted to species status based on a 2002 phylogenetic analysis that compared DNA sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene. The single locus results were later confirmed by a larger multi-locus analysis published in 2017. Description Subspecies Poecile montanus restrictus in Japan The willow tit is in length, has a wingspan of and weighs around . In the east of its range it is much paler than marsh tit, but as one goes west the various races become increasingly similar, so much so that it was not recognised as a breeding bird in Great Britain until the end of the 19th century, despite being widespread. The willow tit is distinguished from the marsh tit by a sooty brown instead of a glossy blue black cap; the general colour is otherwise similar, though the under parts are more buff and the flanks distinctly more rufous; the pale buff edgings to the secondaries form a light patch on the closed wing. The feathers of the crown and the black bib under the bill are longer, but this is not an easily noticed character. However, the more graduated tail (not square) shows distinctly when spread. The commonest call is a nasal zee, zee, zee, but the notes of the bird evidently vary considerably. Occasionally a double note, ipsee, ipsee, is repeated four or five times. Behaviour and ecology =Breeding= Eggs, collection Museum Wiesbaden, Germany The willow tit excavates its own nesting hole, even piercing hard bark; this is usually in a rotten stump or in a tree, more or less decayed. Most nests examined are cups of felted material, such as fur, hair and wood chips, but feathers are sometimes used. The number of eggs varies from six to nine, with reddish spots or blotches. In a study using ring-recovery data carried out in northern Finland, the survival rate for juveniles for their first year was 0.58, and the subsequent adult annual survival rate was 0.64. For birds that survive the first year the typical lifespan is thus only three years. The maximum recorded age is 11 years; this has been recorded for a bird in Finland and for another near Nottingham in England. =Food and feeding= Birds feed on insects, caterpillars, and seeds, much like other tits. This species is parasitised by the moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae. Status The willow tit has an extremely large range with an estimated population of between 175 and 253 million mature individuals. This large population appears to be slowly decreasing but the decline is not sufficiently rapid to approach the threshold of vulnerability. The species is therefore classed as of least-concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In contrast, the number in the United Kingdom declined by 83% between 1995 and 2017. There was also a contraction in the range. The rapid decline is believed be due to three factors: habitat loss, competition for nest holes by other tits particularly blue tits, and nest predation by the great spotted woodpecker. Over the same period, the number of great spotted woodpeckers increased fourfold.

It was designed by the Soviet Union's Mikoyan-Gurevich bureau and is one of the few combat aircraft built primarily using stainless steel. It was the last plane designed by Mikhail Gurevich before his retirement. The first prototype flew in 1964, and the aircraft entered service in 1970. It has an operational top speed of Mach 2.83 (Mach 3.6 is possible but at risk of significant damage to the aircraft and its engines) and features a powerful radar and four air-to-air missiles. When first seen in reconnaissance photography, the large wings suggested an enormous and highly maneuverable fighter, at a time when U.S. design theories were also evolving towards higher maneuverability due to combat performance in the Vietnam War. The appearance of the MiG-25 sparked serious concern in the West and prompted dramatic increases in performance for the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle then under development in the late 1960s. The capabilities of the MiG-25 were better understood by the west in 1976 when Soviet pilot Viktor Belenko defected in a MiG-25 to the United States via Japan. It turned out that the aircraft's weight necessitated its large wings. Production of the MiG-25 series ended in 1984 after completion of 1,186 aircraft. A symbol of the Cold War, the MiG-25 flew with Soviet allies and former Soviet republics, remaining in limited service in several export customers. It is one of the highest-flying military aircraft, one of the fastest serially produced interceptor aircraft, and the second-fastest serially produced aircraft after the SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft that was built in very small series compared to the MiG-25.\\"Global Aircraft ‚Äì Top 50 Fastest Aircraft.\\" The Global Aircraft Organization, 24 April 2007. Retrieved: 30 June 2011. , the MiG-25 remains the fastest manned serially produced aircraft in operational use and the fastest plane that was offered for supersonic flights and edge-of-space flights to civilian customers. Design and development =Background= During the Cold War, Soviet Air Defence Forces, PVO (not to be confused with Soviet Air Force, VVS) was given the task of strategic air defence of the USSR. In the decades after World War II, this meant not only dealing with accidental border violations, but more importantly defending the vast airspace of the USSR against US reconnaissance aircraft and strategic bombers carrying free-fall nuclear bombs. The performance of these types of aircraft was steadily improved. Overflights by the very high altitude American Lockheed U-2 in the late 1950s revealed a need for higher altitude interceptor aircraft than currently available.Rich and Janos 1994, p. 15. The subsonic Boeing B-47 Stratojet and Boeing B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers were followed by the Mach 2 Convair B-58 Hustler, with the Mach 3 North American B-70 Valkyrie on the drawing board at that time. A major upgrade in the PVO defence system was required, and, at the start of 1958, a requirement was issued for manned interceptors capable of reaching 3,000 km/h (1,864 mph) and heights of up to 27 km (88,583 ft). Mikoyan and Sukhoi responded.Gordon and Gunston 2000, p. 166. YE-152 and YE-152M experimental interceptor The Mikoyan-Gurevich OKB had been working on a series of interceptors during the second half of the 1950s: the I-1, I-3U, I-7U, I-75, Ye-150, Ye-150A, Ye-152, Ye-152A, Ye-152P, and Ye-152M. The Ye-150 was noteworthy because it was built specifically to test the Tumansky R-15 engine, two of which would later be used for the MiG-25. This led to Ye-152, alternatively known as Ye-166, which set several world records.Gordon and Gunston 2000, p. 106. The Ye-152M (converted from one of the two Ye-152 aircraft) was intended to be the definite heavy interceptor design. But before it was finished, the PVO had selected the Tupolev Tu-128. As the work on the MiG-25 was well under way, the single-engine Ye-152M was abandoned. =Designing a new interceptor= Work on the new Soviet interceptor that became the MiG-25 started in mid-1959, a year before Soviet intelligence learned of the American Mach 3 A-12 reconnaissance aircraft.Spick 2000 It is not clear if the design was influenced by the American A-5 Vigilante. The design bureau studied several possible layouts for the new aircraft. One had the engines located side by side, as on the MiG-19. The second had a stepped arrangement with one engine amidships, with exhaust under the fuselage, and another in the aft fuselage. The third project had an engine arrangement similar to that of the English Electric Lightning, with two engines stacked vertically. Option two and three were both rejected because the size of the engines meant any of them would result in a very tall aircraft which would complicate maintenance. The idea of placing the engines in underwing nacelles was also rejected because of the dangers of any thrust asymmetry during flight. Having decided on engine configuration, there was thought of giving the machine variable-sweep wings and a second crew member, a navigator. Variable geometry would improve maneuverability at subsonic speed, but at the cost of decreased fuel tank capacity. Because the reconnaissance aircraft would operate at high speed and high altitude, the idea was soon dropped. Another interesting but impractical idea was to improve the field performance using two RD36-35 lift-jets. Vertical takeoff and landing would allow for use of damaged runways during wartime and was studied on both sides of the Iron Curtain. The perennial problem with engines dedicated to vertical lift is they become mere dead weight in horizontal flight and also occupy space in the airframe needed for fuel. The MiG interceptor would need all the fuel it could get, so the idea was abandoned. Ye-155R3 Reconnaissance prototype with a 5,280-litre drop tank under the belly, 1964 The first prototype was a reconnaissance variant, designated Ye-155-R1, that made its first flight on 6 March 1964.Belyakov and Marmain 1994, p. 398. It had some characteristics that were unique to that prototype, and some of these were visually very evident: the wings had fixed wingtip tanks (600-litre capacity) to which small winglets were attached for stability purposes, but when it was found that fuel sloshing around in the tanks caused vibrations, they were eliminated. The aircraft also had attachments for movable foreplanes, canards, to help with pitch control at high speed (provisions for canards had previously been installed, but not used, on the Ye-152P).Lake 1998, p. 108.Belyakov and Marmain 1994, pp. 272‚Äì274. The first flight of the interceptor prototype, Ye-155-P1, took place on 9 September 1964.Belyakov and Marmain 1994, p. 391. Development of the MiG-25, which represented a major step forward in Soviet aerodynamics, engineering and metallurgy, took several more years to complete.Belyakov and Marmain 1994, pp. 387‚Äì388. On 9 July 1967, the new aircraft was first shown to the public at the Domodedovo air show, with four prototypes (three fighters and a reconnaissance aircraft) making a flypast.Lake 1998, p. 109. Aviation records The Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau soon realized that the performance of the new aircraft gave it great potential to set new flight records. In addition to their normal duties, the prototypes Ye-155-P1, Ye-155-R1, Ye-155-R3 were made lighter by removing some unneeded equipment and were used for these attempts. Under Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI) classification, the Ye-155 type belonged to class C1 (III), which specifies jet-powered land planes with unlimited maximum take-off weight. Records set included: * The first claim was for world speed records with no payload and payloads of 1,000 and 2,000 kilograms. MiG OKB Chief Test Pilot Aleksandr Vasilyevich Fedotov reached an average speed of 2,319.12 km/h over a 1,000 km circuit on 16 March 1965. * For pure speed, with no payload, test pilot Mikhail M. Komarov averaged 2,981.5 km/h over a 500 km closed circuit on 5 October 1967. On the same day, Fedotov reached an altitude of with a 1,000 kilogram payload. The MiG eventually became the first aircraft to go higher than . * Time to height records were recorded on 4 June 1973 when Boris A. Orlov climbed to 20,000 m in 2 min 49.8 s. The same day, Pyotr M. Ostapenko reached 25,000 m in 3 min 12.6 s and 30,000 m in 4 min 3.86 s. * On 25 July 1973, Fedotov reached 35,230 m with 1,000 kg payload and 36,240 m (118,900 feet) with no load (an absolute world record).Belyakov and Marmain 1994, p. 392. In the thin air, the engines flamed out, and the aircraft coasted in a ballistic trajectory by inertia alone. At the apex the speed had dropped to 75 km/h. * On 31 August 1977, Ye-266M again flown by Fedotov, set the recognized absolute altitude record for a jet aircraft under its own power.Belyakov and Marmain 1994, pp. 406‚Äì407. He reached at Podmoskovnoye, USSR in zoom climb (the absolute altitude record is different from the record for sustained altitude in horizontal flight). The aircraft was actually a MiG-25RB re-engined with the powerful R15BF2-300. It had earlier been part of the program to improve the aircraft's top speed that resulted in the MiG-25M prototype. In all, 29 records were claimed, of which seven were all-time world records for time to height, altitudes of 20,000 m and higher, and speed. Several records still stand. Technical description Because of the thermal stresses incurred in flight above Mach 2, the Mikoyan-Gurevich OKB had difficulties choosing what materials to use for the aircraft. They had to use E-2 heat-resistant Plexiglas for the canopy and high-strength stainless steel for the wings and fuselage. Using titanium rather than steel would have been ideal, but it was expensive and difficult to work with. The problem of cracks in welded titanium structures with thin walls could not be solved, so the heavier nickel steel was used instead. It cost far less than titanium and allowed for welding, along with heat-resistant seals.Gordon 2008 The MiG-25 was constructed from 80% nickel-steel alloy, 11% aluminium, and 9% titanium.Eden 2004, p. 308. The steel components were formed by a combination of spot welding, automatic machine welding, and hand arc welding methods. Initially, the interceptor version was equipped with the TL-25 Smerch-A (also referred to as Product 720) radar, a development of the system carried by the earlier Tu-128. While powerful and thus long-ranged and resistant to jamming, the system‚Äîdue to the age of its design and its intended purpose (tracking and targeting high- and fast-flying US bombers and reconnaissance aircraft)‚Äîlacked look-down/shoot-down capability, which limited its effectiveness against low- flying targets. (This is one of the reasons why it was replaced with the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-31, whose Zaslon radar has that capability.) By the time the MiG-25 entered service in 1969, this was a serious shortcoming, as strategic bombing doctrine was shifting towards low-level penetration of enemy territory. After Belenko's defection to Japan exposed this flaw to the West, a government decree issued on 4 November 1976 called for urgent development of a more advanced radar. This resulted in the pulse-Doppler radar Sapphire-25 system fitted to the MiG-25PD variant. As an interceptor, typical armament includes four supersonic (M>5) UR great range R-40T (R-40TD) air-to-air missiles with thermal homing head and R-40P (R-40RD) with semi-active radar guidance system (maximum launch range, on altitudinal goal on a collision course ‚Äì 35‚Äì60 km). A fuel tank can be suspended under the fuselage. The aircraft could carry unguided gravity bombs in a rudimentary strike capability. As the bombs would weigh no more and incur no more drag than its regular load of R-40 missiles, its performance was not impaired, leading to some impressive bombing feats; when released at an altitude of 20,000 m (66,000 ft) and a speed above Mach 2, a 500 kg bomb would have a glide range of several tens of kilometres. The MiG-25 was theoretically capable of a maximum speed of Mach 3+ and a ceiling of . Its high speed was problematic: although sufficient thrust was available to reach Mach 3.2, a limit of Mach 2.83 had to be imposed as the engines tended to overspeed and overheat at higher air speeds, possibly damaging them beyond repair.\\"Intelligence: Big- Mouth Belenko.\\" Time, 11 October 1976. Retrieved: 12 May 2010.Gunston and Spick pp. 132‚Äì133. The design cruising speed is Mach 2.35 (2,500 km/h) with partial afterburner in operation. The maximum speed of Mach 2.83 (3,000 km/h) is allowed to maintain no more than 5 minutes due to the danger of overheating of the airframe and fuel in the tanks. When the airframe temperature reaches 290 C, the warning lamp lights up and the pilot must reduce airspeed. The use of a partial afterburner and a cruising flight altitude 19,000‚Äì21,000 m makes it possible to have a range only 230 km less than when flying Mach 0.9 at altitudes 9,000‚Äì10,000 m. The maximum altitude of flight without an afterburner in operation is 12,000 m.Practical aerodynamics of the MiG-25RB, Military Publishing House of the USSR Ministry of Defense, 1978, p. 88-90 The poor fuel consumption in the subsonic regime, and hence range, is due to the engines having extremely low pressure ratio of just 4.75 at subsonic speeds. Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) of the engines is 1.12 in cruise and 2.45 with afterburners.Soviet Spyplanes of the Cold War, Casemate, Yefim Gordon P.70 For comparison purposes, this is 50% worse in cruise than the first generation of F100 engines from the F-15 Eagle, but the SFC with afterburners is actually nearly equal despite the F100 being a far newer engine design.http://www.jet- engine.net/miltfspec.html =Into production= Surveillance Cameras of the MiG-25RB Full-scale production of the MiG-25R ('Foxbat-B') began in 1969 at the Gorkii aircraft factory (Plant No.21). The MiG-25P (\\"Foxbat-A\\") followed in 1971, and 460 of this variant was built until production ended in 1982. The improved PD variant that replaced it was built from 1978 till 1984 with 104 aircraft completed. Subsequently the Gorkii factory switched over production to the new MiG-31. =Western intelligence and the MiG-25= MiG-25RBSh with markings of 2nd Sqn/47th GvORAP (Guards independent recce Regiment) Inaccurate intelligence analysis caused the West initially to believe the MiG-25 was an agile air-combat fighter rather than an interceptor. In response, the United States started a new program which resulted in the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle.Jenkins 1998, pp. 6‚Äì7. NATO obtained a better understanding of the MiG-25's capabilities on 6 September 1976, when a Soviet Air Defence Forces pilot, Lt. Viktor Belenko, defected, landing his MiG-25P at Hakodate Airport in Japan.Barron 1980, p. 15. The pilot overshot the runway on landing and damaged the front landing gear. Despite Soviet protests, the Japanese invited U.S. Air Force personnel to investigate the aircraft.Barron 1980, p. 131. On 25 September, it was moved by a C-5A transport to a base in central Japan, where it was carefully dismantled and analyzed.Barron 1980, photoplates. After 67 days, the aircraft was returned by ship to the Soviets, in pieces.Barron 1980, p. 180. The aircraft was reassembled and is now on display at the Sokol plant in Nizhny Novgorod. The analysis, based on technical manuals and ground tests of its engines and avionics, revealed unusual technical information: * Belenko's particular aircraft was brand new, representing the latest Soviet technology. * The aircraft was assembled quickly and was essentially built around its massive Tumansky R-15(B) turbojets. * Welding was done by hand. Rivets with non-flush heads were used in areas that would not cause adverse aerodynamic drag. * The aircraft was built of a nickel-steel alloy and not titanium as was assumed (although some titanium was used in heat-critical areas). The steel construction contributed to the craft's high 29,000 kg (64,000 lb) unarmed weight. * Maximum acceleration (g-load) rating was just 2.2 g (21.6 m/s¬≤) with full fuel tanks, with an absolute limit of 4.5 g (44.1 m/s¬≤). One MiG-25 withstood an inadvertent 11.5 g (112.8 m/s¬≤) pull during low-altitude dogfight training, but the resulting deformation damaged the airframe beyond repair.\\"MiG-25.\\" globalaircraft.org. Retrieved: 5 September 2010. * Combat radius was , and maximum range on internal fuel (at subsonic speeds) was only at low altitude (< 1000 metres). * The airspeed indicator was redlined at Mach 2.8, with typical intercept speeds near Mach 2.5 in order to extend the service life of the engines. A MiG-25 was tracked flying over the Sinai Peninsula at Mach 3.2 in the early 1970s, but the flight led to the engines being damaged beyond repair.Barron 1980, pp. 169‚Äì171. * The majority of the on-board avionics were based on vacuum-tube technology, not solid-state electronics. Although they represented aging technology, vacuum tubes were more tolerant of temperature extremes, thereby removing the need for environmental controls in the avionics bays. With the use of vacuum tubes, the MiG-25P's original Smerch-A (Tornado, NATO reporting name \\"Foxfire\\") radar had enormous power ‚Äì about 600 kilowatts. As with most Soviet aircraft, the MiG-25 was designed to be as robust as possible. The use of vacuum tubes also made the aircraft's systems resistant to an electromagnetic pulse, for example after a nuclear blast.Broad, William J. \\"Nuclear Pulse (I): Awakening to the Chaos Factor.\\" Science, Volume 212, 29 May 1981, pp. 1009‚Äì1012. =Later versions= As the result of Belenko's defection and the compromise of the MiG-25P's radar and missile systems, beginning in 1976, the Soviets started to develop an advanced version, the MiG-25PD (\\"Foxbat-E\\"). Plans for a new aircraft to develop the MiG-25's potential to go faster than the in-service limit of Mach 2.8 were designed as a flying prototype. Unofficially designated MiG-25M, it had new powerful engines R15BF2-300, improved radar, and missiles. This work never resulted in a machine for series production, as the coming MiG-31 showed more promise. Operational history =Soviet Union= MiG-25PU The unarmed 'B' version had greater impact than the interceptor when the USSR sent two MiG-25R and two MiG-25RB to Egypt in March 1971, which stayed until July 1972. They were operated by the Soviet 63rd Independent Air Detachment (Det 63), which was established for this mission. Det 63 flew over Israeli-held territory in Sinai on reconnaissance missions roughly 20 times. The flights were in pairs at maximum speed and high altitude, between 17,000 and 23,000 m (55,000 to 75,000 ft). On 6 November 1971, a Soviet MiG-25 operating out of Egypt flying at Mach 2.5 was met by Israeli F-4Es and fired upon unsuccessfully.\\"Foxbats over Sinai.\\" spyflight.co.uk. Retrieved: 5 September 2010. A MiG-25 was tracked flying over Sinai at Mach 3.2 during this period. The MiG-25 engines went into overspeed, which led to them being scrapped. Det 63 was sent back home in 1972. Soviet-operated reconnaissance Foxbats returned to Egypt in 19‚Äì20 October 1973, during the Yom Kippur War. Det 154 remained in Egypt until late 1974. During the 1970s, the Soviet air force conducted reconnaissance overflights across Iran using its MiG-25RBSh aircraft in response to joint US-Iran recon operations. The Swedish Air Force observed Soviet Air Defence MiG-25s via radar regularly performing intercepts at 19,000 m (63,000 ft) and 2.9 km (1.8 mi) behind the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird at 22,000 m (72,000 ft) over the Baltic Sea in the 1980s. =Syria= On 13 February 1981, the Israeli Air Force sent two RF-4Es over Lebanon as decoys for Syrian MiG-25 interceptors. As the MiGs scrambled, the RF-4Es turned back delivering chaff and using ECM pods. Two IDF/AF F-15As were waiting for the MiGs and shot one of them down with AIM-7F missiles. The other MiG was able to escape.Aloni 2006, p. 33. In a similar engagement, on 29 July 1981, a Syrian MiG-25 was again downed by an Israeli F-15A,Aloni 2006, pp. 37‚Äì38.Gordon 1997, p. 53. after which a second MiG-25 launched its R-40 missiles at the F-15 and its wingman, but they missed.Aloni 2006, p. 38. The first reported activity of Syrian MiG-25 aircraft in the civil war was on 8 February 2014, when two Turkish Air Force F-16s were scrambled to intercept a Syrian MiG-25 which was approaching the Turkish border. On 27 March 2014, a MiG-25 was clearly filmed while flying at medium altitude over Hama Eastern countryside, possibly delivering the bomb seen hitting the ground in the same video. =Iraq= A Soviet MiG-25 Iran‚ÄìIraq War All confirmed air-to- air kills of the MiG-25 were made by Iraq. The MiG-25 was in service with the Iraqi Air Force during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. On 19 March 1982 an Iranian F-4E was badly damaged by a missile fired by an Iraqi MiG-25. Iraqi MiG-25s made another kill against Iran in February 1983, when an Iraqi MiG-25PD shot down an Iranian C-130. In April 1984, an Iraqi MiG-25PD shot down an Iranian F-5E. On 21 March 1984, an Iraqi MiG-25PD shot down an Iranian F-4E and on 5 June 1985 an Iraqi MiG-25PD shot down a second Iranian F-4E. On 23 February 1986, an Iraqi MiG-25PD shot down an Iranian EC-130E and on 10 June an RF-4E, later in October 1986, an Iraqi MiG-25PDS shot down a second RF-4E.Mevlutoglu, Arda. \\"Airshow Turkiye 2011.\\" ACIG, 11 June 2011.

For the majority of the air combat Iraqi pilots used R-40 missiles. On 3 May 1981, an Iraqi MiG-25PD shot down an Algerian Gulfstream III. On 2 October 1986, an Iraqi MiG-25PD shot down a Syrian MiG-21RF. According to research by journalist Tom Cooper, at least ten MiG-25s (nine reconnaissance and one fighter) may have been shot down by Iranian F-14s (one of them shared with an F-5) during the Iran-Iraq war.Cooper, Tom and Farzad Bishop.

However the F-15 pilots were able to reacquire the two Iraqi MiG-25s and shot both down with AIM-7 Sparrow missiles. In another incident, an Iraqi MiG-25PD, after eluding eight USAF F-15s at long range, fired three missiles at General Dynamics EF-111A Raven electronic warfare aircraft, forcing them to abort their mission and leave attacking aircraft without electronic jamming support.Atkinson 1993, pp. 125‚Äì126. In a different incident, two MiG-25s approached a pair of F-15s, fired missiles at long range which were evaded by the F-15s, and then outran the American fighters. Two more F-15s joined the pursuit, and a total of 10 air-to-air missiles were fired at the MiG-25s, though none reached them.Atkinson 1993, pp. 230‚Äì231. On 30 January 1991, an IQAF MiG-25 damaged a USAF F-15C by a R-40 missile in the Samurra Air Battle. Iraq claims it was shot down and fell in Saudi Arabia.

During the 1980s, Libya confronted the United States over some claims over the extension of its territorial waters. These incidents prompted a number of encounters between the opposing forces as it happened during the Gulf of Sidra incident (1981) with the Libyan MiG-25s taking part in them. During the following years, the Libyan MiG-25 fleet was grounded, lacking maintenance. As MiG-25 air-frames were grounded for several years, NATO attacks spared them during the Libyan Civil War (2011). In 2014 and 2015, the Libyan forces under the New General National Congress controlled a number of former LARAF air-frames, that were retired and stored before the Libyan Civil War in 2011, among them a number of MiG-25s.

April 1504 - 17 May 1536) was an English courtier and nobleman who played a prominent role in the politics of the early 1530s, and was the brother of Queen Anne Boleyn, from 1533 the second wife of King Henry VIII and thus the maternal uncle of Queen Elizabeth I (whose reign he did not live to see). Following his father's promotion in the peerage in 1529 to Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond, he adopted his father's junior title Viscount Rochford (created in 1525) as a courtesy title. George was however created a baron in his own right between the period 1530 and 1533. G. E. Cokayne, The Complete Peerage (vol XI, \\"Rochford\\", p.51 & vol.IX, appendix B (\\"English baronies created by Henry VIII\\"), p.18 \\"1530, Rochford\\") states that he \\"was Lord Rochford as early as 1530 when he was the second of the barones\\" (Latin) \\"who signed the letter to the Pope\\", and thus \\"presumably had some other form of creation\\" prior to his writ of summons to Parliament dated 5 Feb 1532/3 (vol.IX, appendix B, p.18)- (which automatically creates the addressee a baron in the peerage). However it appears he never dropped the style Viscount in favour of the junior rank of baron, which would have been a humiliation He was accused of incest with his sister Anne during the period of her trial for high treason, as a result of which both were executed. Early years and family George was the only son of Sir Thomas Boleyn, later Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Howard, the daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk and Elizabeth Tilney. George and his sisters were probably born in Norfolk at his family's home of Blickling Hall. However, they spent most of their childhood at another of the family's homes, Hever Castle in Kent, which became their chief residence in 1505 when Thomas inherited the property from his father, Sir William Boleyn. Thomas and Elizabeth had a number of children, including two sons named Thomas and Henry who failed to reach adulthood. Three children survived: Mary, Anne and George. There has been much debate over the centuries as to the age of the three Boleyn siblings, but there is general agreement that George was born c. 1504. This stems from a number of different sources. George Cavendish says in a poem that George was about 27 when he gained a place on the Privy Council in 1529. Cavendish gives this as a maximum age in order to make his tortuous verses more rhythmic (such as \\"thrice nine\\"). In addition to Cavendish's verses, foreign diplomats believed George was too young to be appointed as Ambassador to France in October 1529. Mary's date of birth is again generally accepted as being c. 1500 but there is some disagreement as to Anne's date of birth with arguments for 1501 and others for 1507.The current academic debate on Queen Anne's birth is focused on two very different dates: 1501 and 1507. See for the arguments favouring the earlier date and for arguments favouring 1507. However, following the executions of Anne and George in 1536 their father wrote to Thomas Cromwell and in his letter he stated that upon his marriage his wife gave him a child every year. As Thomas and Elizabeth were married between 1498 and 1499, if Thomas is to be believed this indicates that all five Boleyn children, including the two who failed to reach adulthood, were born between 1500 and 1504, and if we accept as the evidence suggests that George was born in 1504 this is persuasive evidence for suggesting he was the youngest Boleyn child. This is the current thinking of the vast majority of modern historians with only one notable exception.For arguments favouring George as the youngest child, see ; ; ; ; ; . For arguments favouring Anne as the youngest child see Like his father, it was understood that George would have a career as a courtier, politician and diplomat. The monarchy was the font of all patronage and potential wealth and it was only through service to the Royal Family that a family could hope to achieve or protect their greatness and social position. With this in mind, George was introduced to Henry VIII's court at the age of ten, when he attended the Christmas festivities of 1514‚Äì15. He attended an indoor melee with his father and acted in a mummery with his father, and the much older Charles Brandon and Nicholas Carew. Thanks to his family's influence and the fact he obviously impressed Henry at an early age, he became one of the King's pageboys shortly afterwards. Since learning was highly praised at Court and essential for a career as a diplomat, George received an excellent education, speaking fluent French together with some Italian and Latin. His two sisters are known to have been educated abroad (Mary from 1514 to 1519, Anne from the spring of 1513 to late 1521). George is thought to have remained in England throughout his early years, although George's first biographer suggests George may have spent time in France as a child when his father was on embassy from January 1519, as an explanation for how George could speak such perfect French from a young age, and why Anne and George remained so close during their formative years. However, this is pure speculation. Whatever the case, there is a long-standing tradition that George attended the University of Oxford when he was not in attendance at Court, although he does not appear in any of the university's records ‚Äì a relatively frequent occurrence in the period before the English Civil War, when few of the aristocrats who attended either technically matriculated or graduated. Personal life George Boleyn's signature Less is known about George's personal life than about his celebrated court career, but what is known is that he married Jane Parker sometime during 1524. They were certainly married by January 1526 because a note of that date in Cardinal Thomas Wolsey's hand confirms that an extra ¬£20 a year had been awarded to \\"young Boleyn for him and his wife to live on\\". There has always been much speculation as to whether the marriage of George and Jane was happy but there is no way to know for certain, as the state papers are virtually silent with regard to Jane. There is no mention of the couple having any children, which as the brother-in-law and sister-in-law to the king, there surely would have been had such a child existed. It had been thought that George Boleyn, dean of Lichfield, may have been their son; but it is more likely that he was a distant cousin. There is no record of the couple having a child, and Jane makes no mention of a child for whom she is responsible when she wrote a begging letter to Cromwell following George's death. Jane's letter to Cromwell Whether or not the marriage of George and Jane was happy, George had a reputation as a womaniser. George Cavendish, gentleman usher to Cardinal Wolsey, in his poetry entitled Metrical Visions lambastes the young man for his womanising, saying: :I forced widows, maidens I did deflower. :All was one to me, I spared none at all, :My appetite was all women to devour :My study was both day and hour. Yet in the same poem Cavendish, who was a staunch Catholic and hated the Boleyns and what they stood for, acknowledges George's good looks and intelligence, saying: :God gave me grace, dame nature did her part, :Endowed me with gifts of natural qualities: :Dame eloquence also taught me the art :In meter and verse to make pleasant ditties. Likewise Thomas Wyatt in his poetry also recognises George's \\"Great wit\\" (although wit in the 16th century could suggest that a person was witty and charming, it mainly meant intelligence, and it is George's intelligence that Cavendish and Wyatt were referring to.) Wyatt's verse with respect to George reads: :Some say, 'Rochford, haddest thou not been so proud :For thou great wit each man would thee bemoan :Since it is so, many cry aloud :it is a great loss that thou art dead and gone. CXLIX Historian David Starkey recognised George's intellect when he referred to him as having \\"many of Anne's talents and all of her pride\\". For all George's good looks and talent, as can be seen from the above verse, Wyatt, who was a friend of the Boleyns', also says that George was too proud. Although Wyatt's poem is often used to suggest George was hated for his arrogance, there is nothing to support this. Despite George's pride, Wyatt acknowledges that at his death many considered his death to be a great loss. It may also be that the allegations of George's womanising are exaggerated, since there was no scandal surrounding the Boleyns' marriage, and none of the Boleyns' enemies felt that George's behaviour towards women was base enough to comment on. Likewise, neither Cavendish nor the Imperial Ambassador, Eustace Chapuys, who was actively looking for faults in order to demonise the Boleyns, make any mention of him being particularly arrogant. Chapuys' only complaint was that George could not resist entering into Lutheran discussion whenever he was being entertained by him. One modern historian, Retha Warnicke, believes that the men accused of being Anne's lovers were chosen because of ambiguity over their sexuality. This has led to an increasingly enduring myth that the men were charged with sodomy as well as treason. In fact, none of them were charged with sodomy, and there were no extant rumours of homosexuality relating to any of them.A schedule of the charges against the four commoners and the Boleyns are contained in the Baga de Secretis, in . Warnicke's theory was put forth in her 1989 biography of Anne Boleyn, but has been criticised by many other historians for lack of evidence to substantiate it. However, more recently Alison Weir has resurrected the theory regarding George's sexuality by using the same arguments that Warnicke used 20 years previously. In addition to this, Weir also suggests that by his use of the phrase forced widows, Cavendish was insinuating that George was a rapist. As with the theory of George's sexuality, there is no evidence to support the notion that he was a rapist. If he had been guilty of the criminal offences of rape or homosexuality, and if Cavendish knew about it, then so did the rest of the court. Yet no one ever commented on George's supposed bisexuality, or even hinted at it, not even enemies of the Boleyns, such as Chapuys. Metrical Visions are Cavendish's interpretation of George's scaffold speech, when George said he was \\"a wretched sinner deserving of death\\".There are many different versions of George's scaffold speech, but they all follow the basic contents. It can be found in Wriothesley's Chronicle, pp. 39‚Äì40, Thomas, The Pilgrim, pp. 116‚Äì117, Chronicle of Calais, pp. 46‚Äì47 and Constantine in Archaeologia 23, pp. 64-66. But the most detailed version of it is at Bentley, Excerpta Historica, pp. 261-265 Despite the current enthusiasm for believing that Cavendish was referring to homosexuality, his 16th-century interpretation was that George was apologising for his promiscuity, of which he may or may not have been guilty. To use Metrical Visions and George's scaffold speech as the lone pieces of evidence to support an argument for homosexual behaviour is problematic. The verses in Metrical Visions are based merely on Cavendish's interpretation of George's scaffold speech, with Warnicke and Weir solely re- interpreting George's final words on the basis of Cavendish's writings. Appointments and career George is first mentioned as an adult in 1522 when he and his father received a joint grant of various manor houses in Kent. The grant was made in April, suggesting that George was born in April 1504 and that this grant was an 18th birthday gift. He received the first grant in his sole name in 1524, when at the age of 20 he received from the King a country mansion, Grimston Manor. It is supposed that this was an early wedding present made to a young man who was rapidly coming into favour. He was a firm favourite of the King and is regularly mentioned in the Privy Purse expenses as playing the King at bowls, tennis, card games and archery. He also hunted with the King and bet large sums of money with him. He won huge sums off the King but probably lost just as much, if not more. Gambling was one of the European aristocracy's favourite pastimes in the period. In 1525, George was appointed gentleman of the Privy Chamber, functioning as the male equivalent to the King of what a lady-in-waiting was to the Queen. As part of a reorganisation of the Court structure, known as the Eltham Ordinance, Cardinal Wolsey, an opponent of the Boleyns, ensured that George lost this position six months later when he halved the number of gentlemen in the Privy Chamber. Wolsey used the reorganisation to get rid of those whom he perceived as a threat, which was something of a backhanded compliment to the 21-year-old Boleyn whose court prominence was already being acknowledged. As compensation, George was appointed Royal Cupbearer in January 1526 in addition to his award of an additional ¬£20 a year for him and his wife to live on. Following her return to England in 1519, Mary Boleyn became Henry VIII's mistress. It is not known when that relationship started or when it ended or indeed for how long it lasted. It was certainly over by 1526 when the King's eyes turned to another Boleyn sibling, Anne, and by 1527 he was seeking to marry her. Much of George Boleyn's career was in furtherance to the king's desire for a divorce from his first wife to enable him to marry Anne. In June 1528, George contracted the disease known as sweating sickness whilst with the King and Catherine of Aragon at Waltham Abbey. In a letter to Anne, who also contracted the disease while at Hever Castle, Henry told her of her brother's illness and recovery. Later that year, George was appointed Esquire of the Body and Master of the Buckhounds in 1528. Throughout the late 1520s grants continued to be bestowed upon him. On 15 November 1528 he became keeper of the Palace of Beaulieu and on 1 February 1529 was appointed chief steward of Beaulieu (later in October 1533 he would be granted a life interest in the Palace). On 29 July 1529 he was appointed Governor of Bethlehem Hospital (Bedlam), which was a profitable sinecure. George's diplomatic career took off in late 1529 when he was knighted and regained his former position as a member of the Privy chamber. It was also in December 1529 that he became known by the courtesy title of Viscount Rochford when his father was created Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond, and undertook his first assignment as a diplomat to France as ambassador. Because of his youth, (he was only 25), it is believed that Anne's influence secured him this post, although there is no evidence that he lacked the ability to undertake the role. The French ambassador, Jean du Bellay, commented that George was considerably younger than many of the other foreign diplomats and that the appointment of a man barely out of his teens would cause amusement. But he also goes on to say that George should be shown more honour than was ordinarily necessary, and that his reception would be well weighted. Irrespective of his age, George quickly established a good relationship with King Francis I of France and did well in his first embassy. George attended a total of six foreign embassies to France. The first was between late October 1529 and late February 1530. George attended with John Stokesley, the Dean of the Chapel Royal. Their mission was to encourage the universities of France to support Henry VIII's divorce from Catherine of Aragon. The universities' response was initially negative, but George encouraged King Francis to write a strong letter in favour of the divorce, which was later used to reverse the universities' decision. Royal badge of Queen Anne Boleyn The second was in March 1533 when he informed the King of France of his sister's marriage to the King of England. George was also instructed to encourage Francis into giving Henry more support, and following a lengthy debate George succeeded in obtaining a letter from Francis asking the Pope to concede to Henry's wishes. Not everyone was happy with George's success. The Bishop of Paris, who had found George's youth so amusing, described him as \\"the most unreasonable young man who ever crossed the sea\\". Yet despite the criticism Du Bellay grudgingly gave praise for the respect George Boleyn inspired at the meeting and the strength with which he argued the case. George's third embassy was between May and August 1533 when he travelled to France with his uncle the Duke of Norfolk to be present at a proposed meeting between the King of France and Pope Clement VII. It was during this mission that news reached them that the Pope had excommunicated Henry. It was George who returned to England to inform Henry of the Pope's actions. On 10 September 1533, George carried the canopy over his royal niece the Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth I) at her christening, along with his uncles Lord Thomas Howard and William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham as well as John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford. His fourth embassy was in April 1534 when George was again appointed to encourage the French King to give more support to Henry's cause, to pass similar legislation against the Pope as had been passed in England, and to arrange a meeting between the two Kings and Anne. In July 1534, George once again attended the French court, this time to rearrange the meeting that had been arranged between the kings as a result of Anne's pregnancy (she later miscarried). In George's instructions is a passage stating he is one who the King \\"specially loveth and trustith\\". George's final embassy was in May 1535 when he and his uncle were appointed by the King to negotiate a marriage contract between the King of France's third son and the baby Princess Elizabeth, George's niece. When George was not abroad, he often escorted foreign diplomats and ambassadors into the King's presence. Chapuys in particular regularly refers in his dispatches to meeting \\"the ladies brother\\". In October 1529, immediately prior to George's first embassy abroad, he was instructed to escort Chapuys on his first audience with the King. Chapuys refers to meeting \\"a civil gentleman named Boleyn\\". Ironically, Chapuys had liked George, before he became aware of who he was. In addition to his diplomatic career, George was an acknowledged court poet of considerable merit, and was also much admired as a talented linguist and translator. He was passionate about religious reform and translated from French into English two magnificent religious texts as presents for his sister Anne, which he dedicates \\"To the right honourable lady, the Lady Marchiness of Pembroke, her most loving and friendly brother sendeth greetings.\\"MS 6561, fol. iv. MS 6561, fol. 2r. The translations codify the Lutheran doctrine which both Anne and George were so immersed in, and emphasise the joint commitment of both siblings to reform of the Church. When Anne was sent a religious pamphlet by Simon Fish, \\"A Supplication for the Beggars\\", it was George, according to Fish's wife, who encouraged Anne to show it to the King. In matters of religion Anne and George Boleyn were very much a team. Though Anne had far greater influence owing to the King's infatuation with her, her brother clearly identified both of them with the new religious ideas.For an overview of George's influence see George's own religious views resulted in him having an influential role in the Reformation Parliament between its conception in late 1529 and his death in 1536. Both siblings were talented debaters on the issues of religious philosophy and it was George whom Henry chose in 1531 to argue the case for royal supremacy over the Church, before the Church's advisory body, Convocation. On 5 February 1533, George was formally called to Parliament and his attendance rate was higher than any other Lord despite his other onerous duties, clearly indicating his commitment. He obviously voted in favour of the statutes which brought to an end the Pope's powers in England, and his commitment to religious reform earned him many enemies who held true to the Catholic faith. Various peers who were opposed to the legislation were excused attendance provided they appoint a proxy. George twice held the proxy vote of Thomas West, 9th Baron De La Warr, an adherent to the old religion. Unfortunately for George, De La Warr later sat on the jury which tried him. In 1535 he was one of the special commissioners at the trial of Sir Thomas More and at the trial of three Carthusian Monks, all of whom, because of their religious convictions, refused to swear allegiance to the Act of Succession and Supremacy which had been passed the previous year. George, his father, the King's illegitimate son Henry Fitzroy and all other courtiers of rank were present at the monks' executions, which took place on 4 May 1535. In June 1534, George was appointed Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and Constable of Dover Castle. These were the highest appointments in the realm and, as usual, he committed to them with zeal. He is regularly referred to in the State Papers in his position as Warden sitting at the Warden's court at Dover. From Thomas Cromwell's point of view, George's influence as Lord Warden was a thorn in his side. On 26 November 1534, George wrote to Cromwell expressing fury that Cromwell had undermined one of his orders made as Lord Warden. Trial and execution: 1536 In 1536, Anne Boleyn miscarried a son. Her failure to provide Henry with a male heir coincided with Henry's infatuation with Jane Seymour, one of his wife's maids-of-honour. To rid himself of his wife, Henry and his chief advisor, Thomas Cromwell, devised a plot whereby Anne was accused of adultery with five men, one of whom was her brother, George. George was charged with incest with the Queen and plotting with Anne to kill the King. During a conversation with Chapuys following the Boleyns' deaths, Cromwell boasted that he had gone to a great deal of trouble arranging the plot, suggesting he did so in order to assist an alliance with Spain. Yet despite his boasts, during the same conversation he greatly praised both Anne and her brother for their \\"sense, wit, and courage\\".Calendar of State Papers, Spain 5(2), 61, and footnote 1 On 23 April 1536 George was expected to be chosen to receive the Order of the Garter, but the honour went to a known opponent of the Boleyns instead, Sir Nicholas Carew. The following day, Henry gave instructions to Cromwell to set up a special commission looking into various treasons. Anne and George were arrested on 2 May 1536, the day after the May Day joust at which George was one of the principal jousters. The four others implicated in the plot, Sir Henry Norris, Sir Francis Weston, Sir William Brereton, and Mark Smeaton were tried on Friday 12 May. Only Smeaton confessed, probably after torture, but certainly emotional pressure. Despite lack of evidence all four men were found guilty. Thomas Boleyn sat on the jury and effectively condemned his own daughter by finding the men guilty. Anne was pre-judged for the earlier convictions of the men found guilty of adultery with her; therefore she stood trial before her brother. George stood trial a few hours after Anne on Monday 15 May. As Anne had been found guilty before George had stood trial, he too was pre-judged because he could hardly be acquitted when his sister had already been found guilty of incest. The order of the trials had been very cleverly arranged to ensure the difficult case against George could not realistically fail. Everyone who witnessed George's trial, including the Imperial Ambassador Eustace Chapuys, confirmed that he put up a magnificent defence and many thought that he would be acquitted. Chapuys confirmed that those watching were betting 10 to 1 that he would be acquitted, and the court chronicler Charles Wriothesley said that his evidence was a marvel to hear.Calendar of State Papers, Spain, 5(2), 55 There was no evidence of incest save that on one occasion he had spent a long time alone with Anne. Chapuys says he was convicted merely on a presumption. George's wife has throughout history been accused of providing evidence to support the incest charge, but this is unlikely to be correct. None of the evidence relating to the trials makes any mention of George's wife as providing evidence save for the fact that she told in a letter that Anne had told her Henry was \\"not able to satisfy a woman and he had neither capacity nor virility\\". This in itself was damning because it provided a potential motive for Anne's behaviour. Yet whatever Jane Rochford may or may not have said, it seems that the majority of the courtiers believed in his innocence, as can be seen from the wagers they were making in favour of acquittal. Irrespective of what those at court thought, he was unanimously found guilty and the sentence of the court was that he be hanged, drawn, and quartered (the sentence was later commuted to beheading). He asked for his debts be paid out of his confiscated assets so that no one would suffer from his death, and he continued to be distressed about his debts whilst awaiting death. In fact his distress was so acute that the Constable of the Tower, Sir William Kingston wrote to Cromwell twice begging him to help ease George's conscience. George Boleyn and the other four men were beheaded on Tower Hill on the morning of 17 May 1536. George's scaffold speech was extremely long and exemplified the orator's linguistic skills. For it to have been recorded in as much detail as it was, the vast crowd who witnessed the executions must have been virtually silent, and there could have been little booing or jeering as with normal state executions. His scaffold speech was primarily concerned with defending his religious beliefs and his passion for reform. It was not the honourable thing to deny guilt once a guilty verdict had been given in a court of law, and therefore he followed the conventions of the day by admitting he was a sinner deserving of death. He begged forgiveness of anyone he may have offended and begged for God's forgiveness. He came close to denying his guilt by declaring, \\"beware, trust not in the vanity of the world or the flatteries of the court, or the favour and treacheries of fortune\\". He said he would be alive if he had not done so. By blaming fortune for his fall he came as close as he dared to denying his guilt (i.e., he was dying because luck had been against him, not because he was guilty). He then went on to speak of his religious convictions before calmly submitting his neck to the axe. Anne was beheaded two days later. Titles * George Boleyn (1504‚Äì1529) * Sir George Boleyn (c.

The Viscount Rochford (by courtesy until 5 February 1533) (8 December 1529 ‚Äì May 1536) Fictional portrayals George Boleyn is portrayed by Michael Johnson in the 1969 film Anne of the Thousand Days and by Jonathan Newth in the 1970 television series The Six Wives of Henry VIII. Following his prominence within The Other Boleyn Girl, the 2001 novel by Philippa Gregory, he was portrayed in 2003 television film The Other Boleyn Girl by Steven Mackintosh and by Jim Sturgess in the 2008 theatrical film The Other Boleyn Girl. Gregory portrayed George Boleyn as at least gay and possibly bisexual. However, the film adaptations of the book does not portray George as bisexual. Boleyn was portrayed by P√°draic Delaney in the television series The Tudors. The writers of The Tudors not only portrayed George as bisexual, but also portrayed his relationship with his wife as abusive. George Boleyn is one of two protagonists (along with sister Anne) in a play by British writer Joanna Carrick, Fallen in Love. It was originally produced in 2011 in the grounds of Gippeswyk Hall in Suffolk, United Kingdom, and subsequently reprised for performances at the Tower of London and Gippeswyk Hall in May 2013, directed by Carrick as artistic director of Red Rose Chain theatre company. In the 2013 production, George was portrayed by Scott Ellis and Anne by Emma Connell. In the 1830 tragic opera Anna Bolena by Gaetano Donizetti, the character of Lord Rochfort is based on George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford. In the 2015 BBC Two adaptation of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall, George Boleyn is portrayed by Edward Holcroft.

The title character is Dr. Ethan Urquhart, Chief of Biology at the Sevarin District Reproduction Centre on the planet Athos, who is sent to find out what happened to a shipment of vital ovarian tissue cultures. Set in the fictional universe of Bujold's Vorkosigan Saga, the novel mentions but does not feature her usual protagonist Miles Vorkosigan. To date, Bujold has never revisited the settings of Athos or Kline Station in her many subsequent novels, but the events of Ethan of Athos are later referred to indirectly in the novels Borders of Infinity (1989) and Cetaganda (1995). Bujold had written her first novel Shards of Honor and its sequel The Warrior's Apprentice ‚Äî both unpublished ‚Äî when she wrote Ethan of Athos, a standalone work that was purposely short \\"because the current cargo-cult rumor amongst the wanna-be- published back then was that editors would be more likely to read a short manuscript.\\" All three novels were subsequently sold, and published in 1986. Bujold named Athos, a planet founded and maintained as an exclusively male- populated colony with a planetary religion and ideology supporting this single-sex structure, after the Greek Mount Athos, which has prohibited the entry of women for religious reasons since even before the ban was officially proclaimed by the Byzantine emperor Constantine Monomachos in 1046. Ethan of Athos has been reprinted several times, and appeared in the 2001 Bujold omnibus Miles, Mystery and Mayhem alongside Cetaganda and the novella \\"Labyrinth\\". The novel was released on audio cassette in September 1999 narrated by Michael Hanson and Carol Cowan, and as a digital audiobook in March 2009 narrated by Grover Gardner. Plot summary Dr. Ethan Urquhart, Chief of Biology at the Sevarin District Reproduction Centre on Athos, is upset to find that his long-awaited shipment of ovarian tissue cultures from off-planet consists of an unusable mixture of dead and animal tissues. An exclusively male-populated planetary colony, continuing reproduction on Athos relies on uterine replicator technology, but the centuries-old cultures introduced by the original colonists have recently begun deteriorating into senescence. With their entire shipment purchased from the planet Jackson's Whole inexplicably consisting of genetic trash, the Population Council of Athos sends a reluctant Ethan offworld in search of a fresh batch of tissue cultures and (if possible) a refund from the original supplier, House Bharaputra. This is a very daring assignment as it means contact with women, who Athosians are taught are demonic and terrifying. Ethan arrives at the interstellar hub of Kline Station and immediately encounters his first woman, Commander Elli Quinn, a rather unorthodox intelligence officer with the Dendarii Free Mercenary Fleet (and a subordinate of Admiral Naismith's). Though she is pleasant and even helpful, Ethan is wary of her. He is soon abducted and interrogated by military agents from Cetaganda who are seeking a fugitive named Terrence Cee as well as their own lost tissue cultures. They refuse to believe that Ethan is not an opposing intelligence operative. Elli rescues Ethan from certain execution. They become reluctant allies as Elli explains that she has actually been hired by House Bharaputra to track the Cetagandans, and for her own reasons determine what their interest is in the tissue cultures and how it relates to a secret Cetagandan research project. Terrence approaches Ethan with a request for asylum, revealing himself to be the last survivor of a Cetagandan genetic project to create telepaths. Although his telepathy is reliable, it has a small range and can only be triggered for a short amount of time by ingesting large doses of the amino acid tyramine. Terrance‚Äôs female counterpart, Janine, had been killed in their escape, but he managed to preserve her body and transport it to Jackson's Whole, where he paid House Bharaputra to splice her genes into the ovarian cultures that were intended for Athos. Terrence had planned to also emigrate to Athos with the cultures, but had been delayed on his way to Kline Station, and is now horrified to learn that the cultures were stolen and replaced by the useless material that ultimately arrived on Athos. The Cetagandans had tracked Terrence to Jackson's Whole; arriving after his departure, they had killed the Bharaputra researchers who had worked with him and destroyed their records. They then traced the tissue shipment to Kline Station, knowing Terrence would eventually come for it, though they have no knowledge of what happened to the original cultures and are desperate to reclaim them. Elli and Ethan manage to have the Cetagandans seized by Kline Station security, just as they discover that a minor official at the station had, for petty personal reasons, \\"thrown out\\" the Bharaputran tissue cultures that contained Janine's genes and replaced them with the useless biological material. Elli attempts to recruit Terrence for the Dendarii; he refuses, but gives Elli a small genetic sample. Meanwhile, Ethan asks Elli for (and receives) one of her ovaries to create a new tissue culture. After her departure, the original Bharaputran shipment unexpectedly turns up intact and usable, not destroyed. Ethan buys a new set of ovarian cultures from Beta Colony anyway as a cover, uses their packaging to relabel the cultures with Janine's genes, and returns with them and Terrence to Athos. =Athos= In the novel, the planet Athos is an all- male colony with a self-sustaining economy that is virtually independent of interstellar trade. Called a \\"monastery\\" planet by Bujold, it had been settled some 200 years earlier as a sanctuary away from women, who have since become mythologized as \\"demonic\\" due to the \\"madness\\" they cause in men. With the planetary religion and ideology supporting this single-sex structure, all incoming information is screened so that all references to ‚Äî and images of ‚Äî women are removed. Athos is remote, and physical contact with the rest of human civilization is limited to an annual interstellar census courier that brings information, supplies and the rare immigrant. The population is sustained using uterine replicator technology. Nine reproduction centers across the planet possess an assortment of ovarian tissue cultures, and by design only male children are conceived. Through military and community service, Athosians earn \\"Social Duty Credits\\" towards reproduction. Regulations also allow for a \\"Designated Alternate Parent\\" who can earn Social Duty Credits by coparenting a partner's sons. Homosexuality is generally the norm on Athos, and while partnerships are typically romantic and sexual, some are merely mutually beneficial arrangements based on finances and child- rearing. As much as Athosians are innately misogynistic, homophobia still exists elsewhere in the universe and is sometimes casually directed at the population of Athos. Athos is named after the Greek Mount Athos monastery where no females, including female animals, are allowed. Critical reception Saying that \\"it would be hard to imagine a more unlikely hero for an SF adventure novel than a homosexual obstetrician,\\" Booklist called Ethan of Athos \\"Bujold's third remarkable novel in a year\\" with \\"a compellingly attractive protagonist\\", going on to declare the novel \\"highly recommended for all SF collections.\\" Noting that Ethan of Athos is nothing like Bujold's previous two books, Jo Walton wrote of the novel: Walton also writes that \\"I couldn't have imagined what a feminist notion a planet of men is, and how tied up with nurturing children Athos is, accounting for the costs in a way that doesn't dismiss it as 'women‚Äôs work.'\\" Library Journal noted that \\"the plot- driven story moves swiftly and will engage SF fans of all subgenres\\". Nicki Gerlach of SF Site wrote, \\"Bujold's got an uncanny ability to create multidimensional, flawed, and loveable characters in a very short space. Even though Ethan is almost painfully na√Øve throughout the book, it's hard not to sympathize with him and cheer for him right from the beginning.\\" She also praises Bujold's dialogue, which blends humor and \\"snarky wit\\" with \\"the action, the politics, and the emotional pathos that make up the rest of the story.\\" Gerlach also praises Bujold's deftness at \\"introducing more serious topics in her fiction, without having the story become entirely about The Issues.\\" She writes: See also * LGBT themes in speculative fiction * Reproduction and pregnancy in speculative fiction * Sex and sexuality in speculative fiction References External links * 1986 American novels 1986 science fiction novels American science fiction novels LGBT speculative fiction novels Novels by Lois McMaster Bujold Novels with gay themes Single-gender worlds Space opera novels Vorkosigan Saga 1980s LGBT novels American LGBT novels ","title":"Ethan of Athos"},{"id":"247968","title":"Timeline of operating systems"},{"id":"247969","text":"Eurasian blue tit in Sweden, April 2018 The Eurasian blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) is a small passerine bird in the tit family, Paridae. It is easily recognisable by its blue and yellow plumage and small size. Eurasian blue tits, usually resident and non-migratory birds, are widespread and a common resident breeder throughout temperate and subarctic Europe and the western Palearctic in deciduous or mixed woodlands with a high proportion of oak. They usually nest in tree holes, although they easily adapt to nest boxes where necessary. Their main rival for nests and in the search for food is the larger and more common great tit. The Eurasian blue tit prefers insects and spiders for its diet. Outside the breeding season, they also eat seeds and other vegetable-based foods. The birds are famed for their acrobatic skills, as they can cling to the outermost branches and hang upside down when looking for food.  Taxonomy  The Eurasian blue tit was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Parus caeruleus. Parus is the classical Latin for a tit and caeruleus is the Latin for dark blue or cerulean. Two centuries earlier, before the introduction of the binomial nomenclature, the same Latin name had been used by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner when he described and illustrated the blue tit in his Historiae animalium of 1555. In 2005, analysis of the mtDNA cytochrome b sequences of the Paridae indicated that Cyanistes was an early offshoot from the lineage of other tits, and more accurately regarded as a genus rather than a subgenus of Parus. The current genus name, Cyanistes, is from the Ancient Greek , \\"dark blue\\". The African blue tit (Cyanistes teneriffae) was formerly considered conspecific. = Subspecies = There are currently at least nine recognised subspecies: * C. c. caeruleus ‚Äì (Linnaeus, 1758): the nominate subspecies, occurring in Continental Europe to northern Spain, Sicily, northern Turkey and northern Urals * C. c. obscurus ‚Äì (Pra≈æ√°k, 1894): found in Ireland, Britain and Channel Islands * C. c. ogliastrae ‚Äì (Hartert, 1905): found in Portugal, southern Spain, Corsica and Sardinia * C. c. balearicus ‚Äì (von Jordans, 1913): found on Majorca Island (Balearic Islands) * C. c. calamensis ‚Äì (Parrot, 1908): found in southern Greece, Pelop√≥nnisos, Cyclades, Crete and Rhodes * C. c. orientalis ‚Äì Zarudny & Loudon, 1905: found in southern European Russia (Volga River to central and southern Urals) * C. c. satunini ‚Äì Zarudny, 1908: found in the Crimean Peninsula, Caucasus, Transcaucasia and northwestern Iran to eastern Turkey * C. c. raddei ‚Äì Zarudny, 1908: found in northern Iran * C. c. persicus ‚Äì (Blanford, 1873): found in the Zagros Mountains = Hybrids = Pleske's tit (Cyanistes pleskei) is a common hybrid between this species and the azure tit, in western Russia. The cap is usually darker than the azure tit, and the tail is paler than the Eurasian blue tit.  Description  The Eurasian blue tit is usually , long with a wingspan of for both sexes, and weighs about . A typical Eurasian blue tit has an azure-blue crown and dark blue line passing through the eye, and encircling the white cheeks to the chin, giving the bird a very distinctive appearance. The forehead and a bar on the wing are white. The nape, wings and tail are blue and the back is yellowish green. The underparts is mostly sulphur-yellow with a dark line down the abdomen‚Äîthe yellowness is indicative of the number of yellowy-green caterpillars eaten, due to high levels of carotene pigments in the diet. The bill is black, the legs bluish grey, and the irides dark brown. The sexes are similar, but under ultraviolet light, males have a brighter blue crown. Young blue tits are noticeably more yellow.  Distribution and habitat  Reported range from observations reported to eBird There are currently around 20‚Äì44 million pairs in Europe. The Eurasian blue tit and the related hybrids are considered native species in areas of the European continent with a mainly temperate or Mediterranean climate, and in parts of the Middle East. These areas include Ireland, the United Kingdom and most of the European Union and EFTA (except Malta, where they are considered vagrant, and Iceland, where they are absent), plus: Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Libya, the Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, Russia, San Marino, Serbia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, Vatican City and Ukraine. In Great Britain the Eurasian blue tit is typically found in deciduous woodland, parks, gardens and even in the centre of towns.  Behaviour and ecology  Juvenile in Pimlico, London Eurasian blue and great tits form mixed winter flocks, and the former are perhaps the better gymnasts in the slender twigs. A Eurasian blue tit will often ascend a trunk in short jerky hops, imitating a treecreeper. As a rule the bird roosts in ivy or evergreens, but in harsh winters will nest wherever there is a suitable small hole, be it in a tree or nesting box. They are very agile and can hang from almost anywhere. This is a common and popular European garden bird, due to its perky acrobatic performances when feeding on nuts or suet. It swings beneath the holder, calling \\"tee, tee, tee\\" or a scolding \\"churr\\". = Breeding = The Eurasian blue tit will nest in any suitable hole in a tree, wall, or stump, or an artificial nest box, often competing with house sparrows or great tits for the site. Few birds more readily accept the shelter of a nesting box; the same hole is returned to year after year, and when one pair dies another takes possession. It is estimated by the RSPB that there are 3,535,000 breeding pairs in the UK. During the incubation period, female blue tits perform most, if not all, of the incubation, however the male feeds the female during this time, with both female nest attendance and male feeding rate higher in the morning, declining throughout the day. Eggs are long and wide. Egg size appears to depend mostly on the size of individual females and secondarily on habitat, with smaller eggs found at higher altitudes. The clutch's total weight can be 1.5 times as heavy as the female bird. A study found that the timing of breeding in blue tits is related to the expression of nestling carotenoid‚Äêbased coloration, which could play a role in offspring‚Äìparent communication. The bird is a close sitter, hissing and biting at an intruding finger. In the South West of England such behaviour has earned the Eurasian blue tit the colloquial nickname \\"Little Billy Biter\\" or \\"Billy Biter\\", originating from the UK. When protecting its eggs it raises its crest, but this is a sign of excitement rather than anger, for it is also elevated during nuptial display. The nesting material is usually moss, wool, hair and feathers, and the eggs are laid in April or May. The number in the clutch is often very large, but seven or eight are normal, and bigger clutches are usually laid by two or even more hens. It is not unusual for a single bird to feed the chicks in the nest at a rate of one feed every 90 seconds during the height of the breeding season. In winter they form flocks with other tit species. In an analysis carried out using ring-recovery data in Britain, the survival rate for juveniles in their first year was 38%, while the adult annual survival rate was 53%. From these figures the typical lifespan is only three years. Within Britain, the maximum recorded age is 10 years and 3 months for a bird that was ringed in Bedfordshire. The maximum recorded age overall is 11 years and 7 months for a bird in the Czech Republic. = Diet = Eating peanuts from a garden bird feeder in England The Eurasian blue tit is a valuable destroyer of pests, though it is fond of young buds of various trees, especially when insect prey is scarce, and may pull them to bits in the hope of finding insects. It is a well-known predator of many Lepidoptera species including the Wood Tiger moth. No species, however, destroys more coccids and aphids, the worst foes of many plants. It takes leaf miner grubs and green tortrix moths (Tortricidae). Seeds are eaten, as with all this family, and blue tits in British urban areas have evolved the ability to digest milk and cream. = Voice = Calls of a blue tit Eurasian blue tits use songs and calls throughout the year. Songs are mostly used in late winter and spring to defend the territory or to attract mates. Calls are used for multiple reasons. Communication with other Eurasian blue tits is the most important motivation for the use of calls. They inform one another on their location in trees by means of contact-calls. They use alarm-calls to warn others (including birds of other species such as the great tit, the European robin or the treecreeper) about the presence of predators in the neighbourhood. Scolding, for example, is used when a ground predator (e.g. fox, cat or dog), a low flying predator or a perched owl are noticed. Sometimes this is followed by mobbing behaviour in which birds gather together in flocks to counter a predator. The alarm- whistle warns other birds about the proximity of a Eurasian sparrowhawk, a northern goshawk, a common buzzard or other flying predators that form a potential danger in the air. A series of high-pitched notes are given by both partners before and during copulation. The begging-call is used by juveniles to beg for food from parents. = Learnt Behaviours = Eurasian blue tits are able to culturally transmit learning to other tit species. An example of this, dating from the 1920s, is the ability to open milk bottles with foil tops, to get at the cream underneath. Such behaviour has been suppressed recently by the gradual change of human dietary habits (low-fat or skimmed milk instead of full-fat), and the way of getting them (from a supermarket in plastic containers with hard plastic lids, instead of the milkman). In addition, the instinct to strip bark from trees in search of insects has developed into a tendency to peel building materials such as thatch, wallpaper, stucco and window putty. = Predators and natural threats = The small size of the Eurasian blue tit makes it vulnerable to prey by larger birds such as jays who catch the vulnerable fledglings when leaving the nest. The most important predator is probably the sparrowhawk, closely followed by the domestic cat. Nests may be robbed by mammals such as weasels and red squirrels, as well as introduced grey squirrels in the UK. The successful breeding of chicks is dependent on sufficient supply of green caterpillars as well as satisfactory weather. Breeding seasons may be affected badly if the weather is cold and wet between May and July, particularly if this coincides with the emergence of the caterpillars on which the nestlings are fed. = Parasites = A bald blue tit with mite Eurasian blue tits are known to be host to feather mites, and rarely lice and flat flies. In Europe, the only feather mite species known to live on the blue tit host is Proctophyllodes stylifer. However, this mite seems to be of no concern to the bird as, until now, it is only known to feed on dead feather tissue. P. stylifer lives all its developmental stages, i.e. egg, larva, protonymph, tritonymph and adult, within the plumage of the same host. The usual sites where P. stylifer is encountered are the remiges and the rectrices of the bird where they can be found tandemly positioned between the barbs of the rachis.  Status and conservation  The Eurasian blue tit is classified as a least concern species on the IUCN Red List (version 3.1), and as a Green Status species, since 1996, by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in the United Kingdom.  Cultural significance  The Eurasian blue tit has appeared on many stamps and ornaments. Its most recent appearance on a British stamp was the 2010 Birds of Britain series.

The name \\"phpBB\\" is an abbreviation of PHP Bulletin Board. Available under the GNU General Public License, phpBB is free and open-source. Features of phpBB include support for multiple database engines (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server), flat message structure (as opposed to threaded), hierarchical subforums, topic split/merge/lock, user groups, multiple attachments per post, full-text search, plugins and various notification options (e-mail, Jabber instant messaging, ATOM feeds). History phpBB was started by James Atkinson as a simple UBB-like forum for his own website on June 17, 2000. Nathan Codding and John Abela joined the development team after phpBB's CVS repository was moved to SourceForge.net, and work on version 1.0.0 began. A fully functional, pre-release version of phpBB was made available in July. =phpBB 1.0.0= A default installation of the original phpBB phpBB 1.0.0 was released on December 16, 2000, with subsequent improvements to the 1.x codebase coming in two more major installments. The final release in the 1.x line was phpBB 1.4.4, released on November 6, 2001. During the lifetime of the 1.x series, Bart van Bragt, Paul S. Owen (former co-manager of the project), Jonathan Haase and Frank Feingold joined the team. phpBB 1.x is no longer supported and virtually no websites continue to use it. =phpBB 2.0.x= A default installation of phpBB 2.0 In February 2001, phpBB 2.0.x began development entirely from scratch; the developer's ambitions for phpBB had outgrown the original codebase. Doug Kelly joined the team shortly afterwards. After a year of development and extensive testing, phpBB 2.0.0, dubbed the \\"Super Furry\\" version, was released on April 4, 2002, three days later than intended. phpBB2 was the predecessor of the present-day phpBB3. Developed during 2001‚Äì2002, the source code was written primarily to run on PHP 3.0 and 4.0 (version 2.0.13 upped the minimum requirement to PHP 4.0.3 due to a necessary security fix), and by the time that phpBB3 was released in late 2007, the developers and other team members felt that it no longer met their quality coding standards, and announced plans for the retirement/end of support of 2.0.x within a few months of 3.0.0's release. phpBB2 was never officially supported under PHP 5. Although many users had no problems running it after making a few changes to PHP 5's default configuration settings, the teams chose not to offer support for this configuration. Official support for phpBB2 ended on January 1, 2009, and the 2.0.x support forums have been locked. Furthermore, all development for phpBB2, including security patches, has ceased as of February 1, 2009. However, a number of unofficial support sites for phpBB2 have formed to fill the void. Many administrators still prefer to run phpBB2 because it provides a much simpler administration interface and has a thriving ecosystem of MODs (modifications) and styles that allow admins many options for customising the software to their liking. Others still run phpBB2 because they have installed many MODs, none of which are compatible with phpBB3. The default theme in phpBB2 is named subSilver (The predecessor to SubSilver2, the default in phpBB3), and was designed by Tom \\"subBlue\\" Beddard. At the time that it premiered in 2001, it was a revolutionary new design for bulletin boards, and many bulletin board themes since have borrowed many cues and design elements from subSilver. Some of phpBB2's major features included the following: * A templated style system intended to simplify customisation and keep the PHP code separate from the HTML. * Support for internationalisation through a language pack system; 48 translations are available for phpBB2 as of 2007. * Compatibility with multiple database management systems including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Microsoft Access, * Code and interface customisations, termed MODs and styles. The last official release of the 2.0.x line is 2.0.23, released on February 17, 2008. However, the code for phpBB 2.0.24 still remains, unreleased, in the Git repository. =phpBB 3.0.x= A default installation of phpBB 3.0 Work on phpBB 3.0.x began in late 2002. It was originally intended to be released as phpBB 2.2, and the first planned feature list was announced on May 25, 2003. However, as development progressed, the developers realised that phpBB 2.1.x (the development release cycle for 2.2) had eliminated virtually all compatibility with the 2.0.x line, so the version number for release was changed to 3.0.0, in keeping with the Linux kernel versioning scheme, which phpBB followed at the time. In September 2005, Paul Owen resigned as the Development Team Leader and Meik Sievertsen was promoted to the role. In March 2007, the phpBB team launched their new website, powered by phpBB3 with the new prosilver style. The prosilver style was originally not intended to be revealed until the final release of phpBB 3.0.0. On April 30, 2007, phpBB founder and co-Project Manager James Atkinson officially resigned from his duties towards phpBB, citing personal circumstances. With the announcement also came the announcement that phpBB was now newly independent, and that the team leaders would be collectively taking charge of the decisions in the future of the project. At the end of May, an announcement was made that Jonathan \\"SHS\`\\" Stanley, the other co-Project Manager, was stepping down as well for personal reasons. The first beta of phpBB3 was released in June 2006, and the first release candidate was released in May 2007. The phpBB3 codebase received an external security audit in September, which was done by SektionEins. Finally, phpBB 3.0.0 \\"Olympus\\" (also dubbed the Gold release) was published on December 13, 2007. On July 7, 2007, the teams announced that phpBB had been nominated as a finalist for the SourceForge.net Community Choice Awards in the category of \\"Best Project for Communications\\". At the end of the month, SourceForge.net announced that phpBB had won the award for \\"Best Project for Communications\\", and in honour of the award, SourceForge.net donated $1000 in phpBB's name to Marie Curie Cancer Care. phpBB also won a \\"Thingamagoop\\" from Bleep Labs, and \\"bragging rights for a full year.\\" In September 2007, the teams launched an official phpBB podcast. It was recorded by a rotating group of phpBB team members with occasional guests, and discussed a number of phpBB-related topics, as well as answering questions e-mailed in from listeners. However, the podcast only lasted for a few episodes and production ceased the following spring. Its successor is generally considered to be the new phpBB weblog, which launched in July 2008. The blog is written by phpBB team members (with occasional guest posts by community members) on various topics related to phpBB and provide users with a unique inside look at the activities of the phpBB teams. The phpBB teams held their first-ever phpBB users conference in London on July 20, 2008, which was titled \\"Londonvasion 2008.\\" Londonvasion featured presentations by phpBB team members on various topics important to the phpBB community, MOD authors, and developers. Londonvasion provided a unique opportunity to socialise with members of the phpBB teams. The event also represented the first time that most members of the teams had a chance to meet each other in person. The phpBB teams underwent numerous changes in 2009. On January 1, the teams formally ended support for phpBB2. Many of the non- development teams released betas and release candidates of side projects during this time. The first beta of AutoMOD, an automatic installer of phpBB MODifications, was released by the Extensions Team (formerly known as the MOD Team) on December 22, 2008. The first release candidate of the Unified MOD Install Library (UMIL), a framework for allowing MOD authors to design simple database installation scripts, was released by the Extensions Team on January 12, 2009. The first release candidate of the Support Toolkit, a package of tools to diagnose and fix common support-related issues with phpBB, was released by the Support Team on June 24. On June 10, 2009 the phpBB Development Team broke with their precedent of keeping future development plans under wraps and publicly previewed a series of new features that would be coming in phpBB 3.0.6. After four RC releases, phpBB 3.0.6 was released on November 17. The most notable new features included a bare-bones quick reply editor (a feature which the teams had historically been firmly opposed to), support for ACM (cache) plugins, ATOM feed support, and a plugin-based CAPTCHA system, including built-in support for reCAPTCHA among others. The modularization of phpBB's CAPTCHA also provided an API for MOD authors to write CAPTCHA plugins, allowing for greater diversification of the CAPTCHAs used in phpBB installations. The Extensions Team also ran a competition to encourage CAPTCHA plugin development. On June 10, 2009, phpBB's Development Team revealed that the next phpBB3 release, 3.0.6, would include a significant number of new features. This is unusual for a minor release which is typically limited to bug and security fixes. New features would include support for new CAPTCHA plugins, ATOM feeds, support for new cache plugins (XCache, Alternative PHP Cache, eAccelerator, Memcache, and a \\"null\\" no-cache plugin), and quick reply (an often-requested feature by a subset of phpBB users) among other minor feature additions. phpBB 3.0.6 has had four RC releases and its final release was on November 17, 2009. The final stable release of phpBB 3.0 was 3.0.14, released May 4, 2015. End of Life for phpBB 3.0.x was November 2015. =phpBB 3.1.x= The responsive design since phpBB 3.1 In 2009 the phpBB Development Team had begun working on phpBB 3.1, formerly versioned as phpBB 3.2. (Before July 29, 2009, phpBB followed the original Linux kernel versioning scheme, in which the middle number represents a development version if it is odd and a stable version if it is even). The developers previewed their planned feature list at Londonvasion, and new features include a complete overhaul of the Moderator Control Panel (MCP) and moderation capabilities, implementation of AJAX where it is applicable and helpful, a trigger-based event system, a completely rewritten BBCode system, RSS feed support, enhancements to custom profile fields, enhancements to private messaging, a new authentication system with OpenID support, and numerous other small changes and features. The phpBB teams maintain a website for phpBB development named Area51. In keeping with the tradition to codename every new phpBB3 release after Martian mountains, phpBB 3.1 was code-named \\"Ascraeus,\\" named after Ascraeus Mons, the second-tallest mountain on Mars. (Olympus Mons, which 3.0 was named after, is the tallest.) On July 29, 2009, the Development Team announced \\"significant changes\\" to the phpBB's development process and release cycle. Chief among these was the decision to abandon the former Linux kernel versioning scheme, meaning that whether part of the version number was even or odd no longer was significant. As such, Ascraeus (the successor to 3.0.0 Olympus) is to become phpBB 3.1.0. (The original versioning scheme dictated that 3.1.x would be a development branch, meaning that Ascraeus would have been released as 3.2.0.) Subsequent feature releases of phpBB3 will be versioned as 3.2.0, 3.3.0, etc. phpBB 4.0.0 will represent a fundamentally redesigned version of phpBB. The strategy also committed the teams to continue supporting an older \\"stable\\" branch for at least 6‚Äì9 months after a newer \\"feature\\" branch was released. However, an exception was made for 3.0.6 which was already in development. Although it contained enough significant new features that it could have been considered a 3.1.0 release, it remained a part of the 3.0.x branch, which also meant that the teams did not have to simultaneously continue supporting 3.0.5 after 3.0.6's release. In January 2010, Meik Sievertsen stepped down as Lead Developer, instead taking on the roles of developer and \\"Server Manager\\". Nils Adermann was then promoted to Lead Developer. Since then phpBB have been working on moving over to the Symfony web framework and released phpBB 3.1.0 on October 28, 2014 In March 2010, phpBB moved source code versioning from Subversion to Git in order to improve developer workflow and better involve the community. On April 26, 2013, phpBB 3.1 entered the stage of feature freeze. \\"Ascraeus\\" was finalized and released on October 28, 2014 after several release candidates. A future release \\"Rhea\\" (3.2.x) will be made January 7, 2017. On October 12, 2016, phpBB released the latest stable \\"Ascraeus\\" version: 3.1.10. Due to the late release of 3.2, it was announced that end of maintenance for 3.1 would be extended to June 2017, and end of life for 3.1 extended to December 2017. In addition to development of phpBB 3.1, other phpBB teams also are in the process of developing numerous other tools for use by the community. Development for these tools was followed on the phpBB Code Forge, which contained the Subversion repositories for these tools and the main phpBB development trunk. =phpBB 3.2.x= The first of two release candidates for 3.2.x \\"Rhea\\" was made available on June 27, 2016, the second on December 9, 2016. It was announced on December 25, 2016 that the official launch for phpBB 3.2.0 would be on January 7, 2017. phpBB 3.2 introduces major changes and new functionality. Among the new features are a completely revised installer including CLI (Command-Line Interface) support, a new BBCode system that adds more power to quotes and supports emojis, and full support for PHP 7.1. =phpBB 3.3.x= The first release candidate for 3.3.x \\"Proteus\\" was made available on December 23, 2019. On January 6, 2020, phpBB officially launched phpBB 3.3.0. It was built upon 3.2 \\"Rhea\\" and it's their big step towards a more modern base while maintaining a clear update path. MODs MODs are code modifications created by the phpBB community, often used to extend the functionality of or change the display of phpBB. The term is capitalised to distinguish code modifications from forum moderators, the latter of which is often abbreviated as \\"mods\\". Modifications referred to in this manner are not authored by the phpBB developers, and do not enjoy the same level of support as unmodified official code. The phpBB Extensions Team (formerly known as the phpBB MOD Team), headed by David Col√≥n (known as DavidIQ in the community), accepts modifications from community sources for validation, and modifications which meet the Extensions Team's standards are made available for download from the phpBB Customisations Database. Other sites also provide phpBB2 and phpBB3 modifications for download. Some of the sites have their own standards which they validate to, and other sites do not do any validation, however the phpBB teams do not offer support for boards using MODs downloaded from sites other than phpBB.com. Documentation for phpBB3 MODding is provided by the Extensions Team. MODs are not accepted for the 3.1.x line of phpBB since Extensions have taken their place from that version forward. =MODX= MODX is an XML-based document format developed by the phpBB Extensions Team that is used to describe the steps required to modify the source code of a web application in order to install a modification. Although it can theoretically be utilised for any web application, it was developed for and is primarily used by MODs for phpBB. The phpBB Extensions Team requires that MODs submitted to its database conform to the MODX specifications and other policies. The primary purpose of using an XML-based format is to better allow automatic installation tools, such as AutoMOD, to read and complete the installation instructions. MODX files can be viewed in a web browser using an included XSL file. The latest revision of the MODX spec is 1.2.6, released on December 15, 2012. =AutoMOD= AutoMOD is a tool developed by the phpBB Extensions Team that parses and automatically installs phpBB3 MODs distributed in the MODX format. Users simply have to upload the contents of a MOD download to their phpBB source directory and run AutoMOD, which will parse the MOD instructions and make the necessary file changes. Depending on the server configurations, it will either automatically merge the changes into place using FTP, or will create a compressed archive of the changed files for the user to copy into place. AutoMOD is also used by the MOD Team members during validation to ensure that the MODX files are valid and the MOD can be successfully installed on a vanilla phpBB installation. The current version of AutoMOD is 1.0.2. AutoMOD can be downloaded from the AutoMOD information page and support can be obtained in the AutoMOD support forum. AutoMOD is the successor to EasyMOD, a tool for phpBB2 which was also developed by the phpBB Extensions Team and performed essentially the same task. The last version of EasyMOD was 0.4.0, released on June 30, 2008. Support for EasyMOD is no longer provided since phpBB2 is retired. =Unified MOD Installation Library (UMIL)= The Unified MOD Installation Library is a library designed to simplify the installation and uninstallation of the database side of MODs.phpbb.com It is designed to be useful for configuring the forum for the new MOD, performing database actions such as adding and removing tables and columns, and purging the forum's cache. UMIL is GPL licensed and the latest version is 1.0.5. It can be downloaded from the UMIL page. To create a UMI-file automatically, a MOD author can use the Unified MOD Installation File creation tool. Security In December 2004, a large number of Web sites were defaced by the Santy worm, which used vulnerabilities in outdated versions of phpBB2 to overwrite PHP and HTML pages. Although these were the result of outdated versions of PHP and phpBB, incidents like these have caused the security of phpBB to be disputed. There have also been a few times where new releases of phpBB have come out a few days apart, most recently with version 3.2.7 in May 2019. However, the phpBB Team usually responds to security reports as soon as possible, and releases a new version quickly. The phpBB Group, attempting to learn from previous failures, performed a codebase security audit before the release of 2.0.18. The phpBB3 codebase received an external security audit in September 2007, which was done by SektionEins. The sixth release candidate of phpBB3 was published following the results of the security audit. Changes were made to phpBB2 to avoid problems in the future, such as a re-authentication system for the administration panel, backported from phpBB3. This was introduced after a cookie verification issue allowed attackers to gain administrator access. In November 2005, the phpBB Group announced a new Incident Investigation Team (IIT), a sub-team of their Support Team, which is responsible for assisting users in the cleanup and repair of an attacked phpBB installation and investigating reports of new exploits.Announcing the Incident Investigation Team from the phpBB.com community forums The team announced a tracker the following January where administrators of attacked bulletin boards could report an attack and receive support from the IIT. The CAPTCHA system in phpBB2 has proven vulnerable to automated registrations, with numerous phpBB- based forums being swamped by forum spam. phpBB3 has improved its anti-spam options available to forum administrators, including a new CAPTCHA system, suspensions, user logging and other various features. The phpBB team has published recommendations on protecting the boards from spam. Currently the best method is to use a Q&A; (question-answer) challenge, which was introduced into phpBB 3.0.6. phpBB3 has a much stronger CAPTCHA system, however during the phpBB3 development/beta phase it was frequently criticised for being difficult to read. The development team has been working on improving its readability prior to phpBB3's final release. Additionally, the teams have announced that each minor release of phpBB3 (3.0.1, 3.0.2, etc.) will be preceded by individual release candidates in an effort to prevent instances where subsequent releases would be only days apart (as happened a couple of times during the 2.0.x line). phpBB 3 notifies the administrator of new releases via the Administration Control Panel.Checking for updates phpBB 3.0 Olympus Documentation, phpBB.com phpBB community phpBB has a community of users who contribute to the overall project with content such as Extensions, MODs and Styles. They also provide supplementary support as assistance to the phpBB Support Team. Community users are encouraged to participate in these support requests and to contribute to the overall betterment of phpBB core code.

Heywood, Richard K. Brummitt, Ole Seberg, and Alastair Culham. Flowering Plant Families of the World. Firefly Books: Ontario, Canada. (2007). . It is not known to which of the other families in the order it is most closely related.Peter F. Stevens (2001 onwards). \\"Bignoniaceae\\" At: Angiosperm Phylogeny Website. At: Botanical Databases At: Missouri Botanical Garden Website. (see External links below) Nearly all of the Bignoniaceae are woody plants, but a few are subwoody, either as vines or subshrubs. A few more are herbaceous plants of high-elevation montane habitats, in three exclusively herbaceous genera: Tourrettia, Argylia, and Incarvillea. The family includes many lianas, climbing by tendrils, by twining, or rarely, by aerial roots. The largest tribe in the family, called Bignonieae, consists mostly of lianas and is noted for its unique wood anatomy.Eberhard Fischer, Inge Theisen, and L√∫cia G. Lohmann. 2004. \\"Bignoniaceae\\". pages 9-38. In: Klaus Kubitzki (editor) and Joachim W. Kadereit (volume editor). The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants volume VII. Springer-Verlag: Berlin; Heidelberg, Germany. The family has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, but is mostly tropical, with a few species native to the temperate zones. Its greatest diversity is in northern South America. The family has been covered in some major floristic projects, such as Flora of China, Flora Malesiana, and Flora Neotropica. It has not yet been covered in some others, such as Flora of Australia, and Flora of North America. Bignoniaceae are most noted for ornamentals, such as Jacaranda, Tabebuia and Spathodea, grown for their conspicuous, tubular flowers.George W. Staples and Derral R. Herbst. 2005. \\"A Tropical Garden Flora\\" Bishop Museum Press: Honolulu, HI, USA. A great many species are known in cultivation.Anthony Huxley, Mark Griffiths, and Margot Levy (1992). The New Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary of Gardening. The Macmillan Press, Limited: London. The Stockton Press: New York. (set). Various other uses have been made of members of this family. Several species were of great importance to the indigenous peoples of the American tropics. Fridericia elegans, Tanaecium bilabiata, and Tanaecium excitosum are poisonous to livestock and have caused severe losses. According to different accounts, the number of species in the family is about 810David J. Mabberley. 2008. Mabberley's Plant-Book third edition (2008). Cambridge University Press: UK. or about 860. The last monograph of the entire family was published in 2004. In that work, 104 genera were recognized. Since that time, molecular phylogenetic studies have greatly clarified relationships within the family, and the number of accepted genera is now between 80 and 85.L√∫cia G. Lohmann and Carmen U. Ulloa. 2007 onward. Bignoniaceae in iPlants prototype Checklist. (See External links below). Bignoniaceae in Bagh-e-Jinnah, Lahore  Genera  In the last taxonomic revision of Bignoniaceae, 104 genera were described in The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants. Twenty-five of these genera, all in the tribe Bignonieae, were later synonymized under other genera, based on a cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, published in 2006. Roseodendron and Handroanthus were resurrected from Tabebuia in 2007. Mayodendron and Pachyptera have been resurrected. In 2009, a phylogenetic study divided Bignoniaceae into 10 monophyletic groups, as shown in the genus list below. Six of these groups have been recognized as tribes at one time or another, and are represented by their tribal names. Two of the groups are monogeneric and are designated by their constituent genera, Argylia and Delostoma. The other two groups are given informal names, pending a formal revision of the infrafamilial classification. Astianthus has never been sampled for DNA and its systematic position within the family remains obscure. Likewise, the placement of Romeroa in the Tabebuia alliance and the placement of Sphingiphila in Bignonieae are in doubt. Tecomaria is not included in the list below, and its recognition is controversial. It is monotypic (Tecomaria capensis), and had been long accepted, but was returned to Tecoma in 1980. A molecular phylogenetic study resolved it as sister to another South African genus, Podranea, but with only weak bootstrap support. Tecomaria has not yet been resurrected or transferred to another genus. The tribe Bignonieae has been the subject of considerable revision since 2006. Fischer et al. placed 46 genera in this tribe. Afterward, Perianthomega was transferred to it from Tecomeae sensu lato and Pachyptera was resurrected from Mansoa. Twenty-five of the genera of Fischer have been subsumed into other genera as follows: Gardnerodoxa into Neojobertia; Memora into Adenocalymma; Leucocalantha into Pachyptera; Pseudocatalpa, Paragonia, Periarrabidaea, Spathicalyx, and Ceratophytum into Tanaecium; Arrabidaea and Piriadacus into Fridericia; Clytostoma, Cydista, Macranthisiphon, Mussatia, Phryganocydia, Potamoganos, Roentgenia and Saritaea into Bignonia; also Distictis, Glaziovia, Haplolophium, and Pithecoctenium into Amphilophium.

Lianas of the tribe Bignonieae have a unique vascular structure, in which phloem arms extend downward into the xylem because certain segments of the cambium cease the production of xylem at an early stage of development. The number of these arms is four or a multiple thereof, up to 32. When four, the phloem arms appear as a cross, hence, the common name \\"cross vine\\". The phloem in the arms has wider sieve tubes and less parenchyma than the ordinary phloem. The leaves are petiolate. Leaf arrangement usually is opposite, or rarely alternate or verticillate (in whorls). Leaves are usually compound, bifoliate, trifoliate, pinnate, or palmate, or rarely simple. Stipules are absent, but persistent; enlarged axillary bud scales (pseudostipules) are often present. Domatia occur in some genera. Dolichandrone falcata in Hyderabad, India Flowers are solitary or in inflorescences in a raceme or a helicoid or dichasial cyme. Inflorescences bear persistent or deciduous bracts or bractlets. The flowers are hypogynous, zygomorphic, bisexual, and usually conspicuous. The calyx and corolla are distinct. The calyx is synsepalous, with five sepals. The corolla is sympetalous, with five petals, often bilabiate. Corolla lobes are imbricate in bud, or rarely valvate, and usually much shorter than the corolla tube. Stamens are inserted on the corolla tube, alternating with corolla lobes. The four stamens are didynamous, members of each pair often connivent, the adaxial stamen is usually staminodial or absent; rarely with five fertile stamens or with two fertile and three staminodial stamens. The stigma is bilobed, and usually sensitive; a style is present. The ovary is superior, usually surrounded by a nectary disk, composed of two carpels, bilocular and with a septum, except unilocular in Tourrettia and quadrilocular in Eccremocarpus. Placentation is axile, except parietal in Tourrettia. Ovules are numerous. Bignoniaceae flower, upper lip removed. Notice the didynamous 4 stamens and the style-stigma, all in dorsal position. The fruit is usually a bivalved capsule, often with a replum. Dehiscence is septicidal or loculicidal. The three exceptions are the genera Kigelia, Crescentia and its close relatives, and Colea and its close relatives. In these, the fruit is indehiscent, not a capsule, and the seeds are not winged. The fruit is a berry in Colea. Seeds are usually flat and winged. Aril is absent. Endosperm usually absent, and sometimes sparse. Lapachol, a yellow, skin-irritating naphthoquinone, is often found in the wood. Other naphthoquinones, as well as anthraquinones, are also present in various parts of the plant. Jacaranone is a quinonoid from Jacaranda. True tannins are not present. Pigments are mostly flavones, anthocyanins, and carotenoids.Robert Hegnauer. 1989. Chemotaxonomie der Pflanzen 8:128-138. Birkh√§user Verlag: Basel, Switzerland; Boston MA, USA; Berlin, Germany. Iridoids are usually present. Other compounds detected in Bignoniaceae include verbascosides, cornoside, quercetin, ursolic acid, and saponins. The chromosome number does not vary much in Bignoniaceae. The haploid (base chromosome number) is 20 for nearly every species sampled, but some species have very small chromosomes, making an accurate count difficult. B chromosomes are common in Bignoniaceae. Pollination is either entomophilous (via insects), ornithophilous (via birds), or cheiropterophilous (via bats).  Uses  Many species of Bignoniaceae have some use, either commercially or ethnobotanically, but the most important, by far, are those planted as ornamentals, especially the flowering trees. Jacaranda, Campsis, Pyrostegia, Tabebuia, Roseodendron, Handroanthus and Crescentia all have species of horticultural significance, at least in warm climates. Several others, including Tecoma, Podranea, Pandorea, Bignonia and Mansoa are frequently grown as ornamentals, at least in certain areas of the tropics. A great many species are known in cultivation, if only rarely. Jacaranda mimosifolia is common as an avenue tree. The winged petiole and trifoliate leaf of Crescentia alata resembles a crucifixion cross, so is sometimes planted in the Philippines as a religious symbol. Handroanthus and the unrelated Guaiacum (Zygophyllaceae) have the hardest, heaviest, and most durable wood of the American tropics. Important timber trees in Handroanthus include H. heptaphyllus, H. serratifolius, H. guayacan, H. chrysanthus, and H. billbergii. Tabebuia rosea (including Tabebuia pentaphylla) is harvested for lumber throughout the New World tropics. Tabebuia heterophylla, and Tabebuia angustata are important sources of lumber for some of the Caribbean islands. Several species of Catalpa are also important timber trees. Paratecoma was once the most important timber tree of the Rio de Janeiro area, but relentless exploitation has brought it to the verge of extinction. Several of the rare species of Bignoniaceae produce excellent wood, but are often not recognized by lumberjacks. Several uses of plants in Bignoniaceae are known locally. Parmentiera aculeata is grown for its edible fruit in Central America and southern Mexico. The powdered seeds and sometimes the fruit pulp of Crescentia cujete and Crescentia alata are used in Nicaragua to make a refresco called semilla de jicaro. Onion-scented species of Mansoa and clove-scented species of Tynanthus are used as condiments. In northern Colombia, shavings of the stems of Dolichandra quadrivalvis are added to bait which is left overnight near the burrows of crabs. The crabs are paralyzed for a few hours after eating the bait and are picked up by crabbers in the morning. The crabs recover before they reach market, and no harm from eating them has been reported. Tanaecium nocturnum is the source of a hallucinogenic drug.Christian R√§tsch. 2005. The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants (translated by John R. Baker). Park Street Press: Rochester VT, USA. . Its crushed leaves and stems are used to enervate bees while gathering honey. Fridericia chica is the source of a red pigment used in the Amazon Basin for body paint and for dye in basketry. Cybistax antisyphilitica is the source of a blue dye commonly used in Peru. The bark of Sparattosperma leucantha is used in Bolivia to produce a brown dye for staining cotton thread. Medical claims are innumerable and usually spurious. Gentry describes an especially ludicrous example. Misidentification of plants, even by botanists, continues to be a big problem for ethnobotany, and it is especially severe for Bignoniaceae. Voucher specimens are often sterile and fragmentary, making them nearly impossible to identify. False medical claims are often based on mistaken identification. The bark of several species of Handroanthus is sold in South American markets. Similar-looking bark is often fraudulently passed off as Handroanthus. It is used in various ways to relieve certain symptoms of certain cancers. No evidence shows it prevents the disease or slows its progression, as is often claimed. Adenocalymma flavida has been used to relieve the aching of joints and muscles. A root extract from Martinella is useful in the treatment of conjunctivitis and possibly other conditions of the eye.  History  The family Bignoniaceae was first validly published in the botanical literature (as Bignonieae) by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789 in his classic work, Genera Plantarum.James L. Reveal. 2008on. \\"Bignoniaceae\\" In: A checklist of suprageneric names for extant vascular plants At: Home page of James L. Reveal & C. Rose Broome. (See External links below). The type genus for this family is Bignonia, which was validated by Linnaeus in Species Plantarum in 1753.Bignonia In: International Plant Names Index. (see External links below). The name originated with Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, who named it for his benefactor, Jean-Paul Bignon, in 1694, in his influential El√©ments de botanique ou m√©thode pour conna√Ætre les plantes.Umberto Quattrocchi. 2000. CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names volume I. CRC Press: Boca Raton; New York; Washington, DC;, USA. London, UK. (vol. I). Important groundwork for future study of the family was laid down from 1789 to 1837, mostly by Jussieu, Kunth, Bojer and G.Don (George Don (1798-1856) not George Don the elder (1764-1814). Bentham and Hooker surveyed the family in their Genera Plantarum in 1876.George Bentham and Joseph D. Hooker. 1876. Genera plantarum :ad exemplaria imprimis in Herberiis Kewensibus servata definita vol. 2 part 2:1026-1053. Reeve & Co. London, England. (See External links below). Karl Moritz Schumann wrote a monograph on Bignoniaceae in 1894 for Engler and Prantl's Die Nat√ºrlichen Pflanzenfamilien. After Schumann's monograph, no taxonomic treatment of the entire family was published until 2004. As the number of known species gradually increased, a great deal of confusion developed over the delimitation of genera. New genera were frequently erected for species that did not clearly belong to any of the previously described genera. This resulted in a proliferation of monotypic genera. Gentry reduced the number of genera in 1973, 1976, and 1979. Nevertheless, the revision of 2004 described 104 genera, 38 of them monotypic. This problem was especially acute in the tribe Bignonieae. In that tribe, many species of uncertain affinity were assigned to a vaguely defined Arrabidaea, turning that genus into a dumping ground of about 100 species. Since 2004, molecular phylogenetic studies have shown a substantial revision of the genera is necessary. Much work toward this goal can be viewed online, but little of it has yet been published in scientific papers. A detailed taxonomic history of Bignoniaceae was published in 1980. A summary of this history was published in 1999.Russell E. Spangler and Richard G. Olmstead. 1999. \\"Phylogenetic Analysis of Bignoniaceae Based on the cpDNA Gene Sequences of rbcL and ndhF\\". Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden 86(1):33-46. (See External links below).  Taxonomy  In the APG III system of classification for flowering plants, Bignoniaceae is one of the 23 families in the order Lamiales. (Lamiales has 25 families if Mazaceae and Rehmanniaceae are accepted). Within the order, Bignoniaceae is in a group of eight families consisting of Thomandersiaceae, Pedaliaceae, Martyniaceae, Schlegeliaceae, Bignoniaceae, Verbenaceae, Acanthaceae, and Lentibulariaceae. This group is described as a polytomy, meaning no two of its members are known to be more closely related to each other than to any of the others. Statistical support for this group remains weak, indicating insufficient data have been applied, or the group is an artifact of some phylogenetic method. The composition of Bignoniaceae has been relatively stable and has not varied at all in the 21st century. In the 20th century, the only issues of circumscription were whether Paulowniaceae and Schlegeliaceae should be merged into Bignoniaceae, or accepted as separate families. The Paulowniaceae consist of one to four genera: Paulownia, Shiuyinghua, Wightia, and Brandisia. Whatever their circumscription, Paulowniaceae are now known to be close to Phrymaceae and Orobanchaceae, rather than to Bignoniaceae. The family Schlegeliaceae has been included in Bignoniaceae, as tribe Schlegelieae, as recently as 1980. It is now accepted as a distinct family, but its relationships with several other families remain unresolved. In molecular phylogenetic analyses, Bignoniaceae has surprisingly weak bootstrap support, given its morphological coherence. The tribe Jacarandeae (Digomphia and Jacaranda) is sister to the rest of the family, which is known as the Core Bignoniaceae. The Core Bignoniaceae is strongly supported in all molecular phylogenetic analyses, but has no known morphological synapomorphy. No subfamilies have been proposed for Bignoniaceae in recent taxonomy, but in 2004, Fischer et al. divided the family into seven tribes: Tourrettieae, Eccremocarpeae, Tecomeae (sensu lato), Bignonieae, Oroxyleae, Crescentieae, and Coleeae. Since that time, Tourrettieae and Eccremocarpeae have been merged under the name Tourrettieae. Tecomeae sensu lato has been shown to be polyphyletic, consisting of the following groups: Astianthus, Jacarandeae, Argylia, Delostoma, Perianthomega, Catalpeae, Tecomeae sensu stricto, and all of Crescentiina except those genera placed in Crescentieae or Coleeae. All of these groups are monophyletic except Crescentiina pro parte. The whole Crescentiina is monophyletic. Crescentiina is one of a type of name with no definite taxonomic rank. Crescentiina is composed of two strongly supported clades, informally named the Tabebuia alliance and the Paleotropical clade. The tribe Crescentieae is embedded in the Tabebuia alliance and might be expanded to include Spirotecoma. Coleeae sensu Fischer et al. (2004) is polyphyletic because of the inclusion of Kigelia, and it is nested within the Paleotropical clade. Perianthomega has been transferred from Tecomeae sensu stricto to Bignonieae, where it is sister to the remainder of the tribe. Thus, Bignoniaceae can be divided into 10 monophyletic groups (see Genera above).  Phylogeny  The phylogenetic tree shown below is based on the results of four phylogenetic studies. For all clades, posterior probability is at least 0.95 and bootstrap support is at least 70%, except where indicated otherwise.  References   Sources  * Alwyn H.

Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (until 2014 known as Lactobacillus bulgaricus) is one of over 200 published species in the Lactobacillus genome complex (LGC) and is the main bacterium used for the production of yogurt. It also plays a crucial role in the ripening of some cheeses, as well as in other processes involving naturally fermented products. It is defined as homofermentive lactic acid bacteria due to lactic acid being the single end product of its carbohydrate digestion. It is also considered a probiotic. It is a gram-positive rod that may appear long and filamentous. It is non-motile and does not form spores. It is also non-pathogenic. It is regarded as aciduric or acidophilic, since it requires a low pH (around 5.4‚Äì4.6) to grow effectively. In addition, it is anaerobic. As it grows on raw dairy products, it creates and maintains the acidic environment that it needs to thrive via its production of lactic acid. In addition, it grows optimally at temperatures of 40-44 ¬∞C under anaerobic conditions. It has complex nutritional requirements which vary according to the environment. These include carbohydrates, unsaturated fatty acids, amino acids, and vitamins. First identified in 1905 by the Bulgarian doctor Stamen Grigorov by isolating it from a yogurt sample, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus can be found naturally in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals living in Bulgaria. One strain, Lactobacillus bulgaricus GLB44, is extracted from the leaves of the Galanthus nivalis (snowdrop flower) in Bulgaria as well. The bacterium is also grown artificially in many countries. It is the national microorganism of India.  Use in industry  Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus is commonly used alongside Streptococcus thermophilus as a starter for making yogurt. The Lb. bulgaricus 2038 strain has been used for decades for yogurt fermentation. The two species work in synergy, with L. d. bulgaricus producing amino acids from milk proteins, which are then used by S. thermophilus. This relationship is considered to be symbiotic. Both species produce lactic acid, which gives yogurt its tart flavor and acts as a preservative. The resulting decrease in pH also partially coagulates the milk proteins, such as casein, resulting in yogurt's thickness. While fermenting milk, L. d. bulgaricus produces acetaldehyde, one of the main yogurt aroma components. Some strains of L. d. bulgaricus, such as L. bulgaricus GLB44, also produce bacteriocins, which have been shown to kill undesired bacteria in vitro. The viability of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus is extremely important in that it is necessary for it to be efficient at fermentation and to effectively keep the food products it produces from spoiling. Freeze-drying is the preferred method of preserving the viability of the cells, but not all cells survive this process. Due to its usefulness in natural fermentation processes, specifically in how it makes fermented food products out of cow's milk, it has great economic importance. Some of the biggest importers of the bacterium are Japan, the United States, and the European Union. It has also been considered a contaminant of beer due to its homofermentative production of lactic acid, an off-flavor in many styles of beer. In other styles of beer, however, lactic acid bacteria can contribute to the overall appearance, aroma, taste, and/or mouthfeel, and generally produce an otherwise pleasing sourness.  History  Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was first identified in 1905 by Stamen Grigorov, who named it Bacillus bulgaricus. Ilya Metchnikoff, a professor at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, researched the relationship between the longevity of Bulgarians and their consumption of yogurt. He had the idea that aging is caused by putrefactive activity, or proteolysis, by microbes that produce toxic substances in the intestine. Proteolytic bacteria such as clostridia, which are part of the normal intestinal flora, produce toxic substances including phenols, ammonia and indols by digestion of proteins. These compounds are responsible for what Metchnikoff called intestinal auto-intoxication, which, according to him, was the cause of the physical changes associated with old age, a concept that has no scientific basis. It was already known at that time that fermentation with lactic acid bacteria inhibits the deterioration of milk because of its low pH. Metchnikoff's research also noted that rural populations in Southeastern Europe and the Russian steppes daily consume milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and live relatively longer than other populations. Based on these data Metchnikoff proposed that consumption of fermented milk seeds the intestine with harmless lactic acid bacteria increasing intestinal acidity and suppressing the growth of proteolytic bacteria. Lactobacillus bulgaricus is a constituent in VSL#3. This proprietary, standardized, formulation of live bacteria may be used in combination with conventional therapies to treat ulcerative colitis and requires a prescription. In 2012 it was declared India's national microbe.  Research  = Quantification in cow's milk cheese via real-time polymerase chain reaction assay = In 2017, there was a study involving the development of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay for quantifying Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus as well as Streptococcus thermophilus in cow's milk cheese. The goal of this study was to create a way to identify and quantify Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, two lactic acid producing species crucial to the fermentation and ripening of cheese, in a timely manner through the use of qPCR. Two assays using lacZ gene targeting PCR primers resulted from this study and were deemed compatible with the two lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species. This allowed for the direct quantification of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus in cheese produced from unpasteurized cow's milk. = Effects of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus on antigenicity of milk proteins = A study in 2012 posed the question of whether or not Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus had any effect on the antigenicity of four kinds of milk proteins, being Œ±-lactalbumin (Œ±-LA), Œ≤-lactoglobulin (Œ≤-LG), Œ±-casein (Œ±-CN), and Œ≤-casein (Œ≤-CN). These proteins are the main proteins found in cow's milk and are known to have antigenic properties in humans, especially young children and infants. 2-5% of young children and infants experience cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA), which has harmful effects on their development and may even result in death. This allergy is facilitated through the antigenicity of the milk proteins, which is the ability of the proteins to trigger an immune response in the body that can result in a number of possible allergic reactions. The study was performed by simulating digestion of unfermented milk and milk that was fermented through exposure to Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to compare their antigenicities in order to see if fermentation had any effect on the antigenicity of the proteins. The antigenicities were measured through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results claimed that the fermentation of cow's milk by Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus reduced the antigenicity of Œ±-LA and Œ≤-CN. However, it also increased the antigenicity of Œ±-CN while Œ≤-LG was not impacted. = Subcellular membrane fluidity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus under cold and osmotic stress = The efficiency of lactic acid bacteria cryopreservation is not consistent and may lead to cell death. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus has adapted to defend against cold stress. The way most cells react to the cold is by changing the fluidity of the cellular membrane, but this particular bacterium has acquired different tactics to fight against cold stress. The first way to cope with the cold is to increase viscosity by taking in compounds such as disaccharides, polysaccharides, amino acids and antioxidants. The second strategy used is performed by inducing active responses during the fermentation or post- fermentation processes. By modifying these it will change the temperature, pH and medium composition. This results in specific metabolic pathways becoming active, with the synthesis of cold shock proteins. = Effects of sorbitol, NaCl, and sodium glutamate on the survivability of Lactobacillus delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus during freeze-drying processes = In 2017, a study was done to see the effects of six different substances on the growth and freeze- drying of Lactobacillus. Using Lactobacillus as starter cultures for the dairy industry depends on the number of viable and active cells. Currently, the preferred method to preserve the bacterial cells is through freeze-drying, however this also results in some strains being killed. This is due to various complications of freeze-drying, including the formation of ice crystals, loss of membrane fluidity, and the denaturation of important macromolecules. Regardless, freeze-drying has been used for decades in microbiological research as a way to store and stabilize cultures. Six substances, being NaCl, sorbitol, mannitol, mannose, sodium glutamate, and betaine were tested to determine if they had any effect on the survivability of the cells after freeze-drying. Three of the six substances added had a positive effect on the growth and freeze-drying of Lactobacillus, being NaCl, sorbitol, and sodium glutamate. The results suggest that these substances have protective effects on Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in small concentrations, but have little effect or even some harmful effects in higher concentrations. The optimal concentrations for sorbitol, NaCl and sodium glutamate for the desired protective effects were .15%, .6%, and .09% respectively. This was shown to increase cell viability drastically.

The name was given to D√©sir√©e Clary not at birth but when she was elected Crown Princess of Sweden in 1810 A given name (also known as a first name or forename) is the part of a personal name quoted in that identifies a person, potentially with a middle name as well, and differentiates that person from the other members of a group (typically a family or clan) who have a common surname. The term given name refers to a name bestowed at or close to the time of birth, usually by the parents of the newborn. A Christian name is the first name which is given at baptism, in Christian custom. In informal situations, given names are often used in a familiar and friendly manner. In more formal situations, a person's surname is more commonly used‚Äîunless a distinction needs to be made between people with the same surname. The idioms 'on a first- name basis' and 'being on first-name terms' refer to the familiarity inherent in addressing someone by their given name. By contrast, a surname (also known as a family name, last name, or gentile name), is normally inherited and shared with other members of one's immediate family.\\"A name given to a person at birth or at baptism, as distinguished from a surname\\" ‚Äì according to the American Heritage Dictionary Regnal names and religious or monastic names are special given names bestowed upon someone receiving a crown or entering a religious order; such a person then typically becomes known chiefly by that name. Name order The order given name ‚Äì family name, commonly known as the Western order, is used throughout most European countries and in countries that have cultures predominantly influenced by European culture, including North and South America; North, East, Central and West India; Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines. The order family name ‚Äì given name, commonly known as the Eastern order, is primarily used in East Asia (for example in China, Japan, Korea, Malaysian Chinese, Singapore, and Vietnam, among others), as well as in Southern and North-Eastern parts of India, and in Hungary. This order is common also in Austria and adjacent areas of Germany (that is, Bavaria), and in France, Belgium, Greece and Italy, possibly because of the influence of bureaucracy, which commonly puts the family name before the given name. In China and Korea, part of the given name may be shared among all members of a given generation within a family and extended family or families, in order to differentiate those generations from other generations. The order given name ‚Äì father's family name ‚Äì mother's family name is commonly used in Spanish-speaking countries to acknowledge the families of both parents. Today the order can also be changed legally in Spain and Uruguay using given name ‚Äì mother's family name ‚Äì father's family name. The order given name ‚Äì mother's family name ‚Äì father's family name is commonly used in Portuguese-speaking countries to acknowledge the families of both parents. Compound In many Western cultures, people often have multiple given names. Most often the first one in sequence is the one that a person goes by, although exceptions are not uncommon, such as in the cases of John Edgar Hoover (J. Edgar) and Dame Mary Barbara Hamilton Cartland (Barbara). The given name might also be used in compound form, as in, for example, John Paul or a hyphenated style like Bengt- Arne. A middle name might be part of compound given name or might be, instead, a maiden name, a patronymic, or a baptismal name. The signature of Alexander Graham Bell. In England, it was unusual for a person to have more than one given name until the seventeenth century when Charles James Stuart ‚Äî King Charles I ‚Äî was baptised with two names. This was a French fashion which spread to the English aristocracy, following the royal example. The fashion then spread to the general population, becoming common by the end of the eighteenth century. Some double given names for women were used at the start of the eighteenth century but these were used together as a unit: Anna Maria, Mary Anne and Sarah Jane. These became stereotyped as the typical names of servants and so became unfashionable in the nineteenth century. In the Southern United States, there is still a common style of female double name. These typically have a hypocoristic form such as Peggy Sue and may include a male element such as Billie Jean. Double names are also common among Vietnamese names, especially in combination with . For example, has the given name .  Legal status  A child's given name or names are usually chosen by the parents soon after birth. If a name is not assigned at birth, one may be given at a naming ceremony, with family and friends in attendance. In most jurisdictions, a child's name at birth is a matter of public record, inscribed on a birth certificate, or its equivalent. In western cultures, people normally retain the same given name throughout their lives. However, in some cases these names may be changed by following legal processes or by repute. People may also change their names when immigrating from one country to another with different naming conventions. In certain jurisdictions, a government-appointed registrar of births may refuse to register a name that may cause a child harm, which is considered offensive or which is deemed impractical. In France, the agency can refer the case to a local judge. Some jurisdictions, such as Sweden, restrict the spelling of names. In Denmark you don't need to register a given name for the child until the child is six months old, and in some cases you can even wait a little longer than this, before the child gets an official name. Origins and meanings Parents may choose a name because of its meaning. This may be a personal or familial meaning, such as giving a child the name of an admired person, or it may be an example of nominative determinism, in which the parents give the child a name that they believe will be lucky or favourable for the child. Given names most often derive from the following categories: * Aspirational personal traits (external and internal). For example, the name Clement means \\"merciful\\". English examples include Faith, Prudence, and August. * Occupations, for example George means \\"earth-worker\\", i.e., \\"farmer\\". * Circumstances of birth, for example Thomas meaning \\"twin\\" or the Latin name Quintus, which was traditionally given to the fifth male child. * Objects, for example Peter means \\"rock\\" and Edgar means \\"rich spear\\". * Physical characteristics, for example Calvin means \\"bald\\". * Variations on another name, especially to change the sex of the name (Pauline, Georgia) or to translate from another language (for instance, the names Francis or Francisco that come from the name Franciscus meaning \\"Frank or Frenchman\\"). * Surnames, for example Winston, Harrison, and Ross. Such names can honour other branches of a family, where the surname would not otherwise be passed down (e.g., the mother's maiden surname). * Places, for example Brittany and Lorraine. * Time of birth, for example day of the week, as in Kofi Annan, whose given name means \\"born on Friday\\", or the holiday on which one was born, for example, the name Natalie meaning \\"born on Christmas day\\" in Latin. Also Tuesday, April, May, or June. * Combination of the above, for example the Armenian name Sirvart means \\"love rose\\". In many cultures, given names are reused, especially to commemorate ancestors or those who are particularly admired, resulting in a limited repertoire of names that sometimes vary by orthography. The most familiar example of this, to Western readers, is the use of Biblical and saints' names in most of the Christian countries (with Ethiopia, in which names were often ideals or abstractions‚ÄîHaile Selassie, \\"power of the Trinity\\"; Haile Miriam, \\"power of Mary\\"‚Äîas the most conspicuous exception). However, the name Jesus is considered taboo or sacrilegious in some parts of the Christian world, though this taboo does not extend to the cognate Joshua or related forms which are common in many languages even among Christians. In some Spanish speaking countries, the name Jesus is considered a normal given name. Similarly, the name Mary, now popular among Christians, particularly Roman Catholics, was considered too holy for secular use until about the 12th century. In countries that particularly venerated Mary, this remained the case much longer; in Poland, until the arrival in the 17th century of French queens named Marie. Most common given names in English (and many other European languages) can be grouped into broad categories based on their origin: * Hebrew names, most often from the Bible, are very common in, or are elements of names used in historically Christian countries. Some have elements meaning \\"God\\", especially \\"Eli\\". Examples: Michael, Joshua, Daniel, Joseph, David, Adam, Samuel, Elizabeth, Hannah and Mary. There are also a handful of names in use derived from the Aramaic, particularly the names of prominent figures in the New Testament‚Äîsuch as Thomas, Martha and Bartholomew. ** All of the Semitic peoples of history and the present day use at least some names constructed like these in Hebrew (and the ancient Hebrews used names not constructed like these‚Äîsuch as Moses, probably an Egyptian name related to the names of Pharaohs like Thutmose and Ahmose). The Muslim world is the best-known example (with names like Saif-al-din, \\"sword of the faith\\", or Abd-Allah, \\"servant of God\\"), but even the Carthaginians had similar names: cf. Hannibal, \\"the grace of god\\" (in this case not the Abrahamic deity God, but the deity‚Äîprobably Melkart‚Äîwhose title is normally left untranslated, as Baal). * Germanic names are characteristically warlike; roots with meanings like \\"glory\\", \\"strength\\", and \\"will\\" are common. The \\"-bert\\" element common in many such names comes from beraht, which means \\"bright\\". Examples: Robert, Edward, Roger, Richard, Albert, Carl, Alfred, Rosalind, Emma, Emmett, Eric and Matilda. * French forms of Germanic names. Since the Norman conquest of England, many English given names of Germanic origin are used in their French forms. Examples: Charles, Henry. *Slavic names may be of a peaceful character, the compounds being derived from word roots meaning \\"to protect\\", \\"to love\\", \\"peace\\", \\"to praise [gods]\\", or \\"to give\\". Examples: Milena, Vesna, Bohumil, Dobromir, Svetlana, Vlastimil. Other names have a warlike character and are built of words meaning \\"fighter\\", \\"war\\", or \\"anger\\". Examples: Casimir, Vladimir, Sambor, Wojciech and Zbigniew. Many of them derive from the root word \\"slava\\" (\\"glory\\"): Boleslav, Miroslav, Vladislav, Radoslav and Stanislav. * Celtic names are sometimes anglicised versions of Celtic forms, but the original form may also be used. Examples: Alan, Brian, Brigid, M√≥rag, Ross, Logan, Ciar√°n, Jennifer, and Se√°n. These names often have origins in Celtic words, as Celtic versions of the names of internationally known Christian saints, as names of Celtic mythological figures, or simply as long-standing names whose ultimate etymology is unclear. * Greek names may be derived from the history and mythology of Classical Antiquity or be derived from the New Testament and early Christian traditions. Such names are often, but not always, anglicised. Examples: Helen, Stephen, Alexander, Andrew, Peter, Gregory, George, Christopher, Margaret, Nicholas, Jason, Timothy, Chloe, Zo√´, Katherine, Penelope and Theodore. *Latin names can also be adopted unchanged, or modified; in particular, the inflected element can be dropped, as often happens in borrowings from Latin to English. Examples: Laura, Victoria, Marcus, Justin (Latin Justinus), Paul (Lat. Paulus), Julius, Cecilia, Felix, Vivian, Julia, Pascal (not a traditional-type Latin name, but the adjective- turned-name paschalis, meaning 'of Easter' (Pascha)). * Word names come from English vocabulary words. Feminine names of this sort‚Äîin more languages than English, and more cultures than Europe alone‚Äîfrequently derive from nature, flowers, birds, colours, or gemstones. Examples include Jasmine, Lavender, Dawn, Daisy, Rose, Iris, Petunia, Rowan, Jade, and Violet. Male names of this sort are less common‚Äîexamples like Hunter and Fischer, or names associated with strong animals, such as Bronco and Wolf. (This is more common in some other languages, such as Northern Germanic and Turkish). * Trait names most conspicuously include the Christian virtues, mentioned above, and normally used as feminine names (such as the three Christian virtues‚ÄîFaith, Hope, and Charity). * Diminutives are sometimes used to distinguish between two or more people with the same given name. In English, Robert may be changed to \\"Robbie\\" or Thomas changed to \\"Tommy\\". In German the names H√§nsel and Gretel (as in the famous fairy tale) are the diminutive forms of Johann and Margarete. Examples: Vicky, Cindy, Tommy, Abby, Allie. * Shortened names (see nickname) are generally nicknames of a longer name, but they are instead given as a person's entire given name. For example, a man may simply be named \\"Jim\\", and it is not short for James. Examples: Beth, Ben, Zach, Tom. * Feminine variations exist for many masculine names, often in multiple forms. Examples: Charlotte, Stephanie, Victoria, Philippa, Jane, Jacqueline, Josephine, Danielle, Paula, Pauline, Patricia, Francesca. Frequently, a given name has versions in many different languages. For example, the biblical name Susanna also occurs in its original biblical Hebrew version, Shoshannah, its Spanish and Portuguese version Susana, its French version, Suzanne, its Polish version, Zuzanna, or its Hungarian version, Zsuzsanna . =East Asia= Despite the uniformity of Chinese surnames, Chinese given names can be fairly original because Chinese characters can be combined extensively. Unlike European languages with their Biblical and Greco-Roman heritage, the Chinese language does not have a particular set of words reserved for given names: any combination of Chinese characters can theoretically be used as a given name. Nonetheless, a number of popular characters commonly recur, including \\"Strong\\" (, Wƒõi), \\"Learned\\" (, W√©n), \\"Peaceful\\" (, ƒÄn), and \\"Beautiful\\" (, Mƒõi). Despite China's increasing urbanization, a great many namessuch as \\"Pine\\" (, S≈çng) and \\"Plum\\" (, M√©i)also still reference nature. Most Chinese given names are two characters long anddespite the examples abovethe two characters together may mean nothing at all. Instead, they may be selected to include particular sounds, tones, or radicals; to balance the Chinese elements of a child's birth chart; or to honor a generation poem handed down through the family for centuries. Traditionally, it is considered an affront and not an honor to have a newborn named after an older relative, so that full names are rarely passed down through a family in the manner of American English Seniors, Juniors, III, etc. Similarly, it is considered disadvantageous for the child to bear a name already made famous by someone else, although Romanizations might be identical or a common name like Liu Xiang might be borne by tens of thousands. Korean names and Vietnamese names are often simply conventions derived from Classical Chinese counterparts. Many female Japanese names end in -ko (), meaning \\"child\\". In many Westernised Asian locations, many Asians also have an unofficial or even registered Western (typically English) given name, in addition to their Asian given name. This is also true for Asian students at colleges in countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia as well as among international businesspeople. Gender Most names in English are traditionally masculine (Hugo, James, Harold) or feminine (Daphne, Charlotte, Jane), but there are unisex names as well, such as Jordan, Jamie, Jesse, Morgan, Leslie/Lesley, Joe/Jo, Jackie, Pat, Dana, etc.). Often, use for one gender is predominant. Also, a particular spelling is often more common for either men or women, even if the pronunciation is the same. Predicting gender using names in the US or Europe is about 99% accurate. Many culture groups, past and present, did not or do not gender names strongly, so that many or all of their names are unisex. On the other hand, in many languages including most Indo-European languages (but not English), gender is inherent in the grammar. Some countries have laws preventing unisex names, requiring parents to give their children sex-specific names. Names may have different gender connotations from country to country or language to language. Within anthroponymic classification, names of human males are called andronyms (from Ancient Greek ·ºÄŒΩŒÆœÅ / man, and ·ΩÑŒΩŒøŒºŒ± / name), while names of human females are called gynonyms (from Ancient Greek Œ≥œÖŒΩŒÆ / woman, and ·ΩÑŒΩŒøŒºŒ± / name). Popularity Most popular US baby names from 1880 to 2012 The popularity (frequency) distribution of given names typically follows a power law distribution. Since about 1800 in England and Wales and in the U.S., the popularity distribution of given names has been shifting so that the most popular names are losing popularity. For example, in England and Wales, the most popular female and male names given to babies born in 1800 were Mary and John, with 24% of female babies and 22% of male babies receiving those names, respectively. In contrast, the corresponding statistics for England and Wales in 1994 were Emily and James, with 3% and 4% of names, respectively. Not only have Mary and John gone out of favour in the English speaking world, the overall distribution of names has also changed significantly over the last 100 years for females, but not for males. This has led to an increasing amount of diversity for female names. =Choice of names= Education, ethnicity, religion, class and political ideology affect parents' choice of names. In the United States, popular names tend to be chosen by parents with more education. Politically conservative parents choose common and traditional names, while politically liberal parents choose the names of literary characters or other relatively obscure cultural figures.J. Eric Oliver, Thomas Wood, Alexandra Bass. \\"Liberellas versus Konservatives: Social Status, Ideology, and Birth Names in the United States\\" Presented at the 2013 Midwestern Political Science Association Annual Meeting Devout members of religions often choose names from their religious scriptures. For example, Hindu parents may name a daughter Saanvi after the goddess, Jewish parents may name a boy Isaac after one of the earliest ancestral figures, and Muslim parents may name a boy Mohammed after the prophet Mohammed. There are many tools parents can use to choose names, including books, websites and applications. An example is the Baby Name Game that uses the Elo rating system to rank parents preferred names and help them select one.Baby Name Game. =Influence of popular culture= Popular culture appears to have an influence on naming trends, at least in the United States and United Kingdom. Newly famous celebrities and public figures may influence the popularity of names. For example, in 2004, the names \\"Keira\\" and \\"Kiera\\" (anglicisation of Irish name Ciara) respectively became the 51st and 92nd most popular girls' names in the UK, following the rise in popularity of British actress Keira Knightley. In 2001, the use of Colby as a boys' name for babies in the United States jumped from 233rd place to 99th, just after Colby Donaldson was the runner-up on Survivor: The Australian Outback. Also, the female name \\"Miley\\" which before was not in the top 1000 was 278th most popular in 2007, following the rise to fame of singer-actress Miley Cyrus (who was named Destiny at birth).Popular Baby Names, Social Security Administration, USA Characters from fiction also seem to influence naming. After the name Kayla was used for a character on the American soap opera Days of Our Lives, the name's popularity increased greatly. The name Tammy, and the related Tamara became popular after the movie Tammy and the Bachelor came out in 1957. Some names were established or spread by being used in literature. Notable examples include Pamela, invented by Sir Philip Sidney for a pivotal character in his epic prose work, The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia; Jessica, created by William Shakespeare in his play The Merchant of Venice; Vanessa, created by Jonathan Swift; Fiona, a character from James Macpherson's spurious cycle of Ossian poems; Wendy, an obscure name popularised by J. M. Barrie in his play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up; and Madison, a character from the movie Splash. Lara and Larissa were rare in America before the appearance of Doctor Zhivago, and have become fairly common since. Songs can influence the naming of children. Jude jumped from 814th most popular male name in 1968 to 668th in 1969, following the release of the Beatles' \\"Hey Jude\\". Similarly, Layla charted as 969th most popular in 1972 after the Eric Clapton song. It had not been in the top 1,000 before. Kayleigh became a particularly popular name in the United Kingdom following the release of a song by the British rock group Marillion. Government statistics in 2005 revealed that 96% of Kayleighs were born after 1985, the year in which Marillion released \\"Kayleigh\\". Popular culture figures need not be admirable in order to influence naming trends. For example, Peyton came into the top 1000 as a female given name for babies in the United States for the first time in 1992 (at #583), immediately after it was featured as the name of an evil nanny in the film The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. On the other hand, historical events can influence child-naming. For example, the given name Adolf has fallen out of use since the end of World War II in 1945. In contrast with these anecdotal evidence, a comprehensive study of Norwegian first name datasets shows that the main factors that govern first name dynamics are endogenous. Monitoring the popularity of 1000 names along 130 years, the authors have identified only five cases of exogenous effects, three of them are connected to the names given to the babies of the Norwegian royal family. =20th century African American names= Since the civil rights movement of 1950-1970, African-American names given to children have strongly mirrored sociopolitical movements and philosophies in the African American community. Since the 1970's neologistic (creative, inventive) practices have become increasingly common and the subject of academic study.

It was founded by the Parliament of Schleswig-Holstein on 1 October 1985 by the National Park Act of 22 July 1985 and expanded significantly in 1999. Together with the Lower Saxon Wadden Sea National Park, the Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park and those parts of Elbe estuary which are not nature reserves, it forms the German part of the Wadden Sea. The national park extends from the German-Danish maritime border in the north down to the Elbe estuary in the south. In the North Frisian area, it includes the mudflats around the geest-based and marsh islands and the Halligen (undyked islands). There, the mudflats are 40 km wide in places. Further south lie areas of mudflats which contain particularly large sandbanks. In addition to the plants and animals that are typical of the entire Wadden Sea, especially large numbers of porpoise, shelduck and eelgrass may be seen in the Schleswig-Holstein part. With an area of 4410 km ¬≤ it is by far the largest national park in Germany. Some 68% of its area is permanently under water and 30% is periodically dry. The land element consists mainly of salt marshes. Since 1990, the national park, including the North Frisian Halligen, has been designated as a UNESCO recognised biosphere. Together with other German and Dutch Wadden Sea areas it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 26 June 2009.  Geography  = National park area = Map of the national park with designated protected zones The national park covers an area from the North Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein by the Danish border in the north to the Elbe estuary in the south. In the northern area (roughly as far as Amrum), the national park boundary extends to the twelve mile territorial limit; to the south it reaches to about the three mile line. On the land side it runs in the sea 150 metres off the coast.Legler, pp. 189‚Äì208 Sea dykes and the foreland immediately in front of the dykes are not part of the national park; beaches are thus largely excluded from the protected zone.Rudolf Eugen Kelch: Viel L√§rm um nichts oder wie Schleswig-Holstein sein Nationalparkgesetz novelliert als pdf Also excluded from the national park are the inhabited areas in the sea, including the five German North Frisian Islands and the larger Halligen islands of Langeness, Hooge, Gr√∂de, Oland and Nordstrandischmoor. Part of the park comprises uninhabited islands, islets and Halligen, such as Trischen, Blauort or the North Frisian Barrier Island. Under the classification of the natural regions of Germany the national park area belongs to the \\"Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea, Islands and Halligen\\" regionhttp://www.bfn.de/0311_landschaft.html?landschaftid=68000 within the Schleswig-Holstein Marshes, and to the major unit of the German Bight. The national park can be divided into two areas. In the north, between the Danish border and the peninsula of Eiderstedt is the North Frisian part; on the south coast of Eiderstedt up to the Elbe estuary is the Dithmarschen part. The North Frisian Wadden Sea, together with the Danish Wadden Sea, belongs to the North Sea. It is screened from the open sea by the North Frisian Islands and the Halligen. The islands were mainly formed from elements of the mainland, which became separated, mainly as a result of flood disasters. The mudflats are protected and the transition between the flats and the sea is often clearer, because the former lie to the east of the large islands and the latter to the west of them. There are no major river estuaries and the tidal range is relatively low at less than two metres. In the northern Wadden Sea there are still geest cliffs formed in the ice ages, so that the highest elevations occur here on the coast in an otherwise very flat area. The Dithmarschen part and the south coast between the Elbe and Eider estuaries form the central part of the Wadden Sea. A tidal range of over three metres has largely prevented the formation of islands. Some sandbars emerge from the sea, but only Trischen is high enough and safe enough from storm surges, to allow saltwater-loving vegetation to grow. Compared to the geologically similar East Frisian Islands of the southern Wadden Sea, Trischen is considerably smaller and younger. All attempts by human inhabitants to fortify the island have failed. With several large estuaries the salinity in the central Wadden Sea is lower than in the rest of the Wadden Sea and is subject to higher fluctuations.CWSS pp. 19‚Äì30 = Protection areas of the National Park = The national park divides into two zones that correspond to different levels of protection. Zone 1 has a size of 162.000 ha and covers a third of the whole national park. The zone consists of 12 bigger units which all contain marshland, intertidal estuarine mudflat, mixed sediment mudflat, sand flat, tidal creeks as well as deep and flat areas that are permanently under water (sublittoral). Additionally there are smaller units around sensible places like breeding areas of coastal birds, sandbars of seals, places where migratory birds moult or geomorphological meaningful areas with natural surface structure.MLUL pp. 32‚Äì34 Zone 1 is principally closed for the public. Exceptions are made for the mudflat areas directly bordering the coastline, some routes for guided mudflat hiking tours and fishery.CWSS pp.125‚Äì131 South of the Hindenburgdamm, facing the landside of Sylt, a human use of the first zone is completely prohibited (Zero use zone). This part is 12.500 ha big, whereof 3500 ha are permanently covered with water. Zone 2 forms a ‚Äòbuffer‚Äô around the first zone, in which a sustainable use is possible. In protection zone 2 west of Sylt¬¥s coast locates a protection area for small whales, eg. the common porpoise, with a size of 124.000 ha. It is an important reproduction area of the porpoise, whose population declined about 90% in the North Sea during the 20th century. Activities like swimming, sailing or traditional crab fishing are still allowed in the area, while international industry fishing, jet-skis, ship velocities over 12 knots, military activities and resource exploitation (sand, grit, gas, oil) should be prevented.Schutzstation Wattenmeer: Walschutzgebiet = Water, land and mudflat = Sunset in the Wadden Sea The North Sea coast is very flat; the ocean floor partially only drops down some centimeters per kilometer. Two times a day the high tide carries sand, clay and silt into the Wadden Sea. The tidal range in Schleswig-Holstein¬¥s part of the Wadden Sea accounts in between 1,5 to 3,7 m, increasing from north to south. The lowest tidal ranges occur on Sylt's north coast, the highest in southern Dithmarschen.Petra Witez: ‚ÄûAbschlussbericht zum Forschungsvorhaben MTK 0608 (03 KIS 3160): Programme zur langfristigen Erhaltung des Wattenmeers ‚Äì Prowatt\\", Hrsg. vom Bundesministerium f√ºr Bildung und Forschung Laboe 2002 pp. 7‚Äì8 Everywhere in the Wadden Sea the amount of time the water needs to stream in is only 85% of the time it needs to run off again. Therefore the current of the water coming in, is much stronger and the low tide does not have the power to remove the sediments the high tide accumulated.Petra Witez: ‚ÄûAbschlussbericht zum Forschungsvorhaben MTK 0608 (03 KIS 3160): Programme zur langfristigen Erhaltung des Wattenmeers ‚Äì Prowatt\\", Hrsg. vom Bundesministerium f√ºr Bildung und Forschung. Laboe 2002, pp. 18‚Äì19 Over 2/3 of the national park are covered with water permanently (sublittoral), 30% of mudflat that is lying dry during low tide and gets flooded with water during high tide (eulittoral).Stock 2006 pp. 8‚Äì23 The rest is land area that only gets flooded under certain conditions (supralittoral). The water areas contain the offshore part of the park as well as huge tidal currents like the Lister Tief, the Heverstrom, the Purrenstrom, the Wesselburener Loch or the Piep. Outside the mudflat area runs a constantly strong current from south to north, coming from the southern North Sea and going on to the Norwegian Trench. Owing to the river mouths of several big European waters (like the Rhine or Elbe), the current¬¥s salinity of 20- 30 psu lies under the one of the ocean, but over the ones of the river mouths. Since inhabited regions are not part of the national park, the land areas are nearly completely covered with salt marshes and a small part contains sandbars and dunes. The salt marshes cover over 10.000 ha, of which 70% developed on land protected by breakwaters, 10% are situated on the downwind side of the islands and the rest formed around the Hallig Islands. In between 1988 and 2001 the area of the salt marshes expanded about 700 ha. Widely natural and use-free salt marshes can be found around the islands and ashore around Schob√ºll and St. Peter-Ording. The whole Wadden Sea is ruled by an Atlantic climate. Strong westerlies and the heat storage capacity are determining factors which often generate strong winds, but at the same time balance the temperatures. Thus occur cold summers (July: 14,5 ¬∞C) and mild winters (January: 1,8 ¬∞C).MLUL pp. 11‚Äì31  Flora and Fauna  Rockworm piles in the Wadden Sea Saltwater, tide and strong winds characterize the environment in the Wadden Sea area. Only extremely specialized organisms can cope with the conditions. Fishes, breeding birds and most of the marine mammals living in the Wadden Sea use it as nursery. Besides that, giant flocks of migratory birds visit the Wadden Sea regularly in spring and fall using it as a food source. In the Wadden Sea of Schleswig-Holstein you can find about 700 plant and 2.500 animal species, of which 10% are endemic. = Plants = Eelgrass is the only flowering plant in the Wadden Sea which is capable of living under water. In 1930 most of the eelgrass in the Atlantic Ocean was killed by an epidemic. The eelgrass stocks haven‚Äôt regenerated since. The plants are mainly located in the northern part of Schleswig-Holstein‚Äôs Wadden Sea and cover an area of 6000 ha. Compared to 705 ha in Lower Saxony and 130 ha in the Netherlands, it is quite large. Also in contrast to the worldwide trend of decreasing eelgrass stocks, the stocks in the Frisian Wadden Sea area are increasing. During the maximum spatial extent in August eelgrass covers up to 13% of the North Frisian Wadden Sea. Eelgrass areas provide habitats for marine organisms and are an important food source for barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis).CWSS pp. 89‚Äì93 Salt marshes make up the biggest part of the National Park's vegetation Salt marshes are the dominant landscape in the transition zone between open sea and inland. They are regularly flooded between 10 ‚Äì 250 times a year depending on the tidal range. Salt marshes build different zones relative to the local salinity. The lower marsh zone which is flooded the most has a higher salinity than the upper marsh zone which is less frequently flooded because of the higher elevation. In total ca. 50 species of flowering plants can be found in the local salt marshes. In low elevation areas plants like common salt marsh grass (Puccinellia maritima), sea-aster (Hordeum marinum), sea-blite (Sueda maritima) and sea-purslane (Halimione portulacoides) are characteristic. High elevation areas are a lot more diverse in plant species. Common plants are seaside centaury (Centaurium littorale), red eyebright (Odontites rubra), see plantain (Plantago maritima) and distant sedge (Carex distans).Schutzstation Wattenmeer: ‚ÄûPflanzen im Watt\\" In the dunes small amounts of plants can be found, due to the extreme conditions only some dune heaths grow there. The rain-laden dune valleys resemble the vegetation of a marsh, with plants like cotton grass (Eriophorum angustifolium), drosera or marsh gentian (Gentiana pneumonanthe). = Animals = Seals use the Wadden Sea as resting and breeding place.  Mammals  A great number of harbour porpoises live in the national park. The Wadden Sea is also home to harbour seals and grey seals. According to the official counting of the National park Administration, about 13.000 harbour seals are living in the Wadden Sea of Schleswig-Holstein (2017). Nearly half of the seal population died during the \\"Seehundstaupe\\" epidemic in 1988 and 2002.Bettina Reineking: Seal epidemic 2002: Information on Dead Seals in the North Sea, Wadden Sea and the Kattegat/Skagerrak Area in 2002. Common Wadden Sea Secretariat, 2003, accessed 10 November 2011. The National Park Administration assumed that one third of the harbour seal population was swimming or hunting during the counting so the number had to be adjusted.Anders Galatius et al.: Aerial surveys of Harbour Seals in the Wadden Sea in 2017. Comman Wadden Sea Secretariat, 2017, accessed 10 November 2017. The grey seal population consists of 140 animals and is mainly located on the \\"Jungnamensand\\" sand bar and the \\"Knobsand\\" sand bars near the island Amrum.Sophie Brasseur et al.: TSEG Grey Seal surveys in the Wadden Sea and Helgoland in 2016 - 2017. Comman Wadden Sea Secretariat, 2017, accessed 10 November 2017.  Insects  The Wadden Sea only has a few places where you can find insects. Nearly all of the 2000 highly specialized species which are known to live in the national park can be found in salt marshes. Due to the difficult environmental conditions (for example salinity or frequent flooding), it is hard to survive for insects, especially in their larvae stadium. The main survival strategy is hiding in the soil or inside plants. As nutrition they prefer parts of the plants that have already released the saltwater. Relatively well known examples are the \\"Halligflieder-Spitzmaus- R√ºsselk√§fer\\" or the \\"Strandwegerichgallr√ºsselk√§fer\\" (Mecinus collaris) that live in the particular plant. In contrast the magnificent salt beetle (Bledius spectabilis) digs a tube in the mudflat.Schutzstation Wattenmeer:‚ÄûTiere\\" Sea lavender serves the caterpillar of the seldom Salzwiesen-Kleinspanner (Scopula emutaria) as nutrition. Its existence can only be proofed in the coastal area of Sylt and Amrum.Manfred Gerstberger: Die Schmetterlingsfauna der Salzstellen Deutschlands, Stand XI/ 2006, accessed 11 March 2007Bilanz und Anmerkungen zur Gef√§hrdungssituation von Schmetterlingen in Schleswig-Holstein, accessed 25 January 2008  Birds  barnacle geese The avifauna of the national park is comparable with avifaunae of other Wadden Sea regions. With over 10 Million birds in spring and fall the trilateral Wadden Sea accommodates the most birds in Europe. The nutrition-rich area is visited by migratory birds regularly. Due to the ongoing changes in the Wadden Sea the effects of the national park on the avifauna are hard to quantify. From 1994 to 2004 only 3 bird species (European spoonbill, Great cormorant, common ringed plover) increased in number. In the same time the stock of 18 other species shrank including barnacle goose, common greenshank, Eurasian curlew, black-headed gull, lesser black-backed gull, Eurasian oystercatcher, pied avocet and dark bellied brent goose.CWSS pp. 94‚Äì100 Artic tern The reason why the stocks are decreasing is unknown. It is presumed that trawling damages the food source of the birds permanently. Species which are mainly living inland seem to have advantage over species which mostly live in salt marshes. They prefer dyked areas, which are cut off from salt water intrusion (polders), so the fresh water environment is dominating. Examples for newly dyked polders in Schleswig- Holstein are Beltringharder Koog, Hauke-Haien-Koog, Speicherkoog, Rickelsb√ºller Koog. Since 2000 breeding eagle pairs settled permanently in the Wadden Sea area.Landesamt 2001 pp. 64‚Äì67 redshank The population of the northwest-european common shelduck, which counts 180.000 birds, spends the time of molting in between July and September in the Wadden Sea, mainly around the protected island of Trischen. Thereby gather over 80% of the northwest- european population.CWSS p. 53 This phenomena of a \\"mass moulting\\" is worldwide unique. About 200.000 eider ducks spend their moulting time here; about 1000 eider duck couples use the mudflat of the North Sea as breeding area. Most of them can be found on the island of Amrum. Huge stocks of barnacle geese (about 60.000) or brent geese (about 84.000) only exist on the islands and Halligen. Additionally can be noticed that the barnacle goose is steadily extending its stay in the Wadden Sea. Around the North Frisian Islands at water depths of 2-10 m the common scoter appears in international meaningful stocks.  Fishes, mussels and shellfishes  The typical mussels of the Wadden Sea are the common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) and the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis). While the common cockle is omnipresent, wild growing blue mussels are less common than in the southern Wadden Sea. They suffer from the expansion of the Pacific oyster which benefit from the warmer winters. The sand gaper was probably introduced by the Vikings from America; the American piddock arrived at the end of the 19th century, while the appearance of the Atlantic jacknife clam in the Wadden Sea is known since 1976. barnacles Of the shellfishes, the common shore crab (Carcinus maenas) has a huge importance, because it devours 10% of the whole Wadden Sea¬¥s biomass. As well numerous brown shrimps and barnacles can be found. Besides the seal the lugworm is probably the most famous animal in the Wadden Sea. Only some small fishes are completely domestic in the mudflat, e.g. eelpout (Zoarces viviparus)', sand goby (Pomatoschistus minutus) and sea scorpion (Myoxocephalus scorpius). A lot of other species use the area rich in food and oxygen and protected of predatory fish as spawning grounds. Especially flatfish like plaices are important to name, but also the garfish (Belone belone), that is active in the eastern part of the Atlantic.  The National Park  Sylt-Nord and Morsum-Kliff are the oldest conservation areas in Schleswig-Holstein. They already exist since 1923. = History = The protection of the Wadden Sea of Schleswig-Holstein is a target on nature conservation since the 20th century. In the 1920s first intentions were made to protect some areas in the Wadden Sea e.g. \\"Sylt-Nord\\" or the Morsum cliff (Sylt). Since 1940 eleven conservation areas were established in North Frisia targeting mainly the protection of animal species, especially birds.Reinhard Schmidt-Moser: ‚Äû75 Jahre Naturschutzgebiete in Schleswig-Holstein\\" During the development of the conservation areas, protecting biotopes became more and more important. In the 1960s first plans were made for conserving the entire area of the Wadden Sea. In 1963 the Wadden Sea Conservation Station demanded a \\"Gro√üschutzgebiet Halligmeer\\" (protection of the area around the small undiked islands off the coast of Schleswig-Holstein). The local hunting association firstly proposed the term national park in relation to the Wadden Sea in 1972, two years after the establishment of the Bavarian Forest National Park. In 1973 the ministry of agriculture proposed a bill which was withdrawn in the next year because of strong resistance by locals.Nationalparkamt Schleswig- Holsteinisches Wattenmeer (Hrsg.): ‚ÄûNationalpark Nachrichten ‚Äì 20 Jahre Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer 1985‚Äì2005\\", T√∂nning 2005 as pdf In 1975 a first scientific conference about the conservation of the Wadden Sea, in 1978 a first trilateral intergovernmental conference with participants form Germany, Netherlands and Denmark took place. In 1982 a joint declaration on the protection of the Wadden Sea was signed in Den Haag by the three states.CWSS pp. 116‚Äì125 But not until 1985 the Wadden Sea was declared a national park due to political tensions with the local population which are caused by a strong traditional desire of freedom by Frisian people. In 1999 the Wadden Sea National Park was further extended again accompanied by political protests. The distinction as a National Park led to protesters throwing eggs at the responsible minister and a shrimp boat demonstration in the Kieler F√∂rde.Frank Zabel: ‚ÄûDas Ende der Debatte?\\" Boyens Medien/Dithmarscher Landeszeitung  First National Park law  The former CDU government founded the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park. It was the third national park in Germany after the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Berchtesgaden National Park. Finally in July of 1985 the Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein adopted the national park law. The declared conservation area covered 272.000 ha, divided into three different zones of protection. The National Park starts 150 m away from the coastline with a seaward extend up to 5 to 10 meters water depths. On 1 October 1985 the national park law inured.Horst Sterr: ‚ÄûNationalparke\\" In 1986 the Lower Saxony, in 1990 the Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park were founded. The Wadden Sea areas in the Netherlands and in Denmark are protected by other conservation measures. The Danish Wadden Sea was declared a national park as well in 2010.Schutzstation Wattenmeer: D√§nisches Wattenmeer ist Nationalpark The national park law says: Old signs of protest against the National Park > ‚ÄûDie Errichtung des Nationalparks dient dem Schutz des schleswig- > holsteinischen Wattenmeeres und der Bewahrung seiner besonderen Eigenart, > Sch√∂nheit und Urspr√ºnglichkeit. Seine artenreiche Pflanzen- und Tierwelt ist > zu erhalten und der m√∂glichst ungest√∂rte Ablauf der Naturvorg√§nge zu > sichern. Jegliche Nutzungsinteressen sind mit dem Schutzzweck im Allgemeinen > und im Einzelfall gerecht abzuw√§gen.‚Äú The main point of the law is that the formation of the national park should protect the animals and plants within it, but as well the natural processes taking place there. Any utilizations of the area have to be weighed with the aim of nature conservation. Local people who were living near the coast and were affected by the national park law felt overlooked by the government. In their mind the Wadden Sea was formed by their ancestors over centuries which somehow led to an attitude of desiring unconditional freedom and autonomy. The National Park Wadden Sea being governed by the \\"far away city\\" Kiel felt like heteronomy by politicians who have no relation to local agriculture, fisheries and had never experienced the danger of storm surges.Legler pp. 209‚Äì212 On the other hand, the political opposition and local nature conservation organizations were skeptical as well. They thought that the restrictions and conservation measures coming with the national park law were not sufficient. They also feared the increasing masses of tourists which the distinctive national park could have caused.  Ecosystem synthesis report, discussion and protests  Environmentalists tried to establish a conservation zone in the Wadden Sea east of Keitum/Sylt, but without success The basis of the second national park law was the Ecosystem synthesis report, published in 1996. Within 800 pages an interdisciplinary team of scientists summarized suggestions for changes in the existing National Park law based on results of 7 years of extensive monitoring in the national park. The synthesis report which was commissioned by the Environment Secretary Berndt Heydemann was discussed in over 200 local assemblies and 15 meetings of national park boards of trustees.Lars M√ºller: New Law for the National Park in Schleswig-Holstein. In: Wadden Sea Newsletter 2000‚Äì1 S. 20‚Äì21 als pdf In 1998 the cabinet of Schleswig-Holstein began to discuss the proposals for the second national park law. In December 1999 it became effective.Horst Sterr:‚ÄûNationalparkgesetz\\" The synthesis report provided suggestions of expanding the area classified as national park up to 349.000 ha compared to the originally 237.000 ha. It also proposed to declare the \\"Lister Tief\\" and the \\"Wesselburener Loch\\" a zero use zone. Beside that driving pleasure crafters in the Dithmarscher Wadden Sea during the moult of common shelducks from July to September got prohibited.Frank Zabel: ‚ÄûDas Ende der Debatte?\\" Boyens Medien/Dithmarscher Landeszeitung The suggestions of the synthesis report caused a great wave of political responses. Especially North Frisian people led by the head of district administrator Olaf Bastian (CDU) were dedicated enemies of an expanding national park. Not only North Frisian people protested against the synthesis report respectively the second National Park Law but other protest movements developed among the people living at the west coast too. In B√ºsum 1.000 people, including many local shepherd working at the dykes and shrimp fisherman, protested because they felt limited in their freedom and negatively affected in their income. On 26 August 1999 143 shrimp fisherman travelled with their ships through the Kiel Canal to the city of Kiel to protest against the second national park law during its declaration in front of the Schleswig- Holstein Landtag. During an event in T√∂nning locals threw eggs at the Secretary of environment Rainder Steenblock. In November 1999, one month before the second national park law became effective, 160 fires got lit all along the West coast of Schleswig-Holstein as a warning act.Horst Sterr: ‚ÄûProteste\\" The protests were mainly about the number and size of the zero use zones in which fishing wouldn¬¥t be allowed, and about the landside border of the park. It should, instead of the 150m band, now border the outer edge of the dykes which included a lot of salt marshes and especially swimming places.  Second national park law  Amongst others the second National Park law established a whale sanctuary for the protection of the common porpoise On 17 December 1999 the Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein changed the national park law according to the proposals of the synthesis report. The protective purpose of the National Park was changed from \\"m√∂glichst ungest√∂rten Ablauf der Naturvorg√§nge\\" (which means an undisturbed ongoing of natural processes) to ‚Äûconserved as a habitat for the plant and animal species that occur in it naturally as well as for the relationships occurring between such species and their habitats\\". Nevertheless coastal protection still has a higher priority than nature conservation. Additionally it is written down that the restriction of the national park shouldn‚Äôt restrain the locals in their interests and habits and that the national park should work to affect the tourism in the North Sea region positively. The law expanded the national park area only seawards.Gesetz zum Schutz des schleswig-holsteinischen Wattenmeeres (Nationalparkgesetz - NPG) vom 17. September 1999 zuletzt ge√§ndert mit Gesetz vom 13. Dezember 2007 (GVOBl. Schl.-H. S. 514)(as pdf; 639 kB) The coastal border stayed the same, 150 meter away from the dyke. A zero use zone was created south of the Hindenburgdamm instead of the originally proposed zero use zones \\"Lister Tief\\" and \\"Wesselburener Loch\\", which would have been ecologically more valuable. Additionally a whale sanctuary was established and hunting got prohibited completely, which had great effects on shellfisheries. The law also simplified the conservation zone system. Conservation zone 3 has gone obsolete while conservation zone 1 was expanded drastically, especially in areas of tidal inlets. Pleasure crafters and fishermen agreed upon avoiding moulting areas of barnacle geese during moult time. The law also proposed speed limitations for ships and boats in the national park area. To control non-official criticism and promote cooperation between locals and politics respectively the National Park Administration the law created countless platforms for task forces and projects. = Administration = The National Park Administration is the responsible nature conservation authority for the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park functioning as a higher and lower conservation authority. The administration office is located in T√∂nning. According to the second national park law article 7 the National Park Administration is responsible for (1.) Informing the public about the national park, conducting educational activities and controlling movements of visitors, as well as for (2.) Carrying out and coordinating ecological monitoring, and providing the necessary relevant scientific basis for planning as well as for (3.) Regulating support provided by nature conservation associations within the meaning of Article 21 d of the state nature conservation act (Landesnaturschutzgesetz) for the national park. Until 2007 the Wadden Sea National Park was administrated by the National Park State Office (Landesamt) which was directly assigned to the Ministry of Nature, Environment and Regional Development (Ministerium f√ºr Natur, Umwelt und Landesentwicklung).Legler pp. 181‚Äì189 Since 1 January 2008 the National Park Administration is integrated in the newly founded Agency of Coastal Defence, National Park and Marine Conservation of Schleswig-Holstein as Department 3: National Park and Marine Conservation. The main reason to unite coastal defence and nature conservation in one agency is to provide a better coordination for overlapping responsibilities of these two departments.NABU Schleswig-Holstein: ‚ÄûBilanz 2005‚Äì2008: Nationalpark schleswig-holsteinisches Wattenmeer\\" Head of Department 3: National Park and Marine Conservation is Dr. Detlef Hansen.Organisationsplan des Landesbetrieb f√ºr K√ºstenschutz, Nationalpark und Meeresschutz Schleswig-Holstein , 1. Januar 2013 A part of the National Park administration's work is to inform the public Although the national park only covers the area of Dithmarschen and North Frisia and borders 69 local communities the state administration of Schleswig-Holstein is responsible for the national park. The state administration justifies its responsibility with high efficiency, standardised administration processes and the minimisation of special local interests. Besides that the biggest part of the national park area is classified as unincorporated area. The local communities have no right for administration in these areas. The administrative districts North Frisia and Dithmarschen and the local communities are members of the boards of trustees which are instruments to pool statements and influence on the national park. 99.9 % of the national park area is public property. 99 % of that is property of the German Federal Republic the rest belongs to the state of Schleswig-Holstein.CWSS p. 115 The National Park Administration employs 85 people, to some extent in part-time jobs. It has a budget of seven million euros per year. With integrating the National Park administration in the Agency for Coastal Defence, National Park and Marine Conservation the \\"Nationalpark Service\\" got integrated in the National Park administration, so only one administration office is in charge of every area of responsibility concerning the National Park. The National Park Administration tries to solve conflicts and work more efficient by making agreements with user groups to manage the details of the Park¬¥s utilization. They negotiate treaties with fishermen, the guides for mudflat tours, the operators of excursion boats, but as well with communities like Sankt Peter- Ording, Westerhever or the Hamburger Hallig. = Other conservation measures = Since 1987 the governments of Denmark, Netherlands and Germany run the Common Wadden Sea Secretariat (CWSS) to provide better coordination of conservation measures. The secretariat is located in Wilhelmshaven. Since 1990 the area of the national park and five Hallig islands additionally own the conservation status of a Biosphere reserve. The waterways in this area are assigned to federal law. The latest act got passed in 1997 and determines the speed limitations and temporal closure of the waterways. Internationally speaking the Wadden Sea of Schleswig-Holstein is subject to the Ramsar- Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. Since 2002 the area is also listed as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA). Additionally the national park is subject to a trilateral convention for protecting grey seals, harbour seals and Cetaceans called ‚ÄòAgreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas‚Äô as well as to the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian migratory water birds.CWSS pp.108‚Äì109 The area is designated for the purpose of the Bird directive of the European Union (79/409/EWG) as well as the for the purpose of the Habitats Directive and therefore a part of the European Natura 2000 nature protection network. As a part of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive the ecological status of the Wadden Sea has to be protected and improved. In the purpose of the Waterframework directive the national park is partly assigned to the Flussgebietseinheit (FGE) Eider, a so called \\"unit of the river basin Eider\\", and partly to the FGE Elbe. Harbour seals are protected in the Wadden Sea by the ‚ÄòAgreement on the Conservation of Seals in the Wadden Sea‚Äô. The 26 July 2009 the Wadden Sea of Schleswig-Holstein received the Status of UNESCO World Heritage together with the Wadden Sea of Lower Saxony and the Netherlands.Wattenmeer-Sekretariat: ‚ÄûThe Wadden Sea has been Nominated as World Heritage Site\\" The adjacent Wadden Sea of Hamburg received the Status in 2011, the National Park Vadehavet in Denmark in 2014.  Human utilisation of the National Park  Two people are living on the Hallig S√ºdfall during summer. Only five people are living inside the National Park, but the bordering communities contain 290.000 inhabitants. Additionally there are about 15 million tourists visiting the National Park every year. The national park has 70 neighbouring communities in Schleswig-Holstein with 290.000 people living there. Additionally approximately 15 Million people visit the national park every year.Mehrwert plus - Die Bedeutung des Tourismus f√ºr die Region und zentrale Herausforderungen f√ºr den Tourismus an der Westk√ºste. Nordsee- Tourismus-Service GmbH (NTS), M√§rz 2014, accessed 24 November 2017. The area of the Wadden Sea National Park is harnessed by tourism, fishery, oil production, coastal defence, grazing, maritime traffic and air traffic, withdrawal of gravel and sand, mussel cultivation and sometimes used for military weapon testing. Most of the utilisation is located directly near or at the coast, so the seaward area is more or less unaffected by human influences. Since the amendment of the second national park law in 1999 mainly voluntary agreements coordinate the limitation in human utilisation of the Wadden Sea. The consideration of traditional usages highly increased the approval of the national park by locals.Legler pp. 212‚Äì221 Since 1987 utilisations, which hardly affect the ecosystem Wadden Sea at all, are allowed again by law. Such utilisations are e.g. collecting small amounts of plants for science or education. = Approval of the Wadden Sea National Park by locals and tourists = The National Park Administration commissions a monitoring program called \\"S√ñM Watt\\" (Sozio-√∂konomisches Monitoring) regularly. In the S√ñM Watt report, data about the regional economy, the demographic developments, opinions and wishes of the local population are gathered and analysed. The results of the monitoring program shows that tourists are at least as well informed about the national park as locals. In a representative survey all over Germany the Wadden Sea National Park was placed second in terms of publicity, right behind the Bavarian Forest National Park, which was the first place. Despite being famous in the public awareness, only a few people distinguish (without help) between Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park, Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park and Lower Saxony Wadden Sea National Park.Christiane G√§tje: Sozio-√∂konomisches Monitoring in der Nationalpark-Region - S√ñM-Bericht 2017. LKN.SH - Nationalparkverwaltung, 2017, accessed 24 November 2017. Besides being highly approved by tourists, the surveys suggest that locals have high rates of consent for the Wadden Sea National Park as well. According to the S√ñM report 2017 about 85 % of the population of Dithmarschen and North Frisia would vote for a continuation of the national park.Christiane G√§tje: Sozio-√∂konomisches Monitoring (S√ñM WATT) in der Nationalpark-Region - S√ñM Bericht 2017. LKN.SH - Nationalparkverwaltung, 2017, accessed 13 November 2017. Since 2009 the approval rates haven‚Äôt gone below 80 %. 10 % of the samples would vote for a continuation under certain circumstances. Only 2 % would vote against a continuation of the Wadden Sea National Park. Locals, who would have voted against the national park, fear further limitations for example in fishery, aquatic sports and accessibility of the conservation area. However most of the samples show comprehension for specific conservation measures. In the survey of the S√ñM report 2014 36 % of locals said they are proud to have the Wadden Sea National Park. Additionally 52 % think the existence of the national park is important.Christiane G√§tje: Sozio-√∂konomisches Monitoring (S√ñM Watt) in der Nationalpark-Region - S√ñM Bericht 2015. LKN.SH - Nationalparkverwaltung, 2015, accessed 13 November 2017. Women and young adults evaluate it more positively than men and elder persons. It is hard to quantify the effects of the communication and education efforts of the National Park Administration with the locals. The administration has trouble in limiting the agriculture in the national park area, mainly because there hasn‚Äôt been much agriculture in the first place before the Wadden Sea National Park was founded. Also, even 32 years after the creation of the national park, only 14 % of the local people actually know that the Wadden Sea area which they are living adjacent to has the conservation status of a national park. The public awareness of the Wadden Sea being a biosphere reserve is < 1 %. = Coastal defence = Coastal defence has a higher priority than nature conservation measurements, even in the national park area. Along the North Sea coast new dikes are being built and old dikes will be amplified according to the sea level rise. In some areas, e.g. at the west coast of Sylt eroded beach material is replaced through beach nourishment. But compared to other marine national parks coastal defence has always been a part of the Wadden Sea. The Wadden Sea wouldn‚Äôt be the same today if not for coastal protection over centuries. For example drainage channels were dug in the Dark Age in salt marsh areas. Even today the channels change the originally amphibious character of the biotope. In the past land reclamation was the number one priority for the people during the first settlements. Nowadays only small areas of land reclamation are planned (due to nature conservation) mainly for increasing the stability in foreshore areas for better flood protection. = Tourism = During a mudflat hiking tour visitors can discover the National Park The national park law says that nature conservation in the national park area shall support sustainable development of living and working conditions for locals.Gesetz zum Schutz des schleswig-holsteinischen Wattenmeeres (Nationalparkgesetz - NPG). LKN SH - Nationalparkverwaltung, 2009, accessed 27 November 2017. The goal is reached by positive backlash on tourism and reputation of the region. The location of the Wadden Sea National Park is a traditionally popular destination for German tourists. The official statistics show that 1.5 million holidaymakers generate 8.4 million overnight stays in the adjacent coastal area, islands and Hallig islands. One can assume that unofficial numbers are much higher because the official statistics don‚Äôt include private renting with less than 10 beds to sleep in, long-time camping, and staying overnight in houses / flats of relatives or friends. Another number which is hard to quantify are the daily visitors. To determine a total number of tourists the researchers combine official counting with other representative surveys with topics related to tourism in the North Sea region. Over all 18.7 million overnight stays are recorded as well as 12.8 million daily visitors. Approximately 9.000 people in the North Sea region are working in the tourist sector.  North Sea tourism in the Wadden Sea National Park area  Mudflat excursion around Langeness with the Wadden Sea Conservation Station The surveillance of the national park area is hard to manage for the National Park Administration. The number of tourists is too big; the area of the national park too large and the number of employees responsible for supervising tourists is too low. Additionally tourists do not have a few main entrances as in other German national parks, but the entrances to the Wadden Sea National Park are large in number through the dike areas. The National Park Administration cooperates with local communities and nature conservation organisations to close the surveillance gap. Most of the time tourists who are visiting the national park stay out of the park itself. Normally the groups of tourists entering the national park are guided walking tours in the mudflat areas. The number of private walking tours is unknown. On the other hand the number of guided walking tours reached a maximum of 5.900 tours with a total of 149.000 participants attending in 2016, a number which has not been reached since 1999. Around 2/3 of the tours are guided and organised by members of the Wadden Sea Conservation Station. The remainder are guided by professional mudflat guides.S√ñM-Bericht 2008  National Park tourism  Multimar Wattforum is the most important information center of the National Park with about 200.000 visitors per year It is unknown to which degree the status of the national park increased the number of tourists in the North Sea region. Compared to administrative districts which are not located adjacent to the national park region, the increasing rate of tourists in administrative districts adjacent to the Wadden Sea National Park is not significantly higher. However in 2014 17 % of the people making a vacation in the North Sea area decided to go there because of the national park, suggests the S√ñM report.Christiane G√§tje: Sozio- √∂konomisches Monitoring in der Nationalpark-Region - S√ñM-Bericht 2014. LKN.SH - Nationalparkverwaltung, 2014, accessed 24 November 2017 These tourists generate a net product of 89 Million euros which is the income equivalent of 4741 people.Hubert Job: Regionalwirtschaftliche Effekte des Nationalparks Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer. 2013, accessed 27 November 2017 As a part of the INTERREG IV B-project PROWAD another survey was made asking people to which degree the status of a national park influenced their decision during vacation planning to travel to the North Sea region. About 44 % answered that they think the conservation of the Wadden Sea was a \\"very important\\" or an \\"important\\" factor for choosing their vacation destination. The National Park Administration is responsible for public relation (PR) topics of the national park. A part of the PR program is their visitor information system. It consists of pavilions, information boards, maps, signs and guides. Meanwhile approximately 750 items are located in 250 places all over the coast of Schleswig-Holstein. Since 1999 the National Park Administration operates a main information centre in the town of T√∂nning called ‚ÄòMultimar Wattforum‚Äô. Besides that other bigger information centers are located in Wyk on F√∂hr Island and Husum (Nationalparkhaus) whereas 30 smaller information centers of the national park can be found all around the coast. The smaller information centers are operated by nature conservation associations or local communities. Other tourist attractions which also provide information about the national park and the World Heritage status are the \\"Seehundstation Friedrichskoog\\" and the \\"Erlebniszentrum Naturgewalten List\\" (Sylt). The National Park Partner Programme was initiated of the National Park Administration in 2003  National Park partner initiative of the Wadden Sea National Park  The National Park Partner Project was founded in 2003 by the National Park Administration.Watt sind Nationalpark-Partner. LKN.SH - Nationalparkverwaltung, accessed 7 December 2017. Since then local touristic businesses can apply for a National Park Partnership. The idea behind the project is that tourists who plan a vacation in the North Sea region get a package made of quality service, practised \\"regionality\\" and ecological awareness.Watt f√ºr eine Region! LKN.SH - Nationalparkverwaltung, accessed 7 December 2017 They also support sustainable touristic development in the National Park region. The project promotes cooperation between local communities, nature conservation associations and the National Park Administration. The central panel of the National Park Partner Project is the \\"Vergaberat\\" deciding over which applicant gets accepted and may enter the National Park Partner Network. The \\"Vergaberat\\" consists of the representatives from the Island and Hallig Island conference (Insel- und Halligkonferenz), nature conservation associations, National Park Partners, the Nordsee-Tourismus-Service GmbH and the National Park Administration. The head of the \\"Vergaberat\\" is Anja Szczesinski (World Wide Fund for Nature), the chief executive is Matthias Kundy (National Park Administration). Companies and businesses who want to apply for a National Park Partnership have to fulfil a catalogue of criteria in the fields of identification with the idea of a national park, ecological awareness and service quality. Currently over 170 partners are part of the network. The partners are categorised for example in apartments, hotels, professional mud flat guides, shipping companies or museum. The National Park Partnership is fee-based. At the moment there are 27 \\"Nationale Naturlandschaften\\" (German national nature reserves) partner initiatives with over 1000 partnerships. They organise themselves in a committee of the Europarc Deutschland e.V.Dachverband der nationalen Naturlandschaften. Europarc Deutschland, accessed 7 December 2017 For having a comprehensive quality standard the committee developed a harmonised catalogue of criteria for National Park Partners. = Fishery, hunting and agriculture = Traditional shrimp boats The coexistence of the national park and fishery has conflict potential. While only being a small part of the national product of the west coast (ca. 1%), fishery is highly important for tourism. Tourists expect a maritime flare when having a vacation at the North Sea coast. Shrimp fishery has the biggest economic importance as a part of fishery in the North Sea region because fishing common shrimps (Crangon crangon) is not limited by catch quota. On the other hand Atlantic cod, European plaice and common sole are hardly fished at all due to strict catch quota and other protection measures.Bericht der Landesregierung √ºber die Situation und Entwicklung der Fischerei in Nord- und Ostsee sowie die Binnen- und Teichfischerei. Drucksache 15/452 des Schleswig-Holsteinischen Landtags as pdf Agriculture has a higher economic importance for the North Sea coast. But most of the land used for agriculture is located outside the national park. Only grazing of saltmarshes by sheep happens inside the park and has conflict potential to some extent.MLUL pp. 35‚Äì43  Shrimp fishery  Shrimpers support the characteristic image of the North Sea region of Schleswig-Holstein as it counts as traditional fishery. Not until 1900 shrimp boats were used for catching shrimps, prior to which a Gliep net was the standard fishing method.Krabbenfischerei. LKN.SH - Nationalparkverwaltung, accessed 7 December 2017. The shrimper stock in Schleswig-Holstein declined over the years: in 1999 about 144 shrimp boats were fishing in the North Sea. In 2016 the stock has dropped to half. Small family businesses are affected the most. Against the odds the number of big industrial shrimp boats in the North Sea region is increasing. They can stay outside longer, as well as in bad weather. From 2010 to 2015 about 6.000 tons of common shrimps a year were caught. In 2016 the number decreased to 2.530 tons, which is unusually small.Fischerblatt 2017. accessed 7 December 2017.  Mussel fishery  Common blue mussels are cultivated in an area with an extension of 1.700 ha in the North Sea area.MELUND: Amtsblatt f√ºr Schleswig-Holstein 2017. Hrsg.: MELUND. Ausgabe 3, April 2017. Seeds (young mussels) for cultivation can be extracted from natural spat falls and \\"seed collectors\\".Robert Habeck et al: Eckpunktevereinbarung zur Miesmuschelkulturwirtschaft im Nationalpark Schleswig - Holsteinisches Wattenmeer. 2015, accessed 24 November 2017. Catching common blue mussels outside cultivated areas is strictly forbidden. The cultivation of common mussels in the conservation zone 2 of the national park is limited to an area of 13 ha. Since 1997 areas that dry out during low tide are closed for mussel cultivation as well. In total only 8 common mussel cultivation areas in the national park region are allowed by law. On average approximately 10.000 tons of common mussels are harvested. From the beginning of April until mid of June harvesting is generally prohibited.Fischerblatt 2015. 2015, accessed 24 November 2017.Fischerblatt 2016. 2016, accessed 24 November 2017.Fischerblatt 2017. 2017, accessed 24 November 2017. Catching common cockle and common razor shells is prohibited since 1990. Even before the prohibition, it was economically unimportant due to natural stock decreases in Schleswig-Holstein during hard winter seasons.CWSS pp. 62‚Äì66 Pacific oyster (Magallan gigas) cultivations are limited to a 30 ha big area near Sylt. These oysters are kept in heated ponds during winter. About 1 million oysters are harvested and sold on Sylt annually; approximately one third is eaten local. The Pacific oyster has widely spread in the Wadden Sea during the last years. The former blue mussel beds evolved into oyssel reefs.Reise, K. C. Buschbaum, H. B√ºttger, K. M. Wegner (2017): Invading oysters and native mussels: from hostile takeover to compatible bedfellows. Ecosphere (8)9: e01949.10.1002/ecs2.1949 Attempts to catch the thick trough shell (Spisula solida) were successful in the beginning of the 1990s. During the hard winter in 1995/96 all the shells fell victim to the unusual cold weather. Since the end of 2016 thick trough shell fishery is prohibited in the national park.  Aquaculture and hunting  An experimental station for marine aquaculture is located in B√ºsum. The plants water supply with North Sea water comes through a pipeline which begins in the national park.CWSS pp. 100‚Äì107 While hunting in the national park area is prohibited since 1999, some hunters are still active on the Hallig Islands which are surrounded by national park conservation zones.  Agriculture  Especially barnacle geese are held responsible for feeding damages in the surrounding areas of the farmer's fields Besides tourism agriculture is the most important source of income for the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein. Especially southern Dithmarschen has been and still is an important agricultural export area. While most of the agriculture happens outside of the national park area (except for sheep farming), it still has some influence on the national park, for example water travels through Gr√ºppen (drainage channels) from the fields into the North Sea. Only sheep grazing on salt marshes happens to be a problem with agriculture and the national park. Since the first settlements salt marshes were used for grazing and sheep farming. Since the 1980s intensive grazing got subsidised by the government of Schleswig-Holstein. Nowadays only dikes itself and the dike foreshore areas shall be intensively grazed because of coastal defence manners. Salt marshes which are located more seawards shall be spared out. From 1991 to 1996, shepherds received compensation for relinquishing the intensive grazing of seaward salt marshes as a part of the \\"K√ºstenstreifen-Programm\\". In the disused salt marshes water drainage got stopped as well. Because of these measures the salt marshes stock increased up to 13.5 % at the coasts of North Frisia and Dithmarschen in the years from 1988 to 2014.Wanner, A., Stock, M., Jensen, K.: Salzmarschen im Nationalpark Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer - Vegetationsver√§nderungen in den letzten 20 Jahren. Hrsg.: Natur und Landschaft. Nr. 89. Natur und Landschaft, 2014, S. 17‚Äì25. With a total area of 12.450 ha (2006), 47 % of the salt marshes were not grazed at all, 11 % were grazed extensively and 38 % were grazed intensively. Nearly all of the offered shipping traffic in the National Park is for tourists. A lot of shipping companies cooperate with the National Park administration = Transport and infrastructure = There are some small and medium sized harbours (Meldorf, B√ºsum, Husum, Nordstrand, Pellworm, Dageb√ºll, Wyk auf F√∂hr, Amrum, H√∂rnum and List auf Sylt) located at the coast of Schleswig Holstein. The only possibility to reach them is driving through the national park. Responsible for most of the marine traffic are ferries driving to the North Frisian Islands. The ferry traffic routes go through shipping channels in the national park area. A special decree on moving through the Wadden Sea by the Federal Government of Germany applies to the maritime area of the national park shipping channels. The decree allows for example temporal closure of conservation zones for the protection of breeding birds and grey seals or bans on driving during low tide. The seaward part of the national park is signed as a PSSA (Particularly Sensitive Sea Area). The marking also provides extra limitations for marine traffic especially for ships with dangerous loads. These ships are forced to take other routes (more seawards) outside of the PSSA. Very important shipping routes, like the Elbe estuary route to Hamburg are an exception. Adler-Express is a fast ferry to the islands. It isn¬¥t certified as National Park Partner. Due to its high velocities sea mammals are endangered to have too little time to escape. The area of the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park is located north of a strongly frequented waterway in the southern North Sea. Changing weather conditions, strong storms and limited range of sight are pretty common for the region, so naval accidents are ongoing hazards for the flora and fauna of the national park. But more common than naval accidents are oil-polluted birds due to captains illegally dumping oil into the sea close to the national park. The biggest threat the national park ever experienced happened on 29 October 1998 when the cargo ship MV Pallas, on fire and abandoned, ran aground near the island Amrum. Approximately 244 tons of oil flew into the North Sea.Bericht zum Ungl√ºck bei waddensea-secretariat.org (PDF, Archivversion) Because of being completely surrounded by the national park area, the supply chain of the islands and Hallig islands goes through the national park inevitably. Besides the supply transported by ships, other essentials like energy, data or water pipes lead through the national park as well. Also civic air traffic is passing over the national park area. = Oil, offshore wind power and sand = The only operating offshore oil platform of Germany \\"Mittelplate A\\" is located adjacent to Trischen Island in the national park area. It exploits the most considerable oilfield of Germany since 1987 in up to 2000 ‚Äì 3000 meter water depth. The obtained oil was originally transported by oil tankers to Brunsb√ºttel but since 2005 the oil is carried away by an underground pipeline. Besides the obvious disturbing factors for the environment, noise level and lighting are considerable disturbances for the breeding birds as well. Construction of the pipeline to connect Mittelplate A and land The construction of further oil platforms is prohibited by national park law and the Trilateral Wadden Sea Cooperation (TWSC). It is assumed that further oil fields are located in the south of the operated field near the Elbe River and in the salt domes around B√ºsum and Oldenswort. It is unknown if it‚Äôs possible to exploit the oil fields from stations outside the national park area but it‚Äôs pretty unlikely that they can be tapped by the Mittelplate A. The operating concern of the \\"Mittelplate A\\" RWE Dea requested 5 additional exploratory drilling in the national park area. The responsible mining authority gave the permission but according to an inspection by the Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein it is illegitimate. The political discourse still goes on today.Schutzstation Wattenmeer: Etappensieg gegen √ñlf√∂rderung, 12.August 2008 Wind energy in Schleswig-Holstein is only won by onshore wind parks, which are built in the coastal region bordering the national park. First economical important offshore wind farms are planned seawards outside the national park. The sea cable connection from the offshore wind farms to land might cause some disturbances while being built.Julia Schmid: Regional√∂konomische Wirkungen von Gro√üschutzgebieten.

The military testing area in the southern part of Meldorf Bay is still active but it‚Äôs not used for testing bombs and napalm anymore, like in the past. In the 1960s arm manufacturers tested munitions and projectiles while aiming at the Wadden Sea during 130 days a year, heavily disturbing the local fauna. The projectiles had been salvaged with the help of helicopters. Nowadays companies are still allowed to test ammunition in the military testing area near the Wadden Sea during two days a year.Nationalparkamt Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer (Hrsg.): ‚ÄûJahresbericht 2003/2004 des Nationalparkamtes\\", T√∂nning 2005 Additionally military training flights are located within the national park area regularly. The aircraft aren‚Äôt allowed to come below a flying altitude of 900 m. It is mostly unknown how much ammunition from World War 2 is still located in the Wadden Sea of Schleswig-Holstein. The German marine plunged the remaining munition mostly undocumented in the mudflats. Although most of the munition seems to be dumped in the Lower Saxony part of the Wadden Sea, it is assumed that a total mass of 400.000 ‚Äì 1.300.000 tons can be found in the Schleswig- Holstein Wadden Sea. The exact locations of the plunged munitions are mostly unknown. Only some places west of Sylt are known to be used as munition graveyards. Due to corrosion heavy pollutants might be set free in the environment. Tourists and fishermen are in great danger when they unluckily come in contact with ammunition remains.Stefan Nehring: ‚ÄûR√ºstungsaltlasten in den deutschen K√ºstengew√§ssern ‚Äì Handlungsempfehlungen zur erfolgreichen Umsetzung der Europ√§ischen-Wasserrahmenrichtlinie‚Äú in Rostocker Meeresbiologische Beitr√§ge Heft 14, Rostock 2005 p. 109‚Äì123 (as pdf)  See also  *Wadden Sea National Parks *Lower Saxony Wadden Sea National Park *Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park  Literature  * Common Wadden Sea Secretariat (CWSS) (Hrsg.): Nomination of the Dutch-German Wadden Sea as World Heritage Site. 2008 als PDF * Landesamt f√ºr den Nationalpark Schleswig- Holsteinisches Wattenmeer (Hrsg.): Wattenmeermonitoring 2000 ‚Äì Schriftenreihe des Nationalparks Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer, Sonderheft, T√∂nning 2001 * Landesamt f√ºr den Nationalpark Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer (Hrsg.): S√ñM-Bericht 2008 als pdf * Landesamt f√ºr den Nationalpark Schleswig- Holsteinisches Wattenmeer / Landesamt f√ºr den Nationalpark Nieders√§chsisches Wattenmeer / Umweltbundesamt (Hrsg.): Umweltatlas Wattenmeer.

It is an exclave of the city state of Hamburg in North Germany and lies 12.5 km off Cuxhaven in the estuary of the Elbe in the North Sea (German Bight) and includes the islands of Neuwerk, Scharh√∂rn and Nigeh√∂rn. It is made up mainly of sand and mixed mudflats with shallow creeks, sand bars (Plaaten) and the aforementioned dune islands.  National park  In accordance with a ruling by the Hamburg Parliament on 9 April 1990 the area was reclassified as the Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park. On 5 April 2001 the law was updated and the national park area expanded as a result. The total area of the national park (Zones 1 and 2) is . The Zone 1 areas are under special protection. Thus, for example mudflat hiking and horse and carriage rides are only permitted on designated routes. Within the national park there are about 2,000 species of animal, of which about 250 only occur in the salt marshes of the Wadden Sea. Of particular note are the common seal and the gray seal. Due to the natural influx of sediment, there is a high concentration of food for young fish and seabirds at the mouth of the Elbe. The national park is therefore an important resting and moulting area for seabirds. For example, shelducks live on the snails that are found in hundreds of thousands on the surface of the mudflats. The approximately 180,000 birds of the north-western shelduck population spends also their moulting period from July to September in the Wadden Sea, which is protected by the three national parks in the states of Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg. About 200,000 eider ducks also spend their moulting season here; about 1,000 pairs of eiders also use the mudflats of the North Sea as a breeding area. Most of them breed on the island of Amrum. At the same time, the Wadden Sea is a resting place for breeding birds from northern climes that eat up the fat reserves they need for successful breeding. As a result, there are about 10-12 million waders, geese, ducks and gulls in the Wadden Sea as a whole. The park works closely with the Jordsand Society (Verein Jordsand) especially in the area of bird conservation.  Biosphere reserve  Since 1992 the national park has also been designated as a biosphere reserve, something which increases the importance of the park, because since then it has been placed under international protection in accordance with the UNESCO programme, \\"man and biosphere\\". The national park management is responsible for the care of the biosphere reserve and its national aspects.

Kos is the third largest island of the Dodecanese by area, after Rhodes and Karpathos; it has a population of 53,388 (2019census), making it the second most populous of the Dodecanese, after Rhodes. The island measures . Administratively, Kos constitutes a municipality within the Kos regional unit, which is part of the South Aegean region. The principal town of the island and seat of the municipality is Kos Town.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior Name The name Kos (, genitive Œö·ø∂)Liddell et al., A Greek‚ÄìEnglish Lexicon, s.v. is first attested in the Iliad, and has been in continuous use since. Other ancient names include Meropis, Cea,Pliny cites Staphylus of Naucratis for this name in the Natural History 5:36 , but Peck apparently misinterprets Staphylus as a name of Kos and Nymphaea.Harry Thurston Peck, Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities, 1898, s.v. Cos In many Romance languages, Kos was formerly known as Stancho, Stanchio, or Stinco, and in Ottoman and modern Turkish it is known as ƒ∞stank√∂y, all from the reinterpretation of the Greek expression ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œöœâ 'to Kos';C.S. Sonnini, Travels in Greece and Turkey, undertaken by order of Louis XVI, and with the authority of the Ottoman court, London, 1801, 1 [ p. 212] cf. the similar Istanbul and Stimpoli, Crete. Under the rule of the Knights Hospitaller of Rhodes, it was known as Lango or Lang√≤, presumably because of its length.A handbook for travellers in Greece, Murray's Handbooks, 4th edition, London, 1872, [ p. 364]H.J.A. Sire, The Knights of Malta, Yale, 1996, , [ p. 34] In The Travels of Sir John Mandeville, the author misunderstands this and treats Lango and Kos as distinct islands.Anthony Bale, trans., The Book of Marvels and Travels, Oxford 2012, , [ p. 15] and footnote In Italian, the island is known as Coo. A person from Kos is called a \\"Koan\\" in English. The word is also an adjective, as in \\"Koan goods\\".Kos Island Today . Kosisland.gr. Geography Kos is in the Aegean Sea. Its coastline is long and it extends from west to east. The island has several promontories, some with names known in antiquity: Cape Skandari, anciently Scandarium or Skandarion in the northeast; Cape Lacter or Lakter in the south; and Cape Drecanum or Drekanon in the west. In addition to the main town and port, also called Kos, the main villages of Kos island are Kardamena, Kefalos, Tingaki, Antimachia, Mastihari, Marmari and Pyli. Smaller ones are Zia, Zipari, Platani, Lagoudi and Asfendiou. Municipality The present municipality of Kos was created in 2011 with the merger of three municipalities, which became municipal units: *Dikaios *Irakleides *Kos The municipality has an area of 290,313 km2, and has a municipal unit of 67.200 km2. Economy Tourism is the main industry in Kos, the island's beaches being the primary attraction. The main port and population centre on the island, Kos town, is also the tourist and cultural centre, with whitewashed buildings including many hotels, restaurants and a number of nightclubs forming the Kos town \\"barstreet\\". The seaside village of Kardamena is a popular resort for young holidaymakers (primarily from the United Kingdom and Scandinavia) and has a large number of bars and nightclubs. Farming is the second principal occupation, with the main crops being grapes, almonds, figs, olives, and tomatoes, along with wheat and corn. Cos lettuce (romaine lettuce) is named after the island, from where it is said to have originated. \\"Etymology: The name (Greek Œö·ø∂œÇ) of an island in the √Ügean.\\" \\"In full cos lettuce. A variety of lettuce introduced from the island of Cos. History An Ancient Roman mosaic depicting the Abduction of Europa in the House of Europa in the Western Archaeological Zone of Kos town View of the Asclepeion Ruins of the Ancient Gymnasion Odeon Nerantzia Castle (Hospitalier period) =Mycenaean Era= In Homer's Iliad, a contingent of Koans fought for the Greeks in the Trojan War.Iliad ii.676, from \\"Kos, the city of Eurypylus, and the Calydnae isles\\", under the leaders Phidippos and Antiphos, \\"sons of the Thessalian king\\". It is unclear whether Homer is describing cultural affiliations of his own time or remembered traditions of Mycenaean times. In classical mythology the founder-king of Kos was Merops, hence \\"Meropian Kos\\" is included in the archaic Delian amphictyony listed in the 7th-century Homeric hymn to Delian Apollo; the island was visited by Heracles.Hercules in Kos . Kosinfo.gr. The island was originally colonised by the Carians. The Dorians invaded it in the 11th century BC, establishing a Dorian colony with a large contingent of settlers from Epidaurus, whose Asclepius cult made their new home famous for its sanatoria. The other chief sources of the island's wealth lay in its wines and, in later days, in its silk manufacture.Money, Power And Gender:Evidence For Influential Women Represented And Sculpture On Kos . None. =Archaic Era= Its early history‚Äìas part of the religious-political amphictyony that included Lindos, Kamiros, Ialysos, Cnidus and Halicarnassus, the Dorian Hexapolis (hexapolis means six cities in Greek),The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites (eds. Richard Stillwell, et al.), s.v. \\"Kos\\".‚Äìis obscure. At the end of the 6th century, Kos fell under Achaemenid domination but rebelled after the Greek victory at the Battle of Mycale in 479. =Classical Era= During the Greco- Persian Wars, before it twice expelled the Persians, it was ruled by Persian- appointed tyrants, but as a rule it seems to have been under oligarchic government. In the 5th century, it joined the Delian League, and, after the revolt of Rhodes, it served as the chief Athenian station in the south-eastern Aegean (411‚Äì407). In 366 BC, a democracy was instituted. In 366 BC, the capital was transferred from Astypalaea (at the west end of the island near the modern village of Kefalos) to the newly built town of Cos, laid out in a Hippodamian grid. After helping to weaken Athenian power, in the Social War (357-355 BC), it fell for a few years to the king Mausolus of Caria. Proximity to the east gave the island first access to imported silk thread. Aristotle mentions silk weaving conducted by the women of the island. Silk production of garments was conducted in large factories by female slaves. =Hellenistic Era= During the course of the Fourth War of the Diadochi Ptolemy I Soter captures Kos from Antigonus I Monophthalmus, incorporating it into his kingdom. In the Hellenistic period, Kos attained the zenith of its prosperity. Kos was valued by the Ptolemies, who used it as a naval outpost to oversee the Aegean. As a seat of learning, it arose as a provincial branch of the museum of Alexandria, and became a favorite resort for the education of the princes of the Ptolemaic dynasty. During the Hellenistic age, there was a medical school; however, the theory that this school was founded by Hippocrates (see below) during the Classical age is an unwarranted extrapolation.Vincenzo Di Benedetto: Cos e Cnido, in: Hippocratica - Actes du Colloque hippocratique de Paris 4-9 septembre 1978, ed. M. D. Grmek, Paris 1980, 97-111, see also Antoine Thivel: Cnide et Cos ? : essai sur les doctrines m√©dicales dans la collection hippocratique, Paris 1981 (passim), ; cf. the review by Otta Wenskus (on JSTOR). It was the home of the major Hellenistic poet-scholar Philitas. Kos also became a center of production of unrefined silk, oars and amphorae. Kos economic development during the period can further be exemplified by the 3rd and 2nd century BC construction of a theater, a new market with multiple stoas, a temple to Apollo at Alisarna, construction and expansion of the Asclepeion, fortification works at Alisarna and multiple richly decorated houses. In 240 BC, Ziaelas of Bithynia, Seleucus II Callinicus and Ptolemy III Euergetes provided guarantees for the transformation of Kos Asclepeion into an asylum. This decision made Kos a more attractive destination for merchants and pilgrims. Diodorus Siculus (xv. 76) and Strabo (xiv. 657) describe it as a well-fortified port. Its position gave it a high importance in Aegean trade; while the island itself was rich in wines of considerable fame.Pliny, xxxv. 46 Under Alexander the Great and the Ptolemies the town developed into one of the great centers in the Aegean; Josephus\\"Ant.\\" xiv. 7, ¬ß 2 quotes Strabo to the effect that Mithridates I of the Bosporus was sent to Kos to fetch the gold deposited there by queen Cleopatra of Egypt. Herod is said to have provided an annual stipend for the benefit of prize-winners in the athletic games,Josephus, \\"B. J.\\" i. 21, ¬ß 11 and a statue was erected there to his son Herod the Tetrarch (\\"C. I. G.\\" 2502 ). Paul briefly visited Kos according to . =Roman Era= Except for occasional incursions by corsairs and some severe earthquakes, the island's peace has rarely been disturbed. Following the lead of its larger neighbour, Rhodes, Kos generally displayed a friendly attitude toward the Romans; in 53 AD it was made a free city. It was known in antiquity for the manufacture of transparent light dresses, the coae vestes. The island of Kos also featured a provincial library during the Roman period. The island first became a center for learning during the Ptolemaic dynasty, and Hippocrates, Apelles, Philitas and possibly Theocritus came from the area. An inscription lists people who made contributions to build the library in the 1st century AD. One of the people responsible for the library's construction was the Kos doctor Gaius Stertinius Xenophon, who lived in Rome and was the personal physician of the Emperors Tiberius, Claudius, and Nero. =Byzantine Era= The bishopric of Kos was a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Rhodes. Its bishop Meliphron attended the First Council of Nicaea in 325. Eddesius was one of the minority Eastern bishops who withdrew from the Council of Sardica in about 344 and set up a rival council at Philippopolis. Iulianus went to the synod held in Constantinople in 448 in preparation for the Council of Chalcedon of 451, in which he participated as a legate of Pope Leo I, and he was a signatory of the joint letter that the bishops of the Roman province of Insulae sent in 458 to Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian with regard to the killing of Proterius of Alexandria. Dorotheus took part in a synod in 518. Georgius was a participant of the Third Council of Constantinople in 680‚Äì681. Constantinus went to the Photian Council of Constantinople (879).Raymond Janin, v. Cos in Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de G√©ographie eccl√©siastiques, vol. XIII, Paris 1956, coll. 927-928Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae , Leipzig 1931, p. 448 Under Byzantine rule, apart from the participation of its bishops in councils, the island's history remains obscure. It was governed by a droungarios in the 8th‚Äì9th centuries, and seems to have acquired some importance in the 11th and 12th centuries: Nikephoros Melissenos began his uprising here, and in the middle of the 12th century, it was governed by a scion of the ruling Komnenos dynasty, Nikephoros Komnenos. Today the ecclesiastical metropolis of Kos remains under the direct authority of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, rather than the Church of Greece, and is also listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 875 Following the Fourth Crusade, Kos passed under Genoese control, although it was retaken in ca. 1224 and kept for a while by the Empire of Nicaea. In the 1320s, Kos nominally formed part of the realm of Martino Zaccaria, but was most likely in the hands of Turkish corsairs until ca. 1337, when the Knights Hospitaller took over the island. The last Hospitaller governor of the island was Piero de Ponte. =Ottoman Era= The Ottoman Empire captured the island in early 1523. The Ottomans ruled Kos until 1911. According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the kaza of Kos (Istank√∂y) had a total population of 12,965, consisting of 10,459 Greeks, 2,439 Muslims and 67 Jews.Kemal Karpat (1985), Ottoman Population, 1830-1914, Demographic and Social Characteristics, The University of Wisconsin Press, p. 130-131 =Italian Rule= Kos was transferred to the Kingdom of Italy in 1912 after the Italo-Turkish War. The Italians developed the infrastructures of the island, after the ruinous earthquake of 23 April 1933, which destroyed a great part of the old city and damaged many new buildings. Architect Rodolfo Petracco drew up the new city plan, transforming the old quarters into an archaeological park, and dividing the new city into a residential, an administrative, and a commercial area.,G. Rocco, M. Livadiotti, Il piano regolatore di Kos del 1934: un progetto di citt√† archeologica, \\"Thiasos\\", 1, 2012, pp. 10-2 In World War II, the island, as Italian possession, was part of the Axis. It was controlled by Italian troops until the Italian surrender in 1943. On that occasion, 100 Italian officers who had refused to join the Germans were executed in what became known as the Massacre of Kos. British and German forces then clashed for control of the island in the Battle of Kos as part of the Dodecanese Campaign, in which the Germans were victorious. German troops occupied the island until 1945, when it became a protectorate of the United Kingdom, which ceded it to Greece in 1947 following the Paris peace treaty. Geology The island is part of a chain of mountains from which it became separated after earthquakes and subsidence that occurred in ancient times. The remnants of these mountains include the islands of Kalymnos and Kappari which are separated by an underwater chasm about deep, as well as the volcano of Nisyros and the surrounding islands. There is a wide variety of rocks in Kos which is related to its geographical formation. Prominent among these are the Quaternary layers in which the fossil remains of mammals such as horses, hippopotami and elephants have been found. The fossilised molar of an elephant of gigantic proportions was presented to the Paleontology Museum of the University of Athens. Demographics =Turkish population= Gazi Hassan Pasha Mosque in Kos In the late 1920s about 3,700 Turks lived in Kos city, slightly less than 50% of the population, who settled mainly in the west part of the city. Today, the population of the Turkish community in Kos has been estimated at about 4,000 people. A village with significant Turkish population is Platani (Kermentes) near the town of Kos. =Religion= Cathedral of Kos The people of Kos are predominantly Orthodox Christians - one of the four Orthodox cathedrals in the Dodecanese is located in Kos. In addition, there is a Roman Catholic church on the island and a mosque for the Turkish-speaking Muslim community. The synagogue is no longer used for religious ceremonies as the Jewish community of Kos was targeted and destroyed by occupying German forces in World War II. It has, however, been restored and is maintained with all religious symbols intact and is now used by the Municipality of Kos for various events, mainly cultural. Main sights  =Castles= The Byzantine Antimachia Castle The island has a 14th-century fortress at the entrance to its harbour, erected in 1315 by the Knights Hospitaller, and another from the Byzantine period in Antimachia. =Ancient Agora= View of the municipal market, built in 1934‚Äì35 by architect Rodolfo Petracco The ancient market place of Kos was considered one of the biggest in the ancient world. It was the commercial and commanding centre at the heart of the ancient city. It was organized around a spacious rectangular yard wide and long. It began in the Northern area and ended up south on the central road (Decumanus) which went through the city. The northern side connected to the city wall towards the entrance to the harbour. Here there was a monumental entrance. On the eastern side there were shops. In the first half of the 2nd century BC, the building was extended toward the interior yard. The building was destroyed in an earthquake in 469 AD. In the southern end of the market, there was a round building with a Roman dome and a workshop which produced pigments including \\"Egyptian Blue\\". Coins, treasures, and copper statues from Roman times were later uncovered by archeologists. In the western side excavations led to the findings of rooms with mosaic floors which showed beastfights, a theme quite popular in Kos.Ancient Sites of the Harbour and Market Place . Kosinfo.gr. Culture The ancient physician Hippocrates is thought to have been born on Kos, and in the center of the town is the Plane Tree of Hippocrates, a dream temple where the physician is traditionally supposed to have taught. The limbs of the now elderly tree are supported by scaffolding. The small city is also home to the International Hippocratic Institute and the Hippocratic Museum dedicated to him. Near the Institute are the ruins of Asklepieion, where Herodicus taught Hippocrates medicine.

Ontologies are a formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects. Ontologies resemble class hierarchies in object-oriented programming but there are several critical differences. Class hierarchies are meant to represent structures used in source code that evolve fairly slowly (typically monthly revisions) whereas ontologies are meant to represent information on the Internet and are expected to be evolving almost constantly. Similarly, ontologies are typically far more flexible as they are meant to represent information on the Internet coming from all sorts of heterogeneous data sources. Class hierarchies on the other hand are meant to be fairly static and rely on far less diverse and more structured sources of data such as corporate databases. The OWL languages are characterized by formal semantics. They are built upon the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) XML standard for objects called the Resource Description Framework (RDF). OWL and RDF have attracted significant academic, medical and commercial interest. In October 2007, a new W3C working group was started to extend OWL with several new features as proposed in the OWL 1.1 member submission. W3C announced the new version of OWL on 27 October 2009. This new version, called OWL 2, soon found its way into semantic editors such as Prot√©g√© and semantic reasoners such as Pellet, RacerPro, FaCT++ and HermiT. The OWL family contains many species, serializations, syntaxes and specifications with similar names. OWL and OWL2 are used to refer to the 2004 and 2009 specifications, respectively. Full species names will be used, including specification version (for example, OWL2 EL). When referring more generally, OWL Family will be used. History =Early ontology languages= There is a long history of ontological development in philosophy and computer science. Since the 1990s, a number of research efforts have explored how the idea of knowledge representation (KR) from artificial intelligence (AI) could be made useful on the World Wide Web. These included languages based on HTML (called SHOE), based on XML (called XOL, later OIL), and various frame-based KR languages and knowledge acquisition approaches. Ontology languages for the web In 2000 in the United States, DARPA started development of DAML led by James Hendler. In March 2001, the Joint EU/US Committee on Agent Markup Languages decided that DAML should be merged with OIL. The EU/US ad hoc Joint Working Group on Agent Markup Languages was convened to develop DAML+OIL as a web ontology language. This group was jointly funded by the DARPA (under the DAML program) and the European Union's Information Society Technologies (IST) funding project. DAML+OIL was intended to be a thin layer above RDFS, with formal semantics based on a description logic (DL). DAML+OIL is a particularly major influence on OWL; OWL's design was specifically based on DAML+OIL. =Semantic web standards= RDF schema In the late 1990s, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Metadata Activity started work on RDF Schema (RDFS), a language for RDF vocabulary sharing. The RDF became a W3C Recommendation in February 1999, and RDFS a Candidate Recommendation in March 2000. In February 2001, the Semantic Web Activity replaced the Metadata Activity. In 2004 (as part of a wider revision of RDF) RDFS became a W3C Recommendation. Though RDFS provides some support for ontology specification, the need for a more expressive ontology language had become clear. Web-Ontology Working Group The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created the Web-Ontology Working Group as part of their Semantic Web Activity. It began work on November 1, 2001 with co-chairs James Hendler and Guus Schreiber. The first working drafts of the abstract syntax, reference and synopsis were published in July 2002. OWL became a formal W3C recommendation on February 10, 2004 and the working group was disbanded on May 31, 2004. OWL Working Group In 2005, at the OWL Experiences And Directions Workshop a consensus formed that recent advances in description logic would allow a more expressive revision to satisfy user requirements more comprehensively whilst retaining good computational properties. In December 2006, the OWL1.1 Member Submission was made to the W3C. The W3C chartered the OWL Working Group as part of the Semantic Web Activity in September 2007. In April 2008, this group decided to call this new language OWL2, indicating a substantial revision. OWL 2 became a W3C recommendation in October 2009. OWL 2 introduces profiles to improve scalability in typical applications. =Acronym= OWL was chosen as an easily pronounced acronym that would yield good logos, suggest wisdom, and honor William A. Martin's One World Language knowledge representation project from the 1970s. =Adoption= A 2006 survey of ontologies available on the web collected 688 OWL ontologies. Of these, 199 were OWL Lite, 149 were OWL DL and 337 OWL Full (by syntax). They found that 19 ontologies had in excess of 2,000 classes, and that 6 had more than 10,000. The same survey collected 587 RDFS vocabularies. Ontologies The data described by an ontology in the OWL family is interpreted as a set of \\"individuals\\" and a set of \\"property assertions\\" which relate these individuals to each other. An ontology consists of a set of axioms which place constraints on sets of individuals (called \\"classes\\") and the types of relationships permitted between them. These axioms provide semantics by allowing systems to infer additional information based on the data explicitly provided. A full introduction to the expressive power of the OWL is provided in the W3C's OWL Guide. OWL ontologies can import other ontologies, adding information from the imported ontology to the current ontology. =Example= An ontology describing families might include axioms stating that a \\"hasMother\\" property is only present between two individuals when \\"hasParent\\" is also present, and that individuals of class \\"HasTypeOBlood\\" are never related via \\"hasParent\\" to members of the \\"HasTypeABBlood\\" class. If it is stated that the individual Harriet is related via \\"hasMother\\" to the individual Sue, and that Harriet is a member of the \\"HasTypeOBlood\\" class, then it can be inferred that Sue is not a member of \\"HasTypeABBlood\\". This is, however, only true if the concepts of \\"Parent\\" and \\"Mother\\" only mean biological parent or mother and not social parent or mother. Species =OWL sublanguages= The W3C-endorsed OWL specification includes the definition of three variants of OWL, with different levels of expressiveness. These are OWL Lite, OWL DL and OWL Full (ordered by increasing expressiveness). Each of these sublanguages is a syntactic extension of its simpler predecessor. The following set of relations hold. Their inverses do not. * Every legal OWL Lite ontology is a legal OWL DL ontology. * Every legal OWL DL ontology is a legal OWL Full ontology. * Every valid OWL Lite conclusion is a valid OWL DL conclusion. * Every valid OWL DL conclusion is a valid OWL Full conclusion. OWL Lite OWL Lite was originally intended to support those users primarily needing a classification hierarchy and simple constraints. For example, while it supports cardinality constraints, it only permits cardinality values of 0 or 1. It was hoped that it would be simpler to provide tool support for OWL Lite than its more expressive relatives, allowing quick migration path for systems using thesauri and other taxonomies. In practice, however, most of the expressiveness constraints placed on OWL Lite amount to little more than syntactic inconveniences: most of the constructs available in OWL DL can be built using complex combinations of OWL Lite features, and is equally expressive as the description logic \\\\mathcal{SHIF}(\\\\mathbf{D}). Development of OWL Lite tools has thus proven to be almost as difficult as development of tools for OWL DL, and OWL Lite is not widely used. OWL DL OWL DL is designed to provide the maximum expressiveness possible while retaining computational completeness (either œÜ or ¬¨œÜ holds), decidability (there is an effective procedure to determine whether œÜ is derivable or not), and the availability of practical reasoning algorithms. OWL DL includes all OWL language constructs, but they can be used only under certain restrictions (for example, number restrictions may not be placed upon properties which are declared to be transitive; and while a class may be a subclass of many classes, a class cannot be an instance of another class). OWL DL is so named due to its correspondence with description logic, a field of research that has studied the logics that form the formal foundation of OWL. OWL Full OWL Full is based on a different semantics from OWL Lite or OWL DL, and was designed to preserve some compatibility with RDF Schema. For example, in OWL Full a class can be treated simultaneously as a collection of individuals and as an individual in its own right; this is not permitted in OWL DL. OWL Full allows an ontology to augment the meaning of the pre-defined (RDF or OWL) vocabulary. OWL Full is undecidable, so no reasoning software is able to perform complete reasoning for it. =OWL2 profiles= In OWL 2, there are three sublanguages of the language. OWL 2 EL is a fragment that has polynomial time reasoning complexity; OWL 2 QL is designed to enable easier access and query to data stored in databases; OWL 2 RL is a rule subset of OWL 2. Syntax The OWL family of languages supports a variety of syntaxes. It is useful to distinguish high level syntaxes aimed at specification from exchange syntaxes more suitable for general use. =High level= These are close to the ontology structure of languages in the OWL family. OWL abstract syntax High level syntax is used to specify the OWL ontology structure and semantics. The OWL abstract syntax presents an ontology as a sequence of annotations, axioms and facts. Annotations carry machine and human oriented meta-data. Information about the classes, properties and individuals that compose the ontology is contained in axioms and facts only. Each class, property and individual is either anonymous or identified by an URI reference. Facts state data either about an individual or about a pair of individual identifiers (that the objects identified are distinct or the same). Axioms specify the characteristics of classes and properties. This style is similar to frame languages, and quite dissimilar to well known syntaxes for DLs and Resource Description Framework (RDF). Sean Bechhofer, et al. argue that though this syntax is hard to parse, it is quite concrete. They conclude that the name abstract syntax may be somewhat misleading. OWL2 functional syntax This syntax closely follows the structure of an OWL2 ontology. It is used by OWL2 to specify semantics, mappings to exchange syntaxes and profiles. =Exchange syntaxes= RDF syntaxes Syntactic mappings into RDF are specified for languages in the OWL family. Several RDF serialization formats have been devised. Each leads to a syntax for languages in the OWL family through this mapping. RDF/XML is normative. OWL2 XML syntax OWL2 specifies an XML serialization that closely models the structure of an OWL2 ontology. Manchester Syntax The Manchester Syntax is a compact, human readable syntax with a style close to frame languages. Variations are available for OWL and OWL2. Not all OWL and OWL2 ontologies can be expressed in this syntax. =Examples= * The W3C OWL 2 Web Ontology Language provides syntax examples. Tea ontology Consider an ontology for tea based on a Tea class. First, an ontology identifier is needed. Every OWL ontology must be identified by a URI (http://www.example.org/tea.owl, say). This example provides a sense of the syntax. To save space below, preambles and prefix definitions have been skipped. ;OWL2 Functional Syntax: Ontology( Declaration( Class( :Tea ) ) ) ;OWL2 XML Syntax: ;Manchester Syntax: Ontology: Class: Tea ;RDF/XML syntax: ;RDF/Turtle: rdf:type owl:Ontology . :Tea rdf:type owl:Class . Semantics =Relation to description logics= OWL classes correspond to description logic (DL) concepts, OWL properties to DL roles, while individuals are called the same way in both the OWL and the DL terminology. Early attempts to build large ontologies were plagued by a lack of clear definitions. Members of the OWL family have model theoretic formal semantics, and so have strong logical foundations. Description logics are a family of logics that are decidable fragments of first-order logic with attractive and well-understood computational properties. OWL DL and OWL Lite semantics are based on DLs. They combine a syntax for describing and exchanging ontologies, and formal semantics that gives them meaning. For example, OWL DL corresponds to the \\\\mathcal{SHOIN}^\\\\mathcal{(D)} description logic, while OWL 2 corresponds to the \\\\mathcal{SROIQ}^\\\\mathcal{(D)} logic. Sound, complete, terminating reasoners (i.e. systems which are guaranteed to derive every consequence of the knowledge in an ontology) exist for these DLs. =Relation to RDFS= OWL Full is intended to be compatible with RDF Schema (RDFS), and to be capable of augmenting the meanings of existing Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabulary. A model theory describes the formal semantics for RDF. This interpretation provides the meaning of RDF and RDFS vocabulary. So, the meaning of OWL Full ontologies are defined by extension of the RDFS meaning, and OWL Full is a semantic extension of RDF. =Open world assumption= The languages in the OWL family use the open world assumption. Under the open world assumption, if a statement cannot be proven to be true with current knowledge, we cannot draw the conclusion that the statement is false. Contrast to other languages A relational database consists of sets of tuples with the same attributes. SQL is a query and management language for relational databases. Prolog is a logical programming language. Both use the closed world assumption. Terminology Languages in the OWL family are capable of creating classes, properties, defining instances and its operations. =Instances= An instance is an object. It corresponds to a description logic individual. =Classes= A class is a collection of objects. A class may contain individuals, instances of the class. A class may have any number of instances. An instance may belong to none, one or more classes. A class may be a subclass of another, inheriting characteristics from its parent superclass. This corresponds to logical subsumption and DL concept inclusion notated \\\\sqsubseteq. All classes are subclasses of owl:Thing (DL top notated \\\\top), the root class. All classes are subclassed by owl:Nothing (DL bottom notated \\\\bot), the empty class. No instances are members of owl:Nothing. Modelers use owl:Thing and owl:Nothing to assert facts about all or no instances. Class and their members can be defined in OWL either by extension or by intension. An individual can be explicitly assigned a class by a Class assertion, for example we can add a statement Queen elizabeth is a(n instance of) human, or by a class expression with ClassExpression statements every instance of the human class who has a female value to the sex property is an instance of the woman class. Example Let's call human the class of all humans in the world is a subclass of owl:thing. The class of all women (say woman) in the world is a subclass of human. Then we have \\\\textsf{owl:Nothing} \\\\sqsubseteq \\\\textsf{woman} \\\\sqsubseteq \\\\textsf{human} \\\\sqsubseteq \\\\textsf{owl:Thing} The membership of some individual to a class could be noted ClassAssertion( human George_Washington ) and class inclusion SubClassOf( woman human ) The first means \\"George Washington is a human\\" and the second \\"every woman is human\\". =Properties= A property is a characteristic of a class - a directed binary relation that specifies some attribute which is true for instances of that class. Properties sometimes act as data values, or links to other instances. Properties may exhibit logical features, for example, by being transitive, symmetric, inverse and functional. Properties may also have domains and ranges. Datatype properties Datatype properties are relations between instances of classes and RDF literals or XML schema datatypes. For example, modelName (String datatype) is the property of Manufacturer class. They are formulated using owl:DatatypeProperty type. Object properties Object properties are relations between instances of two classes. For example, ownedBy may be an object type property of the Vehicle class and may have a range which is the class Person. They are formulated using owl:ObjectProperty. =Operators= Languages in the OWL family support various operations on classes such as union, intersection and complement. They also allow class enumeration, cardinality, disjointness, and equivalence. =Metaclasses= Metaclasses are classes of classes. They are allowed in OWL full or with a feature called class/instance punning. Public ontologies =Libraries= Biomedical * OBO Foundry * NCBO BioPortal * NCI Enterprise Vocabulary Services =Standards= * Suggested Upper Merged Ontology * TDWG * PROV-O, the ontology version of the W3C's PROV-DM * Basic Formal Ontology * European Materials Modelling Ontology EMMO =Browsers= The following tools include public ontology browsers: * Prot√©g√© OWL =Search= * Swoogle Limitations * No direct language support for n-ary relationships. For example, modelers may wish to describe the qualities of a relation, to relate more than 2 individuals or to relate an individual to a list. This cannot be done within OWL. They may need to adopt a pattern instead which encodes the meaning outside the formal semantics.

The train crew decided to divide the train and take forward the front portion, leaving the rear portion on the running line. The rear portion was inadequately braked and ran back down the gradient, colliding with a following train. Eighty people were killed and 260 injured, about a third of them children. It was the worst rail disaster in the UK in the nineteenth century, and remains Ireland's worst railway disaster ever. To this day, it is the fourth worst railway accident in the United Kingdom. At the time it was the worst rail disaster in Europe and led directly to various safety measures becoming legal requirements for railways in the United Kingdom. This was important both for the measures introduced and for the move away from voluntarism and towards more direct state intervention in such matters. Circumstances of the accident Map of the railway between Armagh and Hamiltons Bawn =The excursion sets out= Armagh Sunday school had organised a day trip to the seaside resort of Warrenpoint, a distance of about . A special Great Northern Railway of Ireland train was arranged for the journey, intended to carry about eight hundred passengers. The railway route was steeply graded and curved, and the first from Armagh Station involved a steep continuous climb, up a gradient of 1 in 82 (1.22%) and then 1 in 75 (1.33%). Elsewhere on the line, there were gradients as severe as 1 in 70.2 (1.42%).Report of the Board of Trade (Railway Department) into the circumstances of the collision near Armagh on 12th June 1889, Maj-Gen C S Hutchinson Asked to provide rolling stock for a special train to take 800 excursionists, the locomotive department at Dundalk sent fifteen vehicles hauled by a 'four-coupled'the familiar Whyte notation was not yet in use (first used in 1900) (2-4-0) locomotive;http://www.steamindex.com/locotype/gnri.htm gives a catalogue raison√©e of the various engines of the Great Northern Railway of Ireland. From the details given in the accident report, the excursion train engine appears to have been one of the GNR(I)'s H class however the instructions to the engine driver were that the train was to be of thirteen vehicles. There were more intending passengers than anticipated and, to accommodate the excursion, the Armagh station master decided to use all fifteen vehicles. The engine driver, who had never driven the route before (but had been over it with excursion trains when a fireman), objected to these instructions, saying that his instructions were that the train was to be of thirteen vehicles at most. According to the driver Two other witnesses said that the driver had asked for a second engine if more carriages were added and had been refused by the station master, as none were available; the driver (in supplementary evidence given \\"through the railway company's officers\\") denied this. The station master's evidenceAccident report ‚Äì evidence of John Foster (the station master) was that the discussion was about adding further carriages to the 15 with which the locomotive had arrived. It is not clear that all witnesses agreed as to whether brake-vans counted as carriages or vehicles, the string with which the locomotive arrived is variously described as fifteen vehicles, fifteen carriages, and thirteen vehicles and two brake vans The general manager's chief clerk was to accompany the excursion; he suggested that the engine of the routine train that would be following twenty minutes behind could assist the excursion up the bank (or that some carriages could be left to come on with the routine train). Following his conversation with the station master, however, the driver refused the assistance.Accident report ‚Äì evidence of James Elliott (examined in prison) The train therefore set off with fifteen carriages, containing about 940 passengers.The 1881 Census for Ireland reports the population of the parliamentary borough of Armagh to have been under 9,000. The organisers of the excursion subsequently were sent a bill for ¬£39 4s 3d for 941 excursion tickets to Warrenpoint (Birmingham Daily Post Monday 1 July 1889), for which the railway company later apologised The carriages were full, and some passengers travelled with the guards. Tickets were checked before setting off and to prevent people without tickets joining the excursion, once each compartment had been checked its doors were locked.This was described as standard practice for excursions, however it was contrary to Board of Trade recommendations made after a railway fire at Versailles in 1842 (that one door to a compartment should not be locked) and after the Abergele rail disaster in 1868 (that all doors should be unlocked) Initially, the train made progress up the steep gradient at about but stalled about before the top of the gradient.Accident report ‚Äì evidence of Thomas McGrath =Dividing the excursion train= To prevent the train rolling back, the brakes were applied. The train did have continuous brakes, (i.e., all carriages had brakes which could be operated by the driver), but they were of the non-automatic vacuum type. They were applied by creation of vacuum in the brake pipes and released by admitting air to the pipe. This was the opposite of the arrangement preferred by the Board of Trade ('automatic continuous brakes') in which brakes were held off by vacuum (or compressed air) generated by the engine, so that on loss of vacuum (e.g. from a leaky connection or a connection parting) the brakes came on automatically. The two brake vans, however, (one immediately behind the engine tender, the other at the rear of the train) also had hand-operated brakes, each under the control of a guard. These were applied.according to the guards The chief clerk directed the train crew to divide the train and proceed with the front portion to Hamilton's Bawn station, about away, and leave that portion there, and return for the second portion. Owing to limited siding capacity at Hamilton's Bawn, only the front five vehicles could be taken on there; so the rearmost ten vehicles would have to be left standing on the running line. Once this rear portion was uncoupled from the front portion, the continuous brakes on it would be released, and the only brakes holding it against the gradient would be the hand-operated brakes in the rear brake van. For a goods (freight) train in a similar situation, the wheels would have been 'scotched'wedged or chocked, see wikt:scotch#Verb 4 against roll-back, and guard's vans on goods trains carried 'sprags'pieces of wood to place in between wheel spokes in order to prevent rotation, see wikt:sprag#Verb 1 with which to do this. Those on passenger trains with continuous brakes were not required to carry sprags, and the excursion train did not. The guard in the rear van having applied his handbrake then (on the instructions of the chief clerk) dismounted and scotched the wheels of his van with pieces of ballast. He then also scotched the near rearmost vehicle on its righthand wheels and intended to similarly scotch its lefthand wheels before going back down the track with flags and detonators to protect the train from the scheduled service which was to set off from Armagh 20 minutes after the excursion. The train was screw-coupled; each carriage was first coupled by a loose chain and hook coupling to the next; the slack on this was then taken up by a turnbuckle screw arrangement, until the buffers of the two carriages were touching. To uncouple, there needed to be some slack in the coupling; as the train had stopped all the couplings were under tension. Once the vacuum brake connection to the rear portion was broken, any attempt to introduce slack into the coupling between the two portions would be defeated by the rear portion settling back to rest its weight upon the rear van brakes. To assist uncoupling the front van guard therefore scotched one of the wheels of the sixth vehicle, that is, the front vehicle of the rear portion being detached. Loosening the turnbuckle thus transferred the weight of the rear portion to the scotch on the sixth vehicle, rather than to the rear van brakes. The couplings to the rear of the sixth vehicle remained under tension, and the slack introduced remained in the coupling between the fifth and sixth vehicles, which could be unhooked. = The rear carriages run away = The uncoupling accomplished by the front van guard, the driver attempted to start the front portion away. It rolled back slightly, in the opinion of the front guard ‚Äì Accident return ‚Äì evidence of William Moorehead jolting the rear portion; which caused the wheels of the front vehicle of the rear portion to ride up over the stones underneath them. The rear portion had been standing with its couplings tight, but now only the rear two vehicles were in any way restrained, so that the leading eight vehicles of the rear portion fell back on to them. The momentum of the eight vehicles closing on the rear two was sufficient to push them over the stones, crushing them in turn, so that now only the handbrake on the rear brake van was effective. It was overcome by the weight of ten vehicles, and the rear portion began to move downhill and gathered speed down the steep gradient back towards Armagh Station. > \\"..as I was putting down the last stone, I felt the carriages coming back. I > went on the van, and got in, and tried, with the assistance of two > passengers, to get an extra turn at the brake handle, 'and was still doing > this when Mr. Elliott \\" (the chief clerk) \\"jumped up on the left step, and > said Try and make the best you can without breaking it (meaning the brake > handle), and I said I could make no more.

The speed then gradually increased, until it > became so fast that we could not see the hedges as we passed.\\"Accident > return ‚Äì evidence of Thomas Henry The train crew reversed the front portion and tried to catch the rear portion and re-couple it, but this proved to be impossible. =Collision= Contemporary photograph of the aftermath of the runaway Board of Trade plan of accident site The line was operated on the time interval system (rather than block working) so that there was no means at Armagh of knowing that the line was not clear. The required 20-minute interval before letting a fast train follow a slow one having elapsed, the following scheduled passenger train had left Armagh. With an engine of similar performance, but a much lighter train (six vehicles), it was managing about up the gradient when, at a distance of about , the driver of the ordinary train saw the approaching runaway vehicle. He braked his train, and had reduced speed to at the moment of collision. By now, the runaways had travelled about . The pursuing driver said he did not believe they had reached more than ; the Board of Trade inspector thought a fair estimate of their speed at the collision. 1¬Ω miles at 1 in 75 is a vertical drop of about and even without any friction or wind resistance, a simple conservation of energy calculation will show that the runaway coaches could not have reached more than about 56 mph (If this seems too much like original research, note instead that the fall is slightly more than the vertical drop in Box Tunnel; Rolt op cit reports Brunel to have rebutted Dionysius Lardner's prediction of for a train going down the tunnel without brakes by showing the correct answer to be ) The engine of the scheduled train overturned, and the connection to its tender was lost. This train was also fitted with 'simple' (non-automatic) continuous vacuum brakes, and these were lost when the engine became disconnected. The train split into two sections, both running back down the gradient towards Armagh. Application of the handbrakes on the tender and on the brake van brought the front and rear halves of the scheduled train to a stop without further incident, a witness telling the inspector \\"The tender was slightly damaged, but none of the vehicles, and I heard from the guard that a horse in the box next the tender was not injured\\". The occupants of the rear of the excursion train were not so lucky. The two rearmost vehicles of the excursion train were utterly destroyed, and the third rearmost very badly damaged.Accident return ‚Äì evidence of James Park The debris tumbled down a embankment. Causes of the runaway =Inadequate application of brakes = As part of his investigations, the Board of Trade inspector carried out calculations which established that a train similar to the excursion train could be hauled over the Armagh bank at about by the excursion train engine, and supported this by a practical trial;. However, he did criticise the allocation of an engine with only just enough power for such a duty, especially with a driver who had little knowledge of the route. A further practical trial showed that a single brake van, with the brake correctly working and correctly applied, could (without the aid of scotching) hold 10 carriages on the Armagh bank, against both their own weight and a nudge similar to that which witnesses agreed in describing as having been caused by run-back of the front portion of the divided train. Hence, the problem was not the inadequacy of the brake. > The immediate cause was the want of the application of sufficient brake > power to hold the rear portion of the excursion train, when this portion, > consisting of nine coaches and a brake van; which had been separated from > the front of the train by direction of Mr. Elliott, was slightly bumped by > the front portion of the train when the driver had to set back previously to > starting for Hamilton's Bawn. Two witnesses had seen the brake working properly before the train left Armagh, and the brake apparatus had been found in the wreckage and appeared to be in good working order. Nonetheless, the rear portion had run away, and had done so with the braked wheels revolving freely.Accident report ‚Äì evidence of James Elliott Therefore, either the brake had not been applied properly by the guard, or it had been tampered with by passengers in the brake carriage. In the circumstances, the guard should be given the benefit of the doubt. =Incorrect response to the excursion train stalling= Responsibility lay primarily with Mr Elliott, the chief clerk. He had directed a course of action which ignored Company rules. These laid down that the main guard should not leave his van until perfectly satisfied that his brake would hold the train (the train should therefore have been allowed to ease back upon the rear brake van); once he had left his brake, no attempt should be made to move the train until he was back at the brake. Meanwhile, the more junior guard should have gone back down the track to protect the train. These precautions had been omitted, to pursue a strategy (dividing the train) which, even had nothing gone wrong, would have had no advantages over awaiting the scheduled train to assist the excursion to Hamilton's Bawn. > If Mr. Elliott had therefore only had the prudence to wait where the > excursion train stopped near the top of the bank and to send back one of the > guards to protect his train, with instructions to ask the driver of the > following ordinary train to help the excursion train up the short remaining > distance, he would hardly have lost time and would, besides, have avoided > the risk inseparable from the delicate operation he unwisely determined to > carry out and which should have been resorted to under only most exceptional > circumstances and not, as in the present case, where there was so easy a > solution of the difficulty. Other criticisms = Wrong driver, wrong engine = The excursion train (even in the 15-vehicle form in which it set off) should have been able to climb Armagh bank at about . The inspector considered that its failure to do so must have been due to some want of proper management of the engine by its insufficiently experienced driver. The locomotive shed foreman at Dundalk was criticised for want of judgement in not sending a more experienced driverHe made the interesting suggestion in his evidence that there had been no problem with the engine but the brakes had been tampered with. No reason was given in the accident return for discounting the possibility that the train had been held back by wrongly applied brakes. The Oxford Companion to British Railway History op cit notes ‚Äì in its article on brakes (p 39) ‚Äì of the simple vacuum system. > The erratic performance of early ejectors caused substantial fluctuations in > vacuum while the brakes were off. This led to brake blocks rubbing on the > wheels, not hard enough to stop the train, but wasting fuel‚Ä¶ It might also be noted that, when the various continuous braking systems had been trialled at Newark in 1875 on one run, the train with vacuum brakes 'failed to attain sufficient speed due to imperfect release of the brake blocks' and in his choice of engine. The 2-4-0 supplied would have had insufficient margins (even when hauling a 13-vehicle excursion train) to be sure of maintaining a safe speedThe line was run on the time interval system and it was therefore dangerous to go much slower than the train behind over the more onerous gradients farther up the line. For a 15-vehicle excursion, assistance should have been given by the engine of the regular train. = Failure to provide an assisting engine = The report criticised the over- confidence of the excursion engine driver as to the capabilities of his engine and regretted that his better judgement must have been overcome by the words of the Armagh station master. The chief clerk came in for further criticism for not having persisted with his instructions for the regular train engine to provide assistance. There was no direct criticism of the station master; either for having increased the size of the train, or for persuading the engine driver to attempt Armagh bank without assistance. = The excursion train = The organisation of this was criticised on a number of points: *Passengers should not have been allowed to travel in the brake vans, a practice that should be sternly prohibited *Carriage doors should not have been locked: a wrong thing *Given the weight of the train and the gradients on the line, both brake vans should have been at the rear of the train *It should not have been so big > The running of such heavily laden excursion trains as the present on lines > with bad gradients, is a practice much to be deprecated; it would be far > better to limit them to about 10 vehicles.

In the present instance, > the train, owing to its length, had to be loaded on the main line partly at > the up platform and partly at the down platform, and afterwards by a series > of shunts to be moved on to the Newry and Armagh Line.  Findings of the inquest  The inquest was completed on Friday 21 June 1889, and made findings of culpable negligence against six of those involved; those at Dundalk responsible for selection of the engine, the driver and both guards on the train, and Mr Elliott who had taken charge. As a result, three of the accused were committed for trial for manslaughter on the following Monday (One guard had been injured in the crash and was presumably still in hospital; the Dundalk personnel were not charged, the 'practical trial' showing that the engine supplied should not have been defeated by Armagh bank if correctly handled having been carried out on Saturday 22 June). The jury are not reported to have made any findings against more senior management of the Great Northern Railway of Ireland. Elliott was tried in Dublin in August, when the jury reported they were unable to agree; on re-trial in October he was acquitted. The cases against the other defendants were then dropped.  Recommendation and consequent legislation  = Recommendation triggering legislation= The key recommendation was in fact couched as a finding: > This terrible calamity would in all human probability have been prevented > had the excursion train been fitted with an automatic continuous brake > instead of (as it was) with only a non-automatic continuous brake. In the > former case, on the dividing of the train taking place, the brake would have > remained on, or (had it been previously taken off) would have been at once > applied to, the rear vehicles, and these would have remained immovable, > notwithstanding any possible bump they might have received from the front of > the train, when the driver was setting back to make a start.

The Board of Trade had got as far and as fast as it could by persuasion, but an inspector commented in 1880 after the Wennington Junction rail crash > It is all very well for the Midland Railway Company now to plead that they > are busily employed in fitting up their passenger trains with continuous > breaks, but the necessity for providing the passenger trains with a larger > proportion of break power was pointed out by the Board of Trade to all > Railway Companies more than 20 years since; and with the exception of a very > few railway companies that recognised that necessity and acted upon it, it > may be truly stated that the principal Railway Companies throughout the > Kingdom have resisted the efforts of the Board of Trade to cause them to do > what was right, which the latter had no legal power to enforce, and even now > it will be seen by the latest returns laid before Parliament that some of > those Companies are still doing nothing to supply this now generally > acknowledged necessity =Questions in Parliament= In the aftermath of the accident, questions to the President of the Board of Trade Sir Michael Hicks Beach revealed that * in the whole of Ireland only one engine and six vehicles were equipped with an automatic continuous brake * in England 18% of the passenger rolling stock had no continuous brake, and a further 22% had non-automatic brakes * in Scotland 40% of the passenger rolling stock were without continuous brakesreply to Francis Channing, House of Commons Debates 18 June 1889 vol 337 cc118-9 More specifically, for the Great Northern of Ireland *in March 1888 there were 208 drivers and firemen employed and 693 occasions on which they worked a 14-hour day or longer, including two in which they worked over 18 hoursHouse of Commons Debates 21 June 1889 vol 337 cc422-3.The questioner (the MP for West Belfast) also alleged > the two men who acted as guards on the excursion train that met with the > fatal disaster were untried men, shunters at Newry Station, and had no > knowledge of the line or of the duties of a guard, and that one of them, > Moorhead, had been on duty 16 hours the previous day, and also from four > o'clock that morning, and that his wages were 11s. per week which somewhat overstated the case; they had served as guards from time to time in the past . * of the 518 miles of railway it worked, only 23 were worked on the block system[answer to T W Russell, House of Commons Debates 15 July 1889 vol338 c392 * It had no engines or vehicles whose brakes met the requirements of the Board of Trade, furthermore: > MR.

HICKS BEACH The facts are as stated in the questionHouse of Commons > Debates 11 July 1889 vol 338 cc116-7 116 =New legislation= The government was already short of Parliamentary time in which to pass legislation it was already committed to, and had promised to introduce no further controversial measures. A bill was drafted and introduced, only to be withdrawn when it became clear that some of its other provisions (most notably requiring specified improvements in couplings, so that those engaged in shunting could safely uncouple wagons without having to step into the gap between them) were sufficiently contentious as to jeopardise passage of the non-controversial portions of the Bill. For that reason, some Liberal MPs sympathetic to railwaymen's concerns on working hours and the hazards of shunting amongst them noticeably the MP for Crewe expressed disappointment that the Bill did not go far enough. On the other hand, during the Second Reading a Liberal MP made the classic argument against detailed and prescriptive regulation > It would be a very serious thing if the Government in its attempt to protect > the lives of passengers by rail, and the lives of working men, should take > on itself to decide what form of carriage, what form of coupling and break, > is the proper form for railway companies to use.

Precisely, it is a topological space equipped with a sheaf of rings called a structure sheaf. It is an abstraction of the concept of the rings of continuous (scalar-valued) functions on open subsets. Among ringed spaces, especially important and prominent is a locally ringed space: a ringed space in which the analogy of a germ of a function is valid. Ringed spaces appear in analysis as well as complex algebraic geometry and scheme theory of algebraic geometry. Note: In the definition of a ringed space, most expositions tend to restrict the rings to be commutative rings, including Hartshorne and Wikipedia. \\"√âl√©ments de g√©om√©trie alg√©brique\\", on the other hand, does not impose the commutativity assumption, although the book mostly considers the commutative case.EGA, Ch 0, 4.1.1. Definitions A ringed space (X, OX) is a topological space X together with a sheaf of rings OX on X. The sheaf OX is called the structure sheaf of X. A locally ringed space is a ringed space (X, OX) such that all stalks of OX are local rings (i.e. they have unique maximal ideals). Note that it is not required that OX(U) be a local ring for every open set U; in fact, this is almost never the case. Examples An arbitrary topological space X can be considered a locally ringed space by taking OX to be the sheaf of real-valued (or complex-valued) continuous functions on open subsets of X (there may exist continuous functions over open subsets of X that are not the restriction of any continuous function over X). The stalk at a point x can be thought of as the set of all germs of continuous functions at x; this is a local ring with maximal ideal consisting of those germs whose value at x is 0. If X is a manifold with some extra structure, we can also take the sheaf of differentiable, or complex-analytic functions. Both of these give rise to locally ringed spaces. If X is an algebraic variety carrying the Zariski topology, we can define a locally ringed space by taking OX(U) to be the ring of rational mappings defined on the Zariski-open set U that do not blow up (become infinite) within U. The important generalization of this example is that of the spectrum of any commutative ring; these spectra are also locally ringed spaces. Schemes are locally ringed spaces obtained by \\"gluing together\\" spectra of commutative rings. Morphisms A morphism from (X, OX) to (Y, OY) is a pair , where is a continuous map between the underlying topological spaces, and is a morphism from the structure sheaf of to the direct image of the structure sheaf of . In other words, a morphism from (X, OX) to (Y, OY) is given by the following data: * a continuous map f : X ‚Üí Y * a family of ring homomorphisms œÜV : OY(V) ‚Üí OX(f -1(V)) for every open set V of Y which commute with the restriction maps. That is, if V1 ‚äÇ V2 are two open subsets of Y, then the following diagram must commute (the vertical maps are the restriction homomorphisms): center There is an additional requirement for morphisms between locally ringed spaces: *the ring homomorphisms induced by œÜ between the stalks of Y and the stalks of X must be local homomorphisms, i.e. for every x ‚àà X the maximal ideal of the local ring (stalk) at f(x) ‚àà Y is mapped to the maximal ideal of the local ring at x ‚àà X. Two morphisms can be composed to form a new morphism, and we obtain the category of ringed spaces and the category of locally ringed spaces. Isomorphisms in these categories are defined as usual. Tangent spaces Locally ringed spaces have just enough structure to allow the meaningful definition of tangent spaces. Let X be locally ringed space with structure sheaf OX; we want to define the tangent space Tx at the point x ‚àà X. Take the local ring (stalk) Rx at the point x, with maximal ideal mx. Then kx := Rx/mx is a field and mx/mx2 is a vector space over that field (the cotangent space). The tangent space Tx is defined as the dual of this vector space. The idea is the following: a tangent vector at x should tell you how to \\"differentiate\\" \\"functions\\" at x, i.e. the elements of Rx. Now it is enough to know how to differentiate functions whose value at x is zero, since all other functions differ from these only by a constant, and we know how to differentiate constants. So we only need to consider mx. Furthermore, if two functions are given with value zero at x, then their product has derivative 0 at x, by the product rule. So we only need to know how to assign \\"numbers\\" to the elements of mx/mx2, and this is what the dual space does. OX modules Given a locally ringed space (X, OX), certain sheaves of modules on X occur in the applications, the OX-modules. To define them, consider a sheaf F of abelian groups on X. If F(U) is a module over the ring OX(U) for every open set U in X, and the restriction maps are compatible with the module structure, then we call F an OX-module. In this case, the stalk of F at x will be a module over the local ring (stalk) Rx, for every x‚ààX. A morphism between two such OX-modules is a morphism of sheaves which is compatible with the given module structures. The category of OX- modules over a fixed locally ringed space (X, OX) is an abelian category. An important subcategory of the category of OX-modules is the category of quasi- coherent sheaves on X. A sheaf of OX-modules is called quasi-coherent if it is, locally, isomorphic to the cokernel of a map between free OX-modules. A coherent sheaf F is a quasi-coherent sheaf which is, locally, of finite type and for every open subset U of X the kernel of any morphism from a free OU- modules of finite rank to FU is also of finite type.

The name is believed to be derived from the Old English √¶√æeling meaning \\"prince\\" + -ney meaning \\"isle\\". The village is best known for once being the fortress hiding place of King Alfred the Great, from where he went on to defeat the Great Heathen Army at the Battle of Edington in May 878. King Alfred's Monument Isle of Athelney The area is known as the Isle of Athelney, because it was once a very low isolated island in the 'very great swampy and impassable marshes' of the Somerset Levels. Much of the Levels are below the level of high tide. They are now drained for agricultural use during the summer, but are regularly flooded in the winter. Archaeological excavations and written evidence indicate that at the time of Alfred the island was linked by a causeway, known as Balt Moor Wall, to East Lyng, with either end protected by a semi-circular stockade and ditch, the ditch on the island is now known to date from the Iron Age. It is therefore presumed that the Isle was known by Alfred to have been an ancient fort, and that its existing defences were strengthened by him. Evidence of metalworking on the site suggests that he also used the island to equip his army. When translated from the Anglo-Saxon, the name of the isle, √Üthelinga √≠eg, is often thought to mean the Island of Princes; if correct this might suggest that the island had royal connections prior to Alfred. To give thanks for his victory, Alfred founded a monastery, Athelney Abbey, on the Isle in 888, which lasted until the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII in 1539, when the value of the rubble was put at ¬£80. After Athelney Abbey was dissolved, the monks built the church in the neighbouring village of East Lyng. There are no remains of the monastery above ground, but investigations were carried out in the first episode of television archaeology programme Time Team in 1993. A decade later, in the one-hundredth episode, excavations were carried out. These revealed it as one of the only known Anglo-Saxon metalworking sites in the UK. The monastery's location was shown by a small monument on top of the isle in 1801 built by Sir John Slade, 1st Baronet of the Slade Baronets, on the site of a stone vault. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument (Somerset County No 367) and Grade II listed building. The monument is now on private land belonging to Athelney Farm and is accessible via a permissive path past the farm. Athelney is around from North Petherton, where the Alfred Jewel (an Anglo-Saxon ornament dating from the late 9th century) was discovered in 1693.

The museum serves as both an educational facility on Canadian military history, in addition to serving as a place of remembrance. The museum building is situated south of the Ottawa River in LeBreton Flats. The museum houses a number of exhibitions and memorials, in addition to a theatre, curatorial and conservation spaces, storage space, and a cafeteria. The building also houses the Military History Research Centre, the museum's library and archives. The Canadian War Museum was formally established in 1942, although portions of the museum's collections originates from a military museum that operated from 1880 to 1896. The museum was operated by the Public Archives of Canada until 1967, when the National Museums of Canada Corporation was formed to manage several national institutions, including the war museum. In the same year, the war museum was relocated from its original building to the former Public Archives of Canada building. Management of the museum was later assumed by the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation (later renamed the Canadian Museum of History Corporation) in 1990. Plans to expand the museum during the mid-1990s resulted in the construction of a new building at LeBreton Flats. Designed by Moriyama & Teshima Architects and Griffiths Rankin Cook Architects, the new Canadian War Museum building was opened to the public in 2005. The museum's collection contains over 500,000 pieces of materials related to military history, including over 13,000 pieces of military art. In addition to its permanent exhibition, the museum has hosted and organized a number of travelling exhibitions relating to Canadian military history. Background Cartier Square Drill Hall housed the Cartier Square Military Museum from 1880 to 1896. The military museum served as the predecessor to the Canadian War Museum The collections of the Canadian War Museum originated from the collections of the Cartier Square Military Museum, established through a general order on 5 November 1880. Established with the intention to be museum of national interest, the institution sought to preserve historical records and materials relating to the Canadian Militia, and any of its colonial predecessors. A proposal to establish a library operated by the museum was made in 1882, although these plans never came to fruition. As the museum continued to solicit donations for its collection the museum quickly outgrew its space in the drill hall, and appeals for a new facility were made by 1886. The museum was eventually closed in 1896, with militia units that used the drill hall requiring more space, and to make room to accommodate a new shipments of Lee- Enfield rifles. The militia office originally planned to relocate the museum, storing its collections in an old military warehouse below Parliament Hill (present location of the Bytown Museum). In July 1901, the Department of Militia and Defence negotiated a lease to house the museum in another building in Ottawa. However, little effort was put into re-establishing the museum, with the department opting to not renew the building's lease in 1905. On 26 January 1907, the Militia Council was informed by Eug√®ne Fiset, the Quartermaster-General of the Canadian Militia, that there was \\"no interest being taken by the officers of the garrison\\" for a museum, and that he did not recommend reopening one. The collection from the Cartier Square Military Museum remained at the warehouse until Dominion Archivist, Arthur Doughty, requested the transference of the items to the archives for the purposes of displaying some of them. The militia approved the request, and transferred 105 items to the Dominion Archives between 1910 and 1919; although in doing so, the militia assumed the archives had assumed responsibility for establishing any future military museum. By the 1910s, the militia began to redirect potential donors of military artifacts to the Dominion Archives. These artifacts, in addition to captured German weapons from the First World War, were exhibited for the first time in a travelling exhibition in 1916. In December 1918, the Commission on War Records and Trophies was established to distribute the materials to memorials across Canada. However, the Commission retained a number of pieces at the Dominion Archives with the hope they would eventually be exhibited in a national museum. In 1924, the War Trophy Building was built adjacent to the original Dominion Archives building to house the military collection. In 1935, Doughty struck a deal with General Andrew McNaughton, the Chief of General Staff, for the militia to support the establishment of the museum. A War Trophies Review Board was established between the archives and militia, charged with selecting the best items to preserve for a future museum. History The Canadian War Museum was formally opened at the War Trophies Building in January 1942; initially operated by the Dominion Archives, and partially funded by the Department of National Defence. In 1958, management of the Canadian War Museum was assumed by the National Museum of Canada (predecessor to the Canadian Museum of History and the Canadian Museum of Nature). The original Dominion Archives building housed the war museum from 1967 to 2005 The museum relocated to the original Dominion Archives building, adjacent to the War Trophies building in June 1967; after the Public Archives of Canada moved its operations to a new facility. However, the museum continued to use the War Trophies building as a storage facility. In the same year, management the war museum was assumed by the National Museums of Canada Corporation; a crown corporation that managed several national institutions, including the war museum. In 1983 the museum relocated its storage facilities from the War Trophies building to Vimy House; with the former building demolished to make way for the National Gallery of Canada's new building. In 1990, the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation (later renamed the Canadian Museum of History Corporation) was formed through The Museum Act, and assumed management of several national museums of Canada, including the war museum. By this time, museum's staff had voiced out that the space in the building was inadequate, with some areas of the building deemed environmentally hazardous for the exhibition of certain artifacts. In 1991, the government established the Task Force on Military History Museum Collections in Canada, whose final report called for more resources to be given to the museum, referring to its shape in the original Dominion Archives building as \\"embarrassing,\\" and a \\"national disgrace.\\" Although the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation invested C$1.7 million for new exhibit designs as a result of the report; funds remained limited for expansion, with the federal government implementing a number of austerity measures during the mid-1990s. A museum's supporter's group, the \\"Friends of the Canadian War Museum\\" was established in 1995 to assist the museum in fundraising efforts. Exterior of Vimy House. From 1983 to 2004, items from museum's collection that were not on display were stored at Vimy House. Between 1996 to 1997, the museum considered opening a large Holocaust exhibition within the museum. In addition to the exhibition, the architectural expansion plans released in November 1997 included enhanced exhibit spaces, a theatre, and a memorial chamber. However, the proposed exhibit was opposed by Canadian veterans, who felt a sense of neglect from the museum, and believed an exhibition on the Holocaust would further marginalize them; in addition to some historians who believed the museum was an inadequate space for such an exhibition. Following events commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War passed, public debate over the museum's future intensified; with the Senate Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs convening a hearing in February 1998 to determine future of the exhibition and the museum itself. Following the Senate Subcommittee hearings, the chair of the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation, Adrienne Clarkson announced that while plans to expand the museum would continue, the plans for the Holocaust exhibition would be abandoned. Barney Danson was later appointed to the board of trustees and the war museum advisory committee; who increased the museum's research capacity, and the establishment of the Centre of Military History. Danson later secured for the museum the acquisition of property near CFB Rockcliffe. In March 2000, the Government of Canada formally announced plans to build a new museum building at CFB Rockcliffe. However, in 2001, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien intervened to have the proposed location changed to LeBreton Flats, former industrial lands. The site was rejected earlier during planning as the area was contaminated, although Chr√©tien proposed that they would decontaminate the area; with the museum serving as the centrepiece revitalization efforts of that area. In 2001, a design submitted by Moriyama & Teshima Architects and Griffiths Rankin Cook Architects was selected for the design of the new building. Groundbreaking for the new building took place in November 2002, followed by a major decontamination effort of the property by the National Capital Commission. Construction for the new museum building in May 2004 By 2004 the museum began to move its larger artifacts from its exhibits, as well as its storage facility into the new building. By the end of 2004, the museum closed its storage facility in Vimy House, and closed its facility in the original Dominion Archives building in January 2005. The new building was opened on 8 May 2005, coinciding with the 60th anniversary of Victory in Europe day. On the same day the new building was opened to the public, Canada Post issued a 50¬¢ stamp, designed, honouring the opening of the new museum. The total cost to build a new building for the museum, and the exhibitions was approximately C$135 million. Shortly after opening the museum became the centre of controversy over its interpretation of the Combined Bomber Offensive during World War II, in which some 20,000 Canadians participated in. Much of the controversy stemmed from two assertions made by on a museum label, that the bombing offensive was largely ineffective until later in the war, and that its morality and value of strategic bombings remained contested. Complaints from Canadian veterans prompted another Senate Subcommittee to be launched. Museum staff eventually removed the offending museum label, replacing it with another label with text three times in length that \\"glossed over the salient facts;\\" although the offending images remained. Site Aerial view of the museum's green roof, with the Ottawa River and Capital Pathway adjacent to the building. The property is situated within LeBreton Flats, a neighbourhood within Ottawa, the capital city of Canada. The property is situated southwest of Parliament Hill and the National War Memorial. The property is bounded by roadways to the east and south, and by the Capital Pathway, and the southern banks of the Ottawa River to the west and north. Water from the Ottawa River is drawn into the building for mechanical cooling, and ground irrigation of the larger property. Directly south of the museum building is an urban park called The Commons, used for various events hosted by the museum. A wheelchair accessible pathway built around the building's green roof connects The Commons with the parkland to the north of the museum. =Building= The was designed by Moriyama & Teshima Architects & Griffiths Rankin Cook Architects; with Raymond Moriyama and Alex Rankin as the principal architect. Stantec was contracted as the civil engineering consultant, whereas PCL Construction was contracted as the project's construction manager. The cost to construct the building was approximately C$96 million. Concrete and glass facade at the north entrance to the museum Regeneration served as the primary theme for the architectural design team of the building, with the design intended to showcase war's impact on nature; and nature's ability to regrow and \\"regenerate\\" from war. Tilted and jagged planes, along with roughhewn materials are used throughout the building in a form of \\"controlled imperfection,\\" intended to create the impression of trauma and disequilibrium. The building's massing largely remains low to the ground, with only the building's eastern portions only rising above the ground. A significant portion of the building is made out of concrete, with of cast in place concrete used throughout the building; in addition to 3,750 tonnes of reinforced steel. Many of the exterior and interior walls of the building are placed on a variety of angles, from 90 degrees to 31 degrees, with eight different angles in all used throughout the building. Exterior With regeneration being the primary theme the architectural design, the external lines of the building were designed to evoke the \\"devastations of war,\\" with the building appearing to emerge from a \\"scarred landscape\\". The angular building was designed to appear as if it was \\"emerging from the Ottawa River. The highest point of the building rises off the ground, and faces towards the Canadian Parliament Buildings, and Peace Tower. A self-seeding green roof, which connects to the surrounding parkland and riverfront, is also situated on the rooftop of the building. The green roof was designed into the museum building in order to reflect the building's larger theme of regeneration; with green rooftop intended to appear as nature fusing with ruins, showcasing the process of regeneration. The green roof also provides the building with some sustainability benefits; being an economical and efficient solution for stormwater management in the area, providing energy savings, and providing air pollution remediation. The roof was designed to mimic the urban development of the area, with the western portions of the rooftop closer to the rural areas of Ottawa designed to blend in with the surrounding parkland, while the eastern portion closer to downtown Ottawa features sloped concrete slopes that provide visitors a view into the museum from the rooftop. Glass fa√ßade on the southeastern portion of the building. Windows along the tall protrusion are arranged to spell \\"lest we forget/n'oubilons jamais in Morse code. Nearly the entire southeastern fa√ßade of the building is covered in glass, providing people outside the museum a view of some of its items on display in the LeBreton Gallery, an open-storage exhibition space in the building. Near the top of the building's walls are a series of small windows that spell out \\"lest we forget/n'oubilons jamais\\" in Morse code. The exposed concrete board-form exterior is fitted with cast-in-place insulated concrete wall panels. Conversely, the entrance of the building is fitted with aluminum frames; with the canted curtain wall facing Parliament Hill. Interior The interior walls of the building are primarily made out of concrete that incorporates up to 15 per cent recycled fly ash, making the walls of the building a large energy-conserving mass. The walls are designed to emerge sharply from the ground, in an unusual fashion; whereas the floors were designed with slight slopes within them. Together, these design features are intended to evoke the feeling of instability with the museum's visitors. All the galleries within the building includes ramps and slopes, making all exhibits in the museum wheelchair accessible. Interior lobby of the Canadian War Museum during an ANZAC Day ceremony. The exterior of Memorial Hall is visible in the background Concrete is a major material used in the museum's lobby; with posttensioned concrete beams extending throughout the foyer, in addition to 596 tonnes of exposed structural steel. One side of the lobby's walls are textured and patterned like rough-hewn wooden planks, whereas the other side is patterned to resemble large blocks of quarried stone. In addition to concrete, cooper that was originally used the roof of the Library of Parliament is used on the walls of the museum lobby and the LeBreton Gallery. However, most of the building's interior space remains austere, in an effort to provide visitors with a solemn space for reflection. A audio-visual presentation of what is contained inside the exhibits is situated at the access point from the main foyer to the exhibition areas. Other educational facilities within the building includes the Military History Resource Centre, a museum library and archive; and the 236-seat Barney Danson Theatre. The war museum's theatre is named in honour of Barney Danson, in recognition of his efforts in supporting the Canadian War Museum. The building also includes a dedicated group entrance; and a sunlit cafeteria along the riverfront portion of the building, with a seasonal terrace; dedicated climate-controlled vaults; and laboratories for on-site repairs of artifacts. Including all areas of the museum, the total gross floor area of the museum building is . Exhibitions The Canadian War Museum functions as a history museum, and as a \\"palace of memory,\\" resulting in many of the museum's permanent exhibitions serving the purpose of being educational exhibits, and a memorial. Permanent exhibitions at the museum include the Canadian Experience Galleries, Memorial Hall, Regeneration Hall, and the Royal Canadian Legion Hall of Honour. The Canadian Experience Galleries are a series of four Canadian military history galleries arranged chronologically. Memorial Hall is the only exhibition that is free to the public, with Memorial Hall being accessible through the lobby. Regeneration Hall is one of several permeant exhibitions at the museum The permanent exhibitions at the museum were designed by Haley Sharpe Design, based in Leicester, UK, and Origin Studios, based in Ottawa. The design team, together with museum historians, crafted its exhibits in which the themes of brutality, geography, politics, and survival are woven throughout most of the exhibitions in the museum. The museum permanent exhibitions are divided into seven zones, and further sub-divided into 25 themed clusters. Graphic interpretive information is spread throughout the exhibits in order to convey textual and visual information to visitors. Exhibition design teams worked in conjunction with the architectural team for the new museum building, providing the exhibition design team with greater influence in how the exhibitions were arranged, positioned, and shaped; a degree of architectural influence not available to exhibition design teams working to fit exhibits in a pre-existing space. The exhibit structures, like the building itself, is angular and trapezoidal, reflecting the museum's theme of regeneration, in addition to enhancing the themes of the exhibits. The exhibition areas in the museum feature austere lines of galvanized steel, concrete, wood, and other hard surfaces with strong, and deep colours. The exhibition areas' design was intended to provide visitors with \\"little comfort or respite,\\" with the \\"fragmented structure of the exhibits,\\" intended to the story of war. Although angular lines are prevalent throughout the design of the building and exhibitions, coloured curved structures are strategically placed throughout the galleries, acting as a counterpoint to the angular design of the building. In addition to permanent exhibitions the museum also organizes and hosts special and travelling exhibitions. =Canadian Experience galleries= The Canadian Experience galleries are a collection of four galleries that take up of space. The four galleries document the military history of Canada, with the four galleries being Early Wars in Canada, South African and the First World War, Second World War, and From the Cold War to the Present. Although some galleries are centred around individual conflicts, events involving Canadians serve as the focus for the galleries, with other events during these conflicts only being briefly addressed. The galleries were intended to \\"enhance the human experiences of war,\\" documenting moments in Canadian military history that helped shaped the country; with many of the exhibits drawing links to the events with larger themes of nationhood and a national identity. Many of the exhibits were designed to simulate the \\"collective perspective\\" of Canadian service members, and Canadians in the homefront to a lesser extent. The galleries are themed after four \\"intertwined principles,\\" geography, brutality, politics, and survival; with each principle serving as the leading themes for a gallery. Visitors are introduced to these principles prior to entering the galleries, with conceptual phrases relating to these principles printed on the walls of the rotunda outside the entrance of the Canadian Experience galleries. The Early Wars in Canada gallery explores First Nations conflicts, as well as conflicts in New France and British North America, and post-confederated Canada in the 19th century. Many of the exhibits showcase how early conflicts in Canada were shaped by geography, and centred around lakes, streams, and rivers. Conflicts covered in this exhibit include the Beaver Wars, Anglo-French conflicts to the Seven Years' War, the American Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and the Northwest Rebellion. The South African and the First World War gallery explores Canadian participation in the Second Boer War and the First World War. The South African and the First World War gallery is styled to resemble Canada during Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee in 1897; intended to mimic the imperialistic fervour that existed during that period. In 2015, the museum opened a new portion of the gallery on the homefront during the First World War, highlighting the Conscription Crisis of 1917, the suffragette movement, and stories from individuals during the war. The Second World War gallery explores the causes of the Second World War, as well as Canada's participation during the conflict. Most of the Second World War exhibit focuses on Canada's role in the Battle of the Atlantic, the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, the European theatre, the homefront and the internment of Japanese Canadians. A small portions of the exhibit are also dedicated to Canadian participation in the Asian and Pacific theatre, and the Holocaust. Objects from the museum's collection exhibited in the Second World War portion of the Canadian Experience galleries includes a Mercedes- Benz 770K previously owned by Adolf Hitler, entitled Hitler's Car: A Symbol of Evil at the exhibit. The museum acquired the Mercedes Benz 770K in 1970, under the assumption that the car formerly belonged to Hermann G√∂ring; although a research report published in 1982 revealed that the vehicle belonged to Hitler. The gallery also houses an M4 Sherman tank named Forceful III, and is dedicated to the members of the Governor General's Foot Guards killed during the Second World War. A memorial plaque to Captain Thomas G. Fuller is also present in the gallery. The final gallery, From the Cold War to the Present, explored Canada's role during the Cold War, and the threat of nuclear war in the public eye. In 2017, the concluding portion of the fourth gallery was updated to include post-Cold War conflicts involving members of the Canadian Armed Forces. The final portion of the gallery was designed to confront visitors with the problematic nature of warfare; and features an interactive space for visitors to leave their own reflections on war, peace, and remembrance. =LeBreton Gallery= Military vehicles and equipment on display at the LeBreton Gallery The LeBreton Gallery: The Military Technology Collection is an open-space gallery that houses a number of military equipment used by Canadian, or other military forces. Situated on the eastern portion of the museum, its eastern walls are made of glass, allowing natural sunlight to illuminate the gallery. Equipment is organized into several sections, land, air, sea, field artillery, armoured fighting vehicles, cannon or mortar, and tanks. Most of the equipment in the gallery have been restored and cleaned, arranged and organized with museum labels that provide details on the equipment. The museum labels accompanying the pieces are focused primarily on the technical aspects of the equipment. The equipment housed in LeBreton Gallery are among the largest items in the museum's collections, and includes a McDonnell CF-101 Voodoo, 19th century artillery pieces, tanks, and other military vehicles. The majority of the lighter wheeled and tracked transport vehicles on display date back to the Second World War or the Cold War era. =Memorial Hall= The interior of Memorial Hall. Its walls are made out of smooth concrete, and are arranged in a grid resembling First World War headstones Situated within the lobby of the museum, Memorial Hall serves as a place for sombre reflection and remembrance. The exhibit's access point is angled upwards; with its doorway designed to provide an illusion of narrowness. The walls surrounding the access point is cladded in copper, and is illuminated only by light fixtures installed in the floor, and a light mounted on the ceiling. The portion of the museum where Memorial Hall is situated in is also aligned on an axis with the Peace Tower of the Canadian Parliament Buildings. Conversely, the walls inside Memorial Hall are made out of smooth concrete, with only a grid pattern resembling the headstones used for Canadian First World War soldiers etched into the walls. The exhibit is illuminated by a skylight that extends beyond from the building's rooftop; while a glass-enclosed pool of water sits on the south side of Memorial Hall. The design of exhibit was intended to provide visitors with the feeling of weightlessness. The exhibit contains a single artifact, the original headstone for the soldier eventually reburied at the Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The hall was designed so that sunlight that passes through the hall's only window illuminates directly onto the headstone once a year, on 11 November at precisely 11 a.m., the time that the armistice that ended the First World War went into effect. =Regeneration Hall= Regeneration Hall is an exhibition that is located in the highest point of the museum building, and serves as a \\"physical representation of hope for a better tomorrow\\". The walls of Regeneration Hall of angled in a manner similar to the buildings on Parliament Hill, with the Peace Tower visible through the eastern glass fa√ßade of the exhibition. The exhibition holds several artworks, including the original models for the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, and the painting Sacrifice by Charles Sims. =Royal Canadian Legion Hall of Honour= The Royal Canadian Legion Hall of Honour exhibit, with the original plaster design for the National War Memorial The Royal Canadian Legion Hall of Honour is a oval-shaped exhibit explores how Canadian military history has been commemorated and honoured throughout history. The original plaster model that was submitted and later chosen in the National War Memorial design competition is exhibited in the centre of the Hall of Honour. Floor-to-ceiling display cases containing certificates of service, letters, medals, models, paintings, photographs, rolls of honour, scrapbooks, and souvenirs are situated along the walls of the exhibit. The exhibit are displayed chronologically, and include items relating to First Nations, New France, British North America, and confederated Canada. However, the majority of the displays are dedicated towards exhibiting items from the 20th century. Items in these displays, along with the individual stories corresponding to each chronological period exhibited in an attempt to convey the various forms of commemorating the war dead throughout Canadian history. Collection Canadian military medals from the museum's collection on display As of 2015, the museum's collection includes over 500,000 pieces. The collection includes correspondences, documents, equipment, maps, medals, military art, military vehicles, and military uniforms. On average, the museum receives 700 offers for donations a year, including individual items or large collections; although, the museum only accepts 100 to 150 of these offers annually. However, Canadian service medals and medals of valour are accepted by the museum unconditionally, as an \\"act of honouring\\". Approximately 2,000 artworks and photographs from the museum's collection are used throughout the museum exhibits; although 500 of these images are enlarged versions of originals. Items from the museum's collection are either displayed in the museum's exhibits, on tour with a travelling exhibitions, loaned out to other institutions, or housed in the museum storage area. From 1982 to 2004, items not on display were stored in off-site facilities; with the Dominion Archives' Trophy Building used as storage from 1967 to 1983, and Vimy House used as storage from 1983 to 2004. During the 20th century, archival materials belonging to the war museum was also held in a warehouse in ByWard Market. In 2004, the museum relocated items held in storage to a new storage space within the new war museum building, and closed its off-site storage facilities. Storage units in the museum's collections vault. The vault holds items from the museum's collection not on display in its exhibits or on loan. The museum's collection originated from the artifacts and archival materials originally held at Cartier Square Military Museum in 1880; including an assortment of weapons; a bell from , the flagship for Admiral Charles Saunders during the 1759 siege of Quebec; and the colours for the Royal Highland Emigrants, and various units from the War of 1812. The collection grew in size during the First World War, with materials from the war transported back to Canada. Following the end of World War II in Europe, the museum dispatched its first collections acquisition team to the Netherlands and Allied-occupied Germany to acquire a large number of German military equipment. During the Cold War, the museum's collection continued to expand with the Canadian Armed Forces transferring its obsolete equipment, as well as examples of enemy equipment to the museum. During the 1990s, the museum also began to acquire a number of materials as gifts from several post- Soviet states. In 1994, the museum's collection held approximately 6,550 posters; with 3,770 posters originating from Canada, 692 from the United Kingdom, 612 from the United States, and the remaining from a variety of countries in Europe, and Australia. In 2019, 39 of the 99 original Victoria Crosses that were awarded to Canadians are held in the collections of the Canadian War Museum. =War art= Military art from the museum's collection on display As of 2015, the museum's Beaverbrook Collection of War Art contained over 13,000 pieces of military art. The majority of the war art works in the collection are on paper, although these works are less often used in museum exhibits than their on canvas counterparts. The museum has been invested in several Canadian war art programs since 1971, after the National Gallery of Canada handed over management of the Canadian War Memorial Fund, and over 5,000 works from its Canadian War Records Collections to the war museum; including all of its war art from the Second World War. The museum's military art collection takes its name from Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook, who established the art collection that later became the Canadian War Records. Although the museum's war art collection included over 13,000 works, only 64 of these pieces depicted a dead body as of 2017. The museum's collection of war art includes over 400 works by Alex Colville. Other artists featured in the collection includes Caroline Armington, Alfred Bastien, Charles Comfort, Alma Duncan, Colin Gill, Bobs Cogill Haworth, Robert Stewart Hyndman, Richard Jack, Frank Johnston, Manly E. MacDonald, Pegi Nicol MacLeod, Mabel May, Jack Nichols, Charles Sims, and Frederick Varley. The collection also includes several models and statues, including the plaster model by Vernon March that was later selected as the design for the National War Memorial. The museum's collection also includes the original scale plaster models by Walter Seymour Allward for the Canadian National Vimy Memorial. From 1937 to 2000, the models were held in storage, before they were exhibited in an exhibition in 2000. The models are now used in the Regeneration Hall exhibition.

The Hartland Molson Library Collection serves as the museum's reference collection on Canadian military history, materials, and rare books; whereas George Metcalf Archival Collection serves as an archive for blueprints, daguerreotypes, films, journals, logbooks, maps, photographs, scrapbooks, and tapes. The research centre includes a general reading area that overlooks the adjacent river, and a specialized reading room for more fragile materials. Depiction of the Canadian Corps' advance during the Battle of Vimy Ridge; drawn by the Historical Section of the General Staff, 1917. The map is one of a number of cartographical materials held in the museum's archives. Although the War Trophies Review Board initially planned for the museum to include an archives, the museum did little archival work until 1967. The archiving of war-related documents was primarily undertaken by Public Archives of Canada up until that point; although the Public Archives voluntarily turned over war materials sent to the archives to the war museum. After the closure of the Public Archive's history museum in 1967, materials and documents from the museum were split between the National Museum of Man (now the Canadian Museum of History), and the Canadian War Museum. As a result of the closure of the Public Archive's history museum, the Public Archives began to regularly transfer archival documents to the war museum. In 1982, the museum's archival collection was reorganized into several categories, souvenirs, museum, manuscripts, maps, plans and blueprints, and Canadian War Museum records. The Military History Research Centre's oral history archive contained nearly 400 interviews in 2007. The oral history collection was started by the museum in 1999. The program devised topic lists to guide interviews towards certain areas of interests; although the framing of the topics are designed to allow for in- depth conversation, one free of bias. Interviews were either conducted by the museum's research team, or ex-military officers, and averaged 90 minutes in length. Subjects of interviews includes service members who served in the Second World War, United Nations Emergency Force, Canadian Forces Europe, Yugoslav Wars, and the War in Afghanistan. Specific subjects interviewed include Airborne Intercept Navigators in NATO and NORAD, deputy commanders of NORAD, and all former Canadian commanders of STANAVFORLANT. In 2000, the museum's photographic archives contained over 600 photograph collections or fonds; holding more than 17,000 individual photographs, and more than 250 photo albums. The collection was largely obtained through private sources, most of whom had taken the photo as participants in these conflicts.

It is named after Karl Weissenberg. The dimensionless number compares the elastic forces to the viscous forces. It can be variously defined, but it is usually given by the relation of stress relaxation time of the fluid and a specific process time. For instance, in simple steady shear, the Weissenberg number, often abbreviated as Wi or We, is defined as the shear rate \\\\dot{\\\\gamma} times the relaxation time \\\\lambda. Using the Maxwell Model and the Oldroyd Model, the elastic forces can be written as the first Normal force (N1). :\\\\text{Wi} = \\\\dfrac{ \\\\mbox{elastic forces} }{ \\\\mbox{viscous forces} } = \\\\frac{\\\\tau_{xx}-\\\\tau_{yy}}{\\\\tau_{xy}} = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda\\\\mu\\\\dot{\\\\gamma}^2}{\\\\mu\\\\dot{\\\\gamma}}= \\\\dot{\\\\gamma} \\\\lambda.\\\\, Since this number is obtained from scaling the evolution of the stress, it contains choices for the shear or elongation rate, and the length-scale. Therefore the exact definition of all non dimensional numbers should be given as well as the number itself. While Wi is similar to the Deborah number and is often confused with it in technical literature, they have different physical interpretations. The Weissenberg number indicates the degree of anisotropy or orientation generated by the deformation, and is appropriate to describe flows with a constant stretch history, such as simple shear. In contrast, the Deborah number should be used to describe flows with a non-constant stretch history, and physically represents the rate at which elastic energy is stored or released.

It is located 10.4 miles (16.7 km) south east of Charing Cross, bordering Elmstead to the north, Chislehurst to the north-east and east, Petts Wood to the south-east, Southborough to the south, Bromley to the south-west and west and Widmore to the north-west. It is known for its large and expensive houses. History The area's name is first recorded in 1279, the 'ley' or 'lea' referring to a forest clearing, and 'Bicca' either meaning a pointed ridge, or else a personal name. The area remained rural, save for a small hunting lodge belonging to the Wells family dating to 1759. The Lodge was gradually enlarged to become Bickley Hall, a classical house designed by Robert Mylne, FRS, for John Wells, shipbuilder, in 1780 (demolished 1963). His brother William, shipbuilder and a director of Greenwich Hospital, inherited the estate, and his son John commissioned additions by Robert Smirke in 1810. John Wells began selling part of his lands in 1841 following due to financial difficulties, and by the late 1850s a few large houses had been built in the area, aided by the opening of Bickley railway station (formerly named Southborough Road) in 1858 and Chislehurst station in 1865. Much of the area was purchased and developed by George Wythes, who commissioned numerous large houses for the wealthy classes, most of them designed by Richard Norman Shaw and Ernest Newton and, in the early part of the following century, C. H. B. Quennell St George's Church was built in 1865, and a cricket ground in 1868. Smaller-scale development continued throughout the early 20th century, and several of the older, larger properties demolished or sub-divided. The area today remains a wealthy one, characterised by large detached housing.  Parks in Bickley =Jubilee Country Park= With entrances in Thornet Wood Road and Blackbrook lane, there are 62 acres (25 hectares) of wildflower meadows, hedgerows and semi-natural ancient woodland. There is a cycle route through this park to Petts Wood. The London LOOP footpath also goes through Jubilee Park and it is linked to National Trust countryside at Petts Wood and beyond that to Scadbury Park Nature Reserve. =Whitehall Recreation Ground= A large play area on Southlands Road with a children's playground. =Widmore Recreation Ground= A small local park with a children's playground which has entrances in Pembroke Road, Lewes Road and Tylney Road.

Many traditional Mexican songs are internationally known, including Mar√≠a Grever's first international hit \\"J√∫rame\\" (\\"Swear to me\\"), and her song \\"Te Quiero Dijiste\\" (English version \\"Magic Is the Moonlight\\"), written for the 1944 Esther Williams film, \\"Sinfon√≠a India\\" (\\"Indian Symphony\\"), \\"La Noche de los Mayas\\" (\\"The Night of the Maya\\"), \\"Huapango\\" by Moncayo, \\"Sobre las Olas\\" (\\"Over the Waves\\"), \\"La Sandunga\\", \\"Cielito Lindo\\" (\\"Beautiful Sweetheart\\"), \\"Perfidia\\", \\"B√©same Mucho\\" (\\"Kiss Me a Lot\\"), \\"Solamente una vez\\" (English version \\"You Belong to My Heart\\"), \\"Esta Tarde Vi Llover\\" (English version \\"Yesterday I Heard the Rain\\"), \\"Somos Novios\\" (English version \\"It's Impossible\\" (We Are Dating), \\"¬°Ay, Jalisco, no te rajes!\\" (\\"Jalisco, Don't give up!\\"), Lilongo, and \\"Jesusita en Chihuahua\\" (\\"Jesusita in Chihuahua\\"). Other famous songs include \\"M√©xico Lindo y Querido\\" (\\"Beautiful, Beloved Mexico\\"), \\"Jarabe Tapat√≠o' (known internationally as \\"The Mexican Hat Dance\\"), \\"Flor de azalea\\" (\\"Azalea flower\\"), \\"Dulce Patria\\" (\\"Sweet Fatherland\\"), \\"Rayito de Luna\\" (\\"Little Moonbeam\\"), \\"Malague√±a Salerosa,\\" \\"El Rey\\" (\\"The King\\"), \\"El Triste\\" (\\"The Sad One\\"), La llorona (\\"The Weeping Woman\\"), \\"El reloj\\", (\\"The Clock\\"), \\"Pelea de Gallos en la Feria de San Marcos\\" (\\"The Cockfight at San Marcos Fair\\"), \\"Cien A√±os\\" (\\"One Hundred Years\\"), \\"Esclavo y Amo\\" (\\"Slave and Master\\"), \\"Cucurrucuc√∫ Paloma\\" (\\"Cucurrucucu Dove\\"), \\"La Ley del Monte\\" (\\"The law of the Countryside\\"), \\"La Bikina\\", \\"Por Debajo de la Mesa\\" (\\"Under the Table\\"), \\"La Media Vuelta,\\" (\\"Half a Turn Around\\") \\"La Bamba\\", \\"Amor Eterno\\" (\\"Eternal Love\\"), and \\"Simplemente Amigos\\" (\\"Just Friends\\"). History of Mexican music Carlos Ch√°vez, composer Los Folkloristas a musical group formed in Mexico City in 1966 and dedicated to the research, execution, and dissemination of traditional Latin American music. Since its creation, almost fifty musicians have passed through the group. The foundation of Mexican music comes from its indigenous sounds and heritage. The original inhabitants of the land used drums (such as the teponaztli), flutes, rattles, conches as trumpets and their voices to make music and dances. This ancient music is still played in some parts of Mexico. However, much of the traditional contemporary music of Mexico was written during and after the Spanish colonial period, using many old world influenced instruments. Many traditional instruments, such as the Mexican vihuela used in Mariachi music, were adapted from their old world predecessors and are now considered very Mexican. There existed regional and local musical traditions in the colonial period and earlier, but a national music began to develop in the nineteenth century, often with patriotic themes of national defense and against foreign invaders. Conservative general and president Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna brought a Catalan music master, Jaime Nun√≥, from nearby Cuba to create a network of military bands on a national scale. He composed the music to the Mexican national anthem. During the French Intervention in Mexico, which placed Maximilian of Habsburg on the throne of the French empire in Mexico, many musicians accompanied his entourage and he established the National Conservatory of Music in 1866. Susana Harp singer of Mexican traditional music. Liberal President Benito Ju√°rez saw the need to create military bands.Vel√°zquez and Vaughan, \\"Mestizaje and Musical Nationalism in Mexico\\", p. 95. Village brass bands proliferated in the late nineteenth century, with concerts in town squares, often on a central kiosk.Guy P.C. Thomson, \\"The Ceremonial and Political Roles of Village Bands, 1846‚Äì1974\\" in Rituals of Rule, Rituals of Resistance, eds. William Beezley, Cheryl Martin, and William French. Wilmington: Scholarly Resources 1974 During the Porfiriato, musical styles expanded, with Mexican national music, cosmopolitan music brought by foreign elites, and European regional music such as polkas, mazurkas, and waltzes, as well as opera overtures. Musicians had access to and used sheet music, indicating musical literacy. In some indigenous regions, new music and bands helped bring a level of unity. In Oaxaca, a waltz, \\"Dios nunca muere\\" (God never dies) became the state's anthem, linking regional patriotism with God.Vel√°zquez and Vaughan, \\"Mestizaje and Musical Nationalism in Mexico\\", p. 96 A variety of musical styles from elsewhere were incorporated into Mexican popular music in the nineteenth century, including Afro-Caribbean rhythms from Cuba and Haiti. Music, dance, and poetry flourished in the Porfiriato. Mexico's National Conservatory of Music was strongly influenced by Italian masters, who gave way to French influence at the turn of the twentieth century. Guadalupe Pineda one of Mexico's grassroots musical icons. Following the Revolution, Venustiano Carranza, leader of the winning Constitutionalist faction of the Revolution, mandated that the National Conservatory \\"recover the national\\" in its musical education, abandoning rather than privileging foreign music.Younger Mexican composers emerged, including Carlos Ch√°vez, Silvestre Revueltas, and Luis Sandi, who developed Mexican \\"art music.\\" Ch√°vez was a prolific composer and one who embraced creating Mexican orchestral music drawing on revolutionary corridos, and composed an Aztec-themed ballet. He became the director of the National Conservatory of Music, which became affiliated with the Ministry of Education (SEP). Revueltas composed music for the new, emerging Mexican cinema, and Sandi created choral works, creating music for civic events, as well as incorporating indigenous music from the Yaqui and Maya regions in his compositions.Vel√°zquez and Vaughan, \\"Mestizaje and Musical Nationalism in Mexico\\", pp. 100, 103 Ch√°vez is seen as the driving force behind the split between of Mexican art music and traditional styles, privileging art music. However, traditional or folkloric music continues to be popular, and the Ballet Folkl√≥rico de M√©xico, established in 1952, performs regularly at Bellas Artes. Traditional folk music Mexican traditional folk music can be classified in two aspects: Pedro Vargas was known as the \\"Nightingale of the Americas\\". * By types of musical forms and styles: corrido, canci√≥n Ranchera, Yucatecan trova, Son Huasteco, Yucatecan jarana, Son Jarocho, Mexican Danz√≥n, Mexican Bolero, Son istme√±o, Son Jaliscience, Chilena, Son calentano, Son Planeco, and Canto cardenche. * By types of ensembles: banda, Yucatecan trio, conjunto calentano, conjunto huasteco, conjunto jarocho, conjunto norte√±o, Yucatecan jarana ensemble, mariachi, and marimba. Son Jarocho group Zarahuato performing at the Museo de Arte Popular. Marimba, introduced during the 17th and 18th century to Central America, the instrument has played a prominent role in Mayan-Tzotzil music of Chiapa. Band otomi with instruments made out of Calabash. Its formal structure is based on the alternation of instrumental sections and the singing of short poetic units called coplas. The mode is usually major, with harmonic vocabulary mostly limited to progressions drawing from I, IV, II7, V and V5. Triple meter (6/8, 3/4, or a combination of both) predominates, with many exceptions in duple meter.The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music. Taylor & Francis. 2000. p. 606. . Son is performed most often by giant ensembles in which string instruments predominate, with notable region- specific exceptions like marimba ensembles and wind ensembles. Mexican Son music developed from the mixing of Spanish music with indigenous music of different regions, hence the music exhibited much variation across the country, in rhythm, melody, and instrumentation. Mariachi can be considered one type of Mexican son. Mexican son also includes various miscellaneous styles. The guitar is universally present in nearly all Mexican son subgenres. Other instruments may include trumpets, violins, and accordions. * Abaje√±o music from Jalisco, Colima, and Michoac√°n. Indigenous communities have produced their own variants of Mexican son, which is otherwise a primarily mestizo genre. The Pur√©pecha (from Michoac√°n) are known for the sones abaje√±os, which are often played alongside pirekuas, a form of native love song. Famous bands include Atardecer and Erandi. * Chilena from the Costa Chica regions in Guerrero and Oaxaca. * Istme√±os originates from the Zapotecs of Oaxaca and is known for love songs, and the people's sones istme√±os, which are sung in both Zapotec and Spanish. The music has been popularized, primarily by pop stars from outside the area, including Lila Downs. * Son calentano is a melodically complex violin music from the Balsas River Basin of southern Mexico. Juan Reynoso is especially popular, and has won the National Prize for Arts and Sciences. * Sones de arpa grande developed in an arid, hot area of western Mexico. It is dominated by a harp, accompanied by violins and guitars. Originally confined to poor rural areas and urban brothels, sones de arpa grande is now popular among the suburban and urban middle- and upper- class audiences. Juan P√©rez Morf√≠n and Beto Pineda are the best-known performers. * Son Huasteco music, from the Huasteca territory, this music is played in the states of Hidalgo, Veracruz, San Luis Potos√≠ and Zacatecas and the fiddle is accompanied with jarana huasteca and huapanguera. Two guitarists sing in a falsetto with accompaniment by a violin. Improvisation is common. Los Camperos de Valle, Harmonia Huasteca, Los Hermanos Calderon and Trio Tamazunchale are especially influential performers. * Son Jarocho music comes from the Veracruz area, and is distinguished by a strong African influence. International acclaim has been limited, including the major hit La Bamba. The most legendary performer is Graciana Silva, whose releases on Discos Corason made inroads in Europe. Southern Veracruz is home to a distinct style of Jarochos that is characteristically lacking a harp, is played exclusively by requinto or jarana guitars, and is exemplified by the popular modern band Mono Blanco. * Son Jalisciense is from Jalisco and Colima and has both instrumental and versed songs in this form, mostly in major keys. Most performers consider this 3/4, but some consider it alternating 3/4 and 6/8. =Corrido= Joan Sebastian Corrido music is a popular narrative song of poetry form, a ballad. Various themes are featured in Mexican corridos, and corrido lyrics are often old legends (stories) and ballads about a famed criminal or hero in the rural frontier areas of Mexico. Some corridos may also be love stories there are also corridos about women (La Venganza de Maria, Laurita Garza, La tragedia de Rosita, and la adelita) and couples, not just about men. Some even talk about fiction or a made-up story by the composer. Contemporary corridos written within the past few decades feature more modern themes such as drug trafficking (narcocorridos) and immigration. A common example is la Cucaracha, which derives from an Arabic sailors' song from the Moors from before the Reconquista. The corrido has a rhythm similar to that of the European waltz; corridos, like rancheras, have introductory instrumental music and adornos interrupting the stanzas of the lyrics. However, unlike rancheras, the rhythm of a corrido remains fairly consistent, rancheras can be played at a variety of rhythms. Corridos often tell stories, while rancheras are for dancing. Groups who sing corridos include Los Invasores de Nuevo Le√≥n and Los Alegres de Ter√°n. Son Huasteca trio at the Alfredo Guati Rojo National Watercolor Museum in Mexico City =By types of ensembles= Conjunto jarocho Ensemble specialized in Son Jarocho. It consists of jarana jarocha, requinto jarocho, arpa, pandero. Conjunto huasteco Ensemble specialized in Son Huasteco. It consists of guitarra huapanguera, jarana huasteca, violin. Conjunto de marimba Ensemble specialized in folk music of traditional marimba. It consists of marimba, double bass and drums. Mariachi Silvestre Vargas (1901‚Äì85), violins and musician of the Mariachi Vargas from 1921 to 1975, director from 1931 to 1955. Mariachi is an ensemble that consists of guitarr√≥n, vihuela, guitar, violins and trumpets. Between 1940 and 1960 mariachi and rancheras originated in the western states of the country. This folk ensemble performs ranchera, son de mariachi, huapango de mariachi, polka, corrido, and other musical forms. It originated in the southern part of the state of Jalisco during the 19th century. The city of Guadalajara in Jalisco is known as the \\"Capital of Mariachi\\". The style is now popular throughout Mexico and the Southwestern United States, and is considered representative of Mexican music and culture. Lola Beltr√°n and Aida Cuevas 1976 This style of music is played by a group consisting of five or more musicians who wear charro suits. The golden age of mariachi was in the 1950s, when the ranchera style was common in movies. Mariachi Vargas played for many of these soundtracks, and the long-lived band's long career and popular acclaim has made it one of the best-known mariachi. These movies became very popular in Latin America and mariachi's became very popular in places such as Colombia and Peru until this date. There are different theories as to the provenance of the word mariachi. Some say it comes from the French word because it was the type of music often played at weddings and by most folk people by the name of Evan Strout. However, mariachi originates from a part of Mexico that the French never visited and, even if they had, it began before their arrival in 1864. Another theory is that the word comes from the indigenous name of the Pilla or Cirimo tree, whose wood is used to make guitars. It has also been said that the name comes from a festival in honor of a virgin known as Maria H. that musicians played for and that over time they were given this name. Plaza Garibaldi The traditional mariachi band consists of the violin, the vihuela, guitar, a guitarr√≥n (large bass guitar) and a trumpet. Other instruments may also be seen in a mariachi band, such as the flute, French horn, accordion, or organ are used. These instruments are used for specific arrangements. Mariachis playing at the Tenampa in Mexico City Mexican music was popularized in the United States in the late 1970s as part of a revival of mariachi music led by performers like Linda Ronstadt, Vikki Carr and Pepe Aguilar. Other famous mariachi performers include Jos√© Alfredo Jim√©nez, Jorge Negrete, Pedro Infante, Javier Sol√≠s, Miguel Aceves Mej√≠a, Lola Beltr√°n, Antonio Aguilar, Flor Silvestre, Lucha Villa, Vicente Fern√°ndez, Pedro Fern√°ndez, Alejandro Fern√°ndez, Aida Cuevas and Pablo Montero. A well known examples of Mexican music in the United States is the Jarabe Tapat√≠o (called the Mexican Hat Dance in the United States). Other well known mariachi songs are Guadalajara, \\"La Culebra\\" (The Viper), Las alazanas (The alazans) and Son de la negra. Tito Gu√≠zar sings All√° en el Rancho Grande. In Mexico City, the center of mariachi music remains Garibaldi Plaza. The plaza fills with mariachi musicians to solicit gigs from individual songs for passers-by to being hired for events such as weddings and baptisms. They even stand on Eje Central in front of the plaza to flag down passing cars. In 2010, the government renovated the plaza to make it more tourist-friendly, adding new paving, gardens, police, security cameras, painted facades, and a museum dedicated to mariachi and tequila. Although mariachis can be hired in Mexico City over the phone or on the internet, many people still prefer to come to the plaza, hear the musicians and haggle over the price. About 2,500 mariachis hold union cards to work in the plaza, but as many as 4,000 may circulate through on a busy weekend. In 2011 UNESCO recognized the music as an Intangible Cultural Heritage, joining six others of this list from Mexico. Conjunto norte√±o Los Tigres del norte Ensemble specialized in norte√±o music, it consists of diatonic accordion, bajo sexto, double bass and drums. Another important music style is musica norte√±a, from northern Mexico, which has been the basis for such subgenres as musica de banda. Musica Norte√±a, like musica Tejana, arose in the 1830s and 40s in the Rio Grande region, in the southern Texas. Influenced by both Bohemian music and immigrant miners, its rhythm was derived from European polkas, which were popular during the 1800s. This type of Mexican music has derived from singers like Los Rel√°mpagos del Norte, Ramon Ayala, Los Tigres del Norte, Los Tucanes de Tijuana, Polo Ur√≠as, Conjunto Primavera, Narciso Mart√≠nez, El Potro de Sinaloa, and Calibre 50. Banda Banda Sinaloense at the start of 1900. Banda music was made with the imitation of military bands that were imported during the Second Mexican Empire, headed by emperor Maximilian I of Mexico in the 1860s. Polish and German immigrants established themselves in the state of Sinaloa. It was further popularized during the Mexican Revolution when local authorities and states formed their own bands to play in the town squares. Banda el Recodo renowned as \\"the mother of all bands\\" Revolutionary leaders like Pancho Villa, also took wind bands with them wherever they went. Banda has to this day remained popular throughout the central and northern states. It has, however, diversified into different styles due to regions, instruments and modernization. Today people associate banda with Sinaloense. Although banda music is played by many bands from different parts of Mexico, its original roots are in Sinaloa, made popular by bands from Sinaloa. Banda Sinaloense experienced international popularity in the 1990s. Unlike tamborazo Zacatecano, Sinaloense's essential instrument is the tuba. Sometimes an accordion is also included. Some well-known artists are Banda el Recodo, Banda Cuisillos, La Arrolladora Banda El Lim√≥n, Banda Los Recoditos, Banda Machos, Banda Maguey, El Coyote y Su Banda Tierra Santa, Banda Carnaval, Banda MS, Julio Preciado, Graciela Beltr√°n, Juli√≥n √Ålvarez, Espinoza Paz, and Juan Francisco Elizalde Valencia etc. Mexican group Calibre 50 receive an award by streaming service Pandora Radio for being the first artists to surpass a billion streams each in that platform. Tamborazo Zacatecano Tamborazo Zacatecano (\\"drum-beat from Zacatecas\\") is a banda style traditionally played by two trumpets, two saxophones, and the al bass drum. An outstanding example is La Marcha de Zacatecas (The March of Zacatecas) by Genaro Codina Fern√°ndez, the anthem of the State of Zacatecas and considered the second national anthem of Mexico. Tamborazo is closely related to traditional brass Banda. However, Tamborazo uses saxophones instead of clarinets. Another difference from banda is that Tamborazo uses its drum consistently, as opposed to banda which distributes the use of the other instruments throughout a song. Tamborazo originated in Villanueva in the state of Zacatecas. Tamborazo bands: Tamborazo Jerez 75, Tamborazo Los Originales de Jerez and Tamborazo Pancho Villa. =Duranguense= Duranguense is a genre of Mexican music. It is popular among the Mexican-American community in the United States. Duranguense is closely related to the Mexican styles of banda and norte√±o. The main instruments, which are held over from banda, are the saxophone, trombone, and bass drum. However, what sets the duranguense ensemble apart from banda is the addition of synthesizers to play both melodies and the tuba bassline. The tempo is also noticeably faster than banda or norte√±o. Among the duranguense elements carried over from other genres is el tamborazo; a heavy percussion line consisting of the bass drum and varied snare drum rolls. Duranguense groups and singers in Mexico are El Trono de M√©xico, Patrulla 81, AK-7, Remmy Valenzuela, and Ariel Camacho. Popular music of folk roots =Grupera= Los Temerarios Grupera (or onda grupera) is a genre of Mexican popular music. It is influenced by the styles of cumbia, norte√±o, and ranchera, and reached the height of its popularity in the 1980s, especially in rural areas. The music has roots in the rock groups of the 1960s but today generally consists of five or fewer musicians using electric guitars, keyboards and drums. Artists in this genre include Los Yonics, Los Temerarios, Los Bukis, La Mafia, Ana B√°rbara, Alicia Villarreal, Mariana Seoane, Grupo Bryndis, Marco Antonio Sol√≠s, Lidia √Åvila, Los Caminantes, Los Humildes, La Migra, Liberaci√≥n, Pegasso, and Grupo Mojado. The music increased in popularity in the 1990s and became commercially viable, and is now recognized in some Latin music awards ceremonies such as Lo Nuestro and the Latin Grammy Awards. The original wave of Mexican rock bands got their start mostly with Spanish covers of popular English rock songs. After this initial stage they moved on to include in their repertoire traditional ranchera songs, in addition to cumbia, and ballads. Thus the 1970s saw the rise of a number of grupera bands that specialized in slow ballads and songs that up to that point had only been sung with mariachi. Among these we can include Los Muecas, Los Freddys, Los Babys, etc. Popular music =Pop= Statue of crooner Jos√© Jos√© El Pr√≠ncipe de la Canci√≥n (The Prince of Song) in Mexico City. During the 1960s and 1970s most of the pop music produced in Mexico consisted of Spanish-language versions of English- language rock-and-roll hits. Singers and musical groups like Ang√©lica Mar√≠a, Johnny Laboriel, Alberto V√°zquez, Enrique Guzm√°n or Los Teen Tops performed cover versions of songs by Elvis Presley, Paul Anka, Nancy Sinatra and others. The Mexican music market serves as a launching pad to stardom for many non- Mexican artists who are interested extending the market-range of their music. For the last thirty years, Mexican pop music has been led by teen pop bands and their former members. Specially teen pop bands of the last decades have been Timbiriche, OV7, Sentidos Opuestos and RBD. Unlike teen pop bands elsewhere, the Mexican audience tends to prefer mixed-gender combos over boys or girls bands. In 2000, the century saw the crossover of some of Mexican recording artist like Paulina Rubio and Thal√≠a into the English music industry, with bilingual albums, compilation album, that included hit songs in English and Spanish language, and the firsts solo English-language albums by this Mexican pop artist. The best recording crossover artist has been Paulina Rubio with her first English-language album being Border Girl released on June 18, 2002. Thalia has collaborated with American singer of traditional pop standards Tony Bennett in a duet for the song \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\". Viva Duets is the studio album by Tony Bennett, released in October 2012. It consists of electronically assembled duets between Bennett and younger singers from various genres like Frank Sinatras \\"Duets II\\". In Duets II, Sinatra personally invited Luis Miguel to participate on a duet in the album for the song \\"Come Fly with Me\\". Luis Miguel has been dubbed several times by the press and the media as the \\"Latin Frank Sinatra\\". The best-known Mexican pop singers are Jos√© Mar√≠a Napole√≥n, Juan Gabriel, Luc√≠a M√©ndez, Ana Gabriel, Daniela Romo, Marco Antonio Sol√≠s, Yuri, Gloria Trevi, Lucero, Ang√©lica Rivera, Luis Miguel, Sasha Sokol, Thal√≠a, Paulina Rubio, Alessandra Rosaldo, Reyli, Bibi Gayt√°n, Edith M√°rquez, Fey, Aracely Ar√°mbula, Ir√°n Castillo, Lynda Thomas, Natalia Lafourcade, Paty Cant√∫, Anah√≠, Maite Perroni, Dulce Mar√≠a, Ximena Sari√±ana, Yuridia, Daniela Luj√°n, Belinda Peregr√≠n, Sof√≠a Reyes, Kika Edgar, Carlos Rivera and groups like Camila, Sin Bandera, Ha*Ash, Jesse & Joy, Belanova, Playa Limbo, and Jotdog. =Rock= Man√° The Mexican rock movement started in the late 1940s and early 1960s, rapidly becoming popular, and peaking in the 1969 and 1990s with real authentic sounds and styles. One of the early Mexican rock bands came out of the predominantly Mexican barrio community of East Los Angeles, \\"Los N√≥madas\\" (The Nomads). They were the first racially integrated Rock and Roll band of the 1950s, consisting of 3 Mestizo boys, Chico Vasquez, Jose 'J.D.' Moreno, Abel Padilla, and a Caucasian boy Bill Aken (Billy Mayorga Aken). The adopted son of classical guitarist Francisco Mayorga and Mexican movie actress Lupe Mayorga, Aken was mentored by family friend, jazz guitarist Ray Pohlman and would later become rocker Zane Ashton, arranging music and playing lead guitar for everybody from Elvis to Nina Simone. His association with the other three boys would be a lifelong one and they stayed together as a band for more than thirty years. Mexican Rock combined the traditional instruments and stories of Mexico in its songs. Mexican and Latin American rock en espa√±ol remain very popular in Mexico, surpassing other cultural interpretations of rock and roll, including British rock. Caf√© Tacuba performing in Pontevedra, Spain In the 1960s and '70s, during the PRI government, most rock bands were forced to appear underground, that was the time after Av√°ndaro (a Woodstock-style Mexican festival) in which groups like El Tri, Enigma, Los Dug Dug's, Javier B√°tiz and many others arose. During that time Mexican Carlos Santana became famous after performing at Woodstock. During the 80s Nar Mattaru formed in 1995 in Monterrey. N.L. and 90s many Mexican bands went to the surface and popular rock bands like Santa Sabina, Caf√© Tacuba, Caifanes, Control Machete, Fobia, Los de Abajo, Molotov, Man√°, Ely Guerra, Julieta Venegas and Maldita Vecindad achieved a large international following. Zo√© the band has achieved success in Mexico and most Spanish-speaking countries The latter are \\"grandfathers\\" to the Latin ska movement. Mexico City has also a considerable movement of bands playing surf rock inspired in their outfits by local show-sport lucha libre. In the late 1990s, Mexico had a new wave \\"resurgence\\" of rock music with bands like Jumbo, Zo√©, Porter, etc., as well as instrumentalists Rodrigo y Gabriela and Los Jaig√ºey the band of Santa Sabina's bass player, Poncho Figueroa, along with brothers Gustavo Jacob & Ricardo Jacob in the late 2000s. Extreme metal has been popular for a long time in Mexico, with bands such as Dilemma, Exanime formed in 1985 in Monterrey. N.L. The Chasm, Xiuhtecuhtli, Disgorge, Brujeria, Transmetal, Hacavitz, Sargatanas, Mictlayotl, Yaoyotl, Ereshkigal, Xibalba, and Calvarium Funestus. The Mexican metal fanbase is credited with being amongst one of the most lively and intense, and favorites for European metal bands to perform for. Alejandra Guzm√°n's 26 years of artistic career, with more than 10 million albums sold, 16 released albums and 30 singles in radio's Top 10 hits, has earned her the title of La Reina del Rock (The Queen of Rock). She is the daughter of two Latin entertainment legends: movie icon Silvia Pinal and rock and roll legend Enrique Guzm√°n, from whom she inherits her talent and passion for arts, music, dance and constant spiritual growth, but in the real mexican vision her as seen like a pop singer, not real rock. =Latin alternative= Lila Downs in the \\"National Sor Juana Festival\\" 2007. An eclectic range of influences is at the heart of Latin alternative, a music created by young players who have been raised not only on their parents' music but also on rock, hip-hop and electronica. It represents a sonic shift away from regionalism and points to a new global Latin identity. The name \\"Latin alternative\\" was coined in the late 1990s by American record company executives as a way to sell music that was -literally‚Äîall over the map. It was marketed as an alternative to the slick, highly produced Latin pop that dominated commercial Spanish-language radio, such as Ricky Martin or Paulina Rubio. Artists within the genre, such as Rodrigo y Gabriela, Carla Morrison, Caf√© Tacuba, Hello Seahorse!, Porter, Juan Son, Austin TV Lila Downs, Pat√© de Fu√°, Julieta Venegas and Jenny and the Mexicats have set out to defy traditional expectations of Latin music. =Mexican ska= Panteon Rococo Ska entered Mexico in the 1960s, when both small bands like Los Matem√°ticos and big orchestras like Orquestra de Pablo Beltr√°n Ru√≠z recorded both original ska tunes and covers of Jaimacan hits.skayeye.blogspot.mx/ After early new wave bands of the early eighties like Ritmo Peligroso and Kenny y los El√©ctricos incorporated ska into their post-punk sound, a more punk-influenced brand of Ska started being produced in Mexico City in the late eighties, and the genre enjoyed its highest popularity during the early 2000s, even though it is still very popular today. Mexican Ska groups include Pante√≥n Rococ√≥ (Mexico City), Inspector (Nuevo Leon), Control Machete, La Maldita Vecindad (Mexico City), Mama Pulpa (Mexico City) and Tijuana No! (Tijuana, Baja California; originally named Radio Chantaje). =Electronic= Some of the best Mexican composers for electronic and electroacoustic media are Javier Torres Maldonado, Murcof and Manuel Rocha Iturbide, the later conducting festivals and workshops of experimental music and art, in Mexico City and Paris. Some exponents are 3Ball MTY, Nortec Collective, Wakal, Kobol (band), Murcof, Hocico & Deorro and Mexican Institute of Sound. Other music of Latin-American roots Agust√≠n Lara Other popular forms of music found in various parts of Mexico ‚Äì mostly with origins in other parts of the Caribbean and Latin America include rumba, mambo, Cha cha ch√°, Danz√≥n, and bolero. Rumba came from the black Mexican slaves in Veracruz, Mexico City, and Yucat√°n. The style began in Cuba and later became famous in the black community of Mexico. From the beginning of the 20th century, bolero arrived to Yucat√°n, and Danz√≥n to Veracruz. Both styles became very popular all over the country, and a Mexican style of both rhythms was developed. In the 1940s, the Cubans P√©rez Prado, Benny Mor√© emigrated to Mexico, they brought with them the mambo, which became extremely popular especially in Mexico City, later on mambo developed into Cha cha ch√°, which was also popular. =Bolero= Armando Manzanero widely considered the premier Mexican romantic composer of the postwar era. The Cuban bolero has traveled to Mexico and the rest of Latin America after its conception, where it became part of their repertoires. Some of the bolero's leading composers have come from nearby countries, most especially the prolific Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hern√°ndez; another example is Mexico's Agust√≠n Lara. Some Cuban composers of the bolero are listed under Trova. Some successful Mexican bolero composers are Mar√≠a Grever, Gonzalo Curiel Barba, Gabriel Ruiz, and Consuelo Vel√°zquez which song Verdad Amarga (Bitter Truth) was the most popular in Mexico in the year 1948. Another composer Armando Manzanero widely considered the premier Mexican romantic composer of the postwar era and one of the most successful composers of Latin America has composed more than four hundred songs, fifty of which have given him international fame. His most famous songs include Voy a apagar la luz (I'm Going to Turn Off the Lights), Contigo Aprend√≠ (With you I Learnt... ), Adoro (Adore), No s√© t√∫ (I don't know if you...), Por Debajo de la Mesa (Under the Table) Esta Tarde Vi Llover (English version \\"Yesterday I Heard the Rain\\"), Somos Novios (English version \\"It's Impossible\\"), Felicidad (Happiness) and Nada Personal (Nothing Personal). Some renowned trios rom√°nticos were Trio Los Panchos, Los Tres Ases, Los Tres Diamantes and Los Dandys. Trio Bolero, a unique ensemble of two guitars and one cello. Other singers in singing boleros in Mexico are √ìscar Ch√°vez, Jos√© √Ångel Espinoza and √Ålvaro Carrillo. Included among the acclaimed interpreters of the bolero on the radio and the international concert stage were the Mexican tenors Juan Arvizu and Nestor Mesta Chayres.Biographies ‚Äì Egly Hill Marin First ‚Äì Nestor Mesta Chayres ‚Äì M√©jico Biography of Nestor Mesta Chayres by Egly Colina Mar√≠n oneglycolinamarinprimera.blogspot.comEl Siglo de Torre√≥n ‚Äì N√©stor Mesta Ch√°yres Biography on elsiglodetorreon.comTodo Tango ‚Äì Juan Arvizu Biography of Juan Arvizu by Nestor Pinson on todotango.com The brother of Aida Cuevas, \\"the Queen of the Ranchera,\\" Carlos Cuevas has been equally successful as an interpreter of the bolero. =Romantic ballad or Latin ballad= Luis Miguel, \\"El sol de Mexico\\" (The Sun of Mexico). His album 33, which featured a collection of ballads and uptempo songs climbed to number 1 on Billboard's Latin Charts earning Luis Miguel two Billboard Awards as well as Grammy and Latin Grammy award nominations. The Latin or romantic balled has its origin in the Latin American bolero in the 1950s (Lucho Kitten, Leo Marini), but also in the romantic song in Italian (Nicola Di Bari) and French (Charles Aznavour) in the 1960s and 1970s. The ethnomusicologist Daniel Party defines the romantic ballad as \\"a love song of slow tempo, played by a solo singer accompanied by an orchestra usually\\". On September 28, 2010, Cristian Castro released the single \\"La Nave del Olvido\\" and \\"Amor, Amor\\" as part of Viva el Pr√≠ncipe, his tribute album to Jos√© Jos√©.CRISTIAN CASTRO ESTRENA NUEVO √ÅLBUM Universal Music Latin Entertainment The ballad and bolero are often confused and songs can fall in one or the other category without too much presicion. The distinction between them is referring primarily to a more sophisticated and more metaphorical language and subtle bolero, compared with a more direct expression of the ballad. In Mexico, the first ballad that is registered as such is \\"Sonata de Amor\\" (Sonata of Love) of Mario Alvarez in 1961. In 1965, bolero singer-songwriter Armando Manzanero recorded his first ballad, \\"Pobres besos m√≠os\\" (My Poor Kisses). The heyday of the ballad was reached in the mid-1970s, where artists such as Jos√© Jos√©, Camilo Sesto, Raphael, Roberto Carlos, Roc√≠o D√∫rcal and others released many hits. The main hist of Jos√© Jos√© were \\"El triste\\" (The Sad One) by Roberto Cantoral, \\"La nave del olvido\\" (The ship of the forgotten), \\"Te extra√±o\\" (I Miss You), \\"Amar y querer\\" (Love and want), or \\"Gavil√°n o Paloma\\" (Hawk or Dove), \\"Lo Pasado Pasado\\" (The Past is Past), \\"Volc√°n\\" (Volcano) or \\"Lo que no fue no ser√°\\" (What Never Was Will Never Be). In the course of their existence the genre merged with diverse rhythms to form several variants, such as romantic salsa and cumbia aside others. Manolo Mu√±oz was one of the first soloists in Latin America to sing romantic ballads, V√≠ctor Yturbe considered as one of the best interpreters of this genre in Mexico and Lupita D'Alessio is one of the great female singers in the ballad genre of the '80s in Latin America. From the 1990s on, globalization and media internationalization contributed to the ballad's international spread and homogenization. Tropical Sonora Santanera is an orchestra playing tropical music from Mexico with over 60 years of history. =Cumbia= Pi√±a was a pioneer in the mixture and fusion of tropical sounds. The history of Cumbia in Mexico is almost as old as Cumbia in Colombia. In the 1940s Colombian singers emigrated to Mexico, where they worked with the Mexican orquestra director Rafael de Paz. In the 1950s they recorded what many people consider to be the first cumbia recorded outside of Colombia, La Cumbia Cienaguera. He recorded other hits like Mi gallo tuerto, Caprichito, and Nochebuena. This is when Cumbia began to become popular Mexico, with Tony Camargo as one of the first exponents of Mexican Cumbia. In Mexico D.F., most people who dance to it are called \\"Chilangos\\"‚Äîwhich means people born in the main district. In the 1970s Aniceto Molina emigrated to Mexico, where he joined the group from Guerrero, La Luz Roja de San Marcos, and recorded many popular tropical cumbias like El Gallo Mojado, El Peluquero, and La Mariscada. Also in the 70s Rigo Tovar became very popular with his fusion of Cumbia with ballad and Rock. Today Cumbia is played in many different ways, and has slight variations depending on the geographical area like Cumbia sonidera, Cumbia andina mexicana, Cumbia Norte√±a, Tecno-cumbia. Popular Mexican Cumbia composers and interpreters include Rigo Tovar y su Costa Azul, Celso Pi√±a, Ninel Conde, Los Caminantes, Grupo Bronco, and Selena. Los √Ångeles Azules play the cumbia sonidera genre, which is a cumbia subgenre using the accordion and synthesizers. This results in a fusion of the sounds of cumbia from the 1950-1970s with those of 1990s-style electronic music.Los √Ångeles Azules: Artist biography by Drago Bonacich\\", AllMusic Art music =Operas= √Ångela Peralta operatic soprano The first opera by a Mexican-born composer was Manuel de Zumaya's La Part√©nope, performed in 1711 before a private audience in the Viceroy's Palace in Mexico City. However, the first Mexican composer to have his operas publicly staged was Manuel Arenzana, the maestro de capilla at Puebla Cathedral from 1792 to 1821.Tiemastra, Suzanne Spicer, The choral music of Latin America: a guide to compositions and research, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1992, p. 8. He is known to have written at least two works performed during the 1805/1806 season at the Teatro Coliseo in Mexico City ‚Äî El extrangero and Los dos ribales en amore. Both were short comic pieces. The first Mexican opera seria was Paniagua's Catalina de Guisa (composed in 1845 and premiered in 1859). With its story about the Huguenots in France and an Italian libretto by Felice Romani, contemporary critics noted that the only thing Mexican about it was the composer.Grout, Donald Jay and Williams, Hermine Weigel, A short history of opera, Columbia University Press, 2003, p. 561.

Bicentennial Voices) Angel Ruz, Leticia de Altamirano, patricia santos, Linda Guti√©rrez and Alan Pingarron Although the traditions of European opera and especially Italian opera had initially dominated the Mexican music conservatory and strongly influenced native opera composers (in both style and subject matter), elements of Mexican nationalism had already appeared by the latter part of the 19th century with operas such as Aniceto Ortega del Villar's 1871 Guatimotzin, a romanticised account of the defense of Mexico by its last Aztec ruler, Cuauht√©moc. Later works such as Miguel Bernal Jim√©nez's 1941 Tata Vasco (based on the life of Vasco de Quiroga, the first bishop of Michoac√°n) incorporated native melodies into the score. √Ångela Peralta was an operatic soprano of international fame, known in Europe as \\"The Mexican Nightingale\\", who sang in the premieres of operas by Paniagua, Morales, and Ortega del Villar. Mexican tenors include Rolando Villazon, Ram√≥n Vargas, Francisco Araiza, Arturo Chac√≥n Cruz, Fernando de la Mora, Javier Camarena, Jos√© Mojica, Jos√© Sosa Esquivel, and Alfonso Ortiz Tirado. Mexican soprano include Marta Domingo, Maria Katzarava, Irma Gonz√°lez, Olivia Gorra, Irasema Terrazas, and singer Susana Zabaleta. Spanish opera singer, conductor and arts administrator Pl√°cido Domingo (in the 1990s part of The Three Tenors), started his career in Mexico and continued to do charitable work and presentations in Mexico. =Classical= Silvestre Revueltas Mexico has a long tradition of classical music, as far back as the 16th century, when it was a Spanish colony. Music of New Spain, especially that of Juan Guti√©rrez de Padilla and Hernando Franco, is increasingly recognized as a significant contribution to New World culture. OFUNAM playing at Sala Nezahualc√≥yotl (Room Nezahualcoyotl). Puebla was a significant center of music composition in the 17th century, as the city had considerable wealth and for a time was presided over by Bishop Juan de Palafox y Mendoza, who was an enthusiastic patron of music. Composers during this period included Bernardo de Peralta Escudero (mostly active around 1640), and also Juan Guti√©rrez de Padilla, who was the most famous composer of the 17th century in Mexico. The construction of the cathedral in Puebla made the composition and performance of polychoral music possible, especially compositions in the Venetian polychoral style. Late in the century, Miguel Matheo de Dallo y Lana set the verse of poet Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz. In the 18th century, Manuel de Sumaya, maestro de capilla at the cathedral in Mexico City, wrote many cantadas and villancicos, and he was the first Mexican to compose an opera, La Partenope (1711). After him, Ignacio Jerusalem, an Italian-born composer, brought some of the latest operatic styles as well as early classical (galant) styles to Mexico. His best-known composition is probably the Matins for the Virgin of Guadalupe (1764). Jerusalem was maestro de capilla at the cathedral in Mexico City after Sumaya, from 1749 until his death in 1769. In the 19th century the waltzes of Juventino Rosas achieved world recognition. Manuel M. Ponce is recognized as an important composer for the Spanish classical guitar, responsible for widening the repertoire for this instrument. Ponce also wrote a rich repertoire for solo piano, piano and ensembles, and piano and orchestra, developing the first period of modernistic nationalism, using Native American and European resources, but merging them into a new, original style. Jalisco Symphony Orchestra. In the 20th century, Carlos Ch√°vez, is a notable composer who wrote symphonies, ballets, and a wide catalog of chamber music, within varied esthetic orientations. Another recognized composer is Silvestre Revueltas who wrote such pieces as The night of the mayas, an homage to Garc√≠a Lorca (tribute to Garc√≠a Lorca), Sensemay√° based on a poem by Nicol√°s Guill√©n, and orchestral suites like Janitzio and Redes originally written for motion pictures. Jos√© Pablo Moncayo with compositions such as Huapango, and Blas Galindo with Sones de Mariachi, are also recognized as adapters of Mexican sons into symphonic music. A later contributor to this tradition, Arturo M√°rquez is also internationally known by his orchestral mastery and melodic vivacity like Danz√≥n No. 2. Cuarteto Latinoamericano is a renowned string quartet, formed in Mexico in 1981. In 1922, Juli√°n Carrillo (violinist, composer, conductor, theoretician and inventor), created the first microtonal system in the history of classical music. During subsequent years, he also developed and constructed harps and pianos able to play music in fragments of tone, like fourths, sixths, eighths and sixteenths. His pianos are still manufactured in Germany and are used to play Carrillo's music, mainly in Europe and Mexico. Another contemporary Mexican composer was Conlon Nancarrow (of American birth), who created a system to play pianola music, using and developing theories of politempo and polimetrics. Other noted contemporary composer include Benjam√≠n Ju√°rez Echenique and Eduardo Diazmu√±oz. Some avant-garde composers leading Mexican music during the second half of the 20th century were Alicia Urreta, Manuel Enr√≠quez, Mario Lavista Juan Antonio Rosado Rodriguez, Julio Estrada and Luc√≠a √Ålvarez. Some of them also contributed to the academic development of music teaching in American universities, a work also enriched by Gabriela Ortiz, Daniel Cat√°n, Carlos Sanchez-Gutierrez, Guillermo Galindo, Carlos Sandoval, Ignacio Baca-Lobera, Hebert V√°zquez, Ricardo Zohn-Muldoon and Samuel Zyman. In the other side of the Atlantic the composers of a new generation,** Javier √Ålvarez, Ana Lara, V√≠ctor Rasgado, Juan Trigos, Hilda Paredes, Javier Torres Maldonado, Gabriel Pareyon, and Georgina Derbez, also have contributed to the academic and artistic life. Alondra de la Parra is also an official cultural ambassador of Mexico. =Jazz= Jaramar sings in the Genre of World Music Some major exponents are Juan Garc√≠a Esquivel, Eugenio Toussaint, Arturo Castro, Rafael M√©ndez, Richard Lemus, Leo Acosta, Tino Contreras, Luis Ocadiz, J. J. Calatayud, Chilo Mor√°n, and Popo S√°nchez. Antonio S√°nchez is also a very well known jazz drummer and composer from Mexico City who has been performing with some of the best known American musicians since he moved to the US in the early 1990s including Pat Metheny, Chick Corea, Michael Brecker and Gary Burton besides leading his own bands and ensembles. Arturo O'Farrill son of Latin jazz musician, arranger and bandleader Chico O'Farrill, is known for his contributions to contemporary Latin jazz.

Seven years later he manufactured and sold the first commercially practical television set to the public. In June 1938, his Model 180 television receiver was the first all-electronic television set ever sold to the public, a few months prior to RCA's first set in April 1939. In 1946, DuMont founded the first television network to be licensed, the DuMont Television Network, initially by linking station WABD (named for DuMont; it later became WNEW and is now WNYW) in New York City to station W3XWT, which later became WTTG, in Washington, D.C. (WTTG was named for Dr. Thomas T. Goldsmith, DuMont's Vice President of Research, and his best friend.) DuMont's successes in television picture tubes, TV sets and components and his involvement in commercial TV broadcasting made him the first millionaire in the business. Biography =Early life= DuMont was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Lillian Felton (Balcom) and William Henry Beaman DuMont. At the age of 10, he was stricken with polio and was quarantined at his family's Eastern Parkway apartment for nearly a year. During his quarantine, his father brought home books and magazines for the young DuMont to read while bedridden. At this time, DuMont developed an interest in science, specifically wireless radio communication, and taught himself Morse code. His father bought him a crystal radio receiver, which he assembled, took apart, reassembled and rebuilt several times. He improved his set each time he rebuilt it and later built a transmitter, while his father obtained the landlord's permission to erect a transceiving antenna on the roof. While recuperating from polio, DuMont was advised to swim to regain the use of his legs. In 1914, the family moved to Montclair, New Jersey, where there was an indoor year-round pool available at the local YMCA. He graduated from Montclair High School in 1919, and went to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, where he was part of the Alpha Chapter of the Theta Xi fraternity. =Radio and early interest in television= In 1915, DuMont became the youngest American to obtain a first class commercial radio operator's license at age 14. The following summer, he worked as a radio operator aboard a coastal steamer making runs from New York to Providence, Rhode Island. As the summers went by, he made his way to the Caribbean, South America and, after World War I, to Europe, where, during the summer of 1922, he was stuck in Copenhagen for months because of a dock workers' strike. After graduating from Rensselaer in 1924, DuMont worked at the Westinghouse Lamp Company in Bloomfield, New Jersey, in charge of radio tube production. While there, he increased production from 500 tubes per day to an astounding 50,000 tubes per day. Management decided to give him a $500 bonus, a small raise, and the \\"Westinghouse Award\\", an award devised to recognize his accomplishments. The \\"Westinghouse Award\\" was later presented as a scholarship award to high school seniors showing promise in a field of science (later the Intel Science Talent Search) and continues to this day as the Regeneron Science Talent Search). By 1928, DuMont was searching for new opportunities and was wooed by Dr. Lee De Forest, a radio pioneer who developed the audion tube, the original voice amplifier for radio reception. De Forest had a checkered career as an inventor and had several failed business ventures. DuMont was hired as vice president and production manager for radio tubes. He revamped the factory with newly designed machinery: \\"a high speed sealing machine, automatic grid winding and welding machine, base branding machine, basing and wire cutting machine, high-frequency bombarder and numerous tube-characteristic test sets and life racks.\\"1946 Current Biography Yearbook Factory capacity was increased to 30,000 tubes per day. When De Forest took over the mechanical television system of C. Francis Jenkins, DuMont turned his attention to television. He was involved in the first television transmissions from W2XCD in Passaic. But DuMont realized that clear images would need the development of scanning in a cathode ray tube. DuMont worked to improve television transmission and reception and went to De Forest asking for funds to build a long-lasting cathode ray tube for television reception. De Forest denied DuMont's request as De Forest's investors were demanding better returns. Subsequently, DuMont resigned at the same time that De Forest sold his radio manufacturing business to David Sarnoff at RCA. =Cathode ray tube (CRT) and oscillograph= DuMont 164 Oscillograph (1939-40), an early general purpose oscillograph DuMont had developed an improved version of the cathode ray tube which was both cheaper to produce and was longer-lasting than the German tubes used at that time; the imported tubes had a life of 25 to 30 hours. DuMont's invention of the first long-lasting cathode ray tube would later make commercially viable television possible. He started his own company, Allen B. DuMont Laboratories, in the basement of his Upper Montclair home, building long-lasting cathode ray tubes. In 1931, he sold two tubes to two college science laboratories for $35 each. Since DuMont was a leader in cathode ray tube or CRT design and manufacturing, it was a natural step to use the CRT as a visual measuring instrument or oscilloscope. The production of CRT's and oscilloscopes was part of DuMont Laboratories located in Upper Montclair, NJ. Needing more space he moved to a larger location in Passaic, NJ in 1934. Although not the inventor of the oscilloscope, DuMont designed and mass-produced practical oscilloscopes (he called them oscillographs) for all types of laboratory, automotive/equipment servicing and manufacturing applications. By the 1940s DuMont was the leader in the oscilloscope equipment market. DuMont was one of the earliest designers of the trigger sweep oscilloscope using a gas thyratron vacuum tube (forerunner to the silicon controlled rectifier or SCR). This allowed the oscilloscope to show a visual trace at a preset input signal level. In addition the sweep (trace across the CRT screen) could be regulated by the sweep speed or sweep frequency. This design allowed the oscilloscope to provide better visual detail of the measurement being studied. The trigger was a frequency synchronizing type which provided stability in viewing. The profits from the oscillographs helped him invest in television design and his DuMont TV Network. Unfortunately the time spent on his TV ventures proved to be the end of his profitable oscillograph business. In 1947 a young equipment manufacturer called Tektronix produced the model 511 Time Base Trigger and Sweep Oscilloscope for $795. The use of time instead of frequency to measure a sweep across the CRT was Tektronix's big selling point. Time measurements are easier to interpret pulses and complex waveforms. It has been mentioned informally that Allen DuMont saw the model 511 demonstrated at an electronics show. He tried it and was impressed, but commented to Howard Vollum and Jack Murdock, co-founders of Tektronix that it was too expensive and they would be lucky to sell any. Tektronix's time base trigger and time sweep generator design would become the standard in the 1950s and into the 21st century. Tektronix would replace DuMont Oscillographs as the leading selling oscilloscope brand. When Fairchild Camera and Instrument acquired DuMont Laboratories in 1960, oscilloscopes were still being made with the DuMont name brand. Allen DuMont became Group General Manager of the DuMont Division, until his death in 1965. All DuMont oscilloscopes in the late 1950s and after the Fairchild acquisition were using the time base trigger and time sweep generator method introduced by Tektronix. The DuMont line of oscilloscopes continued to be produced into the 1980s. During the early years of World War II, DuMont received special government contracts to provide large wide cathode ray tubes. These special tubes allowed scientists working on the Manhattan Project to study the action of accelerated electrons. = Other achievements = In 1932, DuMont proposed a \\"ship finder\\" device to the United States Army Signal Corps at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, that used radio wave distortions to locate objects on a cathode ray tube screen, a type of radar. The military asked him, however, not to take out a patent for developing what they wanted to maintain as a secret, and so he is not often mentioned among those responsible for radar. Mission Bell Model 410 radio. (green glow) In 1932 DuMont invented the magic eye tube also known as the Electron Ray Tube,David Weinstein, The Forgotten Network: DuMont and the Birth of American Television. Temple University Press, 2006, p.11 used as a tuning accessory in radios and as a level meter in mono and stereo home reel-to-reel tape recorders. In the 1930s the manufacture of mechanical panel meters were labor-intensive and expensive. Magic eye tubes provided radio designers with a less expensive and more profitable way to add a feature usually found in higher price equipment. The general public reception was a success as customers like the green glow and the seemingly magical way it worked. He released information on his invention the following year. He sold the patents and rights to RCA for $20,000 to help fund his other projects. DuMont produced black and white televisions in the late 1930s, 1940s and 1950s that were generally regarded as offering highest quality and durability. Many of these premium sets included a built in AM/FM radio and record player.See a video of a 1949 DuMont Television Commercial at this link: . DuMont sold his television manufacturing division to Emerson Radio in 1958, and sold the remainder of the company to Fairchild Camera in 1960. Fairchild later developed semiconductor microchips. Robert Noyce, a co-founder of Intel, originally worked for DuMont as an engineer. DuMont Television Network The DuMont Television Network was not an unqualified success, being faced with the major problem of how to make a profit without the benefit of an already established radio network as a base. After ten years, DuMont shuttered the network and sold what remained of his television operations to John Kluge in 1956, which Kluge renamed Metromedia. DuMont's partner, Thomas T. Goldsmith (for whom the Washington, D.C. station WTTG was named), remained on Metromedia's board of directors from this time all the way until Kluge sold the stations to the Fox Television Stations Group in 1986, when the Fox network was formed. Awards, family and later life DuMont was the first to provide funding for educational television broadcasting. He was the recipient of numerous honorary degrees and awards, among them the Cross of Knight awarded by the French Government, the Horatio Alger Award, the Westinghouse Award, and the DeForest Medal. He is also a holder of over 30 patents in cathode ray tubes and other television equipment. DuMont enjoyed sailing. He owned a cruiser, the Hurricane III. He would participate in boat races and compete in navigation skills competition, winning three national championships. He died in 1965 and is buried in Mount Hebron Cemetery in Montclair, New Jersey. He was survived by his wife Ethel and their two children, Allen Jr. and Yvonne. The television center at Montclair State University bears his name and produces programs for the NJTV system (formerly New Jersey Network).

Oars have a flat blade at one end. Rowers grasp the oar at the other end. The difference between oars and paddles is that oars are used exclusively for rowing. In rowing the oar is connected to the vessel by means of a pivot point for the oar, either an oarlock, or a thole. The oar is placed in the pivot point with a short portion inside the vessel, and a much larger portion outside. The rower pulls on the short end of oar, while the long end is in the water. The oar is a second class lever with the water as the fulcrum, the oarlock as the load, and the rower as the force, force being applied to the oarlock by exertion of pressure against the water. An oar is an unusual lever since the mechanical advantage is less than one. The oar increases the small displacement of the end held by the rower, into a large displacement of the vessel through the water. The rower applies a large force through a small distance, which must be equaled by the small force the water applies operating over a longer distance, i.e. the work done by the rower must be balanced by the work done by the water. By contrast, paddles, are held in both hands by the paddler, and are not attached to the vessel. Rowers generally face the stern of the vessel, reach towards the stern, and insert the blade of their oar in the water. As they lean back, towards the vessel's bow, the blade of their oars pivots in the oarlock, and the end in the water moves towards the stern, providing forward thrust. For thousands of years vessels were powered either by sails, or by the mechanical work of rowers, or by paddlers. Some ancient vessels were propelled by both oars and sail, depending on the speed and direction of the wind. History Rowing oars have been used since the early Neolithic period. Wooden oars, with canoe-shaped pottery, dating from 5000‚Äì4500 BC have been discovered in a Hemudu culture site at Yuyao, Zhejiang, in modern China.Deng, Gang. (1997). Chinese Maritime Activities and Socioeconomic Development, c. 2100 B.C.-1900 A.D. Westport: Greenwood Press. , p. 22. In 1999, an oar measuring 63.4 cm (2 ft) in length, dating from 4000 BC, was unearthed in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan.The Japan Times. (February 10, 1999). Oldest oar unearthed from Ishikawa ruins. Retrieved on 2008-08-13. Construction Oars have traditionally been made of wood. The form is a long shaft (or loom) with a flat blade on the end. Where the oar connects to the boat there is a \\"collar\\" (or button), often made of leather, which stops the oar slipping past the rowlock. Oars usually have a handle about 150mm long, which may be a material sleeve or alternatively an ovoid shape carved to fit the hands.  Balanced oar This is a normal, usually wooden oar to which weight has been added at the inboard end so that the blade end is noticeably lighter and easier for a rower to operate without fatigue. The two methods of adding weight are to either have a much larger section in the oar immediately next to the handle for a distance of about or to drill an hole inside the handle for a distance of about and add about 12 oz of lead secured by epoxy resin glue. For a oar the balance point is about 12 inches outboard of the rowlock. Often surplus wood is removed from the blade's width and thickness and at the neck between the blade and the shaft to further reduce outboard weight. This type of oar is much better for long-range rowing.  Oars used for transport  The oars used for transport come in a variety of sizes. The oars used in small dinghies or rafts can be less than 2 metres long. In classical times warships were propelled by very long oars that might have several oarsmen per oar. These oars could be more than a dozen metres long.  Oars used for competitive rowing  A pair of carbon fibre sculling oars used for sport rowing Trophy oars of the seven founding member clubs of the Remenham Club The oars used in competitive rowing are long (250‚Äì300 cm) poles with one flat end about 50 cm long and 25 cm wide, called the blade. The part of the oar the oarsman holds while rowing is called the handle. While rowing, the oars are supported by metal frames attached to the side of the boat called riggers, while the oar fits into the oarlocks at the ends of each rigger. Classic oars were made of wood, but modern oars are made from synthetic material, the most common being carbon fibre.  Oars used as trophies  The sport of competitive rowing has developed a tradition of using an oar as a memento of significant race wins. A 'trophy oar' is not presented at the end of the race as a more familiar precious metal cup might be, but rather given by the club, school or university that the winning crew or rower represented. A trophy oar is a competition oar that has been painted in the club colours and has then had the details of the race signwritten on the face of the blade. The most common format would have the coat of arms or crest of the club or school positioned in the centre, with the crew names and the race details arranged around this. Many older universities (Oxford and Cambridge would be prime examples, as well as Yale and Harvard) and their colleges have long histories of using the trophy oar and many examples are on display in club houses around the world. In culture The Norwegian municipalities of Fedje and Her√∏y both have oars in their coat-of-arms. Oars have been used to describe various animals with characteristics that closely resemble the said rowing implement. The members of the Family Regalecidae, elongated deep-sea fishes, are called oarfish because their body shape is similar to that of an oar. The hawksbill turtle's genus of Eretmochelys is derived from the Greek root eretmo, which roughly translates to oar. The turtle was so-named because of the oar-like shape of its front flippers.

It is strongly associated with the Royal Navy, but also used by the British Army.  Original masque  This British national air was originally included in Thomas Arne's Alfred, a masque about Alfred the Great co-written by Thomson and David Mallet and first performed at Cliveden, country home of Frederick, Prince of Wales, on 1 August 1740.Scholes p. 897. Frederick, a German prince who arrived in England as an adult and was on very bad terms with his father, was making considerable efforts to ingratiate himself and build a following among his subjects-to-be (which turned out to be unnecessary as he predeceased his father and never became king). A masque linking the prince with both the medieval hero-king Alfred the Great's victories over the Vikings and the current building of British sea power ‚Äì exemplified by the recent successful capture of Porto Bello from the Spanish by Admiral Vernon on 21 November 1739, avenging in the eyes of the British public Admiral Hosier's disastrous Blockade of Porto Bello of 1726‚Äì27 ‚Äì went well with his political plans and aspirations. Thomson was a Scottish poet and playwright, who spent most of his adult life in England and hoped to make his fortune at Court. He had an interest in helping foster a British identity, including and transcending the older English, Irish, Welsh and Scottish identities. Thomson had written The Tragedy of Sophonisba (1730), based on the historical figure of Sophonisba ‚Äì a proud princess of Carthage, a major sea-power of the ancient world, who had committed suicide rather than submit to slavery at the hands of the Romans. Many British people were also enslaved by Barbary pirates operating from North Africa during this period. This might have some bearing on the song's famous refrain \\"Britons never will be slaves!\\". Incidentally, Thomson wrote the word \\"never\\" only once, but it has been popularly corrupted to \\"never, never, never\\", possibly because it is actually easier to sing. The same theme was repeated in the Navy's own \\"Heart of Oak\\", written two decades later: To honour we call you, as freemen not slaves/For who are so free as the sons of the waves?. In 1751 Mallet altered the lyrics, omitting three of the original six stanzas and adding three others, written by Lord Bolingbroke. This version known as \\"Married to a Mermaid\\" became extremely popular when Mallet produced his masque of Britannia at Drury Lane Theatre in 1755.  Original lyrics  This version is taken from The Works of James Thomson by James Thomson, Published 1763, Vol II, p. 191, which includes the entire original text of Alfred.  Symbolism  The song soon developed an independent life of its own, separate from the masque of which it had formed a part. First heard in London in 1745, it achieved instant popularity. It quickly became so well known that Handel quoted it in his Occasional Oratorio in the following year. Handel used the first phrase as part of the Act II soprano aria, \\"Prophetic visions strike my eye\\", when the soprano sings it at the words \\"War shall cease, welcome peace!\\"Scholes p. 898 Similarly, \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" was seized upon by the Jacobites, who altered Thomson's words to a pro-Jacobite version. \\"when royal Charles by Heaven's command, arrived in Scotland's noble Plain, etc\\" However, Thomson's original words remained best-known. Their denunciation of \\"foreign tyrants\\" [\\"haughty tyrants\\"?] has some foundation as the Glorious Revolution had decisively curbed royal prerogative, leading to the Bill of Rights of 1689 and it was on the way to developing its constitutional monarchy, in marked contrast to the Royal Absolutism still prevalent in Europe. Britain and France were at war for much of the century and hostile in between (see \\"Second Hundred Years' War\\") and the French Bourbons were undoubtedly the prime example of \\"haughty tyrants\\", whose \\"slaves\\" Britons should never be. According to Armitage \\"Rule, Britannia\\" was the most lasting expression of the conception of Britain and the British Empire that emerged in the 1730s, \\"predicated on a mixture of adulterated mercantilism, nationalistic anxiety and libertarian fervour\\". He equates the song with Bolingbroke's On the Idea of a Patriot King (1738), also written for the private circle of Frederick, Prince of Wales, in which Bolingbroke had \\"raised the spectre of permanent standing armies that might be turned against the British people rather than their enemies\\".Armitage, p.185 Hence British naval power could be equated with civil liberty, since an island nation with a strong navy to defend it could afford to dispense with a standing army which, since the time of Cromwell, was seen as a threat and a source of tyranny. At the time it appeared, the song was not a celebration of an existing state of naval affairs, but an exhortation. Although the Dutch Republic, which in the 17th century presented a major challenge to English sea power, was obviously past its peak by 1745, Britain did not yet \\"rule the waves\\", although, since it was written during the War of Jenkins' Ear, it could be argued that the words referred to the alleged Spanish aggression against British merchant vessels that caused the war. The time was still to come when the Royal Navy would be an unchallenged dominant force on the oceans. The jesting lyrics of the mid-18th century would assume a material and patriotic significance by the end of the 19th century. Britannia rule the waves: decorated plate made in Liverpool circa 1793‚Äì1794 (Mus√©e de la R√©volution fran√ßaise). \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" is often written as simply \\"Rule Britannia\\", omitting both the comma and the exclamation mark, which changes the interpretation of the lyric by altering the punctuation. Richard Dawkins recounts in The Selfish Gene that the repeated exclamation \\"Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves!\\" is often rendered as \\"Rule, Britannia! Britannia rules the waves!\\", changing the meaning of the verse. This addition of a terminal 's' to the lyrics is used as an example of a successful meme. Maurice Willson Disher notes that the change from \\"Britannia, rule the waves\\" to \\"Britannia rules the waves\\" occurred in the Victorian era, at a time when the British did rule the waves and no longer needed to be exhorted to rule them. Disher also notes that the Victorians changed \\"will\\" to \\"shall\\" in the line \\"Britons never shall be slaves\\".Disher, Maurice Willson. Victorian Song, Phoenix House, 1955. The song assumed extra significance in 1945 at the conclusion of World War II when it was played at the ceremonial surrender of the Japanese imperial army in Singapore. A massed military band of Australian, British and American forces played as Supreme Allied Commander Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma arrived. \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" (in an orchestral arrangement by Sir Malcolm Sargent) is traditionally performed at the BBC's Last Night of the Proms, normally with a guest soloist (past performers have included Jane Eaglen, Bryn Terfel, Thomas Hampson, Joseph Calleja, and Felicity Lott). It has always been the last part of Sir Henry Wood's Fantasia on British Sea Songs, except that for many years up until 2000, the Sargent arrangement has been used. However, in recent years the inclusion of the song and other patriotic tunes has been much criticised‚Äînotably by Leonard Slatkin‚Äîand the presentation has been occasionally amended. For some years the performance at the Last Night of the Proms reverted to Sir Henry Wood's original arrangement. When Bryn Terfel performed it at the Proms in 1994 and 2008 he sang the third verse in Welsh. The text is available at Rule Britannia .  Musical derivations  Arne's tune has been used by, or at least quoted by, a great many composers of which the following are a few examples. The melody was the theme for a set of variations for piano by Ludwig van Beethoven (WoO 79)Scholes (p. 898) says \\"Beethoven wrote piano variations on the tune (poor ones), and many composers who were no Beethovens have done the like\\". and he also used it in \\"Wellington's Victory\\", Op. 91, and in extracted and varied form in the second movement of his Piano Sonata No. 24, Op. 78, \\"√Ä Th√©r√®se\\". Richard Wagner wrote a concert overture in D major based on the theme in 1837 (WWV 42). He subsequently made it the basis of his \\"Gro√üe Sonata\\" for piano, Op. 4. Ferdinand Ries quotes from it in \\"The Dream\\" (also known as \\"Il sogno\\") for piano, Op. 49, and wrote Variations on Rule Britannia for orchestra, Op. 116. Johann Strauss I quoted the song in full as the introduction to his 1838 waltz \\"Huldigung der K√∂nigin Victoria von Grossbritannien\\" (Homage to Queen Victoria of Great Britain), Op. 103, where he also quotes the British national anthem \\"God Save the Queen\\" at the end of the piece. The French organist-composer Alexandre Guilmant included this tune in his Fantaisie sur deux m√©lodies anglaises for organ Op. 43, where he also makes use of the song \\"Home! Sweet Home!\\". Arthur Sullivan, perhaps Britain's most popular composer during the reign of Queen Victoria, quoted from \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" on at least three occasions in music for his comic operas written with W. S. Gilbert and Bolton Rowe. In Utopia Limited, Sullivan used airs from \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" to highlight references to Great Britain. In The Zoo (written with Rowe) Sullivan applied the tune of \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" to an instance in which Rowe's libretto quotes directly from the patriotic march. Finally, to celebrate the jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887, Sullivan added a chorus of \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" to the finale of HMS Pinafore, which was playing in revival at the Savoy Theatre. Sullivan also quoted the tune in his 1897 ballet Victoria and Merrie England, which traced the \\"history\\" of England from the time of the Druids up to Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, an event the ballet was meant to celebrate. The part of the tune's refrain on the word \\"never\\" (often corrupted to \\"never, never, never\\"), is among those claimed to have provided the theme on which Edward Elgar's Enigma Variations are based. Elgar also quotes the opening phrase of \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" in his 1912 choral work The Music Makers, based on Arthur O'Shaughnessy's Ode at the line \\"We fashion an empire's glory\\", where he also quotes \\"La Marseillaise\\". Noel Coward begins the song \\"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\\" with the first 10 notes of \\"Rule Britannia\\". Stan Freberg used the first 10 notes of \\"Rule Britannia\\" a couple of times in his 1961 album History of the America: The Early Years. In the 1963 film It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, the Algernon theme quotes the chorus of \\"Rule Britannia\\".  References   Bibliography  *Thomas Augustine Arne: Alfred. Musica Britannica vol.

He accompanied his father in travels through Germany, Poland, and Bohemia. After his return to England he was placed at Westminster School, on 3 May 1592, under the tuition of Edward Grant and Camden. Anthony Wood was informed that he subsequently studied at Oxford, but he took no degree and it is not known which college he attended. Medicine Settling in London with the intention of practising \\"physic\\" (medicine), he exhibited at the door of his house a list of medicines which were said to be certain cures for many diseases. The censors of the College of Physicians summoned him to appear before them, but it is not known what the outcome was.

Through the recommendation of James I he was appointed one of the physicians to the Tsar Michael I of Russia. He remained in Russia for about 14 years, principally in Moscow. There he wrote his Fasciculus Chemicus, a collection of writings on alchemy. Returning to England on the death of his wife in 1637, Dee became physician to King Charles I.

Flora of China. species of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world. Description European goldenrod is pollinated by Bombus cryptarum Solidago species are perennials growing from woody caudices or rhizomes. Their stems range from decumbent (crawling) to ascending or erect, with a range of heights going from to over a meter. Most species are unbranched, but some do display branching in the upper part of the plant. Both leaves and stems vary from glabrous (hairless) to various forms of pubescence (strigose, strigillose, hispid, stipitate-glandular or villous). In some species, the basal leaves are shed before flowering. The leaf margins are most commonly entire, but often display heavier serration. Some leaves may display trinerved venation rather than the pinnate venation usual across Asteraceae. The flower heads are usually of the radiate type (typical daisy flower heads with distinct ray and disc florets) but sometimes discoid (with only disc florets of mixed, sterile, male and bisexual types). Only ray florets are female, others are male, hermaphroditic or entire sterile. Head involucres are campanulate to cylindric or attenuate. Floret corollas are usually yellow, but white in the ray florets of a few species (such as Solidago bicolor); they are typically hairless. Heads usually include between 2 and 35 disc florets, but in some species this may go up to 60. Filaments are inserted closer to the base of the corolla than its middle. Numerous heads are usually grouped in complex compound inflorescences where heads are arranged in multiple racemes, panicles, corymbs, or secund arrays (with florets all on the same side). Solidago cypselae are narrowly obconic to cylindrical in shape, and they are sometimes somewhat compressed. They have eight to 10 ribs usually and are hairless or moderately hispid. The Pappus is very big with barbellate bristles. Goldenrod and visiting Cerceris wasp The many goldenrod species can be difficult to distinguish, due to their similar bright, golden-yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer. Propagation is by wind-disseminated seeds or by spreading underground rhizomes which can form colonies of vegetative clones of a single plant. They are mostly short-day plants and bloom in late summer and early fall. Some species produce abundant nectar when moisture is plentiful, or when the weather is warm and sunny. The section Ptarmicoidei is sometimes treated as a separate genus Oligoneuron, and is distinguished by flat-topped to rounded corymbiform flowerheads. Taxonomy Solidago is in the family Asteraceae (also known as Compositae), a diverse and widespread clade containing approximately 23,000 species and 12 tribes, which inhabit all continents except Antarctica. Within Asteraceae, Solidago is in the tribe Astereae and the subtribe Solidagininaeae. The genus Solidago is monophyletic as indicated by morphological characters and molecular evidence. All Solidago species are herbaceous perennials, growing from approximately 2-cm to 2.5-m tall. Yellow to white, pistillate ray flowers and yellow, perfect disc florets are characteristic of Solidago inflorescences, which have a wide range of shapes. Molecular studies using nuclear rDNA have hypothesized boundaries on the genus Solidago, but there have been difficulties in parsing out evolutionary relationships at the sub-genus scale, and defining which should be included and separated from Solidago. =Solidago and related taxa= Related Asteraceae genera such as Chrysoma, Euthamia, and Oreochrysum have been included within Solidago at one point or another, but morphological evidence has suggested otherwise. In a study comparing morphological characters of Solidago and related subgroups, the authors consider the subjectivity of classifying a genus, and how to define it within broader tendencies concerning the taxonomy of North American Asteraceae. Little to no differences were observed between Solidago and the subgroups in terms of karyotype. However, external morphological characters such as habit, or the general appearance of the plant and how a suite of traits contribute to its phenotype; pappus size; and the point of freeing of stamen filaments from the corolla tube, are useful classification schemes for Solidago, since they are applied to differentiating between Asteraceae taxa. While one school of Asteraceae taxonomy thought unites all taxa sharing similar floral head structure and subsequently ignores deviation from this morphology; while another places greater weight on these morphological deviations. The authors argue that the latter opinion should be applied. Since there is no theoretical foundation for relative taxonomic importance of traits, they assert that habit should be a central trait when defining taxa, and subsequently that all the subgroups considered in their study (Brachychaeta, Chrysoma, Euthamia, Oligoneuron, and Petradoria) should be segregated from Solidago. Results from a leaf anatomy study comparing differences in mesophyll, bundle sheath extensions, and midvein structure, among others in a suite of leaf traits, are incongruent with those in an earlier study. Based on the lack of bundle sheath extensions, it is suggested that Chrysoma, Euthamia, Gundlachia, and Petradoria should be distinct taxa and outside of Solidago. However, Brachychaeta, Brintonia, Oligoneuron, Oreochrysum, and Aster should be considered as components of Solidago. To summarize, the relation of Brachychaeta and Oligoneuron to Solidago is inconsistent based on these results. Both support the separation of Chrysoma, Euthamia, and Petradoria from Solidago. A study reviews the taxonomic position of Oligoneuron relative to Solidago, as based on taxonomic evidence, treats it as separate from Solidago, similarly to Kapoor & Beaudry (1966). The first molecular phylogeny based on chloroplast DNA, treats Brachychaeta, Brintonia, Oligoneuron, and Oreochrysum as constituents of Solidago. Using consensus trees from ITS data, another study found support for Oligoneuron as part of Solidago, and the findings of Zhang (1996). More recently, an analysis of combined ITS and ETS data provided additional support for the inclusion of Oligoneuron as part of Solidago. Until the 1980s, the genus Euthamia was largely considered to be a part of the Solidago due to morphological similarities between species in both genera, and a history of synonymy of Solidago lanceolata and Euthamia graminifolia. As mentioned, the lack of bundle sheath extensions in Euthamia compared to Solidago, and deviations in floral morphology present evidence for separation of these taxa. A taxonomy of Euthamia as a genus was presented, providing a detailed description of distinguishing external morphological characters, such as fibrous-roots, sessile leaves, and mostly corymbiform inflorescences. =Evolutionary relationships within Solidago= Chromosome counts and advances in molecular systematics have enabled greater understanding of evolutionary relationships within Solidago. At the time a taxonomy of Solidago was published, related taxa causing contention, such as Chrysoma, Euthamia, Oligoneuron, and Petradoria were excluded from this genus. The number of Solidago species has remained relatively stable, around 120 species, with approximately 80 in North America. Due to monophyletic support for the New World taxa and taxonomic difficulties with Old World taxa, the taxonomy provided in the 1990s only includes North American taxa and thus treats Solidago as non-monophyletic. Existing molecular-based phylogenies provide monophyletic support for Solidago, given its inclusion of Oligoneuron. Chromosome counts have proven to be a valuable character in Solidago taxonomy and in elucidating the cytogeographic history of Solidago. Similar chromosome counts may indicate close evolutionary relationships while different chromosome numbers may suggest distant relationships through reproductive isolation. Chromosome counts have been studied extensively in North America; all Solidago species have a base chromosome number of x=9, but the following ploidy levels have been observed: 2x, 3x, 4x, 6x, 8x, 10x, 12x, and 14x. Though negligible differences in karyotype among Solidago and related genera were found, Solidago taxa with multiple cytotypes are more common than those with one. Although chromosome count is a useful metric for differentiating among Solidago taxa, it may be problematic due to the frequent variation in ploidy levels. Cytogeographic patterns in the Solidago gigantea complex, with tetraploids occurring in eastern North America and hexaploids in Oregon and Washington were observed. Cytogeographic patterns are also observed in the Solidago canadensis complex; hexaploids within S. canadensis have been observed east of the Great Plains and are treated as Solidago altissima, and diploids and tetraploids occurring in the Great Plains are treated as Solidago gilvocanescens. The taxonomic status of Solidago ptarmicoidei created an extensive debate due to frequency hybridization of S. ptarmicoidei with members of the Ptarmicoidei section of Solidago. It was asserted that S. ptarmicoides should be united with Solidago rather than the genus Aster due to external morphological features such as similar pappus length as well as the same chromosome base (x=9). Information about chromosome number is still a crucial part of current understanding and phylogenies of Soldiago. Use and cultivation Young goldenrod leaves are edible.Solidago missouriensis, Missouri goldenrod. Northern Rockies Natural History Guide. University of Montana, Missoula. Native Americans used the seeds of some species for food.Solidago nemoralis. Native American Ethnobotany. University of Michigan, Dearborn. Herbal teas are sometimes made with goldenrod.Goldenrod. Complementary and Alternative Medicine Guide. University of Maryland Medical Center. Goldenrod often is inaccurately said to cause hay fever in humans. The pollen causing this allergic reaction is produced mainly by ragweed (Ambrosia sp.), blooming at the same time as the goldenrod and pollinated by wind. Goldenrod pollen is too heavy and sticky to be blown far from the flowers, and is pollinated mainly by insects. Frequent handling of goldenrod and other flowers, however, can cause allergic reactions, sometimes irritating enough to force florists to change occupation. Goldenrods are attractive sources of nectar for bees, flies, wasps, and butterflies. Honey from goldenrods often is dark and strong because of admixtures of other nectars. However, when honey flow is strong, a light (often water-clear), spicy-tasting monofloral honey is produced. While the bees are ripening the honey produced from goldenrods, it has a rank odor and taste; the finished honey is much milder. Goldenrods are, in some places, considered a sign of good luck or good fortune. They are considered weeds by many in North America, but they are prized as garden plants in Europe, where British gardeners adopted goldenrod as a garden subject long before Americans did. Goldenrod began to gain some acceptance in American gardening (other than wildflower gardening) during the 1980s. They have become invasive species in other parts of the world, including China; Solidago canadensis, which was introduced as a garden plant in Central Europe, has become common in the wild, and in Germany is considered an invasive species that displaces native vegetation from its natural habitat. Goldenrod species are used as a food source by the larvae of many Lepidoptera species. The invading larva may induce the plant to form a bulbous tissue mass called a gall around it, upon which the larva then feeds. Various parasitoid wasps find these galls and lay eggs in the larvae, penetrating the bulb with their ovipositors. Woodpeckers are known to peck open the galls and eat the insects in the center. =Cultivated species= Cultivated goldenrods include S. bicolor, S. caesia, S. canadensis, S. cutleri, S. riddellii, S. rigida, S. shortii, and S. virgaurea. A number of cultivars have been selected, including several of hybrid origin. A putative hybrid with aster, known as √óSolidaster is less unruly, with pale yellow flowers, equally suitable for dried arrangements. Molecular and other evidence points to √óSolidaster (at least the cultivar 'Lemore') being a hybrid of Solidago ptarmicoides and Solidago canadensis, the former now in Solidago, but likely the \\"aster\\" in question. The cultivars 'Goldenmosa' and S. √ó luteus 'Lemore' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. =Industrial use= Inventor Thomas Edison experimented with goldenrod to produce rubber, which it contains naturally. Edison created a fertilization and cultivation process to maximize the rubber content in each plant. His experiments produced a plant that yielded as much as 12% rubber. The tires on the Model T given to him by his friend Henry Ford were made from goldenrod. Like George Washington Carver, Henry Ford was deeply interested in the regenerative properties of soil and the potential of alternative crops such as peanuts and soybeans to produce plastics, paint, fuel and other products. Ford had long believed that the world would eventually need a substitute for gasoline, and supported the production of ethanol (or grain alcohol) as an alternative fuel. In 1942, he would showcase a car with a lightweight plastic body made from soybeans. Ford and Carver began corresponding via letter in 1934, and their mutual admiration deepened after George Washington Carver made a visit to Michigan in 1937. As Douglas Brinkley writes in \\"Wheels for the World,\\" his history of Ford, the automaker donated generously to the Tuskegee Institute, helping finance Carver's experiments, and Carver in turn spent a period of time helping to oversee crops at the Ford plantation in Ways, Georgia. By the time World War II began, Ford had made repeated journeys to Tuskegee to convince George Washington Carver to come to Dearborn and help him develop a synthetic rubber to help compensate for wartime rubber shortages. Carver arrived on July 19, 1942, and set up a laboratory in an old water works building in Dearborn. He and Ford experimented with different crops, including sweet potatoes and dandelions, eventually devising a way to make the rubber substitute from goldenrod, a plant weed commercially viable. Carver died in January 1943, Ford in April 1947, but the relationship between their two institutions continued to flourish: As recently as the late 1990s, Ford awarded grants of $4 million over two years to the George Washington Carver School at Tuskegee. Extensive process development was conducted during World War II to commercialize goldenrod as a source of rubber. The rubber is only contained in the leaves, not the stems or blooms. Typical rubber content of the leaves is 7%. The resulting rubber is of low molecular weight, resulting in an excessively tacky compound with poor tensile properties. =Traditional medicine= Solidago virgaurea is used in a traditional kidney tonic by practitioners of herbal medicine to counter inflammation and irritation caused by bacterial infections or kidney stones.Campion, K. (1995). Holistic Woman's Herbal - How to Achieve Health and Well-Being at Any Age. Barnes & Noble, Inc. 1995. pp 65 and 96. Goldenrod is also used in some formulas for cleansing of the kidney or bladder during a healing fast, in conjunction with potassium broth and specific juices. Some Native American cultures traditionally chew the leaves to relieve sore throats, and the roots to relieve toothaches. =Medicinal Exploration= In various assessments by the European Medicines Agency with respect to Solidago virgaurea, non-clinical data shows diuretic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic and spasmolytic, antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer and immunomodulatory activity. However, as no single ingredient is responsible for these effects, the whole herbal preparation of Solidago inflorescences must be considered as the active ingredient.European Medicines Agency, ASSESSMENT REPORT ON SOLIDAGO VIRGAUREA L., HERBA, European Medicines Agency Evaluation of Medicines for Human Use London, 4 September 2008 Doc.

Solidago altissima, tall goldenrod, was recently named the state wildflower of South Carolina. The sweet goldenrod (Solidago odora) is the state herb of Delaware.State Seal, Song and Symbols of Delaware Goldenrod was the state flower of Alabama, but it was later rejected in favor of the camellia. In the Midwestern United States, the blooming of goldenrods in August is a reminder that it will soon be time for children to go back to school after summer vacation.

He joined in 1982, replacing Diz Minnitt, while acting occasionally as a backing vocalist and acoustic guitarist. Although he was born in Middlesbrough, Trewavas spent much of his childhood in the Buckinghamshire town of Aylesbury. It was in Aylesbury that he became involved in several bands, having most success with The Metros, before taking up his long term role in Marillion. Although still a full member of Marillion, Trewavas is also a member of the progressive rock supergroup, Transatlantic. In 2004, Trewavas co-founded another group called Kino, with John Mitchell (Arena), John Beck (It Bites) and Chris Maitland (ex-Porcupine Tree). In 2011, Pete Trewavas joined up with his longtime friend Eric Blackwood to form the duo Edison's Children. The new project was designed to be a creative outlet for Pete Trewavas (who has traditionally recorded in a \\"band\\" or \\"group\\" format on bass and acoustic guitar), in which he could also play lead guitar, lead vocals, drum programming and keyboards as well as have full creative control over the writing and producing of the record with. The 72-minute concept album In The Last Waking Moments... about a man fighting to understand if a recent bizarre happening was reality or a descent into madness, was released on 11.11.11. The Edison's Children project would result in the release of the single \\"A Million Miles Away (I Wish I Had A Time Machine)\\". The song debuted on American Commercial Radio in June 2012 and by September it had reached the FMQB U.S. Commercial Radio Top 40 where it remained for 10 weeks (and stayed in the top 100 for 25 weeks) peaking at No. 32. Edison's Children did live performances in Montreal, Wolverhampton England and Port Zelande Netherlands opening up for Marillion's \\"Brave\\" performances during the Marillion 2013 Weekend. The Montreal show was recorded and released as a B-Side on their \\"In the Last Waking Moments...\\"-EP Single. The UK show was released on their latest album \\"Somewhere Between Here and There\\". Edison's Children released their second album, The Final Breath Before November, on 13 December 2013. It was mixed by Jakko Jakszyk, lead singer of King Crimson, John Mitchell, lead guitarist of It Bites, and Arena and Robin Boult, lead guitarist of Fish. The album featured Eric Blackwood on lead vocals and guitar and composition again along with Henry Rogers of DeeExpus and Touchstone. Pete Trewavas co-wrote and produced the album with Eric Blackwood and played lead guitar and lead vocals on many of tracks along with bass and programming for the symphonic orchestration. Edison's Children is expecting their third album \\"Somewhere Between Here and There\\", a \\"bridge album\\" containing 7 new songs and 6 original mixes from The Final Breath Before November by King Crimson's Jakko Jakszyk and John Mitchell, along with the live version of A Million Miles Away from Wolves UK to be released in June 2015. Work has already begun on a 4th epic album which is expected to be much \\"harder\\" than the more symphonic The Final Breath Before November. On 17 September 2012, during a Marillion concert at The Junction in Cambridge, Steve Hogarth announced that Trewavas was now called \\"Sweet Pea Tremendous\\" as it was the result of putting his name into an anagram solver. Trewavas has also appeared in Prog Aid, the charity project set up to raise money for victims of the 2004 tsunami. Trewavas was a guest musician on English progressive rock band Big Big Train's 2007 album, The Difference Machine. Though primarily a bassist, Trewavas has been known to write keyboard parts during his time with Transatlantic, and has played acoustic guitar on Marillion songs, particularly \\"Faith\\" and \\"Now She'll Never Know\\". With Edison's Children however, Trewavas commonly plays lead guitar, lead vocals, symphonic orchestral programming, guitar synthesizer, drum programming and several middle-eastern instrumentation.

More precisely, a cardinal \\\\kappa is strongly inaccessible if it is uncountable, it is not a sum of fewer than \\\\kappa cardinals that are less than \\\\kappa, and \\\\alpha < \\\\kappa implies 2^{\\\\alpha} < \\\\kappa. The term \\"inaccessible cardinal\\" is ambiguous. Until about 1950, it meant \\"weakly inaccessible cardinal\\", but since then it usually means \\"strongly inaccessible cardinal\\". An uncountable cardinal is weakly inaccessible if it is a regular weak limit cardinal. It is strongly inaccessible, or just inaccessible, if it is a regular strong limit cardinal (this is equivalent to the definition given above). Some authors do not require weakly and strongly inaccessible cardinals to be uncountable (in which case \\\\aleph_0 is strongly inaccessible). Weakly inaccessible cardinals were introduced by , and strongly inaccessible ones by and . Every strongly inaccessible cardinal is also weakly inaccessible, as every strong limit cardinal is also a weak limit cardinal. If the generalized continuum hypothesis holds, then a cardinal is strongly inaccessible if and only if it is weakly inaccessible. \\\\aleph_0 (aleph-null) is a regular strong limit cardinal. Assuming the axiom of choice, every other infinite cardinal number is regular or a (weak) limit. However, only a rather large cardinal number can be both and thus weakly inaccessible. An ordinal is a weakly inaccessible cardinal if and only if it is a regular ordinal and it is a limit of regular ordinals. (Zero, one, and \\\\aleph_0 are regular ordinals, but not limits of regular ordinals.) A cardinal which is weakly inaccessible and also a strong limit cardinal is strongly inaccessible. The assumption of the existence of a strongly inaccessible cardinal is sometimes applied in the form of the assumption that one can work inside a Grothendieck universe, the two ideas being intimately connected.  Models and consistency  Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory with Choice (ZFC) implies that the VŒ∫ is a model of ZFC whenever Œ∫ is strongly inaccessible. And ZF implies that the G√∂del universe LŒ∫ is a model of ZFC whenever Œ∫ is weakly inaccessible. Thus ZF together with \\"there exists a weakly inaccessible cardinal\\" implies that ZFC is consistent. Therefore, inaccessible cardinals are a type of large cardinal. If V is a standard model of ZFC and Œ∫ is an inaccessible in V, then: VŒ∫ is one of the intended models of Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory; and Def(VŒ∫) is one of the intended models of Mendelson's version of Von Neumann‚ÄìBernays‚ÄìG√∂del set theory which excludes global choice, replacing limitation of size by replacement and ordinary choice; and VŒ∫+1 is one of the intended models of Morse‚ÄìKelley set theory. Here Def (X) is the Œî0 definable subsets of X (see constructible universe). However, Œ∫ does not need to be inaccessible, or even a cardinal number, in order for VŒ∫ to be a standard model of ZF (see below). Suppose V is a model of ZFC. Either V contains no strong inaccessible or, taking Œ∫ to be the smallest strong inaccessible in V, VŒ∫ is a standard model of ZFC which contains no strong inaccessibles. Thus, the consistency of ZFC implies consistency of ZFC+\\"there are no strong inaccessibles\\". Similarly, either V contains no weak inaccessible or, taking Œ∫ to be the smallest ordinal which is weakly inaccessible relative to any standard sub-model of V, then LŒ∫ is a standard model of ZFC which contains no weak inaccessibles. So consistency of ZFC implies consistency of ZFC+\\"there are no weak inaccessibles\\". This shows that ZFC cannot prove the existence of an inaccessible cardinal, so ZFC is consistent with the non-existence of any inaccessible cardinals. The issue whether ZFC is consistent with the existence of an inaccessible cardinal is more subtle. The proof sketched in the previous paragraph that the consistency of ZFC implies the consistency of ZFC + \\"there is not an inaccessible cardinal\\" can be formalized in ZFC. However, assuming that ZFC is consistent, no proof that the consistency of ZFC implies the consistency of ZFC + \\"there is an inaccessible cardinal\\" can be formalized in ZFC. This follows from G√∂del's second incompleteness theorem, which shows that if ZFC + \\"there is an inaccessible cardinal\\" is consistent, then it cannot prove its own consistency. Because ZFC + \\"there is an inaccessible cardinal\\" does prove the consistency of ZFC, if ZFC proved that its own consistency implies the consistency of ZFC + \\"there is an inaccessible cardinal\\" then this latter theory would be able to prove its own consistency, which is impossible if it is consistent. There are arguments for the existence of inaccessible cardinals that cannot be formalized in ZFC. One such argument, presented by , is that the class of all ordinals of a particular model M of set theory would itself be an inaccessible cardinal if there was a larger model of set theory extending M and preserving powerset of elements of M. Existence of a proper class of inaccessibles There are many important axioms in set theory which assert the existence of a proper class of cardinals which satisfy a predicate of interest. In the case of inaccessibility, the corresponding axiom is the assertion that for every cardinal Œº, there is an inaccessible cardinal Œ∫ which is strictly larger, Œº < Œ∫. Thus this axiom guarantees the existence of an infinite tower of inaccessible cardinals (and may occasionally be referred to as the inaccessible cardinal axiom). As is the case for the existence of any inaccessible cardinal, the inaccessible cardinal axiom is unprovable from the axioms of ZFC. Assuming ZFC, the inaccessible cardinal axiom is equivalent to the universe axiom of Grothendieck and Verdier: every set is contained in a Grothendieck universe. The axioms of ZFC along with the universe axiom (or equivalently the inaccessible cardinal axiom) are denoted ZFCU (which could be confused with ZFC with urelements). This axiomatic system is useful to prove for example that every category has an appropriate Yoneda embedding. This is a relatively weak large cardinal axiom since it amounts to saying that ‚àû is 1-inaccessible in the language of the next section, where ‚àû denotes the least ordinal not in V, i.e. the class of all ordinals in your model.  Œ±-inaccessible cardinals and hyper-inaccessible cardinals  The term \\"Œ±-inaccessible cardinal\\" is ambiguous and different authors use inequivalent definitions. One definition is that a cardinal Œ∫ is called Œ±-inaccessible, for Œ± any ordinal, if Œ∫ is inaccessible and for every ordinal Œ≤ < Œ±, the set of Œ≤-inaccessibles less than Œ∫ is unbounded in Œ∫ (and thus of cardinality Œ∫, since Œ∫ is regular). In this case the 0-inaccessible cardinals are the same as strongly inaccessible cardinals. Another possible definition is that a cardinal Œ∫ is called Œ±-weakly inaccessible if Œ∫ is regular and for every ordinal Œ≤ < Œ±, the set of Œ≤-weakly inaccessibles less than Œ∫ is unbounded in Œ∫. In this case the 0-weakly inaccessible cardinals are the regular cardinals and the 1-weakly inaccessible cardinals are the weakly inaccessible cardinals. The Œ±-inaccessible cardinals can also be described as fixed points of functions which count the lower inaccessibles. For example, denote by œà0(Œª) the Œªth inaccessible cardinal, then the fixed points of œà0 are the 1-inaccessible cardinals. Then letting œàŒ≤(Œª) be the Œªth Œ≤-inaccessible cardinal, the fixed points of œàŒ≤ are the (Œ≤+1)-inaccessible cardinals (the values œàŒ≤+1(Œª)). If Œ± is a limit ordinal, an Œ±-inaccessible is a fixed point of every œàŒ≤ for Œ≤ < Œ± (the value œàŒ±(Œª) is the Œªth such cardinal). This process of taking fixed points of functions generating successively larger cardinals is commonly encountered in the study of large cardinal numbers. The term hyper-inaccessible is ambiguous and has at least three incompatible meanings. Many authors use it to mean a regular limit of strongly inaccessible cardinals (1-inaccessible). Other authors use it to mean that Œ∫ is Œ∫-inaccessible. (It can never be Œ∫+1-inaccessible.) It is occasionally used to mean Mahlo cardinal. The term Œ±-hyper-inaccessible is also ambiguous. Some authors use it to mean Œ±-inaccessible. Other authors use the definition that for any ordinal Œ±, a cardinal Œ∫ is Œ±-hyper-inaccessible if and only if Œ∫ is hyper-inaccessible and for every ordinal Œ≤ < Œ±, the set of Œ≤-hyper-inaccessibles less than Œ∫ is unbounded in Œ∫. Hyper-hyper-inaccessible cardinals and so on can be defined in similar ways, and as usual this term is ambiguous. Using \\"weakly inaccessible\\" instead of \\"inaccessible\\", similar definitions can be made for \\"weakly Œ±-inaccessible\\", \\"weakly hyper-inaccessible\\", and \\"weakly Œ±-hyper- inaccessible\\". Mahlo cardinals are inaccessible, hyper-inaccessible, hyper- hyper-inaccessible, ... and so on.  Two model-theoretic characterisations of inaccessibility  Firstly, a cardinal Œ∫ is inaccessible if and only if Œ∫ has the following reflection property: for all subsets U ‚äÇ VŒ∫, there exists Œ± < Œ∫ such that (V_\\\\alpha,\\\\in,U\\\\cap V_\\\\alpha) is an elementary substructure of (V_\\\\kappa,\\\\in,U). (In fact, the set of such Œ± is closed unbounded in Œ∫.) Equivalently, Œ∫ is \\\\Pi_n^0-indescribable for all n ‚â• 0. It is provable in ZF that ‚àû satisfies a somewhat weaker reflection property, where the substructure (VŒ±, ‚àà, U ‚à© VŒ±) is only required to be 'elementary' with respect to a finite set of formulas. Ultimately, the reason for this weakening is that whereas the model-theoretic satisfaction relation \\\\models can be defined, truth itself cannot, due to Tarski's theorem. Secondly, under ZFC it can be shown that Œ∫ is inaccessible if and only if (VŒ∫, ‚àà) is a model of second order ZFC. In this case, by the reflection property above, there exists Œ± < Œ∫ such that (VŒ±, ‚àà) is a standard model of (first order) ZFC. Hence, the existence of an inaccessible cardinal is a stronger hypothesis than the existence of a standard model of ZFC.

Early career/Stiltskin  Wilson started off in a band called Guaranteed Pure in the 1990s, which featured himself along with Paul Holmes (keyboards), Steve Wilson (guitars), John Haimes (bass) and Chris Cavanagh (drums). They released an album called Swing Your Bag, the title track of which was included on a compilation album on the label of Fish entitled The Funny Farm Project : Outpatients '93. He then joined Stiltskin; they released one album and had a No. 1 hit in the UK with the single \\"Inside\\".  Genesis  Wilson joined Genesis as the band's lead singer after Phil Collins officially announced his departure in March 1996. Genesis founder members Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford were handed a CD of the Stiltskin album The Mind's Eye from Virgin Records executives. They were impressed with Wilson's vocal abilities and had their manager, Tony Smith, contact him for an audition. Wilson was announced as the new lead singer of Genesis in June 1997. Their only album with Wilson, ...Calling All Stations..., was released that September and became a top 10 worldwide hit, except for the U.S. where it reached No. 54 on the Billboard 200 album chart. The album was re-issued in 2007. Genesis toured Europe in winter 1997 spring 1998, but the American leg was cancelled due to low ticket sales. The band went on an extended hiatus after the critical failure of the album. In May 2001, during an interview with Dave Negrin for website WorldofGenesis.com, Wilson said: > They basically phoned me up and said, \\"Ray, we're not continuing.\\" I've > never really felt that I was out of the band as such; it's just that the > band doesn't exist any more (laughs). When I heard that, it was just after > the Cut tour, about a year and a half ago. I've read some articles saying > that I was fired and stuff, but to be fair to them, they didn't phone me up > and say, \\"Ray, you're fired. We're going to carry on and we're going to get > somebody else to sing.\\" Or, \\"We're going to carry on and get Phil back.\\" > There was never any of that. They just said, \\"We've decided not to continue > because the market doesn't want us.\\" I think they didn't want to completely > close the door to ever doing anything again.  Solo career  In 1999, Wilson released the album Millionairhead with a solo project called Cut_. It was remastered in 2007 with three additional songs added. In 2003, he released a solo album under his own name entitled Change. The next year, he released another studio album entitled The Next Best Thing, which included a new version of the Stiltskin hit \\"Inside\\". In 2006, he released another Stiltskin album called She, and in 2007 a Stiltskin live CD featuring (amongst others) 8 of the 12 songs from She. This live CD was recorded 25 October 2006, at Harmonie, Bonn, Germany. DJ and trance producer Armin van Buuren has produced remixes of the songs \\"Another Day\\" (retitled \\"Yet Another Day\\") and \\"Gypsy\\" from Millionairhead. Both remixes have been released on van Buuren's own albums, and \\"Yet Another Day\\" was also released as a single. In 2014, the first Ray Wilson biography, Gypsy, by journalist Mario Giammetti, was published in Italy (Edizioni Segno). It would be the first ever and only existing book about Wilson's life and musical career. In June 2016, his new solo album Song for a Friend was released, which included ten unreleased acoustic tracks with a cover of Pink Floyd's \\"High Hopes.\\" The original idea for the album title was Backseat Drivers. It was to be a double album. Ray wanted to have one CD with acoustic music and a second CD with electric music. At the eleventh hour he decided to split the two. In an interview he explained the decision was taken because the acoustic version of Song for a Friend would not have got the attention it deserves. The second disc (the electric and rockier collection of new songs) was later released in September of the same year as a stand-alone new album called Makes Me Think of Home. On 7 and 8 September 2018, Wilson gave two exclusive concerts in Pozna≈Ñ at Zamek Culture Centre to celebrate his 50th birthday. Those two special nights titled \\"50th Celebration Birthday Concerts\\" saw Ray performing only Genesis (and band members) material during the first night, while his solo material from his various projects (solo, Stiltskin and Cut_) on the second date. This was the first time he played a full concert without any Genesis songs since his tenure with the band.  Concerts with Steve Hackett  In 2013, Wilson joined Steve Hackett for the latter's Genesis Revisited II Tour as a guest singer. He was featured in a special edition of the Genesis Revisited II album on the track \\"Carpet Crawlers\\". It was the first time since 1998 that Wilson had worked with a fellow Genesis member, albeit one he had not performed with as a member of the band.

Ray met his future wife Tyla Holmes in 2000 (she is the sister of Paul Holmes, the keyboard player in Wilson's then-band Guaranteed Pure). They started dating, and married in 2002. She began working as his assistant, and then tour manager. They separated at the end of 2006 but remained good friends, with Tyla holding her manager role on even after the ending of their relationship. She later left the music industry and concentrated to her career as personal trainer in Australia. In 2007, after a concert in Poland, Wilson met the dancer Ma≈Çgorzata Mielech also known as Gosia. After a few months of dating, he left Edinburgh and moved to Pozna≈Ñ in September 2008. To celebrate their lasting love, in 2016 Ray wrote a song for Gosia entitled \\"Not Long 'Til Springtime\\": she appeared as main actor in the official video of the song. As of 2018, the couple were engaged. Despite Wilson being reluctant in showing and talking about his personal life, he and Gosia gave an important interview with an exclusive photoshoot showing the duo together for the famous Polish magazine \\"Pani\\" in August 2018.

Mahlo cardinals were first described by . As with all large cardinals, none of these varieties of Mahlo cardinals can be proved to exist by ZFC (assuming ZFC is consistent). A cardinal number \\\\kappa is called strongly Mahlo if \\\\kappa is strongly inaccessible and the set U = \\\\\\\\{\\\\lambda<\\\\kappa \\\\mid \\\\lambda\\\\text{ is strongly inaccessible}\\\\\\\\} is stationary in Œ∫. A cardinal \\\\kappa is called weakly Mahlo if \\\\kappa is weakly inaccessible and the set of weakly inaccessible cardinals less than \\\\kappa is stationary in \\\\kappa. The term \\"Mahlo cardinal\\" now usually means \\"strongly Mahlo cardinal\\", though the cardinals originally considered by Mahlo were weakly Mahlo cardinals.  Minimal condition sufficient for a Mahlo cardinal  * If Œ∫ is a limit ordinal and the set of regular ordinals less than Œ∫ is stationary in Œ∫, then Œ∫ is weakly Mahlo. The main difficulty in proving this is to show that Œ∫ is regular. We will suppose that it is not regular and construct a club set which gives us a Œº such that: :Œº = cf(Œº) < cf(Œ∫) < Œº < Œ∫ which is a contradiction. If Œ∫ were not regular, then cf(Œ∫) < Œ∫. We could choose a strictly increasing and continuous cf(Œ∫)-sequence which begins with cf(Œ∫)+1 and has Œ∫ as its limit. The limits of that sequence would be club in Œ∫. So there must be a regular Œº among those limits. So Œº is a limit of an initial subsequence of the cf(Œ∫)-sequence. Thus its cofinality is less than the cofinality of Œ∫ and greater than it at the same time; which is a contradiction. Thus the assumption that Œ∫ is not regular must be false, i.e. Œ∫ is regular. No stationary set can exist below \\\\aleph_0 with the required property because {2,3,4,...} is club in œâ but contains no regular ordinals; so Œ∫ is uncountable. And it is a regular limit of regular cardinals; so it is weakly inaccessible. Then one uses the set of uncountable limit cardinals below Œ∫ as a club set to show that the stationary set may be assumed to consist of weak inaccessibles. *If Œ∫ is weakly Mahlo and also a strong limit, then Œ∫ is Mahlo. Œ∫ is weakly inaccessible and a strong limit, so it is strongly inaccessible. We show that the set of uncountable strong limit cardinals below Œ∫ is club in Œ∫. Let Œº0 be the larger of the threshold and œâ1. For each finite n, let Œºn+1 = 2Œºn which is less than Œ∫ because it is a strong limit cardinal. Then their limit is a strong limit cardinal and is less than Œ∫ by its regularity. The limits of uncountable strong limit cardinals are also uncountable strong limit cardinals. So the set of them is club in Œ∫. Intersect that club set with the stationary set of weakly inaccessible cardinals less than Œ∫ to get a stationary set of strongly inaccessible cardinals less than Œ∫.  Example: showing that Mahlo cardinals Œ∫ are Œ∫-inaccessible (hyper-inaccessible) The term \\"hyper-inaccessible\\" is ambiguous. In this section, a cardinal Œ∫ is called hyper-inaccessible if it is Œ∫-inaccessible (as opposed to the more common meaning of 1-inaccessible). Suppose Œ∫ is Mahlo. We proceed by transfinite induction on Œ± to show that Œ∫ is Œ±-inaccessible for any Œ± ‚â§ Œ∫. Since Œ∫ is Mahlo, Œ∫ is inaccessible; and thus 0-inaccessible, which is the same thing. If Œ∫ is Œ±-inaccessible, then there are Œ≤-inaccessibles (for Œ≤ < Œ±) arbitrarily close to Œ∫. Consider the set of simultaneous limits of such Œ≤-inaccessibles larger than some threshold but less than Œ∫. It is unbounded in Œ∫ (imagine rotating through Œ≤-inaccessibles for Œ≤ < Œ± œâ-times choosing a larger cardinal each time, then take the limit which is less than Œ∫ by regularity (this is what fails if Œ± ‚â• Œ∫)). It is closed, so it is club in Œ∫. So, by Œ∫'s Mahlo-ness, it contains an inaccessible. That inaccessible is actually an Œ±-inaccessible. So Œ∫ is Œ±+1-inaccessible. If Œª ‚â§ Œ∫ is a limit ordinal and Œ∫ is Œ±-inaccessible for all Œ± < Œª, then every Œ≤ < Œª is also less than Œ± for some Œ± < Œª. So this case is trivial. In particular, Œ∫ is Œ∫-inaccessible and thus hyper-inaccessible. To show that Œ∫ is a limit of hyper-inaccessibles and thus 1-hyper-inaccessible, we need to show that the diagonal set of cardinals Œº < Œ∫ which are Œ±-inaccessible for every Œ± < Œº is club in Œ∫. Choose a 0-inaccessible above the threshold, call it Œ±0. Then pick an Œ±0-inaccessible, call it Œ±1. Keep repeating this and taking limits at limits until you reach a fixed point, call it Œº. Then Œº has the required property (being a simultaneous limit of Œ±-inaccessibles for all Œ± < Œº) and is less than Œ∫ by regularity. Limits of such cardinals also have the property, so the set of them is club in Œ∫. By Mahlo-ness of Œ∫, there is an inaccessible in this set and it is hyper-inaccessible. So Œ∫ is 1-hyper-inaccessible. We can intersect this same club set with the stationary set less than Œ∫ to get a stationary set of hyper-inaccessibles less than Œ∫. The rest of the proof that Œ∫ is Œ±-hyper-inaccessible mimics the proof that it is Œ±-inaccessible. So Œ∫ is hyper-hyper-inaccessible, etc..  Œ±-Mahlo, hyper-Mahlo and greatly Mahlo cardinals  The term Œ±-Mahlo is ambiguous and different authors give inequivalent definitions. One definition is that a cardinal Œ∫ is called Œ±-Mahlo for some ordinal Œ± if Œ∫ is strongly inaccessible and for every ordinal Œ≤<Œ±, the set of Œ≤-Mahlo cardinals below Œ∫ is stationary in Œ∫. However the condition \\"Œ∫ is strongly inaccessible\\" is sometimes replaced by other conditions, such as \\"Œ∫ is regular\\" or \\"Œ∫ is weakly inaccessible\\" or \\"Œ∫ is Mahlo\\". We can define \\"hyper-Mahlo\\", \\"Œ±-hyper-Mahlo\\", \\"hyper-hyper-Mahlo\\", \\"weakly Œ±-Mahlo\\", \\"weakly hyper-Mahlo\\", \\"weakly Œ±-hyper-Mahlo\\", and so on, by analogy with the definitions for inaccessibles, so for example a cardinal Œ∫ is called hyper-Mahlo if it is Œ∫-Mahlo. A cardinal Œ∫ is greatly Mahlo or Œ∫+-Mahlo if and only if it is inaccessible and there is a normal (i.e. nontrivial and closed under diagonal intersections) Œ∫-complete filter on the power set of Œ∫ that is closed under the Mahlo operation, which maps the set of ordinals S to {Œ±\\\\inS: Œ± has uncountable cofinality and S‚à©Œ± is stationary in Œ±} The properties of being inaccessible, Mahlo, weakly Mahlo, Œ±-Mahlo, greatly Mahlo, etc. are preserved if we replace the universe by an inner model. Every reflecting cardinal has strictly more consistency strength than a greatly Mahlo, but inaccessible reflecting cardinals aren't in general Mahlo -- see https://mathoverflow.net/q/212597 The Mahlo operation If X is a class of ordinals, them we can form a new class of ordinals M(X) consisting of the ordinals Œ± of uncountable cofinality such that Œ±‚à©X is stationary in Œ±. This operation M is called the Mahlo operation. It can be used to define Mahlo cardinals: for example, if X is the class of regular cardinals, then M(X) is the class of weakly Mahlo cardinals. The condition that Œ± has uncountable cofinality ensures that the closed unbounded subsets of Œ± are closed under intersection and so form a filter; in practice the elements of X often already have uncountable cofinality in which case this condition is redundant. Some authors add the condition that Œ± is in X, which in practice usually makes little difference as it is often automatically satisfied. For a fixed regular uncountable cardinal Œ∫, the Mahlo operation induces an operation on the Boolean algebra of all subsets of Œ∫ modulo the non-stationary ideal. The Mahlo operation can be iterated transfinitely as follows: *M0(X) = X *MŒ±+1(X) = M(MŒ±(X)) *If Œ± is a limit ordinal then MŒ±(X) is the intersection of MŒ≤(X) for Œ≤<Œ± These iterated Mahlo operations produce the classes of Œ±-Mahlo cardinals starting with the class of strongly inaccessible cardinals. It is also possible to diagonalize this process by defining *MŒî(X) is the set of ordinals Œ± that are in MŒ≤(X) for Œ≤<Œ±. And of course this diagonalization process can be iterated too. The diagonalized Mahlo operation produces the hyper-Mahlo cardinals, and so on. Mahlo cardinals and reflection principles Axiom F is the statement that every normal function on the ordinals has a regular fixed point. (This is not a first-order axiom as it quantifies over all normal functions, so it can be considered either as a second-order axiom or as an axiom scheme.) A cardinal is called Mahlo if every normal function on it has a regular fixed point, so axiom F is in some sense saying that the class of all ordinals is Mahlo. A cardinal Œ∫ is Mahlo if and only if a second-order form of axiom F holds in VŒ∫. Axiom F is in turn equivalent to the statement that for any formula œÜ with parameters there are arbitrarily large inaccessible ordinals Œ± such that VŒ± reflects œÜ (in other words œÜ holds in VŒ± if and only if it holds in the whole universe) .

It is often encoded as a subset of the integers (using G√∂del numbering), or as a subset of the hereditarily finite sets, or as a real number. Its existence is unprovable in ZFC, the standard form of axiomatic set theory, but follows from a suitable large cardinal axiom. It was first introduced as a set of formulae in Silver's 1966 thesis, later published as , where it was denoted by Œ£, and rediscovered by , who considered it as a subset of the natural numbers and introduced the notation O# (with a capital letter O; this later changed to the numeral '0'). Roughly speaking, if 0# exists then the universe V of sets is much larger than the universe L of constructible sets, while if it does not exist then the universe of all sets is closely approximated by the constructible sets.  Definition  Zero sharp was defined by Silver and Solovay as follows. Consider the language of set theory with extra constant symbols c1, c2, ... for each positive integer. Then 0# is defined to be the set of G√∂del numbers of the true sentences about the constructible universe, with ci interpreted as the uncountable cardinal ‚Ñµi. (Here ‚Ñµi means ‚Ñµi in the full universe, not the constructible universe.) There is a subtlety about this definition: by Tarski's undefinability theorem it is not, in general, possible to define the truth of a formula of set theory in the language of set theory. To solve this, Silver and Solovay assumed the existence of a suitable large cardinal, such as a Ramsey cardinal, and showed that with this extra assumption it is possible to define the truth of statements about the constructible universe. More generally, the definition of 0# works provided that there is an uncountable set of indiscernibles for some LŒ±, and the phrase \\"0# exists\\" is used as a shorthand way of saying this. There are several minor variations of the definition of 0#, which make no significant difference to its properties. There are many different choices of G√∂del numbering, and 0# depends on this choice. Instead of being considered as a subset of the natural numbers, it is also possible to encode 0# as a subset of formulae of a language, or as a subset of the hereditarily finite sets, or as a real number. Statements implying existence The condition about the existence of a Ramsey cardinal implying that 0# exists can be weakened. The existence of œâ1-Erd≈ës cardinals implies the existence of 0#. This is close to being best possible, because the existence of 0# implies that in the constructible universe there is an Œ±-Erd≈ës cardinal for all countable Œ±, so such cardinals cannot be used to prove the existence of 0#. Chang's conjecture implies the existence of 0#. Statements equivalent to existence Kunen showed that 0# exists if and only if there exists a non-trivial elementary embedding for the G√∂del constructible universe L into itself. Donald A. Martin and Leo Harrington have shown that the existence of 0# is equivalent to the determinacy of lightface analytic games. In fact, the strategy for a universal lightface analytic game has the same Turing degree as 0#. It follows from Jensen's covering theorem that the existence of 0# is equivalent to œâœâ being a regular cardinal in the constructible universe L. Silver showed that the existence of an uncountable set of indiscernibles in the constructible universe is equivalent to the existence of 0#.  Consequences of existence and non-existence  Its existence implies that every uncountable cardinal in the set-theoretic universe V is an indiscernible in L and satisfies all large cardinal axioms that are realized in L (such as being totally ineffable). It follows that the existence of 0# contradicts the axiom of constructibility: V = L. If 0# exists, then it is an example of a non-constructible Œî set of integers. This is in some sense the simplest possibility for a non- constructible set, since all Œ£ and Œ† sets of integers are constructible. On the other hand, if 0# does not exist, then the constructible universe L is the core model‚Äîthat is, the canonical inner model that approximates the large cardinal structure of the universe considered. In that case, Jensen's covering lemma holds: :For every uncountable set x of ordinals there is a constructible y such that x ‚äÇ y and y has the same cardinality as x. This deep result is due to Ronald Jensen. Using forcing it is easy to see that the condition that x is uncountable cannot be removed. For example, consider Namba forcing, that preserves \\\\omega_1 and collapses \\\\omega_2 to an ordinal of cofinality \\\\omega. Let G be an \\\\omega-sequence cofinal on \\\\omega_2^L and generic over L. Then no set in L of L-size smaller than \\\\omega_2^L (which is uncountable in V, since \\\\omega_1 is preserved) can cover G, since \\\\omega_2 is a regular cardinal.  Other sharps  If x is any set, then x# is defined analogously to 0# except that one uses L[x] instead of L. See the section on relative constructibility in constructible universe.  See also  * 0‚Ä†, a set similar to 0# where the constructible universe is replaced by a larger inner model with a measurable cardinal.

The term originated in the late 19th century. These voters would allegedly \\"vote for a yellow dog before they would vote for any Republican\\". Page 34 \\"We're pretty much yellow-dog Democrats here,\\" said an Arkansan last week, explaining the state would vote Democratic even if the party nominates a \\"yellow dog.\\". The Republican party of Nebraska, when its nomination to a state office was equivalent to an election, boasted that it could run \\"a yellow dog\\" for Governor and beat the best and ablest Democrat named for that office. The term is now more generally applied to refer to any Democrat who will vote a straight party ticket under any circumstances. The South Carolina Democratic Party and Mississippi Democratic Party, among other state parties, continue to use the phrase to refer to committed members of the Democratic Party in the \\"Yellow Dog Club\\". The phrase \\"yellow dog\\" may be a reference to a breed of dog known as the Carolina Dog indigenous to the Americas, specifically the Southern United States, and not descended from Eurasian breeds. History and usage The phrase \\"Yellow Dog Democrat\\" is thought to have achieved popularity during the 1928 presidential race between Democratic candidate Al Smith and Republican candidate Herbert Hoover, when Senator J. Thomas Heflin (D-Alabama) crossed party lines and formally supported Hoover. Many Southern voters disliked several items on Smith's platform, as well as his Roman Catholic faith, but still voted for him. The term was also used by Abraham Lincoln in an 1848 speech on the presidential campaign of General Zachary Taylor, whose Democratic opponent was General Lewis Cass. Lincoln derided Cass as one of several recent Democratic presidential candidates in the mold of Andrew Jackson by saying: > A fellow once advertised that he had made a discovery by which he could make > a new man out of an old one, and have enough of the stuff left to make a > little yellow dog. Just such a discovery has Gen. Jackson's popularity been > to you [Democrats]. You not only twice made President of him out of it, but > you have had enough of the stuff left to make Presidents of several > comparatively small men since; and it is your chief reliance now to make > still another.Lincoln Speeches, Abraham Lincoln, Penguin Civic Classics > Series In the run-up to the 1892 presidential election, African-American journalist C. H. J. Taylor of Kansas City, Kansas, in his paper The American Citizen, used the term to refer to Republicans in the West who, he wrote, \\"would vote for a yellow dog out there if he was named Republican.\\"\\"Democrats?\\" The American Citizen, June 17, 1892, p. 1 In 1893, the Kansas City Journal, a Republican paper, criticized \\"This thing of voting for 'yaller dogs', and expecting them to turn black-and-tan after the election,\\"\\"The Farce Over\\", Kansas City Journal, March 2, 1893, p. 4 with reference to Missouri voters always voting for Democrats, then being surprised they were invariably corrupt. In the 1900 Kentucky gubernatorial contest involving Kentucky Governor William Goebel, Theodore Hallam was criticized at a Democratic Party meeting for first supporting Goebel, then campaigning against him. The critic pointed out that Hallam earlier had said \\"if the Democrats of Kentucky, in convention assembled, nominated a yaller dog for governor you would vote for him\\" and asked \\"why do you now repudiate the nominee of that convention, the Honorable William Goebel?\\" Hallam responded: > \\"I admit,\\" he stated blandly, \\"that I said then what I now repeat, namely, > that when the Democratic Party of Kentucky, in convention assembled, sees > fit in its wisdom to nominate a yaller dog for the governorship of this > great state, I will support him ‚Äî but lower than that ye shall not drag > me!\\"Irvin S. Cobb, Exit Laughing, Bobbs-Merrill, 1941. There are indications that the term was in widespread and easily understandable use by 1923. In a letter written in Huntland, Tennessee, by W. L.

The town has a population of 6,730. The parish includes Hamp, Melcombe, Shearston, Woolmersdon and Huntworth. Dating from at least the 10th century and an important settlement in Saxon times, North Petherton became a town only in the late 20th century, until then claiming to be the largest village in England. A former market and administrative centre, North Petherton is now largely a dormitory town for workers in Bridgwater, 3 miles (5 km) to the north east, and Taunton, 8 miles (13 km) to the south west. The centre of the town is designated an Area of High Archaeological Potential (AHAP), and a number of buildings have been given listed building status. Toponymy The town is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Nortperet. The name derives from the area's location to the north side of the River Parrett, from the Latin Parad√¶ 'barge' and from the Old English nor tun. History Long before the Norman Conquest, during Saxon times North Petherton was at the centre of a large royal estate, located on one of the historic communication routes through Somerset, and was both an important centre and the meeting place for the Hundred of North Petherton although the Petherton limit tithing of North Petherton was in the Hundred of Andersfield from the 1670s. At the time of the Norman invasion the Hundred covered a large area corresponding, today, roughly to a north‚Äìsouth corridor along the M5 motorway from Junction 25 near Taunton, to north of Junction 23 at Stretcholt, and east‚Äìwest from Athelney to Goathurst. The Parish of North Petherton continues to be one of the largest in Somerset to this day. =North Petherton Park= King Henry II expanded the royal estate into the Royal Forest (hunting ground) of Petherton Park, which continued to exist until the 17th century. Geoffrey Chaucer (~1343-1400), author of The Canterbury Tales was appointed Deputy Forester of the Royal Forest of North Petherton towards the end of his life. The Royal Forest was probably similar in area to the Saxon Hundred of North Petherton. According to the late 13th century Hundred Rolls, King Henry II of England (d. 1189) gave William of Wrotham lands at North Petherton.Golding \\"Wrotham, William of (d. 1217/18)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Between 1513 and 1535 Sir William Courtenay (d.1535) of Powderham, Devon was the keeper of North Petherton Park. =Other= The town itself it thought to have developed around the minster which, it is supposed, was on the same site as the current church. There is archaeological evidence indicating that there were timber buildings to the west of the church in the late Saxon period, and it is suspected that the remains of the Saxon settlement may continue to lie beneath the town centre. Excavations to the west of the church, on what is now the Community Centre site, revealed a 14th- century cemetery, which may have been used for victims of the plague, as well as indicating that the area was redeveloped in the late Middle Ages. It is thought that there may have been a mint in the town during the 10th or 11th century, and a charter to hold a market was granted in 1318, although it is thought that the market predated this. A shire hall, courthouse and guildhall are known to have exited and were probably located north of the church. A minor skirmish of the English Civil War took place in August 1644 outside what was then the cornhill, now the area of Fore Street between the Community Centre and the former George Inn. The Alfred Jewel, an object about long, made of filigree gold, cloisonn√©-enamelled and with a rock crystal covering, was found in 1693 at Petherton Park, North Petherton. Believed to have been owned by Alfred the Great it is thought to have been the handle for a pointer that would have fit into the hole at its base and been used while reading a book. It is inscribed, \\"AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN,\\" (\\"Alfred had me made\\"). It may be one of the \\"aestels\\" Alfred had sent to each bishopric with a copy of his translation of Pope Gregory the Great's book Pastoral Care. A replica of the jewel can be found in the church of St Mary. North Newton Swing Bridge When the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal was opened in 1827 it joined the River Parrett by a lock at Huntworth, where a basin was constructed, but in 1841 the canal was extended to a floating harbour in Bridgwater, and the Huntworth link was filled in.Charles Hadfield, (1967), The Canals of South West England, David and Charles, The canal and river were not re-connected at this point when the canal was restored, because the Parrett is by then a salt water river laden with silt, whereas the canal contains fresh water. Not only is there a risk of silt entering the canal, but the salt water cannot be allowed to contaminate the fresh, as the canal is still used for the transport of drinking water for Bridgwater's population. The Crossways Swing Bridge over the canal in the parish was built in 1827 by John Rennie. It is a wooden bridge which rotated on steel ball-bearings in a circular track, a very early example of the use of ball bearings in this way. It was designated as a Grade II listed building but the mechanism was removed in 1987. The Higher and Lower Maunsel locks on the canal are either side of the Maunsel bridge which carries the A361. The stone Coxhill road bridge dates from the same time. Woolmersdon House in Woolmersdon is a Grade II listed late Georgian residence. In 1906, North Petherton became the first town in Britain (and perhaps the only one) to have street lights lit by piped acetylene gas, supplied by the North Petherton Gas and Carbide Company, operating from a plant in Mill Lane (photo). The plant was demolished towards the end of the 20th century to form a car park for the local doctor's surgery. Acetylene was replaced in 1931 by coal gas produced in Bridgwater, as well as by the provision of an electricity supply, and the Gas and Carbide Company was wound up. The North Petherton Rosco Acetylene Company (dating from at least 1898) may have supplied gas to the adjacent church prior to the Gas and Carbide Company. In 1926 the Bridgwater Beam Wireless Station was opened north east of the town. It was the UK receiving station for Marconi's UK-to-Canada Beam Wireless Service, (part of the Imperial Wireless Chain,) the first transoceanic shortwave wireless telegraph service in the world and operated until 2002. In 1984 North Petherton was provided with a small public library. As a result of a revitalised fund-raising campaign (originally begun decades earlier), this was followed a few years later by the construction of a Community Centre, opened in 1987, which was extended in 1991. Governance The civil parish of North Petherton includes the villages of North Newton (on the route of the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal) and Northmoor Green (also known as Moorland) in the Somerset Levels, as well as a number of other smaller settlements. Despite several reductions in size, with land redesignated to neighbouring parishes, North Petherton remains one of the largest parishes in Somerset at , and the largest in Sedgemoor. The town council (which is a parish council) has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The town council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The town falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, the library, roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service. An electoral ward exists with the same name. Although North Petherton is the most populous area the ward stretches west to Broomfield and east to Lyng. In the north the ward adjoins Bridgwater. The total population for this ward as at the 2011 census was 7,155. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Geography North Petherton is situated on one of the historic communication routes through Somerset, and a turnpike through the town was opened between Bridgwater and Taunton in the 1730s. The opening of the nearby M5 motorway in the 1970s which relieved major traffic jams on the A38 through the town, also added to the attraction of the town for commuters and has consequently led to the construction of several new housing estates. The town lies on the route of the Macmillan Way West long-distance footpath. A drain on North Moor South east of the town near Lyng, on the opposite side of the M5 motorway but within the parish is North Moor, a 676.3 hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. North Moor is a nationally important grazing marsh and ditch system on the Somerset Levels and Moors. A range of neutral grassland types supporting common and scarce plants has developed mainly due to variations in soils and management practices. Aquatic plant communities are exceptionally diverse with good populations of nationally scarce species. The site has special interest in its bird life. =Climate= Along with the rest of South West England, North Petherton has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8‚Äì15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west. Economy Follyfoot fishery by the A38 south of North Petherton North Petherton used to be a market town, with the right to hold a market having been granted in 1318, along with the right to an annual fair. In the past the town hosted a Starkey Knight and Ford brewery on Fore Street (demolished in the late 1960s), several maltings, a light engineering works (Trig Engineering, since moved to the Huntworth Business Park adjacent to the nearby Junction 24 of the M5 motorway), and in earlier times at least 7 watermills. Basket making and the manufacture of associated products including wicker furniture, was also a significant industry, at one time employing over 100 people in small factories and homes, until its decline in the second half of the 20th century. The products were distributed nationally via the railway station at Bridgwater. Nearby King's Cliff formerly provided a source of building stone for the town dating from at least Medieval times. The production of cloth and leather goods also used to take place in the town, the former being commemorated in the name of the road known as Dyer's Green. The extensive cider orchards that used to surround much of the town in the 19th century had largely disappeared by the end of the 20th, by which time local employment was largely restricted to service businesses and farming. Folly Foot fishery is based on a lake which is stocked with Koi, Mirror, Common and Ghost Carp. A new ¬£100 m Regional Agricultural Business Centre, including an extensive Cattle Market and Dairy opened just beyond the outskirts of the town in 2007, following construction which began in 2006. This replaced the cattle markets in both Taunton and Bridgwater. Education North Petherton junior school North Petherton has two schools, North Petherton juniors and North Petherton infants, however they have been joined together to form one school, North Petherton Primary School. Secondary schools in nearby Bridgwater include: Robert Blake Science College, Brymore School, Chilton Trinity School, East Bridgwater Community School which was previously known as Sydenham School and is a Performing and Visual Arts College, and Haygrove School which has specialist Language College status. Special schools in the town include: Elmwood Special School, New Horizon Centre School and Penrose School. Further Education is provided by Bridgwater College which was formerly Bridgwater Technical School. Religious sites The community centre with St Mary's church tower behind The town has the minster church of St Mary the Virgin, with a highly decorated tower which, at high, is claimed to be one of the tallest towers in the West Country. The building is mainly dated from the 15th century, with a minstrel gallery from 1623, a peal of six bells, and a clock built in Bridgwater in 1807. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. The Church of St Peter has a tower which may be of Saxon origin which was altered in 1635. The rest of the church was completely rebuilt for Rev. Thomas Eaton in 1885. It is Grade II* listed. The Church of St. Michael has Norman origins and has seen various restorations since. It was last restored and extended in 1868 for Slade family of Maunsel House. In the cemetery is a 19th-century combined Non-conformist and Anglican Mortuary Chapel. Culture The annual North Petherton Carnival is part of the West Country Carnival circuit, and takes place in November, on the Saturday after the first Thursday in November. The date of the first Carnival at Bridgwater is the preceding Saturday, featuring most of the same participants. The Walnut Tree (rebranded in the 1970s from the Clarence Hotel, and before that as the New Inn) which now provides the only hotel accommodation in the town, was formerly in competition with the George Hotel (now closed), where monthly petty sessions (court hearings) were formerly held.

There are many different types of indescribable cardinals corresponding to different choices of languages Q. They were introduced by . A cardinal number Œ∫ is called Œ†-indescribable if for every Œ†m proposition œÜ, and set A ‚äÜ VŒ∫ with (VŒ∫+n, ‚àà, A) ‚äß œÜ there exists an Œ± < Œ∫ with (VŒ±+n, ‚àà, A ‚à© VŒ±) ‚äß œÜ. Here one looks at formulas with m-1 alternations of quantifiers with the outermost quantifier being universal. Œ£-indescribable cardinals are defined in a similar way. The idea is that Œ∫ cannot be distinguished (looking from below) from smaller cardinals by any formula of n+1-th order logic with m-1 alternations of quantifiers even with the advantage of an extra unary predicate symbol (for A). This implies that it is large because it means that there must be many smaller cardinals with similar properties. The cardinal number Œ∫ is called totally indescribable if it is Œ†-indescribable for all positive integers m and n. If Œ± is an ordinal, the cardinal number Œ∫ is called Œ±-indescribable if for every formula œÜ and every subset U of VŒ∫ such that œÜ(U) holds in VŒ∫+Œ± there is a some Œª<Œ∫ such that œÜ(U ‚à© VŒª) holds in VŒª+Œ±. If Œ± is infinite then Œ±-indescribable ordinals are totally indescribable, and if Œ± is finite they are the same as Œ†-indescribable ordinals. Œ±-indescribability implies that Œ±<Œ∫, but there is an alternative notion of shrewd cardinals that makes sense when Œ±‚â•Œ∫: there is Œª<Œ∫ and Œ≤ such that œÜ(U ‚à© VŒª) holds in VŒª+Œ≤. Œ†-indescribable cardinals are the same as weakly compact cardinals. A cardinal is inaccessible if and only if it is Œ†-indescribable for all positive integers n, equivalently iff it is Œ†-indescribable, equivalently iff it is Œ£-indescribable. A cardinal is Œ£-indescribable iff it is Œ†-indescribable. The property of being Œ†-indescribable is Œ†. For m>1, the property of being Œ†-indescribable is Œ£ and the property of being Œ£-indescribable is Œ†. Thus, for m>1, every cardinal that is either Œ†-indescribable or Œ£-indescribable is both Œ†-indescribable and Œ£-indescribable and the set of such cardinals below it is stationary. The consistency strength is Œ£-indescribable cardinals is below that of Œ†-indescribable, but for m>1 it is consistent with ZFC that the least Œ£-indescribable exists and is above the least Œ†-indescribable cardinal (this is proved from consistency of ZFC with Œ†-indescribable cardinal and a Œ£-indescribable cardinal above it). Measurable cardinals are Œ†-indescribable, but the smallest measurable cardinal is not Œ£-indescribable. However there are many totally indescribable cardinals below any measurable cardinal. Totally indescribable cardinals remain totally indescribable in the constructible universe and in other canonical inner models, and similarly for Œ† and Œ£ indescribability.
