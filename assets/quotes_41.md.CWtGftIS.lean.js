In a racing career which lasted from March 1995 until December 1996 she ran sixteen times, recording ten wins, two seconds and two third places. As a three-year-old in 1995 she began her season in minor Irish races and made steady improvement, winning seven races including the Brownstown Stakes, Matron Stakes, Prix de l'Op√©ra and E. P. Taylor Stakes. In the following season she added wins in the Bayerisches Zuchtrennen, Beverly D. Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes. After her retirement from racing Timarida had some success as a dam of winners for her owner's stud, with her last foal being born in 2006. Background Timarida was a grey mare bred in Ireland by her owner Aga Khan IV. During her racing career she was trained at Kilcullen in County Kildare by John Oxx. Timarida's sire Kalaglow, from whom she inherited her grey colour, was a top-class middle- distance horse who won the Eclipse Stakes and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 1982. The best of his other offspring included the Melbourne Cup winner Jeune and the Grosser Preis von Berlin winner Sternkoenig. Her dam Triumphant showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race at Chester Racecourse from eight starts as a three-year-old in 1980. She was, however, a half-sister to Relkino, and, as descendant of the broodmare Ballisland, was closely related to Tarascon and Al Hareb. Racing career 1995: three-year-old season Timarida did not race as a two- year-old and made her racecourse debut in a minor race over seven furlongs on heavy ground at Leopardstown Racecourse on 17 March. Ridden by Christy Roche he started the 7/4 favourite and won by two lengths from her stablemate Sharatan. She was then off the racecourse for two and a half months before returning to the track to win a handicap race at the Curragh, beating seventeen opponents under top weight of 128 pounds. She followed up by winning a similar event at Galway Races on 1 August and was then stepped up in class to contest the Listed Brownstown Stud Stakes over one mile at Leopardstown six days later. Ridden by Johnny Murtagh she started the 7/4 favourite and won by four lengths from the Aidan O'Brien-trained Anemone Garden. Less than two weeks later the filly was back in action and stepped up again in class for the Group 3 Desmond Stakes at the Curragh in which she was matched against male opposition and older fillies and mares. Ridden by Roche she came from off the pace to challenge for the lead in the last quarter mile but hung to the right in the closing stages and was beaten a head by the five-year-old mare Ivory Frontier. After an enquiry by the racecourse stewards Ivory Frontier and Timarida were relegated to second and third for causing interference to the third-placed finisher Mr Martini. On 10 September Timarida returned to all- female competition for the Matron Stakes (then a Group 3 race) at the Curragh and started 7/2 second favourite behind the British challenger Warning Shadows who had finished second to Ridgewood Pearl in the Irish 1000 Guineas. Ridden by Murtagh, Timarida turned into the straight in fifth place before moving up to dispute the lead in the final quarter mile. She stayed on strongly in the closing stages and won by a neck and half a length from Lap of Luury and Warning Shadows. Three weeks later the filly was stepped up to Group 2 class when she was sent to France for the Prix de l'Op√©ra over 1800 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. She was coupled in the betting with the Aga Khan's French-trained filly Balanka and started 2.5/1 favourite ahead of nine other fillies and mares including Vadlamixa (Prix de Lieurey), Garden Rose (Prix Chlo√©), Angel In My Heart (Prix de Psych√©), Tryphosa (German 1,000 Guineas) and Erin Bird (Premio Regina Elena). Timarida raced towards the rear of the field before being switched to the outside by Murtagh in the traight. She took the lead 200 metres from the finish and drew away in the closing stages to win by two and a half lengths from Angel In My Heart. Frankie Dettori took the ride when Timarida was sent to Canada to contest the Grade II E. P. Taylor Stakes over ten furlongs at Woodbine Racetrack on 15 October. She was made the 5.5/1 second favourite behind the French challenger Matiara (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches) in a thirteen-runner field which also included Northern Emerald (Flower Bowl Invitational Stakes), Danish (Queen Elizabeth II Challenge Cup Stakes) and Warning Shadows. After settling in sixth place Timarida moved forward approaching the final turn, took the lead in the straight and won by three and a half lengths from Matiara. 1996: four-year-old season As a four-year-old Timarida was ridden in all of her races by Murtagh. After winning seven of her eight races in 1995, the filly began her third campaign with three consecutive defeats. She finished second to the colt Definite Article in the Tattersalls Gold Cup at the Curragh in May and then made her only appearance in England when she ran poorly and finished unplaced in the Queen Anne Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot in June. At the end of the month she started favourite for the International Stakes but despite finishing strongly she failed to overhaul the British-trained three-year-old colt Gothenberg. She was then sent to Germany to contest the Group 1 Bayerisches Zuchtrennen at Munich on 4 August. Her opponents included Germany, La Blue (German 1,000 Guineas), Montjoy (Prix Guillaume d'Ornano) and Needle Gun (Gallinule Stakes). In a finish dominated by females Timarida took the lead 200 metres from the finish and won by half a length and a neck from Germany and La Blue. Less than three weeks after her victory in Germany, Timarida made her first appearance in the United States when she ran in the Grade I Beverly D Stakes over nine and a half furlongs on firm turf at Arlington Park in Chicago. She was made the 1.6/1 joint favourite alongside the French contender Khalisa (Prix Chlo√©) with the other eight runners including Matiara, Perfect Arc (Queen Elizabeth II Challenge Cup), Bail Out Becky (Del Mar Oaks), Auriette (Gamely Handicap), Alpride (Yellow Ribbon Invitational Stakes) and Flagbird (Premio Presidente della Repubblica). After being restrained by Murtagh in the early stages Timarida overtook the front-running Perfect Arc in the straight and pulled away to win by two and a half lengths. Matiara died soon after the race as a result of a pelvic injury. Commenting on the race John Oxx said \\"We were a bit concerned that we would end up farther back than we'd like. Then, you need a little luck. That's exactly what happenened. When the gap opened, she was ready to take it.\\" The Aga Khan observed \\"Timarida is a very courageous filly and has a tremendous turn of foot.\\" On her return to Europe Timarida contested the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown on 14 September. Her opponents on this occasion were Shaamit, Dance Design, Tamayaz (Rose of Lancaster Stakes), Glory of Dancer (Gran Criterium, Great Voltigeur Stakes) and Idris (Desmond Stakes). After racing at the rear of the field as Dance Design set the pace, the filly was switched to the outside to make her challenge in the last quarter mile. She overtook Dance Design inside the final furlong and won \\"snugly\\" by one and a half lengths. Following Timarida's third consecutive win at the highest level the Aga Khan let it be known that the filly would probably be retired from racing at the end of the season. At Newmarket Racecourse on 19 October Timarida ran for the second time in England in a very strong edition of the Champion Stakes and finished third behind Bosra Sham and Halling. On her final run of the season she was sent to the United States again and finished fourth to Wandesta in the Matriarch Stakes at Hollywood Park Racetrack on 1 December. Breeding record After her retirement from racing Timarida became a broodmare for the Aga Khan's stud in Ireland. She produced at least seven foals and five winners between 1998 and 2006: *Tilimsana, a bay filly, foaled in 1998, sired by Darshaan. Unraced. *Timawari, bay colt (later gelded), 1999, by Sadler's Wells. Won two races. *Timisvar, bay colt, 2002, by Sinndar. Won one National Hunt race. *Timakara, bay filly, 2003, by Green Desert.

Irma was the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands on record, followed by Maria two weeks later. At the time, it was considered as the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region, outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico until it was surpassed by Hurricane Dorian two years later. It was also the third strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall ever recorded, just behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane and Hurricane Dorian. The ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, second major hurricane, and first Category 5 hurricane of the 2017 season, Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime, particularly in the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys. It was also the most intense hurricane to strike the continental United States since Katrina in 2005, the first major hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma in the same year, and the first Category 4 hurricane to strike the state since Charley in 2004. The word Irmageddon was coined soon after the hurricane to describe the damage caused by the hurricane. Irma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August 30\\\\. Favorable conditions allowed Irma to rapidly intensify into a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson wind scale by late on August 31\\\\. The storm's intensity fluctuated between Categories 2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles. On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by early on the next day. Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 180 mph (285 km/h) and a minimum pressure of . Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed. Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category 4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category 5 status before making landfall in Cuba. Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category 2 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category 4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, before making landfall on Cudjoe Key on September 10\\\\. Irma then weakened to Category 3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on Marco Island later that day. The system degraded into a remnant low over Alabama and ultimately dissipated on September 13 over Missouri. The storm caused catastrophic damage in Barbuda, Saint Barth√©lemy, Saint Martin, Anguilla, and the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 hurricane. The hurricane caused at least 134 deaths: one in Anguilla; one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the US and globally in 2017. Meteorological history The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26. The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27. Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29. Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands. Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates. With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air. Sea surface temperatures in Hurricane Irma's path. The nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images. Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane ‚Äì around 00:00 UTC on September 1. Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane's intensity had increased by 65 mph (105 km/h). On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact. A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4. The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). On September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane. As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of 175 mph (280 km/h). The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at 180 mph (285 km/h) near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands. Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm's central minimum pressure having bottomed out at ‚Äì this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 180 mph (285 km/h). Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm's central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall. Katia, Irma, and Jose, the first occurrence since 2010. As the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls. Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico. Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7\\\\. After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8\\\\. This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above ‚Äì behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane. At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of 155 mph (250 km/h). The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north. Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re- intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized. The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of 165 mph (270 km/h). This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane. As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9. Andrew and Irma, showing the size comparison of the storms After slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States. Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined. In addition, Irma's wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter. The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h). Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall. Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation ‚Äì though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds. The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics. At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished. The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13. Preparations Caribbean Infrared satellite loop of Irma approaching the northern Leeward Islands on September 5, around the time of its upgrade to a Category 5 hurricane Given that Irma's forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5. In Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds. Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations. Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized. The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf. Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding. In Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion. Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6. Hospitals stocked up on three days' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators. Of the island's 32 municipalities, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter. The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barth√©lemy. Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas. The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin. and Saint Barth√©lemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact. On September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency. By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre- staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution. On September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later. According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm's arrival. Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts. In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts. While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others \\"admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma's approach.\\" Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist. In the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened. Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp. In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane's arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters. By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini. Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm. Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands. Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country. In Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit. Fuel conservation was enacted in Camag√ºey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages. The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low- lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey. Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter. Mainland United States The NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States. The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee. The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9\\\\. At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida-Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa-Walton county line and the other from the Florida- Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina. Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12. =Florida= 'Florida Governor Rick Scott on Evacuations' video from Voice of America On September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency. Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations. All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8. Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits. The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated. Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike. All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period. The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose. By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed. Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened. The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida. Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9. Doral installing hurricane shutters in advance of the storm Many airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed. Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled. Along Florida's coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access. For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm. Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12\\\\. Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed. The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15. An estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties. All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation. Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave. Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties. emergency shoulder use by moving traffic), while westbound lanes are almost empty at 5 PM on a Saturday afternoon A record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state's history. Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida's Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC's forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast. Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma's arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol. Use of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9. It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations. The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic. Officials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites. Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities. =Elsewhere= Georgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10\\\\. Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning. Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day. In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave. Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia. All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls. Video by mayor of Fayetteville, North Carolina Nat Robertson North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day. Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states. Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination. On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees. This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs. Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge. =Sports= In professional sports, the Miami Dolphins‚ÄìTampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm's threat. The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers. The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11‚Äì13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens. Minor League Baseball's Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co- champions. The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families. The Orlando Pride of the National Women's Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma. In college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF's game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State. UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF's stadium hosted the National Guard. The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled. The Miami Hurricanes‚ÄìArkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami. The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled. The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana‚ÄìMonroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8. The Seminoles' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7. The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day. =FEMA funding= As of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida. Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.

Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences. Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria. Antigua and Barbuda A house in Barbuda that was badly damaged by the hurricane The eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of 160 mph (257 km/h). The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma's passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands. Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island. Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others. The destruction rendered the island's sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative‚Äîincluding water and telecommunication services‚Äîwhich further hampered relief efforts. Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million. A total of three storm-related deaths have been reported on the island. In addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda's human residents, concern turned to the storm's effects on the island's wildlife. The island's only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane. It is unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath. Barbuda's Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge. Remaining just outside of Irma's strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees. Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas. Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries. Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million. Saint Martin Aerial video of the damage on Saint Martin, September 7, 2017 On the morning of September 6, Irma's center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout. Irma's extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory. On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other. A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze. Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor. Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows. Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition. As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable. Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses. Total losses exceeded ‚Ç¨3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion). A similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin's Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft \\"as if they were matches\\". The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with \\"huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.\\" It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten's houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters. There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory. Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane. Total damage were estimated at ‚Ç¨2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion). Saint Barth√©lemy Irma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barth√©lemy, southeast of Saint Martin. Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to \\"a bomb that burned all vegetation,\\" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively \\"erased the island from the map\\". Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation. Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture. The island's fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters. With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island's population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service. The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM's analysts. Preliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined ‚Ç¨1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts. This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined. Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years. On January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing. Anguilla The British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6. Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island's only hospital was badly damaged. The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses. In The Valley, the island's capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings. Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated. About 90% of roads were left impassable. The island's air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island. One death was reported on the island. Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million. Rest of the Lesser Antilles Large swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads. Seaside roads were inundated with water. One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck. Trees were also destroyed. The hurricane's effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe. Several houses were damaged. Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water. Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas. Saint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands. Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island's water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere. Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained \\"significant damage.\\" The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane's winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages. Several houses were left uninhabitable. On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people. CEDIM's analysts expect economic losses of $20‚Äì65 million for the two islands. British Virgin Islands Operational Land Imager imagery by Landsat 8 of the Virgin Islands from before and after Hurricane Irma's impact, depicting a \\"browning\\" of the landscape and vegetation. Damage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive. Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane's core. Four people were confirmed dead. Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station. Satellite images revealed many of the island's residential zones had been left in ruins. The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson. Most homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.'s four main islands. The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory. After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months. U.S. Virgin Islands U.S. Navy video of damage in the U.S. Virgin Islands Irma's effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least 12 inches (305 mm) of rain fell, and on Saint John. Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport. Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie's hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks. Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island. On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure. Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport. Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power. Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion. Puerto Rico The hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory. Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water. Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of . However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported. Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority's customers lost electricity. Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayam√≥n, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides. The most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island. On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services. At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage. High winds also toppled a number of trees. The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours. In rural Lo√≠za, 79 homes were destroyed. Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages. At least 362,000 customers lost water services. Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads. Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million. Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed. Hurricane Irma was attributed to approximately $759.4 million in damage and four fatalities in Puerto Rico. Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning. Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived. Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Can√≥vanas. Governor Ricardo Rossell√≥ declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas. Hispaniola Hurricane Irma north of Hispaniola on September 7, 2017 People stand in a flooded street that usually serves as a farmers market, in Ouanaminthe, northeast Haiti, September 8, 2017. Although spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains. A bridge over the Dajab√≥n River connecting the two countries was broken. In the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes. 55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts. By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes. In Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Ha√Øtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives. Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country. The total expanse of the flooding stretched from M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic. Turks and Caicos Islands On the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands. While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours. Communications infrastructure was destroyed. On September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being \\"gone\\". The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged. On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost. Total damage was estimated at over $500 million. The Bahamas In the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8. It also passed \\"almost directly over\\" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology. Damages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8. On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications. On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island's school lost its roof entirely. The Morton Salt Company's signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages. The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage. In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini. Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million. While Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds. Cuba Patrol boat Admiral Didiez Burgos of the Dominican Navy delivering disaster supplies in Havana Harbor after Hurricane Irma. Early on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camag√ºey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of 165 mph (270 km/h). The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de √Åvila Province. The weather station at Esmeralda, Camag√ºey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed. The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm. Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded . Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province. Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes. A total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma. The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed. Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools. Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service. About of roads were damaged. Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm. Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history. The tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa Mar√≠a and the nearby town of Caibari√©n received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded. The storm most severely Ciego de √Åvila and Villa Clara provinces. Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana. By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malec√≥n. Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005. In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed. Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage. The town of Cabaigu√°n in Sancti Sp√≠ritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled. Hurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba's northern Cayo Coco. Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds. Mainland United States True-color images before and after the passage of Irma, in which light blue indicates sediment suspended in the water, kicked up by the intensity of the storm Hurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida. Except the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned. Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys. The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States. After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said \\"I thought we would see more damage\\" [on the mainland] but said \\"he witnessed devastation in the Keys\\". President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was \\"far greater than anyone thought\\". Damage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion. At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005. However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest. At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina. =Florida= Remains of a neighborhood destroyed by Hurricane Irma in Big Pine Key The storm's large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle. The highest reported sustained wind speed was 112 mph (180 km/h) on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was 142 mph (229 km/h), recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys. More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point ‚Äì approximately 73% of state. Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma's path, including a peak total of 21.66 in (550 mm) in Fort Pierce. Heavy precipitation ‚Äì and storm surge, in some instances ‚Äì overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries. Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone. Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage. It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew. Throughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents. About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning. Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida. Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home. The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning. The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties. Boats washed up on U.S. Route 1 in the Florida Keys With Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state. Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain. An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall. Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished. On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed. Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage. Hurricane Jose can be seen to the lower right. After devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane. Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast. Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage. Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million. Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas. More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed. Damage in the county totaled about $857 million. Impact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages. However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost. Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach. Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties. In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost. Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed. In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage. Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded. A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County. Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage. Overflight of Jacksonville after Hurricane Irma Along much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding. However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties. In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964. Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city. Water reached about high in some homes. The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage. In St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable. Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine's historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River. In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former. About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county. A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage. =Other states= Three deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees. On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding. In Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately . By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina. Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents. Light damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee. About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma. Aftermath In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma's path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies. Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid. The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region. International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories. Some of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other. Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti. Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico. Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds. Antigua and Barbuda In response to Hurricane Jose's approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda. A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims‚Äîincluding bottled water, canned food and power generators. British Overseas Territories A UK Royal Logistics Corp landing raft delivers emergency relief to Anguilla RFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers. The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla's main petrol dump, restored power to the island's hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane. The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017 to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water. HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield. As part of a ¬£32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton. This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts. The British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order. UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government's preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate. Royal Marines delivering aid and providing support to the islanders of Jost Van Dyke, British Virgin Islands By September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional ¬£25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017 and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days. Anguilla's Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government's response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson's visit to the island \\"sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane\\", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough. By September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island. In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands. 120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15. Amendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to ¬£13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK's Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017. The Bahamas By the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage. The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma's eye, remained largely inaccessible for days. Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed. Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations. The worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma's eye had directly passed. After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable. Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently. Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands. On Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced. Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system. Aside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages. International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S. Cuba Swollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations. Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas. The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged. Hispaniola In the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma's departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8. President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port. More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged. In Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings. At least 5,000 homes were flooded. One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured. The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Ha√Øtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks. Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities. United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well. Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma's effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination. United States territories In the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock. By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance. Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region. At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a \\"horrific disaster\\" for which \\"[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.\\" The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew. Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state's own experience with Irma. On Saint John, described as \\"perhaps the site of Irma's worst devastation on American soil,\\" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response. The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor. The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami. There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017. By September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters. Hospitals were operating on generator power. The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques. By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico. Saint Martin and French Overseas Department Damage to Sint Maarten's harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Esp√©rance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane. The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft. The following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose. Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military. On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members. French President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies. In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barth√©lemy. On both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma's aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft. In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel. The day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Esp√©rance Airport. On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique. Florida President Donald Trump visits Naples, Florida to talk with people impacted by Hurricane Irma Sporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non- essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm. On September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys. The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route. Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City. USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery. On September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada. Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key. By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West. On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon. Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City. Nighttime satellite images of Florida before (left) and the night after (right) Hurricane Irma, highlighting the extensive loss of grid (mains) electricity Due mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel. In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County. NOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm. The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area. Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed. Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys. In the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas. Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane. A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant. One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters. Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure. Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk. Following Irma's passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old. The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping. Due to Irma's and Hurricane Harvey's impact in Florida and Texas, the U.S. employment declined in September for the first time since September 2010. The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September. Records Irma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall. When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7¬∞W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979. By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of . This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed. Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of 190 mph (305 km/h), and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of 185 mph (295 km/h). At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007. In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units. Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values. On September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength. This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998, Megi of 2010, and Yutu of 2018 as the sixth- strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally ‚Äì in terms of sustained winds ‚Äì trailing only Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of 190 mph (305 km/h) at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of 185 mph (295 km/h) at landfall. Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007. Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995. In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924. Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane. Irma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a pressure of 931 mbar (hPa; 27.49 inHg), making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992. In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes‚ÄîHarvey and Irma‚Äîstruck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season. This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes. The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004. Retirement On April 11, 2018, at the 40th session of the RA IV hurricane committee, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists, due to the extensive amount of damage and loss of life it caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane. It will be replaced with Idalia for the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season.

The Arezzo 1465 vase is an Attic volute krater attributed to Euphronios, that dates to the Late Archaic period (550-510 BCE). It is a red-figure style vase, which became popular during the time of its making, and it was found in Arezzo, Italy in the Etruria region in 1465 due to the vast trade network stemming from Athens. The vase is currently housed in Arezzo, in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale.277x277px  Description  294x294px The entire body of the vase primarily focuses on an amazonomachy, which is a battle between the Greeks and the Amazons, a nation of all-female warriors from mythology. One side leads into the other, showing three Greek hoplites and an Amazon seemingly running into battle, shown by their equipment of shields, spears, and helmets. The other side shows Herakles and Telamon battling the Amazons. The frieze on the neck shows a komos, which is a drunken ritual that was performed during Ancient Greek celebrations. Euphronios chose to include multiple inscriptions on this krater: CHORITHON, KAIKEOS, (kalos/kale) PHILLIADESKALOS, (kalos/kale) XENON KALOS, LYSIS, PHILLIADES, TEISIS, XENON, and XINIS Euphronios was a part of the Pioneer Group, and was known to be a major component in the transition from black-figure to red-figure pottery in Ancient Greece. His use of red-figure on this krater allowed him to add an increasing amount of detail to the figures and scenes he depicted, like the textures of Herakles' club and lion skin.  Depictions  All depictions on this vase point towards warfare in Ancient Greece. The body shows an amazonomachy with clear indications of Greek Hoplites, which all carry spears and wear the style of helmet and shield that were historically attributed to Hoplites, as well as hints towards the other warriors being the Amazons, due to their use of a bow rather than spear, the long thin bodies indicative of a more feminine body type, and their different style of clothing. Herakles is known to be a great warrior and hero, so the placement of him among everything else is also indicative of some sort of battle, or of something that he is contributing his efforts in order to reign victorious. Telamon, a friend of the demigod Herakles, is commonly thought of in reference to the myth where Telamon assists Herakles in killing the sea monster that Poseidon sends to destroy the city of Troy, rather than an amazonomachy like this krater depicts, however his presence then further solidifies the warfare theme as he is directly tied to another mythical battle. Even the komos scene along the neck of the vase is a celebration. Though the direct purpose of a komos is still unclear, they were performed at post-game celebrations for victorious athletes. In Ancient Greece, people regarded warriors as the greatest athletes, with Herakles as the epitome of heroic athletes, so even this contributes to the warfare theme. The komos scene could be celebrating the victory of Herakles over the Amazons in his 9th labor to retrieve the Belt of Hippolyta, the queen of the Amazons, as this is the only mythological reference to any interaction between Herakles and the Amazons. However, as none of the Amazons on this krater are identifiable as Hippolyta and the belt is not on the vase either, it can only be said with certainty that this vase depicts an amazonomachy which involves Herakles.

Like most of the Radiolaria taxonomy, Collodaria was first described by Ernst Haeckel, a German scholar who published three volumes of manuscript describing the extensive samples of Radiolaria collected by the voyage of HMS Challenger. Recent molecular phylogenetic studies concluded that there are Collodaria contains three families, Sphaerozodae, Collosphaeridae, and Collophidilidae.  Story and origin  Ernst Haeckel is the main contributor to species description in the phylum Radiolaria, which contains the order Collodaria. Members of Collodaria were first described in 1862. In 1881, Collodaria was defined by Haeckel in 1881 as ‚ÄúSpumellaria without latticed shell.‚Äù The story behind this order involved the historic voyage of HMS Challenger. As recorded in the manuscript of \\"Report on the Scientific Results of the Voyage of H.M.S. Challenger during the years 1873-1876,\\" HMS Challenger embarked from Portsmouth, England in December 1872. On board this military vessel that had auxiliary steam power were physicists, chemists and biologists led by Captain Wyville Thomson, collaborating in an interdisciplinary venture to discover the diversity of life. With guns removed from the ships and replaced with long sampling rope, wire, thermometers, bottom samplers and water bottles, ‚Äúnaturalists‚Äù on board collected samples of marine organisms and fossils throughout the ocean waters. After the death of Wyville Thomson, his successor John Murray supervised the publication and research of collected data from the voyage at which point samples of radiolarians were passed onto Haeckel who was already a professor at the University of Jena, Germany. In the editorial notes of the report, Murray stated that Haeckel's \\"Report on the Radiolaria collected by H.M.S. Challenger\\" represents Haeckel's ten years' devotion. In Haeckel's report, all existing knowledge on Radiolaria was recorded, and older species and fossils were redescribed into three volumes. It is indisputable that Haeckel's contribution built the foundation of morphological knowledge in Radiolaria and its orders including Collodaria. However, research in recent years has found major discrepancies between molecular phylogenetic trees and Haeckel's morphology-based phylogenetic trees. Mistakes in phylogeny were likely made when Haeckel characterized different lifecycles as two species. Some of these discrepancies are addressed in the summary of the most recent research on the phylogenetic relationships within Collodaria found in following section.  Habitat and ecology  Collodarians are found throughout the oceans but high populations of Collodarians aggregate in calm and oligotrophic surface waters. Biard et al. (2015) quoted high densities of Collodarian colonies has been reported in the Gulf of Aden and in the North Pacific Ocean. The diverse distribution and abundance of Collodaria suggest its significance in ecology and the biogeochemical pathways of the oceans. Collodarians are mixotrophs involved in different trophic levels within the ocean food webs since they can actively prey on a variety of organisms including copepods, ciliates, phytoplankton, and bacteria. Collodarians can participate in carbon fixation as most species have acquired intracellular microalgae symbionts (Hollande and Enjumet 1953). Dinoflagellate Brandotodium nutricula is a common endosymbiont of Collodarians.  Description of morphological diversity  Aside from the common morphology shared by radiolarians such as the axopodia, nucleus and metabolic organelles in internal endoplasm and the separation of external and internal endoplasm by the central capsule, most species of Collodaria form colonies in nature. Anderson et al. (1999) observed that the colony shapes are not species-specific. Colonial Collodarian cells can agglutinate in a gelatinous matrix that can be as small as a few mm to as large as 3 m in length. There have been observations of large solitary species (up to a few mm). Three types of skeleton are observed in Collodaria: some species create shell-like skeleton around the central capsule, others form silica spicules or have no mineral structures. The shape of central capsules and density of cytoplasmic vacuoles can vary among species and may serve as a distinguishing taxonomic character such as the separation of the genera Collophidium and Collozoum within the family of Sphaerozoidae.  Fossil records  The siliceous shells of Collodaria are often preserved in sediment for millions of years. Micropaleontologists have utilized the fossil records of Collodaria to describe extinct species and the evolution of extant species through time using various notable features on the skeleton such as the size, number of radiate spines, and the presence of appendages. It was estimated that the lineage of Radiolarians, the ancestors of Collodaria, arose in early Paleozoic era.  Phylogenetic relationships   Sister orders of Collodaria  In the Haeckel's work, Collodaria was named the first order of Radiolaria, and defined as ‚ÄúSpumellaria without latticed shell.‚Äù This definition of Collodaria was further expanded to include organisms that either completely lack the skeleton or have numerous spicules that loosely scatter throughout the calymma around the central capsule. In recent literature, the definition of Collodaria has been altered with molecular phylogenetic characteristics. In Haeckel's phylogeny, the second order in Radiolaria, Sphaerellaria, includes all Radiolaria with any trace of latticed or fenestrated shell. In the last decade, Radiolarians are reclassified in five taxonomic orders as characterized by the composition and morphology of the mineral skeletons which include Acantharia with strontium sulphate skeleton, Taxopodida with silica skeleton, Collodaria, Nassellaria and Spumellaria with polycystine silica skeleton. Hence, in the current classification Collodaria now has four sister orders instead of having one sister order as in Haeckel's original tree. Collodaria, Nassellaria and Spumellaria are sometimes called the Polycystines for their shared skeleton composition character.  Families within Collodaria  Because most Collodaria species are colonial while others appear to be solitary, Collodaria was once divided into three families based on their lifestyle: Thalassicollidae, Collosphaeridae, and Sphaerozoidea. Thalassicollidae is characterized by solitary cells without a silica skeleton. Collosphaeridae and Sphaerozoidea are distinguished from each other based on the morphology of the silica skeleton. In 2012, Ishitan and colleagues performed a phylogenetic analysis and found four novel Collodaria sequences which supported the division of Collodaria into four families: Thalassicollidae, Collozoidae, Collosphaeridae, and Collophidae. However, a recent study published by Baird et al. (2015) refuted this division. In a molecular phylogeny constructed by nuclear ribosomal DNA small and large subunits of Collodaria, the skeleton-lacking and spicule-bearing Sphaerozodae, and its sister clades the skeleton-bearing Collosphaeridae and skeleton- lacking Collophidilidae were found to be monophyletic but Thalassicollidae was found to be paraphyletic. To confirm findings, molecular analyses and morphologies of members were observed. Contrary to previous beliefs, species in Collosphaeridae include solitary, colonial species, skeleton-lacking and skeleton-bearing species. Intraspecific variability in silicified skeletal structures was also observed which emphasized the uncertainty in morphology- based classification.

The monumental vase is hollow, with a hole at the bottom, indicating that it was not used as a mixing bowl like regular kraters. At the Dipylon Cemetery, where it was found, kraters marked the graves of men. Decorations occupy the entire vase, separated into registers containing abstract motifs or figural designs in a dark-on-light style. A key-patterned meander fills the top registers, while funerary iconography sits below. The figural scenes describe two of the three parts of a proper burial: a prothesis and an ekphora. A prothesis is the laying out of a body for mourning, and an ekphora is the transportation of the body to the grave. The third step in a burial would be the actual burial of the body or its ashes. The prothesis scene on the Met's Dipylon Krater features standing women with triangular torsos surrounding a prostrate body underneath a checkered burial shroud. The women raise their arms to their head, tearing out their hair as a sign of mourning for the deceased. Abstract geometric motifs and animals fill space in between the figures in a dense style characteristic of the Late Geometric Period. Underneath, the ekphora scene displays warriors with chariots and hourglass- shaped shields transporting the body in a funeral procession. The horses overlap each other without clear distinctions, in a stiff profile featured across the vase. The elaborate procession, complete with soldiers and horses indicates the importance this family placed on a proper burial, a value also featured in canonical Greek texts like the Iliad. The similarity of this vase's iconography to that of the Dipylon Amphora, attributed to the same artist, reveals that the rituals displayed were not isolated but were part of a larger tradition of Greek funerary rites in Geometric Period Athens.

History Use of Spolia at the Odeion of Agrippa in Athens Themistoclean Wall at the Kerameikos. The Persian Wars were waged by the Achaemenid Empire of Persia in an attempt to conquer the Greeks. King Darius I was unsuccessful in his invasion attempt and was followed by his son, Xerxes I, who led the Second Persian Wars which lasted from 480 to 479 BC. Xerxes saw more victories than his father, successfully burning down Athens. Following the Persian Wars the Greek city states were left in disarray. Many buildings, statues, and fortifications of the Greek city states were destroyed. The people of Athens were worried by a return of the Persians, and Themistocles advocated rebuilding the walls before anything else so they decided to act upon this plan. This project was opposed by the Spartans and their Peloponnesian allies alarmed by the increasing power of Athens, arguing that a walled Athens would be a useful base for an invading army, and that the defences of the Isthmus of Corinth would provide a sufficient shield against invaders. The Athenians went ahead to protect themselves from the Peloponnesians;Fine, The Ancient Greeks, 330 Thucydides, in his account of these events, describes a series of complex machinations by Themistocles through which he distracted and delayed the Spartans until the walls were built up high enough to provide adequate protection.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War 1.90‚Äì91 The Themistoclean Wall was completed in 479 BCNeer, Richard T.

On the northern side a wide road, the Dromos, ran through the double-arched Dipylon Gate (also known as the Thriasian Gate) and on to the Platonic Academy a few miles away. After their defeat in the Peloponnesian war in 404 BC the Athenians had to destroy all the walls. However, when democracy was re-established Conon repaired the city walls in 394 BC. Facing the Macedonian invasion in 338 BC, a smaller wall, the Proteichisma, was built in front of the main one as an extra defence. The walls were badly damaged when Sulla besieged and attacked the city in 86 BC. They were eventually rebuilt along some sections by Valerian (253-260 AD).

The elections were held in full by the majority system, 45 deputies were elected in 45 single-member constituencies (previously there were 35 deputies in the Duma) out of 258 candidates. The term of the new Duma will be five years. The elections were held on September 14 on more than 3,500 ballots in the city. The final results were announced on September 16, 2014. 17 deputies from the previous City Duma retained their seats. After processing 100% of the ballots, the leaders of the vote were: 28 people nominated by the United Russia party, 5 by the Communist Party, 1 by the LDPR, 1 by Rodina, and 10 by self-nominees supported by United Russia. Background The elections to the Moscow City Duma in 2014 have a number of innovations in comparison with the previous ones: There was a transition from a mixed to a completely single-mandate system of formation of the Moscow City Duma . The scheme for the election of the Moscow City Duma only in single-mandate constituencies was previously used from 1993 to 2001. The number of deputies with a decrease in their status is increasing. Three quarters of deputies will work on a non-permanent basis. The initiative was strengthened by allowing also to combine the senator's post in the Federation Council from Moscow and the Moscow City Duma deputy. There was an abolition of absentee certificates on the initiative of Sergei Sobyanin. At the same time, this innovation coincided with the return to the regional elections of early voting. The primaries \\"My Moscow\\" were held. As a result, in 45 districts, the party of power, United Russia, nominated only 32 candidates from its ranks, the rest of the public from the primaries. In one district, \\"United Russia\\" did not nominate its candidate. Video surveillance in the elections of the City Duma has not been used before.

She worked as a hairdresser in her father's business but switched to singing after winning a crooning competition on Radio Luxembourg. She joined the Billy Thorburn orchestra and her first record was released in 1938. She was heard weekly on the BBC radio comedy programme Take It From Here. Devon later became a vocalist for the Tito Burns jazz Septet, developing the skill of scat singing. Burns and Devon married in November 1948. She stopped singing professionally and helped her husband to manage notable singers. Biography Early life and career Teresa Devon was born on 19 May 1922 in the East End of London. She was the only child of second generation Russian immigrants Manny and Connie Devon. Manny worked as a hairdresser in Shepherd's Bush. Although Devon won a scholarship to attend a grammar school, she left early to assist in her father's business. After she won a crooning competition on Radio Luxembourg, she changed her career path to singing. At the age of 16, Devon auditioned for the Billy Thorburn orchestra, known as Organ, the Dance Band and Me. He initially considered her too young but recognised her abilities and made her the band's female vocalist. Devon's first record Any Old Hearts to Mend was released in 1938, and her first radio broadcast came the following year. She followed these events by recording two further albums, To Mother With Love and Wish Me Luck As You Wave Me Goodbye. Devon toured with Thorburn in the 1940 revue Ssh‚Ä¶ Keep It Dark. The singer then joined the Oscar Rabin Band as a vocalist and entertained British Armed Forces troops overseas. Devon recalled in her later years the ship she was performing on sailing through minefields and then hitting the pier which separated it into two. After the war, she joined the Keynotes harmony group and broadcast weekly on the BBC radio comedy programme Take It From Here. Devon became a vocalist for the Tito Burns jazz band and developed the skill for scat singing. She sang ballads and her voice was occasionally used instrumentally alongside the trumpet and saxes in arrangements. On occasion, Burns and Devon sang together as a duo in the manner created by the American husband and wife duo Jackie Cain and Roy Kral. Her songs for Decca Records were Be Bop Spoken Here, a duet with Burns, and I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles. She also worked with other bands in this period including Geraldo and toured as a duo with Len Camber. Devon married Burns in November 1948 and the marriage produced two children. Later life and death She helped her husband represent singer Cliff Richard, Searchers and the Zombies and promoted the British tours of Tony Bennett and Victor Borge.

He was a diplomat and enlightenment writer, a Freemason and a friend of the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  Life   Family provenance and early years  Otto Heinrich von Gemmingen-Hornberg was born at the Free imperial city Heilbronn, where his parents were based for a period. His father, also called Otto Heinrich von Gemmingen (1727‚Äì1790), worked as a judge at the imperial district court in Wetzlar, and it was here that he spent the first ten years of his life, receiving his schooling from his father, probably with backup from a tutor. His mother, Marie Elis von Gemmingen-Hornberg (1723-1775), was the widow of Count von Virmont and a daughter of Johann Hermann Franz von Nesselrode. After the death of his grandfather his father gave up his work as a judge in 1766 and the family relocated to Heilbronn. From the lawyerly social milieu in the bustling commercial centre, he would move to a more traditionally aristocratic lifestyle during his earl teenage years, with parties and concerts and fireworks in summer evenings and tobogganing in the winter. It was in this context that the younger Otto Heinrich - generally known as Heinrich in the family - had his first experience of theatre at the \\"Kom√∂diensaal\\" in the town hall, making frequent stage appearances in the works of Lessing, Schiller, Shakespeare and other playwrights fashionable at the time. His father nevertheless continued to place emphasis on more serious aspects of his education. Important for any future career in politics or diplomacy was mastery of the French language, and both French and Jurisprudence featured prominently in his studies. Literature and Music were not ignored, however. Heinrich had access not merely to his father's extensive library but also to the public library in the town, which afforded excellent opportunities for building his knowledge. He also became a competent performer on the 'cello and on the piano. He was a frequent visitor at the home of Gottlob Moriz Christian von Wacks, the longstanding mayor of Heilbronn, by whose wife, Charlotte Sophie von Wacks, a great lover of the arts, Heinrich's own taste was greatly influenced. During these teenage years he also had a brief but intense love affair with Lotte, the daughter of a Heilbronn businessman. His artistic mentor, Charlotte Sophie von Wacks, attempted to end the affair which she believed might obstruct Heinrich's subsequent education. She warned Lotte's mother what was happening. When that failed to have any effect she arranged a meeting between the two fathers. In the end Lotte was persuaded that Heinrich's commitment was not as absolute as she had thought, while Heinrich's father brought forward the date on which the boy should be sent away to pursue his studies. Heinrich von Gemmingen later recycled the experience in his play, \\"Der deutsche Hausvater\\", with which he established his reputation as a dramatist virtually overnight.  Mannheim years  When he was still only 19 he was sent to Mannheim to pursue his legal studies, although he still made frequent returns to Heilbronn where he continued to participate in the drama productions at the town hall. As far as theatre was concerned, the atmosphere in Mannheim was less carefree than in provincial Heilbronn, as the absolutist rulers discouraged scholars and aristocrats from attending theatre. Gemmingen's love for the theatre persisted, however, and Mannheim was changing. Its position on one of Europe's main communication channels, the River Rhine, gave the city quick access to new currents of Enlightenment thinking. He settled quickly into Mannheim society and, after barely half a year in the city, was appointed a chamberlain, although he never showed any appetite for the life of a courtier. In any case, jobs of this nature disappeared when the royal court left Mannheim for Munich in 1778 after Charles Theodore, the Prince-Elector, inherited the Bavaria. Meanwhile, Gemmingen continued to read extensively and to profit from the cultural opportunities provided by Mannheim and nearby Schwetzingen. He attended and was deeply affected by a performance of what was said to be the first opera sung in the German language. Around this time he took the decision to devote his free time to learning how to become a writer. He wanted to be able to use these skills to enlighten and, in the words of one source, to liberate the simple people from ignorance. Meanwhile, in or before 1777 he became a Hofkammerrat in Mannheim, which cemented his membership of society and gave him oversight over education and schools, which also extended to the National Theatre Mannheim (a set of duties from which Gotthold Ephraim Lessing had just resigned). This position was worth 950 Gulden per month plus bonuses.  Mozart friendship  Mozart arrived in Mannheim at the start of his second visit to the city on 30 October 1777. Gemmingen and the composer quickly got to know one another and to value each other's company. They shared a love of music and a passion for the theatre. Together they worked on \\"Semiramis\\", an opera which is believed subsequently to have been lost (and may very well never have been completed). Mozart mentions Gemmingen a number of times in letters to his father. He writes about their work together on the first act of \\"Semiramis\\" in which the work is described as an \\"opera\\" and then as a \\"duodrama\\". During the next few months Mozart and Gemmingen were frequently seen out and about together, for instance in rehearsals for the Holzbauer opera \\"G√ºnter von Schwarzburg\\". They were seen together on 6 November 1777 when Mozart was presented to the prince-elector, and again on 3 December when Mozart was giving lessons to the (\\"extra-marital\\") four children of the prince-elector born in rapid succession to Josepha Seyffert (who later became the Countess von Heydeck). Although himself a member of the influential \\"Kurpf√§lzischen Deutschen Gesellschaft\\" (\\"Kurpfalz German Society\\") only since 1776, Gemmingen was well known to fellow members, having already given many presentations and lectures to it, and he was able to introduce Mozart to the membership. That led to a number of intense discussions over how the German language might be promoted, at a time when much literature was in French and operas normally had Italian lyrics. There was also discussion over how a German national theatre might be established. On 15 March 1778 Mozart set out on a journey to Paris, accompanied by his mother. He had already been obliged to sell his own carriage to finance the trip, and Gemmingen was able to improve the quality of his journey, providing three gold \\"Louis d'or\\" coins, \\"to repay the expense of writing out the music\\" of a recently composed quartet.  National theatre  Meanwhile, the national theatre project became a reality and on 1 September 1778 Wolfgang Heribert von Dalberg was appointed intendant of the National Theatre in Mannheim. A permanent theatre company was created, headed up by August Wilhelm Iffland. The first production was presented on 7 October 1779 and within a few years Mannheim became one of the leading theatres in Germany. The premier of The Robbers on 13 January 1782 was a huge success with the public, marking as it did the public launch of the career of a new playwright, Friedrich Schiller. The success also made the National Theatre itself a cultural focus for intellectual elites. In recognition of his contribution to launching and sustaining the theatre project Heinrich von Gemmingen zu Hornberg was invited to assume oversight of dramaturgy. He also became a frequent and committed theatre critic. In 1779 it became apparent that he had also been working on a play of his own. Meanwhile, early in July 1778, news came through that Mozart's mother had died suddenly while accompanying her son in Paris. Mozart returned to Mannheim where Gemmingen showed him the translation he was working on of Rousseau's Pygmalion, and discussed his plans for translating Shakespeare's Richard III. However, Mozart received a forceful letter from his father, dated 9 December 1778, ordering him urgently back to Vienna. There was no question of disobeying his father, but Mozart gave free rein to his anger.  Success with \\"Hausvater\\"  In 1779 Gemmingen revisited the thwarted love affair of his youth with his performance piece \\"Der deutsche Hausvater\\" (loosely: \\"The German house father\\"). The play was presented in the Autumn/Fall before the \\"Kurpf√§lzischen Deutschen Gesellschaft\\" (\\"Kurpfalz German Society\\"). It was consciously and unusually political, denouncing the division between aristocracy and bourgeoisie, and the treatment of the peasantry by both. Gemmingen used the piece as a passionate attack on class barriers. The audience included both friends and critics - those who had criticised him in the past for excessive restraint and vagueness. At the end of the first reading, resounding applause broke out. Apprehension on the part of some of the aristocratic audience members could not prevent the piece becoming a success. The actor manager Friedrich Ludwig Schr√∂der (who later became a personal friend), immediately accepted the play for his company, and headed up the first performance at Hamburg on 4 October 1779. Within a few months \\"Der deutsche Hausvater\\" was enjoying long runs in Munich, Hamburg, Berlin, Vienna, Prague and a number of smaller cities. It was even translated into Italian. Friedrich Schiller, whose own later play Intrigue and Love was clearly influenced by \\"Hausvater\\", wrote effusively to Wolfgang Heribert von Dalberg at the National Theatre, with warm words to be passed to the author of the work.  Freemasonry  It is believed that Gemmingen joined the freemasons around 1779 when he was 24. He had connections with several lodges, not just in Mannheim itself but also in Heidelberg, Worms and Vienna. There are also indications that he introduced the young Mozart to freemasonry during the composer's time in Mannheim, although there is no firm evidence for this. It is probable that Gemmingen became a member of the Carl zur Eintracht lodge in Mannheim in 1779, some 23 years after its establishment, which came under the direction of the Grand Lodge of Prussia called Royal York for friendship. He appears already to have reached the degree of \\"Master\\" by 1782 when he relocated to Vienna where, between 1782 and 1787, he was regarded as one of the city's leading Freemasons.  Marriage  His court appointment involved working in the Schwetzingen Palace, and Gemmingen therefore took rooms in the palace \\"for reasons of economy\\" (as he wrote to his father). This meant regularly dining at the Prince-elector's table, and in the palace grounds he frequently met the Countess Palatine accompanied by her ladies in waiting. One of these was the Countess Charlotte von Sicklingen (1756‚Äì1826). Gemmingen and Charlotte married on 8 September 1779. Shortly afterwards the couple were temporarily separated when the Prince-elector acquired Bavaria and moved the court to Munich. Gemmingen moved with the court. The Prince-elector's wife, the Countess Palatine remained in Mannheim, however, together with her ladies in waiting. In Munich Gemmingen oversaw the first Munich productions of \\"The Inheritance\\" and \\"The House-father\\", which had to be adapted for Bavarian conditions. However, in 1780 he was able to return to Mannheim for the birth of his first son.  Move to Vienna: enlightenment years  In 1781 oversight of schools was transferred from Gemmingen's remit to the Catholic Church, hampering Gemmingen's ambitions to implement Enlightenment values in Bavaria. Gemmingen resigned his position and moved to Vienna, where he hoped to be able to progress his goals under more favourable conditions. In November 1780 Emperor Joseph II had begun his sole rule and pursued Enlightenment ideals in the Habsburg monarchy, unencumbered by his mother's pragmatic conservatism. In Vienna Gemmingen received a friendly welcome: it is possible that his friend Mozart had prepared the ground for his arrival. He quickly gained access to the household of the Princess of Thun, who was exceptionally well connected in literary and musical circles. In her house he would have met members of the nobility, writers and musicians. The emperor himself, arriving incognito, was also a frequent visitor. Friedrich M√ºnter wrote that Gemmingen \\"was very influential in the background through his connections with Prince Kaunitz, Swieten and the Princess of Thun. Backed by other influential freemasons, Gemmingen tried to support Joseph II's policy of reform, using his contributions to the weekly political journals \\"Weltmann\\" and \\"Wahrheiten\\" for which, in 1783, he became editor. As editor, he continued to write many of the articles himself, using the pseudonym \\"O. H. Edler von Hoffenheim\\", a reference to the estate at Hoffenheim which his father had inherited in 1781. There were contributions from other freemasons, and some of the ideas of the \\"Illuminati\\" (of whom he evidently became one) also found a resonance in the journals. However, his publications attracted hostility in aristocratic and, more particularly, church circles. One article Gemmingen published appeared under the headline, \\"Dabei schaffe sich der Mensch zwischen sich und Gott Mittelwesen, wobei er √ºber diese Gott vergisst\\" (\\"Thus mankind creates intermediaries, while forgetting about God\\"). Another was headed \\"Schutzpatrone, Heilige √ºberhaupt und besonders Maria: Was sind dies anderes als Mittelwesen? ‚Ä¶ Noch ein allgemeiner Zug des Aberglaubens ist die √ºbertriebene Verehrung des Priestertum.\\" (\\"Protectors, saints in general and the Blessed Mary in particular: These are nothing more than intermediaries - one more piece of pressure to honour the priests excessively\\").  Freemasonry in Vienna and its divisions  During Gemmingen's time in Vienna, the city's energetic masonic community struggled with the appearance of the \\"Strict Observance\\" movement, which Gemmingen opposed because of the enhanced role it gave to \\"occult mysticism\\". Gemmingen supported the creation of a new lodge, respecting the older obligations and the differenatiation between the difference degrees (ranks) of members, along with backing for Enlightenment values and support for the Emperor's reforms by word and deed. Gemmingen himself became Master of the new Lodge, which took its principles from an earlier group, the Lodge of true concord. Soon afterwards he became the district lodge secretary for Vienna, with the mandate to draft up some constitutional statutes. It was under these statutes that on 22 April 1784 the Austrian Grand Lodge was set up under the leadership of Prince Dietrichstein. This was seen as a great achievement on Gemmingen's part. By the end of 1784 the \\"lodge of philanthropy\\" (\\"Loge Zur Wohlt√§tigkeit\\") comprised around 40 members. A highlight was the recruitment of Mozart, after the composer became aware that Gemmingen was a member of the at that time secret organisation.  Setbacks  After he had been appointed editor in chief of \\"W√∂chentlichen Wahrheiten f√ºr und √ºber die Prediger in Wien\\" (\\"Weekly Truths for and about preachers in Vienna\\") in 1783 and, at about the same time, taken charge of \\"Der Weltmann\\", which was if anything less restrained in discussing church matters, Gemmingen found himself on the receiving end of attacks from Leopold Alois Hoffmann, founder of \\"W√∂chentlichen Wahrheiten\\" and Gemmingen's predecessor as its editor in chief. Gemmingen's editorial appointments had been made in response to \\"orders from on high\\", which seems to refer to behind the scenes string pulling on the part of the Emperor himself. But now it was Hoffmann who complained that fees due to him had not been paid and promises had not been kept. In fact, Gemmingen had taken care to ensure that Hoffmann received a dispensation meaning that, despite his relative youth, he could become a member of the \\"lodge of good deeds\\" (\\"Loge Zur Wohlt√§tigkeit\\"). He also employed Hoffmann as his secretary, and used his influence with his friend Swieten to see to it that Hoffmann received a post as a professor at the University of Pest. In later years Hoffmann acquired a reputation as a leading critic in the media of freemasonry. It is possible that even in 1784 his hostility to Gemmigen was conflated with a negative view of the movement. It is also possible that after publication of \\"W√∂chentlichen Wahrheiten\\" ended on 10 June 1784, Gemmingen could no longer justify (or afford) retaining Hoffmann as his secretary, and Hoffmann's subsequent attacks were a form a \\"pay back\\". Since 1783 or earlier Gemmingen had been thinking that the weekly political journals for which he was responsible, targeted on members of the upper classes, were too restricted in their appeal, and in 1784 he launched \\"Magazin f√ºr Wissenschaften und Literature\\" (\\"Magazine for Sciences and Literature\\"), intended to appeal to the growing ranks of Vienna's bourgeoisie. However, by 1785 this project was abandoned, having failed to interest its intended readership. One source speculates that it was pitched \\"at too high a level\\". In 1784 financial pressures drove Gemmingen to try and obtain a position at court, but in this he was not successful. Shortly afterwards, on 22 August 1784, he was placed under police surveillance, and his written work was subjected to censorship for the first time. He made one more attempt to launch a political journal with a more popular appeal, this time under the title \\"Vienna Ephemeris\\". This fared better than his earlier attempt, and was published till 1787, the year in which he left Vienna. Gemmingen's departure from Vienna was sudden and largely unexplained. There are suggestions that he had made too many enemies in the city. He certainly faced financial challenges. These arose in connection with the indebtedness of his brother-in- law, Franz von Sickingen. Gemmingen's wife was certainly always very close to her brother whose approach to his finances seems to have been excessively \\"easy going\\".  Inheritance  Gemmingen's father died on 3 February 1790 and he moved with his family into the patrimonial estate at Hoffenheim, between Heidelberg and Heilbronn. Six weeks later, on 26 March 1790, he issued an \\"Ordinance\\" which reads like a cross between the constitution for a small state and a set of instructions to his tenants. The details in this prescriptive document are characterised by practical attention to detail worthy of a German product of the enlightnement. Sources are silent over the implementation phase of the Hoffenheim Ordinance, but by the end of 1790 Gemmingen had sold the Hoffenheim estate to his younger brother, Sigmund, for 40,000 Gulden. On 11 May 1791 he purchased an estate at nearby Maudach, on the farther bank of the Rhine, for 36,000 Gulden. In an age before railroads and motorways the river was the principal transport artery for the region, and his new estate was less than an hour away from Mannheim, Heidelberg, Schwetzingen and Speyer. Gemmingen moved in with his family, spending a lot of time in Mannheim on the opposite bank. However, in 1795 the French revolution came to his Maudach estate, the \\"revolutionary army\\" badly damaging the estate and destroying part of his book collection. With his brother-in-law Franz von Sickingen he now exchanged the Maudach property for an estate at M√ºhlbach near Karlstadt am Main which was in a slightly less exposed position with regard to marauding armies, and which he had inherited via his wife.  Back to Vienna  In 1799 Gemmingen was sent on a special mission to Vienna on behalf of the court. In Vienna his initial reception was cool. Enlightenment principals had lost their appeal in the light of the French Revolution and the Emperor Joseph had died in 1790, but there were many in the political establishment who still remembered Gemmingen from his time in Vienna during the 1780s. However, his diplomatic skills soon won him recognition at the court. The Margrave of Baden was more than pleased with his performance and appointed him a permanent plenipotentiary to the Court at Vienna, for which he received annual remuneration of 22,000 Gulden. With Napoleon's decisive victory at Austerlitz, Baden benefitted substantially from the French empoeror's favour, its territory substantially enlarged as it became the Grand Duchy of Baden, a development in which Gemmingen played his part.  Final years  After 1806 Gemingen returned to M√ºhlbach with his family, spending the last three decades of his life away from public life and increasingly impoverished. His high level of indebtedness may have resulted from excessive cash transfers and guarantees on behalf of his impecunious brother in law. He then attempted to increase his income by increasing the charges on the tenant farmers on the estates. This met with particularly strong resistance at Hoffenheim where at one stage troops had to be called in and set on the tenants. His own financial difficulties led him to forget earlier backing for unjustly treated peasants. In 1817, the estate at M√ºhlbach had to be given up and he moved back, briefly, to Hoffenheim, and then to Heidelberg where, in 1819, he was obliged to file for bankruptcy. When the data were computed he was found to have debts in excess of 200,000 Gulden and the Mannheim High Court was obliged to intervene. His wife died in 1826, and he died ten years later, completely impoverished. He retained only a small collection of books. During his final years this once esteemed enlightenment writer and diplomat fell into a level of obscurity from which his reputation has not yet recovered.

It is located on the spot where Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico was executed 19 June 1867, and dedicated to his memory.  History  The initial monument with three columns mark the spot where Maximilian and two of his generals were executed. Later the chapel was built on the spot. The hill on what was formerly the outskirts of Quer√©taro was the site of the end of the Second Mexican Empire. After being intercepted by the republican generals on May 15, 1867, the emperor, who had been besieged in the central city of Quer√©taro since March, surrendered on the mountain to General Mariano Escobedo. He was jailed on the mountain along with his two generals: Miguel Miram√≥n, who had been the president of Mexico for most of 1859 and 1860, and Tom√°s Mej√≠a Camacho, a Quer√©taro-born cavalry general. After a court-martial in Quer√©taro in which all three were sentenced to death, the sentence was carried out atop the hill on June 19, 1867, when Maximilian, Miram√≥n and Mej√≠a were executed. The site was initially marked with piles of stone topped by crosses made of sticks; later, wooden crosses were placed on the site, which are now housed in the Cerro de las Campanas Museum. In 1886, the first monument was constructed on the site: three stone columns engraved with the names of the deceased, surrounded by iron bars supported by wooden columns, commissioned by Governor . The altar of the chapel In 1900, after diplomatic relations between Mexico and Austria-Hungary resumed, the chapel was constructed on the site. Commissioned by Emperor Franz Joseph I in memory of his late brother and designed by architect Maximiliano Mitzel, the chapel was dedicated on April 10, 1901. It is designed in an eclectic Viennese style. The altar and altarpiece were made at the Quer√©taro School of Arts and Crafts, and the cross on the altar is taken from the SMS Novara, the ship on which Maximilian and his wife Charlotte of Belgium arrived in Mexico and which transported his remains back to Austria. He was laid to rest in the Imperial Crypt. In January 2017, the Quer√©taro municipal government announced it would invest nearly 1 million pesos for the restoration and maintenance of the chapel.

The game takes place in Sydney, Australia. Plot In the city of Sydney in Australia, a retired detective has been kidnapped. The detective's niece looks for leads to rescue him. Gameplay The gameplay is simplified without the need to click on any verbal commands or items in an inventory. The player interacts with the current area by hovering the mouse over particular objects or any people present and left clicking to perform an action. The mouse pointer changes to an icon that matches the appropriate action. Right clicking cycles through any available items the player possess. Left clicking while holding the selected item uses it. Whenever the player leaves a starting area, the game switches to an over world map of Sydney, allowing the player to travel to any known locations to progress. Development Brendan Reville was inspired by many story-driven Sierra and LucasArts adventure games to create his own, and distanced his title from other FMV video games instead hoping to make a first- person adventure game that happened to be photographed and filmed on location. He started the creation of the game from scratch in the year 2000. He programmed the entire game engine AGE (Adventure Game Engine), but much work had the project in progress for three years. In addition to coding the engine, Reville almost singlehandedly designed the game, photographed and filmed all live action sequences, scripted the game, compiled and created the art, video and sound, programmed the puzzles, recorded the dialogue, tested the game, made a demo, created an installer, built the website, and did PR. The game's budget was around $500. By Monday 9 September 2002, Brendan had presented his game to the Independent Games Festival. Filming Filming of the game was done in the very plot-centered city Sydney itself around 17 different locations with over 240 scenes in total. Capturing pictures was done using a wide-angled SLR Camera provided by Shanno Sanders. Paul Fiore also lent a digital video camera which was used together with a Shotgun microphone for quality filming. Due to the low-budget, the cast of 11 actors were either friends or friends-of-friends of Reville, and only one cast member had previous acting experience. Reception Michelle Whicker of PC Gameworld argued that the game could be used as a public relations marketing tool for Sydney due to its use of several scenic locations throughout the city. Meanwhile, Alex Tait of Just Adventure described the game as the equivalent of buying a CD based on hearing one song on the radio only to be disappointed, and thought its unintentional humour was stylistically to that found in The Curse of Monkey Island and The Feeble Files.

Zaunius received only primary education and earned a living off his farm in An Rokaiten. He supported publication of Lithuanian books and their smuggling across the Prussian‚ÄìRussian border. Lithuanian-language books printed in the Latin alphabet were banned in Lithuania which was then part of the Russian Empire (see Lithuanian press ban). His farm welcomed various Lithuanian activists who were persecuted by the Tsarist authorities for violations of the ban or other political activities. Linguist Georg Sauerwein lived on the farm for a year and composed the poem Lietuvininkai we are born. Between 1887 and 1903, Zaunius was elected as chairman of the Birutƒó Society several times. However, his tenure marked periods of low activity and the society came close to being liquidated in 1903. In 1900, Zaunius and his daughter Morta were entrusted with managing the budget for the Lithuanian exposition at the world's fair in Paris. He also managed the budget of the Lithuanian newspaper Varpas from 1900 to 1905. Zaunius also organized a library at his farm. It sought to collect all Lithuanian publications. Some of this collection was donated to the Lithuanian Scientific Society in Vilnius, the rest was lost during World War II. In 1890, together with Martynas Jankus, Jonas Smalakys, and others, Zaunius established the first of the Lithuanian Conservative Election Societies.

One of her ancestors on her father's side, William Hinkle, came to America with William Penn, with whom he was closely associated in the affairs of the colony of Pennsylvania. On her mother's side, Elizabeth Walter, her ancestors were Hollanders. Rachel Hinkle descendeded from Edward Marshall of Tinicum Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, one of the participants in the Walking Purchase of 1737. Her parents were farmers. Rachel lived on the homestead farm until she was twenty years old. She was the youngest of five children. In childhood she displayed a talent and liking for recitation. Her early education was such as the public schools gave in those days, and later she attended the State Normal School in Millersville, Pennsylvania, where, after graduation, she remained as a teacher of English and French. Career Rachel Shoemaker always maintained a connection with the school founded with her husband in some capacity, acting as president when no one else was chosen. She compiled a number of books for elocutionists, and she studied and wrote much upon the subject. She taught thousands of students and read in many cities, including Philadelphia, New York, Cincinnati, Minneapolis, Toronto, Hamilton and Montreal. The school founded by herself and her husband prospered from the beginning and trained some of the most successful readers of the day. Personal life On June 27, 1867, Rachel Walter Hinkle became the wife of Professor Jacob W. Shoemaker (1842-1880). They made their home in Philadelphia, where, in 1875, they opened the National School of Elocution and Oratory and later commenced the publication of elocutionary books.

Dromec, Maxon Motor and Genetrix.  Working principle  The Kitepower system consists of three major components: a lightweight, high-performance kite, a load-bearing tether and a ground-based electric generator. Another important component is the so called kite control unit and together with the according control software for remotely steering the kite. For energy production, the kite is operated in consecutive \\"pumping cycles\\" with alternating reel-out and reel-in phases: during reel-out the kite is flown in crosswind maneuvers (transverse to the incoming wind, commonly figure of eight patterns). This creates a large pulling force which is used to pull the tether from a ground-based drum that is connected to a generator. In this phase electricity is generated. Once the maximum tether length is reached, the kite is reeled back, but this time depowered, such that it can be retracted with a low aerodynamic resistance. This phase consumes a small fraction of the previously generated power such that in total net energy is produced. The electricity is buffered by a rechargeable battery unit, or, in a kite park configuration, several systems can be operated with phase shifts such that the battery capacity can be reduced.  Technology context  Airborne wind energy promises to be a cost-competitive solution to existing renewable energy technologies. The main advantages of the airborne wind energy technology are the reduced material usage compared to conventional wind turbines (no foundation, no tower) which allows reaching for higher altitudes and makes the systems more mobile in terms of location, and considerably cheaper in construction. Challenges are robustness and reliability of the flying wind energy system and the airspace requirements of the technology. A considerable body of scientific literature and patents has been developed.

His daughter, having inherited many of her distinguished father's tastes and ambitions, became his almost constant companion after leaving Miss Carr's celebrated academy on the Old York Road, Pennsylvania.

Career Tillie May Forney wrote for publication from early girlhood, and she then took up the task systematically and wrote regularly for prominent journals, besides acting frequently as her father's amanuensis, both in this country and in Europe. Under his experienced eye she received careful training for the work she preferred above all others. No accomplishment suitable to her sex was neglected in her education. She possesses a voice of unusual range and sweetness, and at that period it was her teacher's wish that all her interest should be centered on her musical talent, but it seemed impossible for her to drop her pen.

He co-founded the New England Anti-Slavery Society, provided legal advice to abolitionists, harbored fugitive slaves in his home, and helped finance the abolitionist newspaper, the Liberator. Loring also mentored Robert Morris, who went on to become one of the first African-American attorneys in the United States.  Early life and career  Loring was born in Boston on April 14, 1803, to James Tyng Loring, a druggist, and Relief Faxon Cookson Loring. He attended the Boston Latin School, and was awarded the school's Franklin Medal for scholarship in 1819. He studied at Harvard, where he was a Phi Beta Kappa member. He was admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1827, and went to work for the Western Railroad Company.  Abolitionism  Loring initially believed that a policy of abolishing slavery gradually, rather than all at once, would attract more supporters to the abolitionist cause. William Lloyd Garrison persuaded him that \\"immediate and unconditional emancipation\\" was the only morally acceptable policy. On January 1, 1831, Loring was one of twelve abolitionists who gathered in the basement of the African Meeting House to found the New England Anti-Slavery Society. He and Oliver Johnson drafted the society's constitution. He was also a member of the financial committee that supported the abolitionist newspaper, the Liberator. Along with David Lee Child and Samuel Edmund Sewall, Loring frequently provided legal advice to abolitionists. In 1836, to appease conservatives who were upset by local activists, Massachusetts governor Edward Everett proposed legislation that would have curtailed the free speech of abolitionists. Along with Garrison and Samuel Joseph May, Loring argued before the joint legislative committee appointed to consider the measure, and persuaded them it was unconstitutional. That same year, he and Sewall successfully argued before the Massachusetts Supreme Court in Commonwealth v. Aves that any slave who was brought to a free state by a slaveholder could not be forced to leave. In the late 1830s, Loring hired a 15-year-old African-American youth named Robert Morris as a household servant. When Loring's regular copyist, a white youth, neglected his duties, Morris took over for him. Impressed with Morris's intellect, Loring tutored him in the law, and in 1847 presented him for admission to the Massachusetts bar. Morris was the second African American to practice law in Massachusetts, and frequently used his legal expertise in the cause of racial justice. Loring was on the Amistad Committee, which organized legal and financial support for the captive Africans in United States v. The Amistad in 1841. He and Lewis Tappan visited the 72-year-old John Quincy Adams at his home and persuaded him to take the case. After the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was passed, Loring joined the Boston Vigilance Committee and opened his home to fugitive slaves. Loring's home was one of the safehouses where Ellen Craft stayed when she was being pursued by Georgia slave catchers that October. In 1851 he was one of the lawyers who defended Shadrach Minkins, a Boston resident who was arrested under the Fugitive Slave Act. When the legal team failed to get Minkins released, a group of activists stormed the courthouse and rescued him. With Richard Henry Dana Jr., Loring defended Robert Morris, Lewis Hayden, and John J. Smith in connection with the rescue.  Personal life  A fifth great grandson of Thomas Loring the immigrantPope, Charles Henry Loring Genealogy. Cambridge, MA: Murray and Emery Co., 1917. (pp. 255-6), Loring married Louisa Gilman in 1827. The couple had one child, Anna, who married the pianist and composer Otto Dresel in 1863. Anna's son, Ellis Loring Dresel, was a lawyer and diplomat who served as attach√© to the U.S. embassy in Berlin. Louisa Loring was a member of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society. A close friend of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Loring influenced Emerson's views on abolitionism and helped with the research for his 1844 address, Emancipation in the West Indies. Loring died on May 24, 1858, after a brief illness. Three days later, William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips eulogized Loring at the New England Anti-Slavery Convention; their remarks were published in the Liberator. The poet John Greenleaf Whittier wrote a tribute to Loring, addressed to their mutual friend Lydia Maria Child.

Life Kim Kyunghu was born in 1971 in Seoul. She graduated from Ewha Woman's University with a degree in German Literature and Language. Later she earned a doctorate in creative writing from Myongji University‚Äôs Graduate School. She began her career in 1998 with the publisher Hyundae Munhak, and published poetry collections Geunal Mali dolaoji anatda (Í∑∏ÎÇ† ÎßêÏù¥ ÎèåÏïÑÏò§ÏßÄ ÏïäÏïòÎã§ The Horse Did Not Return That Day), and Yeoldu gyeobui jajeong (Ïó¥Îëê Í≤πÏùò ÏûêÏ†ï Twelve Layers of Midnight). She won the 61st Hyundae Literary Award in 2016. Writing Kim Kyunghu‚Äôs poetry has attracted attention for simply showing a way of life, where all of the world‚Äôs violence is endured, yet the meaning of life is not given up on until the end. Her first poetry collection Geunal Mali dolaoji anatda (Í∑∏ÎÇ† ÎßêÏù¥ ÎèåÏïÑÏò§ÏßÄ ÏïäÏïòÎã§ The Horse Did Not Return That Day) has shown the way of poetry that does not compromise with the violent reality, using honest words that show the innermost side of a wretched life, instead of words of false reconciliation. Her poetry suggests how one could endure the violence of reality, while also seeking a better life, or another reality.Song, Seunghwan, \\"Forced Silence and the Destruction of Language\\", Sijak, Spring Issue, 2013. Her second poetry collection, Yeoldu gyeobui jajeong (Ïó¥Îëê Í≤πÏùò ÏûêÏ†ï Twelve Layers of Midnight) records the groans of enforced silence of those who do not even have the opportunity to speak out in a violent world. Such silence and groaning comes when the poetry‚Äôs subject, while withstanding the violence of the world, and not giving up on the possibility of entering reality, loses the ability to act on such a possibility. This implies that as the subject grows from a child to an adult, the violence of the world becomes greater. From such a perspective, the pain in the world of Kim Kyunghu‚Äôs poetry is not a metaphor, but closer to reality.Park, Seulgi, \\"The Methodology of Pain, Remembering Unfortunate Meetings\\", Literature and Society, Fall Issue, 2012: 334. On her poetry that has such depth, poet Kim Ki-taek has written in his commentary for the Contemporary Literature (Hyundae Munhak) Award the following. \\"Her poetry circulates and activates delicate emotions and feelings, giving a strangely great amount of joy. What is new in her poetry is not what has been found by resisting, rejecting, and throwing away what is old, but instead it is what has been found by rediscovering what is already abundant yet unseen in the old, and finding the true value and beauty of it, allowing us to feel it vividly.\\"Kim, Ki-taek, \\"Award Commentary\\", The 61st Hyundae Literary Award Poetry Collection, Hyundae Munhak, 2016.

Reinstituted in 1124, the Priory was suppressed in 1415. Anglo-Saxon monastery Earl Alfric, who lived in the reigns of Kings Cnut (Canute), Harold Harefoot, Harthacnut and Edward the Confessor (1016-1066), founded the church or chapel of St. John Baptist in or at Clare Castle and established there seven secular canons. Refoundations This earlier church, with all its endowments, was given in 1090 by Gilbert Fitz Richard de ClareGeorge Cokayne,The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant, Vol. III, Ed. Vicary Gibbs, London 1913, p. 243 to the Benedictine Bec Abbey in Normandy, of which it became a cell. In 1124 his son Richard de Clare, 3rd Lord of Clare (sometimes called Earl of Hereford), moved the monastic community from Clare Castle to Stoke-by-Clare, in Suffolk, located in the valley of the River Stour, about two miles west of Clare. Dependency of Bec Abbey From 1090 and for the rest of its monastic existence, the Priory was a dependency of Bec Abbey, a Benedictine monastic foundation in Normandy, not far from Rouen. Founded in 1034, it became through the magnetic presence of the erudite Lanfranc of Pavia a focus of 11th century intellectual life, which developed further under its second abbot, Anselm. Both Lanfranc and Anselm were considerable international figures and both became in turn Archbishop of Canterbury. So it was that Bec became the most influential monastic centre of the 12th-century Anglo-Norman kingdom.C. Warren Hollister, Henry I, Yale University Press, New Haven, 2001, p. 16. Many of the companions in arms and followers of William the Conqueror supported Bec Abbey, enriching it with extensive properties in England, where Bec possessed in the 15th century several priories, namely, in addition to Stoke-by-Clare, also St Neots, Wilsford, Steventon, Cowick, Ogbourne, and at some point also Blakenham Priory and Povington Priory. Bec also had Goldcliff Priory in Monmouthshire.cf. Marjorie M. Morgan, The Suppression of the Alien Priories, in History NS 26, 103 (1941) 208 The London suburb of Tooting Bec takes its name from the medieval village having been a possession of Bec Abbey. An uncertain existence Stoke-by-Clare Priory, as an alien priory, remained down the years in an uneasy situation in the eyes of the English crown. Repeatedly, not least during the Hundred Years' War, the priory‚Äôs revenues were wholly or in part diverted to the English crown. Among other grants, the priory received the right to hold a Thursday market at Stoke, and a yearly fair of three days at the feast of St John the Baptist. From the founding family, the monks had received, in addition to lands, mills, fishing, and pasturing rights, and the advowsons of over ten churches. Moreover, the privileges received repeated confirmations from the Bishops of Norwich and London, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, or from various popes. Although many of the numerous grants of land, rents, and the like, were of small value, others were worth more, such as the churches of Bradley, Little Bradley, Little Bunstead, Bunstead and Stamborne. In 1291 it had rents from 17 parishes to an annual value of ¬£30 14s. 7¬Ωd, plus considerable lands and rents in Essex, and a small amount in Norfolk, yielding a total income of ¬£53 13s. 3d. Upon the death of Prior John Huditot in 1391, Robert Braybrooke (Bishop of London) and William (prior of Ogbourne, who had been authorized by Pope Boniface IX to act for the abbot of Bec in the case of dependent English houses) presented Richard de Cotesford, an English monk of the house, to the Henry le Despenser, Bishop of Norwich, to succeed as prior, with the assent of the king, who was acting patron since the heir of the Earl of March was at the time a minor. Despite this apparently positive turn of events, other developments proved less advantageous. Already in 1379 Richard II made a grant in favour of his uncle, Thomas de Woodstock, Earl of Buckingham, of ¬£60 from priory funds to help to maintain his rank as an earl (Thomas was a son of King Edward III of England). In June 1395, another grant was made towards the expenses of the king's war with France, amounting to all the priory‚Äôs annual income. It was the next month, however, that the priory had enough high ranking support to secure another advantage, becoming denizen, i.e. naturalised. Unfortunately, to obtain this from the crown, Prior Richard Cotesford, had to pay 1,000 marks, at the rate of 100 marks a year, towards the building programme at Westminster Abbey.'Colleges: Stoke by Clare', in A History of the County of Suffolk: Volume 2, ed.

Another requirement was that the priory‚Äôs monks were in future all to be of English birth, and payments of any kind to any foreign abbey were excluded.Alien houses: Priory of Stoke by Clare, in A History of the County of Suffolk, vol. 2, London 1975, pp. 154-155.

Suppression Despite its cost, developments in English national politics meant this new status did not last long. As part of the process sometimes called the Dissolution of the Alien Priories, in 1415 the Priory was suppressed on the proposal of the patron, Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, to the benefit of the new Stoke College, intended to be a college of secular canons. The project gained the approval of a bull from the antipope John XXIII (1410‚Äì1415), regarded at the time by England as the legitimate pope, and was ratified by Pope Martin V, the universally acknowledged pope from 1417. These turbulent papal politics would at least part explain why the first charter of foundation was not sealed by the earl until 9 May 1419.Clive Burgess and Martin Heale, ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Late Medieval English College and its Context‚Äô‚Äô, - Boydell & Brewer, Woodbridge, 2008, pp. 80, 83.

Plot Gene Autry is a private investigator for a banking association, on the trail of two bank robbers, Al Bartlett and Trot Lucas. Bartlett and Lucas waylay Larry Taylor, a doctor on his way to the town of White Water to treat a train engineer who was wounded by the bank robbers, and Taylor's assistant, Helen Ellis. Stealing the couple's horses, they leave them stranded. Autry rides out from White Water heading towards Los Robles, where the doctor was summoned from, to see what is keeping him. Coming upon the couple, he lets Larry ride Champion, Autry's horse, into White Water to get help, while he stays with Helen for protection. Larry returns shortly and the three ride into White Water. In Los Robles, Helen's father, a prospector, enlists the help of a local assayer, Ben Luber, to evaluate the quality of some ore he has extracted. Ben tells Tom Ellis that he will need mining equipment to mine the ore, and his willing to lend him the money for it, in exchange for an interest in the mine. Ben and his brother, Carl, are partners with Bartlett and Lucas. When they go up to the hideout of the two bank robbers, they see Autry approaching, trying to track down the two bandits. Ben releases the two horses which were stolen from Doc Taylor and Helen, which Autry takes off after. Ben and Carl follow, and overpower Autry, who they accuse of stealing the horses, and take him into Los Robles. Autry is quickly cleared, and enlists the help of an old friend, Mike, to continue the search outside of town for Bartlett and Lucas. While camping out that night, they see Ben driving back into town late at night. The following day, Autry publicly confronts Ben about his trip the previous night. Flustered, Ben makes up a story about two of his horses being stolen (which he has actually taken up to Lucas and Bartlett). When Sheriff Phillips raises a posse to go after the non-existent thieves, Ben sends them in the wrong direction. When Autry refuses to join the posse, Phillips has him put in jail for safe-keeping, until the posse returns. However, Bartlett robs the town's bank since the sheriff is away, and Helen witnesses it and follows him to his hideout in the hills. Autry is released from jail, so he can track the bank robber. He arrives at Bartlett's cabin in the hills just as Helen is discovered. In the ensuing gunfight Bartlett kills his brother and Lucas, thinking that his dead brother's body will pass for him. When Kitty shows up to identify Bartlett's body, claiming to be his wife, Autry figures out that the dead man is not Bartlett. Ben, knowing where Bartlett is now hiding out, offers to turn him in for the reward, but Bartlett figures out the doublecross and kills Ben. Autry and Tom Ellis ride after Bartlett, catching up to him as he boards a train in an attempt to escape. Bartlett is killed, and Autry allows Helen and Tom to have the reward money.

John Englund was given the nod to direct in April. Despite the earlier announcement, the filming did not begin until the end of April. After it opened, the National Legion of Decency gave it an \\"A\\" rating: \\"morally unobjectionable for general patronage. Reception Motion Picture Daily (MPD) gave the film a somewhat favorable review, enjoying Autry's performance, and complimenting the rest of the cast on their acting. They felt it would please his fans, but was a bit short on action, however when the action did come it was well done and very realistic. Variety enjoyed the film slightly more, saying it compared favorably with more run-of-the-mill \\"oaters\\" (a film industry term for westerns). Unlike MPD, they felt the picture stressed action more so than Autry's other films. They singled out the work of the supporting cast, in particular enjoying the performances of Kenne Duncan, Pat Buttram, Lynne Roberts, Edward Norris, and Alan Hale Jr.. They praised English's direction, complimenting his handling of the action, as well as the camerawork of William Bradford.

Writing  From his early works, Moon In-soo well showed his ability for in depth observation and thoughts on nature and objects. His observations and thoughts gave rise to a style of poetry that is speculative and meditative. He writes poetry in a controlled and compressed manner, with rich lyricism in the background, which results in a short form of poetry. Therefore, in a traditional sense, he can be called a lyric poet. Meanwhile, his poetry also includes criticism for materialism and endless sympathy for those cast out from the modern society. Recently, through (Îã¨Î∂Å), he has borrowed from the form of sijo, showing more of his capacity for poetry in laying out his skills in compression and control. In his most recent collection (ÎÇòÎäî ÏßÄÍ∏à Ïù¥Í≥≥Ïù¥ ÏïÑÎãàÎã§ I'm Not Here Now), through the concept of 'cheerfulness', he is exploring the path for positivity on life.

She was given the nickname Teufelsschiff (\\"Devil's Ship\\") because she was involved in three serious collisions with other craft and was said to have sunk more German ships than the Danish navy during the Second Schleswig War.  History  The Stadt Z√ºrich, like her sister ship, the Thurgau, was one of the largest and most powerful flush deck steamers on Lake Constance; these ships beginning their service in the mid-1850s. In 1870, the Stadt Z√ºrich underwent her first conversion.By then the ship had apparently already been rechristened; by contrast, Karl F. Fritz dated its renaming 14 years later. In 1884, the ship was converted to be the first half saloon steamer of the Swiss Northeastern Railway fleet and was called, from then on, the Z√ºrich. She was used until the First World War period.Karl F. Fritz 1990, p. 28 Following the scrapping of the Z√ºrich in Romanshorn her paddles were re-used on the paddle steamer, Pilatus from Lucerne.  Accidents  The Stadt Z√ºrich caused \\"fear and terror\\" on Lake Constance as the result of three serious collisions in the period from 1860 to 1864, which earned her the nickname \\"Devil's Ship\\" (Teufelsschiff).Anton Heer. \\"Erst Z√ºrich, dann der Saentis\\". In Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, Jan 2014.  Collision with the K√∂nigin von W√ºrttemberg  On 10 March 1860 the Stadt Z√ºrich rammed the right paddlebox of the K√∂nigin von W√ºrttemberg (\\"Queen of W√ºrttemberg\\") off the town of Friedrichshafen. Nobody was killed, but considerable damage was caused.Bodensee-Hefte, Vol. 3, Issues 7‚Äì8, p. 250  Sinking of the Ludwig  On 11 March 1861, almost a year after her first accident, the Stadt Z√ºrich collided with the steamer Ludwig around 18.15 hours in darkness and driving snow. In 1838, the Ludwig had been the first ship on Lake Constance to have a steel monocoque hull (Rumpfschale), but by this time she was relatively old. The captain, who was to have managed the transfer service between Lindau and Rorschach on the day of the accident, had delayed departure until late afternoon due to a severe storm, in order to avoid the worst squalls. This meant though that he had to steer a compass course in poor visibility. The white bow light of the Stadt Z√ºrich approaching from Rorschach was assumed by the crew of the Ludwig to be part of Rorschach's harbour lighting. Meanwhile, nobody on the Stadt Z√ºrich appears to have noticed the iron steamer, but only realised after the collision that the bowsprit was broken and that water was entering the ship. As a result, the Stadt Z√ºrich turned around and returned to Rorschach Harbour, while the Ludwig, unnoticed by her collision partner, sank within a few minutes. Thirteen men and eleven head of cattle died in this accident, making the sinking of the Ludwig by the Stadt Z√ºrich the most serious shipping accident known at that time that had happened on Lake Constance. One consequence of the investigations into the disaster was an improvement in the signal regulations: in addition to the white bow light a green starboard and a red port light had to be carried.Karl F. Fritz 1990, p. 33.Karl F. Fritz, Vom Raddampfer zur Wei√üen Flotte: Geschichte der Bodenseeschifffahrt, Erfurt: Sutton, 2013, p. 18.  Sinking of the Jura  After the Bavarian ship, the Ludwig had sunk, the Jura was bought as a replacement, a ship which hitherto had worked on Lake Neuch√¢tel. She was dismantled, transported to Lake Constance on carts, reassembled there and taken into service. On 12 February 1864, a foggy winter's day, the Jura was meant to sail from Konstanz to Romanshorn and Lindau. In the opposite direction, however, steamed the Stadt Z√ºrich. Although each of the two ships had fog lookouts and were blowing their steam whistles as a signal, they could not avoid a collision. The Jura was being brought about when the bow of the Stadt Z√ºrich stove into her, killing the fog lookout of the Jura. A waitress and the engine driver of the Jura went down with the steamer, which sank within four minutes. The remaining crew and all the passengers of the Jura were saved by the Stadt Z√ºrich, which was able to proceed safely to Romanshorn, despite her buckled bow.A. Deichert.

Collision with the Stadt Lindau  A few months after the sinking of the Jura the Stadt Z√ºrich slit open a paddle box on the Stadt Lindau in Lindau Harbour. A Bavarian correspondent sarcastically commented that the ship should be sold to Denmark as it had already sunk more German ships than the entire Danish navy.Karl F.

Reid of Chipchase Castle; Milburn would only have been about 18 at the time, if this tradition is correct. The museum catalogue entry for his pipes states that they subsequently belonged to his grandson Lewis Proudlock. The statement is incorrect in detail, for while Proudlock's mother was a Milburn, she was not Muckle Jock's daughter; it seems almost certain that they were related, however. Although Muckle Jock's pipes survive, unfortunately there is no direct evidence of the music he played on them. These pipes were used as a model for new instruments, made by James Robertson of Edinburgh, during the revival of the Border pipes in the 1920s ‚Äì such an instrument is shown at. These were given a different drone configuration from the original, however; Milburn's pipes had a bass drone, together with two tenors an octave above it, while the Robertson pipes had a bass, a baritone drone a fifth higher, and a tenor at the octave. Muckle Jock was described by Dr. Edward Charlton, who knew him, as \\"one of the last of the old Borderers\\", \\"a gigantic man ... as famous for the power of his lungs, as for his prowess in clearing a fair or emptying a keg of whisky\\". Charlton later wrote of him remembering more than once clearing the Bellingham Fair ground, with the Tarset and Tarretburn men at his back, to the old border cry of \\"Tarset and Tarretburn, Hard and heather-bred, YET-YET-YET!\\". A later account, makes clear that such a cry was the likely prelude to a fight. His association with the people of the Tarset area suggests that Muckle Jock originally came from Upper North Tynedale, towards the Border, rather than Bellingham itself. Muckle Jock claimed descent from a Border Reiver, Barty of the Comb, and told this story about him to Charlton, in his Border dialect, closer to Scots than Northumbrian English: \\"My fore-elder, wi' twa ithers, gaed yence over the Borders to lift sheep on the Scottish side; for the Scottish thieves had harried sair in Tynedale. They gaed over by the Coquet heid, and lifted the sheep near Yetholm, and druv them down by Reedwater heid, when the Scots cam after them, three to three. My fore-elders made a stand upon the fell, and the Scots cam bravely up. Ane of our side fell at the first fore gathering, and anither was wounded; but ane of the Scots fell too. My fore-elder was then sore beset with the twa Scots, till he gat a straik at them with his swaird, and garred his heid spang alang the heather like an inion! And then the third Scot tuik aff over the hills, and my fore-elder carried the sheep into Tynedale.\\" A fuller account, with more details, though not in Milburn's words, is given by Charlton in. Muckle Jock died in April 1837, near Bellingham, \\"respected by a large circle of friends\\". He had worked as an auctioneer for 53 years, and was \\"justly celebrated for his judgment of stock\\".

The peace accords agreed upon by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the Colombian government in 2016 provided for the FARC's participation in politics as a legal, registered political party following its successful disarmament. The party was founded after a failed referendum in October 2016 with the majority of Colombian voters voting to reject the peace agreement. The \\"yes\\" campaign to accept the peace negotiations were pushed by President Santos, while the \\"no\\" campaign to reject the agreement was backed by former president √Ålvaro Uribe. The \\"no\\" vote won with 50.2% of the vote. The failed referendum came after four years of peace negotiations. After mild alterations to the peace agreements, the government approved the new deal by pushing it through Congress. This has led to some controversy with those who voted no arguing that the deal offered too much leniency.  Founding Congress  The party's founding congress was held in the Bogota Convention Centre from August 28 to August 31, 2017 with the participation of one thousand delegates, including former FARC militants and members of the Colombian Clandestine Communist Party, as well as some 200 invitees from various sectors of Colombian society and delegations from left-wing groups in other countries, primarily those in Latin America and the Caribbean. The congress concluded on September 1 with the unveiling of the new party in Bogot√°'s Plaza Bol√≠var, with over ten thousand people in attendance. In his speech, party leader Timole√≥n Jim√©nez put forth a proposal for a national transition government for the 2018‚Äì2022 term. The National Directorate is made up of 111 members. In total, 26 women were elected, representing 23% of the new party's leadership. The party's name, chosen to maintain the acronym FARC used by its armed predecessor, was agreed upon on August 31, 2017 during the party's founding congress, prevailing over the other proposed name, Nueva Colombia (\\"New Colombia\\") by 628 votes. The party's logo, a design with a rose and a red star in the center, was revealed at the same time.  Goals  FARC will have 10 automatic seats in Congress through 2026 per the deal reached via the accord. They will continue to attempt to fight poverty and corruption, specifically in rural areas, focusing on land reform. They are looking to form a coalition with other communist groups to gain additional seats in Congress 2018, as they remain ideologically Marxist.  Election results  { class=wikitable - !

The book was first published in 1987; a second edition was published in 2012. It examines the relationship between race and poverty in the United States, and the history of American inner-city ghettos. The broad-ranging book rejects both conservative and liberal arguments for the social conditions in American inner cities. In it, Wilson argues that the decline of such conditions is due to \\"basic economic changes which radically altered the occupational structure of the central cities,\\" such as the withdrawal of large industries from inner cities during the 1970s. He also criticizes the architects of the War on Poverty during the 1960s, saying that they focused too much on poverty as a problem of environment rather than as a problem of \\"economic organization\\". Reception and impact Robert Greenstein wrote that \\"The Truly Disadvantaged should spur critical rethinking in many quarters about the causes and potential remedies for inner city poverty. As policy makers grapple with the problems of an enlarged underclass, they - as well as community leaders and concerned Americans of all races - would be advised to examine Mr. Wilson's incisive analysis.\\" In his review of the book, James Jennings wrote that \\"...despite its important contribution to ongoing public policy debates regarding race and poverty, it falls short of a complete class and racial analysis and still approaches the black urban poor as politically incompetent.\\" In 2001, Mario Luis Small and Katherine Newman described the book as \\"the most important publication in urban poverty over the past twenty-five years.\\" References 1987 non-fiction books University of Chicago Press books Books about poverty Books about race and ethnicity Books by William Julius Wilson American non-fiction books ","title":"The Truly Disadvantaged"},{"id":"55142436","text":"AYNI Social Lab is the social innovation laboratory of the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion of Peru.

Life  Kim Jung-il was an engineering student who had entered Dankook University‚Äôs faculty of engineering in 1996. When he had just come into university, he came across and read poetry collections displayed in the student society room. They were mainly collections of labor poetry, including Park Nohae‚Äôs Nodongui saebyeok (ÎÖ∏ÎèôÏùò ÏÉàÎ≤Ω The Dawn of Labor). He was immediately able to understand it because the poetry had almost no metaphorical devices, and was written in an honest, and passionate language. Kim Jung-il spent much of his childhood and adolescence near Seoul‚Äôs Guro Industrial Complex, and this experience during his youth has had a large influence on his poetry work. In 2002 he began his literary career by winning the Dong-A Daily New Writer‚Äôs Contest in poetry. He has published poetry collections Gukgyeongkkotjib (Íµ≠Í≤ΩÍΩÉÏßë The Border Florist), Amuteun ssi mi-anhaeyo (ÏïÑÎ¨¥Ìäº Ïî® ÎØ∏ÏïàÌï¥Ïöî I‚Äôm Sorry Mr. Anyways), and Naega salagal aram (ÎÇ¥Í∞Ä ÏÇ¥ÏïÑÍ∞à ÏÇ¨Îûå The Person I Will Live As). He has won the 30th Sin Dong-yup Prize for Literature in 2012, and the 3rd Kim Gu-yong Poetry Award in 2013.  Writing  Kim Jung-il has drawn much attention due to his unique poetry where sensual language and fantastic imagery is mixed. In his debut work from 2002 Dong-A Daily New Writer‚Äôs Contest, he connected different images to each other, showing his style of expanding a new meaning, as well as showing his will to use such breaks to shockingly reveal the truths of life. Rather than recreating reality, he uses solid metaphors to depict dramatic situations, telling stories that feel fantastic. However, his rich imagination that freely leaps across reality and fantasy, isn‚Äôt limited to poetic experiments. This is because his poetic imagination is in fact rooted in thorough consciousness against the oppression and violence that society or history exerts on individuals. For example, his most recent poetry collection, Naega salagal aram (ÎÇ¥Í∞Ä ÏÇ¥ÏïÑÍ∞à ÏÇ¨Îûå The Person I Will Live As), is full of works that ask the question ‚Äòwhat is the truth‚Äô to the world. As he soberly perceives our history as a reality full of contradictions blotted by ‚Äòthe history of false tears‚Äô, he also resolves to ‚Äúnever forget what shouldn‚Äôt be forgotten‚Äù, and sincerely expresses his desire to send ‚Äúthe only book that people who have already passed can borrow through the mind‚Äù, to ‚Äúpeople who have lived before me‚Äù, and ‚Äúthe person that I will live as‚Äù. In other words, his works are full of inquiry into the possibility and the means for which poetry and politics can meet.

Belden House is a historic building in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco, California, United States. It was designed by Walter J. Mathews in the Queen Anne style and completed in 1889. Description The house is on Gough Street, facing Lafayette Park. Designed by Walter J. Mathews, a prominent Bay Area architect, it is unusual in San Francisco in being purely Queen Anne in style. It is three stories tall, with a steeply pitched gable roof and two corner turrets with conical roofs; the turrets and the first floor have fish-scale shingles, while the remainder of the house is clad in horizontal siding. The main facade, facing the park, is decorated with carved and plaster areas that have been compared to \\"patterns appliqued on a Victorian sampler\\": the pediment under the gable is richly carved, two sunbursts flank a pair of windows on the third floor, and below an arched window porch on the second floor is a panel with a grinning mythological beast. The house's style has been characterized as \\"[a] full flowering of Queen Anne exuberance\\". History It was built on the lot at number 2004 in 1889 for Charles A. Belden, treasurer of an importing company, whose family lived there until 1900. In 1907 it was purchased by John A. Buck, who had the house at 2010 Gough Street demolished. The Bucks lived there until 1933, after which time it became a home for elderly women. In 1961 the Bucks sold the building to the Hudec Trust; in 1967 it was bought by John Fell Stevenson, a son of Adlai Stevenson II, and his wife, who lived there until 1973. The Bucks added decorative ironwork, and later altered the interior somewhat for retirement home use, including partitioning the third floor, which had originally been an open servants' dormitory and children's play area; the Stevensons made further interior changes. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 11, 1983, at which time its owners were restoring it. Controversy In June 2020, LaFace Skincare CEO Lisa Alexander and her husband Robert Larkin of Raymond James Financial made national news, after a video showing them confronting James Juanillo, who refused to answer on video whether or not he is an owner or renter of the property is one of several renters of the C. A. Belden House. They we‚Äôre accusing him of defacing private property and calling police on him for vandalism by stencilling a Black Lives Matter chalk message on the property front retaining wall, went viral.

It travels and connects Elliott Avenue to the west and Interstate 5 to the east, serving as one of several downtown exits on the freeway. The street carries an average weekday volume of 38,000 vehicles on its central section. Street description Mercer Street begins as Mercer Place, at an intersection with Elliot Avenue West between the Elliott Bay waterfront and Kinnear Park on Queen Anne Hill. The narrow road travels southeast up a short hill to 5th Avenue West, where it turns due east onto West Mercer Street. The street passes through the built-up Lower Queen Anne neighborhood and widens to four lanes at Queen Anne Avenue. Mercer Street continues east through the north part of the Seattle Center, passing the Seattle Repertory Theatre, McCaw Hall, and Memorial Stadium. The street then passes the headquarters of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and gains a protected bike lane on its north side as it passes under Aurora Avenue North (State Route 99). Mercer Street travels east through South Lake Union as a landscaped boulevard with six lanes, passing between the campuses of Amazon.com and Google, to the south and north respectively. The street crosses the path of the South Lake Union Streetcar at Westlake and Terry avenues, just south of Lake Union Park and the Museum of History and Industry. After Fairview Avenue, Mercer enters an interchange with Interstate 5, with direct ramps to the freeway and its reversible express lanes. Several short neighborhood streets in Capitol Hill, Madison Valley, and Washington Park are also named East Mercer Street but are discontinuous from one another. The downtown section of Mercer Street is classified as a major arterial street and is part of the National Highway System, a network of roads identified as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. It is also one of the busiest streets in Seattle, carrying an average weekday traffic volume of 38,000 vehicles between Taylor and Dexter avenues and 66,100 vehicles on the approach to I-5. Its least-traveled section, near Elliott Avenue, carried only 11,000 vehicles on an average weekday in 2016. The street also has a short protected bicycle lane under Aurora Avenue that carries an average of 700 bicyclists per day. W. Mercer Place (red), W. Mercer Street (light blue), Mercer Street, and E. Mercer Street (dark blue) History Mercer Street, named for settler Thomas Mercer, was planned in the early 1860s as part of the initial street grid of Lower Queen Anne. A wagon road along what is now Mercer Street was constructed between Lower Queen Anne and Farm Street (later Aurora Avenue) in 1885. In the 2010s, the Seattle Department of Transportation embarked on a $190.5 million project to widen and improve Mercer Street, which would be restored to bi-directional traffic between Aurora Avenue and Interstate 5. Construction began in September 2010 and the restoration of bi- directional traffic took two years, opening on August 27, 2012. The two-way segment was extended west to 9th Avenue North on May 30, 2014, removing the final section of one-way traffic on Mercer Street, while also permanently closing Broad Street in preparation for the Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel project. On April 27, 2019, a construction crane collapsed onto Mercer Street near its intersection of Fairview Avenue, crushing several cars in the eastbound lanes. At least four people were killed by the collapse.

History and description The original house was built after 1545 by Sir Edward Carne, who had purchased the Ewenny Priory buildings after it had been dissolved by King Henry VIII. The two-storey Tudor mansion had fallen into disrepair by the 1780s. Between 1803 and 1805 a new house was built on the site of the south wing of its Tudor predecessor, with two storeys over a basement, five horizontal bays with a central projecting entrance porch reached by a flight of stone steps. Well known London architect John Nash is put forward as the possible designer. The west wing of the Tudor house was retained and, with other buildings, forms a courtyard to the rear of the main house. An arch leads through the wing. A third storey was added to the west wing in the 1890s. The interior of the main house is well preserved retaining its original features - ornate plasterwork, fireplaces, door frames, and a cantilevered stone staircase in the main entrance hallway. The mansion became a Grade II* listed building in 1963 for its \\"great historic interest of its origins, and for its particularly fine well-preserved interior\\".

Biography  He joined in 1913, during the First World War, and served on patrol boats and submarines. In 1929 he attended the School of War, where he was also promoted. He was appointed frigate captain in 1933 and then commanded the destroyer Le Malin. He was appointed captain of the ship at the beginning of the Second World War. In 1940 and 1941, he commanded the cruiser Georges Leygues, with whom he escaped the British blockade in Gibraltar. He then participated in the fighting in Dakar, in September 1940, against a fleet of Royal Navy ships. He then returned to Algiers where he joined the Allies after the American landing in North Africa of November 8, 1942. After being entrusted with the task of relaunching the activity of the French merchant navy, he was appointed rear admiral in 1943 and, in July of that year, Chief of Staff of the French Navy of the Navy of the newly created French Liberation Committee national and, as such, responsible for the fusion of marine Vichy and free French naval Forces. He contributed to the preparation of the landing of Normandy under the French Army of the Liberation. Initially, the allies envisaged the participation of only a few light French units. Rear-Admiral Lemonnier obtained from Admiral Andrew Cunningham the participation in the combat of the two cruisers Montcalm and Georges Leygues. His participation in the landing of free French naval forces took two different forms: certain vessels provided direct support to the assault by their fire, such as the cruiser Montcalm and Georges Leygues or the torpedo-boat La Combattante, or simply by their sacrifice for the establishment of an artificial shelter (scuttling the Courbet). On the night of 10‚Äì11 June, they had a fairly hard engagement against three light vessels off Guernsey. He prepared for the liberation of Corsica and commanded the French squadron during the landing of Provence in August 1944 . He was appointed vice-admiral in 1944. After the war, he retained his position of Chief of Staff of the Navy but also became director of the NATO Defense College. Between 1951 and 1956, he was the \\"naval deputy\\" of the commander- in-chief of the allied forces in Europe at SHAPE, the NATO command center in Europe, then installed in the Marly forest in western Paris. His superior in 1951 and 1952 was General Eisenhower Former ally commander of the Second World War and president of the United States. He reached the rank of Admiral in 1952. He retired in May 1956. He died in La Glacerie in 1963. An avenue of the city and another in Marly-le-Roi now bear his name.

Formed as an NKVD unit in mid-1941, the division saw its first combat on the Northwestern Front at Staraya Russa and in the Valdai Hills. It was transferred to the Kalinin Front for the Soviet counteroffensive in the Battle of Moscow in late 1941. The 262nd remained in the Kalinin area until 1943, when it was moved to the Demidov area to fight in the Battle of Smolensk later that year. After the Battle of Smolensk, the division advanced west into eastern Belarus, and fought near Vitebsk in late 1943. In June 1944 it broke through the German lines around that city during Operation Bagration, and advanced into Lithuania during the summer. The division moved into East Prussia in early 1945, fighting in the East Prussian Offensive and the Battle of K√∂nigsberg. In April, it was withdrawn from the front and relocated to Mongolia in May and June to fight in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, which began in early August. After the end of the invasion, the division garrisoned Port Arthur until its disbandment in the summer of 1946.  History   World War II  The 262nd Rifle Division began forming at Vladimir in the Moscow Military District as the 16th NKVD Mountain Division on 26 June 1941. It used 1,500 NKVD troops as a cadre, and was transferred to the Red Army as the 262nd Rifle Division before 10 July. It included the 940th, 945th, and the 950th Rifle Regiments, the 788th Artillery Regiment, a separate communications company (later the 684th Communications Battalion from 1944), the 315th Anti- Tank Battalion, 428th Sapper Battalion, and 337th Reconnaissance Company. NKVD officer Major General Mikhail Kleshnin took command of the division at Vladimir. Without completing its formation, on the night of 19‚Äì20 July the division was moved to the Mozhaysk area as part of the Reserve Front's 33rd Army. A week later it was transferred to the Northwestern Front's 34th Army. The 262nd was holding positions southwest of Lake Ilmen by 1 August with the 34th Army. Later that month, it suffered heavy losses in the , and Kleshnin was relieved of command in September and demoted to regimental command in another division. On 19 September, its first Red Army commander, Colonel Matvey Tereshchenko, was assigned. At the time the 262nd was defending positions in the Valdai Hills. In the second half of October, it moved east to the Kalinin Front's 31st Army, which was preparing for the Soviet winter counteroffensive in the Battle of Moscow. The division fought in the Kalinin Defensive Operation and the Kalinin Offensive during the winter campaign. During the latter on 21 December, during the battle for Pushkino, Tereshchenko was killed in action while organizing his troops for an attack. He was replaced by division chief of staff Colonel Vladimir Gorbachyov. The division spent most of the winter of 1941‚Äì1942 with the front's 39th Army. Major General Zakhary Usachyov took command on 26 June 1943, when the division was part of the 43rd Army. Until 15 September, the division fought in defensive battles near Demidov, then fought in the Dukhovshchina‚ÄìDemidov Offensive. For its actions in the capture of Demidov, the division was awarded the honorific \\"Demidov\\" on 22 September and Usachyov received a second Order of the Red Banner. The division remained with the Kalinin Front, which became the 1st Baltic Front on 20 October. In October and November, the 262nd fought in the advance on Vitebsk during the Belorussian Strategic Offensive as part of the army's 1st Rifle Corps. It then defended positions on the approaches to Vitebsk, rejoining the 39th Army on 15 December. The army became part of the 3rd Belorussian Front for Operation Bagration in June 1944, and remained with the front until April 1945. On 23 June 1944, at the start of Operation Bagration, it was part of the army's 84th Rifle Corps. For the initial attack (part of the Vitebsk‚ÄìOrsha Offensive), the division was to attack alongside the 5th Guards Rifle Corps, break through the German defenses on the line of Bondino and Mosino and capture Starinki. It was then to advance on Trubachi alongside the 5th Guards Rifle Corps, outflanking German troops around Vitebsk. In the initial attack, preceded by a 1-hour artillery barrage at 06:00, the tank-supported 262nd broke through the lines of the demoralized German 197th Infantry Division. By 13:00, the 262nd had pushed the 197th back to the Vitebsk‚ÄìOrsha rail line south of Vitebsk. The 262nd Rifle Division, advancing on the right of the 84th Corps' 164th Rifle Division, pivoted to maintain contact with the 158th Rifle Division east of Vitebsk, while the 164th continued pushing the 197th Infantry Division northwest along the railway line. Soviet troops from the 158th Rifle Division fighting on the Vitebsk railway line On 24 June, after the German LIII Army Corps, holding Vitebsk, withdrew to reduce its frontage, the 84th Rifle Corps was concentrated in a narrow sector southwest of the city and the 158th and 262nd Rifle Divisions advanced north against the German 206th Infantry Division. The 262nd advanced six kilometers to the north that day while the 158th mounted a holding attack to the east to pin the German forces in place. At 06:00 on 26 June, the 262nd joined in the attack, cutting the main road to Vitebsk as the 158th entered the city itself. On the next day, the division participated in the final assault on the city, attacking from the east alongside the 158th following a massive artillery barrage. The German defenders surrendered at 11:45, and the 39th Army moved west to take up position on the southern flank of the 5th Army. On 2 July the division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its actions at Vitebsk. It subsequently advanced into Lithuania during the Vilnius Offensive and the Kaunas Offensive during the summer. On 12 August the 262nd was awarded the Order of Suvorov 2nd class for its actions in the capture of Kaunas. The division fought in the Memel Offensive in October. From January 1945, the division moved into East Prussia, attacking towards Tilsit in the Insterburg‚ÄìKoenigsberg Offensive. The division spent the last months of the war in the Samland Group of Forces near K√∂nigsberg. The division's fighting in the Battle of K√∂nigsberg was mainly done by its artillery. On 15 February, the 262nd's 950th Rifle Regiment had only 631 men left, divided into two small battalions, but its artillery regiment was at full strength with three firing battalions. The 262nd fought in the capture of K√∂nigsberg and Fischhausen in the last months of the war. In April, the division and the rest of the 39th Army were withdrawn to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and moved to the Soviet Far East in May and June in preparation for the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. The 262nd was transported to the Choibalsan area by rail, then marched to concentration areas south of Tamsagbulag. At the beginning of the invasion on 9 August, the division was part of the 39th Army's 113th Rifle Corps in the Transbaikal Front. The 262nd fought in the Khingan‚ÄìMukden Offensive Operation of the invasion. The campaign consisted mainly of fast marches across the Mongolian deserts and the Greater Khingan mountains in temperatures nearing with little water. For distinguishing itself in the breakthrough of Japanese fortifications in the Jalainur area and crossing the Greater Khingan, the division was awarded the honorific \\"Khingan\\" on 20 September.  Postwar  The division was disbanded in August and September 1946, part of the 39th Army's 113th Rifle Corps, garrisoning Port Arthur. The 25th Guards Machine Gun Artillery Brigade was formed from the headquarters of the division's 662nd Divisional Artillery Brigade.

In December it was announced that Calling Homicide would be part of a two-film deal, along with Friendly Persuasion, booking first-run films directly into \\"second-run\\" theaters. It was the first such deal in the nation. Reception Motion Picture Daily gave the film a good review, enjoying its action and pace. They complimented the complexity of the plot, as well as the screenplay and direction of Bernds.

They are extremely rare, with only 14 being known after examining around a billion stars from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey.  Discovery  Blue large-amplitude pulsators were discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Warsaw and announced in Nature Astronomy journal in June 2017. During a 2013 search for variable stars with periods shorter than one hour, a star with a period of 28.26 minutes was detected and tentatively classified as a Œ¥ Scuti variable although it had an unusually large amplitude and short period. Examination of over one billion Milky Way stars made during the OGLE project revealed another 13 objects with similar properties: periods of 22 - 39 minutes; near-infrared amplitudes of 0.19 - 0.36 magnitudes; extremely blue, suggesting temperatures around 30,000 K; and smaller than main sequence stars of that temperature.  Characteristics  Stars of this type are characterized by changes of several dozen percent of the brightness on an average of half an hour (between 20-40 minutes). A detailed analysis of the observation results confirms that BLAP objects have a temperature of about 30,000 ¬∞C, and the cause for variability is pulsation. The construction model is similar to giant star models - 96% of the mass is concentrated in a core of only 20% of the radius of the entire star. The rest of the mass is a slightly ruffled envelope that pulsates at rapid rhythm - hence the large amplitude of the glare. Currently, the theory only explains how BLAP stars are built and how their brightness changes, while there are only hypotheses about the formation of such stars. One of the hypotheses is that these stars must have lost a large portion of their mass at some point in their evolution to be as hot as they are now. Scientists assume that such a configuration can not come through the evolution of a lonely star, and one possibility is, for example, the passage of a star in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole to the center of the galaxy. Then the black hole can deprive the star of the outer layer; but as the scientists suggest, such a scenario is very unlikely. Another more likely hypothesis assumes that these objects can be formed after the merger of two small mass stars.

What distinguished the CIO-PAC from previous political groups (including the AFL's political operations) was its \\"open, public operation, soliciting support from non-CIO unionists and from the progressive public... Moreover, CIO political operatives would actively participate in intraparty platform, policy, and candidate selection processes, pressing the broad agenda of the industrial union movement.\\" Background FBI mugshot of Eugene Dennis (1948) In his 1993 memoir, John Abt, general counsel for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America under Sidney Hillman, claimed the leaders of the Communist Party of the USA had inspired the idea of the CIO- PAC: > In 1943, Gene Dennis came to me and Lee Pressman to first raise the idea of > a political action committee to organize labor support for Roosevelt in the > approaching 1944 election. Pressman approached Murray with the idea, as I > did with Hillman. Both men seized upon the proposal with great enthusiasm. Abt and Pressman become the CIO-PAC's co-counsels. Thus, in 1943, as American spy Elizabeth Bentley resurrected the Ware Group (of which Abt had been a member), could not risk involvement with her or the group. Instead, the group reformed under Victor Perlo as the Perlo Group. Momentum for the CIO-PAC came from the Smith‚ÄìConnally ActThe Act's correct title is \\"Smith-Connally,\\" not \\"Smith-Connelly\\". See: Wagner, Kennedy, Osborne, and Reyburn, The Library of Congress World War II Companion, 2007, p. 196. or War Labor Disputes ActMalsberger, From Obstruction to Moderation: The Transformation of Senate Conservatism, 1938-1952, 2000, p. 104. (50 U.S.C. App. 1501 et seq.) was an American law passed on June 25, 1943, over President Franklin D. Roosevelt's veto.Karatnycky, Freedom in the World: The Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties, 2000-2001, 2000, p. 115. The legislation was hurriedly created after 400,000 coal miners, their wages significantly lowered because of high wartime inflation, struck for a $2-a-day wage increase.Karatnycky, Freedom in the World: The Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties, 2000-2001, 2000, p. 114; Atleson, Labor and the Wartime State: Labor Relations and Law During World War II, 1998, p. 195. The Act allowed the federal government to seize and operate industries threatened by or under strikes that would interfere with war production,Wagner, Kennedy, Osborne, and Reyburn, The Library of Congress World War II Companion, 2007, p. 196. and prohibited unions from making contributions in federal elections.La Raja, Small Change: Money, Political Parties, and Campaign Finance Reform, 2008, p. 63; Sabato and Ernst, Encyclopedia of American Political Parties and Elections, 2006, p. 279. The war powers bestowed by the Act were first used in August 1944 when the Fair Employment Practices Commission ordered the Philadelphia Transportation Company to hire African-Americans as motormen. The 10,000 members of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Employees Union (PRTEU), a labor union unaffiliated with either the American Federation of Labor or the Congress of Industrial Organizations, led a sick-out strike, now known as the Philadelphia transit strike of 1944, for six days.Goodwin, No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II, 1995, p. 537; \\"Philadelphia Transit Strike (1944),\\" in Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working-Class History, 2007, p. 1087-1088; Winkler, \\"The Philadelphia Transit Strike of 1944,\\" Journal of American History, June 1972.\\"Trouble in Philadelphia,\\" Time, August 14, 1944. President Roosevelt sent 8,000 United States Army troops to the city to seize and operate the transit system, and threatened to draft any PRTEU member who did not return to the job within 48 hours.Klinkner and Smith, The Unsteady March: The Rise and Decline of Racial Equality in America, 2002, p. 191. Roosevelt's actions broke the strike. Philip Murray, 2nd CIO presidentIn November 1946, prior to passage of the Smith-Connally Act, the CIO's second president, Philip Murray appointed John Brophy (a UMW leader, by then head of the CIO's director of Industrial Union Councils), Nathan Cowan (CIO legislative director), and J. Raymond Walsh (CIO research director) to report on CIO political operations. Their report of December 1946 included recommendation for a permanent CIO national political group and consideration for formation of an American Labor Party. During CIO Executive Board meetings in January and February 1943, the board approved most recommendations. Formation FDR with Chiang Kai-shek and Winston Churchill at the Cairo Conference (December 1943) Upon passage of the Smith-Connally Act on June 25, 1943, Murray called for a political action committee. The CIO- PAC formed in July 1943 to support the fourth candidacy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt for U.S. President in 1944 toward the end of World War II. It also provided financial assistance to other CIO-endorsed political candidates and pro-labor legislation (e.g., continuation of the Wagner Act against the Taft- Hartley Act in 1947). CIO member unions funded it. Its first head was Sidney Hillman, founder and head of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, from 1943 to 1946. Sidney Hillman, first CIO-PAC chairman and ACW president First members of the CIO-PAC included the following: * Sidney Hillman, chairman (founder and head of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America or ACW) * R. J. Thomas, treasurer (president of the United Auto Workers or UAW) * Vann Bittner, member (national organizer for the United Mine Workers or UMW) * Sherman Dalrymple, member (president of the United Rubber Workers) or URW) * Albert Fitzgerald, member (president of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America or UE) * David McDonald, member (secretary- treasurer of the United Steel Workers of America or USWA) John Abt and Lee Pressman became the CIO-PAC's co-counsels. Calvin Benham Baldwin left government at that time to go work for the CIO-PAC. (By August 1948, the Washington Post had dubbed Baldwin along with John Abt and Lee Pressman (the latter two members of the Soviet underground Ware Group involved in the Hiss- Chambers Case) as \\"influential insiders\\" and \\"stage managers\\" in the Wallace presidential campaign. ) 20th Century After 1944, Lucy Randolph Mason worked with the CIO-PAC in the South, helping to register union members, black and white, and working for the elimination of the poll tax. She also forged lasting links between labor and religious groups. On October 17, 1950, New York State Supreme Court Judge Ferdinand Pecora and US Senator Herbert H. Lehman (D-NY) gave radio addresses on behalf of the CIO-PAC during prime (10:30-11:15 P.M.). In 1955, when the CIO rejoined the American Federation of Labor to form the AFL-CIO, Jack Kroll became head of the CIO-PAC, which merged with the AFL's \\"League for Political Education\\" to form the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Education. 21st Century PAC activities by AFL-CIO and its members continue into the 21st Century. In 2015, an AFL-CIO‚Äôs moratorium on federal PAC contributions by its member unions began to fall apart weeks after its announcement. Defiant unions included: United Food and Commercial Workers, the International Association of Machinists, and the Laborers‚Äô International Union of North America‚Äì13% were non-compliant.

It was founded as a private zoo in 1997 and currently remains private. The zoo is located near the Muang District and the Phuket Bay. The zoo has been embroiled in controversy over its lack of animal welfare standards and allegations of extreme cruelty to animals. The zoo makes up 30 rai (12 acres). It is known for having close encounters with many exotic animals including tigers, monkeys and elephants. The zoo has many sections including areas devoted to crocodiles, elephants and monkeys while also having an aquarium and an orchard garden. Animal shows inside Phuket Zoo Monkey shows The monkey show consists of a macaque monkey doing tricks and then taking pictures with the crowd. Some of the monkey's tricks include riding a bike, dunking a basketball and doing exercises, like push-ups and sit-ups. After that, the monkey will walk around with an oil-paper umbrella and take pictures with guests. Elephant shows elephants trunk in the Phuket zoo In the elephant shows, a group of asian elephants perform tricks and have an opportunity to meet the guests. The elephants start off by doing tricks like kicking a soccer ball and will also do dances and races. At times, the guests will be able to feed the elephants bananas and at the end touch their trunks. The elephants have even be trained to ask for tips. Many of these shows are demeaning to the animals involved, and some say the zoo should be shut down entirely. The elephants the zoo has were formerly logging elephants. Currently, the Zoo faces allegations of animal abuse due to their treatment of their captive elephants. Crocodile shows While there are no encounters guests can have with the crocodiles, many guests find the show very entertaining. The highlight is when one of the trainers sticks his head in between the crocodiles mouth. Exhibits Aquarium The zoo has a small aquarium with a variety of fish and marine animals including fresh-water and salt-water fish, turtles, frogs, crabs and lizards. They also have a display area showing fishing equipment and techniques of Thailand's fisherman as well as seashells. Bird Park The Phuket's Zoo Bird Park has a variety of birds including toucans, peacocks, parrots, hawks, emus and ostriches. Some of the birds are allowed to fly freely in the park. For some reason there's a civet cat Animal encounters As well as the opportunities to meet the animals during the shows, the Phuket Zoo also allows guests to meet some of their other animals. Some of those opportunities include getting to take pictures and pet a tiger. Formerly, you could take pictures and touch an orangutan, but she was later confiscated by the police. The experiences cost an extra fee. Conservation efforts by the zoo It does not appear that the Phuket Zoo is involved with conservation efforts to save animals worldwide. They are also not accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums or the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Milo the Orangutan The Phuket Zoo formerly had an orangutan named, Milo. However, a petition garnished over 10,000 signatures for her to be removed due to her being forced to take photos and her health struggles. Due to the petition, the Natural Resources and Environmental Crime Division of the Royal Thai Police and Department of National Parks decided to confiscate her after it appeared she was being kept illegally. When the authorities came to confiscate Milo, she was not at the zoo. All pictures of her on the zoo's website were also deleted. Later in the week, Milo was found in a small cage in the jungle. Milo later died the following year of a stroke. Her bad health from her time at the zoo most likely contributed to her passing. Controversy While many guests enjoy their time at the Phuket Zoo, many people find the zoo to be cruel and inhumane. Disappearance of animals Some guests have complained that animals at the zoo including snow leopards and camels disappeared without any word from the zoo. Some people have speculated that the animals may have gotten sick and were sold off before they died. Monkeys The macaque monkey used in the monkey shows have a rope around their neck and are forced to do tricks. One exhibit holds two monkeys, but one is more aggressive than the other forcing it to become malnourished. One gibbon is even in a staff-member's arms all day and stays in a cage with a lock at night with no room to move. Elephants In 2019, a 2-year-old elephant died from injuries he sustained after performing for tourists.https://people.com/pets/baby-elephant-dies-phuket-zoo-thailand/ Crocodiles The crocodile exhibit is highly criticized for being overcrowded, small and dirty. Many people have said the water the crocodiles have is too shallow and is filled with feces. They have also been caught on video being poked at with brooms. Turtle A video of a turtle at the Phuket Zoo's Aquarium sparked controversy as its exhibit seemed to be too small for it to move. Bird Park Some of the birds in the Bird Park are chained up and some guests have said the bird's cages are too small and overcrowded. Drugging of animals Due to the fact many animals have encounters with humans, many guests speculate that the animals are drugged so they don't attack humans. Inadequate exhibits Many of the animal's exhibits, including the ostrich and deer, have no grass, shrubbery or enrichment toys. Even one of the Asiatic black bear's enclosure was just a concrete pit. Efforts to change or close the Phuket Zoo PETA has called on the zoo to \\"Improve the Living Conditions of the Animals...\\" There are also plenty of petitions online including one on change.org that call for the closing of the Phuket Zoo.

Career  Hopkins is the daughter of Ron Hopkins, who served as a baseball scout for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Texas Rangers, and Oakland Athletics during her childhood. Hopkins attended games with her father while growing up, which led her to want to be a scout. She started reading radar gun numbers off to her father when she was 8 years old. Hopkins attended Central Washington University, where she majored in psychology and played softball. In the offseason, she worked out with the men's baseball team to build her knowledge about baseball. Hopkins interned at the Mariners' baseball operations department, focusing on amateur scouting, when she was in college. After performing well during a two-week Major League Baseball scouting development program in 2015, Hopkins was hired by Mariners Scouting Director Tom McNamera to be an area scout of high school and college players for the Four Corners region of the United States. As the first female scout in more than 50 years, she says she occasionally faces surprise from players she is scouting when they discover she's female. Women traditionally have a harder time breaking into roles like baseball scouting because they play softball, not baseball, in school; almost all scouts are former players. Hopkins' work with her father and her lifelong drive to know about the game of baseball gave her the skills necessary to do her job.

He is a professor of mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. Education Van den Dries began his undergraduate studies in 1969 at Utrecht University, and in 1978 completed his PhD there under the supervision of Dirk van Dalen with a dissertation entitled Model Theory of Fields. Career and research Van den Dries was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in the 1982‚Äì1983 academic year. He has been on the faculty of the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign since 1986 and a professor in its Center for Advanced Study since 1998. Van den Dries is most known for his seminal work in o-minimality, but he has also made contributions to the model theory of -adic fields, valued fields, and finite fields, and to the study of transseries. With Alex Wilkie, he improved Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth using nonstandard methods. Van den Dries was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1990 and 2018, and delivered the Tarski Lectures at the University of California, Berkeley in 2017. Awards and honours Van den Dries has been a corresponding member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1993. He was awarded the Shoenfield Prize from the Association for Symbolic Logic in 2016 for his chapter \\"Lectures on the Model Theory of Valued Fields\\" in Model Theory in Algebra, Analysis and Arithmetic, edited by Dugald Macpherson and Carlo Toffalori.

He was one of the most ardent enemies of King Charles I during the last stage of the era of \\"feudal anarchy\\". Family affairs and possessions His name derived from the Latin variant (Moyses) of the biblical name Moses. He was born into the so-called Ernye branch of the gens √Åkos as the eldest son of Mojs I, who served as Count of the Sz√©kelys, then Master of the treasury in the Queen's court. He had two siblings, a brother Ell≈ës (Achilles), who supported his efforts during King Charles' unification war, and a sister, who married a certain Andrew S√°rpataki.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus √Åkos 3., Erne branch) Historian Attila Zsoldos argued S√°rpataki is identical with that Andrew, son of Ipoch from the gens Bog√°tradv√°ny, whose landholdings in Doboka, Kolozs and Torda counties were confiscated and donated to Thomas Sz√©cs√©nyi by Charles I for his \\"treachery\\", as he was a strong supporter of the late Voivode Ladislaus K√°n and his family. Zsoldos considered the S√°rpatak lordship (today in Albe»ôti commune in Romania) contributed to the increase of Mojs and Ell≈ës' influence. From their father Mojs I, the brothers jointly inherited Buza, Noszoly and Lak in Doboka County (today Buza, NƒÉsal and Lacu in Romania), and Budatelke in Kolozs County (today Bude»ôti, Romania). In August 1318, Charles nominally confiscated these lands. Their seized land of Mojsp√°lyi was handed over to the King's another loyal soldier D√≥zsa Debreceni as a royal donation in 1322. Before his betrayal, Mojs II also owned Petresfalva (today Petro»ôni»õa in Buco»ôni»õa commune, Romania). Mojs first appeared in contemporary sources, when he acted as an arbitrator during a lawsuit in Gyulafeh√©rv√°r (today Alba Iulia, Romania) on 7 March 1313. Sometimes before 1313, Mojs married an unidentified daughter of the powerful baron James Borsa. Thus he became a relative to the Borsa clan, which ruled the area of Tisz√°nt√∫l de facto independently of the royal power at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries. James Borsa supported Charles in his war of succession for the Hungarian throne, and served his Palatine from 1306 to 1314. Thanks to the political influence of his father-in-law, Mojs functioned as Master of the cupbearers between around 1313 and 1314. In the same time, a document also styled him as isp√°n of Bistritz royal estate (today Bistri»õa, Romania). His rebellion In 1314, James Borsa and his kindred turned against Charles. In December, their troops clashed with the royal army at the first time. Soon, the Borsas, who suffered a heavy defeat in the northeastern areas of their province in Tisz√°nt√∫l, made a ceasefire with the king (for instance, in July 1315, Beke Borsa was made Master of the treasury). Mojs did not participate in the Borsas' first rebellion against Charles. In early 1315, the powerful Ladislaus K√°n died, but his sons did not yield to Charles. The king appointed his loyal baron Nicholas Pok as Voivode of Transylvania, and commissioned him to crush their rebellion in the summer of 1315. Sometime in 1315 or 1316, Pok's army was defeated and expelled from Transylvania by Mojs, according to a royal charter issued in August 1318. After his victory, Mojs gained a lot of loot and sent the captured royal banners to his father-in-law James Borsa. Because of uncertain chronology, there are several contradictory interpretations among the historians to outline the course of events. Historian P√°l Engel, who first attempted to reconstruct the order of events in his 1988 study, argued the peace between Charles and the Borsas has collapsed by the first half of 1316. In the same time, Beke was replaced as Master of the treasury by the king's long-time supporter Demetrius Nekcsei. Accordingly, James Borsa made an alliance against Charles with Ladislaus K√°n's sons and other lords, including Mojs, the Gutkeleds of Szil√°gys√°g (SƒÉlaj) and Peter, son of Petenye. They also offered the crown to Andrew of Galicia. Engel, who connected their conspiracy with Stefan Milutin's campaign against Hungary, argued, they broke the rebellion around the end of 1316. As a part of this, Mojs was victorious over Nicholas Pok and expelled him from Transylvania. In contrast, historian Gyula Krist√≥ argued in his 2003 publication that the skirmish between Mojs √Åkos and Nicholas Pok took place at the end of 1315. He highlighted that Pok last appeared as Voivode in contemporary documents in April 1316. Accordingly, Nicholas Pok, who prepared a war against the K√°ns, arrived on a bypass road across the Meszes Gate (today in Mese»ô Mountains) from Lippa (today Lipova, Romania) to Transylvania because of Mojs' sudden rebellion, which interrupted and delayed the showdown against the K√°ns, as Krist√≥ considered. Historian Attila B√°r√°ny supported Krist√≥'s theory and noted the appointment of Beke Borsa as Master of the treasury in mid-1315 could mean that he remained loyal to Charles even after 1314, while his brother James and nephew Bekcs rebelled against the royal authority, thus it did not prove the alleged peace between the Borsas and Charles throughout 1315. However historian Attila Zsoldos, who also examined the contents of Nicholas Pok's charters, in addition to the dates and locations, challenged Krist√≥'s interpretation in 2016. He argued, if, as Krist√≥ considered, Nicholas Pok arrived to prepare a war to Transylvania immediately after his appointment, he would not have dealt with insignificant estate affairs in his diplomas as he did. Zsoldos considered, the 1318 charter, which narrated the Voivode's appointment and the following events, twisted the years and Mojs was declared the king's enemy retroactively. He argued the Meszes Gate was chosen as a safer route than the K√°ns' freshly occupied territory. Thus Zsoldos supported Engel's chronology and dated Mojs' rebellion to Autumn or Winter 1316. Charles immediately responded to unfavorable developments and launched a multi-faceted war against James Borsa and his allies in early 1317. His military leaders captured several castles of Peter, son of Petenye in Zempl√©n County in the following months, who sought refuge in the court of Mojs √Åkos after that. After Pok's failure, Charles appointed John Fon√≥i as \\"captain of the Transylvanian parts\\" and sent him to the province to crush Mojs' insurgency. However, Mojs left Transylvania for a short time and joined the Borsas' army in Tisz√°nt√∫l. Charles's troops, which were under the command of a former familiaris of the Borsas, D√≥zsa Debreceni, defeated the rebels' united troops at Debrecen in the first half of 1317 (Zsoldos provided the exact date to 10 February, while another opinions considered the battle took place in 1316). After the defeat, James Borsa barricaded himself into the castle of Adorj√°n Castle (today ruins near SƒÉlard, Romania), while Mojs returned to Transylvania. In the following months, Charles decisively defeated the Borsas' dominion, leaving Mojs without allies. Many fortresses of the insurgents fell to the royal troops in Bihar, Szolnok, Borsod and Kolozs counties. James Borsa left Adorj√°n for S√≥lyomk≈ë (now in Ale»ôd, Romania), where Charles built two nearby counter-castles in order to famish James Borsa without siege. A royal charter from 1324 mentioned the returning Mojs' troops clashed with Fon√≥i's army near Csics√≥ Castle () in Szolnok County for the first time, then at an unidentified village, Gyalu or Gyeke in Kolozs County (today GilƒÉu and Geaca, respectively). Mojs was victorius both times, as a result Fon√≥i withdrew from the province. After that, Mojs gathered his army and successfully besieged Valk√≥ Castle, capturing and torturing its castellan Ken√©z Geszti. Due to the successful siege, Mojs acquired most of the landholdings in Kraszna County. Thereafter, he left Transylvania to provide assistance to James Borsa. The arriving Mojs tried to break the blockade at S√≥lyomk≈ë (in late 1317 or early 1318). Though he managed to torch one of the counter-castles and imprisoned its castellan Stephen Gutkeled, but failed to free his father-in-law. James Borsa was captured by the royal troops after his surrender (possibly in May 1318), but escaped execution and was eventually ransomed by Mojs. The Borsas lost all political influence after 1317, and Mojs √Åkos remained the most ardent and militarily the most successful enemy of Charles. Thus one of the staunchest supporters of the King, D√≥zsa Debreceni, who successfully waged war against the oligarchs in the previous years, was appointed Voivode of Transylvania in the summer of 1318. In July 1318, D√≥zsa Debreceni launched his Northern Transylvanian campaign against Mojs. At Zilah (today ZalƒÉu, Romania), he summoned the Transylvanian noblemen to join his army and ordered the postponements of all incumbent lawsuits in the province. Mojs and his militia tried to prevent Debreceni to advance into the inner parts at Topa, midway between the Meszes Gate and Kolozsv√°r (today Cluj-Napoca, Romania), but suffered a heavy defeat. His allies, who lost their powers by then, James Borsa and Peter, son of Petenye were also involved Mojs' army, in addition to Saxon auxiliary troops. After his defeat, Charles nominally confiscated Mojs' lands in Kolozs and Doboka counties, declaring him \\"disloyal\\". The King considered the skirmish at Topa as \\"even greater victory\\" than the Borsas' defeat in his August 1318 charter. Finally, in early 1320, Mojs and his brother Ell≈ës were killed in a battle at Bonchida (today Bon»õida, Romania) by a royal army led by Stephen Losonci, a former Count of the Sz√©kelys. Charles I wrote in his donation letter in March 1320 that the \\"infidel\\" and \\"notorious\\" √Åkos brothers were \\"miserably perished\\". Although the contemporary documents clearly referred to Losonci as the commander of the victorious royal army, Charles personally thanked Debreceni for the victory, when he and his escort visited Debrecen in May 1320. Charles still even praised Mojs' fall and death in 1329. However peace has not arrived to Transylvania yet, as the K√°n sons were a serious threat to the royal power through the continuous looting and raids until the end of the 1320s. While P√°l Engel distinguished three campaigns against Mojs, took place in 1317, 1318 and 1320, Gyula Krist√≥ considered the above mentioned battles as parts of a single royal campaign in 1318 led by D√≥zsa Debreceni. He argued, both John Fon√≥i and Stephen Losonci served as lieutenants of Debreceni during that war, while commanded their armies. Attila Zsoldos rejected Krist√≥'s theory as Ell≈ës was mentioned as a living person in March 1319, when Thomas Losonci (brother of Stephen) forbade him to hand over his estate of Bonyha (today Bahnea, Romania) to his relative Nicholas √Åkos, castellan of Kecsk√©s. Instead, Zsoldos argued that Mojs had no castles which must be protected, and he could move his army more flexibly and faster across the province, even after his heavy defeat at Topa, and Bonchida only proved to be decisive, because Mojs was killed in the battlefield. Historian Attila B√°r√°ny represented another extreme point of view, as he considered that D√≥zsa Debreceni resided in Transylvania to make a decisive victory over Mojs throughout in 1319, as he had no judgments and stayed away from his seat Debrecen from December 1318 to March 1320, when a permanent campaign happened against the rebellious Mojs. However Attila Zsoldos emphasized the Transylvanian Chapter functioned continuously throughout the year, in addition to courts and places of authentication, which proves there was peace in the province in 1319. He argued, Mojs lost his influence and sense of initiative after Battle of Topa, and after months of chase, Losonci's small unit put an end to his insurgency at Bonchida. In historiography Until the last decade of the 19th-century historiography, researchers like Vince Bunyitay and Andr√°s Kom√°romy incorrectly claimed that Mojs √Åkos (as he had namesake father) was the son of the powerful baron Mojs II, Palatine of Hungary, despite the fact that he had died without male heirs according to his last will and testament in 1280. M√≥r Wertner was the first historian, who identified Mojs' father (Mojs I) and grandfather (Albert, Ban of Severin) in 1909, but without the determination of his kindred, which was first stated by L√°szl√≥ Makkai in 1944, but this was rejected by the notable and prestigious genealogist J√°nos Kar√°csonyi, which delayed the recognition of the correctness of Makkai's finding. According to Gyula Krist√≥, Mojs √Åkos became a serious aspirant to become a so-called \\"provincial lord\\", who \\"cleverly exploited that political vacuum, which was emerged in Transylvania and the surrounding areas after the death of Ladislaus K√°n\\". While Charles tried to annihilate K√°n dominion between the Tisza river and Transylvania, Mojs established his \\"petty kingdom\\" at Northern Transylvania. P√°l Engel claimed G√∂rg√©ny Castle (today Gurghiu in Romania) possibly functioned as the provincial seat of Mojs' territory, as Attila B√°r√°ny also shared this view. In royal documents after the Borsas' fall, Mojs appeared as the most dangerous enemy of Charles in Transylvania, who was mentioned in the first place in such formula like \\"Mojs and his accomplices\\", overshadowing his father-in-law and kinship, in addition to the K√°ns and other members of the √Åkos clan. B√°r√°ny called Mojs as the \\"strongman\\" of the insurgents, despite James Borsa was released from captivity. In contrary to other opinions, Attila Zsoldos, who analyzed Mojs' character in his 2017 study, highlighted that he exclusively faced the royal armies in open battles during that period when castle sieges were much more prevalent, because, rejecting Engel's hypothesis in connection to G√∂rg√©ny, which first appeared in contemporary sources only since 1358, Mojs did not own any castles, which was \\"the primary condition for becoming an oligarch\\". Thus Mojs was unable to strictly control a region (domain), but it provided him an unusual flexibility in his clashes. Zsoldos also argued Mojs always faced Charles together with his father-in-law James Borsa. He did not support the K√°ns' aspiration, captured Valk√≥ and handed over it to his relative Beke Borsa, tried to free James Borsa, thus he cannot be considered an oligarch. His presence in Transylvania meant that the Borsa clan succeeded to keep a part of their influence in the region even after the late Roland Borsa had to resign as Voivode of Transylvania in favour of Ladislaus K√°n decades earlier.

She was awarded a presidential medal for her efforts in development. She founded Mujeres Unidas de Michigan as an advocacy group for Spanish-speaking women and as a result of their activism the group sent six delegates to the 1977 National Women's Conference, which was a part of the UN International Women's Year programs. Vorhauer served as vice chair of the delegation to the conference. She authored the Mason Miller Report, an evaluation of minorities and higher education, which became the model for analyzing participation of minorities in colleges and universities throughout Michigan, leading to a state bi-lingual education law. When she lost her sight, due to diabetes, Vorhauer became an advocate for the blind. She was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 1990, the first Latina to be honored in the hall. Early life Delia Villegas was born on April 17, 1940 in El Paso, Texas to Consuelo (n√©e Olivares) and Bernardo Villegas. Her father was an optometrist, as had been his father, and the couple raised their two older sons and Delia, as well as their adopted daughter Rebecca in the traditions of their Mexican heritage. Villegas attended Catholic school across the border in Juarez, Mexico. At the age of thirteen, based on the family history and her perusal of her father‚Äôs medical books, Villegas diagnosed herself with diabetes, which the family physician confirmed. She attended El Paso High School, becoming the editor of the school newspaper, The Tatler. Upon her graduation, Villegas moved to Chicago, where the family had relatives and enrolled Rosary College, in nearby River Forest, Illinois in 1958. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in sociology in 1962. Career Upon graduation, Villegas began her career as a social worker in the children's services department for Chicago working with adoptions and protective services. She also published a weekly column, Servicio Social in the local Spanish newspaper. In 1964, when the Manpower Development and Training Act (MDTA) was expanded to include training and development programs for the non-English speaking population, Villegas was hired as a director of the program by the Archdiocesan Latin American Committee (ALAC) to help them implement services in the Chicago area. Besides giving vocational training and English lessons, the ALAC provided family and financial counseling services, as well as medical referral information. Special programs were also provided to target Chicago's Puerto Rican populations, providing them with adult language courses. In 1967, Villegas was one of five women out of fifty-two speakers called to testify before President Lyndon B. Johnson's Cabinet Committee Hearing on all aspects of life, except the draft and women's issues, impacting the Hispanic community in the United States. That same year, she was recognized with a presidential medal for directing the most successful MDTA program in the United States. On June 22, 1968, Villegas married William Federico Vorhauer and the couple relocated to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where her husband was completing his graduate studies. Vorhauer to help put him through school, as the director of the Hispanic Affairs Division of the Boston Community Development office. She developed a store-front school for inner- city youth in Boston and coordinated the first \\"city-wide conference on Puerto Rican affairs\\". The following year, the couple moved to Bowling Green, Ohio, where Vorhauer worked as the State Supervisor of the Migrant Reception Centers for the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services, where she focused on migrants' relocation issues. In 1972, she returned to school to work on her master's degree and began working as the Director of the Mexican-American Project at Bowling Green State University. Completing her MA in sociology in 1974, she was hired by the Michigan Department of Education as a higher education consultant and the couple relocated to Lansing, Michigan. In 1975, after attending a statewide conference for Latina women, Vorhauer founded Mujeres Unidas de Michigan (MUM) (United Women of Michigan) as an advocacy group to support women, and was elected its chair in 1978. That same year, she was appointed by Governor William Milliken to serve on the Michigan Women's Commission, becoming both a member of the planning committee for the United Nations' International Women's Year program and vice-chair of the Michigan delegation to the national conference. As a result of their outreach to promote Latina women to leadership roles, MUM sent six members in the delegation of forty-eight Michigan women to attend the 1977 National Women's Conference in Houston, Texas. In 1976, Vorhauer authored the Mason Miller Report, an evaluation of minorities and higher education, which became the model for analyzing participation of minorities in colleges and universities throughout Michigan. The report became the basis of a bi-lingual education law passed by the Michigan state government in 1978, and garnered Vorhauer coverage as one of eleven women \\"Making It Happen\\" in the March 1978 issue of Redbook. Vorhauer had by that time lost 90% of her sight from diabetic complications. In 1980, the same year she received a Diana Award in recognition of her community service dedication, she underwent surgery in hopes of restoring some of her vision. Though the surgery was unsuccessful, she returned to work as a program coordinator at the Michigan Rehabilitation Services, which assists citizens with disabilities in attaining self- sufficiency. Vorhauer traveled the state, establishing referral offices until 1988, when kidney failure forced her into retirement and dialysis. Within the year, she returned to work, accepting the vacated position of the chair of the Michigan Commission for the Blind, the first Hispanic to hold the post. Establishing a large-print newspaper, she also founded a support group for blind Catholics to attend Mass together, while heading the commission and over one hundred employees. In 1990, Vorhauer was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame, the first Latina the organization had honored. Soon after the recognition, she retired and moved with her husband to Las Cruces, New Mexico, where her brother lived. Death and legacy Vorhauser died on June 1, 1992 in Las Cruces, New Mexico. Mujeres Unidas de Michigan spawned another organization of Latina women, the Hispanic Women's in the Network, which worked to meet the needs of younger Latina women.

Early life Ferr√°ndiz was born in Valencia, Spain in 1963. He was the first of three siblings. First rape and incarceration Ferr√°ndiz's first crime took place on August 6, 1989, when he deliberately ran over an 18-year-old female motorcyclist named Mar√≠a. The crash was non-fatal, but the victim broke her ankle. Ferr√°ndiz exited his car and approached Mar√≠a, feigning apology and inviting her into his vehicle in order, he claimed, to drive her to the hospital. Once inside, he drove her to an isolated area and raped her, before subsequently abandoning her near the hospital. Ferr√°ndiz was identified by another motorist who had witnessed the collision Ferr√°ndiz was arrested and sentenced to fourteen years in prison for this crime. For the duration of his incarceration, he shared his cell with another criminal who had killed his wife. After his release, Ferr√°ndiz would imitate the modus operandi of this cellmate in his own murders. In 1995, he was paroled following a campaign by his friends and family that claimed his innocence and decried his internment as unjust. His good behavior during his time in prison, when he collaborated in the prison newsletter La Saeta, was cited as a reason for his early release. Upon his excarceration, Ferr√°ndiz moved to Castell√≥n de la Plana with his mother and worked in a car insurance company. His co-workers described him as \\"absolutely normal,\\" polite and charming. Ferr√°ndiz committed all of his later crimes during weekends, in party areas in and around the city of Castell√≥n. Murders Sonia Rubio Arrufat, a 25-year-old English teacher, was last seen at 5:00 a.m. on the morning of July 2, 1995, leaving a Benic√†ssim disco that she had attended with friends. She intended to walk the one kilometer distance between the disco and her parents apartment in Benic√†ssim, but she never reached her destination. Her body was found by a motorist on November 20, hidden in thick bushes near the road between Benic√†ssim and Oropesa del Mar. She was half-dressed, with her hands tied and her mouth covered with duct tape. The Spanish Civil Guard codenamed the investigation of Rubio's murder Operaci√≥n Bola de Cristal (\\"Operation Crystal Ball\\"). The following year, in September 1996, 22-year-old Amelia Sandra Garc√≠a Costa disappeared. She, too, was last seen leaving a disco in Castell√≥n. Her half- dressed body, also with her hands tied, was found in a pond of Onda in March 1997. Her murder was immediately linked to Rubio's due to the similarities between the victims and the perpetrator's modus operandi. In February 1998, Ferr√°ndiz attempted to repeat his 1989 attack on another female motorist, but the victim fought back and escaped after biting his finger. She was able to give police a full description of her attacker, as well as part of his car plate. With this information, the Civil Guard launched an operation to monitor Ferr√°ndiz. They noticed that he regularly visited an area of Castell√≥n called \\"Los Cipreses,\\" where there was a high concentration of discos and night- clubs, and that whilst there, he acted strangely, as if he was stalking different women in order to identify a potential victim. It is believed that Ferr√°ndiz did not know any of his victims personally, but that he watched them for a long period before striking. Ferr√°ndiz attempted another attack in July 1998, when he deflated the tyre of a woman's car before she left a nearby nightclub. The woman suffered a non-fatal car crash, but Ferr√°ndiz could not abduct her as he had intended. This incident was witnessed by plain-clothes Guardia Civil officers, who arrested Ferr√°ndiz in his office a few days later, on July 29. A parallel search of his home found the roll of duct tape that he had used to gag Sonia Rubio, tying him to the first crime. Ferr√°ndiz initially admitted to the rape of two women, but he denied involvement in any murders. He was charged with Rubio's abduction, sexual assault and murder. By October 21, however, he had admitted to killing Rubio, Garc√≠a and three prostitutes whose skeletonized bodies had been found in a riverbank near Vila-real in early 1996: Natalia Archelos Olaria (24), Mercedes V√©lez Ayala (18), and Francisca Salas Le√≥n (24). These three murders had been investigated as related to each other, but had not been linked to the murders of Rubio or Garc√≠a, and a truck driver had been arrested as a suspect. Several psychiatric evaluations of Ferr√°ndiz diagnosed him as a psychopath. Trial and sentence Prosecutors requested 163 years in prison with the recommendation that Ferr√°ndiz be never paroled again, and a fine of 200 million pesetas to compensate the families of all five victims. In addition, they also petitioned that the State be named secondarily responsible for not keeping Ferr√°ndiz under the necessary surveillance after he was excarcerated. On January 14, 2000 Ferr√°ndiz was found guilty of five counts of murder, one of attempted murder, and another of imprudence resulting in injuries. Ferr√°ndiz was sentenced to 69 years in prison and to compensate the families with 130 million. The State was acquitted. In media Ferr√°ndiz's crimes were loosely adapted into a third-season episode of TVE's crime anthology series La Huella del Crimen, titled El asesino dentro del c√≠rculo (\\"The murderer within the circle\\").

The next year Longsdorff enrolled at Dickinson College in Carlisle to study medicine, and was the first woman to graduate from that institution in 1887. She won the Pierson Prize in Oratory in 1886. Her father before her graduated from the same college in 1856 and her brother in 1879. After her, her sisters Hildegarde, Jessica and Persis attended Dickinson College as well, graduating in 1888, 1891 and 1894 respectively. In 1937, Dickinson College granted Longsdorff an honorary degree in science. She specialized at the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, earning an M.D. in 1890. Career Zatae Leola Longsdorff Straw was a prominent physician and was named head of the Manchester Medical Association. After her graduation, Straw worked for one year as an intern at the New England Hospital for Women and Children, and then moved to Blackfoot, Idaho, and became the resident physician at Fort Hall Indian Reservation. After her marriage Straw opened a medical practice in Manchester, New Hampshire, one of the first female physicians not only in the city but also in the state. When she entered politics, she was one of the first female legislators in New Hampshire. In November 1923 Straw was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives by Manchester's 4th ward as a Republican. She won reelection in November 1925. During her double term she held a seat on, and was also chairman of the Committee on Health, and was on the committee on Fisheries and Game (she was an avid hunter and fisher as well). In 1926 she was the first woman to serve as the chairman of the New Hampshire Republican State Convention. Close to the end of her second term, Straw tried for a New Hampshire Senate seat. She did not win but was the first woman to try for such a position. Straw was vice president, and in 1935 state president, of the New Hampshire Department of the American Legion Auxiliary. In 1941 she received a gold medal from the New Hampshire Medical Society in honour of her long service to medicine in the state. She served as president of the American Medical Society, the first woman to hold this position. Personal life In 1891 Zatae Leola Sturgis Longsdorff had moved back east after living in Idaho for three years. On November 12, 1891, she married Amos Gale Straw (1864‚Äì1926), a prominent physician of Manchester, New Hampshire. They had four children: Enid Constance (1900‚Äì1981), Zatae Gale (1906‚Äì1930), Wayne C. (1909‚Äì1931) and David Gale (1923‚Äì1979). They also adopted another child, Gertrude Grey (1898‚Äì1986). She died on October 1, 1955, and is buried at the Pine Grove Cemetery, Manchester. Soon after her death the Manchester Union Leader touted her as \\"one of New Hampshire's most distinguished women\\".

It is a loop road, running due south from the town of Marystown and continues until the town of Grand Bank where it transitions into Route 210 - and vice versa. The speed limit along much of Route 220 is 80 km/h, except in communities where the speed limit is reduced to 50 km/h (however, through the town of Fortune, the speed limit is reduced to 30 km/h). Route description Beginning at its western end, Route 220 begins as a continuation of Route 210 (Burin Peninsula Highway/Heritage Run) at an intersection with Marine Drive at the eastern end of Grand Bank. Route 220 bypasses the town to the south along Grandview Boulevard before leaving and heading west along the coastline for a few kilometres. The highway now passes through Fortune, where one can access the ferry to St. Pierre and Miquelon, before turning south to pass by Fortune Head and the towns of Lories and Point May. Route 220 heads eastward to pass through Calmer (minor settlement with only two dwellings) and Lamaline, where a local road provides access to the village of Allan's Island. It now meets a local road to Point au Gaul before passing through Taylor's Bay, Lord's Cove, Lawn, St. Lawrence, and Little St. Lawrence. Between Lord's Cove and Lawn, Route 220 meets local roads leading to Roundabout and Webbers Cove.

It can be used throughout SEPTA's transit system (bus, trolley, subway, high speed line), and on Regional Rail.  History  Before the Key System, SEPTA's fare collection was almost entirely manual. Monthly and Weekly passes were sold by a cashier at a SEPTA sales office. Tokens for bus, trolley and subway fare could be purchased from a vending machine at some stations, however exact change was required. Paper tickets and passes were used on Regional Rail. In 2012, SEPTA announced the Key project. In 2014, SEPTA began deploying the new hardware necessary for the system at each station. The initial rollout of the key card on transit services began with an early adoption program starting on June 13, 2016. Sale of Key Cards was opened to the public on February 9, 2017. As of June 1, 2017, weekly and monthly TransPasses (for urban transit, distinct from the TrailPasses for SEPTA Regional Rail) were no longer available in the old format, and users of those passes had to have a Key Card. However, the sale of weekly TransPass at third- party locations continued until July 30th, 2018. The sale of monthly TransPasses at third-party locations also ended in July 2018. Sales of paper weekly/monthly TransPasses will end at all Regional Rail stations by April 30, 2018, while token sales will end at most Regional Rail stations by April 30, 2018. Token sales will end at all transit sales offices on April 30, 2018. However, token sales at third-party locations continued until July 15, 2018. Furthermore, tokens will continue to be sold in bulk to social service agencies, as work continues to implement a new method for these organizations to provide SEPTA fares to their clients. In April 2018, SEPTA launched the external retail network for Key Cards, allowing cards to be purchased and reloaded at businesses across the Philadelphia area. On August 1, 2018, SEPTA stopped issuing or honoring paper transfers; the only way to use the reduced transfer fee is through the SEPTA Key card. On August 1, 2018, SEPTA began an early adoption program for SEPTA Key on Regional Rail from select Zone 4 stations for Monthly Zone 4 TrailPass holders. On October 1, 2018, SEPTA expanded the program to include select Zone 3 stations for Monthly and Weekly TrailPass holders. The SEPTA Key program extended to Zone 1 and Zone 2 TrailPass holders on May 1, 2019. Weekly TrailPasses will only be available on SEPTA Key starting the week of August 12, 2019 for Zones 3 and 4 and the week of September 9, 2019 for Zones 1 and 2; this will mark the end of the sale of paper Weekly TrailPasses. Monthly TrailPasses will only be available on SEPTA Key starting in October 2019 for Zones 3 and 4 and in November 2019 for Zones 1 and 2; this will mark the end of the sale of paper Monthly TrailPasses. On July 13, 2020, the Travel Wallet feature launched on Regional Rail, replacing tickets and cash, along with the Cross County Pass on a SEPTA Key card. The sale of Monthly Cross County Passes ended at third-party locations August, 2020. Sales of paper single-ride and ten-trip tickets will end on October 2, 2020.  Technology and use  SEPTA Key Fare Kiosk at the King of Prussia Transit Center Similar to a debit card issued by a bank, each Key card has a personalized 16 digit account number. A Mastercard Paypass chip is embedded in the card allowing it to be read wirelessly. Riders simply wave their card near a red fare validator pad. On buses, trolley routes, and the Norristown High Speed Line; the validator is mounted to the vehicle farebox. On the Broad Street Line and the Market-Frankford Line, the validators are located on the turnstiles that access the boarding area. At certain stations serving both subway and trolley lines (like 30th Street Station), fare is collected at the turnstiles even for trolley routes. The Norristown High Speed Line collects fares at turnstiles at 69th Street Transportation Center and Norristown Transportation Center on weekdays while the fare is collected onboard at other times and at all other stations along the line. On Regional Rail, there are turnstiles with validators at the Center City Philadelphia stations while outlying stations have platform validators. Riders \\"tap on\\" at the turnstile or platform validator to open their trip before boarding the train and \\"tap off\\" at the turnstile or platform validator to close their trip after exiting the train. The system also has a \\"Quick Trip\\" feature allowing a single fare for the Broad Street Line or the Market-Frankford Line to be purchased from a Key vending machine. Instead of a plastic card with an embedded chip, the system prints a paper ticket with a magnetic stripe. A rider with a quick trip ticket will swipe it at a black card reader mounted next to the red pad to access the boarding area. Quick Trips can also be used on Regional Rail's Airport Line on trips originating from the Philadelphia International Airport; they can be purchased from machines located on the platforms. Quick Trips are also used at the Regional Rail stations in Center City Philadelphia; riders arriving in Center City Philadelphia buy a Quick Trip before exiting the station turnstiles while riders departing Center City Philadelphia buy a Quick Trip before entering the station turnstiles. A card can be loaded with a weekly, monthly or single day pass. Unlike the older paper passes, SEPTA Key imposes a limit on how many trips a rider can take on a pass (96 for a weekly pass, 240 for a monthly pass, 8 for a One Day Convenience Pass, and 10 for a One Day Independence Pass). This is designed to prevent sharing of cards. The system also has a \\"Travel Wallet\\" feature in which riders can load money on the card and have the fare for each trip deducted from the balance when the card is presented. The Travel Wallet fare is discounted from the cash fare and costs the same as a token on transit and a ticket purchased in advance on Regional Rail. The system was designed to keep most of SEPTA's existing fare collection practices in place. For example, the system can automatically detect if a rider is transferring from another route and charge the transfer fee instead of the full fare. SEPTA Key is accepted on all SEPTA rapid transit lines (Broad Street, Market-Frankford, Norristown), buses, trolleys, trackless trolleys, and Regional Rail. SEPTA Key cards are also accepted on DART First State buses in northern New Castle County, Delaware.

She leads a multi-disciplinary research team working on mechanisms of HIV latency, clinical trials advancing potential HIV cure strategies and how HIV is affected by co-infections such as Hepatitis B. Lewin has extensive experience in scientific leadership, and is a strong advocate for community engagement and partnership in research.  Research and accomplishments  Lewin began her research career just as highly active antiretroviral treatment emerged as a transformative influence on the lives of people living with HIV. Drawn to study HIV because of its enormous global challenge, along with the complex social issues, complex medicine and potentially transformative science, Lewin's research interests have developed from questions arising during the clinical care of people living with HIV. Detecting, quantifying and potentially reactivating latent HIV is a central theme of Lewin's research, which spans basic virology, cellular immunology and clinical research. Her research laboratory is run together with immunologist and clinician Associate Professor Paul Cameron, with whom she has developed a long-standing collaboration and partnership. Lewin has authored over 250 peer- reviewed publications. While completing her postdoctoral training with David Ho at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Centre, Lewin developed a highly sensitive PCR method to detect unspliced HIV RNA, an early product of viral transcription, in people receiving antiretroviral drugs. Over 20 years later, this method still informs studies of residual HIV replication, HIV latency and viral reactivation. Lewin's laboratory has developed models of HIV latency which are used to further tease out the mechanisms involved, and to assess the impact of latency reversal agents. Lewin's lab has shown that triggering the CCR7 receptor on resting CD4 T cells can induce latency, acting through the activation of the cellular cytoskeleton, particularly actin remodelling. This chemokine-induced latency model has been used in a comprehensive comparison of in vitro models for evaluating latency reversal agents. Lewin's laboratory has also described the role of myeloid dendritic cells and other antigen- presenting cells in establishing HIV latency. Lewin's team have made contributions to the knowledge of the HIV reservoir during antiretroviral treatment. This includes studies of naive CD4 T cells, where longitudinal and cross-sectional studies have shown that both CD31+ and CD31- naive CD4 T cells contribute to the ongoing HIV reservoir and that HIV DNA is preferentially found in CD4 T cells expressing the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR6. Lewin's group has also studied immune reconstitution after antiretroviral treatment begins, exposing some of the factors associated with faster reconstitution and has demonstrated7 a link between immune reconstitution and variants in the IL-7R gene. Lewin's research has elucidated some of the basic immunology of Hepatitis B infection alone and in co-infection with HIV. Ongoing research is providing a deeper understanding of the clinical consequences of co-infection with Hepatitis B and HIV, both in Australian participants and through a long-standing collaboration with Thai researchers. Lewin's clinical research efforts have focussed on potential HIV cure strategies, particularly those using the epigenetic modifiers including histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis). In vitro experiments showed that HDACis such as entinostat, metacept-1 and -3 could activate latent HIV in primary T cells. Following a sabbatical working with Christine Katlama and Brigitte Autran at the Hopital Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re and Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC), Paris, Lewin began to focus more on moving potential cure strategies into clinical trials. Lewin's lab conducted the first multi-dose proof-of-concept HDACi trial in HIV positive participants, administering vorinostat daily over a 14-day period and assessing safety and impact on HIV transcription and reservoirs. The trial and follow-on study showed that while vorinostat was safe and able to increase HIV transcription in most participants, it did not reduce the HIV reservoir. A dose-escalation study conducted in Melbourne, Australia and San Francisco, California, USA of the anti-alcohol compound Disulfiram also showed the ability to increase levels of cell-associated unspliced HIV RNA. Both vorinostat and Disulfiram are now being investigated as part of a combination approach to latency activation ('kick' or 'tickle') followed by a second intervention to remove cells harbouring reactivated virus ('kill' or 'tease'). Lewin has been invited to present at international conferences, and gave the opening plenary at the International AIDS Conference in Vienna in 2010 to an audience of over 10,000. Lewin is also an international scientific advocate, was local co-chair for the International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2014) in Melbourne, a member of WHO and UNAIDS strategic advisory groups and lead co-author of the 2016 International AIDS Society global scientific strategy to achieve an HIV cure. Lewin is a founding council member of the Academy of Health and Medical Sciences, elected member of the Governing Council of the International AIDS Society representing the Asia Pacific region, member of the council of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia and chairs the Health Translation Advisory Committee. She chairs the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Blood Borne Viruses and Sexually Transmitted Infections, the peak advisory group to the Minister of Health of Australia.

The group, formed in October 2016, uses the slogan \\"We're the Hitlers you've been waiting for\\" and makes use of Nazi symbols such as the swastika and the Nazi salute. AR's logo features the Black Sun and Totenkopf (death's head) with an Akubra hat, a laurel wreath and a swastika. Antipodean Resistance promotes and incites hatred and violence, distributing racist, homophobic and antisemitic posters and propaganda. In 2018 its website was shut down by its hosting provider.  History  Antipodean Resistance was formed on the now-defunct Iron March website, which was a far-right website describing itself as a fascist social network, and which appears to have been home to many white supremacists, neo-Nazis and other right-wing extremists. Members of the website formed groups such as Atomwaffen Division and Antipodean Resistance.  Racist vandalism  AR has attracted attention for its Nazi-inspired vandalism in major cities in Australia. It has targeted schools in Melbourne with significant ethnic minority populations, placing posters carrying the message \\"Keep Australia White\\" along with racial slurs targeting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, Chinese Australians and African Australians which were described as \\"vile and disgusting\\" by Victorian education minister James Merlino. The group also placed a series of Chinese-language posters at universities threatening Chinese students with deportation.  Homophobic propaganda  In the lead-up to the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey AR targeted churches, universities and public places with homophobic propaganda linking same-sex marriage and paedophilia.  National Party of Australia ban  In 2018, the NSW Nationals unanimously adopted a resolution banning 22 people for life after an investigation into alleged infiltration by people with links to neo-Nazi and fascist groups. The resolution also banned any party member from joining a number of specific organisations, including Antipodean Resistance. Membership The membership of AR is reported to be very small. The group is only open to young heterosexual white people, who are \\"able to take a hit\\" for their beliefs. Members assume a pseudonym in an attempt to remain anonymous. Media outlets have reported that AR have organised secret radicalisation camps in remote forests. AR has been banned from a number of social media and online hosting platforms. Terrorism concerns Several counter-terrorism experts have suggested authorities should focus more on far-right extremists such as Antipodean Resistance. Anne Aly, the Labor MP, in 2017 suggested that the group may turn to terrorism, stating \\"For a terrorist attack to succeed, it really only takes one person.\\" She called for the group to be banned, stating \\"I would like to see some of these groups proscribed ... as terrorist and violent organisations.\\" It was reported in 2017 that ASIO, the Australian national security organisation, was monitoring the group, who were \\"willing to use violence to further their own interests.\\" See also * Far-right politics in Australia * Right-wing terrorism * Soldiers of Odin * True Blue Crew, a similar Australian neo-Nazi group that are reported to attend the same events. * United Patriots Front  References  2016 establishments in Australia Alt-right Antisemitism in Australia Opposition to Islam in Australia Organizations that oppose same-sex marriage Fascism in Australia Neo-Nazism in Australia Organizations established in 2016 White nationalism in Australia White supremacist groups ","title":"Antipodean Resistance"},{"id":"55143719","text":"There are at least 69 named lakes and reservoirs in Woodruff County, Arkansas.

Next, Earle moved two miles southeast and platted Hobart in 1848. Liverpool was briefly the county seat, soon displaced by Crown Point. John Wood laid a mill claim in 1835 which he expanded in 1837 to a saw-mill and a grist mill. This site was originally called Woodvale, but is now known as Deep River, Indiana, and is now the site of the Deep River County Park, where the original grist mill has been rebuilt. The local vintage Baseball team are known as \\"the Grinders\\". Watershed The Deep River sources at the confluence of Main Beaver Dam Ditch and Smith Ditch near Interstate 65 on the east side of Crown Point and flows east and northeast to man-made Lake George in Hobart, formed by a dam initially constructed in 1840 by George Earle. This narrow, sinuous reservoir is approximately long and wide. It meanders north and northeast to join the Little Calumet River (LCR) ¬Ω mile east of Interstate 65 and just north of Interstate 80/94 in Lake Station. From this confluence, the LCR flows east in a man-made channel known as ‚ÄúBurns Ditch‚Äù, a channelized section of the LCR that connects with the East Arm Little Calumet River and then exits north to Lake Michigan via a man-made outlet known as Port of Indiana-Burns Harbor in Portage, Indiana. Deep River's main tributaries are Deep Creek, Turkey Creek, and Duck Creek. Ecology Adjacent wetlands are found on over 10% of the Deep River watershed. Save the Dunes has been awarded funding from the Chi-Cal Rivers Fund to restore 18 acres of farmland to marshland in Hobart Marsh, adjacent to Lake George and Deep River. When completed in 2018 it will be donated to the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Riparian trees of Deep River reflect typical bottomland species of elm, ash and maple. Other species associated are sycamore, box elder, river birch, and willow. Burns Waterway is designated by the DNR as a salmonid (trout and salmon) stream. These fish are known to migrate up Deep River as far as the Lake George dam. Recreation Deep River is quite muddy and moves very slowly, usually less than one mile per hour. Some of the river is choked with a series of log jams making navigation difficult. Best canoeing levels occur in the spring. Summer may make water levels too low for canoeing.

He was involved in several strikes in the coal mining areas of Aveyron. He twice ran unsuccessfully for election to the legislature as socialist. Career Antoine-Joseph Duc was born in 1856. He was a native of Arles, and as a young man was a Proven√ßal poet. He taught French to his fellow-Proven√ßal Batisto Bonnet, who said later Duc-Quercy \\"looked like a small black bull breathing fire from mouth and nostrils. In 1877 the Soucieta Felibrenco d√© Paris was founded by Baptiste Bonnet, Jean Barnab√© Amy, Joseph Banquier, Antoine Duc (Duc-Quercy), Maurice Faure, Louis Gleize and Pierre Grivolas. The society created the journal Lou Viro-Soul√©u. Literary activity Duc-Quercy became a journalist, a member of the French Workers' Party and of the French Section of the Workers' International. He contributed to Paul Lafargue's La Socialiste, the organ of the Guesdist movement. In 1887 the paper was at risk of closing, and Duc-Quercy, Lafarge and Jules Guesde went to Marseille in an attempt to expand circulation. Gabriel Deville donated funds from an inheritance, which kept the paper alive until early February 1888, when it ceased publication until September 1890. Duc-Quercy was the editor of the Cri du peuple. When interviewing Maurice Maeterlinck in 1891 he said he was opposed to literary writers who \\"voluntarily isolate themselves, on the pretext of pure art, from the ideas of their time\\". In Jean B√©raud's painting La Madeleine chez le Pharisien (1891) each character is a member of the political or literary world. The face of Christ is that of Duc-Quercy and the face of Simon the Pharisee is that of the writer Ernest Renan. His wife, who wrote under the name \\"Ang√®le Duc-Quercy\\", was also a journalist. She was sentenced to two months in prison in 1891 for having arranged the escape of the Polish nihilist Stanislas Padlewski (1857‚Äì91). She contributed to La Revue des revues in 1899. The first issue of the Marxist journal L'√àre Nouvelle (\\"The New Era\\") appeared on 1 July 1893, founded and edited by the Guesdist George Diamandy, with the declared purpose of infusing literature with a message of revolutionary socialism. Contributors included Georgi Plekhanov, Edward Aveling and Gabriel Deville. Georges Sorel joined the editorial staff. Other contributors were Abel Hovelacque, Jean Jaur√®s, Alexandre Millerand, Lafargue, Guesde and Duc-Quercy. The journal openly provoking the reading public to explore the work of √âmile Zola, attacked the \\"reactionary\\" critics and also proudly called itself \\"eclectic\\". Political activity Duc-quercy and Ernest Roche R√©int√©gr√©... au nom de la radicanaillerie. From La Cravache illustr√©e, 10 May 1886 A strike began on 26 January 1886 in Decazeville, Aveyron department. among the workers of the Soci√©t√© des Houll√®res et Fonderies de l'Aveyron. It lasted 108 days and drew national attention. The engineer Watrin was thrown out of a window and died. Duc-Quercy went to Decazeville to support the strike and to draw national attention to the social issues in his Cri de peuple. Ernest Roche of the Intransigeant also went, as did the socialist politicians Z√©phyrin Cam√©linat, Clovis Hugues and Antide Boyer. Duc-Quercy and Ernest Roche were charged by the police. As reported by The Living Age, The miners of the Compagnie mini√®re de Carmaux held a stormy meeting on 15 August 1892. The strike began the next day and would drag out for ten weeks. Collections were organized to support the miners, whose determination, solidarity and discipline was widely admired by ordinary people. Duc-Quercy and the politicians Pierre Baudin, Alexandre Millerand, Ren√© Viviani, and Alfred L√©on G√©rault-Richard often spoke in Carmaux during the strike. Jean Jaur√®s, Duc-Quercy and Eug√®ne Baudin said the strike was an attempt to guarantee the political liberties of Carmaux voters. Paul Lafargue of the French Workers' Party saw it as part of the wider \\"political and economic battle against the bourgeoisie\\". In 1893 Duc-quercy was candidate for the legislative elections for Decazeville, but was not elected. On 30 August 1902 another strike began in Decazeville, and spread to Aubin, Cransac and the metallurgical works. The miners found themselves isolated because they were not supported by miners in other basins or by politicians they asked for help such as Guesde and Duc-Quercy. The strike was suppressed on 19 October 1902. When Duc-Quercy ran again as candidate for Decazeville in the elections of 1906 he only obtained 1,835 votes. The poor showing could be attributed to dissension in the local socialist movement after the 1902 strikes. Antoine- Joseph Duc died in 1934.

It was painted by the Euphiletos Painter as a victory prize for the Panathenaic Games in Athens in 530 BC.  Description  The amphora was made by the Euphiletos Painter in 530 BC near the end of the Archaic Period of Greece. It was discovered in Attica. Made out of terracotta, the amphora has a height of 24.5 inches (62.2 cm). On one side of the vase there is a depiction of a foot race, or stadion, and on the other side of the vase is a depiction of Athena Promachos. Many Panathenaic amphorae featured Athena in this pose and the event for which the vase was a prize for on the other side. Athena, brandishing a spear in one hand and a shield in the other, stands in between two pillars that have roosters sitting atop them. Alongside the left pillar is an inscription in Greek. This Attic amphora is painted in the black figure style, typical of all Panathenaic amphorae. Stemming from Proto-Corinthian roots, black-figure style includes incised details with silhouetted figures on a glossy vase. The silhouetted figures are the men in the stadion who are nude, bearded, and muscular. Running nude was part of the stadion, known as the gymnikos agon or nude struggle. Their musculature is highlighted through the use of incision creating white lines against the black figures. Each of the seven men have their right leg extended forward in a long stride. The vase itself is mostly black with the silhouetted figures placed within the reddish brown spaces. Surrounding the rim of the vase's neck is a painted black chain, which, above and below it, has a repeating design. Its black handles stem from the neck of the vase to the top of the body.  Function  The function of these Panathenaic prize amphorae is that they are symbols of status. These vases commemorated the athleticism of these games and the cultural importance of winning such games. Some of the games that were held include stadion, pankration, music and equestrian events. Serving as a prize for winning these events, this amphora would have been filled with oil from Athena's sacred olive groves, which was a commodity held in respect by the Greeks. Amphorae served primarily as vessels for storage evolving from pithos jars, and later, during the Late Geometric Period, they were used as marker vases for graves: their depictions and size giving indications of the social status of the deceased. Then during the Orientalizing Period, small vessels called aryballos were used to hold more valuable oils like perfumes. This evolution from storage to social status led to the creation of Panathenaic prize amphorae: symbols of status through their decorations and storage of sacred oil. The Euphiletos painter painted during the sixth century BC and created many Panathenaic prize amphorae. This amphora was one of the many he painted of various events in Panathenaic games.

He was also known as Myo-On-In Daishokoku (Grand chancellor of Myo- On-In).  Life  Moronaga was born into the northern branch of Fujiwara clan. He was the second son of Fujiwara no Yorinaga. He also retained a special relationship of \\"Quasi-son\\" with his grandfather Fujiwara no Tadajitsu. Thanks to this relationship with the ≈çdono TadajistsuÔºå Moronaga's political security was guaranteed and he was seen as one of the potential successor of the position of supreme chancellor Kanpaku. In 1151, Moronaga was entered into the noble rank of Kugyo at the age of 14. In 1154, he was appointed the acting-middle counsellor. In 1156, Moronaga's father Yorinaga planned a rebellion against Emperor Go-Shirakawa and Fujiwara no Tadamichi. Historically, the rebellion was known as the H≈çgen rebellion. The result of Yorinaga's rebellion was disastrous, he died during the rebellion while Moronaga was seen as a potential threat to the Japanese monarch. Consequently, Moronaga was ostracized to Tosa province. In 1164, Moronaga was allowed to return to Kyoto. Soon after his return, his noble rank was also recovered. In 1177, Moronaga was promoted to the position of Daij≈ç-daijin (chancellor). Quite unfortunately for Moronaga, he became a political enemy of the military strongman Taira no Kiyomori who initiated a Coup d'etat in the year of 1179 and took over the power in Japan. He was dismissed together with Kanpaku Matsudono Motofusa and once more exiled. Later, he forfeited all his titles and became a Buddhist monk in Owari province.

He became well known among Australian military circles, where he was affectionately known as \\"Roaring Reggie.\\" Early life Reginald Newton was born in the Sydney suburb of Balmain on 22 December 1906 to Charles and Mary Newton ( Knight). He joined the Australian military at 15 years of age as a camp cadet at Coonabarabran. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was a militia captain in the 5th Infantry Brigade at Parramatta. Battle of Singapore On 2 February 1941 Newton left for Singapore as headquarters company commander in the 2/19th Battalion, part of the 22nd Brigade, 8th Division. After arriving in Singapore, Captain Newton's battalion was sent north to Seremban in southern Malaya for training in tropical conditions. Eleven months later they engaged the invading Japanese when they were rushed forward to support the beleaguered 2/29th Battalion at Baku. Australian anti-tank gunners destroyed nine Japanese tanks in the Baku area. The 2/19th held a vital crossroad allowing the 2/29th and the 45th Indian Brigade to withdraw to Muar. Their action resulted in them being outflanked by superior numbers and they had to fight their way through a succession of Japanese roadblocks. The Australians' six-day clash with the crack 5th Imperial Guards Division was one of the epic encounters of the Malaya campaign. British commander Lieutenant General Arthur Percival, considered the delay they imposed had saved a large part of his army from being cut-off and annihilated at Yong Peng. With ammunition exhausted, casualties mounting and no chance of relief the 2/19th struck out through the jungle leaving wounded behind. It was later learned all the wounded were murdered by Lieutenant General Takuma Nishimura's Guards in what became known as the Parit Sulong Massacre. Nishimura was hanged in 1951 for war crimes. 2/19th commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Anderson was awarded the Victoria Cross for his courage and leadership. The Battle of Singapore came to an end on February 15 when Lieutenant General Percival surrendered British, Australian and Indian forces to General Tomoyuki Yamashita. Newton and his group of wounded men were still in the battle area. Their plan to escape was thwarted when they were betrayed by locals. They were eventually captured and taken to Kuala Lumpur's Pudu Jail, where Newton faced 60 hours of interrogation. He found that despite only being a captain, he was the highest ranking Australian officer at Pudu. He quickly decided that the best way to protect his men was to adopt practices not normally part of military routines. Trading with civilians and smuggling in extra food from the outside built trust among the prisoners of war. When he was moved from Pudu to Changi Prison his commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Galleghan, who did not approve of Newton's style or the way he had acted at Pudu. Despite a number of clashes between them it came as a surprise in March 1943 when Galleghan appointed Captain Newton to head U Battalion, D Force. This comprised 695 men mainly drawn from the 22nd Brigade. They left Changi and their destination turned out to be the Thai-Burma Railway in Kanchanaburi, Thailand. Newton's appointment meant he had jumped over many more senior officers. There was speculation that it could have been Galleghan's way of getting him out of Changi. Reputation The name \\"Roaring Reggie\\" came from the way he would shout at the Japanese guards. This subjected him to many beatings. Standing up for his men was Newton's main focus. He would do whatever was necessary to protect them and keep them alive. He found that feigning displays of respect for Warrant Officer Aitaro \\"Tiger\\" Hiramatusu, the Japanese camp commander, brought more benefits than acts of defiance. In an interview with Pattie Wright for her book The Men of the Line, Len, a 2/19th member recalled how Newton got on the \\"Tiger's\\" better side. \\"The 'Tiger' was a bad one but Reggie got around him. We saw comfort women come into our camp. They were in the last carriage of one of the trains going through. In fact \\"The Tiger\\" asked Reggie if he wanted women to come into the camp. I wasn't around for this exchange, but I heard Reggie said he'd prefer a few more bags of rice instead of women.\\" \\"A lot of times we thought he was going to get his head cut off,\\" one Australian said. \\"Everyone who was there would say that they got home because of Reg.\\" Another said: \\"We were lucky to have Reg Newton and that is evidenced by the fact that the casualties in D Force were one of the lowesthttp://www.pows-of-japan.net/articles/40.htm and it was definitely because of him.\\" His men realised his unorthodox measures gave them the best chance of survival. Of the 695 men in U Battalion,https://www.awm.gov.au/research/guide/pow-ww2-japan 33 died, all but one from illness. \\"He would chip Japanese guards if their uniforms were not up to standard and they were terrified of him,\\" a 2/19th member recalled. \\"If he went into a POW hut at one end they shot out at the other with cries of 'Argh, ichiban (number one) Australian!\\" Newton carried a mini radio concealed in a water bottle from 1942 to August 1945. He managed to smuggle it in by teaming up with another POW, Charles Edwards, who swapped bags with him, Newton planned a decoy and they swapped back. It was powered by batteries Newton purchased from Boonpong Sirivejjabhandu, a Thai canteen owner whose underground activities supported the POWs. Boonpong also provided medical supplies and was paid by Newton's personal promissory notes that were made good by the Australian Government at war's end. Newton Force On 1 July 1944 Newton commanded the \\"Newton Force\\" of 2,250 Australian, British, Dutch and American POWs who were moved from Thailand to the Ohama camp in Japan. Most of the ships carrying the POWs were sunk by American submarines.http://www.2-26bn.org/hellShips3.html The Americans were not aware the ships were carrying Allied POWs. On 4 July 1944 Newton left Singapore on board the Rashin Maru.https://japansekrijgsgevangenkampen.nl/Rashin%20Maru.htm The vessel was in such poor conditionhttp://searcharchives.vancouver.ca/s-s- rashin-maru the Australian POWs nicknamed it the Byoki Maru meaning \\"sick ship.\\" On board were 600 Australians, 300 Dutch and 165 British. The trip took 70 days. They avoided being torpedoed and dodging typhoons, arriving in Nagasaki on 8 September. Almost 12 months later it was torpedoed and sunk by the . After the war Newton went to Wilmington, North Carolina, and met with the retired submarine commander who had the Byoki Maru in his sights. He asked why they did not fire. \\"The ship you were on wasn't worth wasting a torpedo on,\\" was the reply.https://secondtwentiethbattalionaif.wordpress.com/prisoner- of-war-pow/prisoners-of-war-a-conference-on-the-Australian-experience In Japan Newton insisted that the Australian POWs got a proportionate number of good jobs, such as cooks. In August 1945 Newton's time as a captive of the Japanese came to an end. Signals from Allied Headquarters were dropped by aircraft into the camp ordering Newton to get his men out by train to Wakanoura, near Osaka, about 200 miles away. Gilbert Mant, writing in the Sydney Sun Herald said \\"'Roaring Reggie' roared up to the stationmaster, the chief of police and other high-ranking Japanese officials at Onada and demanded a train with eight carriages.\\" The Japanese wilted under the verbal barrage from the Australian officer but the stationmaster was adamant that no train would be permitted to leave unless Newton had signed a proper voucher for it. He signed with a flourish, then forgot all about it. Four months later he received an invoice at his Sydney home from the Japanese Railways for an amount totalling 7,250 yen. It called for 6,035 yen for 355 fares and 1,215 yen for the sleeping car that had been used for stretcher cases. Unlike Boonpong, the Thai canteen owner, the Japanese Railways were never recompensed. In 1945 the 2/19th Battalion was disbanded. Its casualty list was the highest of any Australian Army unit in the Second World War. At war crimes trials Newton testified that 68 men were beaten to death in digging Hellfire Pass. In August 1946 \\"The Tiger\\" faced justice. Warrant Officer Aitaro Hiramatsu along with another camp commander, Lieutenant Kishio Usuki, were charged with ill-treatment of POWs, including beatings, depriving them of food and medicine and forcing the sick to work. The war crimes trial in Singapore found them both guilty and they were sentenced to death by hanging.http://www.singaporewarcrimestrials.com/case- summaries/detail/073#case-anchor-defendants Honours Newton's elevation to lieutenant colonel also came through at war's end. In 1947 Newton was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire. The award citation read: \\"ARMY-Distinguished Service in the SW Pacific. He was brutally ill treated by Japanese guards while endeavoring to ameliorate the bad conditions for those under his command. His efforts on many occasions were directly responsible for saving many lives and casualties.\\" He was also awarded the Efficiency Decoration (ED) marking his twenty plus years of service \\"as a part-time efficient and thoroughly capable commissioned officer\\" in the Citizen Military Forces. Post-war After the war Newton devoted himself to the welfare of ex-POWs and in 1978 he was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia \\"for his work and service to the welfare of ex-servicemen.\\" In 1976 the 837-page history of Newton's unit was published. It was titled \\"The Grim Glory of the 2/19th Battalion AIF,\\"http://regimental-books.com.au/the-grim- glory-ofthe-219-battalion-aif-1st-edition-p-1168.html and Newton edited submissions from many of his fellow POWs. Newton died at the War Veterans' Home in Narrabeen, a Sydney suburb, on 31 July 1994. On 6 August, the Sydney Morning Herald described him as \\"the Protector of Death Railway POWs.\\" It said: \\"Reg Newton emerged as an outstanding leader in World War Two Japanese POW camps on the infamous Thai-Burma Railway.

Gold has always been used to show status amongst the deceased when used in grave goods. While there's evidence that the practice of grave goods and monumentalizing graves to show status was used throughout Ancient Greece from the Bronze Age and passed through the Classical Period, the goods themselves changed over time. However, using gold as a material was a constant status marker. At the Grave Circles in Mycenae, there were several grave goods found that were made out of gold; masks, cups, swords, jewelry, and more. Because there were so many gold grave goods found at this site there's a legend of Golden Mycenae. Each family group would add ostentatious grave goods to compete with the other family groups for who is the wealthiest. There was more gold found at Grave Circle A and B than in all of Crete before the late Bronze Age. Gold Masks and Cups 6257 - Archaeological Museum, Athens - Gold cup from Mycenae - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 10 2009 Heinrich Schliemann, a German archaeologist, excavated Mycenae in 1876. Of the six shaft graves in Grave Circle A, \\"The Mask of Agamemnon\\" was found in Grave V. In addition, six of the men found in the shafts of Grave Circle A were given gold masks, and then one child who was also found with a suit of gold had a gold mask. There were 7 masks found in Grave Circle B that had several similarities between them that led scholars to believe the faces were related. This suggest that there were different families buried in Grave Circle A, and that each wanted to boast their wealth and success over the other family. To make these masks they took crude gold and beat them into the shapes they wanted using a technique called repouss√©. The gold vessels found, mostly cups, were clear examples of status symbols. The craftsmen of the gold vessels also used repouss√©, which would require more work than a regular vessel. There was one specific gold cup found in Grave Circle A that resembles Nestor's Cup from Homer's Iliad. Even in death, families used gold for conspicuous displays of wealth. Gold Jewelry and Weapons Dagger inlaid Mycenaean 16 c BC, NAMA 394 1080834 cropped white bg The grave goods generally marked the difference between men and women. Women were found with gold jewelry, shrouds, and gold ornaments for dresses while men were found with gold masks, daggers, and swords. Several of the women's graves had gold diadems in them, and they were so fragile that the only use for them would be grave goods. All of these decorative gold grave goods were meant to be a sort of \\"status uniform\\" to distinguish their place in the community. For the most part these weapons were made to be art, and not used for battle. While there were some daggers in Grave Circle B, the majority of them came from Grave Circle A. Many of the daggers were actually made of bronze, but inlaid with gold using a Syrian technique called niello. One of the daggers found in Grave IV in Grave Circle A depicted a lion hunt, which may represent another status marker as the lion hunt was a motif that connected power and leadership. The dagger also contained certain aspects like the hunters wearing tall oxhide shields that were common in Greek frescoes. Another object found in shaft grave IV is a bull's head rhyton with gold horns and embellishments. Worshipping a bull was more of a Cretan practice, so this grave good implies influence of Cretan culture amongst the families in Mycenae. Rhyton bull's head Mycenaean, NAMA 384 080830 cropped white balanced sharpened 1000w Differences between Grave Circles A and B Grave circle B 3 The amount of luxury items found in both of the Mycenae Grave Circles was a true phenomenon. There are some scholars who believe that graves in the two Grave Circles represent two royal lines because the grave goods were of such high quality, but it has never been more than a speculation. Combined, the graves contained 5 generations over the years 1650-1500 BC, but Grave Circle B was started around 50 years before Grave Circle A. The majority found there were weapons and gold ornaments, and then the masks. Overall, the biggest difference between the gold grave goods is just that there are more found at Grave Circle A, but both of them show the amount of wealth that was abundant in Mycenae during the Bronze Age. The family groups that attributed to these graves made sure that those who died carried their status with them into death, and the use of gold was so ostentatious it brought even more attention to them.

The house was built in 1840 and added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 4, 1980. History Ebenezer Gould came to Owosso, Michigan in 1837 and established a grocery. He first lived in a small structure, but in about 1843 constructed this Greek Revival house, then located at 603 W. Main Street in Owosso. Gould later became a lawyer and was involved in the formation of the Owosso and Saginaw Navigation Company, which cleared the Shiawassee River for navigation. He fought in the Civil War, reaching the rank of colonel in the 5th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment. After returning to Owosso, he established a successful legal practice. The most prominent later resident of the Gould House was Lyman E. Woodard, who founded the Woodard Furniture and Casket Company. The house was purchased by the Storrer family in 1919. In 1991, the house was relocated to a local museum village, The Corunna Historical Village, to make room for a McDonald's. It was donated by the then-owners, the Storrer family, and is maintained by a volunteer group. Description The Ebenezer Gould House is a Greek Revival in style, constructed with an unusual T-shaped floorplan. The top of the T consists of a three bay wide single story section at the front of the house. This section contains a recessed main entryway, flanked by two nine-over-six double hung window units. The front is clad with clapboard, and has a gable roof with a broad fascia board below. A recessed porch supported by wood columns shelters the entryway. At the rear of the house is a two bay, two story section forming the base of the T-shaped floorplan. Two nine-pane windows are in the gable end above the front entrance.

Focusing on the palatial periods between c. 1900 and c. 1300 b.c. (Mid Bronze Age). Art that focuses on just scenes of war alone is impossible as there are many other references that can be made not relating to war at all. There are various meanings that can be interpreted from different perspectives and that is what Molloy wants readers to understand. There could be an overlap of religion, politics, social meanings added to an iconography of warfare. ‚ÄúPractitioners of violence‚Äù are called warriors, just an identity who performed their social acts depending on their society. These social acts ranges from bull-leaping, boxing, hunting, sports, combat, fighting and more. Malloy divides the art relating to warfare in Bronze Age Crete into four categories ‚Äúglyptic art circulating in both social and administrative contexts; stone and ceramic portable art for repeated intimate consumption (dining/processions); coroplastic/bronze figural art for religious activity; and frescoes and relief mouldings fixed in architectural settings‚Äù.  Seals  Seals are accessories worn by the person and these seals had images on them that could give information. One very popular scene is a man with a spear that is parallel to him vertically. The use of animal imagery, for example a lion showed could show internal traits such as bravery of the individual or the actual scene of killing/warfare. There are many variations of a man and a lion from scenes of lions hunting animals to man hunting the lions. Armors and weapons are also frequent in these seals and each can represent a symbol of some kind. For example, they can represent warfare and hunting, but also how the man is defending himself and his land.  Frescoes  Bull leaping was an activity for warriors Frescoes are bright wall paintings There were very few images of war in fresco art, however, the city of Knossos had many figural frescoes that could explain some form of war. Bull leaping fresco from Knossos is the most well known piece of artwork. As mentioned above, bull leaping was a sort of activity Minoan men did as a past time and it showed the interaction between the bull and man.  Akrotiri  Akrotiri was a Minoan Bronze Age settlement on the island of Thera now known as Santorini. Here were found well kept frescoes that has survived through all the years. Two young boys boxing, which is one of a warrior's lifestyle  Stone Vessels  37 stone vessels talked about by Logue. The Chieftain Cup from Aghia Triada features a tall male with a spear next to a shorter male with a sword, followed by three men with bull hides. These two armed figures of high status because of their weapons and their emphasis. The most vital of this piece is that the male body was carefully carved with incision as there are many details on the human body.

It has belonged to members of the Neergaard/Wedell-Neergaard family since 1751. History Church and Crown land Svenstrup is first mentioned in the 13th century when it belonged to a widow named Ingerd Sunesen. In the Middle Ages, Svenstrup was a farm under Antvorskov Abbey. In 1454, it was ceded to Roskilde Biscopic in exchange for other land. In 1623, Bishop Lauge Urne sided with Dyke Frederick in the conflict with Christian II. Shortly thereafter, Svenstrup was looted and burnt down by Niels Pedersen Halveg, one of the king's loyal men. After the Reformation in 1536, Svenstrup was confiscated by the crown and managed as a fief until 1666. Lensmen included Peder Basse (1615-18), Frederik Reedtz (1619-22) and Frederik Banner (1658-). The former fief was administrated by Johan Christoph von K√∂rbitz in 1662 to 1666.. Frederick II used it as a hunting lodge from 1577. A new main building with lavish interiors was completed in 1584 but he died in 1588. Svane family Hans Svane In 1666, Frederik III (1609‚Äì1670) gave Svenstrup to Hans Svane, an arch bishop, who had supported the king in the introduction of the absolutism in 1660. Svane was also appointed to Supreme Court justice and member of statskollegiet. The estate, then one of the largest in the country, was granted status as a birk from 1678. Hans Svane died later that year but his widow Marie Fuiren kept the estate until 1687. Hans and Margrethe Svane's granddaughter, Marie Svane, inherited Svenstrup in 1730. Her husband, Jesper Friis, had died in the Great Northern War (1700‚Äì1721). In 1733, she married the 20 years younger captain Frederik Oertz but the marriage was unhappy and after just a few years entered divorce proceedings that would last for the next 15 years and involve both Christian VI (1699‚Äì1746) and bishop Hersleb before the marriage was finally dissolved. Neergaard family Jens Bruun de Neergaard After the divorce, Frederik Oertz sold Svenstrup to Peter Johansen Neergaard who had been appointed to krigsr√•d. He managed the estate with great skill. His son, Jens Bruun Neergaard, constructed a new main building in 1780, the same year that he was ennobled under the name de Neergaard, and also expanded the estate through the acquisition of more land. Jens Bruun de Neergaard is also remembered for his literarydispute with the poet Johan Herman Wessel. Jens Bruun de Neergaard's widow, Anna Marie M√∏ller, kept the estate after his death in 1788. She implemented some of the agricultural reforms of the time in the years between 1791 and 1802 and bought Skjolden√¶sholm. Svenstrup Manor by Ferdinand Richardt In 1844, Johan Andreas de Neergaard turned Svenstrup into a fideikommis. His son Peter Christian Joachim Bruun de Neergaard took over Svenstrup in 1846 while the brother was given Skjoldn√¶seholm. The process of selling off tenant farms to the farmers did not begin until 1860 at Svenstrup. Joachim Wedell-Neergaard photographed by Julie Laurberg Peter Christian Joachim Bruun de Neergaard was succeeded by his grandson, Joachim Wedell, wgo was granted royal permission to carry the name Wedell-Neergaard. He sold the last tenant farms in the 1900s, making Svenstrup the last manor in the country to complete this process. The fideikommisgodser was dissolved as a result of lensafl√∏sningsloven in 1919. Joachim Wedell-Neergaard died in 1926. His widow Henny Caroline Julie Moltke passed the estate on to their son Christian Wedell-Neergaard in 1937. Today In April 2020, 29-year-old Maria Benedicte Wedell-Neergaard bought Svenstrup from her father for DKK 397 mio. with effect from 1 July 2020.

() is a manufacturing company in the People's Republic of China, engaged in the production of float glass, automobile glass and construction glass. It is one of the largest auto glass producers in the world, with customers including large international automobile manufacturers such as Ford, General Motors, Subaru and Volkswagen Group. It was established in 1987 as a joint venture company and is headquartered in Fuqing, Fujian. It was listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 1993 and on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2015.  History  Cao Dewang founded Fuyao in Fuqing, Fujian Province 1987 with several business partners. He had previous experience having taken over management of a glass factory owned by a local government. While there were few major buyers of automobiles at first, his company targeted the market of replacement glass for large numbers of imported vehicles into China. The name derives from the first character in the name of the city of Fuqing (Á¶è f√∫) and the Chinese word meaning \\"shine\\" (ËÄÄ y√†o). The company formed a joint venture with Saint-Gobain in 1996 with the French firm's 51 percent stake valued at $15.3 million. Three years later, Cao bought the stake back for $30 million. Fuyao became an original equipment manufacturer to General Motors in June 2006. Later that year, it signed an agreement with Goldman Sachs to sell 111 million new shares, to raise about ¬•890 million ($137 million). In March 2007, Fuyao landed a contract supplying Bentley. That year, foreign sales contributed ¬•5.17 billion, or almost $795 million, almost 28 percent of its sales that year. By that time, it was the fifth-largest maker of automotive glass in the world, with an estimated three percent market share, and held 60 percent market share of the automotive glass market in China.  Fuyao Glass America Inc.  In 2013, Fuyao began looking at establishing a factory presence in the United States, considering several sites in Ohio and Michigan before deciding on the former General Motors Moraine Assembly plant in Moraine, Ohio.\\"Moraine no longer home to former GM Assembly Plant; Site now officially home of Fuyao Glass America Inc\\". Englewood Independent. 5/15, 2014. Retrieved 4/17/2020. Its initial commitment to the factory, which was made public in January 2014, was to buy 1.4 million square feet of the plant from Industrial Realty Group and invest $240 million into an auto glass production facility, which would create 800 jobs. In 2014, it bought a float glass plant in Mount Zion, Illinois. In 2016, it announced an additional $131 million investment to add additional after-market glass lines at the plant, bringing it to 24 production lines. In exchange it received $6.6 million in incentives from JobsOhio. By then, the company planned to produce enough auto glass for 4 million to 5 million automobiles a year, taking advantage of contraction in the U.S. auto market during the Great Recession. By the time the plant entered full-scale production in October 2016, the company had invested $1 billion in the U.S. subsidiary, with long-term plans to grow to 5,000 employees in the United States. As of early 2020, Fuyao has opened additional operating facilities in Greenville, South Carolina and Detroit, Michigan. = Controversies = The plant saw some obstacles during the first two years of operation within the United States, including concerns about safety, inability to turn a profit, and politicizing employee concerns regarding the unionization of the Moraine Assembly plant's labor force. Additionally, conflicts arose from clashes in cultural norms and customs between the Chinese and American employees within the Moraine assembly. Shortly after the Moraine Assembly officially opened, the facility was cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for several critical safety violations, including the failure to provide protective equipment, the lack of HAZMAT training, and the failure to properly cover moving machinery. The infractions violated the Occupational Safety and Health Act (United States) of 1970, which prevents employers from knowingly exposing employees to hazardous work conditions. OSHA cited Fuyao for a total of thirteen different safety violations and fined the manufacturing firm approximately $725,000. Subsequently, they were met with a $7 million investment by Fuyao towards improving safety features throughout the Moraine Assembly plant. Additionally, Fuyao has since formed an environmental safety team within the Moraine assembly that provides in-depth training to the plant employees in both English and Mandarin Chinese. Since the majority of the labor force at Fuyao Glass America's Moraine Assembly plant had previously worked at the General Motors Moraine Assembly that was located on the same property, many workers wished to reform their connections with a major American labor union. A large portion of the plant's workforce organized and launched a campaign to form a union through the United Auto Workers, but company management promoted anti- union policies, hired anti-union organization contractors LRI to dissuade voters, and threatened union organizers with termination. A vote was held on the grounds of the Moraine plant, with anti-union voters defeating pro-union voters by a margin of 886 to 441. Following management's victory, several prominent pro-union employees and plant executives began to face workplace repercussions ranging from losses in hours to termination. Three pro-union employees, who had been terminated for reasons considered questionable by American cultural workplace standards, filed cases with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against the company, which settled the case in 2018 by agreeing to cover back pay and interest totaling $120,000. Complaints made to the NLRB included allegations of unfair labor practices. In addition, The settlement referenced the cases of four former employees, with allegations that included terminating workers, interrogating, harassing, and disciplining employees, refusing to hire employees with prior union ties, and constant changing of the company's terms and conditions of employment. The company was fined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration with regard to the safety concerns and addressed the processes in question. In 2018, after losing tens of millions of dollars per year, the plant turned its first annual profit. After the settlement was granted to the plaintiff employees, Fuyao Glass America President John Gauthier and Vice President Dave Burrows were terminated, with Fuyao's executive management citing the need to improve company efficiency. Burrows and Gauthier filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging that both executives were removed of both contract and employment without cause, prior notice, or explanation.

Some writers believe that the goal of human life can be found in history. Some writers believe that the meaning of life is in intense moments that leave life in chaos. However, Yoon looks at life from a different perspective. She would say that the meaning of life is in the moments. In other words, the true important purpose of life is in the feeling of the present, and the diverse emotions from it such as pain, sympathy, pity, and beauty. One literary critic has stated the characteristic of Yoon's fiction as following. \\"The reality depicted by Yoon Sung-hee in her stories draws readers in with its colorfulness of a sensual present. Readers do not draw the story to their own historical lives, but they choose to climb into the reality inside the story, and live along with the characters.\\"Yoon, Sung-hee, Yuteonjijeome bomuljidoreul mutda, Asia, 2014: 82. It can be said that Yoon's literary aim is to create a reading experience that breathes with the rhythm of life, using fiction as the subject.  Life  Yoon was born in 1973 in Suwon, Gyeonggi-do. She entered Cheongju University in 1991 and studied philosophy, but she spent more time on reading literary magazines then on her major, and once she realized that it gave her a strong sense of happiness, right after graduation she entered the Seoul Institute of the Arts for creative writing. She chose that course because she loved poetry, but after taking poetry classes, she was disappointed that her abilities were much lower than her expectations. However, she was unsuspectingly enjoying the fiction writing class. She spent all night writing a story for an assignment from professor Park Ki-dong who was teaching fiction writing at the time. She had felt an unknown passion then, and was attracted to fiction writing through that experience.\\"Looking at the World of Stories Beyond Reality: Writer Yoon Sung-hee\\", Webzine Arko. Yoon began her career as a writer when her short story \\"Legoro mandeun jib\\" (Î†àÍ≥†Î°ú ÎßåÎì† Ïßë A House Made of Legos) won The Dong-A Ilbo New Writer's Contest in 1999. Yoon has said that she always writes while remembering the words of the judges written for her selection for the new writer's contest, which were, we hope that this writer could become more original, and stronger. Originality, and the strength of fiction, or its ability to reach out to someone, became the most basic reasons for her drive behind writing fiction. 3 years after her debut, she published her first collection, Legoro mandeun jib (Î†àÍ≥†Î°ú ÎßåÎì† Ïßë A House Made of Legos), and then she published various collections up to 2017; Geogi, dangsin (Í±∞Í∏∞, ÎãπÏã†? Over There, Is It You?) in 2004; Gamgi (Í∞êÍ∏∞ Cold) in 2007; Utneun dongan (ÏõÉÎäî ÎèôÏïà While Laughing) in 2011; and Begereul beda (Î≤†Í≤åÎ•º Î≤†Îã§ Resting on a Pillow) in 2016. She has also published a novel, Gugyeongkkundeul (Íµ¨Í≤ΩÍæºÎì§ The Bystanders) in 2010. During this time, Yoon won the 50th Hyundae Literary Award with \\"Yuteonjijeome bomuljidoreul mutda\\" (Ïú†ÌÑ¥ÏßÄÏ†êÏóê Î≥¥Î¨ºÏßÄÎèÑÎ•º Î¨ªÎã§ Burying a Treasure Map At the U-turn Spot), the 2nd This Year's Art Prize in Literature with \\"Geogi, dangsin\\" (Í±∞Í∏∞, ÎãπÏã†? Over There, Is It You?), the 14th Isu Literature Prize with \\"Hadaman mal\\" (ÌïòÎã§Îßå Îßê Unfinished Words), the 11th Hwang Sun-won Literary Award with \\"Bumerang\\" (Î∂ÄÎ©îÎûë Boomerang), and the 49th Hankook Ilbo Literary Prize with \\"Begereul beda\\" (Î≤†Í≤åÎ•º Î≤†Îã§ Resting on a Pillow). Yoon's short story \\"Geu namjaui chaek 198 jjok\\" (Í∑∏ ÎÇ®ÏûêÏùò Ï±Ö 198Ï™Ω Page 198 of the Man's Book) was produced into a movie of the same name by director Kim Jung-kwon in 2008.  Writing  Yoon, who began her literary debut via a new writer's contest in 1999, is one of the most significant writers of Korean literature after 2000, due to her distinct periodic characteristics, and her works being clearly differentiated from earlier fiction. If South Korean fiction in the 1980s focused on the side of the public fighting against the country's ideology or being sacrificed due to oppression, South Korean fiction in the 1990s have strived for realizing the thesis of individual authenticity. Compared to this, South Korean fiction in the 2000s is reproducing the personalities of various individuals, and rich sensations of reality. First, one of the characteristics of fiction by Yoon Sung-hee is her sensitivity to visual details. Hwang Jong-yeon has said that Yoon is a \\"writer of the polaroid generation, who has grown up with the marvels of camera technology\\", and describes that \\"the founding idea of the meticulous descriptions that are prevalent across Yoon's fiction, is that something visual (expression, behavior, action, the views) correlated with something intangible (experiences, mind, the truth), and that it is the most realistic correlation. While thoroughly depicting the many actions and events that form a person's everyday life, Yoon Sung-hee focuses on the special moments when those elements turn into the representation of the reality, or the true form of that person's life. The lives of individuals that Yoon Sung- hee depicts have small area of activity, and lacks content, but the details are always preparing a small wonder, in which hidden desires, relationships, and situations that the individual may not express, or may not have known, are realized.\\"Hwang, Jong-yeon, \\"The Realism of Desublimation\\", Criticism for Debauchery, Munhakdongne, 2012: 229. Another characteristic of Yoon's fiction is her view that captures the \\"patterns of a capitalistic life\\". Literary critic Kim Yeong-chan has said that \\"The characteristic, as well as a strength, of Yoon Sung-hee's fiction, is that even as she vividly lays out the individual living situations within the unhandsome peripheral modernity, she does not color it with another ideological narrative, or romanticizes it too rashly.\\" And he adds that \\"meanwhile, the writer carefully captures the various patterns of individualistic lives, where people endure the harsh living of late modernity through self positivity as a dignified individual that cannot be reduced in any way.\\"Yoon, Sung-hee, Yuteonjijeome bomuljidoreul mutda, Asia, 2014: 90.

The band was created by singer and frontman Chris Harms.  History  Lord of the Lost was founded in mid-2007 by Chris Harms as a solo project. While working on the initial songs and publishing them on MySpace, Harms received a lot of positive reception and realized that he would require a full band to play them live. He recruited other musicians from his friends in the Hamburg music scene to form the band and begin working on the first album. Harms originally called the project Lord, but changed the name of the band to Lord of the Lost to avoid possible name disputes with Lordi and The Lords. Before Lord of the Lost, Harms was a singer and guitarist of the rock band Philiae (1999-2004), a guitarist and second singer with the Glam-Metal-Band The Pleasures (2004-2007), as well as a musician on various projects like Big Boy or Unterart. The debut single Dry The Rain was released in 2009 and the debut album Fears was released in 2010 with the independent label Out of Line. While recording the second album Antagony Lord of the Lost went on an extended tour through 2010 which included international shows and festivals such as the Wave-Gotik-Treffen, the Wacken Open Air and the M'era Luna Festival. In spring 2011, the band released Sex on Legs as the first single from their second album, Antagony. The album, considered their first concept album, was released shortly thereafter. Lord of the Lost toured in support of the album with the band Mono Inc. on their Viva Hades tour. In summer 2012, Lord of the Lost released their third album Die Tomorrow. Just before the release, the band began working on their fourth album From The Flame Into The Fire. In October 2012, Lord of the Lost opened for Letzte Instanz on their Ewig-Tour. Lord of the Lost started touring again in the spring of 2013 co-headlining on the Darkness Kills tour with Unzucht, and in September kicked off the We are the Lost tour together with Lost Area. In October 2013, Lord Of The Lost appeared as part of the Gothic Meets Klassik at the Leipzig Gewandhaus with the Zielona G√≤ra Symphony Orchestra. In February 2014, drummer Christian Schellhorn left the band and was replaced by Tobias Mertens. In March 2014, the band played their first US tour, which was financed by crowdfunding. Within two months fans and sponsors raised $12,775, surpassing the original goal of $10,000. In March 2015, Lord of the Lost released the pure acoustic album Swan Songs, which reached #34 on the GfK Entertainment Charts. The live performances for the album took place on the Out of Line Weekender in Berlin in the same month. In 2015, Lord of the Lost released the EP Full Metal Whore. The tour for the album used the motto \\"Make Love Make War\\" and was supported by the bands Darkhaus, Eyes Shut Tight, Vlad In Tears, and Erdling. In December 2015 they released A Night To Remember - Live Acoustic In Hamburg, the DVD and live CD from the acoustic tour during the previous spring. The first single \\"The Love of God\\" from the album Empyrean was released in May 2016. This was followed by the band's first major European tour Make Europe Great Again (M.E.G.A.) with Combichrist, Filter, and (at the German concerts) Rabia Sorda. Empyrean was published at the end of July 2016 and is the second concept album from the band. The band followed Empyrean with their open air concert premiere as The Lord Of The Lost Ensemble, an acoustic-classical band supported by classical musicians and the former drummer Christian \\"Disco\\" Schellhorn. In December 2016, guitarist Bo Six announced that he would be leaving the band for professional and private reasons. In early January 2017, the band announced their new guitarist œÄ (Pi). In July 2017, Tobias Mertens announced that, for private and professional reasons, he would be taking a time-out from Lord Of The Lost. Niklas Kahl has stepped in as drummer for live performances. Lord of the Lost performed with KMFDM on the United Kingdom leg of KMFDM's \\"Hell Yeah\\" tour with Inertia during September 2017. The band planned to join KMFDM on the United States portion of the \\"Hell Yeah\\" tour with ohGr starting in October 2017. Chris Harms and œÄ were to be playing guitar on stage with KMFDM during the tour, in addition to their Lord of the Lost set. Lord of the Lost was forced to withdraw from KMFDM's United States tour when they were not issued visas by the U.S. government.  Styles  Lord of the Lost produces music across several genres including heavy metal and glam rock influenced dark rock, industrial music, and classical music. In interviews with the magazine Orkus and the website Subexistance, Chris Harms has cited bands such as Rammstein, Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, and Lady Gaga as some of the many performers that he listens to and is influenced by.  Reception  Although it has not always been received as highly innovative, the debut album Fears received an overall positive critique by the music press. The music Magazine Sonic Seducer praised not only the ‚Äúpleasant deep promising vocals‚Äù but also the ‚Äúdark, melodramatic moments‚Äù and described the album as ‚Äúdark m√©lange of music styles which give the album a fresh and great variety‚Äù. In Zillo the debut has been described as ‚Äúnot really original or ground-breaking‚Äù but it has been praised for its ‚Äúhard and unconditional songs‚Äù. Orkus, however, wrote that they have waited a long time for an album ‚Äúso interesting and rich in variety‚Äù. Metal.de described the album as ‚Äúabsolutely okay‚Äù but suggested to listen to some songs before buying the album because it might be ‚Äútoo hard for some, and too soft for others‚Äù.

By 2010 village redevelopment activities were implemented from 1341 locations. See Vorstand & Organisation > Dorferneuerungsvereine for a list of villages.

Despite the Jim Crow era leading to major migration to the North and West, the majority of the Black population remains concentrated in the Southern states, and have heavily contributed to the cultural blend (Christianity, foods, art, music (see spiritual, blues, jazz and rock and roll)) that characterize Southern culture today. History African Americans accounted for nearly 44.99% of the Southern population through the early 20th century.  Origins  The history of African-Americans in the South dates back to 1619, when the first ship containing African-Americans for slavery was headed towards San Juan, Mexico was intercepted by two pirate ships expecting to steal precious metals like gold and silver. To their surprise, the ship had 350 Africans from The Kingdom of Ndongo, on the Kwanza River in north central Angola. The Pirates took 60 of the best and healthiest slaves to the English colony of Jamestown with the hopes of selling them to the manpower-deprived city. The settlers of Jamestown purchased 32 (17 men and 15 women) people with the hopes that the free labor would help expand the colony. They worked wherever they were needed up until 1705. Between this time and the American Revolutionary War in 1775, more African-Americans were brought to the colonies as they expanded rapidly.  Revolutionary War ‚Äì Jim Crow era  African Americans played arguably the most vital role in America gaining independence from Britain. After suffering from ongoing oppression, they saw it as an opportunity to break free from slavery and unfair treatment. Many leaders, such as Thomas Jefferson, made promises to African Americans about gaining freedom once a new country was created. During the war, Blacks fought for both sides, whichever they thought would have the best chance of granting them their freedom. During the war, George Washington banned Blacks from fighting for the Congressional Army (American). Soon after, Washington knew his forces were slacking, and he reinstated them. Even though they were essential to winning many battles, and arguably the war, blacks were not given their freedom‚Äînot even by Thomas Jefferson. The victory in the American Revolution began the emancipation movement which was the act of some northern states adopting emancipation as a part of a promise with the Declaration of Independence.  Jim Crow era  Following for roughly 200 years, Blacks especially in the South suffered from racial oppression in the form of slavery, segregation, and lynchings. Jim Crow laws are a huge part of African- American history, which legalized segregation in states that had maintained slavery through the 18th century after the emancipation proclamation. Fully in place in 1910, this reinstated white supremacy and cut many borders that Blacks worked so hard to gain. These laws involved \\"separate but equal\\" clauses which legally split apart the lives of Blacks from white in public places like schools, bathrooms, and transportation, often with them receiving the worse accommodation. Civil rights Racial segregation was commonplace in the South until the 1960s. The South witnessed two major events in the lives of 20th century African Americans: the Great Migration and the American Civil Rights Movement. The first Great Migration began from World War I to 1940, with the second wave hitting its high point during World War II and post-World War II economic boom until 1970. During both migrations, five million Blacks left their homes in the South for Northern and Western states to find work in private and public sectors of the economy as well as wanting to leave racial segregation, lynching, bigotry, violence, and disenfranchisement in the South behind. Upon arriving in the North and West, Black migrants surprisingly faced widespread racial discrimination there, due to being perceived as competitors for jobs and housing, as well as lowering property values of white residents. Despite this, the conditions in the North and West were still somewhat miles ahead from the South, such as having a right to vote, sending children to better schools, and getting paid more in skilled and unskilled jobs.Katzman, 1996 The migration also empowered the growing Civil Rights Movement. While the movement existed in all parts of the United States, its focus was against disenfranchisement and the Jim Crow laws in the South. Most of the major events in the movement occurred in the South, including the Montgomery bus boycott, the Mississippi Freedom Summer, the march on Selma, Alabama, and the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. In addition, some of the most important writings to come out of the movement were written in the South, such as King's \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\". Most of the civil rights landmarks can be found around the South. The Martin Luther King, Jr., National Historic Site in Atlanta includes a museum that chronicles the American Civil Rights Movement as well as Martin Luther King, Jr.'s boyhood home on Auburn Avenue. Additionally, Ebenezer Baptist Church is located in the Sweet Auburn district as is the King Center, location of Martin Luther and Coretta Scott King's gravesites. The Civil Rights Movement essentially ended Jim Crow laws across the South. A third migration appears to be underway, with African Americans from the North and West moving to the South in record numbers. While race relations are still a contentious issue in the South, the region surpasses the rest of the country in many areas of integration and racial equality. According to 2003 report by researchers at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, Virginia Beach, Charlotte, Houston, Nashville-Davidson, and Jacksonville were the five most integrated of the nation's fifty largest cities, with Memphis at number six. Southern states tend to have a low disparity in incarceration rates between Blacks and whites relative to the rest of the country. (Report.)  Segregation  In reference to the location of Blacks within the South, and why they have remained there so long, Jimmie Lewis Franklin states how Pan-Africanist values and prolonged discrimination may have inspired continuous migration of Blacks from the South. He states that while many African Americans decided to relocate in search of a better life, many choose to stay, not due to a submission to racism, but out of the basic human desire to remain in an established home. Following slavery and the civil war, black southerners continued to suffer oppression through segregation which determined the hospitals people were born in, the schools in which children were educated, and even dictated which graveyard people were buried in. Blacks and whites were held to different legal standards with two criminal justice systems in existence to maintain the separation of law and expectation. In instances of law breaking, the Ku Klux Klan, in tandem with law officers, would instigate violence and brutality on black citizens. The 14th and 15th amendments, that all people born in the United States are American citizens and furthermore, that no state government is permitted to deny a citizen the right to vote based on race or previous enslavement, were both nullified in 1883. The Montgomery Improvement Association was formed in 1955, with Martin Luther King Jr. as president, after Rosa Parks was arrested for sitting in the white section of a public city bus. The Association organized carpooling for Blacks as well as weekly prayer groups, and, in 1956, it was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. James Meredith was the first African American student to attend the University of Mississippi, on October 1, 1962, because the governor of the state of Mississippi, Ross Barnett, withheld the student's ability to register in September and was convicted of civil contempt. He complied and faced no major charges but had he refused to halt his interference, he would have been arrested and a $10,000 fine per day would have been ordered. However, a riot ensued when Meredith arrived on campus and President John F. Kennedy was inclined to send men from the National Guard to Oxford, Mississippi where two people were killed and 200 were injured. Within the same year, the governor of Alabama, George Wallace, stood symbolically at the door of the University of Alabama to protest the admittance of two black students, James Hood and Vivian Malone, in an attempt to keep them from enrolling in the university. Reporters were invited to witness this protest during his reelection campaign in which Nicholas Katzenbach, Deputy Attorney General, stated that Wallace was unauthorized to do so, and he eventually stepped down. Reconstruction, or the process of the United States transforming into a country without slavery in which all prior slaves would become citizens, angered many southern whites that highly opposed black citizens having a right to vote. White southerners, who lost their slaves, feared Black involvement in politics claiming concern for a \\"Negro supremacy,\\" in that their numbers would give them the majority of votes when in reality, Blacks never controlled the south politically.  Protest  A big part of the civil rights movements of the south was Nonviolent protest. Organizations were formed around the idea of nonviolence. More often than not, the reasoning behind the nonviolence was religion, and the belief that everyone should be treated with love. It was also thought that violent protest would never gain the needed moment, despite the fact that their protests were often disbanded with intense police violence. These nonviolent protests were also drawn from the work of Gandhi. Leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. were rooted in the nonviolent protest backed by religious morals and the ideals of Gandhi. These ideals paired with the minds of civil rights leaders drove the movement. The Montgomery bus boycotts were a major event in the nonviolent protest civil rights movement, King the leader of this protest. He stressed the importance of nonviolence in gaining the respect of the oppressor. The Montgomery bus boycotts helped birth organizations that were embedded in nonviolence. They were the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Segregation was finally put to a stop 1954 with the Supreme Court ruling of Brown vs The Board of Education. In this ruling, the Supreme Court overruled the \\"separate but equal\\" ruling of Plessy vs Ferguson in 1896. The 1954 Supreme Court ruling came about after 13 parents took to the courts to end racial segregation when their students were not admitted into the white school in their neighborhood. Segregation was a huge part of southern life. It was everywhere; restaurants, restrooms, and water fountains were segregated- to name a few. Segregation was supposed to be \\"separate but equal\\", but it was not. Knowing this, the Supreme Court ruled to overrule Plessy vs Ferguson. Culture  Music  Blues, a genre of music, originated from songs that slaves would sing called 'sorrow songs'. Blues mostly existed deep in the south and mostly in small towns like Memphis and New Orleans. Blues often consisted of a sole singer with an instrument, usually guitar expressing their emotions. Blues music generally comes from the inspiration of love, sex, betrayal, poverty, bad luck, and lifestyles that are less than ideal. Jazz music originated in New Orleans in the 1910s. Blacks and Whites made music that would flow together to mix cultures and aspects of European music as well as American music. Jazz was created as a different type of Blues music. Blues was considered to be of more lower class status while Jazz was more stylized. Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles were big in the world of Jazz music. In the 1960s, a new type of music called Funk emerged into the music scene. Funk is a type of music that brings soul and energy. It is significantly well known for the use of the electric bass guitar and are songs that are long and enable people to dance. James Brown was notable for Funk. Michael Jackson was notorious for blending the music of Funk and Soul together to create a successful and popular genre of music that stemmed from old Jazz and Motown. Rap music was created by using the pent up anger from the civil rights movement. The biggest inspiration for rap music is soul music. Rap music and Hip-hop music are often interchangeable. Hip-hop, however, covers wider variety of topics and stems from different energy. In the 1990s a new form of rap emerged called Gangsta Rap. Then came rap rivalries of the East coast and West coast. In the 20th century, Gospel music originated through Black and white cultures to create soulful and deep energy through music that also includes dance. The combination of music from Black and white groups to create a blend of Protestant hymns and African styles to become two popular sectors of music that could harmoniously coexist. Black gospel music started creating their own trends by creating duo's and choirs and competing worldwide in traveling singing groups. Eventually this led to the combination of whites and Blacks creating groups, however they remained distinctly separate.  Religion  After the Civil War, there was a great divide in religion in the south. Blacks found themselves between the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the National Baptist Convention. They would barely be found in historically white churches. By 1906, the National Baptist Convention had over 61% of the Black church community. From 1890 till 1906, the population of Black churchgoers increased by one million. Evangelical individualism was no longer wanting to be segregated by the Blacks and whites, therefore the Black Catholics moved away from Louisiana. Although the Catholic church made it seem as if the Blacks were welcome, they were hesitant to join because they knew of all segregation laws in Catholic Churches. Martin Luther King Jr. is one of the African American preachers that helped evolve religion in the south. There has been exceeding growth of religions in the south. There has been introductions of Catholic, Jewish, Hindu, and Buddhist religions in the urban southern communities. In 1999, more than 1 out of 5 people considered themselves to be in a religion outside of Protestantism. African Americans made up 39% of the people who are affiliated with a religion other than Protestantism. Judaism has also emerged in the south to promote and encourage blacks because they have also been ridiculed for having their synagogues in the south. In 2000 the city of Atlanta had 10,000 Buddhists, 12,000 Hindus, and 30,000 Muslims.  Food  The south is known for many foods, many of which contain African American influences. George Washington Carver, a botanist from Missouri had made many discoveries regarding the peanut. The United Peanut Associations of America reached out to Carver to discuss Carvers many advances using the peanut. Carver gave a discussion regarding the peanut and all the things that are able to be done with a peanut. _Popular southern dishes:_ Sweet: * Pecan Pie * Mississippi Mud Pie * Peach Cobbler * Moon Pie thumb Savory: * Cornbread * Pulled pork * Grits * Jambalaya * Deviled eggs * Fried Chicken  Professionalism and jobs  The African American job market has significantly changed in the last fifty years. Previously almost all African American were impoverished. This rate has significantly improved. Today more than 40% of African Americans consider themselves to be in the middle class. They previously had ill-paid, manual jobs such as sharecroppers, laborers, or any other jobs that white men wouldn't take. A majority of African American women worked as servants who were paid even worse than males. Fifty years ago, 6 out of 10 African American women worked as servants. Today, the African American job industry is one of the fastest entrepreneurial groups in the United States. Over half of the black population in America works a white-collar job. The income gap between Blacks and whites has been cut about a third. Although the gap isn't equal yet, two parent Black families earn 13% less than two parent white families.  Black suburbs  After the Great Migration's end, many Black people moved back to the South. The economy in the South became booming. The expanding economy and improved racial climate brought more Black people back to the South. Primary destinations are states such as Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, Tennessee, and Florida.William H. Frey (May 2004). \\"The New Great Migration: Black Americans' Return to the South, 1965-to the present\\". Brookings Institution. brookings.edu. Retrieved July 10, 2017. African Americans began moving to the suburbs seeking out safer and more comfortable housing. There is a common misconception that much of the African American population lives in the ghetto in high rise, government provided housing, when really over 33% live in the suburbs. While both white and Black families live in suburbia, the neighborhoods seemingly are very separated. Many of the middle class African American families live in all Black suburbias. The African American middle class continues to grow, with more than 40% of the Black middle class population owning a home.

The fire was started on September 2, 2017, by a 15-year-old boy igniting fireworks during a burn ban. The fire burned 50,000 acres,https://tdn.com/lifestyles/outdoors/work-to-restore-trails-damaged-by- eagle-creek-fire-underway/article_f366e5bf-86e5-5ffe-b89f-885bb680e80f.html and burned for three months, before being declared completely contained. As of May 29, 2018, it was found still smoldering in some areas.Eagle Creek Fire flares up in Columbia Gorge, firefighters on scene - Statesman Journal Statesman Journal ‚Ä∫ 2018/05/29 Timeline By September 28, 2017, the fire had consumed and was 46% contained. In late October, fire growth was slowed by rain. On November 30, 2017, the fire was declared fully contained but not yet completely out. In mid-September 2017, highway closures and local evacuations were gradually being lifted. A six mile stretch of the Historic Columbia River Highway between Bridal Veil and Ainsworth State Park, a section providing access to many popular scenic destinations such as Multnomah Falls, remained closed until November 2018. About 9,000 trees in danger of falling on the road were cut, and more than 3,000 feet of protective fencing was installed before the historic road was deemed safe for public travel, according to the Oregon Department of Transportation. Several popular hiking trails were reopened to the public in November 2018, but as of May 2019, many trails heavily damaged by the fire remain closed, and officials with the U.S. Forest Service say there's no timeline for when some will reopen. \\"Some areas may stay closed for years,\\" said Rachel Pawlitz, public information officer with the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area. These heavily damaged trails include the very popular Horsetail Falls, Wahclella Falls, Oneonta Gorge, and Eagle Creek Trails, among others. Cause On September 5, Oregon State Police announced that it had identified the person suspected of starting the wildfire, through the use of fireworks that were illegally set off, as a 15-year-old boy from Vancouver, Washington. A witness reported seeing a group of teenagers recording the fireworks being lit and thrown into Eagle Creek Canyon. It was announced on September 8 that Oregon State Police had obtained cellphone video footage from one of the teenagers who had watched while a 15-year-old Vancouver boy threw a smoking firecracker, allegedly igniting the Eagle Creek Fire. Public Information Officer Capt. Bill Fugate says \\"the video will be released through the public records request process once the investigation is closed and the case is adjudicated, if charges are filed\\", reported Willamette Week. The teen was sentenced in February 2018 to five years of probation and 1,920 hours of community service with the U.S. Forest Service. He also was ordered to write apology letters to 152 people trapped on the Eagle Creek trail because of the spreading flames, the city of Cascade Locks, the Forest Service, Oregon State Parks, the Oregon Department of Transportation, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, the Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commission and many others. On May 21, 2018, a judge ordered the 15-year old to pay more than $36 million in restitution, which includes more than $21 million on behalf of the U.S. Forest Service, $12.5 million to the Oregon Department of Transportation, more than $1.6 million to the Oregon State Fire Marshal, more than $1 million to Union Pacific Railroad and varying amounts to Oregon State Parks, Allstate Insurance and a woman who lost her home in the fire. In his sentencing, Judge John A Olsen stated that the terms of the repayment were for a payment plan lasting for ten years, provided that the offender completed five years of probation and did not commit any crimes in the ten-year period. Events Trees along Interstate 84, near Cascade Locks, show burnt bark in June 2018. The Eagle Creek Fire was reported on September 2 at 4:00p.m. in the Columbia River Gorge. By the morning of September 3, the fire had grown to . On September 5, the fire hopped over the Columbia River into Washington state, near Archer Mountain. The fire trapped 153 hikers and forced them to stay overnight six miles up the trail, trapped on the other side by the Indian Creek Fire. The first rescuer, a Forest Service ranger named Sharon, reached the hikers around 10p.m. An attempt to drop supplies to the hikers, and to airlift out the youngest children, was aborted because the narrow terrain and night made the maneuver too hazardous. The hikers‚Äîwho generally had been on a hot summer day hike‚Äîhuddled together and tried to sleep on the bare ground. Several additional staff from the Forest Service arrived overnight with space blankets and some provisions. The next morning, Pacific Northwest Search and Rescue, along with Mountain Wave Search and Rescue, escorted the hikers out to Wahtum Lake and bussed them back to the Eagle Creek Trailhead. The community of Cascade Locks, Oregon was the first to experience mandatory evacuations, with 283 structures, including 15 businesses, being threatened by the fire. Salmon hatcheries at Cascade Locks were forced to release 600,000 fish six months earlier than expected. The fire also threatened historic structures in the Eagle Creek Day Use Area, specifically those built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. The fire also threatened the Multnomah Falls Lodge, which was saved by water tenders. As of September 27, the Eagle Creek Fire had burned and was 46% contained. Rainfall during previous days had significantly contained and newly downgraded the fire. The Incident Command Post was relocated from Hood River County Fairgrounds to the Best Western Columbia River Inn in Cascade Locks. Merge of Eagle Creek and Indian Creek Fires In the early hours of September 6, the Eagle Creek Fire merged with the Indian Creek Fire. Fire officials estimated that, together, over 31,000 acres were actively burning. The Office of the Oregon State Fire Marshal issued the following statement: The following day, September 7, circumstances led Simmons to update his statement to \\"There is significant damage to the trails... it's going to take a while for them to recover.\\" Air quality downgrades Westward winds blew smoke and up to one inch of ash on the Portland metro area during 4 and 5 September. Air quality was officially reduced to an \\"unhealthy\\" rating due to smoke and falling ash, forcing many schools to close or cancel outdoor activities. On Friday, September 15, smoky conditions resumed throughout the Portland Metro area, accompanied by far less falling ash than previously, but downgrading air quality to an \\"unhealthy\\" rating again on Saturday, 16 September. Shifting wind conditions and subsequent rain on Sunday, September 17 cleared skies and aided in fire containment. Many schools were also affected by smoke, causing children to miss school on many occasions. Evacuations and closures Onlookers watching the fire from the Columbia River Gorge, September 4 Multnomah Falls Lodge surrounded by smoke, September 5 Cascade Locks, Oregon was the first area of mandatory evacuation. As of September 5, a number of communities in the area were added to mandatory evacuation. In Multnomah County, mandatory evacuation orders were in place for Larch Mountain, and the communities of Latourell, Bridal Veil, Dodson, Warrendale, and East Corbett. \\"Get Set\\" evacuations were in place for Corbett and Springdale. An evacuation shelter was established at Mt. Hood Community College. The Columbia River itself was also closed to all marine traffic for 20 miles, from mile marker 126 to 146. The I-84 corridor from Troutdale, Oregon to Hood River, Oregon, continued to be an active evacuation zone as of September 12. A total of 400 residences were under mandatory evacuation notices. In Hood River County, mandatory evacuations are in place for all areas south of Interstate 84 in Cascade Locks. The rest of Cascade Locks was at \\"Get Set\\" evacuation level on September 5. Meanwhile, in Skamania County, Washington, there were mandatory evacuations for Archer Mountain Road, Smith Crops and Deville Road. Mabee Mines Road was also at a \\"Get Set\\" evacuation level at that time. As of September 9, 2017, the Oregon State Fire Marshal (OSFM) task force was on alert for potential evacuation of Lost Lake and Mitchell Point.InciWeb: News Release \\"Eagle Creek Fire - Evening Update 9/9/17\\" In mid-September 2017, highway closures and local evacuations were gradually being lifted.[9] A six mile stretch of the Historic Columbia River Highway between Bridal Veil and Ainsworth State Park, a section providing access to many popular scenic destinations such as Multnomah Falls, remained closed until November 2018.

The fire, which was caused by a lightning strike and first reported on July 12, 2017. It burned as of November 4, when it was declared 100% contained. The Chetco Bar Fire area is subject to warm, dry winds known as the Brookings effect (also known as Chetco Effect), driven by high pressure over the Great Basin. The fire re-burned portions of the 2002 Biscuit Fire and the 1987 Silver Fire. The fire directly impacted communities surrounding it, causing mandatory evacuations. It also impacted local viewing of the Solar eclipse of August 21, 2017. Events The Chetco Bar Fire was started by a lightning strike in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness near the Chetco River. It was reported on July 12, 2017 at 1:45 PM. By July 15, it was primarily burning in the scar of the 2002 Biscuit Fire and had only burned . At this time, fire crews expressed concerns about accessing the fire due to difficult and dangerous terrain. By July 20, it was determined that the fire had actually burned over . Up until this day, the crews were not using technology to gather acreage data, but estimates. As a precautionary response, the Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest closed select forest service roads and trails. As of August 2, the fire had expanded to . Fears of an upcoming heatwave led to the creation of public use restrictions on fires in the area. By August 9, three additional trails were closed and on August 12, additional use restrictions were put in place regarding campfires and smoking. On August 19, the fire, in Brookings effect wind, had spread and the first mandatory evacuations were put in place - for the top of Gardner Ridge Road and Cate Road past Hazel Camp area, Wilson Creek area, and along the Chetco River 3 miles up the North Bank Chetco River Road from Social Security Bar to the wilderness retreat area. Another mandatory evacuation was put in place, on August 21, for areas between Highway 101 and Carpenterville Road, north to the Pistol River. Six days later, on August 24, the fire remained uncontained and had burned , burning in steep and rugged terrain about five miles north of Brookings, Oregon. The smoke from the fire began impacting visibility along Highway 101 and creating dramatic hazes in Gold Beach and in Brookings. By August 30, the National Guard had joined the fire fighting efforts. Entering September, the fire continued to burn with mandatory evacuations being put in place all residents on Illinois River Road within US Forest Service Boundaries, including the Oak Flat community. As of September 10, the fire was at and was 5% contained. The fire had spread into Curry County. In Josephine County, crews began structure assessments of the communities of O'Brien, Cave Junction, and Selma. Governor Kate Brown, US Forest Service Chief Tony Tooke, Senator Ron Wyden, Major General Michael Stencel, and House Representative Peter DeFazio visited the fire camp. The fire was announced as being 100% contained on November 2. Impact Member of the Burned Area Emergency Response team inspecting a forest road damaged by the fire. The Checto Bar Post-Fire Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team completed their evaluation of the fire's impact on October 11, 2017. The Chetco Bar Fire damaged over of land, the majority of which was US Forest Service land and private land. The fires burned of redwood tree stands, with being 75 to 100 percent completely destroyed. BAER reported that the probability of damage and loss of soil resources is \\"very high and high,\\" due to the high soil burn severity in and substantial loss of stored carbon, which serves as the long term nutrient supply for vegetation and microfauna. Geological hazards are also of concern, including rock falls, landslides, debris flows, slope failures, and soil erosion. Hillslopes have lost much of their overstory, ground cover, and roughness causing a decline in water storage, which increases the likelihood of flooding. Coho salmon habitats have seen increases in debris. Regarding human risk, BAER reported concerns with roads and rivers, streams and creeks. 136 miles of roads received fire treatment, including debris removal and repairing water culverts. 18.5 miles of trails received fire treatment, primarily to assist with water drainage. Recreational sites saw signage placement for warning the public about safety concerns, tree removal, hazardous waste clean up and some properties have been closed. The highest concern recreation areas are SF Chetco, Mineral Hill Fork Creeks, Eagle Creek and Panther Creek. Cultural values were found to be at risk after the fire, with heritage sites experiencing low to high intensity effects to the surrounding vegetation. Sites impacted include the Wheeler Ridge Japanese Bombing Site, the Quail Prairie Mountain Lookout and a prehistoric Native American site. The Chetco Bar Fire's impacts on wildlife has been reported as \\"high\\" in the Eagle Creek area of the Chetco River. Forest wide, 26 nest patches of northern spotted owls were impacted with 85 percent sustaining moderate to high burn intensities. 37 percent of suitable marbled murrelet nesting habitat was burned at moderate to high severity. BAER reported concerns with municipal water supplies in Brookings and Harbor, primarily with intakes experiencing channel scour during high peak flow events. Port of Brookings Harbor experienced increased debris and sediment during winter 2017.

Importantly, negative evidence does not show what is grammatical; that is positive evidence. In theory, negative evidence would help eliminate ungrammatical constructions by revealing what is not grammatical. Direct negative evidence refers to comments made by an adult language-user in response to a learner's ungrammatical utterance. Indirect negative evidence refers to the absence of ungrammatical sentences in the language that the child is exposed to. There is debate among linguists and psychologists about whether negative evidence can help children determine the grammar of their language. Negative evidence, if it is used, could help children rule out ungrammatical constructions in their language.  Direct negative evidence  Direct negative evidence in language acquisition consists of utterances that indicate whether a construction in a language is ungrammatical. Direct negative evidence differs from indirect negative evidence because it is explicitly presented to a language learner (e.g. a child might be corrected by a parent). Direct negative evidence can be further divided into explicit and implicit forms. Explicit forms of evidence involve a parent telling their child that an utterance was incorrect and then supplying the correct version of that utterance. Implicit forms involve the repetition (or a modified repetition) of a child's ungrammatical utterance. On the other hand, indirect negative evidence is used to determine ungrammatical constructions in a language by noticing the absence of such constructions.  Explicit direct negative evidence  A corpus study found that explicit negative evidence was \\"very rare\\", and concluded that because parents do not reliably correct their children's grammatical errors, explicit negative evidence does not facilitate language learning.Brown, R., & Hanlon, C. (1970). Derivational complexity and order of acquisition on child speech. In J. Hayes (Ed.), Cognition and the developmenf of language (pp. 11-53). New York: Wiley. Psychologist David McNeill argues that when parents correct children explicitly, the correction is unlikely to be helpful in learning grammar because it is a single correction that will most likely not be repeated, and therefore a child might not remember or even notice the correction. This is demonstrated in the following exchange between a parent and child, which McNeill recorded: > :Child: Nobody don't like me. :Mother: No, say, \\"nobody likes me.\\" :Child: > Nobody don't like me. :[This exchange is repeated several times] :Mother: > No, now listen carefully. Say, \\"Nobody likes me.\\" :Child: Oh! Nobody don't > likes me.McNeill, D. (1966) Developmental Psycholinguistics. in The Genesis > of Language, F. Smith and G. Miller (eds). MIT Press. As this conversation reveals, children are seemingly unable to detect differences between their ungrammatical sentences and the grammatical sentences that their parents produce. Therefore, children typically cannot use explicit negative evidence to learn that an aspect of grammar, such as using double negatives in English, is ungrammatical. This example also shows that children can make incorrect generalizations about which grammatical principle a parent corrects, suggesting that there must be something other than explicit feedback which drives children to arrive at a correct grammar.  Implicit direct negative evidence  In the input  Implicit direct negative evidence occurs when a parent responds to a child's ungrammatical utterance in a way that indicates that the utterance was not grammatical. This differs from explicit direct negative evidence because the parent merely implies that the child's utterance is ungrammatical, while explicit direct negative evidence involves a parent unambiguously telling a child that a sentence they produced is ungrammatical. There are several types of implicit direct negative evidence which parents utilize in responses to children's ungrammatical utterances. These forms include: repetitions, recasts, expansions, and requests for clarification. Repetitions occur when a parent repeats a child's utterance word for word, whereas recasts occur when a parent repeats a child's utterance while correcting the ungrammatical part of the sentence. Expansions are similar to recasts because they are potentially corrective utterances, but in expansions a parent also will lengthen the child's original utterance. Requests for clarification occur when a parent asks a question that can prompt a child to fix an ungrammatical sentence they previously said. Generally speaking, there is consensus that implicit direct negative evidence exists in the input, though there is debate about whether children can use implicit direct negative evidence to learn the grammar of their language. It is argued that parents frequently reformulate children's ungrammatical utterances.Saxton, Matthew. \\"Negative evidence and negative feedback: immediate effects on the grammaticality of child speech\\". First Language. 20 (60): 221‚Äì252. . Utility Some types of implicit direct negative evidence, such as reformulations, occur regularly in the input, thus making them potentially usable forms of evidence for language acquisition.Chouinard, Michelle M.; Clark, Eve V. (2003/08). \\"Adult reformulations of child errors as negative evidence\\". Journal of Child Language. 30 (3): 637‚Äì669. .Snow, C.E.; Ferguson, C. A., eds. (1977). Talking to Children: language input and acquisition. Cambridge Press. Some studies have demonstrated that parents respond differently when children utter grammatical or ungrammatical utterances, which suggests that children can use this parental feedback to learn grammar.Penner, Sharon (April 1987). \\"Parental Responses to Grammatical and Ungrammatical Child Utterances\\". Child Development. 58, Issue 2: 376‚Äì385. Some evidence also supports the hypothesis that children actually use implicit direct negative evidence in practice (see section below). Though there have been a number of studies that support the hypothesis that children can use implicit direct negative evidence that exists in the input, there have also been studies which stand in stark contrast to this hypothesis.Rhode, Douglas L.T.; Plaut, David C. (Spring 1999). \\"Language acquisition in the absence of explicit negative evidence: how important is starting small?\\" (PDF). Cognition. 72: 67‚Äì109 Linguists who do not believe that implicit direct negative evidence is helpful for a language learner argue that studies supporting the utility of implicit direct negative evidence do not properly specify which types of utterances qualify as recasts. They criticize the fact that some types of implicit direct negative evidence are not necessarily corrective (i.e. parental responses that may qualify as implicit direct negative evidence can occur after either grammatical or ungrammatical utterances). Additionally, some of these linguists question how children would know to only pay attention to certain kinds of recasts and not others. Furthermore, Gary Marcus argues that implicit direct negative evidence in the input is insufficient for children to learn the correct grammar of their language.Marcus, G. F. (January 1993). \\"Negative evidence in language acquisition\\". Cognition. 46 (1): 53‚Äì85. . He asserts that negative evidence does not explain why sentences are ungrammatical, thus making it difficult for children to learn why these sentences should be excluded from their grammar. He also argues that for children to be able to even use implicit direct negative evidence, they would need to receive negative feedback on a sentence 85 times in order to eliminate it from their vocabulary, but children do not repeat ungrammatical sentences nearly that often. Marcus also purports that implicit evidence is largely unavailable because the feedback differs from parent to parent, and is inconsistent in both the frequency with which it is offered and the kinds of errors it corrects. Other studies demonstrate that implicit negative evidence decreases over time, so that as children get older there is less feedback, making it less available and, consequentially, less likely to account for children's unlearning of grammatical errors. Hirsh- Pasek, K., Treiman, R., & Schneiderman, M. (1984). Brown and Hanlon revisited: Mothers‚Äô sensitivity to ungrammatical forms. Journal of Child Language, 11, 81-88. Usage Assuming that implicit direct negative evidence is usable, there are some studies which demonstrate that children do use implicit direct negative evidence to correct their grammatical mistakes. For example, experiments show that children produce a greater number of grammatical sentences when parents provide them with any type of immediate implicit direct negative evidence, including recasts. This evidence supports claims that direct negative evidence assists a child in their language learning. Chouinard also found that children are highly attentive to parental responses and that children respond to implicit correction in predictable ways. Children tend to directly respond to these reformulations by either affirming the reformulation or disagreeing with their parent if the parent misunderstood the child's intended meaning, revealing that children can discern when parental feedback is meant to correct their grammatical errors. Additionally, children have been shown to correct their initial errors when a parent recasts the child's morphological error.Farrar, Michael J. \\"Negative evidence and grammatical morpheme acquisition\\". Developmental Psychology. 28 (1): 90‚Äì98. However, other researchers have conducted studies that demonstrate that children do not need negative feedback in order to learn language.Bohannon, John N.; MacWhinney, Brian; Snow, Catherine. \\"No negative evidence revisited: Beyond learnability or who has to prove what to whom\\". Developmental Psychology. 26 (2): 221‚Äì226. . This is evidenced in a case study in which a mute child was tested to see whether he could comprehend a grammar even though he had received no corrective feedback (since corrective feedback occurs as a response to ungrammatical sentences that children produce). Though the child did not produce any speech and therefore did not receive any negative feedback, researchers found that he was able to learn grammatical rules. Although this study does not answer whether negative evidence can be helpful for learning language, it does suggest that direct negative evidence is not needed to learn grammar. Another study also demonstrates that implicit negative evidence is a negative predictor of the rate at which children eliminated ungrammatical utterances from their speech.Morgan, J. L., Bonamo, K. M., & Travis, L. L. (1995). Negative evidence on negative evidence. Developmental Psychology, 31(2), 180-197.  Direct negative evidence in language learning  Though there is no consensus regarding whether there is sufficient and usable implicit negative evidence in the input, if children are exposed to direct negative evidence, then they could use that evidence to validate hypotheses they have made about their grammar. On the other hand, if there is not sufficient usable negative evidence in the input, then there is a \\"no negative evidence\\" problem, which questions of how a language learner can learn language without negative evidence. This is a problem because if a child only hears grammatical sentences which are consistent with multiple grammars, then it would be impossible to determine which grammar is correct unless there was some other factor influencing what grammar a child ultimately hypothesizes to be correct. Proponents of linguistic nativism suggest that the answer to the \\"no negative evidence\\" problem is that language knowledge that cannot be learned is innate. They argue that the language input is not rich enough for children to develop a fully developed grammar from the input alone. This view is referred to as the poverty of the stimulus argument. The central idea of the poverty of the stimulus argument is that children could have multiple hypotheses about aspects of their grammar which are distinguishable only by negative evidence (or by hearing ungrammatical sentences and recognizing those sentences as ungrammatical). Supporters of the poverty of the stimulus argument assert that because the negative evidence that is needed to learn language by the input alone does not exist, children cannot learn certain aspects of grammar from the input alone, and therefore there must be some aspects of grammar which involve innate mechanisms.Lasnik, Howard; Lidz, Jeffrey L. (2016-12-22). The Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus. .Baker, C. L. (1979). \\"Syntactic Theory and the Projection Problem\\". Linguistic Inquiry. 10 (4): 533‚Äì581. .  Indirect negative evidence in language acquisition  Indirect negative evidence refers to using what's not in the input to make an inference about what's not possible. For example, when we see a dog bark, we are likely to think that dogs bark, not that every kind of animal barks. This is because we have never seen horses or fish or any other animal bark, so our hypothesis becomes that only dogs bark. We use this same inference to assume that the sun will rise tomorrow, having seen it rise every other day so far. No evidence received indicates that the sun may not rise once every two thousand years, or only rises on years that are not 2086, but since all evidence seen so far is consistent with the universal generalization, we infer that the sun does indeed rise every day. In language acquisition, indirect negative evidence may be used to constrain a child's grammar; if a child never hears a certain construction, the child concludes that it is ungrammatical. Utility of indirect negative evidence Indirect negative evidence and word learning Child and adult speakers rely on 'suspicious coincidences' when learning a new word meaning. When learning a new word meaning, children and adults use only the first few instances of hearing that word in order to decide what it means, rapidly constricting their hypothesis if only used in a narrow context. In an experiment conducted by Xu and Tenebaum, 4-year-old participants learning a novel word 'fep' readily decided that it referred only to Dalmatians if only hearing it while shown pictures of Dalmatians; although they received no information that 'fep' was unable to refer to other kinds of dogs, the suspicious coincidence that they had never heard it in other contexts caused them to restrict their meaning to just one breed.  Indirect negative evidence and syntax  Child language learners can use this same type of probabilistic inference to decide when and how verbs can be used. A word children hear often, like 'disappear', is more likely to be used than a less common word with a similar meaning, 'vanish'. Children studied said that the ungrammatical sentence \\"*We want to disappear our heads\\" was ungrammatical, but when given the same sentence with vanish, they were less sure of the grammaticality. Given the frequency of 'disappear' in intransitive clauses, learners could infer that if it were possible in transitive clauses, they would have heard it in those contexts. Thus, the high frequency of the intransitive verb use leads to the inference that the transitive verb use is impossible. This inference is less reliable with a less frequent verb like \\"vanish\\" because children have not heard enough instantiations of the verb to infer that it is never transitive. It has been argued that children use indirect negative evidence to make probabilistic inferences about the syntax of the language they are acquiring. A 2004 study by Regier & Gahl produced a computational model which provides support for this argument. They assert that children can use the absence of particular patterns in the input in order to conclude that such patterns are illicit. According to Regier and Gahl, young language learners form hypotheses about what is and isn't correct based on probabilistic inferences. As children are exposed to more and more examples of a certain phenomenon, their hypothesis space narrows. Notably, Regier and Gahl assert that this ability for probabilistic inference can be used in all sorts of general learning tasks, and not just linguistic ones. Regier and Gahl also present their model as evidence against an argument from the poverty of the stimulus, because their model illustrates that syntactic learning is possible from using the input alone, and does not necessarily require some innate linguistic knowledge of syntax. However, probabilistic inferences based on indirect negative evidence can lead children to make an incorrect hypothesis about their language, which leads to errors in early language production. In his variational model, Charles Yang notes that based on indirect negative evidence, English-acquiring children could conclude that English is a topic- drop language, such as Chinese. A topic-drop language allows the subject and object to be dropped in a sentence as long as they are in topic. English does not allow topic-drop, as evidenced by the insertion of expletive subjects in sentences such as There is rain. Yang notes that in English child-directed speech, children very rarely hear expletive subjects. Yang asserts that this leads English-acquiring children to momentarily conclude that English is a topic-drop language. His assertion is supported by the parallels between the topic-drop errors made by English-acquiring children and the licit topic-drop sentences produced by Chinese-speaking adults. Some researchers argue that indirect negative evidence is unnecessary for language acquisition. For example, Abend et al. built a Bayesian inference model that mimics a child's acquisition of English, using only data from a single child in the CHILDES corpus. They found that the model successfully learned English word order, mappings between word labels and semantic meanings of words (i.e. word learning), and used surrounding syntax to infer the meaning of novel words. They conclude that the success of this model shows that it is possible for children to acquire language on positive evidence alone, as the model did not make use of what was not in the input.

The first being a collection off gatherers, iron smelters, hunters and harvesters mainly autochthonous elements who bear the name Peki and occupied that forest grove located between two mountains ranges called Eyeto (sun mountain) and Akpato (fish mountain). This group forms and bears the name Peki and resided in caves and other fortresses within the area to be called Akwapim-Togo ranges. The ranges lying just about 80 miles North East of Accra and was accessed by few day's journey. The second group, in fact, most predominant segment of the population were Ewe migrants who claimed to have arrived from Glime or Notsie in present-day Togo. Their story was that they suffered under a wicked ruler called Agorkorli. These elements were on reconnaissance for their lost relations who deserted their fold when they migrated from Glime. The group formed part of the Gbe or Gbi segment of Ewe division. The lost elements were identified as the Gbeses of present-day Ga population in the capital city of Accra. The third group was mostly war survivors, fugitives, and renegade elements from other kingdoms like Akwamu, Akwapim, Asante, Dahomey, Kwahu and Denkyira. These elements introduced warfare, mercenary economy and brutality to the first and second groups who were mostly gatherers, iron smelters and farmers. These final elements organized the state to engage other adjacent states. Some of them worked to destabilize their home societies in brutal warfare in the 18th and 19th Centuries. Language The first autochthon elements speak a language today classified in Ghana as of Guan extract. Due to sparse numbers, friendly disposition and ability to learn, they learn fast the languages of the arriving migrants. Today, except for few words this language is extinct. The migrants who arrived with language of Kwara region of Adja Ewe quickly spread their dialect and was adopted by Peki. The third group arrived with languages of other Guan, Kyerepong and Ga extracts. There were also minority communities residing on top of Akwapim-Togo ranges who joined the population of Peki with several mix of languages. They sought refuge in the mountain ranges from other marauding tribes west of the Firao, or Amu also known as the Volta river . There were others with linguistic trait to the Akan dialect. These combinations merged to create a type of Ewe language unknown within the region. The name Krepi Krepi or Creppe is a Danish corruption of the actual name, Peki. Peki's political and military influence in the region resulted in the area referred to as Krepi by various European powers in the region. Communities There is always a contest about the communities that formed Peki. European explorers first classified all communities east of the Volta as Peki or Krepi/Krepe. This was later reduced to inland Ewe communities. The dominant role played by Peki over other Ewe and non-Ewe groups stretching into present day Togo however set Peki aside within the Volta until the first decade of the 20th Century. The following communities and towns signed formal treaties as part of the Peki State and recognized Kwadzo Dei the King of Krepi as their lord in 1880; Boso, Awudome, Anum, Betekwase (Peki Wudome), (Peki Avetile), Tsito, Toseng, Kpalime, Abutia, Tonkor, Sokodei, Dzake, Adzokoe, Tsame, Tsate, Afefieve, Ziavi, Kwanta, Tsibu, Agovi, Siripo, Saviefe, Dadome, Atsoi, Valeme, Nyangbo, Kpandu, Dzibi, Nkonya, Adaklu, Goekpe, Waya, Madse, Avatime, Tanyigbe, Have, Dzolo, Kpedze, Taviefe, Todzikofe, Kpetoe, Ziokpe, Nyetoi, Agotime, Buem, and Nkabi (Nkawkubio). By the beginning of the 20th Century and after annulment of Asante-Akwamu hegemony in the area, these satellite towns who first sought protection of Peki began to assert their independence. Peki was there reduced to Metropolitan Peki composed of Blengo (capital; and residence of Kwadzo Dei the king of Peki), Anum, Boso, Avetile, Dzake, Tsame, A∆íeviwo∆íe, Dzogbati, Seremase, Adzokoe, Anyirawase, Tsito, Ave≈ãui, Kwanta, Tsibu, Bame, Kpalime, ∆âo…ñi, Toseng,Tonkor, Tsate, Kayera, Nkwakubio, To and ∆≤egbe. Metropolitan Peki is now the only officially recognized Peki State presently with its administrative District Capital at Kpeve. European Influence Until the arrival of European on the Gold Coast, Kwadzo Dei the King of Peki administered the entire region. They kept close ties with their kith and kins; Gbeses at the Coast. From the Danish forts, Peki traded with the Europeans offering palm oil, kernel oil, ivory, hides, honey and cotton. Europeans brought fabrics, guns and gunpowder and drinks. Peki is located at the confluence of two major trading routes; Salaga to Christianborg Castle at Osu and Agou-Kpalime route to Fort Prinzenstein in Keta. The Pekis although not directly involved with trade taxed merchants plying these routes and also offered protection and security on the routes. Tax collected from merchants was invested in ammunitions and manufacturing of gunpowder essential commodities which Kwadzo Dei controlled within the region. Adequately armed, the state engaged in warfare against any rising state capable of been a threat to Peki. There were military engagements between Asante/Akwamu/Anlo forces against Peki in 1869-72. Danish traders who were operating at the coast sought protection of their wares from Peki and in turn rewarded Kwadzo Dei handsomely with sophisticated weaponry from Europe. In 1850, the Danes devised their interest in the Gold Coast to the British. Peki was specifically visited by Governors Winniet and Carstentein and the town was shown as one of the properties in exchange. After the transaction, the British were unable to impact Peki as the British did not have adequate resources. Kwadzo Dei thus remained an independent King for over thirty years until the scramble for Africa in mid-1885. By extension, Kwadzo Dei ruled over Krepi; areas deep into present day Togo singularly until the turn of the 20th century. Warfare In 1826, Peki led a contingent under Akoto of Akwamu in the Akatamanso/Katamanso battle of Dodowa; a battle that broke the back of Kumasi and erased Asante's invincibility within the region. In spite of constant battles, there were trade and cultural exchanges among all these societies. Wars are declared by rulers. When Peki was first visited by Danish traders at the close of the 17th Century, the society was seen as engaging in farming for most part of the year while spending the rest on mercenary warfare. The Norddeutsche Missionsgellshaft (The North German Mission Society) or The Bremen Mission Background This society established in the early part of the 19th Century was inspired by the Pietist Movement and the Christian Awakening which occurred in the 17thand 18th Centuries which were themselves outshoots of the Reformation which took place earlier in the 16th Century. Their objective was to send European missionaries to other lands to establish the Christian faith among other peoples. On 10 June 1835 at Stade, The German Protestants had an open meeting where it was mooted to form a single North German Missionary Society to send out men into the world to spread the Gospel. Missionary Work The Society had reasonable financial support and the General Meeting held in 1842 decided to open two mission fields in New Zealand and India. Later, West Africa was added and four young graduates from the Mission School; Lorenz Wolf of Bingen on the Rhine, 26 years old; Luer Bultman of Vahr near Bremen, 28 years old; James Graff of Jutland in Denmark, 32 years old; and Karl Flato of Horn near Bremen, 25 years old were sent to Africa to locate a suitable mission area, free from slave traders and where the climate was agreeable. By profession they were tradesmen: carpenters and leather and shoemakers. These men set out from Germany for their missionary endeavor on 17th, March 1847. The first point of call of the missionaries was Cape Coast the hub of European activities in the Gold Coast where they landed on 5 May 1847. The Wesleyan missionary at Cape Coast, Rev. Thomas Birch Freeman received them well. After two weeks, Bultman and Wolf left for Gabon to explore the possibility of opening a station there. Their adventure proved abortive. Bultman died soon after their arrival in Gabon. Catholic work started in earnest before they got there and the French authorities ordered them out to nip in the bud any form of rivalry between the Catholics and the Protestants. Wolf returned to Cape Coast disappointed and having lost a colleague and only to learn that Karl Flato too had died in his absence. The group was left with only Graff and Wolf who were dismayed about the turn of events but not discouraged. Their next move was to look for a mission field of their own choice. Accordingly, when Wolf and Graff learnt that since 1828 the Basel Mission had settled at Christianborg which was about 100 miles west of Cape Coast, they left Cape Coast for Christianborg. Arrival at Peki(Krepi)  Shortly before the arrival of the North German Missionaries to Christianborg, the Basel Missionaries had established a school at Osu near Accra. Attending that school was a Prince Nyangamagu, a son of Kwadzo Dei II, Tutu Yao, King of Krepi. When he heard that Wolf and Graff were searching for a place to start missionary work, Prince Nyangamagu assured them that his father, Kwadzo Dei II, a powerful King who ‚Äòruled over hundred of places‚Äô would welcome them. He invited them to go with him to Peki. The Missionaries consented and the prince sent words home. He received a positive response. The King sent bearers (carriers) to Christianborg to bring the missionaries to Peki. Wolf set out on 9 November 1847, leaving Graff behind. Wolf's Missionary diary clearly gave us a picture into the events and scenes he beheld on the journey. November 13, 1847, Abutia, now we observed that we had reached Krepi country. We concluded this from the fertility of the land and from the cleanliness and diligence of the natives. November 14, 1847, in the morning at Anum. Thousands were assembled in the market place and welcomed me with music and shouts of joy. The Chief and his elders wanted to speak with us but as I was in hurry, I asked them to meet me later at Peki. First day at Peki: Tutu, when being informed of my arrival had ordered all people who were free from work to change the path leading from Anum to Peki about half an hour‚Äôs walk into a broad road so that I might walk in comfort. When I was not far from Peki, the King‚Äôs son whom I had seen at Accra with some of the confidants of the King met me on the way and said he had sent them to lead me home. I shook hand with him and greeted him. My reception and the welcome accorded to me by the people and the King at Peki was too glorious for a poor missionary. The town consisted of three places. When I passed the first one (Dzake) it was the most beautiful African village I had ever seen, clean houses and a line of trees on both sides of the broad street ‚Äì people shouted with joy and accompanied me by the hundreds. The same happened at the second place (Avetile). The people went with me to the house of the King's son at Blengo where I was to lodge. I hardly sat down when two volleys of gun-fire greeted me. It was said Tutu had done this in order to honour me. After Rev Wolf's arrival in Peki, the German missionaries later moved further into Eweland to propagate the gospel. An important outpost for them was Keta where the mission work grew and expanded into the rest of Eweland.

The statue depicts Forrest shooting behind himself and is flanked by Confederate battle flags. It is generally considered aesthetically unappealing due to its abnormal facial features, which bear little resemblance to Forrest himself, and more resemble a screaming deformed man. Design The monument was designed by Jack Kershaw, a Vanderbilt University alumnus, co-founder of the League of the South, a white nationalist and white supremacist organization, and a former lawyer to James Earl Ray, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's killer. In the face of public criticism of the installation, Kershaw defended the statue by saying, \\"Somebody needs to say a good word for slavery.\\" Statue owner and friend of Kershaw, Bill Dorris told NPR in 2011 \\"As an artist, mediocre. As a thinker, he (Kershaw) was way ahead of a lot of people in his time.\\" Dorris described the process of sculpting Forrest: \\"Jack got some materials that I use to make bathtubs with. And he started with a butcher knife. That's the end result that you see out there right now.\\" Kershaw told an interviewer that his Forrest is crying: \\"Follow me!\\" The horse is covered in gold leaf, while Forrest is covered in silver leaf. At 25 feet tall, they are twice life size and the rider is \\"perfectly balanced\\". Forrest holds a gun, pointed behind him, in his left hand, and a sword in the right hand.Court Carney (August 2001). \\"The Contested Image of Nathan Bedford Forrest\\". The Journal of Southern History. 67 (3): 601‚Äì630. doi:10.2307/3070019. JSTOR 3070019 Location and dedication It was installed in 1998 surrounded by 13 Confederate Battle Flags and 13 flag poles flying various other Confederate or state flags on of land privately owned by Nashville businessman Bill Dorris. The property at 701D Hogan Rd is long and narrow, with Interstate 65 on one side and railway tracks on the other. The monument is visible from the interstate by the northbound shoulder near mile marker 77 south of downtown Nashville. Around the time the statue was installed, the state cleared vegetation to make it more visible from the Interstate, primarily due to the efforts of then-State Senator Douglas Henry (D-Nashville). The statue has been controversial since before it was installed. The statue was dedicated on July 11, 1998 by the Joseph E. Johnston Camp of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, who invited \\"40 other SCV camps, the United Daughters of the Confederacy and 10 re-enactment groups in period dress.\\" The SCV camp calls it one of its most ambitious projects they have done and notes the additional sponsorship of The Southern League and the Mary Noel Kershaw Foundation. In total, the dedication ceremony was attended by approximately 400 people, including Alberta Martin, who was once believed to be the last surviving widow of a Confederate soldier. Efforts to hide or remove The statue has been shot at more than once, vandalized regularly over the years, and more recently defaced with Black Lives Matter slogans, but always repaired. Protestors once tried to pull it down by tying it to a train. It is protected by a padlocked gate. In July 2015 the Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County sought permission to plant landscape screening in front of the monument to obscure its view from the interstate, but the request was denied by the Tennessee Department of Transportation. The statue was criticized by then-councilwoman and former mayor Megan Barry in the wake of the 2015 Charleston church shooting, as \\"an offensive display of hatred that should not be a symbol for a progressive and welcoming city such as Nashville.\\" Then-governor Bill Haslam said \\"It's not a statue that I like and that most Tennesseans are proud of in any way,\\" in 2015. On August 15, 2017 the mayor of nearby Oak Hill, Heidi Campbell, wrote an open letter to Governor Haslam urging the statue be obscured with landscaping. Reactions Shortly after the unveiling in 1998, BlueShoe Nashville noted that newspaper coverage showed that support for and dismay against the statue generally followed racial lines. It also critiqued the statue's quality, remarking that \\"Anyone seeing the crazed, pop-eyed look on the statue's face might wonder if the memorial is a homage, or a savage put-down.\\" In 2006, local blogger Brent K. Moore wrote that Forrest \\"has an expression that one makes after sitting on a thumb tack.\\" In 2015, The Washington Post called it \\"the weirdest Confederate statue in existence\\" and found the statue to have \\"a cartoonish and inadvertently satirical tone, incorporating elements of fiberglass and foil- candy wrapper coloring\\". The Post called the horse a \\"golden steed that looks like it was ripped from a merry-go-round for giants.\\" In June 2015 Gawker described the \\"alarming\\" statue as being created by a \\"fierce racist... for another bad man. The statue is so hilariously stupid that we should keep it forever\\" for it \\"perfectly honors the Confederacy.\\" A November 2015 Vibe.com article entitled 7 Controversial & Offensive Tourist Attractions In The U.S. described the installation as the \\"ugliest\\" statue of Forrest and noted it is \\"surrounded by an overwhelmingly large display of numerous Confederate flags\\" Rachel Maddow on MSNBC described it as having \\"terrifying marble blue eyes\\" and a \\"mouth like a circular saw\\". Comedian Stephen Colbert first quoted President Trump's tweets about \\"preserving the beautiful monuments\\" in the wake of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia then immediately mocked this statue by saying \\"apparently the Confederacy was founded by skirt-wearing nutcrackers riding wet lizards\\" and by mimicking the pose, shooting invisible soldiers following Forrest and riding an imaginary horse around the stage. Similarly, comedian John Oliver referred to the statue as being \\"objectively terrifying regardless of context\\", describing the statue's face as looking \\"like if a nickel did cocaine\\". In 2017 Slate called the statue the \\"Confederacy's Dumbest Monument.\\" Atlas Obscura called it \\"One Confederate statue that accurately reflects the ugliness of its subject.\\" In an article titled The 10 Most Terrifying Public Statues Artnet news wrote the \\"statue (is) alarmingly racist, to say that it is also poorly done is a gross understatement\\"news.artnet.com/art-world/10-terrifying-public-statues-recent- memory-311265/amp-page while Shareart led The 10 Most Bizarre Public Sculptures with this effort. Salon described the statue as something \\"fashioned by someone who's had a human described to him but has never actually seen one in real life.\\" The Independent went with a simple \\"stupid, racist statue\\" and called for its removal. Canada's National Post called the monument a \\"towering eyesore\\" and described it as \\"one of the most vile Confederate monuments in the great state of Tennessee.\\" In late December 2017, the statue was vandalized with pink paint. Bill Dorris The owner of the statue and the land it sits on, Bill Dorris, is a Nashville lawyer and businessman. He has regularly given media interviews defending his right to display the Forrest statue and his flags. Although Dorris denies being a racist, he calls slavery a form of \\"social security\\" for African Americans. Dorris states that he has \\"turned down requests from the KKK to hold rallies\\" at the site. Dorris also argued that removing the statue would be detrimental to Nashville's tourism industry, and compared it to historic plantations in the Nashville area like the Travellers Rest, The Hermitage, and the Belle Meade Plantation. When the Metro Region suggested adding vegetation, Dorris told WPLN that \\"I've got some 1,800-foot flagpoles. I could put them up starting tomorrow. They're going to have to build a helluva wall and a helluva bunch of trees to block all that.\\" Dorris told Canada's National Post paper that he believes that the people against Confederate monuments in New Orleans are \\"cane blacks,\\" who were probably \\"illegals to start with,\\" in regards to controversies over Confederate monuments in that city. Dorris also said in that interview \\"Slavery was never an issue. Nathan Bedford Forrest was not a racist\\" and again called slavery a form of \\"social security\\" for African Americans, \\"a cradle-to-the-grave proposition.\\" See also *List of Confederate monuments and memorials *Nathan Bedford Forrest *Nathan Bedford Forrest Monument *Nathan Bedford Forrest Bust References 1998 sculptures 1998 establishments in Tennessee Buildings and structures in Nashville, Tennessee Confederate States of America monuments and memorials in Tennessee Equestrian statues in Tennessee Nathan Bedford Forrest Outdoor sculptures in Tennessee Vandalized works of art in the United States Monuments and memorials in Tennessee ","title":"Nathan Bedford Forrest Statue"},{"id":"55145206","text":"Ebrahim, also known as Chit Lwin, is a Rohingya lawyer, accountant and former politician.

His academic studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. He served in the Royal Navy from 1941 to 1945, although he suffered from sea-sickness. Initially serving as a mine-sweeper in the British home waters, he later took part in both the Allied invasion of Sicily and the Normandy landings. Academic career After the end of the war, Dodwell returned to Cambridge to complete his studies under Philip Grierson. He specialized in medieval art history, particularly in illuminated manuscripts. In 1949, he was made a senior research fellow of the Warburg Institute, which had been relocated a few years earlier from Hamburg to London. In 1953, he was chosen by Archbishop Geoffrey Fisher for the prestigious position of librarian-archivist of Lambeth Palace Library, despite having no formal qualifications as a librarian. In this position, Dodwell assisted with the careful transfer of the contents of the library (heavily damaged during the war) to proper repositories. In 1958, he became a lecturer and librarian at Trinity College, Cambridge, and in 1966 he obtained a professorship at Manchester University. He held this position for 23 years.

In Sri Lanka, it airs on TV Derana, dubbed into Sinhala and titled as Pruthivi Maharaja.It is dubbed into Tamil and titled as Kadhal Mannan Prithvi and it airs on Sun Life from 5 August 2019. The show follows the stories of the prince of Malwa, Prithvi Vallabh and the princess of Manyakhet, Mrinalvati and how their never- supposed-to-be love story unfolds.  Plot  Mrinalvati (Mrinal) is the Princess of the Manyakhet Kingdom and her younger brother Tailap is the King of Manyakhet, who are advised by Guru Vinayaditya. Due to the treachery of King Singhdant of the Malwa Kingdom, which killed the entire royal family except Mrinal and Tailap, Mrinal has dedicated her life to getting revenge against Singhdant. She sends some African mercenaries to attack Malwa, but they are stopped by Prithvi Vallabh(Munj), the adopted son of Singhdant and the Yuvraj of Malwa. After a successful alliance with the King of Devgiri, Bhilam, Mrinal decides to secretly attack Malwa with foreign explosives and also kill Singhdant during the anticipated Rang-Utsav of Malwa. There she meets Prithvi, who immediately falls in love with her and uses him to get to Singhdant. Their plan is successful, but she is not able to kill Singhdant. Prithvi follows Mrinal and throws his sword at her, but she escapes. There is huge loss of life and property in Malwa and because of this, Prithvi is banished from the Kingdom. He goes to the place where Singhdant had found him in order to know the truth about his birth. An old lady informs Prithvi that she had found him in the forest and when she shouted whose child that was, the legendary Gajakesari appeared. Meanwhile, Tailap is in love with a courtesan named Kosha, because of which, his wife, the Queen of Manyakhet, Jakkala gets very jealous. Mrinal fixes the marriage of Bhilam-Raj's daughter, Vilas with Tailap's son, Prince Satyashray. Mrinal asks Tailap to attack Malwa as it is in a weak state. In the battle, the son of Singhant, Yuvraj Sindhuraj is about to lose against Tailap, but the Commander of Malwa, Kallari, and Prithvi come to his aid. Malwa wins the battle. War prisoner Tailap is released by Prithvi, whom Singhdant has made the new King of Malwa. Mrinal is unable to bear this humiliation and goes to Africa and hires a very strong army including giants. Meanwhile, Prithvi invites Sindhu's son, Prince Bhoj back from his Gurukul in order to participate in the next battle. The battle starts as Mrinal refuses to accept peace. Prithvi and his men are successful in killing all the giants and major part of Manyakhet's army during the night. The next day, Prithvi and Mrinal engage in a duel in which Prithvi beats Mrinal and takes her as Malwa's hostage. In Malwa, Mrinal again tries to kill Singhdant, but is unsuccessful. Mahakay and Sindhu, along with Mulraj, plot to have Mrinal kidnapped when she would be taken to the prison. Prithvi decides to do something in order to change Mrinal's heart. Thus, he kidnaps her with the assistance of Daku Dharti Singh. During the kidnapping, Prithvi cuts Mulraj's hand. News reach Mahakay and he asks Mulraj to kill Mrinal and put the blame on Prithvi, but Mrinal and Prithvi both escape successfully. They again meet that old lady who gives them shelter in the forest where Prithvi saves Mrinal from a snake. By looking at his bravery and kindness, Mrinal falls in love with Prithvi. Prithvi believing Mrinal, takes her to princess Amrusha and thereafter a new friendship between Amrusha and Mrinal begins. Leaving Mrinal to Amrusha, Prithvi sets out to Malwa to convey the good news to his father. On his way, he comes to know that Kalari had been captured and sets out to free him. Mrinal, on the other hand, reveals to Sulochana that it was all her plan to kill Singhdant by trapping Prithvi. Meanwhile, Sindhu, led astray by Mahakay, decides to invite Mrinal to Malwa in Prithvi's absence and succeeds in his mission. The same night, he kills Singhdant and blames Mrinal for the same. Rajmata Vatra, believing the same, orders to arrest both Prithvi and Mrinal, after which both are imprisoned. During the funeral for Singhdant, Sindhuraj is made the next king of Malwa after which he insults Mrinal and sentences her to death. When Sindhu is about to light the funeral pyre, Rajmata asks him to stop and asks Prithvi to do the same. Later she reveals the actual truth of Singhdant's murder, shocking everyone. Prithvi gets his post back and saves Mrinal from execution and takes her to Malwa as she falls unconscious. Tailap, on the other hand, knowing about his sister's state sets out to free her with the help of the neighbouring kingdoms. Later, Prithvi forgives Sindhu and refuses to punish him for his crime. Tailap reaches Malwa where he is welcomed by Prithvi to his surprise with the proposal of peace and friendship and takes him to Mrinal. She wakes up recalling the insult to her and refuses to accept Prithvi's proposal of peace and, in anger, slaps Prithvi. As she is about to leave, Amrusha intervenes and try to persuade Mrinal, but in vain. Meanwhile, Prince Satyashraya returns from his Gurukul and is introduced to his would-be wife Vilas, after which he tortures her emotionally. Back at Malwa, Sindhu tries to kill himself, but is saved by Prithvi after which everyone forgives him. Mrinal, on the other undergoes emotional trauma thinking about Sindhu's insulting words, but is comforted by Guru Aditya. After this, Prithvi goes to meet Van Amma to learn the secret of his birth and identity who advises him to go to Mrinal to know the truth of Gajakesari. Everyone refuses to let Prithvi go to Manyaket, but he is stubborn and so left with no other option, Rajmata tells that she would let Prithvi go if Kalari gives permission. Kalari challenges Prithvi to a duel if he wants his permission. Satyashraya tortures Vilas again, but this time is caught by Sulochana who promises Vilas that she would not reveal the truth to Mrinal until she wishes to. The very next day, he tries to misbehave with Vilas for which he is brutally punished by Mrinal and is made to apologise to Vilas and her family. Prithvi defeats Kalari in the duel and sets off to Manyakhet and is accompanied by Bhoj and Rasiniti. Back in Manyakhet, Vikramjeet, the brother of Bhilam Raj, makes his entry. Prithvi, on reaching Manyakhet, proposes marriage to Mrinal, shocking everyone and is insulted by Mrinal again. After this incident, Prithvi stays in Manyaket. It is then that Bhoj meets Vilas, who had actually come to meet Prithvi, and is instantly drawn to her. That very day, Mrinal comes to meet Prithvi in his tent and puts forward the condition of beheading his family members in exchange for her marriage with him. Prithvi, undeterred by her words, asks her permission to stay until Diwali to which she agrees and also invites him for dinner at the palace.

Early life and education  Jessup, a native of Washington, D.C., was of African-American, Native American, and European descent. Her father, Joseph Mills, was a member of the Pamunkey tribe; her mother was Margaret Hall Mills, a hairdresser who had dreamed of a career in the theater. The thirteenth of eighteen children, she was one of twenty-nine members of her family who followed an artistic profession. After an early display of artistic talent she was apprenticed to Herman L. Walker; two of her paintings were shown at the 1939 World's Fair, when she was just 13 years old. Jessup was a 1943 graduate of Dunbar High School. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Howard University, where she studied with Lo√Øs Mailou Jones, in 1959, following that with a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Catholic University of America in 1969. Career Jessup spent thirteen years teaching art in the public schools of Washington, D.C., eventually becoming supervisor of art education for the system. She also taught at the prominent private school Sidwell Friends. She founded \\"The World is Your Museum\\", forerunner of the Capital Children's Museum, and was the first artist-in-residence at the Smithsonian Institution's Anacostia Community Museum. In 1979, Jessup's work appeared alongside the work of her two daughters and one son-in-law in an exhibit called \\"Family Re-Union\\" at the Market 5 Gallery in Washington, D.C. A Washington Post journalist who covered the exhibit's opening described Jessup's paintings as showing \\"her maternal fear at her sons' bad experiences with managers and her frustration at the displacement of the poor.\\" Jessup spoke to the journalist about the difficulty Black artists had in getting recognition for their work at the time: \\"I had shows at two Georgetown galleries in the 1960s, then have been represented in juried shows, but for the mainstream galleries it's been mainly tokenism in a few group shows.\\" By the time of her death, Jessup's work had been exhibited at places including the juried Irene Leache Memorial Biennial Art Show, the Castelli Gallery in New York City, the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History, Catholic University, and other museums and universities. The Maryland Women's Hall of Fame honored her in 2016 for her \\"outstanding contributions and leadership in the Arts.\\" Jessup's 1967 painting Rainy Night, Downtown is in the collection of the National Museum of Women in the Arts. The view in the painting was inspired by the view Jessup had from her car window as she sat at the intersection of H and 14th Streets NW in D.C. The painting is \\"a universal experience of the pulsating life of a large city at night,\\" according to M. Therese Southgate. Other works are in the Anacostia Community Museum and in private collections. She also received awards from organizations including the Research Club of Washington, D.C.; the Urban League; and the American Red Cross. Personal life Jessup had two sons and two daughters, all of whom became involved in the arts. Daughter Rose Powhatan is a mixed- media artist who founded and directs the Powhatan Museum of Indigenous Arts and Culture. Her other daughter, Marsha Jessup, is a medical illustrator. Sons Juaquin Jessup (who played for two years with the funk band Mandrill) and Miklos Jessup are both musicians. Her nephew David Mills was a journalist and Emmy Award-winning television writer. She died at home in Columbia, Maryland, on December 24, 2016, at the age of 90. She was survived by her four children, five grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.

The stele is attributed to ‚ÄúThe Dexileos Sculptor‚Äù. Its creation can be dated to 394 BC, based on the inscription on its bottom, which provides the dates of birth and death of Dexileos. The stele is made out of an expensive variety of Pentelic marble and is tall. It includes a high relief sculpture depicting a battle scene with an inscription below it. The stele was discovered in 1863 AD in the family plot of Dexileos at the Dipylon cemetery in Kerameikos, Athens. It was found in situ, but was moved during World War II and is now on display in the Kerameikos Museum in Athens. Description The stele is carved in high relief and depicts a cavalryman, Dexileos, mounted on a horse, charging a Spartan enemy, probably at the 394 BC Battle of Nemea during the Corinthian War. Dexileos is seen in his youthfulness, shown through the lack of a beard being present. He wears a chiton, chlamys, and petasos as well as krepides on his feet. His garments flow in the wind as his horse rears upwards. Dexileos has one arm up, in position to hold a spear, which has since been lost from the sculpture as it was an attachment of a different material. His torso twist forward in the frontal position while his head is in ¬æ position, slanted with his gaze down towards his foe. The spear, reins, and petasos, which is a wide brimmed hat usually worn by Athenian ephebe, are all missing from the stele. Remnants of their presence are marked by stains and dowel holes in the relief where they would have been attached. Below the horse is Dexileos‚Äôs enemy, who has fallen in battle and is shielding himself from the equine with one arm covering his head. The greek enemy is seen in the frontal position with his head up towards Dexileos. The enemy is also depicted completely nude, representing his vulnerability as well as his worthiness as an opponent. The inscription below the relief says: This not only gives an exact date of Dexileos‚Äôs lifespan but also describes his death in battle at Corinth. The entire stele relief scene is bordered on top with a pediment adorned with acroteria, which gives it a religious aspect with reference to naiskos, a small temple in the classical order. Dexileos Stele with inscription (drawing) Context The Dexileos stele reflects Athens during a time of chaos and disorder. Following the Athenian loss of the Peloponnesian War, Athenian democracy was finally restored after the ruling of Thirty Tyrants. Athens was also facing a war with Sparta at this time, the Corinthian War. Dexileos was a young cavalryman who died at the age of 20, which can be seen through the inscription that reveals his lifespan. Dexileos would have been an ephebe, going through his rite of passage to become a full, democratic citizen, like other Athenian men. This process included serving in the military for three years. This stele shares characteristics of two distinct ideologies in the classical period relating to death in battle; One being a very individualistic depiction glorifying the deceased and the other being an inclusion of aristocracy within Athenian democracy and depicting death as a sacrifice for the state. While this monument depicts wealthy Dexileos in triumph, bringing pride to his family, it also shows how he is part of the Athenian community, making a sacrifice of life for his people. Location Copy of the stele in the Dipylon Cemetery, the original now being in the Kerameikos Museum. The Dexileos Stele is one of three monuments honoring an Athenian warrior in the Dipylon cemetery. One other monument, the Polyandron, honors all those soldiers who died for the city within a certain year, including the death of Dexileos. All these soldiers remains, including those of the elite cavalry status as well as less wealthy foot soldiers, were mixed together, burned, and placed in the Demosion Sema for burial. This ritual equated all Athenians after death to create a complete, whole democracy. The other monument honored all fallen cavalrymen, listing eleven including Dexileos in total. This monument preserved the sacrifices of those cavalrymen to democracy. Funerary crown Funerary crown with the name of Dexileos on the base. 394/3 BC. Athens National Archaeological Museum, Nb.754 Another monument was discovered, dedicated to five Athenian cavalrymen including Dexileos. Only the crown of the public funerary monument remains, now in Athens National Archaeological Museum. The monument, in pentelic marble, was found west of Athens, in the area of the Demosion Sema. According to the inscription on the epistyle, the monument was erected in honour of the Athenian riders who fell in the Battle of Corinth (394) and the Battle of Coronea (394 BC). The list of the fallen includes the name of Dexileos, the young man who was also commemorated by means of a private relief stele that came to light in the ancient cemetery of the Kerameikos.

For the statue in Memphis, see Nathan Bedford Forrest Monument. The Nathan Bedford Forrest Bust is a bust of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest that is displayed in the Tennessee State Capitol in Nashville, Tennessee, U.S. History Tennessee Senate and Sons of Confederate Veterans member Douglas Henry, a Democrat representing the 21st Senate District in Davidson County, first proposed a resolution in the Tennessee General Assembly calling for a bust of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest to be installed within the state capitol, which passed on April 13, 1973. Forrest has been considered by many to be an iconic Southern hero of the American Civil War because of his reported military exploits, including his saving \\"Rome (Georgia) from a raid by Union military.‚Äù McKenney, Frank M., The Standing Army: History of Georgia‚Äôs County Confederate Monuments, WH Wolfe Associates, Alpharetta, Georgia, 1993, p. 133 Presently, Forrest is perhaps better known for his infamous antebellum career selling people into slavery, financing the Confederate troops under his command during the Civil War from his vast wealth made off the slave trade, commanding his Confederate troops during the Massacre at Fort Pillow, and his eventual role as the Grand Wizard of the first era Ku Klux Klan during the Reconstruction era of United States history. Fundraising for the bust was from the sale of 24\\" x 30\\" reproductions of a Forrest portrait at the Travellers Rest, a historic plantation in the Nashville area. The portrait by Joy Garner had been commissioned in 1973 for Travellers Rest by the Joseph E. Johnston camp of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. The bust was eventulally designed by Loura Jane Herndon Baxendale, whose husband Albert Hatcher Baxendale, Jr., was a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. The Nathan Bedford Forrest bust was cast by the Karkadoulias Bronze Art Foundry in Cincinnati and installed in the Tennessee State Capitol on November 5, 1978. Protests On the day of the bust's dedication, numerous African Americans protested at the capitol. More protests were organized by Black Tennesseans for Action in February 1979 after they were unsuccessful in gaining a meeting with Governor Lamar Alexander to discuss the issue. That month, the bust was \\"damaged after someone struck it in the head with a blunt object\\". Soon after, two crosses were burned in Nashville, a symbolic intimidation associated with the historic Ku Klux Klan; one of the crosses was burned outside the NAACP headquarters. In October 1980, \\"Tex Moore, grand dragon of the Tennessee chapter of the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, and others held a news conference in front of the bust.\\" In the wake of the 2015 Charleston church shooting, in which nine African Americans were murdered by a young white supremacist, Democratic Congressman Jim Cooper and state Representative Craig Fitzhugh suggested Forrest's bust should be removed from the Tennessee capitol. Republican Governor Bill Haslam and Senator Bob Corker also agreed. However, its removal was postponed. After the violence of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Governor Bill Haslam explicitly called for removal of the bust from the capitol, while Senator Corker suggested it should be moved to the Tennessee State Museum. But the Capitol Commission oversees elements of maintaining the complex. Composed of Secretary of State Tre Hargett, State Treasurer David Lillard, and Comptroller Justin P. Wilson, the Commission voted to reject the removal. Governor Haslam said that he was \\"very disappointed\\" with this decision. In December 2017 a legislative bill was proposed to relocate the bust to the Tennessee State Museum. In January 2019 the members of the State Capitol Commission turned down a request to remove the bust by a 7 to 5 vote. At the end of January, 2019 a group of Tennessee college students arrived at the Tennessee State capitol to request of newly elected Governor Bill Lee that the bust be removed. State troopers did not allow the students to see the governor because they did not have an appointment, but they did manage to meet with a representative from his office. On June 9, 2020, the Tennessee General Assembly debated HJR 0686 to remove the bust. Republican support for it to remain led to the motion failing in the House by five votes to eleven. Removal from Capitol On July 9, 2020, the Tennessee Capitol Commission voted 9-2 in favor of removing the bust from the Capitol building and relocating it to the Tennessee State Museum. The process to remove the bust is lengthy, and removal will likely not take place until 2021.

A heavy hooked sword or sickle-shaped sword, chilambu (anklet), and aramani (huge and heavy waist belt studded with bells) are a part of the ensemble. Often, as their identity, a Velichapadu grows long hair, which hangs loose on their forehead and back.  Performance  The Velichappadu makes their customary appearance in the temple after performing a puja. Here they perform a frantic dance called thullal, usually accompanied by beatings of drums and cymbals, and gets into a trance with the spirit of the presiding deity. The deity is believed to speak through him as the Velichappadu dances, delivering the frenzied forecasts. They may also predict solutions to problems put forward by devotees and hence the name which also translates as \\"the one who sheds light (on problems)\\". Their counsel, often delivered in incomprehensible words and abrupt gestures, is translated to the devotees by an assistant.

History Hong Kong and Macau are located at the east and the west sides of the Pearl River Delta respectively, with a close distance of about 64 kilometres in between. Hong Kong and Macau bilateral relations could be traced back to the Middle Neolithic. Both Hong Kong and Macau were under the influence of the same type of Neolithic culture. Tools and ornaments used by both places show tight relationship in idea and trade between the two. Hong Kong became the first European colony in East Asia for being occupied by the Portuguese Empire as Tam√£o in the early 16th Century. The Portuguese were defeated by the Ming Empire in Hong Kong in 1521, and eventually took Macau as their settlement at the Pearl River Estuary as a replacement. Macau had stood long as the most important European entrepot in East Asia since the 17th Century. Only until Hong Kong fell into the British hands in the early 1840s, Macau faced regional competition from a more opened and free British Colony. Since then, Hong Kong and Macau competed and cooperated for being the commercial centres in the Pearl River Estuary. Eventually Hong Kong developed as one of the busiest entrepots and financial centres while Macau became a world gambling capital.

The protein is predominately expressed in respiratory epithelium and the first notion of its clinical implications was from the discovery that genetic variation of CDHR3 is strongly associated to early severe asthma exacerbations in children. Subsequent studies have suggested that CDHR3 is a receptor for a subtype of rhinovirus.  Function and cellular location  The exact physiological role of CDHR3 is not known, but as the CDHR3 protein is expressed in epithelial tissues and has six extracellular cadherin domains plus a short transmembrane segment, it is believed to be related to the function of similar cadherins which function in cell adhesion and cell-to-cell signaling. Two single-cell RNA expression studies furthermore found CDHR3 to be highly selectively expressed in ciliated epithelial cells, compared to other cell types in the respiratory epithelium, and thereby to be a marker for ciliated cells in respiratory airway tissue.  Clinical significance  A nonsynonymous mutation in CDHR3 at rs6967330 (C529Y) was at first found to be associated with severe asthma exacerbations in early childhood, with genome- wide significance. Functional experiments further indicated that this gene polymorphism leads to increased surface expression of the CDHR3 protein. A subsequent study found that CDHR3 is a probable receptor for rhinovirus type C, a common form of rhinovirus. Recent studies furthermore found that CDHR3 gene variation is not associated with childhood bronchiolitis from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, which resemble early asthma exacerbations as a phenotype. However, childhood bronchiolitis not caused by RSV infection, of which rhinovirus is often implicated, was associated with the CDHR3 gene variation. This is line with the results from a study on chronic rhinosinusitis, which often is associated rhinovirus infection, where CDHR3 gene variation also was found to be a strong risk factor. Therefore, CDHR3 seems to causally linked to increased propensity for rhinovirus C infection.

Education and early life  Frederick Brundrett was born in Sunny Bank, Ebbw Vale, Monmouthshire on 25 November 1894, the oldest child of the seven sons and three daughters of Walter Brundrett, an accountant who worked for the Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron and Coal Company, and his wife Ada Richardson. He was educated at Rossall School, a public school in Fleetwood, Lancashire, where he excelled at sports. Later in life he was said to be the one of the country's oldest first-class field hockey players. Although the school was not renowned for mathematics, Brundrett won a mathematical scholarship to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, which he entered in 1913. He earned first class honours in the first part of the Mathematical Tripos in 1914 and became a wrangler in 1916. Career Brundrett joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve to participate in World War I. He was slated for duty on patrol boats but came down with a case of mumps and was held in isolation. It was discovered that he was a wrangler and he was reassigned to the Wireless Experimental Department at , where he spent the rest of the war. Demobilised in 1919, Brundrett, joined the scientific staff of the Royal Naval Signal School. In 1920 he married Enid James; they had one child, a son they called James Edward. Brundrett remained at the Royal Naval Signal School until 1937, when he was transferred to the headquarters of the Royal Naval Scientific Service in London as Principal Scientific Officer in the Department of Scientific Research and Experiment (DSRE). He became the superintending scientist in 1940, assistant director in 1941 and deputy director in 1943. He created a system for categorising scientists, made arrangements with the Treasury for them to be directly appointed to civil service positions and obtained quick security clearances for them. He recruited some ten thousand scientists for the war effort to work for the Admiralty, the War Office, the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Supply. His son James, a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, was killed in Italy on 30 September 1944. For his wartime work, Brundrett was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1946 New Year Honours. When Sir Charles Wright retired in 1947, Brundrett succeeded him as the Chief of the Royal Naval Scientific Service. He chose William Cook as his Director of Physical Research. The year 1947 also saw the formation of the Defence Research Policy Committee (DRPC) to advise the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff on matters of scientific policy, of which Brundrett became an ex officio member. The DRPC was initially chaired by the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence, Sir Henry Tizard. Brundrett became deputy chairman in 1950 and in 1954 he became the chairman when he succeeded Sir John Cockcroft as Chief Scientific Adviser.

She was awarded a MBE for services to the charity sector in December 2015. She was made a Honorary Fellow of the University of Suffolk in October 2018. Career After a successful media and communications career in the United Kingdom, Long went to America and became a global entrepreneur as the first non-US citizen to be awarded the licensees for the National Football League, Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association, along with 70 collegiate licenses. With her company Unique Event Products, she created and sold what became some of the most successful sporting novelty products. Upon returning to England, Long recognised a gap in the UK advertising market - and identified that roundabouts, placed strategically throughout the UK, were the perfect platform for shouting at motorists. She founded Marketing Force, now the UK's market leader in roundabout sponsorship. She then became the Head of Communications at Hutchison Whampoa Ltd, working with the Executive Team, and leading Marketing and Communications for Hutchison Westports and their ports globally, progressing to Head of Communications at BT Exact, working with the CEO and Executive Board. Long then created a mobile phone content business called Celebrity Hot Pics, which became a global enterprise. Alongside her career, Long has devoted over 40 years as a voluntary charity campaigner and fundraiser. She regularly writes columns and articles, interviewing and championing successful businesses, individuals, celebrities and entrepreneurs as well as highlighting national and regional charity fundraising achievements and events. Charity work Gina Long MBE Long was awarded a MBE for services to the charity sector in December 2015. Long has raised over ¬£5 million for charity and started her own charitable foundation in December 2015 to support East Anglian families living with cancer or a disability. The GeeWizz Charitable Trust was set up to create a platform to purchase much-needed equipment for children in Suffolk and Norfolk helping two specific groups ‚Äì children and young adults with disabilities and those who are affected by cancer, either directly or indirectly, or those carrying out research into the disease, especially sarcoma and breast cancer. The GeeWizz slogan is #transparentgiving, based on the principles of transparent and accountable fundraising to ensure every donor and fundraiser knows exactly where their money is spent and how it changes many lives of those supported. In April 2010, Long launched the very first Sir Bobby's Online Auction, a global fundraiser held in memory of her dear friend and former England manager Sir Bobby Robson. The two-week online auction, held annually until 2015, featured luxury ‚Äòmoney-can‚Äôt-buy‚Äô items from the world of sport, celebrity and lifestyle raising hundreds of thousands of pounds for the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, Breakthrough Breast Cancer and other charities. The likes of Wayne Rooney, Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho have all supported the global fundraiser in the past. Long then launched the Ultimate Charity Auction, a global online auction offering unique money-can't-buy prizes supported by football clubs around the world as well as FIFA, UEFA and other global industry leaders. Since its inception, the auction - which works in partnership with the League Managers Association and global, national and regional media - has raised more than ¬£1 million for national and local charities, along with supporting specific mental health programmes, funding crucial cancer research and funding life-changing equipment for children living with life-threatening conditions. She was a founder member of the Suffolk Breakthrough Breast Cancer group and in August 2015, Long and close friends celebrated raising ¬£1 million for the charity. Long took the lead in implementing an East Anglian-based special events fundraising committee of the Prince's Trust, chairing it for two of her 10 years and helping to raise more than ¬£480,000, and later became chair of the special events committee of East Anglia's Children's Hospice, covering Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and North Essex. Long continues to devotes her life to running the GeeWizz charity - alongside advising many other charities and mentoring students and entrepreneurs throughout the UK. Personal life Gina Long is married to Andrew with two children and five step-children. The couple annually host the Classic Sports Cars by the Lake, along with a committee, raising substantial funds and awareness for St Nicholas Hospice Care. The community event includes over 800 vintage cars, attracting over 5,000 people and has become a renowned attraction every September, raising over ¬£350,000 to date. In April 2017, Long was joined by close friend Lisa Lumley in completing the London Marathon to raise money and awareness for Sarcoma UK. She successfully completed the challenge, raising over ¬£18,000 despite joking that she could barely run a minute when she started training. Long and Lumley were supporting the national cancer charity after her daughter, then aged just 23, was diagnosed with a Myxoid Liposarcoma in September 2013. Long has pledged to always fundraise for Sarcoma UK alongside her work with GeeWizz and other national, regional and local charities - in a mentoring and campaigning capacity - plus working with many families throughout the UK.

She was part of a class of three, built in France for the Romanian Navy in 1888. She and her two sister ships saw service during World War I. Construction and specifications Along with her two sister ships, NƒÉluca and Sborul, she was built at Casa de Forges et Chantiers de la M√©dit√©ran√©e in Le Havre, France. She was built and commissioned in 1888. She displaced 56 tons, measuring 36.78 meters in length. Top speed amounted to 16 knots, generated by a 540 hp steam engine. Armament consisted of two five-barreled 37 mm Hotchkiss revolving guns, two 356 mm torpedo tubes and one spar torpedo.Roger Chesneau, N. J. M. Campbell, Conway's All the world Fighting Ships 1860-1905, Mayflower Books, 1979, p. 419 Smeul's sisters were rebuilt in 1907, their boilers and chimneys being reduced from two to one. During this refit, the two 37 mm revolving guns were replaced by one machine gun. They had a crew of 20 and drew 2.13 meters (7 feet) of water, carrying 7 tons of coal.Roger Chesneau, N. J. M. Campbell, Conway's All the world Fighting Ships 1906-1921, Mayflower Books, 1979, p. 421 Thus, Smeul was the only one of her class to retain her original armament of two 37 mm revolving guns. This allowed her to effectively engaged enemy ground troops, aircraft and submarines.Cristian CrƒÉciunoiu, Romanian navy torpedo boats, Modelism, 2003, p. 24 Service Commanded by Captain Nicolae Gon»õa, she fought the only naval engagement at sea of the Romanian Navy during the entire First World War, due in part to her being the only Romanian sea-going warship able to engage an enemy ship in combat. The engagement took place on 30 September 1916, near Sulina, when the German submarine UB-42 launched a torpedo at Smeul as the latter was escorting two minesweeping motorboats. However, the torpedo missed and the Romanian torpedo boat counterattacked, damaging the submarine's periscope and conning tower and forcing her to retreat.Constantin CumpƒÉnƒÉ, Corina Apostoleanu, Amintiri despre o flota pierduta ‚Äì vol.

Kusuma Perera was born on 12 December 1925 in Kotte the second of four children to Awis Perera, an Ayurvedic physician and Caroline Hamine. Kusuma received her education at Ananda Sastralaya and Anula Vidyalaya before entered the University of Colombo. On 24 August 1950 she married Konara Mudiyanselage Podiappuhamy Rajaratne, a teacher and lecturer, whom she had known since her school days at Ananda Sastralaya. Her husband stood as a candidate for Welimada at the 1952 parliamentary election but failed to get elected after coming third. On 26 August 1955 the district court in Badulla convicted Rajaratne, who had been his own election agent at the 1952 parliamentary election, of not submitting his election expenses and fined him Rs. 100. He stood as the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) candidate for Welimada at the 1956 parliamentary election, winning the election. On 1 October 1956 an election judge ruled that the 1956 parliamentary election in Welimada was void because Rajaratne had been disqualified from being a Member of Parliament for three years following his 1955 conviction. As a result, he lost his seat in Parliament. In the subsequent by-election held on 7 September 1957 Kusuma ran as an independent, where she secured 14,069 votes, just over 80% of the total vote, defeating both the National Liberation Front (NLF) and Sri Lanka Freedom Party candidates, who combined only received under 19% of the total vote. At the 4th parliamentary election in March 1960 she stood down from representing Welidama allowing her husband to re-contest the seat. Kusuma however ran in the newly created adjoining seat of Uva Paranagama, as the National Liberation Front (Jathika Vimukthi Peramuna) candidate, which she won, receiving 4,662 votes (40% of the total votes). She retained the seat at the subsequent parliamentary elections in July 1960, with an increased majority, receiving 6,473 votes (56.88% of the total votes). Kusuma also successfully contested the 1965 parliamentary elections, where she was the sole parliamentary representative of National Liberation Front, her husband failing in his attempt to be re-elected for the seat of Welimada. Kusama was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister of Home Affairs in the Third Dudley Senanayake cabinet but resigned the post in 1966 in protest against the Government's decision to introduce new laws to facilitate the official use of Tamil in administration.

She joined the Opera in 1953 and switched from a mezzo to soprano on the persuasion of her teacher Clive Carey. June left the company in 1963 and also won a gold medal at the Sofia International Competition for young opera singers. She rejoined Sadler's Wells Opera seven years later and made her first performance in the United States in 1974 with the San Francisco Opera. June's last professional appearance as a singer came in 1983 and retired the following year to enter into a coaching role for the next generation of singers. She also taught with various musical organisations and brought her opera experience to directing productions until 1999. Biography Early life and education She was born Ava June Wiggins on 23 July 1931 at the East End Maternity Home, Commercial Road, in Poplar, East London. Her mother Grace Violet was a tailor and her father George Oliver Wiggins was an employee of the Johnnie Walker whisky company and an carpenter. She was known to June to her family and was evacuated to Oxfordshire when World War II broke out. Upon leaving school at the age of 14, June worked as a dressmaker at the Novello Theatre for the conductor's productions. While working on the costumes for King's Rhapsody, she met the composer in person and encouraged her to take formal lessons. June's first lessons came when she was 16 with the contralto Kate Opperman. In an interview in 2005, she described her as \\"the founder of my voice\\". June studied at the London Opera Centre and received coaching from the soprano Joan Cross. She later studied with the soprano Eva Turner and with bartone performers Denis Dowling and Clive Carey. It was at the school where June was introduced to the operas of Benjamin Britten. Career In 1953, when she adopted the stage name Ava June, she joined the Sadler's Wells Opera chorus at the age of 19. June was initially a mezzo but was later persuaded by her teacher Clive Carey to switch to soprano roles. She won the Queen's Prize at the Royal College of Music in 1955. June's performances in the chorus led to her appointment as a principal soloist for the 1957‚Äì58 season. Her solo career began with ‚Äúa promising Musetta‚Äù in La boh√®me and followed this by playing The Foreign Women in The Consul by Gian Carlo Menotti. June's 1958 Covent Garden debut saw her perform as the Heavenly Voice in Luchino Visconti's production of Don Carlos by Giuseppe Verdi and was conducted by Carlo Maria Giulini. When Fidelio returned the next year under Rudolf Schwarz, June sang Marcellina and repeated this performance in 1960 but with Colin Davis as the conductor. That same year, she made her first (and only) appearance with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra under Alexander Gibson as Abigaille in Verdi's Nabucco with concert performances in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Also in 1960, June participated in a production of Georges Bizet's Les p√™cheurs de perles with the tenor Charles Craig. In 1961, she played the role of the May Queen in Edward German's Merrie England, and was Tatyana in Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's opera Eugene Onegin in the same year. The following year, June gained the part of Violetta in La traviata and followed this with a performance as a Marenka in The Bartered Bride and Mica√´la in Carmen. Despite being firmly established, June travelled with the tenor Alberto Remedios to Bulgaria to take part in the Sofia International Competition for young opera singers, winning the gold medal, and giving her wider recognition. At the start of the 1963 season, she sang the part of Agathe in Der Freisch√ºtz, and the following year, with Davis conducting, played Ilia in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Idomeneo. June sang Butterfly under Mario Bernardi towards the conclusion of 1964. She left Sadler Wells Opera in 1963. June's 1965 performance as the countess in the production of The Marriage of Figaro conducted by Charles Mackerras received strong praise from the critic Desmond Shawe-Taylor. The following year, she sung the part of Rosalinda in Die Fledermaus and later Lisa in The Queen of Spades. Other roles she played were Donna Elvira and Marzelline. Her first performance with the Welsh National Opera came in 1968 as Marguerite in La traviata. June was united with her mentor Joan Cross the next year and reprised her 1965 performance of The Marriage of Figaro but with the Phoenix Opera. She later sang Donna Anna in Don Giovanni at the Coliseum in John Blatchley's production with Mackerras acting as the conductor. She rejoined Sadlers' Wells Opera in 1970 as a member of the London Coliseum ensemble. That same year, June sang Sieglinde in Die Walk√ºre under Reginald Goodall and her voice was heard on the recording. She sang Frau Schomberg in the world premiere of Richard Rodney Bennett's Victory. June also made her first appearance in The Proms in 1970 by performing in Das Rheingold with Georg Solti as the conductor. She sang opposite Don Garrard as Judith in Bluebeard's Castle and then played Queen Elizabeth in Benjamin Britten's Gloriana in 1972. June reprised her role as Elizabeth but in Gaetano Donizetti's Maria Stuarda. She made her first appearance in the United States in 1974 as Ellen Orford in a production of Britten's Peter Grimes with the San Francisco Opera, and also toured Germany and Eastern Europe. June performed in a 1976 production of Der Rosenkavalier and in that year's Hoffnung Music Festival, she stripped as Salone in Let's Fake an Opera, revealing herself to be Fidelio about to shoot Kenneth Woollam's Otello in Lohengrin's armour. Among her final assignments for the English National Opera (renamed from Sadler's Wells Opera in 1974), were the creations of roles for her of Grande Blanche in David Blake's Toussaint in 1977. June's final years with the English National Opera saw her return to mezzo-soprano rules, and she played the role as a strident Katy in Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's production K√°≈•a Kabanov√° with Mackerras again acting as conductor. She created and played Countess Vronskaya in the world premiere of Iain Hamilton's Anna Karenina in 1981. June made her last appearance as a singer in a production of Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier in 1983. Later life and death She retired from signing in 1984 after losing her voice and moved from Kensington to a quieter location in Twickenham Green. June passed on her experience to the younger generation of signers of the English National Opera as a coach and also gave masterclasses for several organisations including the International Association of Wagner Societies and the National Opera Studio. After stints with the Morley College, the Royal College of Music, Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, she became a professor at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester in 1985 and remained in the post for the next fourteen years. June's pupils included Rosalind Plowright, Susan Bullock and Janice Kelly. She also brought her experience of opera to directing by creating productions of Charles Gounod's Rom√©o et Juliette, La traviata, and Nabucco for Wilmslow Opera in Cheshire. June also directed Die Fledermaus for the Carl Rosa Opera Company and latterly took on the direction of a choir of senior citizens for the University of the Third Age. Following the death of her husband of more than 30 years, the architectural engineer David Cooper in 1982, she became an active member of the London Spiritual Mission in Notting Hill Gate and became a soloist. June died at Kingston Hospital, London from sepsis brought about by an infection and pneumonia on 22 February 2013 at the age of 81.

The basic mechanism resembles that of spontaneous Raman spectroscopy: a pump photon, of the angular frequency \\\\omega_p, which is absorbed by a molecule has some small probability of inducing some vibrational (or rotational) transition, as opposed to inducing a simple Rayleigh transition. This makes the molecule emit a photon at a shifted frequency. However, SRS, as opposed to spontaneous Raman spectroscopy, is a third-order non-linear phenomenon involving a second photon‚Äîthe Stokes photon of angular frequency \\\\omega_S‚Äîwhich stimulates a specific transition. When the difference in frequency between both photons (\\\\omega_p-\\\\omega_S) resembles that of a specific vibrational (or rotational) transition (\\\\omega_ u) the occurrence of this transition is resonantly enhanced. In SRS, the signal is equivalent to changes in the intensity of the pump and Stokes beams. Employing a pump laser beam of a constant frequency and a Stokes laser beam of a scanned frequency (or vice versa) allows for the unraveling of the spectral fingerprint of the molecule. This spectral fingerprint differs from those obtained by other spectroscopy methods such as Rayleigh scattering as the Raman transitions confer to different exclusion rules than those that apply for Rayleigh transitions. History The phenomenon of SRS was discovered by an accident by Woodbury and Ng in 1962. In their experiment, they introduced a cell containing nitrobenzene into a ruby laser cavity. This resulted with a strong emission at a wavelength that could not be associated with the characteristic wavelengths of the ruby gain medium. At first, this was explained as luminescence. Only at a later stage was this was interpreted correctly as the first experimental observation of SRS. A year later, Garmier et al. introduced a two-wave mixing framework for the description of SRS. These pioneering works opened a new avenue of research and were followed by many theoretical and experimental works in the field of SRS. Principle Molecule's energy levels and the SRS transition Qualitative description The principle of SRS can be intuitively understood by adopting the quantum mechanical description of the molecule's energy levels. Initially, the molecule lies in the ground state, that is, its lowest electronic energy level. Then, it simultaneously absorbs both pump and Stokes photons, which causes a vibrational (or rotational) transition with some probability. The transition can be thought of as a two-step transition where in the first step the molecule is excited by the pump photon to a virtual state and in the second it is relaxed into a vibrational (or rotational) state other than the ground state. The virtual state, which is actually a superposition of probability tails of real states, cannot be occupied by the molecule. However, for a simultaneous absorption of two photons, it might provide a coupling route between the initial and final states. When the energy difference between both pump and Stokes photons matches the energy difference between some vibrational (or rotational) state and the ground state, the probability for a transition due to this stimulated process is enhanced by orders of magnitude. Quantitative description Each photon that undergoes SRS is shifted in color from pump to Stokes color. Thus, the SRS signal is proportional to the decrease or increase in the pump or Stokes beams intensities, respectively. These changes in the beams intensities are described by the following rate equations :\\\\frac{dI_S}{dz}=g_R I_pI_S-\\\\alpha I_S, :\\\\frac{dI_p}{dz}=-\\\\frac{\\\\omega_p}{\\\\omega_S} g_\\\\mathrm{R}I_pI_S-\\\\alpha I_p, where, I_p and I_S are the pump and Stokes beams intensities, respectively, \\\\omega_p and \\\\omega_S are the pump and Stokes angular frequencies, respectively, z is the coordinate along which the beams propagate, g_R is the Raman gain coefficient, and \\\\alpha is the loss coefficient. The loss coefficient is an effective coefficient that might account for loses due to a variety of processes such as Rayleigh scattering, absorption, etc. The first rate equation describes the change in Stokes beam intensity along the SRS interaction length. The first term on the right-hand side is equivalent to the amount of intensity gained by the Stokes beam due to SRS. As SRS involves both beams, this term is dependent both on I_p and I_S. The second term is equivalent to the amount of intensity lost and is thus dependent only on I_S. The second rate equation describes the change in pump beam intensity, its form is quite similar to the former. The first term on the right hand side of the second equation equals its counterpart from the first equation up to a multiplicative factor of -\\\\omega_p/\\\\omega_S. This factor reflects the fact that each photon (as opposed to intensity units) lost from the pump beam due to SRS is gained by the Stokes beam. In most cases, the experimental conditions support two simplifying assumptions: (1) photon loss along the Raman interaction length, \\\\Delta z, is negligible. Mathematically this corresponds to :\\\\alpha/g_R\\\\ll I_p,I_S and (2) the change in beam intensity is linear; mathematically this corresponds to :g_R\\\\cdot \\\\Delta z\\\\cdot Max(I_p,I_S)\\\\ll 1. Accordingly, the SRS signal, that is, the intensity changes in pump and Stokes beams is approximated by :\\\\Delta I_S\\\\simeq g_\\\\mathrm{R}I_{p,0}I_{S,0}\\\\Delta z, :\\\\Delta I_p\\\\simeq-\\\\frac{\\\\omega_p}{\\\\omega_S}g_\\\\mathrm{R}I_{p,0}I_{S,0}\\\\Delta z, where I_{p,0} and I_{S,0} are the initial pump and Stokes beams intensities, respectively. As for the Raman interaction length, in many cases this length can be evaluated in a similar fashion to the evaluation of the Rayleigh length as :\\\\Delta z=4\\\\pi n \\\\omega_0^2/(\\\\lambda_p+\\\\lambda_S). Here, n and \\\\omega_0 are the averaged refractive index and beam waist, respectively, and \\\\lambda_p and \\\\lambda_S are the pump and Stokes wavelengths, respectively. Every molecule has some characteristic Raman shifts, each associated with a specific vibrational (or rotational) transition of the molecule. The relation between a Raman shift, \\\\Delta\\\\omega, and the pump and Stokes photon wavelengths is given by :\\\\Delta\\\\omega[\\\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}]=\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_p[\\\\mathrm{nm}]}-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_S[\\\\mathrm{nm}]}\\\\right)\\\\times\\\\frac{[10^7\\\\mathrm{nm}]}{[\\\\mathrm{cm}]} When the difference in wavelengths between both lasers is close to some Raman transition, the Raman gain coefficient g_R receives values on the order of 10^{-30}[\\\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\\\mathrm{molecule}\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{sr}] resulting with an efficient SRS. As this difference starts to differ from a specific Raman transition the value of the Raman gain coefficient drops down and the process becomes increasingly less efficient and less detectable. An SRS experimental setup includes two laser beams (usually co-linear) of the same polarization, one is employed as pump and the other as Stokes. Usually, at least one of the lasers is pulsed. This modulation in the laser intensity helps to detect the signal, furthermore, it helps increase the signal's amplitude, which also helps detection. When designing the experimental setup, one has great liberty when choosing the pump and Stokes lasers as the Raman condition (shown in the equation above) applies only on the difference in wavelengths. Comparison with other Raman spectroscopy variants Since SRS is a resonantly enhanced process, its signal is several orders of magnitude higher than that of a spontaneous Raman scattering, making it a much more efficient spectroscopic tool. Furthermore, the signal intensity of SRS is also several orders of magnitude higher than another highly common sort of spectroscopy ‚Äì coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy. SRS involves only two photons, as opposed to the latter, which involves three photons. Thus, the occurrence of SRS is more probable and results with a higher signal. There are two additional prominent variants of spontaneous Raman spectroscopy ‚Äì surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and resonance Raman spectroscopy. The former is designated for Raman spectroscopy of molecules adsorbed on rough surfaces such as metal surfaces or nanostructures where it magnifies the Raman signal by many orders of magnitude. The latter corresponds to a spontaneous Raman scattering process performed by a laser with a frequency close to the electronic transition of the subject in study. This may amplify of the signal. However, it requires the use of highly powerful UV or X-ray lasers that might cause photodegradation and might also induce fluorescence. Applications SRS is employed in various applications from a wide variety of fields. All applications utilize the ability of SRS to detect a vibrational (or rotational) spectral signature of the subject in study. Here are some examples: Study of molecular conformational structures Works in this field were done both in the Cina and Bar groups. Each conformer is associated with a slightly different SRS spectral signature. Detection of these different landscapes is an indication of the different conformational structures of the same molecule. Material composition analysis Here, the SRS signal dependence on the concentration of the material is utilized. Measuring different SRS signals, associated with the different materials in the composition, allow for the determination of the stoichiometric relations of the composition. Microscopy Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy allows non-invasive label-free imaging in living tissue. In this method, pioneered by the Xie group, a construction of an image is obtained by performing SRS measurements over some grid, where each measurement adds a pixel to the image. Recently, SRS imaging starts to appear in material science researches. In 2018, Yang and Min groups at Columbia University used SRS imaging to visualize ion transport in battery electrolyte and its correlation with lithium dendrite growth. Ultrafast microscopy Employing femtosecond laser pulses, as was done in the Katz, Silberberg, and Xie groups, allows for an instant generation of a very large portion of the spectral signature by a single laser pulse. The broad signal is a result of the width of the laser band as dictated by the uncertainty principle, which determines an inverse proportion between the uncertainty in time and uncertainty in frequency. This method is far faster than traditional microscopy methods as it circumvents the need in long and time-consuming frequencies scanning.

Accessed Jul 9, 2019.) were a series of protests that occurred following the appointment of Francophone judges in English-speaking areas of the Republic of Cameroon. In October 2016, protests began in two primarily English-speaking regions: the Northwest Region and the Southwest Region. On November 23, 2016, it was reported that at least two people were killed and 100 protesters were arrested in Bamenda, a city in the Northwest Region. In September 2017, the protests and the government's response to them escalated into an armed conflict between pro-Ambazonia factions and the Cameroonian government. Causes The protests began on October 6, 2016 as a sit-down strike initiated by the Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium (CACSC), an organization consisting of lawyer and teacher trade unions from the Anglophone regions of Cameroon. The strike was led by Barrister Agbor Balla, Fontem Neba, and Tassang Wilfred. Common law lawyers of Anglophone Cameroons were said to have written an appeal letter to the government over the use of French in schools and courtrooms in the two English-speaking regions of Cameroon. In an effort to protect the English culture, they began a sit-down strike in all courtrooms on October 6, 2016. Peaceful protests began with marches in the cities of Bamenda, Buea, and Limbe calling for the protection of the common law system in Anglophone Cameroon. They asked for the common law system to be practiced in Anglophone courts and not the civil law used by the French- speaking magistrate. Laws such as the OHADA uniform acts, CEMAC code, and others should be translated into English. They also asked that the common law system of education in Anglophone universities such as the University of Buea and the University of Bamenda should be addressed by the creation of a law school. The government responded by sending security forces to fire tear gas and allegedly assault protesters and lawyers. During November 2016 thousands of teachers in the Anglophone regions joined the lawyers to protect English culture in Anglophone Cameroon, asking that the French language not be used in schools and courtrooms in English-speaking regions of Cameroon. All schools were shut down in the Anglophone regions, only two months and three weeks after the start of 2016/2017 academic year. Violence and arrests Within two weeks, more than 100 activists had reportedly been arrested. Six were reported dead. Unconfirmed videos released over social media depicted a variety of violent scenes, including demonstrators \\"parading the dead body of an activist, barricades set ablaze, [and] police brutally beating protesters and firing tear gas against the crowds\\".  President Paul Biya's response  In his yearly New Year's message to the country, Paul Biya discussed the protests and the Anglophone problem (although without mentioning the phrase 'Anglophone problem'). He said, > All the voices that spoke have been heard. They have, in many cases, raised > substantive issues that cannot be overlooked. I have enjoined the Government > to engage in frank dialogue with the various parties concerned to find > appropriate solutions to the issues raised. I urge them to participate, > without any bias, in the various discussions. However, we should never > forget that we are walking in the footsteps of our country's founding > fathers, our national heroes, who shed their blood to bequeath to posterity > a nation that is united in its diversity. Cameroon's unity is, therefore, a > precious legacy with which no one should take liberties. Any claim, no > matter how relevant, loses its legitimacy once it jeopardizes, even > slightly, the building of national unity. Do I need to repeat this? Cameroon > is one and indivisible! It shall so remain. Government dialogue In response, the government of Cameroon created an ad hoc committee to dialogue with members of the CACSC led by Tassang Wilfred in Bamenda from the Consortium and minister Jacques Fame Ndongo in January 2017. The first meeting was not fruitful, as the consortium members demanded the government release all arrested before any dialogue; more cases of arrest continued and were condemned by the Consortium members in the bid to solve the Anglophone problems. They presented a draft for federalism which was condemned by the government, and on January 17, 2017, through a ministerial decree signed by minister Rene Emmanuel Sadi, the CACSC and SCNC were banned in Cameroon, and their activities were described as illegal and against the security and unity of Cameroon. A few days later, two members of the Cameroon civil society were arrested, Agbor Balla and Fontem Neba. International reaction More than 13,000 Anglophone Cameroonians residing in Maryland began to protest and called for international bodies to help stop the arrests and marginalization in Cameroon. On June 27, United States Congressman Anthony G. Brown filed a petition with the United States Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, to call for the government of Cameroon to immediately show concern and solve the ongoing crises. The United States condemned the loss of life and brutality against Anglophone protesters. Internet outage Around January 17, 2017, reports emerged that an Internet blockade had been implemented in major cities of the Northwest and Southwest Regions of Cameroon; many suspected it was a government ploy to disorganize and stamp out the Anglophone protests. September 22, 2017 On Friday, September 22, 2017, thousands of protesters came to the street demanding full independence across villages, towns, and cities in Southern Cameroons. In Buea, the capital of Southern Cameroons, freedom fighters took down a national flag outside a police station while officers looked on and hoisted the blue and white striped flag of Ambazonia (Southern Cameroons), while young boys painted their faces blue and white to represent the territory and chanted \\"We want freedom\\". About eight people were reportedly killed, with photos circulating in social media. On Friday, President Paul Biya, who had been in power for 35 years, was addressing the UN General Assembly in New York, and thousands of Anglophone protesters rallied for independence at the UN headquarters, led by Ayaba Cho Lucas, Sisiku Tabe Ayuk, Barrister Bobga Harmony, and others. October 1, 2017 Anglophone Cameroonians declared independence from Francophone Cameroon on Sunday, October 1, 2017. Peaceful marches took place on the streets of the English-speaking regions; the protests occurred in several towns: Buea, Bamenda, Kumba, Kumbo, and Mamfe. Protesters carried leaves to symbolize freedom and sang songs as they celebrated their independence. The government responded by deploying fully armed soldiers to Anglophone regions. On October 2, Amnesty International reported that at least 17 people were killed in a military confrontation.

His career at An T√∫r Gloine spanned from 1920 until 1943; thereafter he produced very few works in the medium. Along with Ethel Rhind and Catherine O'Brien he was one of the artists at the studio who worked in opus-sectile mosaic, a side-line of the studio. Hubert McGoldrick was also an occasional illustrator and his most recognised illustration is the Magnificat Anima Mea Dominum created for the Legion of Mary.  Early life and education  Hubert McGoldrick was the youngest of 9 children. Around the time of his birth the family moved to a substantial red-bricked house in Rathgar, Dublin, where he was to live until his death.Caron, Thomas David. An T√∫r Gloine and Michael Healy (1873 ‚Äì1941) unpublished PhD thesis, Trinity College Dublin, 1991 McGoldrick is first recorded as having attended classes at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art (now National College of Art and Design, Dublin, when aged thirteen. Two years later, in 1913, he joined Messrs Earley and Company of Upper Camden Street Dublin, a stained glass company which had been operating in the city since 1852.White, James and Wynne, Michael. Irish Stained Glass; A Catalogue of Irish Stained Glass Windows by Irish Artists of the 20th Century. The Furrow Trust, Gill and Sons, Dublin, 1988, p.43 During his apprenticeship he continued attending classes at the DMSA and under Alfred E. Child's supervision he executed a panel of his own design. In 1918 McGoldrick exhibited three designs for stained glass at the Royal Hibernian Academy Annual Exhibition, which may indicate that he saw himself as an artist and not as a typical Earley's worker who manufactured (albeit superior) windows to fairly standard stock designs and patterns. Two years later, in 1920, he was invited to join An T√∫r Gloine at a stage when the studio was particularly busy undertaking commissions for war memorial windows. Hubert McGoldrick was the first male and the first Catholic to join the studio since Michael Healy's arrival some fifteen years earlier. Like Healy, he was a devout Catholic but in personality was very different; while Healy was reclusive and introvert, McGoldrick was theatrical and flamboyant.  Stained glass career  Two-light window Christ of the Sacred Heart appearing to St. Margaret Mary at St Brendan's Cathedral, Loughrea Hubert McGoldrick worked consistently at An T√∫r Gloine from when he first joined in 1920 until 1943 when the artist and unofficial manager, Sarah Purser, died and reluctantly the two remaining artists, McGoldrick and Catherine O'Brien, decided to dissolve the cooperative studio; thereafter McGoldrick produced little stained glass. His first window, Sorrow and Joy, for Gowran, County Kilkenny, indicates a strongly developed personal style and choice of palette which would have been quite at variance to the prevalent house-style at Earley and Company from where he had come. Like Harry Clarke and Michael Healy he revelled in rich detail, particularly evident in his works of the 1920s. One of his finest windows was produced early in his An T√∫r Gloine career, The Sacred Heart appearing to Saint Margaret Mary,Caron, David T. An T√∫r Gloine Stained Glass Windows and Mosaic Stations of the Cross in St Brendan's Cathedral, Loughrea, unpublished BSc thesis, National College of Art and Design, 1982, pp.35‚Äî42 (1925) for St Brendan's Cathedral, Loughrea,McGreevy, Thomas. \\"St Brendan's Cathedral, Loughrea, 1897 ‚Äì 1947\\", The Capuchin Annual, Dublin, 1946-1947. pp.353 ‚Äì 373 County Galway; already by the mid 1920s this cathedral was well on its way to becoming a showcase for work by all but one (Wilhelmina Geddes) of the significant artists that worked at An T√∫r Gloine ‚Äî and the Irish arts and crafts movement generally ‚Äî and McGoldrick may well have recognised its potential as a premium venue to display his artistry. This window revels in warm colours and features little vignettes. Perhaps his most outstanding window, and one of the most unusual commissions to come to the studio, was a massive lunette, The Spirit of Morning (1926‚Äî27), for a private home in Singapore, which following many years in storage is now on public display in the Penang Colonial Museum, Malaysia. Of all McGoldrick's works this one has the most sense of the period that it was created in, possibly since the secular subject matter allowed a more contemporary representation of womanhood.Caron, David. \\"From Dublin to the Far East ‚Äî An T√∫r Gloine Stained Glass in Singapore\\", The Irish Arts Review Yearbook, 2001, Vol 17, pp.114 ‚Äì 121 By this stage An T√∫r Gloine was receiving several substantial international commissions (championed in the U.S. by renowned Boston-based stained glass designer Charles Connick) and McGoldrick was among five other of the studio's artists whose work featured in the Chapel of the Sacred Heart, Newton Country Day School, Newton, Massachusetts which, unusually, featured only female saints, McGoldrick's being a rose window depicting The Sacred Heart (1927) and a three-light depicting St Margaret Mary (1927). In the 1930s another commission to fill an entire U.S. church with An T√∫r Gloine stained glass came to the studio, again for a secondary school chapel, this time for the Chapel of Brophy College Preparatory, Phoenix, Arizona and he depicted Symbols of the Blessed Virgin Mary; the burning bush and the lily among the thorns (1936).Caron, David. \\"An T√∫r Gloine Stained Glass in Arizona\\", The Irish Arts Review Yearbook, 1994, Vol 10, pp.174 ‚Äì 180 McGoldrick's final overseas commission was for a crematorium chapel in Karori, near Wellington, New Zealand; his Gethsemane (1939) was one of six An T√∫r Gloine created for this small chapel.

McGoldrick\\", Father Mathew Record, Dublin, Vol 36, No 7, July 1942. pp.4‚Äî8 he eschews the detail often prevalent in his earlier work for a simplified approach often using deep shades of blue and red and little aciding. Worthy of note, is that alongside his stained glass career at An T√∫r Gloine, McGoldrick also worked in opus-sectile mosaic, a type of mosaic that does not ustilise the familiar tesserae but instead uses larger custom-cut pieces and in this manner resembles the structure of stained glass windows. His greatest achievement in this medium is a series of Stations of the Cross for the Catholic Church, Westport, County Mayo (1929‚Äì1931). Additionally he was an occasional illustrator and his most recognised illustration, the Magnificat Anima Mea Dominum, was commissioned for the Legion of Mary by its founder Frank DuffMartin, Marguerite M. \\"Legion of Mary Picture\\", Queen of All Hearts, New York, Jan‚ÄìFeb, 1972. pp.8‚Äî10 and it was, and continues to be, widely reproduced in the organisation's literature.

Also known as the Mandolin Man, Etzioni is best known as a founder of, and bassist for, the band Lone Justice. He is a noted record producer and has released three solo albums.  Biography Early years Etzioni grew up in Brooklyn, then moved to Los Angeles. His grandfather sparked an early interest in country music by compiling mix tapes, and gifting Etzioni a mandolin at age eight. In high school, Etzioni sang and played drums in the band Prudence Goodbody. In 1976, Etzioni led the band Model, who shared stages with the Plimsouls and the Motels. Model recorded with producers Chuck Plotkin and Richard Baskin, but nothing was officially released. Then in 1980 Etzioni began performed solo acoustic gigs in Los Angeles. Lone Justice In 1982, Etzioni met Ryan Hedgecock, who shared his love for country and roots music. Hedgecock was already performing with Maria McKee. Hedgecock and McKee asked Etzioni to back them on bass duties, along with drummer Don Heffington and the band Lone Justice was launched. Etzioni was a member of Lone Justice from 1983 to 1986, during which he encouraged them to write original material, and contributed the songs \\"East of Eden,\\" \\"Working Late,\\" \\"You Are the Light,\\" and \\"Soap, Soup and Salvation\\" (written with McKee). In 1993, Etzioni and Heffington backed McKee on her solo album You Gotta Sin to Get Saved, and were part of her band in the subsequent tour. Production and songwriting Etzioni has produced for numerous artists, including Peter Case, Counting Crows, and Toad the Wet Sprocket. Etzioni's compositions have been covered by Cheap Trick, Victoria Williams, Julie Miller and Judy Collins. Etzioni produced and wrote songs with the Williams Brothers (Andy Williams' nephews Andrew and David). Together with David Williams, Etzioni co-wrote \\"Can't Cry Hard Enough\\" which became his most successful song. Solo recordings In the 1990s, Etzioni recorded and released three albums: The Mandolin Man (1991), Bone (1992) and Weapons of the Spirit (1994). Etzioni employs the analog-vinyl-digital (AVD) technique, in which his master tapes are converted first to vinyl, and the vinyl is recorded to digital for the final product. In 2012, Etzioni released the 2-disc album Marvin Country on Nine Mile Records. On the album, which had been in development since 1985, Etzioni played mandolin, mandocello, guitar, bass, piano, Mellotron, porchboard and keyboards. Included are duets with Lucinda Williams (\\"Lay It on the Table\\"), Steve Earle (\\"Ain't No Work in Mississippi\\"), Richard Thompson (\\"It Don't Cost Much\\"), Buddy Miller (\\"Living Like a Hobo\\"), John Doe (\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\")., Maria McKee (\\"You Possess Me\\"), and the Dixie Hummingbirds (\\"You Are the Light\\"). For most songs, the backing band was Heffington (drums), Steve Fishell (pedal steel), Gurf Morlix (bass), Tammy Rogers (fiddle), and Buddy Miller and Duane Jarvis (guitar). Sin City All Stars Etzioni was part of the Sin City All Stars which was a one-off band for a 2004 Gram Parsons tribute concert that was captured and released on both CD and DVD. Thee Holy Brothers Long-time friends Etzioni and Willie Aron (of the band Balancing Act) collaborated as Thee Holy Brothers, and released the album My Name Is Sparkle on the Peermusic label. Their band name was provided by their rabbi. Nine songs are presented in two acts, addressing the topic of spiritual grace. Thematically, the album has been likened to George Harrison's All Things Must Pass and Pete Townshend's Who Came First.

While originally heavily viewed as the favorite to win the election, Zyuganov saw his early lead slip over the course of the election and was ultimately handed a decisive defeat by incumbent Boris Yeltsin in the runoff election. Background and early developments Zyuganov entered the election season with major factors in his favor, and was initially considered to be the frontrunner. The success of his party in the 1995 legislative elections earned Zyguyanov an invaluable resource, namely momentum. Zyuganov argued that the results of the 1995 election showed that \\"anticommunist\\" sentiments were not prominent amongst the electorate. As a result of his showing, and the poor showing of pro-reformist parties, in the 1995 legislative elections, at the start of the year 1996, most observers (both domestic and foreign) believed that Zyuganov would win in a free and fair presidential election. So convinced was the Communist Party in Zyuganov's prospects, that before his campaign even began they had already begun discussing who would be appointed in his presidential administration. Early on, Zyuganov benefited from a portion of the Russian electorate perceiving him to be a more favorable alternative to other opposition candidates, such as Alexander Lebed and Vladimir Zhirinovsky. One of the advantages that Zyuganov enjoyed was the fact that his candidacy was backed by a genuine political party structure. Following their disappointing showing in the 1993 legislative election, the Communist Party had spent put an immense effort into rebuilding their party's national grassroots organization. The strength of that effort had been demonstrated with the party's success in the 1995 legislative election. In rebuilding the party, the party had reactivated its youth wing (Komsomol), strengthened relations with trade unions and women's groups sympathetic to the communist cause, and had begun to court business figures who they hoped could be convinced would benefit from a \\"stable future\\" under a CPRF leadership. The party had also figured out means of circumventing the obstacles presented by their limited campaign funds. Instead of being used for official parliamentary business, the party's parliamentary resources (including phones, faxes, office space and personnel) were utilized for campaign-related purposes. Additionally, Zyguyanov and other members of the party used the travel privileges they were granted in their capacity as deputies in the Duma in order to make trips to Russia's various regions (often by train). They utilized government trips as unofficial campaign visits. In January 1996, Zyuganov took steps to better situate himself for the presidential election. To improve the image of the communists, his party elected Gennadiy Seleznyov as Chairman of the State Duma on January 17.http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/RP96-70/RP96-70.pdf Seleznyov was considered a charismatic politician. Zyuganov himself traveled on a tour of western nations in an attempt to reassure the international community that a Communist victory would not threaten foreign investment in Russia. Securing the Communist Party nomination Following the legislative election, an internal poll revealed that nearly 20% of the Communist Party's members would prefer a \\"more charismatic\\" candidate for president. It was suggested that Anatoly Lukyanov, Aman Tuleyev or Pyotr Romanov might challenge Zyuganov for the party's nomination. In order to assure that his potential challengers within the party would have no time to organize campaign efforts, Zyuganov convened a party assembly one month after the legislative election where the nominee was voted upon. Preventing \\"spoiler\\" candidates After securing his party's nomination, Zyuganov made an effort to prevent spoiler candidates from arising. He worked to receive the endorsements of other political parties and movements. He first looked to solidify his support from the left. He moved to secure his position as the leading candidate of the left-wing by seeking assurance from a number of potential left-wing candidates that they would not run for president and would instead lend their support to his candidacy. As a result of the Communist Party's performance in the legislative election, Zyuganov was easily able to unite the majority of opposition parties and movements behind his candidacy. He received and early endorsement from the Union of Communist Parties, as well as a reluctant one from the Russian Communist Workers Party. By the end of February, Zyuganov had secured the backing of the three largest leftist political organizations that had failed to win any seats in the 1995 legislative elections. These were the Labour Russia, Agrarian Party of Russia and Power to the People. The far-left Labour Russia's leader, Viktor Anpilov, had originally stated that he would seek-out a candidate that promised to liquidate the office of the presidency, restore Soviet power, and reverse all privatization. Zyuganov had not publicly promised to pursue any of Anpilov's stated criteria. Nonetheless, in early January, Anpilov reversed his stance at the 5th Party Congress of the Communist Labor Russia party, announcing that his party would support Zyuganov's candidacy. The Agrarian Party's leader, Mikhail Lapshin, announced in the final week of January that his party was also going to back Zyuganov. Power to the People's head, Nikolai Ryzhkov (who had been Yeltsin's main opponent in the 1991 election), announced his party's support of Zyuganov in early February. At the start of the election campaign, Zyuganov had the strongest base of support of any candidate. By securing such broad support so early in the campaign, Zyuganov helped to solidify his position as a frontrunner and as the leading opposition candidate. Campaign strategy Zyuganov and his political advisors were convinced that all Russian voters existed somewhere on a venn-diagram of political ideologies consisting of democrats, communists or nationalists. They believed that the three ideologies were about equal in their membership. Thus, Zyuganov and his advisors were convinced that by securing the support of the latter two groups, he would be able to win the election. Heading into the 1996 election season, the prospects of such as strategy seemed rather strong. If Zyuganov could rely on the support of the twenty-one million voters that had voted CPRF and Russia's two other communist parties in the 1995 parliamentary election, as well as the eight million voters who had voted for Russia's various nationalist parties (not including Zhirinovsky's LDPR), he would be able to win the first round of the election and secure himself as the frontrunner to win the second round. Zyuganov benefited, overall, from the weak field of candidates in the election. The incumbent Boris Yeltsin held single-digit approval ratings at the start of the campaign. Polling showed that most Russians believed that they had been better off when they were under communist control than they were now under Yeltsin's leadership. While both Alexander Lebed and Grigory Yavlinsky defeated Zyuganov in hypothetical polling for the second-round, neither of their campaigns had reasonable odds of making it beyond the first round. Zyuganov was so strongly viewed as a front runner that when he attended the February 1996 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Western leaders lined up to meet him, viewing him to be the likely be the next president of Russia. Zyuganov's campaign believed it was even possible to win the election outright in the first round of voting. Zyuganov's campaign aimed to make the election a referendum on the tenure of Yeltsin. Zyuganov positioned his campaign as being against what he considered to be the failed centrism of Boris Yeltsin's presidency. He believed that centrism had been defeated in the 1995 legislative elections, and would again during the 1996 presidential elections. He dubbed Yeltsin's administration the \\"antinarodnii\\" (anti-people) regime. The campaign also sought to cast Yeltsin's policies as destabilizing and genocidal, while portraying Zyuganov's own policies as fresh and pragmatic. At the Communist Party's congress, many prominent figures had expressed concern that the party needed to broaden its base in order to win. Ryzhkov remarked, \\"Priority No. 1 must be to create a coalition. If the Communist Party joins this battle alone, it will never win.\\" Having already consolidated his base's support early in the year, Zyuganov's campaign shifted their focus on reaching new voters. To do so, Zyuganov's campaign took a strongly nationalist tone. Zyuganov sought to appeal to a variety of emotions amongst segments of the Russian population, including nationalism, nostalgia for its pre-Revolutionary period, and nostalgia for Soviet socialism. Zyuganov's campaign was convinced that patriotic slogans were nearly all that they needed to win the necessary votes. As a result, the campaign delivered nationalist slogans to voters, rather than addressing \\"bread and butter\\" issues. Zyuganov, and his political party, strongly rejected the 'social democratic' label. Consequentially, Zyuganov's campaign neglected making appeals towards members of Russia's fledgling social democratic parties. Additionally, in drastic to contrast to the majority of candidates for leftist parties in post-communist Europe, Zyuganov exhausted little effort towards appealing to trade unions. Campaigning (first round) Early lead Zyuganov started his campaign with a strong lead over Yeltsin. While the frontrunner, there were challenges that Zyuganov faced. He needed to get his message to the voting public, all without wide access to free media. He also needed to appeal to more centrist voters, without losing his base of support. In February, when at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Zyuganov worked to try and calm concerned foreign financiers, who were worried of the ramifications of a communist victory in Russia. To do so, he spoke to them using language that made him sound more like a social democrat than a soviet communist.https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1996/07/22/the-war-for-the- kremlin On March 4, Zyuganov had become the first candidate officially certified to be placed on the ballot. Having already secured his left-wing base, Zguyanov now desired to strengthen his support from nationalist groups. He began gesturing towards the nationalist opposition, meeting with most key figures and groups of Russia's nationalist opposition, with the exception of Vladimir Zhirinovsky Before, and early into, the campaign, Zyuganov persuaded nationalist figures such as former vice-president Alexander Rutskoy (a leading Peronist amongst nationalists), Sergei Baburin (an important nationalist figure in the Russian legislature, and leader of the Russian All-People's Union) and Stanislav Govorukhin to support his candidacy, convincing them that no patriotic alternative to his candidacy was available and that without partnership with the communists, it would be impossible for nationalists to have a candidate they supported win the presidential election. Zyuganov partnered with Ryzhkov to form the Bloc of National and Patriotic Forces (sometimes referred to as the \\"popular-patriotic bloc\\"), a coalition of nationalist and communist organizations. More than 70 separate organizations had joined by early April, and by the end of the election more than 136 organizations had joined. At his campaign stops, Zyuganov was mindful to emphasize that he considered himself to be, not the candidate of the Communist Party, but the candidate of a bloc of nationalist and socialist associations. The tide turns Zyuganov had originally benefited from the fact that the Communists' role in the legislature was far more moderate than many feared it would be. However, on March 15 the Communist Party acted in the State Duma to pass a largely symbolic non-binding resolution denouncing the Belavezha Accords. This was intended to be a purely symbolic measure, meaningless except to remind Russians of the assertion that Yeltsin had overridden the will of the people in breaking-up the Soviet Union. Soon after the resolution passed, Yeltsin attacked the communists, insinuating that, by declaring the Belavezha Accords to be illegal, the Communists were declaring Russia itself to be an illegitimate state. Yeltsin condemned the resolution as being both scandalous and unconstitutional. Yeltsin declared, \\"I will allow no attempts to undermine Russian statehood and destabilize the country.\\" In actuality, the passage of the resolution had played right into Yeltsin's trap. Yeltsin's aides had allegedly laid the groundwork for the vote to succeed by giving nationalists in the Duma the go-ahead to vote with the Communists and by coordinating the proceedings so that only Yeltsin's least persuasive allies in parliament spoke out against the resolution. It became clear that what had originally been meant as an inconsequential and purely symbolic resolution had acquired some very real ramifications. The resolution positioned Zyuganov as an extremist per the perception of the Russian Public. Soon after the resolution passed, polling showed it to be highly unpopular, with less than a third of Russians approving of it. The Communist Party failed to effectively respond to the backlash. In fact, during the campaign, the deputy chairman of the Communist Party might have worsened the damage by declaring, \\"The death of communism never happened...the Soviet Union never collapsed, people still think of themselves as Soviets.\\" In spite of this development, Zyuganov persisted in campaigning as he had before, traveling the country delivering many of long, often pessimistic, stump speeches. However, this was to little avail, as Yeltsin's numbers rose while Zyuganov's fell. In fact, by April, a number of polls showed Yeltsin leading Zyuganov for the first time.CNN - Yeltsin leads election poll - April 22, 1996 However, with Zyuganov still leading in numerous other polls, Communists continued operating under the assumption that Zyuganov was still the favorite to win. By May, Yeltsin's position in the polls had universally evened-out with Zyuganov's. Quite consequentially, polling also showed that the electorate no longer trusted Zyuganov to be any more successful in dealing with the conflict in Chechnya that Yeltsin. The highly unpopular Chechen War had once been thought to be the issue that would guarantee Yeltsin's loss in the election. This was no longer the case. Both Zyuganov and Yeltsin maintained busy campaign travel schedules. While Yeltsin's campaign schedule included visits to areas with electorates that were regarded to be strongly communist, Zyuganov largely avoided campaigning before hostile or ambivalent audiences. While he did manage to make a handful of trips to areas that had weaker communist support, Zyuganov largely held rallies with audiences that were predominately composed of enthusiastic supporters rather than speaking to undecided voters. End of the first round In the run-up to the first round of voting, rallies were held by communist supporters. This included a rally held by Viktor Anpilov in Moscow's Lubyanka Square. Zyuganov placed second behind Yeltsin, and advanced to the second round of election. Campaigning (second round) In the second round of the election, Zyuganov struggled to organize a coalition of support to defeat Yeltsin. Since, in the first round, Zyuganov had failed to capture a greater percentage of the vote than the Communist Party had captured in the 1995 legislative elections, it became apparent that he needed to widen his appeal. He sought to form allegiances with candidates that were eliminated after the first round. However, his hopes failed to materialize, as many of those candidates quickly gave their support to Yeltsin. With limited resources, and a very brief campaign period, Zyuganov's team urged him to soften his image with sentimental television commercials. However, Zyuganov was reluctant to film commercials that were pitched to him. Zyuganov's team also urged him to focus on issues while minimizing his mentions of Communist ideology (which was off-putting to many voters). Trailing Yeltsin, and with very little time to overcome this deficit, Zyuganov all but resigned to the likelihood that he would lose to Yeltsin. He refused to commit the persistent energy and effort he would have been necessary for him to stand a chance of winning the runoff. Rather than making any significant effort to shake-up the race in the period between the first and second rounds, Zyuganov stayed the course by continuing with the campaign style that he had used (and fallen short with) in the first round. This approach had been criticized for being relatively inactive, unexciting, and antiquated. Outcome Zyuganov was handed a decisive defeat in the election, losing to Yeltsin by nearly ten million votes. =Concession= On the night of the election, after being defeated, Zyuganov held a press conference. He expressed his displeasure over what he proclaimed to have been the \\"crude\\" inequities and ruinous price\\" of the presidential campaign. However he also, with visible emotion, conceded the election to Yeltsin, congratulating him on his victory. He ruled out the possibility that he would orchestrate any street protests to challenge the results of the election. Zyuganov, finding a positive spin on his defeat, declared that the election demonstrated a two-party political system was emerging in Russia and that the political might of the Communist-led campaign alliance could no longer be ignored by the Yeltsin administration. =Red Belt= Federal subjects which Zyuganov won in the second round of voting are colored in red. The election map reflected the existence of the so-called Red Belt. Russia's poorest populace lived in countryside of the nation's south, whilst its wealthiest lived in the northern urban areas. Thus, the southern regions of the nation were more willing to vote in support of the communist opposition. Polling had shown Zyuganov to have his greatest support amongst both poorer and rural Russians. Policy positions Zyuganov's rhetoric was widely considered to be nationalist. Rather than moving to the center and appealing to a broader demographic, Zyuganov delivered speeches in his campaign that outlined a platform which appealed to faithful communist supporters. However, portions of his campaign's official platform were more \\"moderate leftist\\" than pure communist. Zyuganov was generally regarded as conservative in the sense that he favored preserving/restoring much of Russia's traditional communist governance. Zyuganov's anti-reform and pro- communist stances offered a contrast against Yeltsin's pro-reform and anti- communist stances. He was seen as offering a nationalist opposition to Yeltsin. While Yelstin was seen to bolster the causes of centrists, Zyuganov was seen to champion the causes of nationalists. Use of media Zyuganov took advantage of the free air time his campaign received in order to air monologues, videos and footage of large Communist rallies he held before packed halls. The Communist Party could not afford to buy extra airtime, and thus were largely unable to run television advertisements. News coverage of Zyuganov was negatively biased, as Russian media oligarchs heavily favored Yeltsin's candidacy.Daniel Treisman, \\"Blaming Russia First\\", Foreign Affairs, November/December 2000. See, e.g., The media painted a picture of a fateful choice for Russia, a choice between Yeltsin and a \\"return to totalitarianism.\\" The oligarchs even played up the threat of civil war if a Communist were elected president.–ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å-–±–æ–µ—Ü // The New York Times, 30 –∞–ø—Ä–µ–ª—è 2007 One weakness of Zyuganov's campaign operation was its that it weakly marketed his candidacy, largely failing to promote it with appealing slogans. In May, in response to bias by the media, the Communist Party declared they would not spend campaign funds on advertising in national media, and would instead focus on advertising in regional press outlets and on funding door-to-door leafleting.

It includes every known recording from the tour, including audience tapes. Most of the set was unreleased at that point and some tapes never circulated before. Background The 1966 Live Recordings was released as a way to prevent the recordings from legally entering the public domain in Europe, in a similar fashion to The 50th Anniversary Collection (1962), The 50th Anniversary Collection 1963, and The 50th Anniversary Collection 1964. Studio sessions from 1965 and 1966 were released as part of The Bootleg Series Vol. 12 (with the live recordings from 1965 offered as digital download for the purchasers of the Collector's Edition). Promotion The set was announced on September 27, 2016, the track \\"Tell Me, Momma\\" was uploaded the next day on YouTube for promotion, and the release was supported by a 12-minute documentary. 'The Untold Story Behind The Recordings' finally gave full recognition to the pioneering work of Richard Alderson, who recorded the European concerts; most of the concert filming was, moreover, done by Howard Alk, with only a few concerts partially filmed by D.A. Pennebaker. Other releases The concert from Manchester (Discs 19 and 20) was already released in 1998 as part of The Bootleg Series Vol. 4. A concert from the boxset (London, 26 May 1966 - Discs 28 and 29) was released separately in November 2016 under the title The Real Royal Albert Hall 1966 Concert. Additionally, the 13 April 1966 show in Sydney (discs 1 and 2) was released as an Australian only, limited edition double LP under the title Live in Sydney 1966. Reception The 1966 Live Recordings currently maintains a 93% positive (\\"Universal acclaim\\") rating at Metacritic. Jesse Jarnow from Pitchfork said \\"A classic tour from start to finish, the set‚Äôs only drawbacks owe more to the format than the music\\", praising the great performances but insisting on the repetition of the same setlist, though noting that the repetitive setlists could be seen as a \\"feature, not a bug.\\" Track listing All songs written by Bob Dylan except \\"Baby, Let Me Follow You Down\\".

Humpback whales belong to the parvorder baleen whales, which are carnivorous, seasonal feeders.  Mouth  The baleen, a sieve-like structure in the upper jaw made of keratin, is used to filter plankton, among other food sources, from the water. Ventral grooves are expandable concave furrows that line a whale's throat and have the peculiarity of stretching like an accordion. They allow whales to open their mandible to 90 degrees to gulp water and prey. They expel saltwater through the baleen plates, leaving behind krill and plankton. The whale's tongue plays a vital role in filter feeding, as it is used to push the water out of its mouth while keeping the prey trapped in its baleen bristles. As humpback whales do not have teeth, their food is swallowed whole and travels down the esophagus into the preliminary stomach (known as the forestomach) to be ground.  Compartmentalized stomach  Baleen whales have a multi-chambered stomach, divided into three distinct compartments with separate functions ‚Äì the first being the forestomach. The role of the forestomach is a disputed topic. The forestomach of humpback whales is highly distensible and functions as a holding chamber for quantities of ingested food, which is of importance in animals that feed opportunistically. An extensive muscularis externa indicates that it also grinds or churns the contents mechanically to compensate for the whales‚Äô lack of teeth. According to the American Society for Microbiology, \\"the fore stomach consists of ‚Ä¶ non glandular tissue and appears to be analogous to the tissue of the rumen.\\" The forestomach is lined with a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium which is continuous of the oesophagus epithelium. Due to the reflux of stomach juices from the main stomach, minor digestive activity takes place in the forestomach. The main stomach, also referred to as the fundic stomach, secretes mucus, protein digesting enzymes and hydrochloric acid to aid the breakdown of food and lined. The stomach lining is reddish‚Äìpurple, highly convoluted and sometimes trabeculate epithelium. The pyloric stomach secretes enzymes that digest fat as well as alkaline chemicals to neutralize the stomach acid. It is the combined actions of these different compartments that allow whales to digest the chitin in the exoskeletons of krill and prey swallowed whole.  Duodenal ampulla/ duodenum  The duodenal ampulla can be described as the atrium of the small intestine and is a dilated sac forming the beginning of the duodenum. The duodenum prepares many nutrients from the digested matter (chyme), for absorption, which takes place in the intestines, and is the principal site for iron absorption.

He is C. J. MacCurdy Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University.  Education and career  Hole studied at Cornell College (BA, 1953), Harvard University (1957‚Äì58), and the University of Chicago (MA, 1958; PhD, 1961). He worked at Rice University from 1961 to 1980, and was a full professor from 1968. In 1980, he moved to Yale University, where he served as the C. J. MacCurdy Professor of Anthropology (1996‚Äì2005) and the Head of the Division of Anthropology at the Peabody Museum (1996‚Äì2005). He retired in 2005 and was appointed a Senior Research Scientist and professor emeritus. He has held visiting professorships at the University of Colorado (1971), Yale (1972‚Äì1973), and Masaryk University. Hole was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1966, a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1981, and a member of the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering in 1983. He received the 2007 lifetime achievement award from the Society for American Archaeology, and a Farabi International Award in 2011.  Research on Iranian prehistory  At Chicago, Hole studied under Robert Braidwood, who was investigating the origins of food production in Southwest Asia. In 1959, when political instability prevented him from returning to his excavations at Jarmo in Iraqi Kurdistan, Braidwood began working across the border in the Iranian part of the Zagros Mountains. Hole joined Braidwood's team, which in 1959 conducted the first systematic surveys of early prehistory in Iran, in the region of Kermanshah, and the following year conducted excavations at Asiab, Sarab, and Warwasi. After this Braidwood moved on to southeastern Turkey, but Hole and another of his students, Kent Flannery, returned to work in western Iran. Between 1961 and 1965, Hole and Flannery conducted a number of surveys in Lurestan and Khuzestan, and excavated at Gar Arjeneh, Yafteh, Pasangar, Ghamari, Kunji Cave, Ali Kosh, and (with James Neely) Tepe Sabz. These sites produced what was, at the time, some of the earliest evidence for the plant and animal domestication in the world. He is also known for his pioneering work on the archaeology of pastoral nomads in the Near East, in particular his ethnoarchaeology of Luri pastoralists in western Iran.

In general, economy of Azerbaijan, besides field-wise classification, can be divided into three categories: 1. recession period, covering 1992‚Äì1995, right after Azerbaijan restored its independence after the USSR collapsed, 2. recovery, from 1996 to 1997, mainly because of increased oil sales, potential oil contracts, partners, and pipelines, 3. boom, from 1998 till 2008, and finally, an economic fall, starting from 2009.  General  After Azerbaijan became independent following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the country started to pursue its sovereign economic policy. For a newly independent country with the economy mainly based on oil and gas industry, it was quite demanding to keep its say in the world of economy giants. The key objectives of the new and independent economic policy were establishment of the economic system built on the principles of several types of property, including private property, unlike the Soviet times, integration into the global economy and transition to market economy. Following the independence, the diverse economy of Azerbaijan started to collapse. During the first five years of independence, GDP per capita was only a little more than one third of what it was in 1989. With the poverty rate hitting 49% as of 2001 Azerbaijan started to engage in making progress in economic situation, and by 2013, GNI per capita rose up to $7.350 with $7.912 GDP per capita and only 5% unemployment rate. The following years from 2003 till 2009 are characterized to be the boom years due to the oil exports at high prices. Since the economy of Azerbaijan, is oil-based one, meaning the main revenues are from oil exports, the fall in petroleum prices since 2010 has made a huge impact on overall economy. This, however, has positive sides to it as well. The fall in GDP and overall economy itself, has made the government realize the urgency of the diversification of the industry. If, for example, the revenues from oil exports accounted for 42% of value added GDP, and 90.7% of total gross exports, in 2015, this number was only 34.3%. As a result of reforms mainly involving institutional changes implemented recent years, business environment in Azerbaijan improved and the country ranked 25th among 190 countries in the Doing Business report 2019 of World Bank.  Oil industry   History  The history of the oil industry in Azerbaijan dates back to 1847, when the first oil well was drilled using a primitive percussion drilling mechanism, eleven years prior to the first oil well rilled in the US, Pennsylvania. Baku became a hub for world-scale industrial investment towards the end of the 19th century. During the Soviet period, Baku oil was the main source for WWII and for other industries, providing 75% of the whole consumption. Oil tankers were filled and transported to their destinations through the Caspian Sea, which no doubt, had a vital role in WWII. However, wide-scale exploitation of the oil reserves for industrial reasons came only in the late 20th century. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the oil production dropped dramatically mainly because of the conflict over Nagorno Karabakh with Armenia, out-of-date equipment and machinery. As a result of the successful oil and gas strategy implemented by the government, the fall of the oil industry was followed by a number of fruitful oil contracts. With the \\"Contract of the Century‚Äù signed in 1994, and the deal on Shah Deniz gas field in 1996 initiated an exceptional amount of international investment flowing into the oil-gas sector. $60 billion foreign investment flew into the oil and gas sector of Azerbaijan from 1994 to 2010. While the oil and gas revenues were anticipated to reach $200 billion by 2024, with the current economic crisis, oil prices, and the devaluation of manat (currency of Azerbaijan), the expectations seem to be difficult to implement.  Oil strategy plan  As mentioned above, during the first years of independence when the new oil reservoirs were uncovered, foreign companies were interested in signing contracts to their benefit. In fact, almost all of them were not in favor of Azerbaijani people. In 1993, with the return of Heydar Aliyev to power, the talks that were going on since 1980s resumed and finally after long talks and negotiations Azerbaijan agreed to the terms of oil exploitation that actually reflected the nation's interests. The biggest oil contract signed in Gulustan palace in Baku with the Western companies on September 20, 1994 was a turning point in the history of oil industry of Azerbaijan. One of the key objectives of the oil strategy was to establish petro-chemical and oil refineries, the building block of the national economy which were founded not long after the ‚ÄúContract of the Century‚Äù.  Economic reforms   Price liberalization  First economic reforms started in the early stage of independence, namely 1991‚Äì1993 with the liberalization of price policy and foreign economic activities. About 70‚Äì80% of consumer and producer prices were already deregulated by January, 1992 following further price liberalization rounds in April, September, and December in the same year. The price liberalization resulted in sudden inflation in living expenses, important consumer goods and commodities. Official records show that average living expenses surpassed average income by approximately 50%. # The price of consumer goods increased in 1991 by 2.07 times against figures of 1990, and was growing in several times every year (10.12% times in 1992, 12.3 times in 1993, 17.63 times in 1994). # By the end of 1993, it was reported that the minimum weekly wage would not even buy one loaf of bread and that hundreds of thousands of refugees in Azerbaijan \\"simply face starvation,\\" a situation that heightened social and political instability.  Privatization  Second most important step was the privatization law that was passed in January 1993 to support the exuberant small-scale private economy which was in a desperate need of legitimizing its business ventures and operations. The policy was designed to encourage privatization of small bulk-sale business establishments, as well as large-scale and medium companies by auctions and joint stock procedures. Retail businesses were planned to be fully privatized by the end of 199, although the process prolonged. Privatization of housing was planned to be implemented by transferring the property ownership to the current residences.  Budget  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan, as all the other post-Soviet countries, started to experience the burden of losing government subsidies. So in an effort to aid the budget the government introduced excise taxes and value-added tax (VAT) as alternatives to sales and turnover taxes in early 1992. The main sources of the budget deficit were from pay rises (increases in wages) and from military and social expenses related to the conflict in Nagorno Karabakh, mainly its defense and increasing refugee expenses. Large increases in defense and wartime expenditures (from 1.3 percent of GDP in 1991 to 7.6 percent in 1992) considerably reduced expenditures for government subsidies for consumer goods, especially in bread and fuels, as well as government investment and supplementary funding for organizations. Increasing wages of civil servants was one of the reasons of the budget deficit in 1992. Azerbaijan introduced manat - its own currency in mid-1992. In 1994 the currency was classified as a ‚Äúsoft currency‚Äù and therefore non-convertible at that time.  Banking  During the Soviet period and the period following its collapse, Azerbaijani banks were still dependent on Russian banks in terms of funding. Bank funds were spread in accordance with a single state plan, and government banks had little contribution when it came to the raising or allocation of funds. National Bank of Azerbaijan (NBA) was established in early 1992, with former Soviet banks, namely State Bank, the former USSR Industrial-Construction Bank, Azerbaijani bank of Agro- Industrial Bank of the USSR ‚Äì being incorporated into the NBA. The name was then changed into Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan with the referendum act on March 18, 2009. NBA became one of the top level authorities in the new banking system and among the commercial banks (both state- and privately owned) with the Law on Banks and Banking Activity and the Law on the National Bank adopted in 1992. The Central Bank of Azerbaijan is the mere authority regulating the private and state-owned banks and funds at present.

He founded a successful financial PR firm which merged with a Bell Pottinger company in 2010. Henderson subsequently became chief executive of the Bell Pottinger group, but was forced to resign in 2017 over a scandal relating to its work for a South African client and which also led to the company going into administration (bankruptcy), with the company's administrator later considering lawsuits against Henderson and other former Bell Pottinger partners. In January 2018, he founded J&H; Communications Ltd. Early career Born in S√£o Paulo, the son of a Brazilian mother and English father, Henderson grew up in London's Kensington and attended Haileybury and Imperial Service College. He studied law at the University of Buckingham and then worked briefly for a London stockbroker before joining corporate PR firm College Hill (today, Instinctif) in December 1989 ‚Äì first as a researcher, later as a PR executive ‚Äì where he spent 14 years (not 12 years as one source suggests), leaving in August 2004. Henderson then founded a financial PR consultancy, Pelham Public Relations, in November 2004, growing it to a 40-strong, ¬£6m business before approaching Bell Pottinger Corporate and Financial to bring about a merger in 2010. In the first half of 2011, the company was ranked 14th amongst global, and 8th amongst UK, M&A; public relations advisers by Mergermarket, the Financial Times-owned mergers and acquisitions data company. The company's M&A; work included acting for Northumbrian Water Group in its agreed acquisition by Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings, for Richemont in its acquisition of Net a Porter, Qatar Investment Authority in its acquisition of Harrods and for Universal Music in its acquisition of EMI Recorded Music. In 2012 Henderson supported Lord Bell in a ¬£20.5m management buy-out of Bell Pottinger from Chime Communications (the total deal value was ¬£26.5m including an ancillary transaction to acquire the Pelham shareholding), with Henderson, holding a 25% equity stake, subsequently appointed group chief executive.See article Talk page regarding email exchange with James Henderson. Bell Pottinger As chief executive of Bell Pottinger, Henderson had to defend the company against criticisms in 2011 of its Whitehall lobbying activities, while conceding the firm was at fault for editing Wikipedia entries (activity which pre-dated his time as CEO). In 2016, Bell Pottinger was again reported to have manipulated Wikipedia and other social media, on behalf of clients in South Africa, notably the Gupta family-owned Oakbay Investments. In March 2017, it was alleged that Bell Pottinger was behind a social media campaign, using fake bloggers, commentators and Twitter users to influence public opinion and sow racial division in South Africa, as well as targeting media and personalities that were opposed to the Gupta family. On 30 June 2017, Bell Pottinger announced that it was hiring Herbert Smith Freehills to review its dealing with Oakbay Investments. On 6 July 2017 Henderson issued an apology and announced that the firm had \\"dismissed the lead partner involved [in the Oakbay portfolio] and suspended another partner and two employees so that [they] can determine their precise role in what took place.\\" However, following a complaint from South Africa's Democratic Alliance, the UK's Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA) held a disciplinary hearing and on 4 September 2017 announced Bell Pottinger's expulsion. In the meantime, it emerged that Henderson had resigned just days before. Henderson said: :\\"I recognise the business requires a change of leadership to fix the problems of the past and to move forward. Although I neither initiated nor was involved in the Oakbay work, I accept that as CEO, I have ultimate executive responsibility for Bell Pottinger. I feel deeply let down by the colleagues who misled me. However, I think it is important I take proper accountability for what has happened.\\" By this stage, Bell Pottinger had appointed accountancy firm BDO to find a buyer, but the company went into administration on 12 September 2017, shedding all its staff by the end of November 2017. Several employees questioned Henderson's management skills and suggested he became distracted by his then relationship with Heather Kerzner, 48, the ex- wife of the South African casino mogul Sol Kerzner and a friend of Sarah, Duchess of York. A former colleague claimed: \\"It all went to his head. If he saw a picture of himself [in the paper] he was delighted.\\" Henderson could yet be liable for the agency's actions. Shareholders were reported to be considering legal action against former Bell Pottinger directors for not disclosing the scale of the problem in South Africa, claiming that this non- disclosure affected their participation in a share buy-back in early 2017. Administrator BDO was reported to be pursuing around 40 former Bell Pottinger partners to repay around ¬£4m, with Henderson asked to repay ¬£400,000. In April 2019, BDO said it could bring lawsuits against former Bell Pottinger partners for their involvement in work for Oakbay, which breached partnership agreements. In October 2019, while 21 former Bell Pottinger partners had repaid ¬£468,000, Henderson was reported to be disputing the amount requested by BDO. In November 2019, the Financial Times reported Henderson was prepared to pay a \\"materially lower\\" amount. In July 2020, it was reported that Henderson and other former Bell Pottinger partners faced potential disqualification from acting as company directors by the Insolvency Service under provisions of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. After Bell Pottinger In December 2017, it was reported that Henderson was \\"working for four or five clients\\" and planned to launch a new business in 2018. In January 2018, J&H; Communications Ltd (incorporated on 7 December 2017) was reported to be working for the prime minister of Turkey, and later for property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz. Henderson told PRWeek J&H; would concentrate on \\"corporate, financial, brand, regulatory and reputation management\\" work. Personal life Henderson married Alexandra Fisher in 1991. They divorced in 2017. In the divorce settlement he lost his Clapham house, while the rest of his estimated ¬£7m personal wealth was said to have been invested in Bell Pottinger. Henderson was engaged to Heather Kerzner. She bought a 15% stake in Bell Pottinger shortly before the South African scandal erupted. Between them, Henderson and Kerzner jointly owned 37% of Bell Pottinger. On 9 September 2017, it was reported that their November wedding had been postponed. Shortly after, Kerzner was reported to have hired lawyers Grosvenor Law to investigate how to regain some of her Bell Pottinger investment, despite such holdings being effectively worthless as the administrators would prioritise banks and other creditors ahead of equity shareholders. In December 2017, Kerzner took a stake of just under 50% in J&H;, Henderson's new firm, but in April 2019 relinquished her significant shareholding. Henderson's son Felix founded a student flat-finding hub called Bubble Student, part-funded by a loan from his father. In November 2019, the business had reportedly run out of money and been mothballed. Henderson was a Trustee of Children in Crisis and is a past member of Brooks's club.

He published several important researched and monographs on the origin of Kurds based on the Arabic sources. Poladian received his PhD in History from the National Academy of Sciences of Armenia in 1984. He also received a State Doctorate in Historical Sciences from the same Academy in 1996. He has worked at many scientific and educational centers from 1967 to 2000, and held various positions, most notably as Professor of Arabic studies at Yerevan State University; Scientific Researcher at the St. Petersburg branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences; and Scientific Researcher at the Institute of Oriental Studies. Among Arshak's most important studies are, \\"Kurds in Arabic Sources,\\" Yerevan (in Russian), 1987; \\"Kurds,\\" Ankara (in Turkish), 1991; \\"Studies in the History and Culture of the East,\\" Abu Dhabi, 2001; \\"History of Arab-Armenian Relations,\\" Abu Dhabi, 2002; and \\"Islam: Religion & State,\\" Abu Dhabi, 2003. One of the most important work in this domain has been published by the ECSSR /‚ÄúEmirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research‚Äù/ under the title: ‚ÄúThe Origin of the Kurds in Arabic Sources‚Äù (Abu Dhabi, 2004, in Arabic, about 100 pages). The book is based on a previous publication by the author on the same subject with slight additions and modifications (see \\"Kurds in Arabic Sources\\", Yerevan 1987, published in Russian by the Institute of Oriental Studies, Academy of Sciences of Soviet Armenia; translated into Arabic by Dr. Khatchadour Kasbarian and Abdul Karim Aba Zid, date and place of translation unknown). Parts of the above research could also be found in an earlier book of Poladian, published by the now closed ‚ÄúZayed International Center for Coordination and Follow-up‚Äù (see ‚ÄúStudies in the History and Culture of the East\\", Abu Dhabi, 2001). Examining the origin of the Kurds in accordance with Arabic sources addresses an important facet of Arab-Kurdish relations - it hasn't received sufficient attention from historians and hasn't been explored the way in which it ought to be. Investigating this issue is critical, especially in attempting to understand the contemporary Kurdish situation, current geopolitical developments, and the role of Kurds throughout the Middle and Near East. The story of the Arabic origin of the Kurds in particular has, according to the study, emerged amidst the Arab milieu. There is much evidence that lends basis to the assumption that the Diar Rabia itself was the cradle of their nascency, later spreading to other parts of the Caliphate territories The Kurds' acceptance of the assertion that they derive from Arab origin should come as no surprise, in light of the consideration that the claim would have ensured Kurdish princes converting to Islam reverence and prestige in some circles and accordingly, the extension of their sphere of influence. Other publications of Poladian, particularly relating to the Armenian-Arab relations, play a significant role in an enlightened quest for understanding and dialogue between Armenians and Arabs. Several important works in this domain were published In Damascus and Abu Dhabi under the titles ‚ÄúArmenia and the Arab world‚Äù Damascus, 2007; ‚ÄúEyewitnesses on Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire‚Äù (Arabic and Armenian), Damascus, 2015 and 2017; \\"History of Arab- Armenian Relations,\\" Abu Dhabi, 2002. In his works Poladian touches not only the cultural relations and dialogue between the nations, but he discusses also the Arab role in helping the Armenians during the Genocide and documenting events, which is very much understudied. Little has been said of the role played by Arabs in addressing the humanitarian disaster that ensued as hundreds of thousands of refugees and orphans streamed out of Anatolia.

He prepared musical settings of popular folklore by collaborating with well known Australian lyricists of his time, including Banjo Paterson, Henry Lawson and Mary Gilmore. He was a leading proponent of the Australian bush ballad as a vehicle for music education. In 1938, Alfred Hill composed a musical setting of Lavater's verse Mopoke. Lavater's words were also set by Australian composers Doctor Ruby Davis and Fanny Turbayne. Notoriety Lavater was regarded as a gifted leader of music in rural Victoria. He was fondly known for his direction of Liedertafel concerts held between 1890 and 1920. Several Photographs of Louis Lavater in circulation show him as literate or musical.

Sa Perola has become a historical landmark for the town of Calella de Palafrugell and is noteworthy in ethnological, social and cultural terms. Its relevance extends beyond the municipality of Palafrugell, due to the destruction of most of the net-dyeing houses on the Catalan Coast.  History  The Sa Perola building was most likely built at the end of the 18th century by the Fishermen's Association of Palafrugell. The building's facilities were used to dye cotton networks to ensure their preservation and as a meeting place for fishermen. The fisherman Joan Bofill i Codina (Calella de Palafrugell, 1816 - 1884) bought the house known as Sa Perola in 1865, when the sailors' union was disbanded. In 1868, he sold it to the Fisherman's Guild to be used communally. The use of Sa Perola was declining until the 1960s, due to the emergence of nylon, which did not require dye. In 1986, the Fishermen's Association donated the building of Sa Perola to the City of Palafrugell on the condition that it had public use. The ground floor became the tourist office of Calella de Palafrugell. In 2010, the Sa Perola Interpretation Center was inaugurated to promote the maritime and fishing heritage of Palafrugell. The purpose of the Sa Perola Interpretation Center is to preserve knowledge, information, and artifacts of the marine and fishing trade, including fishermen's houses, huts, and watchtowers.

He is co-chair of the GRADE Working Group, for which he coined the name GRADE and has played a major role in disseminating its spirit of collaboration, openness, the advancement of evidence assessment, and the creation of better health care recommendations. GRADE is an acronym for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. The result of the group‚Äôs efforts is a common, sensible, and transparent approach to grading the quality (or certainty) of evidence and grading the strength of healthcare recommendations ‚Äì this is called the GRADE approach. Sch√ºnemann‚Äôs work also focuses on the practical application of scientific evidence by researchers and clinicians, through co-inventing tools like the GRADEpro guideline development tool, and pioneering the use of GRADE Evidence to Decision tables, now reworked as GRADE Evidence to Decision Frameworks.

Concluded in the aftermath of the Battle of Ankara, while S√ºleyman tried to strengthen his own position in the succession struggle with his brothers, the treaty brought major concessions to the Christian states, especially the Byzantines, who regained lost territories and achieved a position of nominal superiority over the Ottoman ruler. Its provisions were honoured by S√ºleyman as well as by Mehmed I, the victor of the Ottoman succession struggle, but collapsed after Mehmed's death in 1421.  Background  On 26 July 1402, in the Battle of Ankara, the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I was defeated and captured by the Turco-Mongol warlord Timur. This momentous event overturned the balance of power in the region, as the Ottoman domains in Anatolia were divided by Timur, who restored many of the independent Turkish beyliks previously absorbed by Bayezid. Timur did not interfere with the Balkans, where the Ottoman conquest was also far advanced: before Ankara, Constantinople, almost the last remnant of the Byzantine Empire, was cut off and on the verge of falling to Bayezid. As in Anatolia, the sudden collapse of Ottoman power left a power vacuum, in which the various Christian powers of the region‚Äîthe Byzantines, the Hungarians, the Republic of Venice, and a number of minor rulers‚Äîeach tried to secure their interests as best possible, while being too weak to actually challenge Ottoman power. S√ºleyman √áelebi, the eldest son of Bayezid, escaped the disaster at Ankara and arrived at Gallipoli on 20 August. While his other brothers were left in Anatolia to deal with Timur and try to salvage what domains they could, S√ºleyman claimed control over the Ottoman territories in the Balkans (\\"Rumelia\\"). His position there was insecure, however, and his first priority was to contact the Christian powers of the region and arrange a truce with them, especially in view of the necessity to one day return to Anatolia and contend with his brothers and other rivals (cf. Ottoman Interregnum). Already on 22 September, the Venetian Senate was discussing the matter, and hoped to gain control over Gallipoli. The Venetians also contacted the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, who at the time was in Paris on a grand journey seeking help in the West, urging him to return home, since Manuel's nephew and regent, John VII Palaiologos, was known to sympathize with Venice's maritime and commercial rivals, the Republic of Genoa. Negotiations soon began, and S√ºleyman sent envoys both to Venice and Manuel, offering significant concessions. Manuel, however, would not return to Constantinople until 9 June 1403, and an agreement was reached during his absence, after negotiations lasting three and a half months. The Venetians, who among other concerns wanted to use Ottoman influence to settle their rivalry with the Florentine Antonio I Acciaioli, who had captured Athens, sent their most experienced diplomat, the lord of Andros, Pietro Zeno, as their negotiator, along with Marco Grimani, while Genoa named Jean de Chateaumorand as its envoy to the eastern potentates.  Provisions  Map of the southern Balkans and western Anatolia in 1410, during the latter phases of the Ottoman Interregnum. The territories of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans largely correspond to the provisions of the Treaty of Gallipoli Judging from the fact that on 20 February scribes from Pera were being paid for their work in drafting the treaty, the agreement was concluded in January or early February 1403. A single copy of it survives, a poor Venetian translation of the Turkish original. Pietro Zeno also left an account of the negotiations with the Ottomans, where he states that the treaty was signed at Gallipoli. The provisions of the treaty were as follows: # Sultan S√ºleyman concluded \\"true peace\\" with the \\"great emperor of the Greeks [John VII Palaiologos], my father\\", as well as with \\"the great communes of Rhodes [the Knights Hospitaller], Venice, Genoa with the isle of Chios and the Duke of Naxos and with all the lands and islands that are theirs and their possessions in the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea\\". # To the Byzantine emperor, Sultan S√ºleyman ceded \\"Thessalonica and Kalamaria with all their related territory\\", the coast from \\"Gallikos up to the river Paravardaro\\", as well as all the land from Panidos (on the Marmara Sea) up to Mesembria (on the Black Sea) and the region of Palateoria with all its fortresses. The Byzantines were no longer required to pay tribute, and were free to erect fortresses as they pleased. The contemporary Byzantine historian Doukas gives a slightly different account, recording that S√ºleyman handed over \\"the regions of the Strymon as far as Zetounion, the Peloponnese and the lands surrounding [Constantinople] from Panidos to the Hieron Stomion [i.e., the Bosporus], and all the coastal fortresses situated along the Black Sea from the Hieron Stomion to Varna\\". These passages have been interpreted as implying that S√ºleyman ceded control of all coastal territories from the Strymon river down to Zetounion (modern Lamia), i.e. the larger part of coastal Macedonia (including Chalcidice) and the coast of Thessaly down to the Maliac Gulf. It is impossible to say with certainty how far inland that control extended. # S√ºleyman further ceded \\"all the castles that the emperor had possessed in Turkey\\". The return of some fortresses on the coasts of Anatolia is confirmed by the Byzantine historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles, but no details are known from Byzantine sources. The identity of at least some of these castles is provided by the Ottoman historian Ashikpashazade, who reports that , Sultan Mehmed I recovered the forts of Hereke, Old Gebze, Darƒ±ca, Pendik and Kartal, on the northern shore of the Gulf of Nicomedia, which had been in Byzantine hands until then. However, Ashipashazade's phrasing also suggests that these fortresses remained contested with the Byzantines thereafter, and not until the reign of Mehmed II () were they definitely conquered by the Ottomans. # If Timur should attack Constantinople, S√ºleyman undertook to help defend it with his galleys and sailors. # S√ºleyman also returned the islands of the Northern Sporades: Skopelos, Skiathos, and Skyros. Their tribute was likewise annulled. # All citizens of Constantinople (i.e., of the Byzantine emperor) were allowed to return to their homes without any impositions. # All cases of litigation from the time of S√ºleyman's father and grandfather were dropped, except for cases of debts between individuals. # The Serbian ruler Stefan Lazareviƒá was to be allowed to retain his lands, on the condition that he accepted the same obligations owed to Bayezid, i.e. pay tribute and provide military assistance. # All Frankish, Venetian, Genoese, Rhodian, and Greek merchants were free to trade in any territory possessed by S√ºleyman then or in the future, and would be obliged to pay in duties \\"what was usual before\\". # If a merchant commits a crime, no other merchants should be punished other than the perpetrator. # If a shipwreck should occur in S√ºleyman's territory, both goods and passengers would be returned. # All ports under S√ºleyman's control would be open to Christian merchants, who would be allowed to export grain without restrictions. The tax on each bushel (mozo) of grain, of the weight used in Constantinople, was set at one hyperpyron. # S√ºleyman's ships would not be allowed to leave the Dardanelles without permission from the Byzantine emperor and the Christian league. # All Byzantine prisoners held by S√ºleyman or any of his subordinate lords were to be released. # All Genoese prisoners held by S√ºleyman or any of his subordinate lords were to be released. # If a Genoese slave were to escape to Ottoman territory, he would be returned. Any Muslim held by the Genoese after Timur's attack would be released. # Twenty-five prisoners from Chios (a Genoese colony) held by the Ottomans were to be released. # The Genoese colonies in the Black Sea were relieved of the tribute to the Ottomans. # The tribute of 500 ducats paid until then by Chios to the Ottoman governor at Alto Luogo (Ayasoluk) would cease. # All territories, forts, dwellings, and anything else taken from the Venetians was to be restored to them, and Athens to return to their rule. The latter provision was never actually enforced, and Antonio I Acciaioli retained control of Athens. # The Venetians received a strip of land, five miles wide, on the Greek mainland opposite the whole length of the island of Euboea (a Venetian possession), but the Ottomans were to retain the salt flats and ports in the area. The Venetians also undertook to punish anyone taking grain from Ottoman territory without paying customs duties. # S√ºleyman agreed not to increase the tribute levied on the Marquisate of Bodonitsa from what it was under Bayezid, although the marquis had conspired against the Ottomans in Thessaly. # Slaves from both sides seeking to escape in the territory of the other would be returned. # The tribute of 200 ducats paid until then by Naxos would cease. # S√ºleyman would return 500 Venetian prisoners, provided the Venetians released all Ottoman prisoners they held. # The tribute of 500 ducats paid until then by New Phocaea (a Genoese colony) would cease. # The transfer of the County of Salona to the Knights Hospitaller by the Despot of the Morea, Theodore I Palaiologos, was ratified.  Significance and aftermath  The treaty (or another treaty with similar provisions) was ratified anew once Emperor Manuel II returned from the West later in the year. The treaty was very unpopular with the Ottomans due to its concessions, but the need to keep his rear secure while engaged in the civil war of the Ottoman Interregnum with his brothers forced S√ºleyman to adhere to it until his own overthrow in 1411. Nevertheless, the opposition of the powerful Ottoman frontier warlords (uch bey), such as Evrenos Beg, may have resulted in at least one major omission from the treaty: Gallipoli itself remained in Ottoman hands, thereby averting the extremely disadvantageous position that had resulted from its temporary loss to the Savoyard crusade in 1366, when the Ottoman domains in Anatolia and Europe had been effectively sundered apart. The historian Nevra Necipoƒülu highlights the reference to the Byzantine emperor as \\"father\\" by S√ºleyman throughout the treaty, indicating the remarkable reversal of positions brought about by the Battle of Ankara: from tributary Ottoman vassals teetering at the verge of extinction, after Ankara the Byzantines gained a certain advantage over the Ottomans, and managed to retain it for several years through adroit use of diplomacy and switching support between the rival Ottoman princes. In 1411, S√ºleyman was overthrown and killed by his brother, Musa, who proceeded to capture most of the territories ceded to the Byzantines in Macedonia, Thessaly, and Thrace. However, after Musa was defeated by Mehmed I in 1413, bringing an end to the Ottoman civil war the new Sultan confirmed anew the provisions of the treaty of Gallipoli, and his position as \\"obedient son\\" of Emperor Manuel, and upheld them until his death in 1421. Following the rise of Murad II to the throne, and the ascendancy of Manuel's hawkish son John VIII Palaiologos, the friendly Byzantine‚ÄìOttoman relations ended: Murad launched a brief siege of Constantinople in 1422, and began a long blockade of Thessalonica, which forced the Byzantines to hand it over to Venice in 1423. In a peace treaty concluded in February 1424, the Byzantines lost again most of the territories gained at Gallipoli, and were once more reduced to the status of tributary vassals. On the Venetian side, following S√ºleyman's preoccupation with affairs in Anatolia from 1406 on, relations worsened, as the local frontier warlords were left free to act, while Venice too became entangled in a war of expansion against the local Christian ruler Bal≈°a III, an Ottoman vassal, in the western Balkans. Venice sent repeated embassies to S√ºleyman in 1406‚Äì1409 to little avail. During this period, the Venetians negotiated directly with Pasha Yiƒüit Bey, ruler of Skopje, as well as with S√ºleyman. Nevertheless, the Venetian ambassador Francesco Giustinian managed to conclude a treaty with S√ºleyman in 1409, and following the latter's downfall, a similar treaty, the Treaty of Selymbria, was concluded with Musa in September 1411.

She is the great granddaughter of Camille Pissarro.  Early Life in France  L√©lia Pissarro is the third and youngest child of the artist Hugues Claude Pissarro and his first wife Katia, an art dealer. Until the age of 11 L√©lia grew up in the care of her paternal grandparents Paul- √âmile Pissarro and his wife Yvonne in the small Calvados farming hamlet of Cl√©cy where she also lived with her brother Joachim Pissarro, an art historian. The middle sibling, Lionel Pissarro was raised in their parent's household. During this time Paul-√âmile taught her fundamental Impressionist and Post-Impressionist techniques that he had learned from his father Camille Pissarro as well as some of his older brothers who were also artists; Ludovic- Rodo Pissarro, Felix (Titi) Pissarro, Georges-Henri (Manzana) Pissarro and the eldest, Lucien Pissarro.  Career  L√©lia Pissarro sold a work from her first series to Wally Findlay, a New York art dealer at the age of four, since then her work has been regularly exhibited around the world. After returning to Paris to live with her parents L√©lia had her first exhibition at the Salon de la Jeune Peinture, subsequently taking part in an exhibition at the Luxembourg Museum in Paris. A year later she began her formal education at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Tours. With her parents dividing their time between France and California, L√©lia found herself moving between Tours, Paris and San Francisco. Whilst in Paris, L√©lia taught art at the Moria School and studied oil painting restoration under Madame de Pangalleria at the laboratory of the Louvre. She had solo exhibitions in Paris, Lyon, Mulhouse and Rennes. After moving to London in 1988 L√©lia participated in a series of exhibitions entitled Pissarro: The Four Generations. These exhibitions have been mounted in London, Tel Aviv, five major museums in Japan and the Museum of Art in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. L√©lia moved to London after marrying the art dealer David Stern in 1988 and Stern Pissarro Gallery was created. The gallery has evolved into an international art business offering a collection of Impressionist, Modern and Contemporary art and specialising in Camille Pissarro as well as his descendants who became artists. Situation in the heartland of the London art scene, the gallery occupies the Modernist Target House building designed by Rodney Gordon on St James Street in Mayfair. In 1999, L√©lia became one of the founders of the Sorteval Press, a group of artists dedicated to developing their skills and techniques in etching and printmaking. Their first exhibition took place at the Mall Gallery in London in December 1999.

It is monotypic, with a single species, Chiropsoides buitendijki. The most distinct species characteristics are the shape of the gastric saccules, the pedalial canals, and the unilateral pedalial branching.  Anatomy and morphology  As members of the phylum Cnidaria, C. buitendijki have flexible, tubule-shaped stinging cells called nematocysts that coil within a capsule structure and can be launched outward to deliver a sting to prey. Many jellyfish of the class Cubozoa have tubules that can be categorized as microbasic, meaning that the tubule is not longer than the capsule and thus does not need to coil up to fit inside. More specifically, C. buitendijki have tubules called mastigophores, meaning \\"whip-bearing\\". Most Cubozoans, including C. buitendijki, have p-mastigophores, meaning that the shaft and tubule differ noticeably in girth. This structure is believed to carry most of the venom within the entire nematocyst. The umbrella-shaped fleshy body of C. buitendijki has a smooth texture, and the species does not present with any nematocyst warts (freckles). The umbrella can reach about in diameter in adult specimens, and harbors the typical cuboid shape of other box jellyfish. The species also has six functional eyes.  Behavior  Most studies of C. buitendijki have focused on partial DNA sequencing, anatomical classification, and morphology studies. There is little known about the species‚Äô behavior and community interaction. Chiropsoides buitendijki has potent venom that can harm human skin. Several reported cases of human injury have been reported off the southern coast of Malaysia. The sting marks left by the species are very distinctive because of the unique shape of their nematocysts. Species identification is therefore important in treating jellyfish stings.  Classification  The similar species Chiropsoides quadrigatus may be the same species as C. buitendijki; this has been debated since some of the ‚Äúdistinct‚Äù features of C. quadrigatus too closely resemble those same ‚Äúdistinct‚Äù features found in C. buitendijki. Distinctive features are what identify a species as their own unique taxonomic group. If the features that distinguish each of these species are the same, then it is possible they are in fact one species. More sampling and necropsies are needed to make a clearer distinction.  Habitat  Chiropsoides buitendijki have been recorded in the Indo-Pacific, specifically sighted in India, Malaysia, and Indochina. They live in mangrove forests and other coastal ecosystems. A few sightings of the species have also been reported in the Philippines and Australia. The species closely resembles other species of box jelly, and its habitats have been found to coexist with other Chirodropidae, such as Chironex yamaguchii and Chironex fleckeri; it is quite possible that sightings in Australia and the Philippines have been misidentifications. The range of the species could also be an underestimation due to undersampling and a lack of scientific study of the species.  Threats  Chiropsoides buitendijki have been shown to experience blooms in coastal upwelling regions, especially after monsoon season when the nutrients in the water are well mixed and distributed. However, these blooms in the Indian Ocean bring large numbers of jellyfish to coastal waters, where they are susceptible to bycatch from large fishing vessels. The jellyfish are not typically eaten, so a majority of catch is discarded on board.

Personal life  Rhys lived in St. Nicholas parish in the Vale of Glamorgan. He is descended from the line of Caradog Freichfras, a supposed knight of the Round Table. Meurug served as Clerk of the Peace in Glamorgan, having been appointed by the earl of Pembroke. He is buried in Cowbridge church.  Literary works  Meurug wrote a book on the history of Glamorgan, entitled A Booke of Glamorganshire Antiquities, completed in 1578. Though the original volume was lost in the Hafod library fire in 1807, a copy made in the late 17th century can be found in the Queen's college, Oxford library, and a second copy is in the Cardiff public library. The book is written in English and concerns three areas: Glamorgan region's characteristics, division of the country by Norman knights and the original Welsh families, and Meurug's modern-day Glamorgan. However, a final missing manuscript is insinuated from citations within the two extant manuscripts, and only a portion of the description of Meurug's Glamorgan is available. This third part may be more substantially preserved in Edward Llwyd's manuscripts, written by Meurug c. 1584, though this is not certain. This section discusses rivers, houses of the landed gentry, parishes and the lands.  Notable connections  Meurug collaborated with the historian Sir Edward Stradling while writing his book. He is also known to Dafydd Benwyn and Sils ap Sion, who both sang elegies to Rhys Meurug.Cardiff MS. 2, 277, 344-6, Manuscript  References   External links  A Booke of Glamorganshires Antiquities by Rhys Meurug, 1578; published London, 1825 16th-century Welsh people 1586 deaths ","title":"Rhys Meurug"},{"id":"55147549","text":"Eduardo Le Monnier (born Edouard Stanislas Louis Le Monnier; September 30, 1873 in Paris ‚Äì February 14, 1931 in Buenos Aires) was a French architect recognized for his work in Brazil, Uruguay and mostly in Argentina. He studied at the National School of Decorative Arts in Paris and moved to Brazil in 1894. There he worked on different projects, such as the General Carneiro station in Belo Horizonte and was a professor at the School of Fine Arts in Curitiba. He arrived in Buenos Aires on November 1, 1896, there he developed most of its projects and concrete works. One of his first works there is the bakery La Burdalesa (Paran√° n¬∫ 861/9, year 1898, already demolished). In 1901 he revalidated his diploma in the University of Buenos Aires and entered the Central Society of Architects (SCA). In 1902 he finished the Artistic Ironworks Motteau, with remarkable art nouveau style (Avenida Juan de Garay no. 1272, demolished) and later the headquarters of the society of mutual savings La Bola de Nievein Buenos Aires and in Rosario, province of Santa Fe (Cordoba and Laprida streets, year 1906). He obtained the Municipal Prize for the Best Facade of 1903 for the residence he built for Bartolom√© Ginocchio in Lima Street No. 1642. Two years later he received the third prize for the fa√ßade of Felix Egusquiza's residence on Libertad Street No. 1394 and in 1907 presided over the SCA. Thanks to these recognitions, different aristocratic families hire him to make his large residences in the Barrio Norte. The most important of these is the Fern√°ndez Anchorena Palace, now home to the Apostolic Nunciature, on Avenida Alvear 1637, built between 1907 and 1909. Another house, smaller but also lavish, was built on Avenida de los Incas 3260, where it is still standing. In the second half of the 1920s, and until the crisis of 1929, there was a great rise of financial institutions in Argentina. All of them built large parent companies in downtown Buenos Aires, which ended up taking the role of financial city that conserves today. Le Monnier was in charge of the headquarters of the Uruguayan Argentine Bank (Avenida Roque S√°enz Pe√±a n¬∫ 501, year 1928) and the neighboring buildings of the Bencich brothers, owners of a construction company (Edificio Bencich, Av. Roque S√°enz Pe√±a 615 and Edificio Miguel Bencich , Av. Roque S√°enz Pe√±a n¬∫ 614/6). Eduardo Le Monnier also taught in the National Academy of Visual Arts and Architecture.

In 1948 he settled in America. His younger brother was tennis and badminton player Henri Pellizza. Allison Danzig of The New York Times said of Pierre Pellizza \\"Pellizza was a bulldog for tenacity. He showed a forehand that rivalled Petra's...and a backhand that excelled his countryman's\\". The best results of Pierre Pellizza's career came at Monte Carlo, where he won the title in 1939 and 1946 (beating Yvon Petra in both finals). Pellizza played Davis Cup from 1938 to 1947. At the French Championships, Pellizza reached the quarter finals in 1946 (where he lost to Tom Brown) and 1947 (where he beat 8th seed Enrique Morea before losing to Tom Brown). At Wimbledon his best performance was in 1946, when he reached the quarter finals (he came from 2 sets down to beat Dragutin Mitiƒá before losing to Jaroslav Drobny). At the U. S. Championships, Pellizza's best results were the last 16 in 1936 (where he lost to Bitsy Grant) and 1946 (where he lost an epic five set match to former champion Don McNeill). He turned professional in 1948. Like Paul F√©ret and Henri Cochet, Pellizza was reinstated as an amateur. He played the French Championships for the last time in 1957, when he lost in the first round to Andres Gimeno.

John Hull (by 1503 ‚Äì 10 or 16 September 1549), of Larkbeare, Exeter, Devon, was an English lawyer and politician. He was the MP for Exeter from 1539‚Äì1542 with William Hurst, and again in 1547‚Äì49 with Griffith Ameredith. At the time Exeter was one of the wealthiest cities in England, rivaling London. A friend and supporter of Oliver Cromwell, his main work was a bill and subsequent project to widen and dredge the river Exe. It is thought that he became a member of parliament for the purpose of securing an inheritance denied him by Sir John Paulet. Early life and family Hull was the son of John Hull of Larkbeare and his wife Joan n√©e Trickhay, daughter of Nicholas Trickhay. His father was a merchant, from a trading background, this would go on to shape John Hull's interest in projects associated with trade, notably his project to improve navigation on the river Exe. Hull trained to be a lawyer at Middle Temple, London. He married Joan French, a daughter of Walter French of Ottery St. Mary. Career and death He was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Exeter in 1539 and 1547, during the reign of Henry VIII. He was instrumental in a project to dredge and widen the river Exe, and organised other significant engineering projects. During the western rebellion, he was in charge of Exeter's defences and resisted the attackers, after the rebellion he was made a commissioner to collect tribute for repair to the city caused by the rebellion. At some point in his life he was a customs officer. He acted as a justice of the peace for Devon from 1543 until his sudden death in September 1549 and was buried in Exeter Cathedral. Shortly before his death he named his widow sole legatee of his estate.
