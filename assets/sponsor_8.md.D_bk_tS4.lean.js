Goldingham was also an architect and surveyor who headed the Madras Survey School which later grew into the Guindy Engineering College and then Anna University. Born in London in 1767, Goldingham was first in the service of William Petrie at his private observatory and then hired by astronomer-sailor Michael Topping as his assistant in 1788. John Goldingham succeeded Michael Topping as the Astronomer posted in Madras. Goldingham was put in charge of building an observatory in 1792, and later appointed as the Presidency Civil Engineer in 1800. Although a mathematician, he managed to learn both astronomy and engineering. He worked at around the same time as Colonel Lambton began the Trigonometrical Survey. From 1787 observations were made on the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites. Using the time taken for these, the longitudes were established. Goldingham estimated the Madras observatory at 18¬∞17'21\\" E and these were used for a while by the Trigonometrical Survey. Goldingham was succeeded by T. G. Taylor in 1831. Map of Madras in Goldingham's experiment to find the velocity of sound in 1823 On April 20, 1796, he married Maria Louisa Popham, niece of Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham, at St. Mary's in Fort St. George. They had two sons. In 1815 he married Ann Baxter and they had a son and two daughters. In 1802, Goldingham formulated the Madras time which was 5 hours and 21 minutes ahead of GMT thus establishing the closest precedent to Indian Standard Time adopted a century later in 1906. In 1800, he designed the Banqueting Hall (now Rajaji Hall), for which he was granted a commission of 15% on all bills. After the Board of Directors found that Goldingham had drawn 22,500 pagodas as commission on the 180,000 spent on the work till September 1801, the commission was suspended. He then returned to his work as Government Astronomer, in the course of which he published two volumes of observations: one of them contains his observations on the length of the pendulum, the velocity of sound, of meteorological phenomena, as well as determinations of the longitude of Madras, and a discussion of the longitudes of the three Presidencies. He retired back to England, where he died at Worcester, in July 1849. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society, the Royal Geographical Society, and the Royal Astronomical Society.

It is listed as data deficient on the IUCN Red List as little is known about its distribution and ecology. Up to the late 20th century, it was known from only around 30 zoological specimens in natural history museum collections. Characteristics The Pousargues's mongoose is brown with a grey belly and face. Its tail is bushy, and its front feet have strong claws. Its body length is between with a long tail.  Taxonomy  Original drawing of Dologale dybowskii associated with the species description In 1893, Eug√®ne de Pousargues first described the Pousargues's mongoose on the basis of zoological specimens collected in 1892 near the K√©mo River. The type locality corresponds to the former French garrison founded by the Dybowski Mission close to the settlement of Fort de Possel. It is named in honor of Jean Dybowski who collected the specimens. It was initially subordinated to the genus Crossarchus. It is the only species in the genus Dologale. A genetic study focused on Carnivora highlighted the Pousargues's mongoose to be the sister-species of the genus Helogale. Distribution and habitat The Pousargues's mongoose ranges from northern Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, Central African Republic to western Uganda. Mongooses sighted and recorded by a camera-trap in 2011 and 2012 in the Central African Republic were preliminarily identified as Pousargues's mongoose. In 2013, a group of Pousargues's mongooses was observed near Lake Albert in Uganda's Semliki Wildlife Reserve. In 2016, an individual was observed and photographed in Garamba National Park. Conservation Field research for the collection of basic data on its ecology is indispensable for designing adequate conservation measures.

It does not advocate modification, alteration or ‚Äòhot-rodding‚Äô. Its mission is to preserve the historical integrity of vehicles, ranging from the earliest electric, steam and internal combustion or gasoline engines to the period where legislation dictated emission controls and computers replaced the mechanical components of a car. History and profile Initially founded by Bill Cannon in 1976, the first issue was published in February 1977. The early issues have become true collector's items, sought by restorers to complete their library. For the past fifteen years, editor Neil Maken has maintained the original mission of Authentic Restoration - bringing the car or truck back to the condition which it was in when it first left the factory. Over the years a number of very well known and highly respected names in the automotive restoration hobby have contributed articles, thoughts and opinions to this journal. Thousands of articles, shop-hints, product and book reviews, short- cuts and vehicle analysis have appeared in the 525+ issues. Many of these back issues are still available from the original inventory. The magazine is based in Huntington Beach, California. Selected columns from Skinned Knuckles appear regularly in such publications as Vintage Truck magazine, The Pierce-Arrow Society newsletters, Old Cars Weekly and the Old Cars Weekly Guide to Restoration, and numerous antique-car club newsletters. From the beginning, and continuing today, Skinned Knuckles is available by subscription only, not on the newsstands. Many of the current subscribers are also original subscribers, priding themselves on owning complete libraries dating from Volume 1, Issue 1. Skinned Knuckles prides itself on the fact that it is not merely a ‚Äòpicture‚Äô magazine of pretty cars and trucks, but is specifically written for the collector interested in restoring a vehicle to its original condition. They are in the technical forefront of restoration and other subjects of a topical and timely nature. There is a carefully balanced mix between the traditional \\"antique\\" automobiles and trucks‚Äîpre-World War II‚Äîand the \\"newer\\" collectibles which are the center of interest to some of the younger, new-to-the-hobby collector.

It has been listed as \\"Least Concern\\" on the IUCN Red List, as it is not threatened and thought to be common. It has a long, slim body and there are different colour forms, a black or dark brown form in the southern part of its range, and a yellowish- or reddish-brown form in the north. This mongoose inhabits dry, rocky habitats and feeds on insects, scorpions and small vertebrates. Description The Angolan slender mongoose is a small, slender species with a long, well-furred tail. Males have a head-and-body length averaging with females smaller at , the tail in each case being about in length. The skull is moderately broad and the ears are neat and rounded. This mongoose has several different colour forms; most individuals are black or deep brown, but some individuals are reddish-brown to yellowish-orange, the underparts being yellowish-orange and the tapering tail being a similar colour but with a black tip. Distribution and habitat The Angolan slender mongoose is endemic to southern Africa, its range including southwestern Angola and northwestern Namibia. The animals in Namibia are dark brown or black, while those in Angola are mostly the pale morph. Where the two types abut, in the vicinity of the Cunene River, there are no intermediate colour forms. The natural habitat of this mongoose is kopjes, rocky outcrops and areas with large granite boulders, and the woodlands and slopes surrounding these features. Ecology This mongoose is diurnal and largely solitary, with a home range of up to containing several dens. The ranges often overlap with the neighbouring mongoose. The diet consists largely of insects, solifuges, scorpions, lizards, snakes, small birds and mammals. The mongoose is itself preyed on by larger predators such as the African hawk-eagle. Status The Angolan slender mongoose has a somewhat limited range, and though its population size has not been estimated, it seems to be common and no particular threats have been identified. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

Range and habitat The slender mongoose, with up to fifty subspecies, are found throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with the black mongoose of Angola and Namibia sometimes considered a separate species. They are adaptable and can live nearly anywhere in this wide range, but are most common in the savannah and semiarid plains. They are much rarer in densely forested areas and deserts. Description Slender mongoose in the Prague Zoo, Czech Republic As the name suggests, the slender mongoose has a lithe body of and a long tail of . Males weigh , while the smaller females weigh . The color of their fur varies widely between subspecies, from a dark reddish- brown to an orange red, grey, or even yellow, but these mongooses can be distinguished from other mongooses due to the prominent black or red tip on their tails. They also have silkier fur than the other African members of their family. Behavior The slender mongoose generally lives either alone or in pairs. It is primarily diurnal, although it is sometimes active on warm, moonlit nights. It doesn't seem to be territorial, but will nevertheless maintain stable home ranges that are often shared with members of related species. Indeed, the slender mongoose and these other species may even den together, as most of their relatives are nocturnal. Dens may be found anywhere sheltered from the elements: in crevices between rocks, in hollow logs, and the like. Reproduction A male's range will include the ranges of several females, and scent cues inform him when the female is in heat. The gestation period is believed to be 60 to 70 days, and most pregnancies result in one to three (usually two) young. The male does not help care for them. Unusually, for a solitary species, in the Kalahari the males are philopatric whereas the females disperse. This is thought to be due to the benefits of kin cooperation by males in defence of females. Feeding The slender mongoose is primarily carnivorous, though it is an opportunistic omnivore. Insects make up the bulk of its diet, but lizards, rodents, snakes, birds, amphibians, and the occasional fruit are eaten when available. It will also eat carrion and eggs. As befits the popular image of mongooses, the slender mongoose is capable of killing and subsequently eating venomous snakes, but such snakes do not constitute a significant portion of its diet. Slender mongooses are more adept at climbing trees than other mongooses, often hunting birds there. Conservation The slender mongoose has been targeted by extermination efforts in the past, due to its potential to be a rabies vector and the fact that it sometimes kills domestic poultry. These efforts have not been conspicuously successful, although some subspecies may be threatened. Overall, the slender mongoose is in no immediate danger of extinction, and the IUCN Red List evaluated it as least concern.

Accropode blocks are man-made unreinforced concrete objects designed to resist the action of waves on breakwaters and coastal structures. History Accropode (1981) The Accropode is a single-layer artificial armour unit developed by Sogreah in 1981. Accropode concrete armour units are applied in a single layer. Ecopode (1996) The Ecopode armour unit with a rock-like appearance was developed by Sogreah to enhance the natural appearance of concrete armourings above low water level. A patent application was filed in 1996. The color and type of rock-like appearance can be specified to match the surrounding landscape. Accropode II (2004) In 1999, Sogreah modified the original Accropode shape by chipping away excess materials and adding friction features in the form of small pyramids. A patent application was filed for this modified shape. In 2004 further modifications to the 1999 shape were made, resulting in the Accropode II. The shape modifications are intended to increase interlocking.

It was designed in 2001 with samples produced in 2003 with the eventual production of the KH2002 commencing in 2004. It is similar in appearance to the FAMAS and Steyr AUG assault rifles. Its improved version, released in 2009, was known as \\"Sama\\". History According to a Global Security Studies report, it was observed that Venezuela received 18,000 KH-2002s sold to them by Iran in 2007. In the same year, an investigation was carried out in Uruguay in an attempt to bring KH-2002s into the country through Venezuela, which was a violation of UN embargo rules against Iran, according to reports in the Washington Times. According to the article, all 18,000 rifles and 15,000 rounds of Iranian-made 5.56mm NATO ammunition were confiscated. In 2008, Iran had sent ten samples of the KH-2002 to Syria in order to compete for a potential contract with the Syrian Army against the AK-74M. Eight KH-2002s used in field tests jammed numerous times, leaving two of them in working condition. It has been suggested that production of the KH-2002 was discontinued in 2012 after DIO was unable to find customers willing to buy the assault rifle. Design The KH-2002 features a four-position fire selector lever which is situated toward the rear of the left side butt-stock behind magazine housing with the M16-type magazine release button on the right side of the magazine housing.The World's Assault Rifles by Johnson and Nelson, Page 714. The weapon is not entirely ambidextrous since the ejection port is located on the right side of the rifle. It uses STANAG magazines, though it usually uses 20 or 30-round magazines. The selector offers semi-automatic, fully automatic and three-round burst options, with the safety selection in the forward position.The World's Assault Rifles by Johnson and Nelson, Page 1291. It operates as a gas operated, rotating bolt-type rifle. The DIO promotes the KH-2002 as a \\"low- recoil, highly accurate, lightweight\\" weapon, with \\"modular construction for easy maintenance\\" and a rotating bolt locking mechanism, presumably designed to facilitate ambidextrous firing, protected under a carrying handle that contains the rear sight. The carrying handle can also be used to mount optical or night sights. The weight of the KH-2002 with the long barrel and an empty 30-round magazine is given as 3.7 kg. The weapon can also be fitted with an optional bipod and a bayonet. Field stripping the rifle is most likely based on the M16. The Sama-type rifle has improvements made over initial production models such as having a longer carry handle to accommodate longer optics or scopes. Other improvements include a foregrip extension below the barrel to better handle the rifle, two picatinny rails on the receiver were included and the bolt carrier design changed to fit the ejection port. According to an October 2013 report by SIPRI, it's suggested that China may have provided technical assistance to Iranian engineers in designing the rifle. Variants The variants consisted of the following: * Assault Rifle: Standard barrel based on the M16A1. * Carbine: Has a short barrel and no front sight. * DMR: Has a longer barrel. Users Failed Contracts * : DIO competed with the KH-2002 against the AK-74M, which failed due to numerous jamming incidents. * : A smuggling attempt was made by CAVIM and MODLEX (Ministry of Defence & Armed Forces Logistics of the Islamic Republic of Iran) officials in a bid to supply the Uruguayan military with new assault rifles to secure a potential contract, which failed.

Appearance  It is a small species (55‚Äì69 cm long, weight range 0.5 ‚Äì 1.0 kg). It is a dark grey colour with a darker tip of the tail. The legs are a darker grey than the rest of the body. It has a typical elongated mongoose body-shape. The ears are small and rounded and are situated on the sides of the head. The tail is long and bushy. The teeth show adaptations for both cutting and crushing.  Diet and behaviour  The Cape grey mongoose feeds mostly on insects and small rodents, but will also eat birds, small reptiles, amphibians, other invertebrates, and fruit. They have been known to eat carrion and garbage as well. It is predominantly insectivorous but also carnivorous. Insects and other arthropoda such as spiders are caught on the ground and then held down with the forefeet and eaten. Larger prey such as rodents are stalked and killed with a bite to the head. Large prey items are held down with the forefeet and then torn into bite size pieces with the teeth. Small rodents, in particular Otomys and Rhabdomys, are their most important dietary component. On occasion, immature hares or the young of small antelopes such as Cape grysbok may be attacked.  Distribution  Until a few decades ago, the species was thought to be endemic to the Cape Province, but it is now known to occur in much of the rest of South Africa and in the west, northwards to southern Angola. It is not yet clear how continuous the range is, nor how much of this wider presence is due to extension of its range. Its density in areas where the species is established, ranges from one mongoose per 60 hectares to one per two hectares.  Habitat  It inhabits macchia- type vegetation (fynbos), semi-desert scrub (Karoo), thicket and forest. However, it is not found in the grassland biome. Often they live in close association with man, often under the floors of outbuildings, and even live successfully on the fringe of suburbia. When habituated to human presence, they may tolerate close approach.  Behaviour  Cape gray mongoose, late adolescent, member of a family party, inspecting surroundings. The Cape grey mongoose is diurnal. When not breeding, it is solitary, but litter remains together in a family party at least until late adolescence. They live in overlapping home ranges of 5-68 ha, with the males having larger ranges than the females. However, it is not entirely clear whether this species is territorial or not, or whether it might be more social than generally believed. They are poor diggers so they utilize piles of rocks, crevices, deserted burrows and hollows in tree trunks for shelter when there is not sufficient bush cover. They are often spotted by humans when they cross roads.  Reproduction  Litters of 1 ‚Äì 3 young are born from August to December and are hidden in burrows, rock crevices or tree hollows. At birth, the pups are fully furred but their eyes and ears are closed, only opening after about a fortnight. The young remain in the breeding burrow until they are fully weaned, and leave when they are capable of independence.

Graham, Sr. (1900‚Äì1960) was an American organizational theorist and consultant known as a pioneer in the development and application of scientific management and industrial engineering techniques to the office and factory clerical work. He is recognized as the founder of paperwork simplification. [citation needed] He saw a growing need for improvement in information processing back in the 1940s (when the professional and clerical segments of the workforce were still in the minority).  Biography  Graham started his career in the insurance business. In the 1940s he was trained in work simplification by Allan H. Mogensen and Lillian Gilbreth, which had started at the 1944 Work Simplification Conferences at Lake Placid, where he participated in Mogensen's class. Graham also participated in the programs of the Work Simplification Round Tables at New York University, the spring Methods Conferences conducted by the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania and at UCLA‚Äôs Engineering and Management Course. MIT, Northwestern University, Cornell and Georgia are among other colleges that called upon Mr. Graham throughout his career. Graham organized and directed the Paperwork Simplification Conferences held at Madison, Wisconsin in the spring and fall, at the Seigniory Club, Quebec, Canada in the spring and at the University of Dayton, Ohio in the fall. He conducted many sold-out public training workshops between 1953 and 1959 along with numerous in-house workshops for organizations in the US, Canada, and South America. He also conducted hundreds of speaking engagements to professional societies. Ben S. Graham, Sr. died in 1960 at the age of 59.  Work  Graham had adapted the Gilbreth flow process charts that were being used to improve factory work for use with more complex business processes. He was working with the Standard Register Company of Dayton, Ohio. His purpose was to display processes so that employee teams could study them and streamline them. Graham was invited to join Mogensen‚Äôs staff to provide instruction in paperwork simplification at Mogensen‚Äôs Work Simplification Conferences. Graham was a prolific author with articles on Work Simplification and Management Methods, particularly as applied to office and paperwork, that appeared in Fortune, Industrial Engineering Magazine and a great variety of professional and other journals here and abroad. Standard Register published a collection of his articles that appeared in their PS magazine called Paperwork Simplification for Better Management Control.

Boyd was a backing vocalist for MC Hammer in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and recorded for his Bust-It Records label, releasing a charting album and single of her own with the label in 1991. Subsequent releases were less commercially successful, but Boyd continued occasionally releasing music in the 2000s and 2010s. Allmusic credits Boyd with exploring neo soul musical aesthetics within urban contemporary music and described her as a forerunner to other African-American female soul singers, such as Mary J. Blige, Erykah Badu, and Jill Scott. Career and personal life Boyd was born and raised in the small rural town of Morton, Mississippi. She grew up singing and honing her vocals in a local church. She graduated from Morton High School in the Scott County School District in 1984. A few years later, she and her best friend made a decision to move out west to pursue a singing/music career together. The friend ended up getting pregnant and Boyd relocated to Oakland, California alone. It was not long after this relocation, that Boyd was discovered by producer (and future husband) James Earley and brought to MC Hammer's attention that Angie was a vocalist. Hammer is also the one credited with giving Boyd her stage name B Angie B when one day Hammer spoke the words \\"just be Angie\\". She sang on \\"Pump It Up (Here's the News)\\" on Hammer's Let's Get It Started album (the version re-released on Capitol Records in 1988) and she became a backup singer during his concert tours. During this tour, she briefly dated Mike Tyson. Her next opportunity came in 1989 with Hammer's all female rap group Oaktown's 3.5.7. She added her vocals to the rap song \\"Juicy Gotcha Krazy\\" and appeared in the video along with Oaktown's 3.5.7. She continued to tour and produce background vocals for Hammer during his successful Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em album and tour cycle in 1990. In 1991, Hammer signed B Angie B to his Capitol-distributed Bust It Records imprint. Later that same year, Boyd released her debut album, entitled B Angie B, which was co-produced by Hammer and Felton Pilate, who was a former member of Con Funk Shun. In April 1991, the album debuted at #11 on the Billboard Hip-hop/R&B; charts. It peaked at #133 on the Billboard 200.Joel Whitburn, The Billboard Albums. 6th edition, 2006, p. 72. The release of the album was led by the single \\"So Much Love\\", followed by two covers: \\"Sweet Thing\\", originally by Rufus & Chaka Khan, and \\"I Don't Want To Lose Your Love\\", originally by The Emotions. \\"I Don't Want to Lose Your Love\\" was the album's biggest hit, reaching #54 on the Billboard Hot 100.Joel Whitburn, Top Pop Singles. 12th edition, 2009, p. 68. She toured with Johnny Gill around the time of the album's release. In July 1991, she began dating Tyson again while on tour with several Bust It musicians. She would later become a prominent witness in Tyson's 1992 rape trial.\\"Rapper's Visit to See Tyson Causes Stir at Prison\\". Jet, May 11, 1992. (Google Books link) She appeared in the Kid 'n Play farce Class Act and sang on the soundtrack title track \\"Class Act (Work That Body)\\". The title track was also released as a video. Late in 1991, Boyd left Capitol. Boyd released a second album in 1995 under the Bust It label (with independent distribution). She dropped the first \\"B\\" and was known as Angie B. The album was preceded by the single \\"It's My Life\\"; neither the album nor the single charted. Nevertheless, critics have identified her as a forerunner of neo soul R&B;, which became more prominent over the course of the 1990s and beyond; Alex Henderson of Allmusic noted, \\"B Angie B did her part to bring soul music to a hip-hop/urban contemporary generation...she was doing that type of thing before the rise of Mary J. Blige, D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, or Jill Scott.\\" At the turn of 2000, B Angie B (now amicably divorced from James Earley) resided back in Mississippi and with Earley had one child, a daughter. Her 1991 solo debut B Angie B on Capitol records was reissued in mid-2005 with a bonus DVD along with previous releases from former label mates Oaktown's 3.5.7. In the summer of 2009, new music was released on her Myspace page (www.myspace.com/bangiebmusic), including a remake of \\"Ring My Bell\\".

The great-grandson of John Harris Heal, founder of the Heals furniture manufacturing and retail business, he attended Marlborough College (Oxford Dictionary of National Biography) before serving a two-year apprenticeship to cabinetmakers James Plucknett in Warwick. This was followed by six months working for Graham and Biddle, furnishers, of London's Oxford Street. In 1893 he joined Heal & Son, working in the bedding factory, but in the mid-1890s he began designing simple, sturdy furniture, often in plain oak (in contrast to Heals' standard \\"Queen Anne\\" and \\"Old English\\" styles). Although initially not popular with sales staff ‚Äì who called them \\"prison furniture\\" ‚Äì his designs appeared at exhibitions of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, and soon became so successful that prejudices were overcome. He continued to exhibit special pieces at Arts and Crafts exhibitions for more than thirty years, but his most significant contribution was to make simpler, well-designed, well-made furniture available to a broader middle-class public. Undoubtedly influenced by the ideas of John Ruskin and William Morris, he nonetheless took advantage of machinery where appropriate. His simple, no-frills designs, created around 1905, appealed particularly to the inhabitants of the new Garden Cities and Suburbs. He had already patented (with Hamilton Temple Smith) a unit furniture system in 1915 when he became a founding member of the Design and Industries Association, which campaigned for \\"Fitness for Purpose\\" in industrial production. In 1913, on the death of his father, he was elected chairman of Heals, using this position to champion artistic design within furniture manufacture and marketing. In 1933, he was knighted for raising standards of design, and in 1939 was elected to the Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry. The Royal Society of Arts awarded him the Albert Gold Medal for services to industrial design in 1954. Although Heals continued to produce beds and mattresses as its staple, Heal diversified its range to include ceramics, glass, and textiles, as well as products in Art Deco style. He established an art gallery at the Tottenham Court Road premises showing works by Picasso, Wyndham Lewis and Modigliani. Artists such as Claud Lovat Fraser designed the company's posters, and its catalogues contained essays by influential art critics. The overall effect was to promote Heals as an iconic brand. Heal's influence over the company diminished in the mid-1930s, when one of his sons became managing director. Although considering retirement, he stayed as chairman during World War II, finally retiring in 1953. Under his leadership sales of the Heal business grew from ¬£75,000 p.a. in 1900 to in excess of ¬£300,000 in the mid-1930s. Apart from work interests, he collected London historical ephemera, mainly from the 17th and 18th centuries, including records of tradesmen, goldsmiths, calligraphers, signboards and furniture makers. His collection of trade-cards is preserved at the British Museum. He was the author of five books: London Tradesmen's Cards of the XVIII Century 1925, The English Writing Masters and their Copy Books 1931, The London Goldsmiths 1935, Signboards of Old London Shops 1947, The London Furniture Makers 1953. In addition The Records of the Heal Family was printed for private circulation. He contributed articles on a variety of topics in connection with his historical research to publications such as The Connoisseur and Country Life. Heal was married twice: in 1895 to Alice Rose Rippingille (d. 1901), and in 1904 to Edith Florence Digby Todhunter (d. 1946). He also had affairs in the 1920s with Prudence Maufe and Dodie Smith. His Times obituary describes him as \\"one of the great artists and craftsmen of his time\\". The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography article by Alan Crawford describes this as \\"very wide of the mark\\" and accounts of his life and work as prone to hagiography, \\"but it showed what a powerful image he had created for his shop, and thus for himself\\". An English Heritage blue plaque commemorating Heal was placed at The Fives Court on Moss Lane in Pinner, north London, in 2013.

The main purpose for establishing it was to assist in navigation and mapping by recording the latitude and maintaining time standards. In later years the observatory also made observations on stars and geomagnetism. The observatory ran from around 1792 to 1931 and a major work was the production of a comprehensive catalogue of stars.  History  The observatory c. 1838 The observatory was established due to the efforts of William Petrie, an amateur astronomer who had a small private observatory at Egmore in Madras. Petrie's original observatory was established in 1786 and was made of iron and timber. In 1789, Petrie gifted his instruments to the Madras Government before retiring to England. Sir Charles Oakley accepted Petrie's plea to establish an official observatory for the purpose of \\"promoting the knowledge of astronomy, geography and navigation in India\\". The building was designed by Michael Topping on the bank of the river Cooum at Nungambakkam. The building consisted of a single room 40 feet long and 20 feet wide with a 15-foot ceiling. At the centre a granite pillar of 10 tons supported a 12-inch azimuth transit circle instrument made by Troughton. These were used to make observations on the meridian that began in 9 January 1793. Topping died in 1796 and was succeeded by John Goldingham who was formerly Petrie's assistant, Government Architect and Editor of the Government Gazette apart from serving as first superintendent of the Engineering School. Goldingham determined the longitude as 80¬∞ 18' 30\\" based on eclipses of Jupiter's moons. This was the value used as a benchmark by William Lambton for the Great Trigonometrical Survey. When Goldingham went on leave between 1805 and 1810, the observatory was maintained by Lt. John Warren (born Jean-Baptiste Francois Joseph de Warren, 21 September 1769 ‚Äì 9 February 1830, Pondicherry) who recalculated the longitude as 80¬∞17'21\\"E. He recorded observations on the comet of September 1807 and computed the declinations of several stars. Goldingham returned in 1812 and served until 1830 when he was replaced by Thomas Glanville Taylor who measured the positions of 11,000 stars which were published in five volumes which came to be known as the \\"Madras Catalogue\\". Taylor's estimate of the longitude for Madras was 80¬∞14'20\\"E. Taylor also made observations on the comet of 1831. Inside of the Observatory in Goldingham's time Taylor was replaced by Captain William Stephen Jacob in 1848, who continued the work on star positions. Jacob found orbital anomalies in the binary star 70 Ophiuchi that he claimed were evidence of a possible extrasolar planet. From 1859 to 1861 Major J.F. Tennant was in charge of the observatory and magnetic observations began to be made using vertical force and declination magnetometers. In 1861, N. R. Pogson became astronomer. Pogson was assisted by C. Ragoonathachary. In 1872, an accurate clock was added to the observatory and a telegraph line between the observatory and Fort St George helped in accurate timing of a gun at noon and 8 pm. Three rooms were added for photography. Pogson was succeeded by C. Michie Smith who moved to Kodaikanal to study solar physics in 1899. After this period only routine astronomy for time-keeping purposes was continued, as well as weather observations, and in 1931 the observatory was shut down. The granite pillar continues to stand and a more recent inscription has the \\"Madras Meridian\\" marked on it.

It is part of the genus Helogale and as such related to Helogale hirtula. Physical characteristics The common dwarf mongoose is a typical mongoose: it has a large pointed head, small ears, a long tail, short limbs and long claws. The species can be distinguished from other mongooses by its size. It is much smaller than most other species (18 to 28 cm, 210 to 350 grams); in fact, it is Africa's smallest member of the order Carnivora. The soft fur is very variable in color, ranging from yellowish red to very dark brown. Distribution and habitat The common dwarf mongoose is primarily found in dry grassland, open forests, and bush land, up to 2,000 m in altitude. It is especially common in areas with many termite mounds, their favorite sleeping place. The species avoids dense forests and deserts. The common dwarf mongoose can also be found in the surroundings of settlements, and can become quite tame. From the Sabi Sands region of South Africa The species ranges from East to southern Central Africa, from Eritrea and Ethiopia to the provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga in the Republic of South Africa. Subspecies *Helogale parvula parvula *Helogale parvula ivori *Helogale parvula mimetra *Helogale parvula nero *Helogale parvula ruficeps *Helogale parvula undulatus *Helogale parvula varia Behaviour In the Serengeti The common dwarf mongoose is a diurnal animal. It is a highly social species that lives in extended family groups of two to thirty animals. There is a strict hierarchy among same-sexed animals within a group, headed by the dominant pair (normally the oldest group members). All group members cooperate in helping to rear the pups and in guarding the group from predators. Young mongooses attain sexual maturity by one year of age but delay dispersal, with males usually emigrating (in the company of their brothers) at 2‚Äì3 years old. Dispersing males may join other established groups, either as subordinates or by ousting the resident males, or they may found new groups with unrelated dispersing females. In contrast, females normally remain in their home group for life, queuing for the dominant position. They will, however, emigrate to found a new group if they lose their place in the hierarchy to a younger sister. Dwarf mongooses are territorial, and each group uses an area of approximately 30-60 hectares (depending on the type of habitat). They sleep at night in disused termite mounds, although they occasionally use piles of stones, hollow trees, etc. The mongooses mark their territory with anal gland and cheek gland secretions and latrines. Territories often overlap slightly, which can lead to confrontations between different groups, with the larger group tending to win. Dwarf mongooses tend to breed during the wet season, between October and April, raising up to three litters. Usually only the group's dominant female becomes pregnant, and she is responsible for 80% of the pups reared by the group. If conditions are good, subordinate females may also become pregnant, but their pups rarely survive. After the gestation period of 53 days, 4-6 young are born. They remain below ground within a termite mound for the first 2‚Äì3 weeks. Normally one or more members of the group stay behind to babysit while the group goes foraging. Subordinate females often produce milk to feed the dominant female's pups. At 4 weeks of age the pups begin accompanying the group. All group members help to provide them with prey items until they are around 10 weeks old. A mutualistic relationship has evolved between dwarf mongooses and hornbills, in which hornbills seek out the mongooses in order for the two species to forage together, and to warn each other of nearby raptors and other predators.Anne O, Rasa E (1983). \\"Dwarf mongoose and hornbill mutualism in the Taru desert, Kenya.\\" Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 12 (3): 181‚Äì90. Diet The diet of the common dwarf mongoose consists of insects (mainly beetle larvae, termites, grasshoppers and crickets), spiders, scorpions, small lizards, snakes, small birds, and rodents, and is supplemented very occasionally with berries.

Each span was two lanes wide, and they had a clearance of for most of the bridge, with a clearance at the bascule bridge section. Hurricane Katrina After Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, the old Twin Spans suffered extensive damage, as the rising storm surge had pulled or shifted bridge segments off their piers. The eastbound span was missing 38 segments with another 170 misaligned, while the westbound span was missing 26 segments with 265 misaligned. The damage to the Twin Spans and to U.S. Route 90 to the east left only one route into New Orleans from the east, the U.S. Route 11 bridge just west of the Twin Spans. The Louisiana Department of Transportation & Development (DOTD) accepted a bid of $30.9 million from Boh Brothers Construction Company on September 9, 2005 to reconstruct the bridges, starting with the less damaged westbound span. Phase 1 of the project was to reestablish two-way traffic on the eastbound span within 45 days.I-10 damage of old bridges over Lake Pontchartrain. Scavenged bridge segments from the westbound span were used to fill in the gaps in the eastbound span. On October 10, 2005, the east span was reopened to traffic with one lane in each direction. The original contract planned for 43 days - the contractor completed the project 15 days ahead of schedule and was awarded a bonus of $1.1 million. Phase 2 of the project was occurring concurrently with Phase 1 and involved repairs to the westbound span. Prefabricated steel bridge spans were used on the westbound bridge in two areas to replace destroyed segments and segments used on the eastbound span. The west span reopened on January 6, 2006, returning four lanes of traffic to flow once again. Due to the prefabricated steel segments, there were both a -per-hour speed limit and weight restrictions on the westbound span. Additionally, the span was closed periodically for maintenance work, which is covered by Phase 3 of the original contract. Current Twin Span Following the extensive damages from Hurricane Katrina, it was decided that the old Twin Spans were too vulnerable to storm surge and that the long term solution would be to construct two new spans. Ground was broken on July 13, 2006 on the project, which constructed two new bridges east of the old spans. This $803 million project constructed two three-lane bridges above the surface of Lake Ponchartrain, with an high rise near Slidell. Each span is wide, consisting of three lanes, and shoulders on each side. The wider bridges eliminated the bottlenecking that occurred at both ends of the old bridges and also are able to accommodate 50 percent more traffic than the old twin spans, according to the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development.Monteverde, Daniel.

Mac, the director of Helm's secret government agency, learns that a dangerous enemy operative, Hans Holz, also known as the Woodman, has been contracted, presumably by the Soviets, to kill whichever candidate is elected in the upcoming elections in November 1968. The Woodman, it appears, has also recently been responsible for the death of Michael Kingston, an agent with whom Helm has just worked in an earlier book. Helm, the veteran counter- assassin, is ordered by Mac to get into position to remove the Woodman‚Äîpermanently. Not to avenge Kingston ‚Äî Mac's agents are supposed to be able to take care of themselves ‚Äî but to forestall any more political chaos. As frequently happens in Hamilton's books, however, Helm is not sent to stalk Holz directly. He is inserted into an operation currently being carried out by a rival government agency, one that is trying to thwart Communist plans to obtain secret information about a major American-Canadian security project called the Northwest Coastal System. A man named Grant Nystrom has been recruited by the Communists to take delivery at five different points of microfilms of the project as he travels through the Northwest and into Alaska playing the role of a dedicated fisherman. Both Nystrom and his trained Labrador dog have recently been murdered, however, and Helm resembles Nystrom enough to enable him to take his place. A standard plot device in Helm stories is to have a second government agency working either at complete cross- purposes to Mac's agency, or at least at semi-cross-purposes. Helm is recruited to apparently carry out the instructions of the second agency but actually has his own mission to accomplish, regardless of how this may finally thwart the wishes of the other agency. In The Interlopers this tension runs throughout the book‚Äîand is complicated by the fact that a mysterious third party, the so-called interlopers, appears with a Grant Nystrom lookalike of their own, complete with his own black Labrador, in an apparent attempt to accumulate the secret microfilm for their own purposes. There are, as in all Helm books, at least two beautiful, and somewhat mysterious, women, whose patriotic affiliations are questionable right to the end of the story, and who cause both complications and murderous attacks on Helm. He survives the attacks, however, in the course of which he kills, mostly by guns, but occasionally by knife, at least six or seven enemy operatives of various loyalties. On page 89, in a motel cabin surrounded by dead bodies, he is obliged to set the scene for the forthcoming policemen by leaving behind the small four-inch-bladed knife that has been featured in most of the books since the very first ‚Äî \\"it had been given to me by a woman, now dead, who'd once meant a good deal to me ‚Äî but this was no time for sentimentality.\\" Other standard features in many of the Helm books play their roles here. Hamilton likes to carry an occasional character from one story to the next. One of the numerous conflicting groups interested in obtaining the secret microfilm is apparently directed by an unseen Chinese agent named Mr. Soo. Although he himself makes no appearance in The Interlopers, he had come to Helm's aid in the previous book, The Menacers, and will show up again in a future book. Another feature is the last page or so of Hamilton's books, after the action has been completed. A minor (but beautiful) female character unexpectedly reappears, either in need of physical and spiritual recuperation herself or there to offer it to the severely tested Helm. As usual, there is a two- or three-word final paragraph: :\\"It was Mac's idea of a safe rest and rehabilitation for both of us ‚Äî simpler, cheaper, and less obvious than turning the wigpickers loose on us; and more effective if it worked. :\\"It worked.\\" And as in many of the books, Helm also finds time to reflect on the deficiencies of Detroit automakers: \\"Even commercial vehicles are encumbered with a lot of Mickey Mouse gadgets these days ‚Äî that big, rugged, powerful truck engine was decorated with a cute little automatic choke, for God's sake! Apparently modern-day truck drivers are considered too stupid and feeble to pull a knob out of a dashboard.\\" One feature in The Interlopers that is not a standard Hamilton plot device occurs on page 175 when, for one of the very few times in the series, the super-competent and super-foresighted Helm falls into an enemy ambush that he had not planned for or anticipated. After waking up bound hand and foot, he reflects \\"grimly\\" that \\"knowing that the critical moment of the mission had to be close at hand, I'd let the frantic howling of a year-old pup send me rushing blindly into an ambush any first-year trainee could have avoided in his sleep.\\" In spite of this single moment of weakness, however, Helm, with a little help from various female characters as well as his \\"year-old pup\\", manages to carry out his mission successfully.

H. Weiler. The New York Times 14 Dec 1969: D23. A romantic suspense thriller with espionage elements, the script was based on both a same-titled novel by Ronald Kirkbride, and the non-fiction book documenting the case of real-life double agent George Blake titled The Springing of George Blake by Sean Bourke, the motion picture rights to both of which Hitchcock acquired. Plot Gavin Brand, a double agent, has escaped from London's Wormwood Scrubs Prison. An American named Joe Bailey, brother to one of Brand's victims, is called on by the CIA to kill Brand through finding his family. The objective, as put by CIA chief Zelfand, is to \\"find the wife and kids, find the husband.\\" Bailey reluctantly accepts the assignment to kill Brand and finally tracks down Brand's family to a private island near Savonlinna in Finland, where they are watched over by Hilda and Olga, two Soviet minders. Bailey and Brand's wife, Carla, develop a romance as he waits patiently for Brand to show up. After they consummate their love, Brand arrives and attempts to kill both Bailey and Carla, leading to her becoming trapped in a gas-styled sauna. Bailey rescues Carla and, with the help of a Finnish police officer, they try to stop Brand making it to the Finnish-Soviet border on a train with his kidnapped children. Production Hitchcock commissioned screenplays by James Costigan and frequent collaborator Ernest Lehman, both of whom wrote several drafts. The script draft by David Freeman, reproduced in Freeman's book The Last Days of Alfred Hitchcock, takes place after the prison break out of Gavin Brand (the screenplay's version of Blake).https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/12/from-the-archive- working-with-hitchcock-on-his-last-film-1982 Hitchcock, comparing his intentions for the project to Notorious, considered Walter Matthau, a onetime guest star on Alfred Hitchcock Presents, for the role of Brand. He also reportedly offered the same role to Ed Lauter, who appeared in Family Plot, as well as Sean Connery, Clint Eastwood, and Steve McQueen. French international film star Catherine Deneuve and Norwegian star Liv Ullmann were considered for the leading female role. The movie was to be filmed on location in Finland. Because of the director's ill health, Universal Pictures cancelled the project in 1979, and the film never got beyond the early pre-production stage with such Hitchcock associates as Norman Lloyd, Henry Bumstead and Robert F.

Background Jennings' second release of 1971 finds the singer moving further away from the Nashville Sound that had dominated his early albums at RCA. Its title track, a morbid tale of murder, reached #14 on the country singles chart, and the LP also contains \\"It's All Over Now,\\" written by Waylon's wife Jessi Colter, who duets with Jennings on Paul Simon's \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" and also appears on the album cover with him. Like most country albums during this period, Cedartown, Georgia contains songs that were recorded during numerous sessions that stretched back over periods of months and even years, depriving the album of any sense of continuity. As Michael Striessguth's laments in his book Outlaw: Waylon, Willie, Kris, and the Renegades of Nashville, \\"Because RCA-Nashville failed to embrace the idea of the concept album, it happily dropped unreleased scraps from earlier sessions into those collections, spoiling any semblance of cohesion that they might have had.\\" In his autobiography Jennings wrote, \\"They always needed a marketing plan...Music is just music, and people who put labels on music are those who have to merchandize it. It makes their job a lot easier. I wanted to cut my records a whole different way; I wanted to build the song in the studio, not in the control room. I wanted the dynamics to happen out there with the band.\\" Reception The album peaked at #27 on the Billboard country albums chart, his fourth LP in a row that failed to crack the Top 10. At the time of its release, however, the LP got an unexpected rave from Rolling Stone, which enthused, \\"It's this album that Waylon goes after everybody (including your mother) and intends to bring everybody over to his side. It's all Dynamite stuff...Word is that if Waylon Jennings isn't already a country superstar, he soon will be.\\" Thom Jurek of AllMusic praises Jennings' performances but disparages the production of Danny Davis: \\"The window dressing added by Davis waters down its impact and makes Jennings' job as a singer more difficult... Cedartown, Georgia feels just like what it is, a decent collection of songs and inspired performances marred by production nonsense. Indeed, a quick listen to the album and it becomes difficult to see why Davis worked with Jennings at all.\\" Track listing # \\"Cedartown, Georgia\\" (Mack Vickery, Sammi Smith, Charlie Cobble) ‚Äì 2:48 # \\"Big D\\" (Jan Crutchfield) ‚Äì 2:29 # \\"The House Song\\" (Paul Stookey, Robert Bannard) ‚Äì 3:29 # \\"Tomorrow Night in Baltimore\\" (Kenny Price) ‚Äì 3:03 # \\"Pickin' White Gold\\" (Fred Carter) ‚Äì 2:34 # \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" (Paul Simon) ‚Äì 3:56 with Jessi Colter # \\"It's All Over Now\\" (Jessi Colter) ‚Äì 2:32 # \\"I'm Gonna Leave (While I Still Love You)\\" (Martha Sharp) ‚Äì 3:05 # \\"I've Got Eyes for You\\" (Del Shannon, Brian Hyland) ‚Äì 2:35 # \\"Let Me Stay Awhile\\" (Mickey Newbury) ‚Äì 2:22 References 1971 albums Waylon Jennings albums RCA Records albums Murder ballads ","title":"Cedartown, Georgia (album)"},{"id":"6433658","text":"Hell Cat is a wooden roller coaster designed and built by S&S; Power located at Clementon Amusement Park.

His career included All- Ireland Championship victories as a player and later as a manager with the Kilkenny senior hurling team. After beginning his career at club level with Thomastown, Walsh joined the Kilkenny minor team as a 15-year-old in 1953 and won a Leinster Minor Championship in 1955. After a brief stint with the junior side, he was promoted to the Kilkenny senior team in 1956. From his debut, Walsh was ever-present as a goalkeeper and made a total of 42 championship appearances in a career that ended with his last game in 1972. During that time he was part of five All-Ireland Championship-winning teams ‚Äì in 1957, 1963, 1967, 1969 and 1972. Walsh also secured 10 Leinster Championship medals and two National Hurling League medals. After his playing career, Walsh found success as both a club and inter-county manager. After gaining managerial experience with the Carlow senior hurling team, he guided his own Thomastown club to a Kilkenny Intermediate Championship title in 1983. After a hugely successful tenure with the Kilkenny junior team, Walsh managed the senior team to several All-Ireland Chmapionship, Leinster Championship and National League successes over a five-year period. Noted for his swashbuckling style, which included blocking, side-stepping his opponents and clearing the sliotar down the field, Walsh is regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers in the history of the game. He was named Texaco Hurler of the Year in 1967, and was also selected on the Gaelic Weekly Team of the Year on three occasions. Playing career Thomastown Walsh began his hurling career at club level with Thomastown. After coming to prominence at schoolboy level, he enjoyed a hugely successful juvenile and underage career, winning a total of seven county championship medals in various grades between 1947 and 1954. The high point of Walsh's club career occurred on 16 December 1962 when he claimed a Kilkenny Junior Championship title after a 7-09 to 4-04 defeat of Coon in the final. Graiguenamanagh As a Gaelic footballer with Graiguenamanagh, Walsh was at left corner-back when the club faced Glenmore in the final of the 1956 Kilkenny Senior Championship. After an initial draw, he claimed a winners' medal after the 1-03 to 1-01 victory in the delayed replay. Kilkenny =Minor and junior= Walsh first played for Kilkenny as a 15-year-old when he was drafted onto the minor team for the 1953 Leinster Championship. He made his debut on 21 June 1953 when Kilkenny suffered a 3-06 to 4-01 defeat by Dublin. In spite of the defeat, Walsh's \\"great display\\" was highlighted in a match report in the Irish Independent. Kilkenny and Dublin renewed their rivalry at minor level when the sides once again clashed in the 1954 Leinster final, however, Walsh ended the game on the losing side after lining out at midfield in the 4-12 to 4-07 defeat. Walsh was eligible for the minor grade for a third successive season and, for the second successive season, he lined out in the decider when Kilkenny qualified to play Wexford in the 1955 Leinster final. He was again denied a provincial final victory when the game ended in a 3-10 to 5-04 draw. The replay a week later saw Walsh finally claim a Leinster Minor Championship medal after the 0-11 to 0-08 victory. His underage career ended on 7 August 1955 with a 3-13 to 1-08 defeat by Tipperary in the All-Ireland semi-final. After being overage for the minor team the following year, Walsh was drafted on the Kilkenny junior team. He made his debut in that grade on 8 April 1956 when he lined out in goal in a 3-06 to 2-02 defeat of Wexford in the Leinster Junior Championship. =Senior= Walsh's performances in the minor and junior grades drew the attention of the senior selectors and he was one of a number of players promoted to the Kilkenny senior team prior to the start of the 1956 Leinster Championship. He made his first appearance in the senior ranks as an 18-year-old on 20 May 1956 in a 6-11 to 3-09 defeat of Westmeath. On 8 July 1956, Walsh lined out in his first Leinster final, however, Kilkenny suffered a 4-08 to 3-10 defeat by Wexford. On 12 May 1957, Walsh contested his first national final when Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the final of the 1956-57 National League. He ended the game on the losing side after a 3-11 to 2-07 defeat. Walsh lined out in a second successive Leinster final on 4 August 1957 and claimed his first winners' medal after the 6-09 to 1-05 defeat of Wexford. On 1 September 1957, he again lined out in goal when Kilkenny faced Waterford in the All-Ireland final. Walsh ended the game with his first winners' medal after the 4-10 to 3-12 victory. Walsh lined out in a second successive provincial decider when Kilkenny qualified to play Wexford in the 1958 Leinster final. He ended the game with a second successive winners' medal after being described in the Irish Independent as an \\"inspiration\\" following the 5-12 to 4-09 victory. On 12 July 1959, Walsh lined out in the fourth Leinster final of his career with Dublin providing the opposition. He was at fault for conceding a goal after bringing down a high ball, however, he ended the game with a third successive winners' medal after the 2-09 to 1-11 victory. On 6 September 1959, Walsh played in his second All-Ireland final when Kilkenny faced Waterford at Croke Park. He gave a commanding display in goal, in spite of conceding five goals, in the 1-17 to 5-05 draw. The replay on 4 October 1959 saw Walsh bring off a number of important saves, however, he ended the game on the losing side after the 3-12 to 1-10 defeat. After failing to make it four successive provincial titles in-a-row after losing out to Wexford in the 1960 Leinster final, Kilkenny failed to even qualify for the following year's final. On 6 May 1962, Walsh claimed his second national title when Kilkenny defeated Cork by 1-16 to 1-08 to claim the National League title for the first time in 30 years. He was subsequently denied a fourth Leinster Championship medal as Kilkenny suffered a 3-09 to 2-10 defeat by Wexford in the 1962 Leinster final. Walsh claimed his fourth provincial winners' medal after making his seventh final appearance in the 2-10 to 0-09 defeat of Dublin in the 1963 Leinster final. On 1 September 1963, he lined out in goal for the fourth time in seven seasons against Waterford in an All-Ireland final. Walsh conceded six goals over the course of the game, however, he \\"brought off many fantastic saves, four of them in quick succession in the opening minutes and the last, and certainly the most valuable, when he stopped a downward drive from Power, when Waterford were only two points in arrears, with only four minutes of the hour remaining.\\" Having collected his second All-Ireland winners' medal after the 4-17 to 6-08 victory, he ended the season by being named in the goalkeeping position on the 1963 Gaelic Weekly Team of the Year. After collecting a fifth provincial title after the 4-11 to 1-08 defeat of Dublin in the 1964 Leinster final, Walsh lined out in a second consecutive All-Ireland final on 6 September 1964. In spite of being regarded as the favourites, Kilkenny ended the game as runners- up after a 5-13 to 2-08 defeat by Tipperary. Walsh ended the season by being named on the Gaelic Weekly Team of the Year for a second successive occasion. On 23 May 1965, Walsh was in goal when Kilkenny suffered a 3-14 to 2-08 defeat by Tipperary in the home final of the 1964-65 National League. Kilkenny subsequently failed in their bid to secure the Leinster Championship for a third successive year, with Walsh incurring his fourth provincial decider loss after a 2-11 to 3-07 defeat by Wexford in the 1965 Leinster final. Walsh claimed the sixth provincial winners' medal after a 1-15 to 2-06 defeat of Wexford in the 1966 Leinster final. On 4 September 1966, he conceded a hat- trick of goals by Colm Sheehan when Kilkenny suffered a 3-09 to 1-10 defeat by Cork in the All-Ireland final. In spite of this defeat, Walsh ended the season with a second National League winners' medal after an aggregate victory of 10-15 to 2-15 over New York in the final. After failing to retain the National League title following a 3-10 to 1-09 defeat by Wexford in the 1966-67 final, Kilkenny later turned the tables on Wexford with Walsh claiming his seventh Leinster Championship winners' medal after a 4-10 to 1-12 victory in the 1967 Leinster final. On 3 September 1967, he claimed his third All-Ireland winners' medal after a 3-08 to 2-07 victory and a first All-Ireland final win over Tipperary in 45 years. Walsh ended the season by becoming the first of only three goalkeepers to be named Texaco Hurler of the Year. On 12 May 1968, Walsh was in goal when Kilkenny were beaten 3-09 to 1-13 by Tipperary in the final of the 1967-68 National League. The ill-tempered game saw Walsh being struck by John Flanagan. He was subsequently found ‚Äúguilty of jabbing with the hurley‚Äù and suspended for six months, with some theorising that the GAA were out to punish him after he had expressed his opposition to the Ban during the course of an appearance on The Late Late Show. Tipperary player Babs Keating believes that Walsh was a scapegoat, stating: \\"I felt sorry for him. No one has any quibble if justice is done but in that ease, justice wasn't done.\\" The suspension ruled him out of the 1968 Leinster Championship, with the Kilkenny County Board considering whether to withdraw from the competition. Such was the esteem that Walsh was held in, the 1968 Kilkenny Hurling Championship was delayed on purpose while he served his suspension. Reinstated as first-choice goalkeeper in advance of the 1969 Leinster Championship, Walsh claimed his eighth provincial winners' medal after a 3-09 to 0-16 defeat of Offaly in the final. On 7 September 1969, he made his eighth All-Ireland final appearance - his second against Cork in the space of four seasons - and claimed his fourth All-Ireland winners' medal after the 2-15 to 2-09 victory. After surrendering the provincial title to Wexford in the 1970 Leinster final, Walsh claimed a ninth Leinster Championship the following year after a 6-16 to 3-16 defeat of the reigning champions. On 5 September 1971, he made his ninth appearance in an All-Ireland final when Kilkenny suffered a 5-17 to 5-14 defeat by Tipperary. Walsh was replaced as goalkeeper by his cousin, Noel Skehan, for the 1972 Leinster Championship, however, he remained as stand-by goalkeeper and claimed his 10th Leinster Championship medal from the substitutes bench after a 3-16 to 1-14 defeat of Wexford. On 3 September 1972, he claimed his fifth All-Ireland winners' medal from the substitutes' bench after a 3-24 to 5-11 defeat of Cork in the final. Leinster Walsh's performances for Kilkenny during the 1957 All-Ireland Championship led to his inclusion as first-choice goalkeeper in the Leinster team for the 1958 Railway Cup. Munster dominated the competition at the time, with Walsh losing three finals in his first four seasons with the team. He claimed his first winners' medal on 17 March 1962 when he lined out in goal in Leinster's 1-11 to 1-09 defeat of Munster in the final. After surrendering the title to Munster the following year, Walsh won back-to-back medals in 1964 and 1965 after back-to-back defeats of Munster. Three in-a-row proved beyond Leinster, however, he claimed his fourth winners' medal as captain of the side in 1967 after a 2-14 to 3-05 victory over Munster once again. Walsh remained as first-choice goalkeeper until his last appearance in the 1970 Railway Cup final defeat by Munster. Managerial career Early career Walsh began his coaching career at club when he took charge of the Dicksboro minor and senior teams in the late 1970s. His first taste of inter-county management came in 1979 when he was appointed as a selector to the Kilkenny minor team. He helped guide the team, which featured his son Michael in goal, to the Leinster Championship title, however, the side suffered defeat by Cork in the All-Ireland final. In March 1980, Walsh was appointed coach of the Carlow senior hurling team. After incurring a 5-21 to 3-16 All-Ireland home final defeat by Kildare in the 1980 All-Ireland B Championship, he guided the team to promotion to Division 1 of the National Hurling League the following year. After a second All-Ireland home final defeat in three seasons, this time by Antrim, Walsh stepped down as coach immediately after the game. Walsh returned to club management when he took charge of his native Thomastown club in 1983. He ended the year by guiding the club to the Kilkenny Intermediate Championship title after a defeat of O'Loughlin Gaels, two decades after he had helped the club gain promotion to the intermediate grade as a player. Walsh returned to inter- county management the following year when he was appointed manager of the Kilkenny junior team. The team went on the dominate during this era, winning five Leinster Junior Championships over the course of seven seasons, which were converted to All-Ireland Junior Championship wins in 1984, 1986, 1988 and 1990. Kilkenny manager After a decade of involvement with the Kilkenny minor, under-21 and junior teams at various times, Walsh was appointed manager of the Kilkenny senior hurling team in a caretaker capacity on 19 October 1990. His first game in charge a week later saw Kilkenny secure a home victory over Dublin in the first round of the 1990-91 National League. After securing the Leinster Championship with a late goal against Dublin in the final, Walsh guided the team to a first All-Ireland final appearance in four years and a first meeting with Tipperary in 20 years. A mishit Michael Cleary shot produced a goal which was the deciding factor in the 1-16 to 0-15 defeat for Kilkenny. Walsh launched a stinging attack on referee Willie Horgan immediately after the game, describing his performance as \\"the worst exhibition I have ever witnessed in an All-Ireland final.\\" Walsh remained at the helm for the 1991-92 season but made a number of changes to his team. Substitute Pat O'Neill broke onto the starting fifteen as first-choice centre- back in place of Pat Dwyer who moved to full-back as a replacement for the retired John Henderson. These changes helped the team to a second successive Leinster Championship after a 3-16 to 2-09 defeat of Wexford in the final. For the second year in succession, Kilkenny qualified for the All-Ireland final where they faced Cork for the first time since 1978. The 3-10 to 1-12 victory gave Kilkenny their first All-Ireland Championship title in nine years and Walsh's first as manager. After indicating his desire to remain as manager, Walsh was reappointed in October 1992. He bolstered his team by adding P. J. Delaney in place of retired full-forward Liam Fennelly, while Liam Keoghan was added to the defence as a replacement for Liam Walsh. Kilkenny remained undefeated in the Leinster Championship for a third successive year, with the team claiming the title after a 2-12 to 0-11 defeat of Wexford. Walsh later steered the team to a third successive All-Ireland final appearance and a third title in-a-row after the 2-17 to 1-15 defeat of Galway. In the aftermath of the All-Ireland victory, Walsh stated: \\"I think this team are good enough to go on and win four in-a-row. They have all the qualities to do so.\\" In spite of this boast, Kilkenny found themselves in Division 2 of the 1993-94 National League, however, they did secure promotion to the top tier after finishing in second place. The quest for a third successive All-Ireland Championship ended with a four-point Leinster semi-final defeat by Offaly. Walsh claimed a National League title as manager when Kilkenny defeated Clare by 2-12 to 0-09 in the final of the 1994-95 National League, however, Kilkenny once again failed to Offaly in the Leinster Championship. On 11 August 1995, Walsh announced his shock resignation as manager stating: \\"I think now is a good time to go.\\" Personal life Walsh met his wife, Olive Murphy, in the late 1950s and they married at St. John's Church in Kilkenny in September 1960.

The name is derived from the Latin Agens in Rebus, corresponding to the Greek Apocrisiarius (both have specific historical secular uses in the Roman/ Byzantine empires). We first meet these agents for ecclesiastical matters not at the court of Rome, but at the imperial palace of Constantinople. Owing to the close connection between Church and State under the early Christian emperors and the absence of canons concerning many matters of mixed jurisdiction, the principal bishops found it necessary to maintain agents to look after their interests at the imperial court. Until the French Revolution, the prelates of France maintained similar agents at the royal court of St. Denis. (See Assembly of the French clergy.) In modern times the agents of the Roman Congregations are employed by bishops or private persons to transact their affairs in the pontifical courts. Such an agency is undertaken temporarily or perpetually. The principal business of the agents is to urge the expedition of the cases of their patrons. They undertake both judicial and extrajudicial business. If it is a question of papal favors, such as dispensations or increased faculties, these agents prepare the proper supplications and call repeatedly on the officials of the proper congregation until an answer is obtained. They expend whatever money is necessary to pay for the legal documents or to advance in general the affairs of those who employ them. The agents have a recognized position in the Roman Curia, and rank next in dignity before the apostolic notaries. The money they expend and the pay they receive depend entirely on the will of their employers. Some authors include under this name the solicitors and apostolic expeditors of the Roman Curia, whose business it is to assist the procurators in the mechanical details of the preparation of cases for the congregational tribunals. Usually, however, these functionaries are considered as distinct from agents and as outranking them in dignity.

It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. The grey mongoose inhabits open forests, scrublands and cultivated fields, often close to human habitation. It lives in burrows, hedgerows and thickets, among groves of trees, and takes shelter under rocks or bushes and even in drains. It is very bold and inquisitive but wary, seldom venturing far from cover. It climbs very well. Usually found singly or in pairs. It preys on rodents, snakes, birds‚Äô eggs and hatchlings, lizards and variety of invertebrates. Along the Chambal River it occasionally feeds on gharial eggs. It breeds throughout the year. Characteristics The Indian grey mongoose has tawny grey or iron grey fur, which is more grizzled and stiffer and coarser than that of other mongooses. The ruddiness of the coat varies in different subspecies, but it is described as appearing more grey than other mongooses. The grizzled appearance comes from the individual hairs being ringed by creamy-white and black. The legs are brown and darker than the body. The hair around the muzzle and eyes is also brown but with a stronger rusty red colouring. The tail is bushy, whilst the tip of the tail, if coloured, is pale yellow or white. Their tail length equals their body length. Body length: 36‚Äì45 cm (14-17 inches) Tail length: 45 cm (17 inches), weight: 0.9-1.7 kg (2-4 lb). Males are significantly larger than the females. Indian grey mongooses are unusual in that they can discriminate four colours, more than most other mammals.  Distribution and habitat  It has been generally accepted that the Indian grey mongoose occurs in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, as represented by the distribution map. A 2007 study found specimens also in Turkey, and United Arab Emirates, thus extending the known range.Veron, G., Patou, M.-L., Pothet, G., Simberloff, D. and Jennings, A.P. (2007). Systematic status and biogeography of the Javan and Small Indian Mongooses (Herpestidae, Carnivora). Zoologica Scripta 36: 1‚Äì10. Despite being a common animal, the natural history of the Indian grey mongoose is not well known. They appear to be able to occupy a wide variety of habitats but preferring open types. These include grasslands, open areas, rocky patches, scrub, semi-desert, cultivated fields and other disturbed areas, areas of thickets, bushy vegetation, dry secondary forest, thorn forest, forest edges, and also near human settlement. Although the creature has been described as being less dependent on human settlements, observations in India in heavily forested areas show it to be much more common around human settlements often scavenging on waste. Taxonomy Ichneumon edwardsii was the scientific name proposed by √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1817. Subspecies: * H. e. edwardsi * H. e. ferrugineus * H. e. lanka * H. e. montanus * H. e. nyula Ecology and behaviour The Indian grey mongoose is omnivorous, though most of its diet is made up from live prey it catches from being an opportunistic hunter, with mice, rats, lizards, snakes, and beetles making up the bulk. Also eaten are ground birds, their eggs, grasshoppers, scorpions, centipedes, frogs, crabs, fish, and parts of plants: fruits, berries, and roots, as well as larger prey including hares and egrets. It kills prey by delivering a bite to the neck or head. The illustration of Indian grey mongoose and cobra This species is known for its ability to combat venomous snakes. It primarily achieves this through tiring the snake out, by enticing it to make multiple strikes which it acrobatically avoids. Secondary protection against the venomous bite includes the stiff rigid hair, which is excited at such times, the thick loose skin and specialised acetylcholine receptors render it resistant or immune to snake venom. When dealing with scorpions, no measures are taken to disable the sting, and they are picked up in any manner. The Indian grey mongoose typically opens eggs by holding them between the paws and biting a hole in the little end. Smaller mongooses typically open eggs by throwing them between their legs against a hard object, so it has been speculated, that the adult Indian grey mongoose should do likewise with large eggs. Inquisitive Indian grey mongoose pups at Lucknow Zoological Park. The Indian grey mongoose mates between March and October, it breeding two to three times each year. The gestation period lasts for 60 to 65 days, the female gives birth to two to four offspring. The lifespan of the Indian grey mongoose is seven years in the wild, or 12 years, when in captivity. Relation with humans The Indian grey mongoose is often kept as a pet to keep dwellings free from rats and other pests. The Indian grey mongoose is the state animal of Chandigarh. The species is protected in India, but an illegal trade in hair for the purposes of making of paint brushes and shaving brushes continues, and this is one of its most significant threats. About 3000 mongoose were killed to produce 155 kg. of raw mongoose hair, which were seized by Uttar Pradesh Forest Department and Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) in 2018. It is called Nevlaa in North Indian languages (Hindi/Punjabi), or in classical Hindi; in Marathi; in Telugu; , and in Kannada.

It runs east‚Äìwest in southwest Wisconsin from near Ferryville to Boaz. A section of the route was initially designated as WIS 131 in 1924, but it was not signed as WIS 171 until sometime between 1948 and 1956, when the highway was extended east to US 14 near Boaz. Route description Eastern terminus The highway begins at an intersection with WIS 35 east of Lake Winneshiek, a lake along the Mississippi River. From there, it runs eastward, following Copper Creek until it ends just west of Mount Sterling, where it intersects WIS 27\\\\. The highway then runs eastward before curving to the north to run along an unnamed creek, which the highway follows to the southeast until it drains into the Kickapoo River, at which point the highway crosses it to run along Main Street in Gays Mills. East of Gays Mills, the highway curves up a hill and runs eastward, running concurrently with US 61 for in Rolling Ground. From there, the highway runs eastward to meet an unnamed creek and the English Run before curving to follow a different tributary of the English Run. After that tributary ends, the highway intersects with County Trunk Highway (CTH) UU and then curves southeast to another unnamed creek which begins near CTH-F. The highway follows it until reaching CTH-E in Boaz, Wisconsin where it runs northward along Mill Creek before terminating at US 14. History In 1924, a route between Mount Sterling and Gays Mills was signed as WIS 131 and a route from Gays Mills to Boaz was signed as CTH-K. At the time, there was a western extension of WIS 131 to WIS 35 south of Ferrysville under construction. By 1925, the construction on the western extension was complete and the WIS 131 designation was extended north to Soldiers Grove. Sometime between 1948 and 1956, the route of CTH-K was signed as WIS 171 and the WIS 171 designation was extended along the former WIS 131 alignment to WIS 35.

For example, the guidelines of the Antique Automobile Club of America (AACA) are to \\"evaluate an antique vehicle, which has been restored to the same state as the dealer could have prepared the vehicle for delivery to the customer.\\" Restoration means removing, replacing, or repairing the parts of a vehicle, while preservation means keeping the original components. Though automotive restoration is commonly defined as the reconditioning of a vehicle \\"from original condition in an effort to return it to like-new or better condition,\\" There are many styles of which a vehicle can be restored, any of which can be performed at the discretion, desire, or taste of a vehicle owner or restorer. Styles Concours d'Elegance While the event known as Concours d' Elegance is an \\"invitation only\\" show of prestigious automobiles, the term \\"Concours d'Elegance Ready\\" Automobiles refers to the highest level of auto restoration. To term a restored car a \\"Concours d'Elegance Ready Automobile, or, \\"Concours Ready\\" for short, doesn't necessarily mean it will be exhibited and judged in Concours d'Elegance Events. The term is rather used to provide a comprehensive understanding of what level of automobile restoration has been completed on a car, or, what level of restoration on a car is underway by a very experienced Master Craftsperson in Automobile Restoration. This highest level of Restoration is distinguished from \\"Traditional Restoration\\" because a Concours Ready Car far exceeds the quality of the original manufacturer in its original debut day, because, the high standards set by judges at Concours D'Elegance events worldwide, demand that not a scratch or nick be found on even a single nut or bolt in the car being exhibited, as one example. A Concours d'Elegance level restoration means incredible handcrafting has gone into the lengthy and detailed restorative process, using minimalist filler, as another example of what separates this Arete Level of Restoration, from Traditional Automobile Restoration. Traditional Traditional restoration is characterized as returning a vehicle back to its original condition or better \\"in an effort to return it to like-new or better condition ... can be refurbished using either original or reproduction parts and techniques.\\" Traditional restorations can be performed with a focus to completely restore or to preserve as many original components as possible throughout the course of the restoration. Steve Segal, owner and restorer of a 1972 Pontiac Trans Am 455 H.O., explains the differences between the two methods when describing his project in a High Performance Pontiac magazine article: \\"'This was not a restoration in the traditional sense of diagnose and disassemble, bag and tag all part so you know where they go, if possible take a picture before you remove the part and put it in the part bag, strip them, sanitize them, fix them, repaint them, and put them all back together,' he says. 'It was a restoration with a preservation focus. It was done from an archaeological perspective. The ultimate goal was to put forth the maximum effort toward uncovering, referencing, documenting, and preserving any and all existing components and finishes.'\\" Muscle Car Restorations of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin also took a similar approach when performing the restoration of a 1969 Ford Mustang Boss 429 described in an article series published in Car Craft Magazine; \\"While not completely unmolested, it was very close. So much so that the decision was made to preserve as much of it as possible rather than to just tear it down, strip it, and start from scratch.\\" These levels of preservation of originality within antique vehicle restorations has proven to accrue more value than some fully restored vehicles at auction in recent years. The process of restoring some particularly rare antique vehicles back to their overall original showroom floor condition has become increasingly difficult over time due to the diminishing of resources, parts, and tools. Some parts may not be available to replace or to imitate via fabrication for some rare and antique vehicle unless proper research is performed. This is one reason why preservation has become such a primary objective in many restorations, particularly of rare antique vehicles, in order to preserve the historical aspects of the vehicle, its components, and the processes of its original assembly. Resto-modification Resto-modification, also known as resto- modding, is when \\"you take an old car and modernize it with an updated engine, suspension, brakes, tires and[/or] electronics. And if you resto-mod the right way, you can revert back to stock at any time.\\" Stock is \\"A vehicle that has not been modified and is in the same configuration as it came from the factory.\\" Various reasons for performing resto-modifications on vintage cars may include the owner's desire to have either modern conveniences, improvements in vehicle safety or reliability, and/or improvements in street or track-driving performance. Resto-modifications for modern convenience and safety may include adding features such as air conditioning, power windows, power steering, power brakes, seatbelts, or radio/stereo systems that may have not come installed on a vehicle at the time it was originally produced. An example of resto-modding is a 1970 Ford Torino Brougham 429 Cobra Jet owned and resto-modded by Kevin Young, published by Car Craft magazine. \\"‚Ä¶Young noticed some unusual valvetrain noise. While it turns out a set of lifters would've cured the problem, in the best hot rodder tradition, Young saw it as an opportunity to tear down the motor and build something better. The goal was a reliable, street-friendly, pump-gas engine that was capable of easy 12s on street tires, all the while retaining a factory restored appearance‚Äîincluding iron intake and exhaust manifolds.\\" Young accomplished this by doing a performance rebuild of the original engine and modifying the original differential, while preserving and/or restoring much of the car's other original components. According to Young, many enthusiasts were displeased with him and felt that his modifications compromised the originality of the extremely rare car, being one of three built like it. Though many enthusiasts within the auto restoration and preservation community feel this way about resto-modding, many others endorse it, such as TV personality and car collector Jay Leno: \\"Some purists object to changing or modifying these old cars. I look at it this way: If it makes the car better, safer, more reliable and faster‚Äîand you can change it back to stock whenever you want‚Äîwhy not do it.\\" Replicas A replica, re-creation, or tribute, is \\"A vehicle that has been modified to appear like another car or truck entirely, or like a more desirable version of that same vehicle.\\" Replica restorations are often performed by enthusiasts who want to imitate specific rare or famous vehicles, such as one from a particular movie or TV show. One such example is Trey Gee and his 1970 Pontiac LeMans published in High-Performance Pontiac magazine, which has been restored to replicate a much rarer Pontiac GTO Judge of the same year, a car which has recorded \\"auction sale prices [peaking] at well over $300,000.\\" Trey is quoted in the article saying \\"'I really wanted a classic GTO, but with the power, ride, and comfort to rival modern cars‚Äîa great car to drive. At the same time, I didn't want to heavily modify an original GTO or Judge and put lots of miles on it, because I would feel guilty for depreciating a piece of history, so I decided that a tribute car built as a resto-mod would be my best choice.'\\" Some individuals within the auto enthusiast community disapprove of replica restorations due to the prior cases in which some individuals performing said restorations, such as turning a 1967 Pontiac LeMans into a replication of a Pontiac GTO of the same year, a rarer model, and fraudulently selling it advertised as the rarer and more sought after model with the higher price tag. Preservation of exterior wear Preservation of exterior wear is characterized as leaving an antique car's body and paint unrestored and in an 'as-is' condition, or by preserving patina. Patina describes a vehicle's exterior which has \\"a natural finish that embraces the years of wear, tear, and repair a vehicle has earned during decades of service.\\" Vintage vehicles with patina are often \\"Valued for their originality and historical significance, not for the quality of restoration.\\" David Gooding, founder and president of Gooding & Company classic car auctions describes patina as \\"the fingerprints of the manufacturers there, and the owner. You look at a car with great patina and you know it has a character like nothing else. It's got a personality, a unique personality, and when you see those cars get restored ‚Äì they just totally lose it. It all gets cleansed and cleaned off and buffed and then it's just like everything else, and back down to a level.\\" Examples of this style of preservation/restoration include Steven Henderson's 1928 Ford Model A published in Hemmings Motor News magazine, along with Matt Tucker's 1960 Ford F-100 published in Diesel Power magazine. Henderson bought his '28 Ford with 80 years of body and paint wear but decided only to bring the vehicle back to running condition and left the exterior as it was. Henderson's reason for doing so, according to him, was in order to preserve its character and originality. Tucker bought his '60 Ford pickup with decades of wear and discoloration, but according to him, he decided it was best to preserve its imperfection by covering it with a preserving clear coat. Mechanical Process A complete restoration includes not only repair of the parts that can be seen ‚Äì the body, trim, chrome, wheels, and the passenger compartment ‚Äì but also the components that are not necessarily visible or otherwise evident, including the engine and engine compartment, trunk, frame, driveline, and all ancillary parts like the brakes, accessories, engine cooling system, electrical system, etc.Restoration Topics: 200 Articles on popularrestorations.com - retrieved on September 16, 2010 Repairs are made to correct obvious problems, as well as for cosmetic reasons. For example, even if a wheel is covered by a full hubcap and not seen, and is structurally sound, it should have the tire unmounted and any required repairs performed such as rust removal, straightening, priming, and painting. Disassembly A complete auto restoration could include total removal of the body, engine, driveline components and related parts from the car, total disassembly, cleaning and repairing of each of the major parts and its components, replacing broken, damaged or worn parts and complete re- assembly and testing. As part of the restoration, each part must be thoroughly examined, cleaned and repaired, or if repair of the individual part would be too costly, replaced (assuming correct, quality parts are available) as necessary to return the entire automobile to \\"as first sold\\" condition. All of the parts showing wear or damage that were originally painted are typically stripped of old paint, with any rust or rust related damage repaired, dents and ripples removed and then the metal refinished, primed and painted with colors to match the original factory colors. Wooden parts should go through the same meticulous inspection and repair process with regluing, replacement of rotted or termite-damaged wood, sealing and refinishing to match the factory specifications. Pressure treatment with preservative may be considered to safeguard against future wood rot. Chrome and trim may require stripping and repair/refinishing. Fasteners with tool marks, damaged threads, or corrosion need re-plating or replacement-unless the car was originally sold that way. The frame must be thoroughly cleaned and repaired if necessary. Often abrasive blasting of the frame is the most expeditious method of cleaning, but it may still leave microscopic rust pitting behind, so should be followed up with a phosphoric acid 'rust killer' solution, before priming. Abrasive blasting using less abrasive soda or crushed walnut shells is less likely than sandblasting to cause damage to fragile items, while still removing corrosion. Acid tank dipping of the frame and or body followed by an E-coat primer after repairs is recognized as the most effective but also most expensive way to get rid of rust and to protect against future corrosion. The chassis frame should be properly coated for rust protection to at least match the standard of the original, to the highest modern standard would safeguard the time and money invested in the restoration. Interior The interior of the vehicle should be examined and repaired or replaced to match those that were available from the factory. The seats must be repaired before being re- upholstered and the coil springs repaired, replaced, or retired. The instrument panel or dashboard contains a number of gauges, each of which has to be inspected and cleaned, repaired, or replaced to be brought back to both operational and cosmetic standards of the car when it was first sold. Developments in technology have made it possible to salvage the original automobile's interior by various restoration processes. Examples of this include leather seat, dash, console, steering wheel, door panel, and trim repair, as well as re-dyeing. Exterior Apperson: Before and After In a complete restoration, the repair and refinishing of the car's body and frame must again go through the careful inspection and subsequent repair and recoating as necessary to bring the car to as first sold condition. As part of the automotive restoration process, repair of the car's frame is important since it serves as the foundation for the entire car. The frame should be inspected for straightness, twisting, alignment, rust damage, stress fractures, collision damage and condition of the mounting points for the body, suspension, and other components. Any problems must be repaired, which can be a costly process. For many popular cars, replacement frames can be purchased from parts suppliers specializing in that make of vehicle. This is often a better option than investing money into a severely damaged frame. Depending on the frame construction, mud and water can make their way inside the frame and cause rusting from the inside out, so it can be seriously weakened with little or no external sign. This, and the fact that many replacement chassis/frames are galvanised, provides sound additional reasons to consider a replacement frame. If rust is present on a body panel, the panel was damaged by a collision, or other damage is present, there are several options for repair: fix the damaged panel (minor damage), replacement (excessively damaged panels), or cutting out and replacing a portion of the panel (moderate damage - for many makes of vintage car, small partial patch panels are available and designed to be welded into place after the damaged portions are cut out). Although this may seem simple in principle, in practice it is highly skilled work. One of the highest skills in restoration is the use of the English Wheel or Wheeling Machine to fabricate complete compound curvature panels from scratch. Many panels, (especially if from different sources), may be a problem to fit together and need reshaping to fit together properly. Variation in panel size and shape and 'fettling' by skilled metalworkers on the factory production line to make panels fit well used to be common practice, especially with British and Italian sports cars. Even genuine New Old Stock factory panels may require panel beating skills to fit. The re-installation of the repaired or renewed panels requires that the panels be trial fitted and aligned, to check their fit, that their shape 'flows' and the gaps between panels are correct. Consistent gaps are very important to a quality finish. Gapping gauges are available for this. The doors, hood, and trunk should open and close properly, and there should be no interference or rubbing. Steel or aluminum door skins and wing/fender edges can generally be adjusted with a hammer and dolly, in extreme cases a pulsed MIG weld bead on a panel edge, that is shaped with a grinder and file, can be a good solution. At one time it was common practice to use lead loading to achieve tight panel gaps, especially in the coachbuilding business, but also on the production line. Lead loading is highly skilled and requires safety precautions because ingested lead or fumes are toxic. The panels have to 'look right' together. This is a process of repeated adjustment because the adjustment of one panel often affects the apparent fit of another. If there are multiple styling lines on the side of a car, it is generally best to align doors on the most prominent one. When the panels on the car are satisfactory, they should be primed and painted a correct historical color for the vehicle if the restoration is striving for historical accuracy. An owner might want to have the car painted to look like a particular specialty vehicle such as a police car, or a delivery van painted to look like it would have in grandfather's company colors, etc. Individual painting of the panels is generally the correct approach, as this will result in all parts of the panel being painted as opposed to partially re-assembling and then painting, leaving parts of the assembly that are touching or \\"blind\\" unpainted. It is useful to mark in some way, if possible, where the panels fit before removal for painting, to aid re- fitting. The separate painting approach should also result in no overspray on other parts of them since they will not be in the car at that point. It is important when re-assembling painted panels to be aware that the paint is at its thinnest, and most easily damaged on corners, edges, and raised styling lines, and to take extra care with them, such as temporarily taping with masking tape. This is also important when using ultra fine wet flatting paper before polishing, (or when using an electric polishing mop) for the best mirror-like finish. Colors and treatments applied to the panels from the factory should be considered. Although more original looking, period enamel or cellulose paint will be less capable of protecting the car bodywork than modern paints. A car's owner may wish to have a panel or portion of the car entirely painted when in fact it may have come from the factory with undercoating or other coating applied to one side, which may be less attractive than a smoothly finished and painted panel. In other cases, the owner might paint or plate a collection of small parts to look similar for a better appearance, when the factory might have installed these as many different colors since the factory's prime concern was a balance between function and cost and not the appearance of unseen areas. Given the cost of restoration, it makes sense to many owners to upgrade the corrosion protection of paints, underseals, and anti-rust waxes to far above the original factory standard to protect the time and money invested in the restoration. Some owner's feel these improvements would make the car a \\"Restomod\\", and not a restoration. The term \\"Restomod\\" is not used in the UK. Mechanicals Boss 302 engine The entire engine and all related systems are inspected and whatever is necessary to get them into original presale condition is done. The engine and all of the ancillary components ‚Äì starter, generator/alternator, radiator, distributor, carburetor and all others ‚Äì must be inspected and corrected to factory specifications. The engine itself, plus the transmission, clutch, overdrive unit, and even the driveshaft must be meticulously inspected, cleaned, and measured for wear. This will show up as a deviation from original factory specifications. All of the parts ‚Äì block, crankcase, head, transmission housing, etc. ‚Äì should be inspected for cracks or other damage. All moving parts ‚Äì pistons, crankshaft, camshaft, oil pump, bearings and bushings, flywheel, water pump and all others ‚Äì must be cleaned and measured against factory specifications and, if necessary, machined or re- manufactured to bring them within specifications. The same goes for the transmission, clutch, differential and all other moving parts of the power line and driveline. All of the electrical systems have to be inspected and, if it shows chafing, wear or damage, replaced. If the car is old enough to have used rubber or even fabric-based electrical wiring insulation, this should be replaced even if looks okay and upgraded to modern insulation because it is a fire risk. Then the entire engine/driveline will have to be reassembled, replacing all worn bearing and bushings, seals, gaskets, belts and gears.

Restoration of a car is a daunting task, not one to be undertaken lightly, or by the inexperienced. A full restoration can take many years and can cost tens of thousands of dollars; often, and generally, well in excess of what the finished value of the car will be. Many jobs will have to be farmed out to specialty shops; those with the special knowledge and equipment to do the job. Often a restoration once started is left unfinished and the car and parts can be purchased for a fraction of their worth. However, if a person buys an unfinished project, it is imperative to be sure that all of the parts are there. Finding parts for an orphan or rare car can sometimes be impossible. This necessitates the fabrication of parts from scratch, generally at great effort and expense. There are different levels of automotive repair. The highest quality level, generally unobtainable for the amateur restorer, is the Concours d'Elegance level; these are cars that are frequently restomoded to a degree often beyond the quality that they were when they left the factory. There are virtually no deficiencies in the quality of the parts that were actually restored. Those parts that did not come on the car as it was first sold must have the highest level of fit and finish, and appear to have been original parts. Many Concours cars are not driven except for the short distances from their trailers to the show field. Only when a car is completely placed back into the condition it was first sold in is it considered to be restored. Various aspects of a car may be repaired without the car being restored. A car that does not run can be repaired to running condition, but that simply means it will now run and does not mean that any part of the car has been restored. Automotive Restoration means that the car was put back into the condition it was first sold as. Anything else is either repair or resto-mod. Between these two extremes are the vast bulk of cars that are seen as drivers, neighborhood show cars, and 20-footers - in that they look great from away. Many value guides offer six levels of quality, from a \\"parts-only\\" car to the best at \\"Number 1\\" - absolutely perfect in every way. For the amateur, or even experienced restorer, there are a great number of help sources, books, and magazines (Skinned Knuckles in the US or Practical Classics in the UK, for example) to assist with restoration of an entire car or specific parts. There are also enthusiast websites that can offer helpful advice and contacts for vehicle restoration. Ground-up restoration There are many restoration facilities in existence offering a broad range and quality of services. Some businesses focus their work on only specific components, such as engines, gas tanks, clocks, or chromed parts. Others perform complete restoration or remanufacture of virtually any car including any of its components. This includes restoration to a finished factory level or better-than-factory condition. Some businesses have the capacity to restore and fabricate all components in-house coupled with the ability to recreate a car no matter what state of decay it is in (or literally how much of the car remains, sometimes as little as a single fender remains and nothing else). There are also restoration services provided by the original manufacturers, such as Ferrari and Aston Martin. Upgrades In the U.S. a non-original restored car may be termed a \\"restomod.\\" Upgrades may include newer safety components such as seat belts, brakes or using relays to reduce electric current flowing through light switches. Usability upgrades such as fitting intermittent wipers, an alternator instead of a dynamo, or electronic ignition system instead of contact breaker points ignition system. Emissions upgrades such as hardened valve seats to use standard unleaded fuel, or retrofitted catalytic converters. Upgrades that are easily reversible to the original condition, or were available when the vehicle was current, would be less likely to be controversial. Less acceptable to the classic car market may be major alterations like engine swaps or gearbox transplants, which would be more like hot rodding. Depending upon how appropriate the upgrades are considered by other owners of the same model, this may reduce or enhance the value of the car. If the car is in regular use non-original upgrades would be likely to be more acceptable, than if the car is a stored collector's piece where originality would be more important. It is important as a restorer or owner, to know what is acceptable to the potential market for the finished car, in order not to de-value it.

It operates bus service in three cities within Denton County, as well as the A-train, a regional commuter rail line to Carrollton. History DCTA was created in accordance with House Bill 3323, under Chapter 460 of the Texas Transportation Code, approved by the 77th Texas Legislature and signed into law by the Governor in 2001. On November 5, 2002, the voters in Denton County approved the confirmation of DCTA by 73%. The DCTA Board of Directors represents every geographic area of the county. In 2006, DCTA absorbed LINK, the mass transit service operated by the City of Denton since 2002. LINK's bus routes were absorbed into DCTA's local Denton services (now called Connect). Paratransit services in the three member cities were also absorbed and renamed DCTA Access. Neither Lewisville nor Highland Village (the other current members of DCTA) operated bus lines prior to DCTA's formation. Member cities The following cities voted to join the DCTA on September 13, 2003 and levy a half cent sales tax to finance the system. *Denton *Highland Village *Lewisville No other cities have joined the DCTA since its inception, and none of the original cities have elected to withdraw. Board of directors The Denton County Transportation Authority is governed by a 14-member board appointed by respective entities: *Three members are appointed by \\"small cities\\" (population ‚â§ 17,000) *Eight members are appointed by \\"large cities\\" (population > 17,000) *Two members are appointed from unincorporated areas of the county *One member represents the county at-large Although a DCTA Board member must reside in Denton County, the member does not have to reside in a DCTA-member city. All members serve two-year terms. Board members must have professional experience in the field of transportation, business, government, engineering or law. In accordance with DCTA By-laws, the Board adopts the annual operating budget and is responsible for setting policy. The president oversees the day-to-day operations of the DCTA and implements policies set forth by the Board. Transportation services The Denton County Transportation Authority offers several services to the general public in the Greater Lewisville and Denton area. These services include fixed-route service in Denton and Lewisville, an on-demand service in Highland Village, shuttle routes serving UNT and NCTC, and a regional commuter service connecting Denton, Lewisville, Carrollton, and downtown Dallas. Additionally, DCTA offers demand response/paratransit service in Denton, Lewisville, and Highland Village. Connect Connect at Downtown Denton Transit Center DCTA Connect offers local fixed-route services operating in the cities of Lewisville and Denton. The routes were configured to provide easy access to many destinations within these cities. DCTA currently operates nine routes in Denton (numbered 1 through 9), three routes in Lewisville (numbered 21 through 23), and an on-demand service called Connect RSVP in Highland Village. College shuttles DCTA also operates seven shuttles that serve University of North Texas students: *Mean Green *North Texan *Discovery Park *Eagle Point *Bernard Street *Colorado Express *Centre Place DCTA also operates a shuttle service for Denton and Lewisville commuting students to the North Central Texas College Corinth and Flower Mound, TX campuses.

This species has a dark brown body and its legs are noticeably in black colour. The tail length is two-thirds of its body length and more furry than that of the small Indian mongoose. A pointed tail and fur beneath the hindleg help to distinguish this species from others.

In the 1970s, it has been introduced to Fiji, where it lives in sympatry with the Javan mongoose.  Behaviour and ecology  The Indian brown mongoose is nocturnal in nature, prefers to live in isolation, and maintains its habitats in dense forests. When ready to breed, Indian brown mongooses burrow in densely-packed rocks and give birth to two to three young. The brown mongoose is carnivorous, feeding primarily on small rodents, reptiles and at times also on birds.

Taxonomy Ichneumon javanicus was the scientific name proposed by √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1818. In the 19th and 20th centuries, several zoological specimens were described, which are now considered synonyms: *Mangusta auropunctata by Brian Houghton Hodgson in 1836 was a specimen collected in central Nepal. *Herpestes exilis by Paul Gervais in 1841 was a specimen from Tourane in Vietnam. *Mangusta pallipes by Edward Blyth in 1845 were mongooses observed in Kandahar, Afghanistan. *Mungos rubifrons by Joel Asaph Allen in 1909 were eight adult specimens collected around Wuzhi Mountain in Hainan Island, China. *Mungos exilis peninsulae by Ernst Schwarz in 1910 was a skin and a skull of a mongoose collected in Bangkok. *Mungos siamensis by Cecil Boden Kloss in 1917 was a skin of an adult female mongoose collected in northern Thailand. *Herpestes palustris by R. K. Ghose in 1965 was an adult male mongoose collected in a swamp on the eastern fringe of Kolkata, India. Today, the following Javan mongoose subspecies are recognised: * H. j. javanicus * H. j. auropunctatus * H. j. exilis * H. j. orientalis * H. j. pallipes * H. j. palustris (Bengal mongoose) * H. j. peninsulae * H. j. perakensis * H. j. rafflesii * H. j. rubrifrons * H. j. siamensis * H. j. tjerapai  Phylogeny  Analysis of mitochondrial DNA revealed that the Southeast Asian group of Javan mongoose subspecies differs genetically from the Javan mongoose occurring farther west. The Salween River in Myanmar is probably a barrier between the two groups. Description The body is slender and the head is elongated with a pointed snout. The length of the head and body is . The ears are short. The feet have five toes and long claws. Sexes differ in size, with males having a wider head and bigger bodies. The Javan mongoose can be distinguished from the sympatric Indian grey mongoose (H. edwardsii) by its somewhat smaller size. It is larger in the east of its range, where the Indian grey mongoose does not occur, and shows a stronger sexual dimorphism, with the males being larger than the females. Distribution and habitat The Javan mongoose is native to the north of the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia, and has been introduced to Hawaii, the Bahamas, Cuba, Croatia, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, the Lesser Antilles, Belize, Honduras, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, Colombia, Suriname, Venezuela, Guyana and Mafia Island. It lives in a broad diversity of habitats.Hays, Warren ST, and Sheila Conant. \\"Biology and impacts of Pacific Island invasive species. 1. A worldwide review of effects of the small Indian mongoose, Herpestes javanicus (Carnivora: Herpestidae).\\" Pacific Science 61.1 (2007): 3-16. Introduction to Hawaii Javan mongoose in Hawaii In the 1800s sugar cane plantations shot up on many tropical islands, including Hawaii, Fiji and Jamaica. With sugar cane came rats, attracted to the sweet plant, which caused crop destruction and loss. Attempts were made to introduce the mongoose in Trinidad in 1870 to control the rats, but this failed.Hoagland, D. B., G. R. Horst, and C. W. Kilpatrick (1989) Biogeography and population biology of the mongoose in the West Indies. Pages 611‚Äì634 in C. A. Woods, editor. Biogeography of the West Indies. Sand Hill Crane Press, Gainesville, Florida, USA. A subsequent trial with four males and five females from Calcutta, however, established the species in Jamaica in 1872. A paper published by W. B. Espeut that praised the results intrigued Hawaiian plantation owners, who, in 1883, brought 72 mongooses from Jamaica to the Hamakua Coast on the Big Island. These were raised and their offspring were shipped to plantations on other islands.Espeut, W. B. 1882. On the acclimatization of the Indian mongoose in Jamaica. Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London 1882:712‚Äì714. Accounts from the sugar industry in the early 20th century state that the introduced mongooses were effective at reducing the number of rats, mice, and insects. However, the mongooses have been deleterious to native birds, which evolved in the absence of mammalian predators, as well as preying on the eggs of endangered sea turtles. Only the islands of Lana'i and Kaua'i are thought to be free of mongooses. There are two conflicting stories of why Kaua'i was spared. The first is that the residents of Kaua'i were opposed to having the animals on the island, and when the ship carrying the offspring reached Kaua'i, the animals were thrown overboard and drowned. A second story tells that on arriving on Kaua'i one of the mongooses bit a dockworker, who, in a fit of anger, threw the caged animals into the harbor to drown. Introduction to Caribbean Starting in 1870, the Javan mongoose was introduced to Jamaica, Cuba, Hispaniola, and St. Croix, to prey upon black rats (Rattus rattus) that were ravaging the sugarcane industry. Another reason for introducing the mongoose was to reduce snakes in the cane fields. While successful in reducing sugarcane damage from rats, the introduction had a negative impact on reptiles and other animals. The green iguana (Iguana iguana, also believed to be an introduced species) has been greatly reduced in number, and the ground lizard Ameiva polops was eliminated from the island of St. Croix before 1962 (but not from Protestant Cay, Green Cay, Ruth Cay, and Buck Island). Ground-nesting birds may also have been affected, as well as rock iguanas and mammals native to the region, such as hutias and solenodons. Introduction to Okinawa The mongoose was introduced onto Okinawa Island in 1910 and Amami ≈åshima Island in 1979 in an attempt to control the population of the venomous snake Protobothrops flavoviridis, an endemic species, and other pests, but they have since become pests themselves.\\"The Small Asian Mongoose introduced to the Island of Okinawa and Amami-Oshima: The Impact and Control Measure.\\" Science Links Japan.

Males can potentially become sexually mature at the age of 4 months. Javan mongooses eat mostly insects but are opportunistic feeders and will eat crabs, frogs, spiders, scorpions, snakes, small mammals, birds and eggs.

On Okinawa, the Javan mongoose may carry antibiotic-resistant strains of E. coli. In studies where traps were used in an attempt to remove the mongoose, it was found that the trap success was nearly zero during rain.Nellis, D. W., and C. O. R. Everard. 1983.

Genetics The introduced populations show genetic diversification due to drift and population isolation. Populations on islands throughout the world have increased in size and sexual dimorphism, resembling populations in the east of their range where they have no ecological competitors. Invasive species Mongoose introduction was very successful in rat control, but the mongoose also hunts reptiles, birds and bird eggs, threatening many local island species. It has also been extremely successful regarding its second purpose in getting rid of snakes; on many of the Caribbean islands where it was released the native snakes have been extirpated and now only exist on offshore islands, at least one species from St. Croix in the Virgin Islands may now be extinct. In 2016, the European Commission put the mongoose on the list of invasive alien species in the EU.

Lower court judges were initially appointed by the President of Venezuela in combination with an administrative arm of the Court, but during the 1969-74 term of Rafael Caldera, the opposition-dominated Congress moved appointment powers to a Judicial Council with representatives of all three branches of government, but with a legislative majority.Crisp, Brian F.

Named after Thomas Sparrow, landowner, it was the site of a very large industrial complex owned by Bethlehem Steel, known for steelmaking and shipbuilding. In September, 2018, Amazon opened a fulfillment center on the property. History Sparrow's Point was originally marshland home to Native American tribes until being granted to one Thomas Sparrow Jr. (1620 - 1674) by Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, around 1652. His son Solomon Sparrow made a home there, calling it \\"Sparrow's Nest\\". In the 1700s the area became home to other families, who farmed and raised crops, building homes and hunting lodges. Among the many wealthy residents of Baltimore who owned property there was Major General George H. Steuart, who hosted the social reformer Dorothea Dix at Sparrow's Point.Sjoberg, Leif, American Swedish (1973) Retrieved January 2012 By the 1860s much of the land, about , was owned by the Fitzell family.Helton, p.7 Retrieved January 2012 Sparrow's Point remained largely rural until 1887, when an engineer named Frederick Wood realized that the marshy inlet would make an excellent deep- water port for the Pennsylvania Steel Company. The Fitzells were reluctant to part with their peach orchards but were eventually persuaded to sell. Following World War II, many rural economic migrants settled in Sparrows Point, coming from Southern and Appalachian states. These migrants came to work at the Bethlehem Steel plant. Many of these white workers were from rural areas and mining towns of West Virginia and Central Pennsylvania. Steel Steel was first made at Sparrow's Point in 1889 by the Maryland Steel Company, a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Steel Company. By the mid-20th century, the Sparrow's Point waterfront plant was the world's largest steel mill, stretching from end to end and employing tens of thousands of workers. It used the traditional open hearth steelmaking method to produce ingots, a labor- and energy-intensive process. Bethlehem Steel Corporation of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, purchased the mill in 1916. The mill's steel ended up as girders in the Golden Gate Bridge and in cables for the George Washington Bridge, and was a vital part of war production during World War I and World War II. The mill was served by four railroads: the Western Maryland; Pennsylvania; Baltimore & Ohio; and the local Patapsco & Back River Railroad, which was responsible for yard work. By 1961, the mill was producing of steel per year. Changes in the steel industry, including a rise in imports and a move toward the use of simpler oxygen furnaces and the recycling of scrap, led to a decline in the use of the Sparrow's Point complex during the 1970s and 1980s. From 1984 through 1986, an effort to modernize resulted in the successful installation of a basic oxygen furnace (BOF), continuous caster and supporting management information systems. However, this effort to save the plant and Bethlehem Steel was, perhaps, too little too late. The Sparrow's Point plant was owned by Mittal Steel following its acquisition of Bethlehem Steel's successor company International Steel Group in 2005, after Bethlehem's bankruptcy. In March 2008, Mittal Steel sold the plant to the Russian company Severstal for $810 million. In 2012, the Sparrow's Point steel mill was purchased along with other mills in Ohio and West Virginia by Renco Group for $1.2 billion. This made Renco the fifth owner in the past ten years. RG Steel, LLC, a unit of Renco, ran the facility until it filed for bankruptcy on May 31, 2012. In September 2014, the property was purchased by Sparrows Point Terminal, LLC (SPT). SPT entered into agreements with the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under which SPT agreed to develop and execute plans to complete environmental cleanup of the site. The agreements require SPT to establish a $43 million trust fund and provide MDE with a $5 million letter of credit to ensure that the cleanup work is completed (but the company remains obligated to complete the remediation work in accordance with those agreements, even if the cost exceeds $48 million). SPT also agreed to provide the EPA with $3 million to perform additional offshore investigation and, if necessary, offshore remediation. Both the purchase of the property by SPT and the company's agreements with MDE and USEPA were hailed by government and business leaders as a positive turning point for Sparrows Point. Maryland's Secretary of the Environment, Robert M. Summers, described the agreements as providing a \\"clear path to completion\\" of the environmental cleanup and an \\"extraordinary level of protection for the environment and public health.\\" Viewing the environmental cleanup as the first step toward major economic revitalization for Sparrows Point and the surrounding region, Baltimore County Executive Kevin B. Kamenetz stated that \\"the future for returning thousands of family- supporting jobs to Sparrows Point looks brighter than it has in many decades.\\" According to one of SPT's executives, the company's plans for redevelopment include transforming the site into \\"one of the largest ports on the East Coast\\". Ships The Sparrow's Point Shipyard site was a major center for shipbuilding and ship repair. Maryland Steel Company established the Sparrow's Point yard in 1889, and it delivered its first ship in 1891. Bethlehem Steel Corporation acquired the Sparrow's Point shipyard in 1917. During the mid- twentieth century, Bethlehem Steel Shipbuilding (BethShip)'s Sparrow's Point yard was one of the most active shipbuilders in the United States, delivering 116 ships in the seven-year period between 1939 and 1946. During the 1970s, Bethlehem Steel invested millions of dollars in upgrades and improvements to the Sparrow's Point yard, making it one of the most modern shipbuilding facilities in the country. This included the construction of a large graving dock to allow for the construction of supertankers up to in length and (gross) in size. Bethlehem Steel lurched from one financial crisis to another throughout the 1980s and 1990s, selling the Sparrow's Point yard to Baltimore Marine Industries Inc., a subsidiary of Veritas Capital, in 1997 as part of an unsuccessful restructuring attempt. Baltimore Marine operated the facility as a ship repair and refurbishment yard until 2003, when Baltimore Marine Industries collapsed in bankruptcy. The Sparrow's Point shipyard complex was sold at auction to Barletta Industries Inc. in 2004. Barletta is attempting a redevelopment of the site for use as a business and technology park, and plans to revive shipbuilding on at least part of the site, making use of the modern graving dock added in the 1970s. Liquefied natural gas In 2007, the international energy company AES Corporation applied to the federal government for a certificate to build and operate a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal at Sparrow's Point. The AES Sparrow's Point LNG development would consist of three 160,000-cubic meter storage tanks and vessel offloading systems for LNG tankers. AES would also construct a new natural gas pipeline, the Mid-Atlantic Express, which would run north from Maryland into Pennsylvania, crossing under the Susquehanna River to connect with existing natural gas pipelines. The buried pipeline would be long. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved the project in January 2009, over the objections of state and county officials in Maryland and Pennsylvania. FERC chairman Jon Wellinghoff cast a dissenting vote, stating that in his opinion the region‚Äôs energy needs could be better met without including LNG in the mix. The Maryland Department of the Environment denied Sparrow's Point a water-quality permit that would allow the company to dredge in Baltimore Harbor. A citizens' group, the LNG Opposition Group, also opposes the project. In popular culture *The steel plant is seen in the episode \\"Ebb Tide\\" of the television series The Wire, where character Jimmy McNulty mentions that his father once worked there. Sparrow's Point is also mentioned in a folk song by Richard Shindell, as one site where unemployed men gathered prior to gaining their next job as soldiers in World War II.

Life He came from a Derbyshire family. He graduated B.A. on 12 July 1572, at Balliol College, Oxford and, in the same year, was elected probationer fellow of his college. Before going to Oxford, he matriculated in 1566 at St John's College, Cambridge. According to Anthony √† Wood, he owed his fellowship to the influence of Robert Parsons, but Wood's editor, Philip Bliss, contradicts him;Bliss printed in the footnotes to the life of Parsons (Athen. Oxon. ii. 657) a letter of Archbishop George Abbot to Dr. Hussye, from which it appears that Bagshaw 'coming to be fellow was most hot in prosecution against Parson.' connecting Bagshaw with the expulsion of Parsons from the college. On 21 June 1575, Bagshaw took the degree of M.A. At this time, he was a strong if quarrelsome Protestant. About 1579, he became Principal of Gloucester Hall, where he made himself very unpopular. He resigned this office and, in 1582, went to France. Here, he became a convert to Catholicism and was made a priest. Then, with the permission of Cardinal William Allen, he was admitted to the English College, Rome; but his temper made him so unpopular that he was expelled by Cardinal Boncompagni. On leaving Rome, he returned to Paris, where he became a doctor of divinity at the Sorbonne. Jesuit writers styled him derisively doctor erraticus and doctor per saltum. He went to England as a missioner and, in 1587, was imprisoned in the Tower of London. In 1593, he was confined with other Catholics in Wisbech Castle. He clashed with Father William Weston, who found him disobedient, setting off the \\"Wisbech Stirs\\". When examined at the Tower for treasonable practices, Edward Squire, an emissary from some English priests in Spain, affirmed that he had come with a letter (which he threw into the sea off Plymouth) from Father Henry Walpole to Bagshaw at Wisbech. After his liberation, Bagshaw continued to reside abroad. In 1612, he held a disputation with Daniel Featley concerning transubstantiation.Notes of this disputation were printed many years afterwards in Transubstantiation exploded, or an Encounter with Richard, the titularie Bishop of Chalcedon. ... By Daniel Featley, D.D. Whereunto is annexed a publique and solemne disputation held at Paris with Christopher Bagshawe, D. in Theologie and Rector of Avie Marie College, 1638.

Works Bagshaw published, at Paris in 1603, 'An Answer to certain points of a Libel called An Apology of the Subordination in England,' 8vo. He is also thought to have been concerned in *'Relatio compendiosa Turbarum quas Jesuit√¶ Angli una cum D.

Plot summary This novel is a direct follow-up to The Poisoners. It is also the first book in the Matt Helm series to focus on Helm's superior, Mac, whose full name is revealed for the first time as Arthur McGillivray Borden. The storyline of this book is rather uncharacteristic because, instead of fighting terrorists and enemy names, Helm, known as Eric, and Mac work together to bring down unfriendly elements from within their own government, in particular a man who is threatening Mac's authority. Fishing in the Gulf of California, Eric is shot at from an island. He races away, surprised at the power of the engine of his boat. Correctly calculating that his assailant had come in another boat from the same marina, he waits for the gunman to try to escape, swamps his boat, and tows it back to shore, leaving the gunman to drown. At the marina, he is met by Martha Borden, Mac's daughter, who was sent by Mac with a message to call the office. Doing so, he deduces that bureaucratic infighting has resulted in Mac being poorly impersonated and the agency co-opted. Martha tells him she is supposed to accompany him to meet agent Lorna at the ranch near Phoenix. Eric, Lorna, and Martha meet and discuss the other information that Martha has memorized to pass along: nine other agents, with contact numbers, a list of individuals to be \\"touched\\" and a date. Matt is to take his souped-up boat to meet Mac in Florida, stopping in Oklahoma to deal with a situation involving Carl, who will split the list of ten targets with Lorna. Carl is killing local law enforcement officers for personal, understandable reasons. Eric and Martha arrive in Fort Adams, Oklahoma, and Eric contrives to prevent Carl from killing a third police officer, briefs him on the situation, and gives him his assignment. They continue on to Florida, and along the way, fall into bed together. In Florida, Eric and Martha meet Congressman Hank Priest. a friend and shore neighbor of Mac's, who arranges for Eric to listen in on a private conversation that evening, at his home a short distance away. Having observed how naive and idealistic Martha is, as she was distressed by having seen him leave his would-be assassin to drown in the Gulf of California, and his blunt assessment of Carl's actions and motives in Oklahoma, after arriving with her, by car, at the residence, he pretends to be rendered unconscious when she injects him with a hypo of plain water, not the. four-hour knockout drug she saw him use on the Oklahoma officer. He knows she thinks she has negotiated her father's safety in exchange for keeping Eric from interfering with the last part of the enemy plan. Mac is hiding from the new leader of the federal intelligence service, a previous antagonist named Herbert Leonard who is in collusion with Senator Love, a woman who aspires to the presidency and is using Leonard to blackmail and kill those who stand in her way. Eric let Martha overhear Mac's location and steal the congressman's boat in order to gather the final clues he needs to follow her and take care of his targets. 1972 American novels Matt Helm novels ","title":"The Intriguers"},{"id":"6433980","text":"Zuchwil is a municipality in the district of Wasseramt in the canton of Solothurn in Switzerland.

The murders have popularly, albeit inaccurately, been cited as an inspiration for the horror film The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Kleasen's conviction was later overturned and Kleasen immigrated to the United Kingdom, where he remarried and was eventually imprisoned on gun violations. Kleasen died in the UK while fighting extradition back to the US for retrial on the murder charges. Early life Robert Elmer Kleasen was born on September 20, 1934 in Buffalo, New York. He was the only child of a store clerk and his wife. Guns and hunting were a passion of the boy as well as his mentally ill father. In 1950, 16-year-old Kleasen stepped on a rusty nail while hunting in the woods and his mother took him to the hospital. While waiting impatiently for doctors to see him, he hit his mother, got a gun from her car, and returned to the emergency room shooting. No one was hurt, but the outburst landed him in a psychiatric facility until 1952. In 1971, a year after gaining a sociology degree, he shot off a man's toe in a dispute. He later jumped bail in the state and moved to Texas. Texas Upon arrival in Austin, Texas, Kleasen made a multitude of wild claims to his acquaintances, most notably that he was a Korean War veteran and former CIA operative. He also used several aliases, at least one of which has been speculated to have been a dissociated personality. Kleasen was baptized into a local congregation of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In December 1973, he was arrested for rustling bison and became angered when the church didn't send a lawyer to get him out of jail. After his release, members of Kleasen's church became increasingly uneasy with his behavior. Two Mormon missionaries, Gary Darley (20) and Mark Fisher (19), routinely visited Kleasen, who lived in a trailer behind a taxidermist's shop in Oak Hill, on Austin's southwestern outskirts. Despite being warned by their bishop to stop their visits due to Kleasen's behavior, Darley and Fisher decided to see Kleasen one final time. On October 28, 1974, Darley and Fisher disappeared in Oak Hill. Police investigation of the disappearance led to the scenario that the missionaries were shot dead after having agreed to meet Kleasen for dinner. Police discovered Fisher's bloody watch and bullet-punctured name tag in Kleasen's trailer but bodies never were found. Investigators also discovered blood and tissue on a bandsaw in the taxidermy shop where Kleasen worked. Prosecutors at Kleasen's 1975 murder trial alleged he dismembered the victims and buried the remains. Kleasen was believed to have held a grudge against the LDS Church after he felt church members did not support him during a poaching trial. Kleasen was convicted and sentenced to death. But in 1977, after two years on Texas' death row, an appeals court overturned Kleasen's conviction. The appeals court ruled that the search warrant for his home was improper and that key evidence should have been excluded. Authorities opted to not retry Kleasen. Immigration to the UK After his release from Texas prison, Kleasen relocated to New York, where he was later imprisoned on assault charges. He lived for a time in a Buffalo, New York charity mission. He drew attention from the local media, and police had to be posted near the mission for Kleasen's protection. He only congregated with the other people living in the mission during church services prior to eating. During this time, the local Buffalo TV channels updated the story every night on their news broadcasts. In 1990, Kleasen moved to Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, England. He married local woman Marie Longley, who he met as a pen pal while living in the US. He ingratiated himself with local residents, and began to amass a huge gun collection. A firearms license officer became suspicious of Kleasen's claims of being a decorated military veteran and CIA agent, and confirmed from U.S. military officials that Kleasen had never served in the U.S. armed forces. This information was passed on to police, resulting in a more thorough background check on Kleasen. English authorities learned of Kleasen's U.S. murder conviction, which he had unlawfully omitted from his residency application. The investigation also uncovered several gun law violations. He was given a three-year prison term in 2000 for possession of illegal firearms and munitions and began to serve time in an English prison. His wife found out about his criminal background and at one point, Kleasen threatened her with death if she tried to leave him. Being too scared to leave she stayed for almost a decade, only to come up with an escape plan with a close friend. His wife was briefly considered a missing person, possibly killed by Kleasen, until authorities learned she had fled her home during the investigation into his gun law violations. Extradition battle and death In 2001 while imprisoned in the UK on the guns violations, Texas authorities began the process of extradition. DNA analysis and other forensic tools were used to obtain new evidence in the 1974 murders of Darley and Fisher, specifically by matching Darley's DNA to blood found near Kleasen's residence . Extradition was agreed in principle subject to the UK requirement of binding assurances not to impose the death penalty. Before he could be extradited, Kleasen died on April 21, 2003 of heart failure. He was 68 years old. Media Ken Driggs wrote a book about the murders, Evil Among Us: The Texas Mormon Missionary Murders. The book was published by Signature Books, a Salt Lake City, Utah company that specializes in Mormon-related topics. Kleasen was the subject of a 2003 British documentary titled The Real Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

It tells the story of Beatrice (Sarah Polley), a journalist whose fianc√© is killed by a monster in Iceland. The story is based very loosely on the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf.Hartley p. 126. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the May 2001 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Beatrice (Sarah Polley) is a young woman working in a television network under a woman known only as The Boss (Helen Mirren). She receives a recording from her fianc√© Jim, who has been sent as part of a small production crew to Iceland to investigate a Monster that lives there. Determined to find her fianc√©, Beatrice convinces her boss to send her to Iceland, but her plane crashes. She is the only survivor and, in order to walk again, undergoes an extremely painful, radical surgery. As she recovers, she befriends Dr. Anna (Julie Christie), who helps her travel to the remote village where the monster lives. After cajoling Beatrice into drinking herself into unconsciousness, the villagers strip her and leave her as an offering to the Monster himself (Robert John Burke), a foul-mouthed, alcoholic beast old enough to remember human ancestors crawling from the seas. Beatrice shows him no real fear, although the Monster tells her he has killed her friends and might kill her, too. He tells her that he wants to die, but is indestructible. In an effort to force Beatrice to try to kill him, he proves that he killed Jim and his crew. She shoots him twice and he reacts in obvious pain, but heals almost instantly. He tells her of a mad scientist, Dr. Artaud (Baltasar Korm√°kur, presumably named for Antonin Artaud), who had discovered a way to kill him, but Dr. Artaud had been \\"taken away in a strait jacket.\\" Beatrice offers to help him find Dr. Artaud if the Monster comes with her to New York and promises not to kill anyone while he is there. In New York the Monster becomes a celebrity, with the Boss staging a media frenzy as they search for Dr. Artaud. They find that he is working for the government. While Beatrice revels in the attention, the Monster remains miserable and drunk. The Boss makes a deal with a government scientist to study the Monster and he's rushed away by army guards who mislead him into believing he is going to see Dr. Artaud. Instead, he is subjected to torturous experiments as the scientists try to discover the key to his indestructibility, one of them noting that he can't seem to tolerate new information. One of those experiments involves the Monster being ridiculed and beaten on the street to study his behavior. The Monster holds true to his promise to Beatrice and does not kill anyone. Meanwhile, Beatrice meets Dr. Artaud by chance. With Margaret (Annika Peterson), a remorseful former coworker of Beatrice's, they hatch a plan to escape back to Iceland with the Monster. They make their escape, but are pursued by the government, who fears the Monster and Artaud might fall into the wrong hands. Artaud builds a machine that will kill the Monster. Beatrice bids the Monster a tearful farewell, and kisses him goodbye. As the machine starts, the army storms their hideout. As the lights flicker on and off and the machine moves the Monster into place (in a process mirroring Beatrice's surgery), the Monster and Beatrice face each other one last time. Her face flickers in his vision for several minutes before the screen blackens.

It was shot in Iceland and New York City during September and October 2000. It was the first Hartley production for a major company, MGM/United Artists, and Francis Ford Coppola was one of the executive producers. The film was ill-received at the Cannes Film Festival, after which the studio demanded the movie be recut. Hartley refused, and Coppola supported him. These events, and the September 11 attacks, complicated the relation with the studio. The release, in early 2002, was a low-key affair; after two weeks, only three screens showed the film. It went to home video within months.Rawle, p. 84. In 2012, the film's screenplay was made available on Hal Hartley's website in a book that also included the screenplays for The Book of Life and The Girl From Monday. Critical reception No Such Thing was poorly received by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 30% based on 43 reviews with the consensus: \\"Stocked with talented stars but lacking any clear idea of what to do with them, No Such Thing is ultimately far too uneven to recommend.\\" Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film one star, saying \\"No Such Thing is inexplicable, shapeless, dull. It doesn't even rise to entertaining badness.\\"Roger Ebert, 'No Such Thing', in Your Movie Sucks, pp. 211--213. In the assessment of E. L. Risden, No Such Thing is 'a marvelous and under-appreciated cinematic revision of the Anglo-Saxon epic'; 'the satire of No Such Thing focuses not on our remnant fear of traditional monsters, but on our numb-headed failure to fear the functional monsters our large and exploitative corporations can become‚Äîand on those of us who allow them (by watching them or paying them or simply not resisting them) to do so.'E. L. Risden, 'A Corporate Neo-Beowulf: Ready or Not, Here we Come', in Corporate Medievalism, Studies in Medievalism, 21 (Cambridge: Brewer, 2012), pp. 49--56 (pp. 49 and 50).

The Russell Library is a department within the University of Georgia Libraries that reports to the University Librarian. The Russell Library is a charter member of the Association of Centers for the Study of Congress.Member Directory, Association of Centers for the Study of Congress History  Founding  During the 1960s representatives of the University of Georgia Libraries corresponded with Senator Richard B. Russell, Jr. on several occasions about donating his papers. In 1969 a group of Russell's friends persuaded him that a foundation should be established to document his life and career. In June 1970 the Richard B. Russell Foundation was incorporated under the laws of the state of Georgia. After the senator's death in 1971, the Russell Foundation and its first chair, U.S. senator Herman E. Talmadge, raised a significant endowment to establish the library and to fund a Russell Chair in American History at the university., The Russell Chair in American History. Working with the University System Board of Regents and University of Georgia officials, the foundation trustees agreed to locate the Russell Library on the ground floor of the university's main library, with its own entrance. In 1974 the executors of the Russell estate turned over the Russell collection to the foundation, which then transferred it to the university. The Russell Library was dedicated in June 1974. The library's original mission was to collect and preserve materials that document the life and career of Richard B. Russell, United States senator from Georgia from 1933 to 1971. Since then it has expanded to serve as a repository for papers of individuals and organizations predominantly related to Georgia politics.  New building  The first special collections department at the University of Georgia was established in 1953. In the years since, the original collection - now the Hargrett Rare Book and Manuscript Library - has grown and the Richard B. Russell Library for Political Research and Studies and the Walter J. Brown Media Archives and Peabody Awards Collection. In January 2010, UGA President Michael Adams, members of the Russell Foundation, the family of the late Senator Richard B.

Exhibits Dedicated to sharing information about Georgia's modern political life and culture, the Russell Library develops exhibits that engage with the past, present, and future. Visitors can explore interactive kiosks with access to oral history interviews, historical film, video, and sound recordings. Artist Art Rosenbaum's mural Doors is a centerpiece of the Russell Library exhibit space, featuring a panoramic view of Georgia's past and present. The exhibit space features a replica of the office of Senator Richard B. Russell, Jr. It provides a representation of the senator's Washington office that includes much of his original furniture, photographs, books, and memorabilia.Office of Senator Richard B. Russell exhibit The curatorial staff at the Russell Library researches, develops, and fabricates exhibits in consultation with scholars and community experts. The Russell Library also develops online exhibits to complement exhibits on physical display in the gallery space. The exhibits are open during normal business hours, and group tours are available every Tuesday at 2 p.m. and upon request. Collections Library holdings complement course work in history, political science, international affairs, social sciences education, sociology, law, journalism, speech communication, economics, and environmental studies. Research strengths include the U.S. Congress, national defense, foreign policy, civil rights, jurisprudence, agricultural economics and land use, public works, and public policy formation.

History In a restricted and specific sense, expeditors or expeditioners are laymen approved by the Dataria, after an examination, to act as agents for bishops or others before the Dataria or Apostolic Chancery. They are members of the Roman Court. They differ from solicitors as well as from procurators or agents in general, who transact business with the Roman Congregations. A solicitor, strictly speaking, is an assistant to a procurator, doing the mechanical work of preparing documents. An expeditor is more concerned with matters of favour, privileges, dispensations and so on, than with cases in litigation. It has been the practice of the Dataria and Apostolic Chancery to carry on business only with authorized agents or expeditors, whose office it is to draw up and sign the necessary documents, receive and forward the answer given. They receive a certain fixed fee for each transaction, while procurators and solicitors generally receive a monthly stipend. The number of expeditors has varied. Cardinal Pacca, pro-datarius, decided in 1833 that the number, which was then one hundred, should be regulated by the amount of business to be transacted. Circa 1900 there were about thirty.

These have included the performance of Christmas plays such as Duffy and the Devil or St George and the Turkish Knight and traditional Cornish dance, music and song. Historical description Guise dancing was observed in the late 19th century by Cornish antiquarian M. A. Courtney who reported that the practice had been largely eliminated by 1890 in Penzance due to a decline in the traditional nature of the celebrations and a rise in anti-social behaviour, the practice however could be found in St Ives, Newlyn and Mousehole St Ives finally ceasing in the 1970s. Mummer's Day in Padstow is considered by many to be the last form of traditional Guise dancing left, but is distinguished by the use of different music and the lack of masks, which are replaced by blackened faces. Masks are the most notable feature of Guise dancers both historic and modern with \\"Bal masqu√©\\"Edmondes, Richard :from the Transcripts of the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society 1851 being a common type of mask on display, animal masks, and plainer masks also present. William Bottrell in his book Traditions and Hearthside Stories of West Cornwall (1870‚Äì80) describes in detail the guise dancers in Penzance, including their traditional costume. Modern Guise dancing Processional Guise Dancing at the Montol festival 2008 There has been a rise of interest in Guise Dancing in Cornwall in recent years with new groups adopting the practice throughout Cornwall. The most notable being the Turkey Rhubarb band in Penzance, The St Ives Guisers and Pyba. The Turkey Rhubarb band and Pyba both regularly appear with 'Obby 'Osses, Penglaz and Pengyn respectively, both of which are the \\"Skull and pole\\" variety. Penglaz of course being most famous for its appearances at the Golowan festival in late June accompanied by the Golowan band.Reed, Simon \\"The Cornish Traditional Year.\\" Troy Books 2009 Modern guise dancing can be divided into roughly three types of activities, firstly, large processional \\"carnival\\" parades which hundreds or even thousands take part, secondly smaller more intimate performances in public houses and the like and thirdly, bands of Christmas players who perform the Christmas plays described above. Many of the tunes now performed as part of Guise dancing are taken from the canon of Cornish traditional tunes and dances collected in the 1970s and 1980s by Merv and Alison Davy and others. Most modern Guisers dress in \\"mock posh\\" costume or hand me downs decorated with ribbons and tatters. Masks of all types with the exclusion of modern fancy dress masks and the like are common. Guise dancing is practised as part of the St Ives feast celebrations and forms the main part of the Montol Festival in Penzance. BBC recording Guise dancers pictured in the 1970s in St Ives On 5 January 1935, the Madron Guise Dancers performed for the BBC's Regional Programme Western. From the programme's description: > Twelfth Night, for instance, is the last day when one may meet with the > Guise Dancers on their rounds and tonight we may expect a visit from the > people of Madron, near Penzance. In December 1937, the BBC made a recording for the BBC Regional Programme at Landithy Hall in Madron of the plays and music associated with Guise dancing. It was performed by the Madron Guise Dancers. However this recording has subsequently been lost. Performances associated with this practice include 'St George and the Turkish Knight' and 'Duffy and Devil.' Each performance allegedly ended with the 'Turkey Rhubarb' dance, the origins of the name of this dance are not known but may relate to the herb of the same name.

It is the only member of the genus Ichneumia.  Taxonomy  Herpestes albicaudus was the scientific name proposed by Georges Cuvier in 1829 for a mongoose specimen with a white tail from Senegal. Characteristics The white-tailed mongoose attains a weight range of , with an average of approximately , has a head-and-body length of and a tail length of . On average it appears to be the longest and heaviest extant species of mongoose, although its linear and body mass parameters broadly overlap with other larger mongoose species, in particular, the marsh mongoose seems to most closely rival (and possibly match) in range of body masses reported if not average weight.Gittleman, J.

Comparative ecology of two African forest mongooses, Herpestes naso and Atilax paludinosus. African Journal of Ecology, 35(3), 237-253. Its legs are relatively long for a mongoose. The head is long and narrow. Its large, rounded ears are set low on the sides of the head. It has a yellow to tan coloration on its body, with long black guard hairs, giving it an overall grizzled grey appearance. Distal from the tibiofemoral joint, the legs are black. The base of the large, bushy tail is brownish yellow, and on its distal half, the tail is white . This appendage may comprise up to 40% of the creature's body length. This species lacks hair on its upper lip and on the forepaws. Females have four teats. Distribution and habitat The white-tailed mongoose lives in most of Africa south of the Sahara, and the southern portion of the Arabian Peninsula. It lives in a wide range of habitats, from semi-desert to savanna woodland, but avoid moist areas like the Congo River basin or extremely arid areas. It prefers areas of thick cover, such as the edges of forests and brushy streams.Dewey, T. and N. Greene. 1999. Ichneumia albicauda at Animal Diversity Web. Accessed June 14, 2010. In the East Sudanian Savanna, it was recorded in the transboundary Dinder‚ÄìAlatash protected area complex during surveys between 2015 and 2018. Further northeast, it is also frequent in the Degua Tembien massif.  Behaviour and ecology  The white-tailed mongoose is primarily nocturnal and terrestrial. By day they will rest in an abandoned burrow, termite mound, or in cavities under tree roots. The average home range is 0.97 km¬≤ for males and 0.64 km¬≤ for females. Ranges of males do not overlap, but ranges of opposite sexes overlap significantly. Females either live alone with their own offspring or in a small group with other females and their offspring, although they do not associate with each other. Though they may share a range, they forage separately. They are, for the most part, solitary creatures, with the male and female only coming together to mate. Reports of groups are either a breeding pair or a mother and her offspring. These mongooses do not migrate except to establish their own territory away from their mother's range. These mongooses are very vocal, and make an unusual barking sound that is associated with sexual behavior. If frightened, they will secrete a noxious substance from their anal glands. They do not stand on their hind feet for any length of time like other mongooses. Diet The white-tailed mongoose feeds mostly on insects, but will feed on a wide variety of other foods as well. Locusts, beetles, and mole crickets make up the majority of their diet. Rats, mice, shrews, lizards, snakes, small birds are also eaten, along with the occasional fruits and berries. The eggs of birds are also eaten; they will break open the egg by throwing it between its hind legs against a rock or other hard object. They have been known to raid chicken houses in areas where domestic poultry is raised. Reproduction Knowledge of the reproduction of the white tailed mongoose is incomplete. Litters are seen most frequently from February to May, and no young appear at all during the dry season from August to November, which suggests that they only breed once a year. The young are fully weaned at nine months of age, and around this time, the young disperse. It is speculated that sexual maturity is reached before two years of age, and that the gestation period is around 60 days. Etymology The genus name, Ichneumia, is derived from the Greek ichneumon, which means 'tracker'. This name also happens to be the species and common name for the Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon). The species name, albicauda, is derived from the Latin words albus, meaning 'white', and cauda, which means 'tail'. Local and indigenous names In Tigrinya language, it is called ·çÇ·àí·à´ (').

Robin Kettering had been purchased from Robin Line of the Seas Shipping Co., Inc. some four months after launch and served as a commissioned ship for five years and four months. On 12 September 1946 the ship was transferred to the War Shipping Administration and placed in reserve until repurchased by Seas Shipping for operation as Robin Kettering. In 1957 the ship was sold, renamed Flying Hawk operating in cargo‚Äîpassenger service until sold for scrap in 1971. Construction Robin Kettering was the third of three geared turbine, modified C2-S type ships for the Seas Shipping Company's Robin Line by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation at its Bethlehem Sparrows Point Shipyard, Maryland yard under a Maritime Commission contract. The ships had sequential MC and yard hull numbers: Robin Locksley 72/4341,According to the MARAD Vessel Status Card Robin Locksley was delivered to the War Shipping Administration 28 February 1942 and was operated under an Army Transportation Corps agreement by Seas Shipping Company until 31 May 1944 when the agreement was changed to a WSA general agreement. The ship was redelivered to the company 30 April 1946. 73/4342, and Robin Kettering 74/4343. One of the modifications for these ships was increased length, approximately that of the C3 type, no bow or stern sheer and a flat, broad funnel. The last ship's keel was laid on 19 June 1940 with launchd on 18 January 1941 sponsored by Mrs. William Sanford Lewis. The ship was delivered on 29 May 1941 and registered with official number 240632. As built the ship was , , length overall, length between perpendiculars, beam with a depth of and a draft of .

Two steam turbines drove a single screw propeller of diameter. The turbines were rated at 6,300 shp and driving the propeller at 85 rpm, they could propel her at a normal service speed of , with a maximum speed of . Naval service On 31 May 1941 the ship was purchased by the Navy from the Robin Line of the Seas Shipping Co., Inc., of New York City; commissioned as Alhena (AK-26) at Hoboken, N.J., on 15 June 1941, Comdr. Charles B. Hunt in command. Service history Following final fitting out and shakedown training, the cargo ship began operating among ports on the East Coast of the United States. The ship arrived at Boston on 13 December to take on cargo for NS Argentia, Newfoundland. She completed her run to that port by the end of December and then proceeded to Brooklyn, N.Y., to refill her holds. =Voyage to Europe= She picked up more cargo at Norfolk, Va., in mid-January 1942 and returned to New York City to embark troops before getting underway on 5 February for Europe. On the next day, the ship was officially assigned to the Naval Transportation Service. After touching at Halifax, Nova Scotia, Alhena reached Belfast, Northern Ireland, on 27 February and remained there for approximately two weeks discharging her passengers, equipment, and supplies. She made a stop at Clydebank, Scotland, on 14 March and sailed two days later for the United States. The vessel reached New York on the 25th. =Assigned to the Pacific= The ship departed the east coast on 9 April, bound for the Canal Zone; transited the canal on the 19th; and set her course for the Tonga Islands. She reached Tongatapu on 9 May; landed Army and Navy personnel; left that island two weeks later; and arrived at San Diego, California, on 5 June. While in port, the vessel underwent repairs and alterations before taking on marines and equipment for transportation to the South Pacific. =Assault on the Solomon Islands= On 1 July, Alhena got underway for Tongatapu. Upon her arrival there, she was assigned to Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet. A few days later, the vessel sailed to the Fiji Islands to participate in amphibious landing exercises in preparation for the American thrust into the Solomon Islands in which United States forces would take the offensive for the first time in World War II. After completing the exercises, she sortied with Task Group (TG) 62.1 for Guadalcanal, arrived off that island on 7 August, and began unloading operations. In spite of heavy enemy air attacks, the ship carried out her task successfully and got underway on the evening of the 9th for Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, where she arrived the next morning. The ship took on another load of cargo; set out for the Solomons on the 20th; reached Tulagi two days later; and began discharging sorely needed supplies. She meanwhile took on casualties and prisoners of war for evacuation to Espiritu Santo and reached that island on 24 August. =Hit by a torpedo= During the next month, Alhena carried out a series of supply runs between Espiritu Santo and Efate, New Hebrides. This pattern of operations was interrupted on 24 September, when she left Espiritu Santo bound for the Solomons. She moored off Guadalcanal on the 26th and began a routine of unloading her cargo ashore during the day and retiring seaward each night. The work proceeded successfully in spite of heavy Japanese air harassment until the task was completed on the 29th and the vessel sailed for Espiritu Santo. At 2354, a torpedo from the Japanese submarine I-4 struck the ship in the area of the number five hold and caused extensive damage in the after part of the ship. The attack killed four crewmen, wounded 20, and left one crewman and over 25 Marines (being evacuated to a hospital) missing. Fires broke out but were quickly brought under control. The crew constructed temporary bulkheads out of sheets of plywood and other lumber to fill up the holes. She was unable to make any headway and drifted throughout the night and the next day. came alongside on 1 October and took Alhena in tow. The tug relieved the destroyer the next day, and continued on toward the New Hebrides with the cargo ship in tow. They reached Espiritu Santo on the 7th, and work began on temporary repairs to the ship. On 16 October, Navajo once again took Alhena in tow and headed for New Caledonia. They reached Noumea on the 20th, and the repair work continued until 8 November when she got underway towed by the seagoing tug Navajo over 2500 miles for Australia. She reached Sydney on 20 November and remained there until the following June undergoing final repairs and conversion to an attack cargo ship. =Reconfigured as attack cargo ship= As a result of her new configuration, the vessel was redesignated AKA-9 on 26 November 1942. Finally, over eight months after being torpedoed, Alhena returned to duty in the South Pacific. She left Sydney on 10 June 1943 and shaped a course for Noum√©a. During the next few months, the ship was engaged in runs between Noum√©a and Guadalcanal and also made port calls at Auckland, New Zealand, to take on cargo. In late October and November 1943, Alhena took part in operations on November 1Bougainville, the largest of the Solomon Islands. Although taken under enemy attack several times, Alhena discharged her troops and supplies without sustaining any damage. She made 2 more re- supply runs to Empress Agusta Bay, Bougainville in December 1943 and January 1944. =Saipan= Following this operation, the ship resumed her runs between Noum√©a and Guadalcanal and continued that duty until departing Guadalcanal on 24 March 1944, bound for Hawaii. Following a stop at Funafuti, Ellice Islands, en route, she reached Hawaii on 9 April. Throughout April and May, Alhena conducted maneuvers and loading operations in Hawaiian waters in preparation for the impending assault on Saipan. She departed Honolulu on 30 May with troops of the 2nd Marine Division embarked, bound via Eniwetok for Saipan. Alhena arrived off Saipan on 15 June and began debarking her troops. Despite undergoing two air attacks while unloading, she completed the process on the 23d, left the area, touched at Pearl Harbor on 4 July, and pushed on the next day toward the California coast. The ship entered San Francisco Bay on the 11th and, shortly thereafter, began a three-month period of overhaul. Explosion of the in Seeadler Harbor, Manus, Admiralty Islands, 10 November 1944. Small craft gathered around the during salvage and rescue efforts shortly after Mount Hood blew up about away from Mindanao's port side. Mindanao, and seven motor minesweepers (YMS) moored to her starboard side, were damaged by the blast, as were the Alhena (top left center) and , (top right). Note the extensive oil slick, with tracks through it made by small craft. =The Philippines= The work was finished in early October, and Alhena got underway on the 13th bound for the Admiralty Islands. She reached Manus on 29 October. While at anchor in Seeadler Harbor waiting to discharge her cargo, she was damaged by the explosion of ammunition ship at 0855 on 10 November. Three of her crew members were killed and 70 were wounded, 25 of them seriously. Alhena herself suffered extensive damage above decks which necessitated some six weeks of repair work. The ship resumed action in mid- December and participated in the invasion of Luzon at Lingayen Gulf in January 1945. She then sailed to Ulithi to take on cargo and moved thence to Guam to embark troops of the 3rd Marine Division. =Iwo Jima= The USS Alhena in company with Task unit 51.1.4 anchored off the eastern beaches of Iwo Jim at 0920, 27 February, and commenced unloading operations. These operations were substantially hampered throughout the entire period by the northeasterly swell, which caused damage to this vessel and craft loading alongside, in addition to creating a shortage of lighterage by limiting operations at the beach. Cargo consisted of 10 officers and 225 enlisted men of the 3d Marine Regiment 3d Marine Division, vehicles, petroleum, rations, clothing, water, and ammunition. Only one percent of total cargo was unloaded prior to 1813 hours, at which time night retirement was made with transport vessels of various units as designated by the Commander Joint Expeditionary Force. Retirement was continued without incident and return to anchorage was made at 0817 hours, 28 February, at which time unloading was recommenced. Unloading operations were interrupted by an air raid warning at 0130 hours, 1 March, during which smoke was made for a period of one-half hour. Unloading was secured and night retirement commenced at 1730 hours in company with units of the Joint Expeditionary Force Reserve. During both night retirements boats were left behind. After an uneventful night the ship was anchored at 0809 hours, 2 March, and unloading again commenced. During the afternoon LSM 260 was brought alongside with considerable difficulty, but before unloading could be started it was recalled by Commander Task Group 51.1. LSM 145 secured alongside just before operations were suspended at 2122 hours by an air raid warning during which smoke was made for fifteen minutes. The LSM stayed alongside during this interval, and unloading operations were resumed immediately upon securing from battle stations. At 0958 hours, 3 March, anchor was weighed and course set for anchorage off the western beaches of Iwo Jima where the vessel anchored at 1036 hours and resumed unloading under appreciably better sea conditions. Thirty-three percent of total cargo had been unloaded up to this time. A beach party consisting of one officer and ten men was sent ashore to augment the small force at the newly established beach. Unloading continued until 1020 of 4 March, at which time all equipment of forces landed or to be landed had been sent ashore. During the remainder of the day the ship's platoon was disembarked, a staff communication organization was taken aboard from two units of the fire support group, and eleven casualties were received from the beach. Boats were dispatched to unload vessels carrying Garrison Group Zero. At 2340 reloading of certain THIRD MARINES equipment was commenced, which was completed at 0334 hours, 5 March. The remainder of this day was spent in regaining control of boats dispatched the previous night, recovering beach party, and exchanging operative boats for the imperative boats of LSD-2. Departure from the area was made at 1748 hours in company with Transport Division THIRTY-THREE less USS Hercules (AK-41), plus USS Whiteside (AKA-90). =Okinawa= Having discharged her embarked troops and equipment, the ship left the Volcano Islands and proceeded to Noum√©a. Alhena remained in port there for nearly two months in reserve for the Okinawa invasion. In late May, she steamed to Leyte to replenish her supplies. From early June through the end of the war in September, Alhena operated between Manila, Philippines, and various ports in New Guinea carrying troops, supplies, and equipment. Among her ports of call were Finschhafen, Hollandia, and Oro Bay, New Guinea. =Post-war activity= On 13 October, Alhena entered Tokyo Bay. She operated in Japanese waters supporting American occupation forces through 19 November. On that day, the ship departed Yokosuka, Japan, bound for the United States. The cargo vessel paused at Seattle, Washington, before sailing on to San Francisco. After remaining in port through the Christmas holidays, she got underway on 6 January 1946 for the Far East. The ship made port at Okinawa on 22 January and soon continued on to Tsingtao, China. After discharging her cargo there, she left Chinese waters on 2 March, bound for the United States. Alhena arrived at San Francisco on 18 March and underwent a period of voyage repairs. She set sail on 12 April and shaped a course for the east coast. After transiting the Panama Canal, the cargo ship arrived at Norfolk on 1 May. One week later, she moved on to New York City. Alhena was decommissioned there on 22 May 1946, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 15 August 1946. She was transferred to the War Shipping Administration on 12 September 1946. Alhena earned six battle stars for her World War II service. Guadalcanal-Tulagi landings, 7 to 9 August 1942, Marianas operation Capture and occupation of Saipan, 15 to 23 June 1944, Capture and defense of Guadalcanal, 29 September 1942, Luzon operation Lingayen Gulf landings, 9 January 1945. Treasury-Bougainville operation Occupation and defense of Cape Torokina, 1 and 13 November 1943, Iwo Jima operation Assault and occupation of Iwo Jima, 9 March 1945. Alhena was awarded the Combat Action Ribbon (retroactive - 29 September 1943, October‚ÄìNovember 1943, 15‚Äì23 June 1944). Civilian operation Upon transfer to the War Shipping Administration on 12 September 1946 the ship, again Robin Kettering, entered the Hudson River Reserve Fleet, staying there until brought out briefly (24 March to 1 April 1947) under a general agency agreement with former owner Seas Shipping Company. On 16 October 1947 Seas Shipping repurchased the vessel operating it until 1957. Robin Kettering Robin Kettering and the five sister C2-S ships composed the Robin Line's Robin Lockley Class cargo liners. Twelve passengers were accommodated in outside double cabins and inside single cabins with private bathrooms. The full width of the ship in the cabin area had a dining room flanked by verandah lounge areas.See photos and passenger area plan in referenced brochure. In May 1948 Robin Kettering departed Erie Basin, Brooklyn, to begin service around Africa into the Indian Ocean. A Seas Shipping brochure effective 1 June 1954 shows the ports from New York to be Walvis Bay, Luderitz, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London, Durban, Louren√ßo Marques, Beira, Dar-es-Salaam, Tanga, Zanzibar, Mombasa, Tamatave, Majunga, other Madagascar ports, and Mauritius. Flying Hawk The Robin Line, operating twelve ships, was sold in 1957 with eight ships acquired by Moore McCormack Lines with four, including Robin Kettering, acquired for operation by American Export Lines. Seas Shipping had contracted with Moore McCormack on 1 March 1957 to sell the twelve Robin Line ships for $17 million with two specific vessels excepted, either one or both, from the sale at the option of the buyer. The two vessels were Robin Kettering and Robin Doncaster. On 11 April 1957 Moore McCormack exercised the option to exclude both vessels. Seas Shipping then sold each vessel to independent third parties.The two excepted ships were unique among the C2-S ships in one respect which may account for the exception. They both had undergone extensive modifications for war service by the U.S. Navy and British Ministry of War Transport. Vessel Status Cards for the other four show they were operated by the War Shipping Administration. Conversion to cargo-passenger service for the two modified ships thus would probably cost more. Robin Kettering was sold to Flying Hawk, Inc., renamed Flying Hawk which was then sold in July 1962 to American Export Lines in which Isbrandtsen Company Inc., of New York had acquired a controlling interest.The MARAD status card tracks ownership of the hull. This appears to be a case in which a holding company taking the name of the ship owned the hull which was operated by a shipping line. That line operated the ship along with Flying Endeavor, Flying Fish, and Flying Gull as \\"Special C-2 type freighters\\" for 120 day \\"'Round-World voyages\\" accommodating twelve passengers maintaining the passenger area configuration of the Robin Line. Disposal In March 1971 the ship was sold for scrap to a foreign company.

The Tigris and Euphrates rivers both have their sources in the Armenian Highland, hence, the land of Iraq and the land of Armenia have always been connected. Today it is estimated that there are around 10,000‚Äì15,000 Armenians living in Iraq, with communities in Baghdad, Mosul, Basra, Kirkuk, Baqubah, Dohuk, Zakho and Avzrog.\\"Iraq: Tiny Ethnic-Armenian Community Survived Hussein, Making It In Postwar Times.\\" RFE/RL. July 6, 2004. Armenians make up the second largest solely Christian ethnicity in the country, after the indigenous Assyrians. History Armenian children in Baghdad, 1918 The history of Armenians in Iraq is documented since late Babylonian times. However, the general roots of the contemporary Armenian community in Iraq can be largely traced to Shah Abbas's forced relocation of the Armenians to Iran in 1604, some of whom subsequently moved on to settle in Iraq.Dekmejian, R. Hrair (1997). \\"The Armenian Diaspora\\" in The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times, Volume II: Foreign Dominion to Statehood: The Fifteenth Century to the Twentieth Century, ed. Richard G. Hovannisian. New York: St. Martin's Press, p. 427. A further 25,000 Armenians arrived in Iraq during the early twentieth century as they fled the persecution of the Armenian Genocide. They established schools, athletic and cultural clubs, and political and religious institutions in urban centers across the breadth of Iraq.Hovannisian, Richard G. \\"The Ebb and Flow of the Armenian Minority in the Arab Middle East,\\" Middle East Journal 28 (Winter, 1974), p. 28. During the 1980s, the Armenian community flourished as a result of President Saddam Hussein's modernization efforts, as it continued to rebuild its cultural institutions and even consecrated an imposing cathedral in Baghdad. Saddam retained many Armenians among his personal entourage: his nanny was Iraqi-Armenian, along with one of his body guards, his jeweler, tailor, and housestaff.Cockburn, Andrew and Patrick Cockburn. Saddam Hussein: An American Obsession. London: Verso, 2002, pp. 5, 160. One of his mistresses was Juliet N. Gurjian. The Armenians benefited under the secularist rule of the Baath party, which strongly suppressed the Islamist forces especially the Shiite Iraqi elements that would later rise against Saddam. The Armenians also did not support anyone in the opposition so the Hussein regime count on their loyalty and consequently grant them many rights. During Christmas, Saddam Hussein would order large amount of flowers to be taken to the Baghdad Armenian church. Armenians and the political situation After the launch of the second Iraqi campaign, more than 3,000 Armenians left the country, head of National Management of Armenians in Iraq Paruyr Hakopian stated. ‚ÄúFour years have passed since the launch of military campaign in Iraq by Coalition forces. And I confirm with certainty that the number of Armenians who have immigrated abroad does not exceed this mark,‚Äù he noted. Mr. Hakopian said four years ago there were 18,000 Armenians in Iraq and now only 15,000 of them live in the country. Generally during the past 4 years 1,500 Armenians immigrated to Syria, about 1,000 arrived in Armenia and about 500 departed for Jordan,‚Äù he stressed.28 Armenians died during 4 years in Iraq. PanArmenian.net. March 24, 2007. Many Armenians served in the military during Iraq's eight-year war with Iran and the Persian Gulf War. More than 130 from Zakho (a town with an Armenian population 1,500-strong) were killed in the conflict with Iran while three others, also from Zakho, were killed in coalition air strikes in Kuwait, Basra, and Mosul. Civilian casualties in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War, following the rebellion by the Kurds, included four Armenian babies who died in fighting near the Turkish border.Fisk, Robert. The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2006, pp. 685-86. 2003 invasion of Iraq With the invasion of Iraq, the situation for Armenians in Iraq worsened considerably. Armenians have been subject to killings and kidnappings for ransom. Many Armenians have immigrated to other Middle Eastern countries (most notably Syria and Lebanon), Europe, the US, Canada, and Australia. Armenian churches have also been target of bombings by paramilitary groups. In October 2007, two Armenian women in Iraq were killed by the Australian private security contractors, Unity Resources Group, in Almasbah district in Baghdad. The Armenian winner of the Miss Iraq competition went into hiding out of fear of being targeted by Islamic militants.\\"Iraq's beauty queen fears for life after threats to pageant.\\" USA Today. April 12, 2006. Deployment of Armenian troops Armenia took part in the efforts of the US-led Coalition by sending a group of 46 non-military personnel, including 30 truck drivers, 10 bomb detonation experts, three doctors and three officers. They served under the Polish command in the city of Karbala and the nearby town of Hillah. In October 2008, Armenia ended its modest presence in Iraq, citing improved security and the ongoing withdrawal of a much larger Polish army contingent that has supervised Armenian troops deployed in the country.\\"Armenia Ends Iraq Mission .\\" Asbarez. October 16, 2008. Religion Armenians in Iraq are mostly members of the Armenian Apostolic Church (also known as Armenian Orthodox) or Armenian Catholic Church. St. Gregory the Illuminator Armenian Apostolic Church (at Younis al Sabaawi Square, Baghdad) is the main church for the Armenians of Iraq. There is also the Saint Vartan Armenian Apostolic Church in Dohuk, northern Iraq. Avak Archbishop Asadourian is the Primate of the Armenian Apostolic Diocese in Iraq since April 1980. The Armenian Catholic Archbishopric Church maintains a presence in Baghdad, as does the Armenian Evangelical Church of Baghdad. Some Armenian churches were also targets of bombing and some Armenians have died as a result of sectarian fighting in Iraq. Contributions to Iraqi culture Armenian Church in Baghdad. Armenians have played traditionally an important role in Iraqi culture, particularly in literature and music and in general all arts. Armenian folk music and dance is admired in Iraq. Yaacoub Sarkis was a famous author and researcher in Iraqi arts. He used to hold cultural gatherings in Baghdad's Murabba'a region on the Tigris river, where the Iraqi cultural elite would meet. He is also renowned for the two-volume Al Mabaheth al Iraqiyyah, a definitive guide of Iraqi history and society. He lived well into his eighties before his death in the 1950s. The two founding members of the Western-style pop group Unknown to No One, Art Haroutunian and Shant Garabedian, are of Armenian heritage. During Saddam's reign the band could only have its music aired once they sang a song celebrating the dictator's birthday. Unknown to No One has been given a large amount of publicity in the post-Saddam era.Nawa, Fariba. \\"Iraq's Boy Band Dreams Big.\\" Scholastic News. In Iraqi Kurdistan Armenian populations in Iraqi Kurdistan have been in the region since the 1920s, after they were displaced in the Armenian Genocide. Their numbers have increased considerably with waves of new immigration coming from Baghdad and other Iraqi regions after the toppling of Saddam. Armenians attribute their leaving towards the north to safety concerns, with some Armenian institutions and churches having been targeted by bombings, and some Armenians subject of kidnapping and killings in Baghdad and central regions of Iraq. The Armenians consider the Kurdish-dominated parts of Iraq in general to be much safer areas to live in. A Kurdish Government official representing the Armenian community reported to Araratnews in 2011 that Iraqi Kurdistan had 3,600-3,800 Armenians- but this number is likely much higher now due to population displacements due to ISIS and Kurdish annexations of disputed territory. The Armenians of Iraqi Kurdistan have two schools (in Erbil and Dohuk) and five churches (in Dohuk, Erbil, Avzrog, Havresk, Zakho). There is also an Armenian church and about 30 families in Kirkuk, a city in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Armenians in Iraqi Kurdistan have one reserved minority seat in the parliament of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Armenian villages =Avzrog= A notable Armenian village exists in Avzrog, a village in the Iraqi province of Dohuk. There are in fact two Avzrogs: one populated by Armenians, and the other by Assyrians. The name of the village comes from the Kurdish language: ' (water) and ' (yellow). The Armenian one is called Avzrog Miri, while the Assyrian is called Avzrog Shno. The village was built for the first time in 1932 when the Armenians of Zakho and its suburbs decided to establish the village and settle in it. The village was destroyed in 1975 by Saddam Huseein and resettled with Arabs. In 1996, the town was repopulated with Armenians and the Arab tribes who settled in the village were driven out, and later on the local St Vartans church was reconsecrated and built in 2001. Additionally, although the villagers are Armenian, they do not speak Armenian but Kurdish. Armenians in Avzrog maintain their Armenian social identity like folklore, religion and names nevertheless. Avzrog has a total population of about 350 people. =Havresk= Havresk is an Armenian village founded in 1928 by Armenians fleeing Turkey in the Armenian Genocide. It was a large and prosperous village during the 1950s, having an Artesian aquifer, library, church, and school. However, during the Al-Anfal Campaign it was destroyed and its Armenian residents forcibly evicted. It was rebuilt in 2005, however, and now has a population of 100 families. The village has 115 houses, a greenhouse, a school, and a church that was recently built in 2012. The town's mayor (mukhtar) is Murad Vardanian. The village is located roughly 5 miles southeast of Avzrog in the Plain south of Zakho.coordinates of the village- 36.897605, 42.711520 =Aghajanian= A small Armenian populated village of 20 houses was built in the Nineveh plains of Iraq between the cities of Karemlash to the south and Bakhdida in the north. The village was created in order to accommodate Armenian refugees from Baghdad and other areas in Iraq. The village is named after the financier and developer of the village, the Assyrian politician and businessman Sarkis Aghajan Mamendo.

The term is mostly used colloquially when the weight is placed on the balls of the feet rather than literally on the tips of the toes; literal tip-toeing is difficult but possible, as in the pointe technique of ballet. In running, landing on the ball of the foot is known as forefoot strike. Kinesiology To go into tiptoe, the ankle must be flexed to raise the heel off the ground. This requires the engagement of the calf muscle, along with various other muscles in the foot and shin to stabilize the joint. Even with this, the form is often less stable, requiring the engaging of muscles within the torso and a better sense of weight for the person to stay balanced. There is generally some movement, even subtle, in the ankle, as holding it statically would make balance difficult, so it is the first to give. Uses Height A baby stands on tiptoes to reach a book Raising up on the toes will increase someone's height and reach. It is used often to make someone appear taller, whether in an engagement, or when measuring one's height. It is also used to reach objects that are higher up than one can reach when on one's heels.http://www.babycenter.com/404_is-it-normal-for-my-toddler- to-walk-on-her-tiptoes_11648.bc Quietness Walking only on the balls of the foot greatly reduces the surface area of the foot on the ground, allowing what does touch the ground to be more carefully placed, which is useful for avoiding twigs, and also for a more quiet walking. The disadvantage is that it will also focus the weight, which leaves greater indentations and exerts more pressure. This will commonly happen in walking, but can be slowly controlled, so it is more a factor for when wearing shoes in the dark (or when one has one's eyes or attention averted elsewhere), when obstructions cannot be felt with bare feet, or seen. Prowling about on tiptoe is the stereotypical candor of a thief or spy, often accompanied by light tones sounding upon each of their steps. Rotation When rotating on either one leg or two, the body requires reducing friction. Raising to one leg is often one source of doing this, although since it doubles the weight on the other leg, it is not effective, so is mainly done when the other leg is used to torque to increase a spin, or very quickly so that the mass is more in the air, and has not settled on the other foot. The main method of decreasing the friction is decreasing the surface area of the foot. This is done by either going on the heel of the foot, ball of the foot, or sometimes, the toe/toes of the feet (often only possible by very light people, such as Rose in Titanic, or those with ballet shoes for En pointe known as Pointe shoe). The reduction of surface area is not actually what decreases the friction, however. Rather, the weight of the body is centred above the point of contact, so that the centre of gravity occurs on the axis of rotation. This allows a faster spin with far less force placed upon the stabilizers. Bringing in the limbs (much like on a spinning swing) also accelerates this. With two legs, the centre of gravity would still occur on the axis of rotation, and be centred directly between the two points of contact. This is utilized in dance (namely ballet, with Relev√©, Elev√©/rise, and ), martial arts, footbag, and anything else that requires dynamic twists, changes in direction, and spins. The friction of rotation is still considerable, however, and tends to wear, toughen, and polish the area of the foot being rotated upon. As a comparison, in breakdancing, those who perform headspins often go bald. The foot is more tailored to absorbing and benefitting from such rotations, although perhaps not so much on hard level surfaces, as our natural environment usually is uneven and has some give. This is why it is easier and safer to do by implementing one of two factors: *Reducing friction by doing it on a polished slippery floor, or ice, or wearing footwear which has less friction or is more able to absorb it, such as a sock, ballet shoe, or skate. *Increasing give (and possibly friction) but spreading the force to a larger area of the foot by having give, mostly in the surface (such as gym or karate mats). Rotating on the ball of the foot is normally preferred due to the normal advantage of tiptoe, and the springiness of the body, which is why many martial arts encourage sparring opponents to stay on tip toe the entire match, for better movement as well as rotation. As there are actually two surfaces to the ball of the foot, and toes to grip, it also allows better control. In theory, however, rotation on the ball of the foot is much faster. The main problem is the danger of either falling backwards or of not keeping up the pose, falling back on the balls of the foot. Twists done on the heel of the foot are often quick twists, done leaning backwards while bringing the foot upwards in an arc, so that it is more of a controlled fall that the other foot can come out and stabilize. Literal While it is possible to literally tip-toe, it does not seem biomechanically viable. While strong enough to temporarily support bodyweight, toes would not likely be able to accommodate the rotational forces (especially while keeping rigid, and balanced) involved in spinning. As the big toe is prominent, literal tip toe would involve raising up on the big toe, otherwise the legs would require outward rotation to make other toes touch, rotating out mostly at the hips and risking injury in the knees if not done properly. It is an impressive stunt, much akin to finger-tip push ups, although not as visually obvious, making it difficult to evaluate, as toes are shorter and wider, making the difference between the tips and pads of the toes (as in fingers) far more difficult to discern.

It is the only member of the genus Liberiictis. Phylogenetic analysis shows it is closely related to other small, social mongooses and that the banded mongoose is its closest relative. It was discovered in Liberia in 1958. Little was known about the animal, except what local natives related. They typically forage in packs consisting of 3-8 individuals, but larger groups have been observed. Their diet consists of earthworms and various insects. The exact distribution is unknown, but may extend from Sierra Leone to C√¥te d'Ivoire. Confirmed sightings are restricted to forests in Liberia and the Tai National Park in C√¥te d'Ivoire. Human activity such as mining, agriculture, hunting and logging has displaced the Liberian mongoose from its previous range. A live specimen was exhibited at the Toronto Zoo, but civil war in Liberia has prevented further study. Due to its limited range and the fact that it is heavily hunted, the Liberian mongoose is considered endangered. The Liberian mongoose has a primarily dark brown body, with a darker stripe on the neck and shoulders. This stripe is bordered by smaller stripes that are white. Compared with other mongoose species, the Liberian mongoose has rather long claws and an elongated snout with small teeth relative to the size of the skull. It has a bushy tapering tail, that is less than half of the length of the head and body. This is likely an adaptation of their specialized diet of earthworms. One of the few specimens ever seen alive was found in a burrow close to a termite nest. The animal's physical characteristics, and its preferred locality to insects, has led experts to suggest that the Liberian mongoose is primarily insectivorous. The few observers that have witnessed this species in the wild have reported that the animal lives primarily in the trunks of trees. Indeed, some of the better-known mongoose species live in tree during the rainy season and occupy burrows only during hotter weather. The collection of juveniles at the end of July and a lactating female at the beginning of August suggests that breeding coincides with the rainy season, when there is an increase in food availability. This species is extremely rare, and has been listed by the IUCN as endangered. Human destruction of their habitat and human hunting are the primary threats to Liberian mongooses. Owing to their rarity, they were not described until 1958, with the first complete specimens discovered as recently as 1974. An attempt to study them in 1988 yielded only one animal, which had already been killed by a hunter. The specimen that lived at the Toronto Zoo has since died. This rarity also limited what is understood about the Liberian mongoose's interaction with other aspects of the ecosystem. Recent work has shown that they may act as an ecosystem engineer by maintaining the heterogeneity of the forest floor. Through field observations and radio- tracking, a group of mongooses was followed for a period of three months, with a record of their foraging traces being kept. As they forage, they disturb the leaf litter and soil, with an estimate that they may be able to overturn the entire forest floor in a period of 8 months. This altering of the litter environment indirectly affects seed predation and germination. The Liberian mongoose is also host to a species of Mallophaga (chewing louse) known as Felicola liberiae. Political unrest in the areas in which they live has made further studies difficult in recent years.

It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2008.  Taxonomy  Herpestes gambianus was the scientific name proposed by William Ogilby in 1835 for a mongoose specimen from Gambia. Characteristics The Gambian mongoose has a grizzled grey and brown fur, which is mixed with red on the back, hips and thighs. Its throat and the sides of the neck are pale silvery brown, and the neck is marked with a dark brown stripe running from the ear to the shoulder. The breast, belly and inner sides of the legs are red. Its feet are black, and its tail is mixed with black and has a black tuft at the end. It has five toes on each foot, which is bare from the sole to the wrist and heel. Their faces are short, and have only two molars on each jaw. Females have six mammae. Distribution and habitat The Gambian mongoose is endemic to West Africa where it can be found in the mesic savannas and woodlands from Senegal and Gambia in the west east to Nigeria. Behaviour and ecology The Gambian mongoose is diurnal, gregarious and terrestrial. They live in groups of 10-20 individuals, but groups have been known to number over 40. The groups consist of adults of both sexes, who forage together. Encounters between animals of different groups are often noisy, with a lot of fighting between the neighbors. This mongoose is very vocal, communicating with a variety of sounds. A call that sounds like a bird twitter is used to keep the group together while foraging. A louder, higher pitched twitter is used to indicate danger. The Gambian mongoose is an opportunistic feeder, eating a wide variety of foods. They are primarily insectivorous, eating mostly beetles and millipedes. They will also eat small rodents and reptiles, and sometimes eggs. Reproduction Breeding occurs at any time of the year, with more young born during the rainy season. All the females in the group reproduce at around the same time. Groups can breed up to four times a year, but individually the females do not breed as frequently. Mating occurs 1‚Äì2 weeks after the young are born. Mongooses often breed with others of another group, but most stay within the group. While the mother forages for food, two males stand guard at the den's entrance. This mongoose practices communal suckling; cubs suckle from any lactating female. The young are weaned at the age of about one month, and at this time they join the group in foraging.

Particularly, it refers to the archaeological site in which the remains of this ancient settlement lie, at a place known as El Tossal de Manises, in the neighborhood of Albufereta. Ancient History Funerary vase from the necropolis of Lucentum. Diodorus ascribes Lucentum's foundation to the Carthaginian leader Hamilcar Barcas. As a Mediterranean and Iberian commercial center, it had trading contacts with Greece, Phoenicia, and the southern Iberian city of Tartessos, absorbing some of their influences. This unique mixture gave rise to a culture called Contestani by Pliny the Elder and Strabo. Its ruins include various distinctly Carthaginian features. The Punic town was known to the Greeks as the \\"White Cliff\\" or \\"White Fort\\", variously given as (), (), and ().\\"Roman Policy in Spain\\", Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, p.209. Livy translated the second sense of the Greek name into Latin, calling the settlement . The Greek probably translated the site's Punic name, although some prefer to imagine it transcribes an Iberian placename involving the words lug (\\"water\\") and cant (\\"cliff\\").See Jacques R. Pauwels, Beneath the Dust of Time: A History of the Names of Peoples and Places, London, 2009. The city enjoyed its peak between the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD, and the majority of the city's remains bear a Roman stamp. The town was refounded as Lucentum (from Latin ', \\"Place of Light\\" or \\"Bright Place\\") after P. Cornelius Scipio conquered the area in the course of the Second Punic War. Over the years it gained a thoroughly Roman character, complete with baths, forums, temples, sewers, etc. It was one of the major cities of the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis. It entered into a decline in the 2nd century and was effectively abandoned by the end of the 3rd century. The chief cause of this decline was competition from the neighboring city of Ilici (today's Elche), which had better water and land communications and began to usurp Lucentum's trade. Eventually, the settlement was completely depopulated, the site used only for a Muslim cemetery during the 10th and 11th centuries. Modern history The first modern evidence concerning the location of the ancient city came in 1780, when the Count of Lumiares, Antonio Valc√°rcel P√≠o de Saboya, suggested that the ruins of Tossal de Manises - which he personally had excavated for a number of years ‚Äî were in fact Lucentum. This contradicted the common wisdom at the time, which held that the Roman city was well outside the town of Alicante. Later, the ruins were excavated by Lafuente and Figueras, who found the more ancient Carthaginian city. In the 1930s they were again excavated by a Professor Belda, around which time a necropolis was discovered during road construction. Hypothetical reconstruction of the city plan circa 1st century AD The site contains evidence of both the Iberian and the Roman epochs, although in terms of material recovered and ruins remaining the Roman influences (especially from the 1st century AD and afterwards) predominate. The Roman city was constructed over the Iberian one, of which practically nothing remains except for the walls. The lower level is contemporary with a necropolis excavated in the 1930s to make way for a road, and whose materials are now housed in the Archaeological Museum of Alicante. Among these, a number of cauldrons stand out as well as Iberian ceramics decorated with geometric shapes, birds, and fish, sculptures, jewelry, amulets of Egyptian origin, terracotta ware, and weapons. Of the jewelry recovered, a type of pendant, possibly for masculine use, is quite notable as it suggests that there was a local workshop whose production made its way into other local burial sites. Finally, the \\"Kore de Alicante\\", currently housed in the Archaeological Museum of Catalonia could have come from this site. In the post-war period, the site (located in a privileged place, with an excellent view of the ancient lagoon and bay) was in danger of disappearing, a victim of real estate speculation. However, efforts by those in favor of its preservation, most notably the Swedish archaeologist Solveig Nordstr√∂m, succeeded in defending the site. This effort culminated in the 1961 designation as an \\"Artistic and Historic Monument\\", which afforded some legal protection. Unfortunately, the preservation movement could not stop much development around the site, with the result that the ruins are surrounded by tall buildings and is in no way \\"visually pure\\". Despite the legal protections which had been won for the ruins, they suffered from neglect and exposure for a number of years, until efforts were finally made in the 1990s to conserve them. This resulted in recent construction, directed by the architect Rafael P√©rez Jim√©nez and the archaeologist Manuel Olcina Dom√©nech, which aims at the definitive and irreversible conservation of what remains of the ruins. Such a recuperation represents a cultural milestone for Alicante. Lucentum Today forum of Lucentum Currently, one can visit the archaeological site, which covers an area of some . The most noticeable features are the remains of the fortifying wall (including the foundations of the pre-Roman defensive towers), the baths, the forum, part of the Muslim necropolis, and a multitude of houses. In addition, a part of the Tossal de Manisses is currently being excavated, which it is hoped will increase the size and importance of the site. The influence of Lucentum is also present in the culture of the area, with many businesses, associations, and sports clubs in the Alicante area bearing the name of the ancient city.

It was manufactured and co-marketed by Columbia Records and was distributed by Sony Music Entertainment. The label specializes in compilation albums of the WWE wrestlers' entrance themes, often by contributing performing artists, but also releases titles that have been actually performed by the wrestlers themselves, including the various-artists album WWE Originals and John Cena's You Can't See Me. Historically, most WWE entrance themes have been created by Jim Johnston since the 1980s, while in recent times, themes have been written or performed by John Alicastro and Mike Lauri, known collectively as CFO$ from 2014 to 2020. History Beginnings The series of World Wrestling Federation (WWF) produced albums began in 1985 with The Wrestling Album. The album contained the song \\"Land of a Thousand Dances\\", recorded by a majority of the WWF roster at the time (including Roddy Piper, Jesse Ventura, and Randy Savage). The locker room would later reconvene for the song's music video. Later in 1993, WrestleMania: The Album was released, but it failed to chart on the Billboard 200. By 2002, however, it had sold a total of 91,000 copies. Format change and success The format of the wrestling albums changed in 1996, as the focus went from the wrestlers themselves singing to a compilation of various wrestlers' entrance themes. WWF Full Metal was the first album released with the new focus, and included the Monday Night Raw theme \\"Thorn in Your Eye\\" by Slam Jam, a supergroup composed of members of metal bands Anthrax, Savatage, Pro-Pain, and Overkill. In October, the album reached No. 184 on the Billboard 200 and by 2002, had sold 173,000 copies. This new format proved to be a success. The follow-up album, WWE The Music, Vol. 2, which was released two years later, spent sixteen weeks on the chart and sold over 480,000 copies. WWE The Music, Vol. 3 and WWE The Music, Vol. 4, released in December 1998 and October 1999 respectively, each sold over one million copies. In particular, Vol. 3 reached No. 10 on the Billboard 200, spent thirty weeks on the chart, and sold over 1.21 million copies. The album reached position No. 4 in its d√©but week, stayed on the charts for twenty weeks, and sold over 1.13 million copies. On 21 March 2000, the company worked with Priority Records to release a hip-hop album titled WWF Aggression, which involved rappers such as Snoop Dogg, ODB, Method Man, and Kool Keith, all of whom recorded versions of various wrestlers' entrance themes. This album differed from previous albums, which were more along the lines of rock music. Despite the change, the album still sold approximately 640,000 copies. In October 2000, WWE announced the launch of the record label under the name SmackDown! Records, with Ron McCarrell as the president. In February 2001, WWE The Music, Vol. 5 d√©buted on the Billboard 200 at position No. 2, spending two weeks in the top twenty and selling 176,000 copies. as well as reaching No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart and No. 5 in the Canadian Albums Chart. The album included an original song by The Rock. By 2002, Vol. 5 had sold 640,000 copies. In September 2001, the WWE Tough Enough album sold 138,000 copies. In May 2001, WWE signed their first act, the heavy metal band Neurotica, and released their third album in June 2002, the only non-wrestling related album released on the label so far, before they disbanded. In 2002, WWE Forceable Entry sold 145,000 copies in its first week to enter the Billboard 200 at position No. 3. It was the fourth consecutive WWE album to d√©but in the top ten of the Billboard 200. Forceable Entry also d√©buted on the Billboard Hard Rock Albums Chart. The album included music from Creed, Our Lady Peace, Limp Bizkit, Marilyn Manson, Kid Rock, Drowning Pool, Rob Zombie, Sevendust, and Saliva. Later in the year, WWE Anthology was certified platinum after just 10 days of release. As of March 2006, WWE officially announced the launching of the \\"WWE Music Group\\" under the management of Neil Lawi, who not only maintains the label but selects songs to be used on television and pay-per-view events, and regularly scouts new talent to showcase via WWE. Within two months of operation, the newly restructured label had an album reach the top 10 of the Billboard 200 when WWE Wreckless Intent, with songs by artists such as Mot√∂rhead, Three 6 Mafia, P.O.D., and Killswitch Engage, reached No. 8. In 2007, the label released ¬°Quiero Vivir!, the d√©but album of WWE ring announcer Lilian Garcia, in conjunction with Universal Music Latino. In 2007, WWE released WWE The Music, Vol. 7, the company's first digital-only album, on iTunes, and starting in 2012, WWE began making old albums available through online stores, starting with the first five \\"Volume\\" albums released from 1995 to 2001. On 20 April 2013, the entrance theme of wrestler Fandango reached No. 44 in the UK Singles Chart, after briefly being close to the Top 10 in the mid-week charts. Following the NXT Arrival show on 27 February 2014, WWE released singles of eight NXT wrestlers created by CFO$, and it was followed in May by the music video and single of Tyler Breeze. On November 30, 2017 it was reported that Jim Johnston's contract with the WWE had expired and that the company had released him after more than thirty-two years of employment.https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/wrestling/legendary- wwe-entrance-music-composer-11617585http://whatculture.com/wwe/wwe-release- jim-johnston Disputed issues Composer James D. Papa filed a lawsuit against the WWE Music Group, Michael Hayes, and Jim Johnston in July 2012 over the use of the music from World Championship Wrestling, citing redirected royalty payments to several wrestling related songs he either wrote or co- wrote by securing the rights to music unlawfully. Along with the defendants of the case were long with VE Newco LLC, the parent company of Vivendi Entertainment (distribution of WWE DVD and Blu-rays), Yukes (WWE video games), and Take-Two Interactive (who owns the WWE video game license after THQ filed for bankruptcy in January 2013) were added in September 2013.http://www.yardbarker.com/wwe/articles/songwriter_files_lawsuit_against_wwe_over_unauthorized_use_of_wcw_theme_music/11249998 The filing noted that the two sides resolved their issues following an alternative dispute resolution conference because there are a number of WWE Network versions of World Championship Wrestling PPVs using all 11 songs from the Slam Jam CD that were placed on the Network, replacing versions of the PPV that had edited out the original music. A similar lawsuit brought against the company by Harry \\"Slash\\" Grivas and Roderick Kohn over the rights to original music used by Extreme Championship Wrestling that WWE had been using during the Invasion storyline of 2001 was resolved with a settlement that saw WWE purchase the catalogue outright in January 2005 along with the assets in 2003 in bankruptcy court. The case was then settled in court on May 5, 2014 before the March 23, 2015 trial date. However, WWE has again denied any wrongdoing and claimed that since Papa \\"consented to use\\" of his music in WCW and World Class Championship Wrestling broadcasts, and subsequently, WWE would have the rights to his material since they acquired the copyrights lawfully. WWE also said that the music in the World Class documentary would be \\"fair use\\" and that Papa did not have any copyright for the \\"clone song\\" that Johnston created, so any claim against that song should be thrown out.http://angrymarks.com/?ArticleID=29411 In other media *In September 2017, a commercial for Toyota Camry used John Cena's entrance theme \\"The Time is Now\\".https://uproxx.com/prowrestling/john-cena-toyota-commercial/ *In NHL 17, Adam Rose's entrance theme song, \\"Break Away\\" by CFO$ is used as the goal song for the Ottawa Senators.

The bridges were the focus of a $1.15 million WisDOT project. Later in 2003, a lumber truck crashed into another vehicle at the intersection of WIS 186 and WIS 13; the truck's logs spilled onto the highway, and both roads were closed for several hours to clean up the lumber.

It was occasionally used in early times to signify the Holy Eucharist, and in this sense is especially frequent in the writings of St. Cyril of Alexandria. The origin of this use is doubtless to be found in the words of St. Paul (1 Corinthians 10:16); to poterion tes eulogias ho eulogoumen. But the more general use is for such objects as bread, wine etc., which it was customary to distribute after the celebration of the Divine Mysteries. Bread so blessed, we learn from St. Augustine (De pecat. merit., ii, 26), was customarily distributed in his time to catechumens, and he even gives it the name of sacramentum, as having received the formal blessing of the Church: \\"Quod acceperunt catechumeni, quamvis non sit corpus Christi, sanctum tamen est, et sanctius quam cibi quibus alimur, quoniam sacramentum est\\" (What the catechumens receive, though it is not the Body of Christ, is holy ‚Äî holier, indeed, than our ordinary food, since it is a sacramentum). For the extension of this custom in later ages, see Antidoron; Sacramental bread. The word eulogia has a special use in connection with monastic life. In the Benedictine Rule monks are forbidden to receive \\"litteras, eulogias, vel quaelibet munuscula\\" without the abbot's leave. Here the word may be used in the sense of blessed bread only, but it seems to have a wider signification, and to designate any kind of present. There was a custom in monasteries of distributing in the refectories, after Mass, the eulogiae of bread blessed at the Mass.

It occurs in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It is the only member of the genus Rhynchogale.  Description  Meller's mongoose is a medium to large-size mongoose with a light to dark brown body and a long tail. At close quarters the upper parts of Meller's mongoose are coarsely grizzled. The lower parts of the limbs are darker than the upper parts of the body. The under parts are generally lighter in colour than the upper parts. It measures about 80 cm in length overall and weighs 2‚Äì3 kg. The tail is slightly less than half the overall length. The tail is variable in colour and may be black, brown or white, although dark brown to black is the most usual. Meller's mongoose may be confused with the white-tailed mongoose, however it is smaller and blacker overall than this species.  Distribution and habitat  Meller's Mongoose ranges from central Tanzania south through Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, to Swaziland and northeastern South Africa. It has been recorded to 1,850m asl in Tanzania. Meller's mongoose is a savanna species, mainly associated with open woodland and grassland and marshy areas with termitaria. It lives in miombo (Brachystegia) woodlands in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi and montane bamboo forests in Tanzania. It appears to require dense cover throughout the year and is rarely seen in areas where fires are extensive and frequent.  Behaviour and ecology  Meller's mongoose is nocturnal, solitary and terrestrial. They do not appear until well after sunset and continue to be active until about midnight.  Diet  Meller's mongoose feeds mainly on termites, particularly harvester termites (Hodotermes) and the larger Macrotermes. They also eat grasshoppers, small reptiles, centipedes, beetles and frogs.  Reproduction They appear to breed at the beginning of the wet season (November to December). 2-3 young are born in burrows or rock crevices. Females have two pairs of abdominal mammae.  Threats  There are no major known threats to the species. Its favoured habitat is extensive, and in some parts overlaps with very low human populations. However, human expansion and domestic dogs could represent a significant threat in localised areas. However, in parts of northern South Africa the species has been recorded in areas with high human and domestic dog disturbances.  Status and abundance  Listed as Least Concern by IUCN, it is apparently uncommon to rare, but it may be easily overlooked or confused with other mongoose species.

The \\"feedstock\\" (coating precursor) is heated by electrical (plasma or arc) or chemical means (combustion flame). Thermal spraying can provide thick coatings (approx. thickness range is 20 microns to several mm, depending on the process and feedstock), over a large area at high deposition rate as compared to other coating processes such as electroplating, physical and chemical vapor deposition. Coating materials available for thermal spraying include metals, alloys, ceramics, plastics and composites. They are fed in powder or wire form, heated to a molten or semimolten state and accelerated towards substrates in the form of micrometer-size particles. Combustion or electrical arc discharge is usually used as the source of energy for thermal spraying. Resulting coatings are made by the accumulation of numerous sprayed particles. The surface may not heat up significantly, allowing the coating of flammable substances. Coating quality is usually assessed by measuring its porosity, oxide content, macro and micro-hardness, bond strength and surface roughness. Generally, the coating quality increases with increasing particle velocities. Variations Several variations of thermal spraying are distinguished: *Plasma spraying *Detonation spraying *Wire arc spraying *Flame spraying *High velocity oxy-fuel coating spraying (HVOF) *High velocity air fuel (HVAF) *Warm spraying *Cold spraying *Spray and Fuse In classical (developed between 1910 and 1920) but still widely used processes such as flame spraying and wire arc spraying, the particle velocities are generally low (< 150 m/s), and raw materials must be molten to be deposited. Plasma spraying, developed in the 1970s, uses a high-temperature plasma jet generated by arc discharge with typical temperatures >15,000 K, which makes it possible to spray refractory materials such as oxides, molybdenum, etc. System overview A typical thermal spray system consists of the following: *Spray torch (or spray gun) ‚Äì the core device performing the melting and acceleration of the particles to be deposited *Feeder ‚Äì for supplying the powder, wire or liquid to the torch through tubes. *Media supply ‚Äì gases or liquids for the generation of the flame or plasma jet, gases for carrying the powder, etc. *Robot ‚Äì for manipulating the torch or the substrates to be coated *Power supply ‚Äì often standalone for the torch *Control console(s) ‚Äì either integrated or individual for all of the above Detonation thermal spraying process The detonation gun consists of a long water-cooled barrel with inlet valves for gases and powder. Oxygen and fuel (acetylene most common) are fed into the barrel along with a charge of powder. A spark is used to ignite the gas mixture, and the resulting detonation heats and accelerates the powder to supersonic velocity through the barrel. A pulse of nitrogen is used to purge the barrel after each detonation. This process is repeated many times a second. The high kinetic energy of the hot powder particles on impact with the substrate results in a buildup of a very dense and strong coating. Plasma spraying Wire flame spraying In plasma spraying process, the material to be deposited (feedstock) ‚Äî typically as a powder, sometimes as a liquid, suspension or wire ‚Äî is introduced into the plasma jet, emanating from a plasma torch. In the jet, where the temperature is on the order of 10,000 K, the material is melted and propelled towards a substrate. There, the molten droplets flatten, rapidly solidify and form a deposit. Commonly, the deposits remain adherent to the substrate as coatings; free-standing parts can also be produced by removing the substrate. There are a large number of technological parameters that influence the interaction of the particles with the plasma jet and the substrate and therefore the deposit properties. These parameters include feedstock type, plasma gas composition and flow rate, energy input, torch offset distance, substrate cooling, etc.  Deposit properties  The deposits consist of a multitude of pancake-like 'splats' called lamellae, formed by flattening of the liquid droplets. As the feedstock powders typically have sizes from micrometers to above 100 micrometers, the lamellae have thickness in the micrometer range and lateral dimension from several to hundreds of micrometers. Between these lamellae, there are small voids, such as pores, cracks and regions of incomplete bonding. As a result of this unique structure, the deposits can have properties significantly different from bulk materials. These are generally mechanical properties, such as lower strength and modulus, higher strain tolerance, and lower thermal and electrical conductivity. Also, due to the rapid solidification, metastable phases can be present in the deposits.  Applications  This technique is mostly used to produce coatings on structural materials. Such coatings provide protection against high temperatures (for example thermal barrier coatings for exhaust heat management), corrosion, erosion, wear; they can also change the appearance, electrical or tribological properties of the surface, replace worn material, etc. When sprayed on substrates of various shapes and removed, free- standing parts in the form of plates, tubes, shells, etc. can be produced. It can also be used for powder processing (spheroidization, homogenization, modification of chemistry, etc.). In this case, the substrate for deposition is absent and the particles solidify during flight or in a controlled environment (e.g., water). This technique with variation may also be used to create porous structures, suitable for bone ingrowth, as a coating for medical implants. A polymer dispersion aerosol can be injected into the plasma discharge in order to create a grafting of this polymer on to a substrate surface. This application is mainly used to modify the surface chemistry of polymers. Variations Plasma spraying systems can be categorized by several criteria. Plasma jet generation: *direct current (DC plasma), where the energy is transferred to the plasma jet by a direct current, high-power electric arc *induction plasma or RF plasma, where the energy is transferred by induction from a coil around the plasma jet, through which an alternating, radio-frequency current passes Plasma-forming medium: *gas-stabilized plasma (GSP), where the plasma forms from a gas; typically argon, hydrogen, helium or their mixtures *water-stabilized plasma (WSP), where plasma forms from water (through evaporation, dissociation and ionization) or other suitable liquid *hybrid plasma ‚Äì with combined gas and liquid stabilization, typically argon and water Spraying environment: *atmospheric plasma spraying (APS), performed in ambient air *controlled atmosphere plasma spraying (CAPS), usually performed in a closed chamber, either filled with inert gas or evacuated *variations of CAPS: high-pressure plasma spraying (HPPS), low-pressure plasma spraying (LPPS), the extreme case of which is vacuum plasma spraying (VPS, see below) *underwater plasma spraying Another variation consists of having a liquid feedstock instead of a solid powder for melting, this technique is known as Solution precursor plasma spray Vacuum plasma spraying Vacuum plasma spraying Vacuum plasma spraying (VPS) is a technology for etching and surface modification to create porous layers with high reproducibility and for cleaning and surface engineering of plastics, rubbers and natural fibers as well as for replacing CFCs for cleaning metal components. This surface engineering can improve properties such as frictional behavior, heat resistance, surface electrical conductivity, lubricity, cohesive strength of films, or dielectric constant, or it can make materials hydrophilic or hydrophobic. The process typically operates at 39‚Äì120 ¬∞C to avoid thermal damage. It can induce non-thermally activated surface reactions, causing surface changes which cannot occur with molecular chemistries at atmospheric pressure. Plasma processing is done in a controlled environment inside a sealed chamber at a medium vacuum, around 13‚Äì65 Pa. The gas or mixture of gases is energized by an electrical field from DC to microwave frequencies, typically 1‚Äì500 W at 50 V. The treated components are usually electrically isolated. The volatile plasma by-products are evacuated from the chamber by the vacuum pump, and if necessary can be neutralized in an exhaust scrubber. In contrast to molecular chemistry, plasmas employ: * Molecular, atomic, metastable and free radical species for chemical effects. * Positive ions and electrons for kinetic effects. Plasma also generates electromagnetic radiation in the form of vacuum UV photons to penetrate bulk polymers to a depth of about 10 Œºm. This can cause chain scissions and cross-linking. Plasmas affect materials at an atomic level. Techniques like X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy are used for surface analysis to identify the processes required and to judge their effects. As a simple indication of surface energy, and hence adhesion or wettability, often a water droplet contact angle test is used. The lower the contact angle, the higher the surface energy and more hydrophilic the material is. Changing effects with plasma At higher energies ionization tends to occur more than chemical dissociations. In a typical reactive gas, 1 in 100 molecules form free radicals whereas only 1 in 106 ionizes. The predominant effect here is the forming of free radicals. Ionic effects can predominate with selection of process parameters and if necessary the use of noble gases.  Wire arc spray  Wire arc spray is a form of thermal spraying where two consumable metal wires are fed independently into the spray gun. These wires are then charged and an arc is generated between them. The heat from this arc melts the incoming wire, which is then entrained in an air jet from the gun. This entrained molten feedstock is then deposited onto a substrate with the help of compressed air. This process is commonly used for metallic, heavy coatings. Plasma transferred wire arc Plasma transferred wire arc (PTWA) is another form of wire arc spray which deposits a coating on the internal surface of a cylinder, or on the external surface of a part of any geometry. It is predominantly known for its use in coating the cylinder bores of an engine, enabling the use of Aluminum engine blocks without the need for heavy cast iron sleeves. A single conductive wire is used as \\"feedstock\\" for the system. A supersonic plasma jet melts the wire, atomizes it and propels it onto the substrate. The plasma jet is formed by a transferred arc between a non-consumable cathode and the type of a wire. After atomization, forced air transports the stream of molten droplets onto the bore wall. The particles flatten when they impinge on the surface of the substrate, due to the high kinetic energy. The particles rapidly solidify upon contact. The stacked particles make up a high wear resistant coating. The PTWA thermal spray process utilizes a single wire as the feedstock material. All conductive wires up to and including 0.0625\\" (1.6mm) can be used as feedstock material, including \\"cored\\" wires. PTWA can be used to apply a coating to the wear surface of engine or transmission components to replace a bushing or bearing. For example, using PTWA to coat the bearing surface of a connecting rod offers a number of benefits including reductions in weight, cost, friction potential, and stress in the connecting rod. High velocity oxygen fuel spraying (HVOF) HVOF schematic During the 1980s, a class of thermal spray processes called high velocity oxy-fuel spraying was developed. A mixture of gaseous or liquid fuel and oxygen is fed into a combustion chamber, where they are ignited and combusted continuously. The resultant hot gas at a pressure close to 1 MPa emanates through a converging‚Äìdiverging nozzle and travels through a straight section. The fuels can be gases (hydrogen, methane, propane, propylene, acetylene, natural gas, etc.) or liquids (kerosene, etc.). The jet velocity at the exit of the barrel (>1000 m/s) exceeds the speed of sound. A powder feed stock is injected into the gas stream, which accelerates the powder up to 800 m/s. The stream of hot gas and powder is directed towards the surface to be coated. The powder partially melts in the stream, and deposits upon the substrate. The resulting coating has low porosity and high bond strength. HVOF coatings may be as thick as 12 mm (1/2\\"). It is typically used to deposit wear and corrosion resistant coatings on materials, such as ceramic and metallic layers. Common powders include WC-Co, chromium carbide, MCrAlY, and alumina. The process has been most successful for depositing cermet materials (WC‚ÄìCo, etc.) and other corrosion-resistant alloys (stainless steels, nickel-based alloys, aluminium, hydroxyapatite for medical implants, etc.).  High Velocity Air Fuel (HVAF)  HTS Coatings applying a tungsten carbide HVAF Coating to a grinding mandrel to repair the surface and increase wear resistance. HVAF coating technology is the combustion of propane in a compressed air stream. Like HVOF, this produces a uniform high velocity jet. HVAF differs by including a heat baffle to further stabilize the thermal spray mechanisms. Material is injected into the air-fuel stream and coating particles are propelled toward the part. HVAF has a maximum flame temperature of 3,560¬∞ to 3,650¬∞ F and an average particle velocity of 3,300 ft/sec. Since the maximum flame temperature is relatively close to the melting point of most spray materials, HVAF results in a more uniform, ductile coating. This also allows for a typical coating thickness of 0.002-0.050\\". HVAF coatings also have a mechanical bond strength of greater that 12,000 psi. Common HVAF coating materials include, but are not limited to; tungsten carbide, chrome carbide, stainless steel, hastelloy, and inconel. Due to its ductile nature hvaf coatings can help resist cavitation damage.  Spray and Fuse  Spray and fuse uses high heat to increase the bond between the thermal spray coating and the substrate of the part. Unlike other types of thermal spray, spray and fuse creates a metallurgical bond between the coating and the surface. This means that instead of relying on friction for coating adhesion, it melds the surface and coating material into one material. Spray and fuse comes down to the difference between adhesion and cohesion. This process usually involves spraying a powdered material onto the component then following with an acetylene torch. The torch melts the coating material and the top layer of the component material; fusing them together. Due to the high heat of spray and fuse, some heat distortion may occur, and care must be taken to determine if a component is a good candidate. These high temperatures are akin to those used in welding. This metallurgical bond creates an extremely wear and abrasion resistant coating. Spray and fuse delivers the benefits of hardface welding with the ease of thermal spray. Cold spraying Cold spraying schematic Cold spraying (or gas dynamic cold spraying) was introduced to the market in the 1990s. The method was originally developed in the Soviet Union ‚Äì while experimenting with the erosion of the target, which was exposed to a two-phase high-velocity flow of fine powder in a wind tunnel, scientists observed accidental rapid formation of coatings. In cold spraying, particles are accelerated to very high speeds by the carrier gas forced through a converging‚Äìdiverging de Laval type nozzle. Upon impact, solid particles with sufficient kinetic energy deform plastically and bond mechanically to the substrate to form a coating. The critical velocity needed to form bonding depends on the material's properties, powder size and temperature. Metals, polymers, ceramics, composite materials and nanocrystalline powders can be deposited using cold spraying. Soft metals such as Cu and Al are best suited for cold spraying, but coating of other materials (W, Ta, Ti, MCrAlY, WC‚ÄìCo, etc.) by cold spraying has been reported. The deposition efficiency is typically low for alloy powders, and the window of process parameters and suitable powder sizes is narrow. To accelerate powders to higher velocity, finer powders (<20 micrometers) are used. It is possible to accelerate powder particles to much higher velocity using a processing gas having high speed of sound (helium instead of nitrogen). However, helium is costly and its flow rate, and thus consumption, is higher. To improve acceleration capability, nitrogen gas is heated up to about 900 ¬∞C. As a result, deposition efficiency and tensile strength of deposits increase. Warm spraying Warm spraying is a novel modification of high velocity oxy-fuel spraying, in which the temperature of combustion gas is lowered by mixing nitrogen with the combustion gas, thus bringing the process closer to the cold spraying. The resulting gas contains much water vapor, unreacted hydrocarbons and oxygen, and thus is dirtier than the cold spraying. However, the coating efficiency is higher. On the other hand, lower temperatures of warm spraying reduce melting and chemical reactions of the feed powder, as compared to HVOF. These advantages are especially important for such coating materials as Ti, plastics, and metallic glasses, which rapidly oxidize or deteriorate at high temperatures.

Thermal spray application is not compatible with the substrate if the area to which it is applied is complex or blocked by other bodies. Safety Thermal spraying need not be a dangerous process if the equipment is treated with care and correct spraying practices are followed. As with any industrial process, there are a number of hazards of which the operator should be aware and against which specific precautions should be taken. Ideally, equipment should be operated automatically in enclosures specially designed to extract fumes, reduce noise levels, and prevent direct viewing of the spraying head. Such techniques will also produce coatings that are more consistent. There are occasions when the type of components being treated, or their low production levels, require manual equipment operation. Under these conditions, a number of hazards peculiar to thermal spraying are experienced in addition to those commonly encountered in production or processing industries. Noise Metal spraying equipment uses compressed gases which create noise. Sound levels vary with the type of spraying equipment, the material being sprayed, and the operating parameters. Typical sound pressure levels are measured at 1 meter behind the arc. UV light Combustion spraying equipment produces an intense flame, which may have a peak temperature more than 3,100 ¬∞C and is very bright. Electric arc spraying produces ultra-violet light which may damage delicate body tissues. Plasma also generates quite a lot of UV radiation, easily burning exposed skin and can also cause \\"flash burn\\" to the eyes. Spray booths and enclosures should be fitted with ultra-violet absorbent dark glass. Where this is not possible, operators, and others in the vicinity should wear protective goggles containing BS grade 6 green glass. Opaque screens should be placed around spraying areas. The nozzle of an arc pistol should never be viewed directly unless it is certain that no power is available to the equipment. Dust and fumes The atomization of molten materials produces a large amount of dust and fumes made up of very fine particles (ca. 80‚Äì95% of the particles by number <100 nm). Proper extraction facilities are vital not only for personal safety, but to minimize entrapment of re-frozen particles in the sprayed coatings. The use of respirators fitted with suitable filters is strongly recommended where equipment cannot be isolated. Certain materials offer specific known hazards: #Finely divided metal particles are potentially pyrophoric and harmful when accumulated in the body. #Certain materials e.g. aluminum, zinc and other base metals may react with water to evolve hydrogen. This is potentially explosive and special precautions are necessary in fume extraction equipment. #Fumes of certain materials, notably zinc and copper alloys, have a disagreeable odour and may cause a fever-type reaction in certain individuals (known as metal fume fever). This may occur some time after spraying and usually subsides rapidly. If it does not, medical advice must be sought. #Fumes of reactive compounds can dissociate and create harmful gasses. Respirators should be worn in these areas and gas meters should be used to monitor the air before respirators are removed. Heat Combustion spraying guns use oxygen and fuel gases. The fuel gases are potentially explosive. In particular, acetylene may only be used under approved conditions. Oxygen, while not explosive, will sustain combustion and many materials will spontaneously ignite if excessive oxygen levels are present. Care must be taken to avoid leakage and to isolate oxygen and fuel gas supplies when not in use. Shock hazards Electric arc guns operate at low voltages (below 45 V dc), but at relatively high currents. They may be safely hand-held. The power supply units are connected to 440 V AC sources, and must be treated with caution.

He composed two books of sacred music in a 19th-century classical style published between 1817 and 1822, Sacred Music and A 2d Collection of Sacred Music. Both books were published in York by Samuel Knapton (the father of the organist and composer Philip Knapton). They comprise 17 settings of metrical psalm and hymn texts (8 in the first book and 9 in the second), with orchestral and keyboard accompaniments, and are dedicated to Richard Lumley-Saunderson, 6th Earl of Scarbrough. There are copies of both books in the Sheffield Local Studies Library. Foster is now best known as the composer of a tune known as Old Foster, to which the words While shepherds watched their flocks by night are sung in the South Yorkshire pub carolling tradition (for example, at the Fountain Inn at Ingbirchworth). A version of the tune is also sung at Castleton, Derbyshire, where it is known as Prince of Orange and used with the words Hark, the glad sound! the Saviour comes, by Philip Doddridge. The tune was originally published in A 2d Collection of Sacred Music as a setting of Psalm 47 in the metrical version by John Hopkins, Ye people all with one accord: the pub carol tradition is thought to originate from the ejection of 'west gallery' choirs and bands from parish churches in the mid-nineteenth century. Foster is credited by Alfred Gatty, vicar of Ecclesfield from 1839 to 1903, with the suppression of dog- and cock-fighting in the local area. Commercial recordings of two of Foster's works, with full orchestral accompaniments, have been made by the group 'Psalmody' conducted by Peter Holman. Their first CD While shepherds watched includes While shepherds watched their flocks by night sung to the 'Old Foster' or Ps. 47 tune, while their CD Haydn and his English Friends includes The God of Gods, the Lord, also taken from A 2d Collection of Sacred Music.

It is the first Latin encyclopedia whose items are alphabetically ordered. It has alternatively been referred to as an encyclopedia, a glossary, and a dictionary. The earliest copies of the Liber glossarum were written in the ab-type script of Corbie and in Carolingian minuscule and for this reason it has been said that the work was most likely created at the monastery of Corbie or at a nearby nunnery during the time of the abbot Adalhard (780-814; 821-826).Bischoff, Bernard. Latin Paleography. Translated by Daibhi o Croinin and David Ganz. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Pg. 106 Adalhard was the cousin of Charlemagne, and given the immense nature of the project, it is likely that the creation of the Liber glossarum enjoyed support from Carolingian rulers, including Charlemagne himself. The Liber glossarum is the main source of Papias, it was used by Italian humanists in Florence, and later it was referenced until the seventeenth century.  History  It has been said that the Liber glossarum was part of a larger effort by the Carolingian emperors and especially Charlemagne to reform the areas of religion, royal administration, monastic organizations, and language. These reforms were aimed heavily at creating objective standards throughout the Frankish kingdoms. The \\"Carolingian Renaissance\\" refers specifically to \\"the burgeoning of intellectual and cultural life\\" during the eighth and ninth centuries in what is now modern France.McKitterick, Rosamond. The Frankish Kingdoms Under the Carolingians, 751-987. London: Longman, 1983. Pp. 140-168. Approximately 7000 Latin manuscripts survive from the ninth century while only 2000 survive from the period covering the fifth to the eighth centuries. The production and preservation of so many manuscripts is indicative of the cultural and intellectual blossoming of the period. This renaissance drew on centers of culture and lines of development which were established in Western Europe during previous centuries. The Carolingian dynasty supported a flowering of intellectual life with royal resources. They directed it and could take much of the credit for its success. The Carolingian royalty supported this intellectual growth for two reasons: a general appreciation of the pursuit of knowledge and a desire to properly standardize religious life and prayer.  Organization  Using the Liber glossarum, a medieval scholar was able to look up the meaning of an individual word and find numerous synonyms. Such a scholar could also study information about a specific topic. Most copies of the Liber glossarum were organized into hundreds of pages each containing upwards of 40 lines of written text. Each column contained alphabetized entries of individual words and their respective definitions.  Known Manuscripts  Known copies of the Liber glossarum are mostly scattered throughout France and Germany. Huglo, Michel. \\"Les Arts Liberaux Dans Le ‚ÄòLiber Glossarum‚Äô\\" in Scriptorium. 2001.

It runs east‚Äìwest in southeast Wisconsin from Pewaukee to Shorewood. Route description In Milwaukee, WIS 190 is known as Capitol Drive, one of the main streets of the city's north side. The road's name comes from older mapping methods that discerned the road would lead directly toward the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison if built in a straight east-west line from Lake Michigan, though current day mapping actually places it two miles north of downtown Madison. The designation is carried all the way west to Pewaukee and its terminus just west of its interchange with WIS 16 in the Village of Pewaukee. WI 190 officially ends at the intersection with Simmons Avenue in Pewaukee, a block south of the post office. It begins again just west of Pewaukee initially under the name Lisbon Avenue and finally ends as West Capitol drive at the western end of Hartland. Capitol Drive is the main street for downtown Hartland. Although much of the original road has been changed into new roads or gone completely, remnants of it are still visible under different names. This is especially true of roads adjacent to WIS 16 until its end as a freeway in Oconomowoc. Harley- Davidson Plant The Harley-Davidson Motorcycle middle-weight engine assembly plant and Product Development Center (PDC) are located at the intersection of WIS 190 and US Highway 45/Interstate 41 in Milwaukee. The entrance to the plant and to the PDC is accessible by off-ramp from the western section of Capitol Drive's interchange with US 45/I-41. Due to the proximity of the I-41 freeway with the plant entrance, the interchange is a unique three-level diamond interchange with an access road connecting the plant to both highways. History WIS 190 was designated in 1947 along a segment of the former US 16 east from Pewaukee. The routing assigned to WIS 190 has remained unchanged other than upgrades along Capitol Drive and the removal of a small portion through downtown Pewaukee to end the road at the WIS 16 freeway .

Batumi (formerly Batum) is a city on the Black Sea coast and capital of Adjara, an autonomous republic in southwest Georgia. The city was under Russian rule at the beginning of World War I, but local unrest led to Turkey entering the city in April 1918, followed by the British in December, who stayed until July 1920. History During the British occupation, the stock of postage stamps started to run out, and so in February 1919 the administration produced its own stamps. These were imperforate, depicted an aloe tree and were inscribed –ë–ê–¢–£–ú–°–ö–ê–Ø –ü–û–ß–¢–ê (BATUMSKAYA POCHTA), or \\"Batum Post.\\" Aloe tree stamp, 1919 (forgery). 50 rubles on 2 kopeck stamp of imperial Russia, 1919 (forged overprint). The British later overprinted these with \\"BRITISH OCCUPATION\\", and surcharged the remaining Russian stamps in a variety of styles. Inflation also took hold, and by 1920, the tree stamps, which had been as little as 5 kopecks, had to be reprinted in denominations up to 50 rubles. Despite the short period of British rule, the tree stamps exist in large numbers, but the overprinted Russian stamps are not common, and in 2003 some commanded prices of over US$500.

Built by Arrow Dynamics, it opened in 1977 as the first roller coaster in the world to feature two consecutive vertical loops. The roller coaster operated until the park closed permanently in 2007, and it was later sold for scrap at an auction a year later. History Riding on the heels of successful innovations like Corkscrew at Knott's Berry Farm, which in 1975 was the first modern looping roller coaster in the world, Utah-based Arrow Dynamics was hired by Geauga Lake amusement park to design and build another industry first. Simply entitled Double Loop, the new design would become the first roller coaster in the world to feature back-to-back vertical loops. It was introduced at the park in 1977 at a total cost of $1.35 million. The ride featured a , a helix, of track, and two vertical loops with one measuring in height and the other measuring . Double Loop would be followed by the park's very own Corkscrew roller coaster ‚Äì one of fourteen identical installations eventually produced by Arrow ‚Äì which opened the following year in 1978. Both gave Geauga Lake the title of becoming the first amusement park to feature multiple looping roller coasters. Double Loop's support structure was originally painted white but would later be painted dark to match the track. The attraction debuted with two trains, one red and the other yellow. In 1993, the coaster underwent refurbishment adding some modernization to the control system. The outdated relay and photo eye controls were replaced with newer PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) and proximity switches to help improve reliability and to reduce downtime. Following Geauga Lake's acquisition by Six Flags, Double Loop was given a makeover in 2000, with a new paint scheme featuring a yellow track and purple supports. The yellow train was repainted a darker shade of yellow, while the red train was converted to purple. Track layout After exiting the station, the train made a 180-degree left-hand turn inside a tunnel and into the lift hill element. The train then descended at a 45-degree angle , followed by an incline and another 180-degree turn to the left. It would then drop into two consecutive vertical loops, followed by a slight ascent into a 360-degree downward helix before returning to the station. Auction Following Geauga Lake's permanent closure in 2007, Double Loop was sold at auction ‚Äì along with other former park rides ‚Äì on June 17, 2008. A local scrap company purchased it for $23,000, and the coaster was later demolished.

A member of the Network of Sacred Heart Schools, it offers a college preparatory curriculum for girls. Duchesne, which enrolls girls from pre-K3 to the 12th grade, is part of the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston and the Independent Schools Association of the Southwest. Duchesne is in the Memorial area and is east of the city of Hunters Creek Village. History Commencement of the class of 2008 Duchesne was established in September 1960 as a part of the Network of Sacred Heart Schools, with 58 high-school pupils. The school is named after Saint Rose Philippine Duchesne, the first member of the Society of the Sacred Heart to come to America. The school is part of the Network of Sacred Heart Schools. The campus was built around a large oak tree, in the center of its campus. It became a symbol for the school because the name \\"Duchesne\\" is French for \\"of the oak\\". The oak tree also represents a notable tradition at Duchesne, graduation. As each senior is called up to receive her diploma, she passes under the oak tree. On September 17, 2014, the original oak tree fell during a thunderstorm; however, it was over fifty years old and had been weakened after surviving a severe drought. On February 17, 2015, a new oak tree was transported by crane to a location near where the old oak tree previously stood and is currently still standing. The new oak tree allows the graduation tradition to continue for many years to come. Another fixture of the campus is a two-story white house that stood on the property when it was purchased for the school. It faces the oak tree and houses the RSCJ who live on campus. Some of the school's classes were originally conducted here. Student life The school is divided into three divisions: the Lower School, Middle School, and Upper School. The school has an annual tradition known as Cong√© - a day where classes are canceled and the Senior class organizes games and activities for the entire school to participate in.

She is best known as one of the architects (with Ronald Kaplan) of the theoretical framework of Lexical- Functional Grammar. After graduating from Reed College in 1966 with a degree in philosophy, Bresnan earned her doctorate in linguistics in 1972 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she studied with Noam Chomsky. In the early and mid 1970s, her work focused on complementation and wh-movement constructions within transformational grammar, and she frequently took positions at odds with those espoused by Chomsky. Her dissatisfaction with transformational grammar led her to collaborate with Kaplan on a new theoretical framework, Lexical-Functional Grammar (or LFG). A volume of papers written in the new framework and edited by Bresnan, entitled The Mental Representation of Grammatical Relations, appeared in 1982. Since then, Bresnan's work has focused on LFG analyses of various phenomena, primarily in English, Bantu languages, and Australian languages. She has also worked on analyses in optimality theory, and has pursued statistical approaches to linguistics. She has a strong interest in linguistic typology, which has influenced the development of LFG. Additional research interests of hers include dynamics of probabilistic grammar and empirical foundations of syntax. In pursuit of the latter, she established Stanford's Spoken Syntax Lab.  Honors  Joan Bresnan was a Guggenhiem Fellow in 1975-6 and a Fellow, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford in 1982-3. She served as the president of the Linguistic Society of America in 1999. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2004. She was honored in August 2005 with a festschrift entitled Architectures, Rules, and Preferences: A Festschrift for Joan Bresnan, published by CSLI Publications in December 2007. During periods in 2009-2012 she visited Freiburg for collaborative research as an External Fellow at the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies. She was elected a Fellow of the Cognitive Science Society in 2012. She was elected as a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy in 2015. In 2016, she was selected as the ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) Lifetime Achievement Award winner.  Teaching  In addition to Dr. Bresnan's current position at Stanford, she has also taught at University of Massachusetts at Amherst and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a member of the faculty.

Frances Gardiner Davenport in which Spain recognised the sovereignty of Portugal's new ruling dynasty, the House of Braganza. The regent of Spain, Queen Mariana of Austria, second wife of the late King Philip IV, acting in the name of her young son, Carlos II, oversaw the negotiation on the behalf of Spain. The prince-regent of Portugal, Pedro, future King Peter II of Portugal, in the name of his incapacitated brother, Afonso VI, represented Portugal. The peace was mediated by Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich, an ambassador of Charles II of England. Background By 1640, the Habsburg king, Philip IV of Spain (Philip III of Portugal), could no longer count on the trust, support or loyalty of most Portuguese nobles. The country was overtaxed, and Portuguese colonies had been left unprotected. Portugal, like many of Philip's domains, was on the verge of open rebellion. After 60 years of living under the rule of Spanish kings, a small band of conspirators in Lisbon rebelled and the Duke of Braganza was acclaimed King of Portugal as John IV on 1 December 1640,Portugal by Henry Morse Stephens taking advantage of a simultaneous revolt in Catalonia and Spain's ongoing conflict with France. Thus began the 28-year Portuguese Restoration War. At first, Portugal lost many of its colonial possessions to the opportunistic Dutch. Portugal's military strength was reserved for protecting its own frontiers against Spanish incursions, but after 1648, the end of the Thirty Years' War allowed the reversal of those misfortunes.A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion, 1400‚Äì1668 by M. D. D. Newitt Portugal regained its colonies in Angola, S√£o Tom√© and Brazil by 1654. In 1652, Catalonia's rebellion against Spain collapsed, and in 1659, Spain ended its war with France and so there were grounds for Spanish optimism in the struggle to regain control over Portugal. However, Portugal could draw on the wealth of Brazil and the aid of first France and then England, but Spain's finances were perpetually in crisis. A series of successes by the Portuguese, with the help of a British brigade, made it clear that the Iberian Peninsula would not be reunited under Spanish rule. The first took place on 8 June 1663, when the count of Vila Flor, Sancho Manoel de Vilhena, with Marshal Schomberg by his side, utterly defeated John of Austria the Younger, an illegitimate son of Philip IV, at the Battle of Ameixial, before he retook √âvora, which had been captured earlier that year. One year later, on 7 July 1664, Pedro Jacques de Magalh√£es, a local military leader, defeated the Duke of Osuna at Ciudad Rodrigo in the Salamanca Province of Spain. Finally, on 17 June 1665, the marquis of Marialva and Schomberg destroyed a Spanish army, under the Marquis of Caracena at the Battle of Montes Claros, followed by defeat at Vila Vi√ßosa. The Spanish failed to gain any compensating advantage. A year later, desperate to reduce its military commitments at almost any price, Spain accepted the loss of the Crown of Portugal. A treaty was signed between England and Spain at Madrid in 1667. As a result, England mediated the Treaty of Lisbon, which recognised the sovereignty of the House of Braganza.A History of Spain by Simon Barton Terms The fundamental terms of the treaty were: * The Spanish Habsburgs recognised the legitimacy of the Braganza dynasty in Portugal. Infanta Catarina, Duchess of Braganza (1540‚Äì1614), former Duchess of Braganza and grandmother of Jo√£o IV of Portugal, was retroactively acknowledged as a legitimate heir to the throne. * Portuguese sovereignty over its colonial possessions was reconfirmed except for the African exclave of Ceuta, a city that did not recognize the House of Braganza as the new ruling dynasty. * Agreements on the exchange of prisoners, reparations and the restoration of commercial relations were reached.Economy and Society in Baroque Portugal, 1668‚Äì1703 by Carl A. Hanson * Portugal ceded Ceuta to Spain. Seven years earlier, the nearby city of Tangiers had been awarded to King Charles II of England, as part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza, as was stipulated in the Treaty of Lisbon of 1661. Consequences The treaty had advantages for both countries. Spain, relieved to be ending a financially ruinous war, was quite pliant in the negotiations. Also, Portugal could now pursue the possession of its overseas colonies. Aftermath After 1668, Portugal, determined to differentiate itself from Spain, turned to Western Europe, particularly France and England, for new ideas and skills. That was part of a gradual \\"de-Iberianization\\", as Portugal consolidated its cultural and political independence from Spain. Portuguese nationalism, which was aroused by success on the battlefield, produced hostile reactions to Spanish things and persons. By then, Portuguese society was composed of two basic elements: those who participated in the gradual Europeanization process, the \\"political nation\\", and those who remained largely unchanged, the majority of the people, who remained apolitical and passive.Republican Portugal: A Political History, 1910‚Äì1926 by Douglas L. Wheeler Portugal's restoration of independence freed it to pursue the course mapped out by the pioneers of commercial imperialism. During the 17th century, its economy depended largely upon entrep√¥t trade in tobacco and sugar and the export of salt. During the 18th century, even though staples were not abandoned, the Portuguese economy came to be based more upon slaves, gold, leather and wine. Portuguese trade, centted in the busy port of Lisbon, was influenced especially by Anglo-Dutch capitalism and by the colonial economy in Brazil.The Making of Modern Europe, 1648‚Äì1780 References Lisbon Lisbon Treaties involving territorial changes 1668 in Portugal 1668 treaties Lisbon Treaties of the Spanish Empire Portugal‚ÄìSpain relations History of Ceuta Portuguese Restoration War 1668 in Spain ","title":"Treaty of Lisbon (1668)"},{"id":"6434930","text":"Internal mechanism of the Brandtaucher submarine in Dresden The Brandtaucher submarine cutaway model in Dresden, Germany Sketch of the Brandtaucher (from an 1896 book) Brandtaucher (German for Fire-diver) was a submersible designed by the Bavarian inventor and engineer Wilhelm Bauer and built by Schweffel & Howaldt in Kiel for Schleswig-Holstein's Flotilla (part of the Reichsflotte) in 1850. The Brandtaucher is the oldest known surviving submarine in the world.  History  In January 1850 Bauer, a cavalryman during the German-Danish War, designed Brandtaucher as a way to end the Danish naval blockade of Germany. Bauer's early sketch attracted the attention of the Minister of Marine, who allowed him to construct a model. The model was demonstrated in Kiel harbour in front of naval dignitaries. Its satisfactory performance led to the construction of a full-scale model, which was funded by contributions from army personnel and local civilians. Due to the inadequate funding, the scale of the boat had to be downgraded and the design altered and simplified; resulting in a reduced diving depth from 30 m to 9.5 m. This redesign included eliminating the use of enclosed ballast tanks to contain the water being taken into and expelled from the submarine. Instead, the water was allowed to pool inside the bottom of the hull, below the main floor, and was able to move relatively unobstructed within this area when the ship changed orientation. The resulting instability was probably a significant contributing factor to the loss of the vessel. As built, Brandtaucher was 8.07 m long and 2.02 m at maximum beam, with a draught of 2.63 m. It was propelled by a crew of three turning large tread wheels connected to a propeller. The boat could reach a speed of three knots, but this could not be maintained for long periods of time. On 1 February 1851, Brandtaucher sank after a diving accident during acceptance trials in Kiel Harbour. The submarine experienced equipment failure, and sank to the bottom of a 60-foot hole at the bottom of Kiel Harbour. Bauer escaped by letting in water, thus increasing the air pressure, which allowed Bauer and his two companions to open the hatch and swim to the surface. This was the first submarine escape to be witnessed and reported. In 1887 the wreck was discovered, and it was raised on 5 July 1887. Brandtaucher was first placed on display at the Naval Academy in Kiel and then in 1906 it was moved to the Museum f√ºr Meereskunde in Berlin. From 1963 to 1965 it was restored in the GDR at Rostock, and placed on display at the Nationale Volksarmee Museum in Potsdam. The boat can now be viewed at the Milit√§rhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr (German Armed Forces Museum of Military History), in Dresden.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 1, 2011 continuing through Neptune Township and Wall Township. The river continues towards the Shark River Inlet, an estuary that feeds into the Atlantic Ocean between Belmar and Avon-by-the-Sea.  History  Originally called Nolletquesset by the Lenni Lenape Indians, the name Shark River appears on the 1686 John Reid manuscript map of East Jarsey which is the earliest existing detailed map of Monmouth County. Due to the location of the county poor farm in what is now Shark River Hills, the river and surrounding area was given the nickname of Shirk River due to the shiftless folks lazing about on the banks of the river near the poor farm. \\"Shack River\\" was also derogatorily used in describing the area in relation to the shacks and shanties in which the poor shirkers dwelled in. Revolutionary soldiers gave the nickname of Hogs Pond to the area as wild hogs roamed freely throughout the woods near the salt works there. One 1812 map of New Jersey has Shark River titled as \\"White Creek\\" in reference to the White family who founded the Whitesville section of Neptune. River or bay There is some disagreement about the Shark River actually being a river, as it closely resembles a tidal basin: a tidal, salt water region separated from the open sea by a land formation, or barrier, and primarily influenced by oceanic tidal fluctuations. The area commonly referred to as the Shark River (not the inlet with its bulkhead) is actually a small bay of approximately eight hundred acres which includes the confluence of four fresh water streams, adjacent mud flats, salt marshes, the open water, and the inlet which connects the bay to the Atlantic Ocean. The term \\"river\\" generally refers to an aquatic entity that sustains a substantial amount of moving fresh water. The primary tributaries supplying fresh water to the Shark River tidal basin are; Shark River Stream, Jumping Brook; Musquash Brook, and Laurel Brook. These four streams, while draining a sizable watershed, only provide a negligible amount of fresh water to the basin when compared to the large amounts of salt water entering via the normal tidal fluctuation. This small amount of fresh water entering the bay, the relatively small size of the bay itself, and the substantial amounts of salt water that enters the bay (via the inlet), better describes the Shark River as a \\"tidal basin\\" than a river.Belmar Website, Residents > Municipal Boards > Environmental Commission > Natural Resources, Zone 5, http://www.belmar.com/Default.asp?Section_ID=623 The river (or stream) travels through sediments deposited during the Late Eocene and Middle Miocene periods.

The Fleet Marine Forces provide the National Command Authority (NCA) with a responsive force that can conduct operations in any spectrum of conflict around the globe. Organization The Fleet Marine Forces (FMF) consists of Marine Corps' operating forces components that constitute the Fleet Marine Forces on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, or within its \\"designate(s)\\". While the FMF is a Marine Corps organization, the FMF is a type command under the operational control of Navy fleet commanders; the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) retains administrative and training control. The Commanding General of the Fleet Marine Force; either its Pacific (CG FMFPAC) or Atlantic (CG FMFLANT) command, are responsible for the administration and training of all of the subordinate units of the Marine Corps Forces (MARCORFOR). The subordinate units of the Fleet Marine Forces come under the operational control of the commanders, U.S. Fleet Forces Command (formerly Atlantic Fleet) or United States Pacific Fleet, when deployed. The commanders of Marine Forces Command (MARFORCOM) and Pacific (MARFORPAC) serve as Marine Corps component commanders to their respective combatant commanders and may also serve as commanding generals of Fleet Marine Forces (FMFs) Atlantic, or Pacific. The operating forces of the Marine Corps are currently organized into two Fleet Marine Forces (FMF): * Fleet Marine Force, Pacific (FMFPAC) with headquarters in Honolulu, Hawaii * Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic (FMFLANT) with headquarters in Norfolk, Virginia. Each FMF is equivalent to a U.S. Navy type command and reports to its respective Fleet Commander-in-Chief. The commanding general‚Äîa lieutenant general‚Äîmay be either an aviator or a ground officer. His deputy commanding general is from the other community. Marine Corps forces are organized into warfighting units of combined arms known as Marine Air Ground Task Forces (MAGTFs) and are either employed as part of naval expeditionary forces or separately as part of larger joint or combined forces. Each FMF consists of at least one Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) consisting of at least one Marine Division (MARDIV), one Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW), one Marine Logistics Group (MLG) (formerly the Force Service Support Group (FSSG)), and an MEF Information Group. Other miscellaneous supporting units may be attached. In addition to one or more MEF(s), each FMF is further organized into one or more intermediate-sized MAGTFs called Marine Expeditionary Brigades (MEBs) and smaller MAGTFs called Marine Expeditionary Units (MEUs). History Its predecessor was the Advanced Base Force in the early 20th century. The history of the FMF dates to December 7, 1933, when Secretary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson issued General Order 241 defining the Fleet Marine Force.Claude A. Swanson, Secretary of the Navy The Fleet Marine Force, General Order No. 241 (Norfolk, VA: Dept. of the Navy, December 7, 1933). Momentarily before and during World War II, the Fleet Marine Force had FMF units also in western Pacific assigned to the United States Asiatic Fleet, establishing the Fleet Marine Force, Western Pacific (FMFWestPac). Navy personnel in the Fleet Marine Forces Fleet Marine Force Enlisted Warfare Specialist Device. For service in the Fleet Marine Force, the United States Department of the Navy issues the FMF Enlisted Warfare Specialist Insignia and the FMF Qualified Officer Insignia (formerly, the Fleet Marine Force Ribbon was issued). Navy Fleet Marine Force personnel, usually Corpsmen, Religious Program Specialists or Naval Gunfire Liaison Officers who participate in amphibious assaults, are also eligible to receive the FMF Combat Operations Insignia to certain service medals and ribbons.

History WIS 241 was created in 1999 when state highway officials decided to reroute US 41 off South 27th Street in Milwaukee.

It is a pastiche featuring the characters of the Sherlock Holmes series of books written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The film credits the 1899 play, Sherlock Holmes by William Gillette as the source material for the movie script, though there is little resemblance in the plots. The picture is the second installment to the series of fourteen Sherlock Holmes film series released between 1939 and 1946, the first being The Hound of the Baskervilles, and the second picture to feature Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. John Watson. It was the final Holmes film produced by Fox and the last in the Rathbone/Bruce series to be set in the original Victorian London period. The further twelve films produced by Universal Pictures and starring Rathbone/Bruce would take place in contemporaneous times (i.e., the 1940s). George Zucco stars as Holmes's nemesis, Professor Moriarty. The picture follows famous detective Sherlock Holmes and his assistant Doctor Watson as they attempt to foil their archenemy Professor Moriarty, who targets a wealthy family and plots the theft of the Crown Jewels. Background The film was supposedly based on the stage play by William Gillette, though little of the play's original plot remains aside from the Holmes/Moriarty conflict. The play featured a very young Charlie Chaplin in one of his very first acting roles during its first London production, playing the character of Billy, who, in this movie, is played by Terry Kilburn. Plot The film is set in 1894. The picture begins with Moriarty and Holmes verbally sparring on the steps outside the Old Bailey, where Moriarty has just been acquitted on a charge of murder owing to lack of evidence. Holmes remarks, \\"You have a magnificent brain, Moriarty. I admire it. I admire it so much I'd like to present it, pickled in alcohol, to the London Medical Society.\\" \\"It would make an impressive exhibit,\\" replies Moriarty. Holmes and Watson are visited at 221B Baker Street by Ann Brandon (Ida Lupino). She tells him that her brother Lloyd has received a strange note: a drawing of a man with an albatross hanging around his neck, identical to one received by her father just before his brutal murder ten years before. Holmes deduces that the note is a warning and rushes to find Lloyd Brandon. He is too late, as Lloyd has been murdered by being strangled and having his skull crushed. Holmes, disguised as a music-hall entertainer, attends a garden party, where he correctly believes an attempt will be made on Ann's life. Hearing her cries from a nearby park, he captures her assailant, who turns out to be Gabriel Mateo, out for revenge on the Brandons for the murder of his father by Ann's father in a dispute over ownership of their South American mine. His murder weapon was a bolas. Mateo also reveals that it was Moriarty who urged him to seek revenge. Holmes realises that Moriarty is using the case as a distraction from his real crime, a crime that will stir the British Empire: an attempt to steal the Crown Jewels. Holmes rushes to the Tower of London, where, during a struggle, Moriarty falls, presumably to his death. In the end, Ann is married and Holmes tries to shoo a fly by playing the violin, only to have Watson swat it with his newspaper, remarking, \\"Elementary, my dear Holmes, elementary.\\"Davies, David Stuart, Holmes of the Movies (New English Library, 1976) Cast * Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes * Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson * Ida Lupino as Ann Brandon * George Zucco as Professor Moriarty * Alan Marshal as Jerrold Hunter * Terry Kilburn as Billy * Henry Stephenson as Sir Ronald Ramsgate * E.

Influence The quote \\"Elementary, my dear Watson\\" was made popular by this film. Although it was spoken in the 1929 talkie The Return of Sherlock Holmes starring Clive Brook, it was never featured in a canonical Arthur Conan Doyle story, although once Holmes said, in the 1893 story \\"The Adventure of the Crooked Man\\", \\"Elementary\\". During the scene in which Holmes crashes the garden party dressed as a music hall performer, he sings \\"I Do Like To be Beside the Seaside\\". This is an anachronism, since the film is set in 1894 but the song was written in 1907. The scene in which Holmes experiments with the flies in the glass while playing the violin is recreated in the 2009 film Sherlock Holmes, in which Holmes is played by Robert Downey Jr. In the episode \\"The Reichenbach Fall\\" of the BBC/PBS series Sherlock is heavily inspired by the film and other Rathbone-Bruce films (creators Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss have named the films as the show's primarily inspiration).

She was of the VC2-S-AP5 Victory ship design type. Haskell was named for the Haskell Counties of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.  World War II service  Haskell was launched 13 June 1944 by California Shipbuilding Corp., Wilmington, California, under Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. W. L. Friedell, wife of the Commandant of the 11th Naval District; and commissioned 11 September 1944, Comdr. A. L. Mare in command. Following her shakedown cruise, Haskell arrived San Francisco 19 October and began loading troops and supplies destined for the Pacific. Underway 28 October, she set course for Finschafen, New Guinea, and arrived 15 November 1944. Four days later the transport anchored at Biak Island to unload her troops, who were to take part in the developing New Guinea offensive. Haskell sailed via Mios Woendi to Noemfoor Island, 23 November-2 December, where preparations were underway for the important landings at Lingayen Gulf, Philippines. At staging areas throughout the western Pacific ships such as Haskell loaded troops and made practice landings prior to the actual assault. After exercises at Japen Island, Haskell departed in convoy for the Philippines 4 January 1945. A part of Rear Admiral Conolly's reinforcement echelon, Haskell and the other transports arrived off Lingayen Gulf 11 January 2 days after the initial landings. Haskell's group escaped attack while sailing the treacherous route through the Philippines. After unloading her troops and cargo, Haskell departed the next day, but not before her gunners had shot down their first enemy aircraft during an air raid on the 11th. The transport sailed to Leyte Gulf 15 January 1945, loaded troops, and took part in a practice landing at Tacloban, Leyte. The ship departed with Rear Admiral Struble's amphibious group 26 January for the Zambales landing north of Subic Bay, Luzon. This unopposed landing was carried out 3 days later and helped to cut off the Bataan Peninsula and hasten the fall of Manila. Haskell returned to Leyte Gulf 1 February 1945. With control of the Philippines secured, Haskell was next assigned to the giant Okinawa operation. She completed loading troops and supplies at Leyte 13 March 1945 and after amphibious exercises sailed 27 March for Okinawa. This massive invasion, climax of the Pacific island-hopping campaign, began 1 April. Haskell was a member of Rear Admiral Hall's Southern Attack Force, and debarked units of the 7th Division with their equipment during the first waves of the assault. During the first days of the bitter struggle she also served as an emergency hospital ship and cared for many casualties at her off shore anchorage. After unloading her troops and cargo, the transport sailed 6 April for Saipan, Marianas, thus escaping the heavy Japanese air counterattacks so valiantly endured by the ships remaining at Okinawa. Stopping at Saipan only briefly, Haskell steamed independently via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor to San Francisco, where she arrived 1 May. The ship underwent needed repairs and embarked Navy and Coast Guard personnel for the Pacific and sailed the 23d for Noumea. Arriving 9 June 1945, the ship began a series of transport voyages to various ports in the Pacific, providing men and cargo at Guadalcanal, Eniwetok, and Guam. She arrived Apra Harbor, Guam, 1 July and embarked 83 Japanese prisoners of war for transfer to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived 15 July. From Pearl Harbor Haskell sailed to San Francisco 22 July and Seattle 12 August. While Haskell loaded at Seattle the war ended, and she assumed a new role, that of bringing occupation troops to the Pacific and transporting returnees to the United States. She sailed 20 August for Okinawa and after stops at Eniwetok and Ulithi arrived 11 September and unloaded her troops. Soon afterward, 16 September, the ship was forced to put to sea to ride out the giant typhoon which swept the area and after 2 days of grueling heavy weather returned to Okinawa. Haskell's role was as a transport for over 1,400 allied prisoners of war released from enemy prison camps. These wasted veterans were offloaded at Manila 25 September, and the ship sailed for the United States 1 October, with 1,800 members of the \\"Eastern Air Forces\\" [possibly the Far Eastern or 5th Air Force -ed]. After a stop at Eniwetok, Haskell arrived San Francisco 19 October 1945. As a unit of the \\"Magic-Carpet\\" fleet Haskell made two more voyages to the Far East during the gigantic task of returning American servicemen to their homes. These passages, to Okinawa and Japan, terminated with Haskells arrival at Seattle, Wash., 2 February 1946. Designated for return to the Maritime Commission, the ship sailed to Norfolk, Virginia, via the Panama Canal, and arrived 21 March 1946. Haskell decommissioned 22 May 1946 and was returned 2 days later and placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at James River, Virginia.  Fate  Ex-Haskell was removed from the Reserve Fleet in 1956 for a Repair Program, GAA-Moore McCormick Lines. Upon her return from the Repair Program she was berthed at Wilmington, North Carolina, On 1 March 1965 when she transferred back to James River, Virginia. On 26 June 1973, she was sold to Alberti Equipment, Incorporated, for $124,630, for scrapping. At 1040 EDT, on 30 July 1973 she was withdrawn from the Reserve Fleet and sent to the breaker's yard. All that remains of Haskell is her brass builder's plate.  Awards  Haskell received two battle stars for World War II service.

The differing opinions mostly revolve around issues such as the home of the earliest ancestors of the medieval Rashtrakutas, a possible southern migration during the early part of the first millennium and the relationship between the several Rashtrakuta dynasties that ruled small kingdoms in northern and central India and the Deccan in the 6th century - 7th century. Further, the relationship of these medieval Rashtrakutas to the most important and famous dynasty, the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta of the 8th century - 10th century time period has also been debated. Also contested is whether the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta were related by ancestry to the early Kannada, Maratha, Rajput, Reddi or Punjabi communities of the Deccan and northern India. While the history of the early Rashtrakutas has caused much debate, the history of the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta (in present-day Gulbarga) of the 8th‚Äì10th centuries can be accurately constructed because numerous contemporaneous inscriptions and texts refer to them. The crux of the Manyakheta empire extended from the Kaveri river in the south to the Narmada in the north. At their peak they were the only south Indian empire that conquered regions in far northern India (Kannauj) as well as the extreme south (Tamilakam). The Lata branch of the empire (in present-day Gujarat) was an important dynasty belonging to the Manyakheta family line which later merged with the Manyakheta kingdom during the 9th century. Research Sources The study of the history of the early Rashtrakutas and the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta has been made possible by the availability of numerous inscriptions spread all over the Deccan, ancient literature in Pali,Reu 1933 p1 contemporaneous Kannada literature such as Kavirajamarga (850) and Vikramarjuna Vijaya (941), Sanskrit writings by Somadeva, Rajashekara, Gunabhadra, Jinasena and others and the notes of Arab travellers of those times such as Suleiman, Ibn Haukal, Al Masudi, Al Istakhri and others.Kamath (2001), p72 Scholars have left no topic unstudied in an effort to accurately propose the history of the Rashtrakutas. Theories about their lineage (Surya Vamsa or Chandra Vamsa), native region and ancestral home have been proposed using clues from inscriptions, royal emblems, ancient clan names such as \\"Rashtrika\\", epithets such as Ratta, Rashtrakuta, Lattalura Puravaradhiswara, names of royalty, coins and contemporaneous literature.Reu (1933) pp1-15Kamath (2001), p72-74 These theories from noted scholars have resulted in claims that the Rashtrakutas were from either Rajput,J. F. Fleet (author of Dynasties of Canarese Districts of Bombay Presidency, 1896) in Reu 1933, p6 Kannadiga,A.S. Altekar (1934), pp21-26S.U. Kamath in Kamath 2001, p72-73Dalby (1998), p300Chopra, Ravindran, Subrahmanian (2003), p87Reddi,A.C. Burnell in Reu 1933, p4 Maratha,C.V. Vaidya (author of History of Mediaeval Hindu India : Being a History of India from 600 to 1200 AD) and D.R.Bhandarkar in Reu 1933, p1, p7 or PunjabiHultzsch and Reu in (Reu 1933, p2, p4) origin. Epithets The appearance of the terms Rathika, Ristika (Rashtrika) or Lathika in conjunction with the terms Kambhoja and Gandhara in some Ashokan inscriptions of the 2nd century BCE from Mansera and Shahbazgarhi in North Western Frontier Province (present day Pakistan), Girnar (Saurashtra) and Dhavali (Kalinga) and the use of the epithet \\"Ratta\\" in many later inscriptions had prompted a claim by Reu that the earliest Rashtrakutas were descendants of the Arattas, natives of the Punjab region mentioned in the text of Mahabharata who later migrated south and set up kingdoms there,Hultzsch in Reu 1933, p2 while another theory of J.H. Fleet points more generally to north western regions of India.J.H.Fleet in (Reu 1933, p6) Based on this theory, the Arattas may have become natives of the Deccan having arrived there during the early centuries of the first millennium.Reu (1933), p7 This is counter to the argument by other scholars that the term Rishtika used together with Petenika in the Ashokan inscriptions implied they were hereditary ruling clans from modern Maharashtra regionD.R.Bhandarkar in Reu 1933, p1, p7 and the term \\"Ratta\\" implied Maharatta ruling families from modern Maharashtra region.C.V.Vaidya in Reu 1933, p1, p7 But this has been rejected on the basis that from ancient books such as Dipavamsha and Mahavamsha in Pali language it is known the term Maharatta and not Rashtrika has been used to signify hereditary ruling clans from modern Maharashtra region and the terms Rashtrika and Petenika appear to be two different displaced ruling tribes.B.N. Reu claims Dr C.V. Vaidya has made an assumption that the Rashtrakutas have lived in the Maharashtra region from the time of King Ashoka simply based on availability of Ashokan inscriptions from that region while inscriptions from other parts of the empire such as Saurashtra, Kalinga and North West also use such clan names. He has further argued that Rashtrika and Petenika are not one term but two separate terms in (Reu 1933, p1, p7) It is noted by another scholar that ruling clans called Rathis and Maharathis were in power in parts of present-day Karnataka as well in the early centuries of the Christian era, which is known inscriptions from the region and further proven by the discovery of lead coins from the middle of 3rd century bearing Sadakana Kalalaya Maharathi in the heart of modern Karnataka region near Chitradurga. In the face of these facts it is claimed it can no longer be maintained that the Rathi and Maharathi families were confined only to present day Maharashtra.Altekar (1934), pp20-21 It is claimed there is sufficient inscriptional evidence that several Maharathi families were related to Kannadiga families by marriage and they were naga worshippers, a form of worship very popular in the Mysore region (modern Karnataka). Also, no evidence to confirm that these families were either Aryan or non-Aryan is available.Altekar (1934), p25 The epithet Ratta, it is also claimed is a Kannada word from which the word Rashtrakuta has been derived. The use of the word Rattagudlu (meaning an office) has been found in inscriptions from present day Andhra Pradesh dated prior to the 8th century indicating it was a South Indian word. From the Deoli plates and Karhad records it is argued there was a prince called Ratta and his son was called Rashtrakuta. Hence it has been argued the Rashtrakutas were of Kannada origin.A.S. Altekar in Kamath 2001, p73 It is also said the term Rashtra means \\"kingdom\\" and Kuta means \\"lofty\\"Reu (1933), p4 or Rashtra means province and Kuta means chieftain. Another epithet used in inscriptions of Amoghavarsha I was Lattalura Puravaradhiswara. It is proposed that it refers to their original home Lattalur, modern day Latur in Maharashtra state, bordering Karnataka.J.H. Fleet in Kamath 2001, p72 This area it is claimed was predominantly Kannada speaking based on surviving vestiges of place names, inscriptions and cultural relics. It is explained that Latta is a Prakrit variation of Ratta and hence Rattana-ur became Lattana-ur and finally Lattalur.Altekar (1934), p23-24 Another theory is that Latalurapura is modern day Ratnapur in Bilaspur district of central India.According to Rajvade in Reu 1933, p7 Royal names and signatures In linking possible connections between the medieval Rashtrakuta families to the imperial family of Manyakheta it has been pointed out that only the family members ruling from Elichpur (Berar or modern Amravati district, modern Maharashtra) had names that were very similar to the names of Kings of the Manyakheta dynasty. From the Tivarkhed and Multhai inscriptions it is clear that the kings of this family were Durgaraja, Govindaraja, Svamikaraja and Nannaraja. These names closely resemble the names of Manyakheta kings or their extended family, the name Govindaraja appearing multiple times among the Manyakheta line. These names also appear in the Gujarat line of Rashtrakutas whose family ties with the Manyakheta family is well known.Altekar (1934), p8 It has been noted that princes and princesses of the Rashtrakuta family used pure Kannada names such as Kambarasa, Asagavve, Revakka and Abbalabbe as their personal names indicating that they were native Kannadigas. It has been pointed out that princesses of family lineage belonging to Gujarat signed their royal edicts in Kannada even in their Sanskrit inscriptions. Some examples of this are the Navsari and Baroda plates of Karka I and the Baroda plates of his son Dhruva II. It has been attested by a scholar that the Gujarat Rashtrakuta princes signed their inscriptions in the language of their native home and the race they belonged to.D.R. Bhandarkar in Kamath 2001, p73 It is well known that the Gujarat line of Rashtrakutas were from the same family as the Manyakheta line. It is argued that if the Rashtrakutas were originally a Marathi speaking family, then the Gujarat Rashtrakutas would not have signed their inscriptions in Kannada language and that too in far away Gujarat.Altekar (1934), p21 The theory that under the rule of the Badami Chalukyas of Kannada country, Kannada speaking dynasties were established in the far corners of the Chalukyan empire in Gujarat, Andhra and Berar (present day Vidharba region in modern Maharashtra) and hence the ancestors of King Dantidurga, the founder of the Manyakheta empire were Kannadigas. It is further claimed there is proof that in the locality where Dantidurga lived Kannada was the spoken language.Just as the later Maratha ruling families of Baroda, Indore, and Gwallior used their native language Marathi and script in their personal matters, so did the medieval Rashtrakutas preserve their native language Kannada when ruling from Berar- A.S. Altekar (1934), p22, p24 Emblems Several Rashtrakuta families ruled India during the 6th century - 7th century period. Scholars have tried to understand their relationship with the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta by a comparative study of the emblems. The only Rashtrakuta family whose royal emblem is similar to that of the rulers of Manyakheta, the golden eagle or Garuda lanchhana (emblem) is that of the family that ruled from Amravathi district of modern Maharashtra. It has been theorised that this line may possibly have been ancestors of the Manyakheta kings. Their inscriptions (Tivarkhed and Multhai) were issued from Achalapura (modern Elichpur) which may have been their capital. Another Rashtrakuta family ruling from Manapura with its founder King Abhimanyu had the emblem of a lion. This makes it improbable that they were the ancestors of the Manyakheta family.Altekar (1934), p6 The location of Manapura is uncertain. John Faithfull Fleet proposed its identification with Manpur in Malwa, and then with Manpur near Bandhavgarh, but later rejected both these theories himself.Epigraphia Indica (Volume 37, Part 1 - Page 12) Bhagawanlal Indraji identified it with Manyakheta (Malkhed) itself. Vasudev Vishnu Mirashi identified it with Man, Satara. While the Garuda is normally indicative Vaishnavite leanings, it has to be observed here that earlier coins belonging to King Krishna I's period use the legend Parama Maheshwara, which in turn indicate staunch Shaivite leanings. This change in symbology has been used to theorise that the Rashtrakutas may have originally been Shaivites and embraced Vaishnavism later.The emblem changed from Lion to Garuda later (Reu 1933, p14) Vamsha (genealogy) With regards to their vamsha (whether they belonged to Surya Vamsha (solar lineage) or Chandra Vamsha (lunar lineage), Rashtrakuta inscriptions remained silent on the issue, until about 860. Scholars have traced the lineage claims of Rashtrakutas from Satyaki branch of Yadu Vamsa. Over 75 inscriptions have been found thereafter in the Deccan and Gujarat which speak about their vamsha. Of these, 8 lay a direct claim that they belonged to the Yadava line descended from the Vrishni hero Satyaki. Rashtrakutas claim Vrishni Yadava lineage throughout their records. One inscription of 860 clearly states that King Dantidurga was born to the Yadava Satyaki, 1800 coins of King Krishna I (772). An inscription of King Govinda III (808) mentions \\"by the birth of this virtuous king, the Rashtrakuta dynasty became invincible just as the Yadava dynasty by the birth of Lord Krishna\\".Houben(1996), p215 Language While the linguistic leanings of the early Rashtrakutas (pre-8th century) has caused considerable debate, the history and language of the imperial Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta has been free of such confusion. It is clear from inscriptions, coinage and prolific contemporaneous literature that the court of these Rashtrakutas was multi- lingual, and used Sanskrit and Kannada as their administrative languagesPollock (2006), p332Houben(1996), p215 and encouraged literature in Sanskrit and Kannada.Kamath (2001), p73 Rashtrakuta inscriptions outside Karnataka are mostly in SanskritMasica (1991), p45-46Rashtrakutas were Kannadigas from Lattaluru who encouraged Kannada language (Chopra, Ravindran, Subrahmanian 2003, p87) However this period was the very end of the classical era of literary Sanskrit and Prakrit.Kamath (2001), p89 As such, from the Kavirajamarga of the 9th century, it is known that Kannada was popular from Kaveri river up to the Godavari river, an area covering large territory in modern Maharashtra.Sastri (1955), p355Rice, E.P. (1921), p12Rice, B.L. (1897), p497 The Rashtrakuta inscriptions call them the vanquishers of the Karnatabala, a sobriquet used to refer to the near invincibility of the Chalukyas of Badami. This however it is claimed should not be construed to mean that the Rashtrakutas themselves were not Kannadigas. Their patronage and love of the Kannada language is apparent in that most of their inscriptions within modern Karnataka are in Kannada, while their inscriptions outside of modern Karnataka tended to be in Sanskrit.Kamath (2001) p73 An inscription in classical Kannada of King Krishna III has also been found as far away as Jabalpur in modern Madhya Pradesh which further supports the view of their affinity to the language. Adikavi Pampa, Sri Ponna, Shivakotiacharya and King Amoghavarsha I were among the noteworthy scholars in Kannada,Kamath (2001), p90 the Apabhramsha poet Pushpadanta wrote several works and famous Sanskrit scholars such as Jinasena and Virasena (both of whom were theologians), mathematician Mahaviracharya and poets such as Trivikrama and Gunabhadra adorned their courts.Kamath (2001), pp88-89 The earliest extant Kannada literature belongs to this time.Narasimhacharya (1988), p2,p12,p18 These Rashtrakuta kings married princess from Northern and Southern India and several Rashtrakuta branches emerged in Northern India during their imperialistic expansion in the 9th century. The argument that the Rashtrakutas were either Marathi speaking Marathas or Telugu speaking Reddies in origin has been rejected. Reddy's in that time period had not come into martial prominence even in the Telugu speaking regions of Andhra, being largely an agrarian society of cultivators who only much later (in the 14th century - 15th century) came to control regions in the Krishna - Rajamundry districts.Altekar (1943), p18 The Rashtrakuta period did not produce any Marathi inscriptions or literature (with the exception of a 981 CE Shravanabelagola inscription which some historians argue was inscribed later).Altekar (1934), p412 In addition very few literary works in Prakrit language are available from this period. Jainism which played such an important role in giving patronage to early Kannada literature did not flourish as much in the present day Maharashtra region which is why no Marathi literature emerged during this period. Hence Marathi as the language of the Rashtrakutas, it is claimed, is not an acceptable argument.Altekar (1934), p413  See also  *Carnatic expansion Notes References     Rashtrakuta dynasty Rashtrakuta ","title":"Origin of Rashtrakuta Dynasty"},{"id":"6435175","text":"Jakubov (, ) is a village in Malacky District in the Bratislava Region of western Slovakia close to the town of Malacky, north-west of Slovakia's capital Bratislava.

History Pierre Monteux's (1875-1964) first forays into teaching the art of conducting occurred in 1932 in Paris, where he taught a conducting course during the summer. In 1936, he moved his classes to Les Beaux. After marrying the American Doris Hodgkins, he moved permanently to the United States in 1942, maintaining residences in San Francisco and in his wife's home town, Hancock, Maine. It was in this rural community that he and Doris established what was first known as L'√âcole Monteux, later to be known as the Domaine School, and finally, the Pierre Monteux School. In 2018, the name changed to the Monteux School and Music Festival. After Monteux's death, Maestro Charles Bruck took over leadership of the school. His prot√©g√©, Michael Jinbo, is the current music director and Maestro of the School. Events The Monteux School currently functions as both a school for conductors and orchestra musicians and a classical music festival for the surrounding community. The school is typically in session from mid-June through the end of July and offers a season of six orchestral concerts and five chamber music concerts. Student musicians come from conservatories and schools of music from around the world to study and perform in this setting. Philosophy The school's philosophy is still heavily influenced by the life and musicianship of Pierre Monteux. As a young man, Monteux made his living as a violinist and violist in Paris's very active musical scene. His belief was that conductors must come from within the orchestra; as such, all conductors who attend the school must play in the orchestra. Monteux's repertoire as a conductor was unusually broad for his era. Students at the Monteux School prepare a list of 60 orchestral works each summer, all of which are rehearsed or performed over the course of the six-week season. These range from Baroque/Early Classical through contemporary compositions. Traditions The school is noteworthy for a number of long-standing traditions. Excerpts from The Rite of Spring are played every summer in honor of Pierre Monteux's famous association with that work's premiere in 1913. Bastille Day, the French national holiday, is celebrated with a rendition of La Marseillaise on the 14th of July, reflecting the school's cultural roots. Music directors *Pierre Monteux (1943-1963) *Charles Bruck (1964-1995) *Michael Jinbo (1996-) Alumni Notable alumni include Lorin Maazel, Andr√© Previn, Sir Neville Marriner, David Zinman, Erich Kunzel, Charles Ansbacher, David Hayes, George Cleve, Richard Yardumian, Anshel Brusilow, Hugh Wolff, Pierre Rolland, Ludovic Morlot, and Werner Torkanowsky. Leon Fleisher, a student in Hancock during the school's first two years, returned in the summer of 2010 to conduct and play an all-Mozart benefit concert. Ludovic Morlot conducted Claude Debussy's Jeux (Games) on the Annual Memorial Concert during the 2018 summer season. Cultural references David Katz, one of Charles Bruck's longtime students at the Monteux School, has written a one-man play about the conductor and the institution he headed for 26 years. In July 2005, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Bruck's death, Katz premiered MUSE of FIRE at the Oceanside Meadows Theatre Barn in Prospect Harbor, Maine, and at the Acadia Repertory Theatre in Bar Harbor, both very close to where many of the events in the play took place. Katz has continued to tour the work, which highlights Bruck's intense and demanding teaching style, throughout the East, in Canada, and in an extended engagement in Chicago.

Camp history The camp housed women officers of the Armia Krajowa (\\"Home Army\\") captured after the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. It consisted of seven wooden barrack huts and an administration building, originally built in 1938 for slave labourers from nearby Buchenwald concentration camp who were working on the autobahn near Erfurt. The camp now came under the administrative command of Stalag IX-C near Bad Sulza. In December 1944, 380 women officers, 38 female orderlies, and three children were brought there from other POW camps: Stalag XI-B Fallingbostel, Stalag XI-B/Z Bergen-Belsen, Gross-Rosen, Stalag IV-E Altenburg, Stalag 344 Lamsdorf, and Stalag X-A Sandbostel. The Senior Polish Officer was Major Wanda Gertz. Major Wanda Gertz The camp was one of the worst Oflags operated by the German Army during the war. The officer in charge, Hauptmann, was reasonably well- disposed but seemingly incapable of improving the situation, according to the testimony of the prisoners. The camp was built on boggy ground, prone to flooding, and was always ankle-deep in thick mud. The wooden huts had been used only temporarily from 1938 to 1939 and then abandoned. As such, they were dilapidated and damp, and they were infested with bedbugs, mice, and rats. There was no heating in the barracks, and temperatures dropped to in the winter. Rations were poor, and although eventually some Red Cross packages were sent over from Stalag IX-C, the prisoners lacked any means of cooking, and they had to improvise as well as they could. They burnt paper, cardboard, and wood chips in empty tin cans to boil water, but this practice was soon prohibited by the camp authorities. Washing facilities were non-existent, and there was no hot water. Four Polish doctors did their best without instruments and few drugs, but respiratory diseases and malnourishment were endemic. The camp library consisted of just 105 books, mostly brought by the prisoners themselves. They had no access to a priest, and no religious services were held in the camp. On 6 February 1945 during a dogfight between two Allied aircraft and a German fighter overhead, two huts were hit by stray gunfire. One prisoner was killed, and sixteen others were wounded. A delegate of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Dr. H. Landolt, arrived on an inspection tour on 8 March 1945, accompanied by an officer of the German High Command. In his report, he stated: \\"this camp looks surprisingly like a concentration camp, not like any Oflag that I have seen.\\" The Germans promised to rectify the situation. However, less than a month later, on 5 April 1945, the prisoners were marched east to Blankenhain, where they were housed in a former Adolf Hitler School. Three days later, on 8 April, troops of the U.S. 89th Infantry Division entered the camp at Molsdorf and found that it contained only thirty prisoners who were too ill to march. Finally, on 13 April, the prisoners at Blankenhain were also liberated by the 89th Division. Other camps Between November 1939 and June 1940, the POW camp at Rotenburg an der Fulda in Hesse was designated Oflag IX-C. It then became a sub-camp (Zweiglager) of the camp at Spangenberg and was renamed Oflag IX-A/Z.

Sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine.  Examples  The objective and challenges of sentiment analysis can be shown through some simple examples.

Types  A basic task in sentiment analysis is classifying the polarity of a given text at the document, sentence, or feature/aspect level‚Äîwhether the expressed opinion in a document, a sentence or an entity feature/aspect is positive, negative, or neutral. Advanced, \\"beyond polarity\\" sentiment classification looks, for instance, at emotional states such as \\"angry\\", \\"sad\\", and \\"happy\\". Precursors to sentimental analysis include the General Inquirer,Stone, Philip J., Dexter C. Dunphy, and Marshall S. Smith. \\"The general inquirer: A computer approach to content analysis.\\" MIT Press, Cambridge, MA (1966). which provided hints toward quantifying patterns in text and, separately, psychological research that examined a person's psychological state based on analysis of their verbal behavior.Gottschalk, Louis August, and Goldine C. Gleser. The measurement of psychological states through the content analysis of verbal behavior. Univ of California Press, 1969. Subsequently, the method described in a patent by Volcani and Fogel, looked specifically at sentiment and identified individual words and phrases in text with respect to different emotional scales. A current system based on their work, called EffectCheck, presents synonyms that can be used to increase or decrease the level of evoked emotion in each scale. Many other subsequent efforts were less sophisticated, using a mere polar view of sentiment, from positive to negative, such as work by Turney, and Pang who applied different methods for detecting the polarity of product reviews and movie reviews respectively. This work is at the document level. One can also classify a document's polarity on a multi-way scale, which was attempted by Pang and Snyder among others: Pang and Lee expanded the basic task of classifying a movie review as either positive or negative to predict star ratings on either a 3- or a 4-star scale, while Snyder performed an in-depth analysis of restaurant reviews, predicting ratings for various aspects of the given restaurant, such as the food and atmosphere (on a five-star scale). First steps to bringing together various approaches‚Äîlearning, lexical, knowledge-based, etc.‚Äîwere taken in the 2004 AAAI Spring Symposium where linguists, computer scientists, and other interested researchers first aligned interests and proposed shared tasks and benchmark data sets for the systematic computational research on affect, appeal, subjectivity, and sentiment in text.Qu, Yan, James Shanahan, and Janyce Wiebe. \\"Exploring attitude and affect in text: Theories and applications.\\" In AAAI Spring Symposium) Technical report SS-04-07. AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CA. 2004. Even though in most statistical classification methods, the neutral class is ignored under the assumption that neutral texts lie near the boundary of the binary classifier, several researchers suggest that, as in every polarity problem, three categories must be identified. Moreover, it can be proven that specific classifiers such as the Max Entropy and SVMs can benefit from the introduction of a neutral class and improve the overall accuracy of the classification. There are in principle two ways for operating with a neutral class. Either, the algorithm proceeds by first identifying the neutral language, filtering it out and then assessing the rest in terms of positive and negative sentiments, or it builds a three-way classification in one step. This second approach often involves estimating a probability distribution over all categories (e.g. naive Bayes classifiers as implemented by the NLTK). Whether and how to use a neutral class depends on the nature of the data: if the data is clearly clustered into neutral, negative and positive language, it makes sense to filter the neutral language out and focus on the polarity between positive and negative sentiments. If, in contrast, the data are mostly neutral with small deviations towards positive and negative affect, this strategy would make it harder to clearly distinguish between the two poles. A different method for determining sentiment is the use of a scaling system whereby words commonly associated with having a negative, neutral, or positive sentiment with them are given an associated number on a ‚àí10 to +10 scale (most negative up to most positive) or simply from 0 to a positive upper limit such as +4. This makes it possible to adjust the sentiment of a given term relative to its environment (usually on the level of the sentence). When a piece of unstructured text is analyzed using natural language processing, each concept in the specified environment is given a score based on the way sentiment words relate to the concept and its associated score. This allows movement to a more sophisticated understanding of sentiment, because it is now possible to adjust the sentiment value of a concept relative to modifications that may surround it. Words, for example, that intensify, relax or negate the sentiment expressed by the concept can affect its score. Alternatively, texts can be given a positive and negative sentiment strength score if the goal is to determine the sentiment in a text rather than the overall polarity and strength of the text. There are various other types of sentiment analysis like- Aspect Based sentiment analysis, Grading sentiment analysis (positive,negative,neutral), Multilingual sentiment analysis and detection of emotions.  Subjectivity/objectivity identification  This task is commonly defined as classifying a given text (usually a sentence) into one of two classes: objective or subjective. This problem can sometimes be more difficult than polarity classification. The subjectivity of words and phrases may depend on their context and an objective document may contain subjective sentences (e.g., a news article quoting people's opinions). Moreover, as mentioned by Su, results are largely dependent on the definition of subjectivity used when annotating texts. However, Pang showed that removing objective sentences from a document before classifying its polarity helped improve performance.  Feature/aspect-based  It refers to determining the opinions or sentiments expressed on different features or aspects of entities, e.g., of a cell phone, a digital camera, or a bank. A feature or aspect is an attribute or component of an entity, e.g., the screen of a cell phone, the service for a restaurant, or the picture quality of a camera. The advantage of feature-based sentiment analysis is the possibility to capture nuances about objects of interest. Different features can generate different sentiment responses, for example a hotel can have a convenient location, but mediocre food. This problem involves several sub- problems, e.g., identifying relevant entities, extracting their features/aspects, and determining whether an opinion expressed on each feature/aspect is positive, negative or neutral. The automatic identification of features can be performed with syntactic methods, with topic modeling, or with deep learning. More detailed discussions about this level of sentiment analysis can be found in Liu's work.  Methods and features Existing approaches to sentiment analysis can be grouped into three main categories: knowledge-based techniques, statistical methods, and hybrid approaches. Knowledge-based techniques classify text by affect categories based on the presence of unambiguous affect words such as happy, sad, afraid, and bored. Some knowledge bases not only list obvious affect words, but also assign arbitrary words a probable \\"affinity\\" to particular emotions. Statistical methods leverage elements from machine learning such as latent semantic analysis, support vector machines, \\"bag of words\\", \\"Pointwise Mutual Information\\" for Semantic Orientation, and deep learning. More sophisticated methods try to detect the holder of a sentiment (i.e., the person who maintains that affective state) and the target (i.e., the entity about which the affect is felt). To mine the opinion in context and get the feature about which the speaker has opined, the grammatical relationships of words are used. Grammatical dependency relations are obtained by deep parsing of the text. Hybrid approaches leverage both machine learning and elements from knowledge representation such as ontologies and semantic networks in order to detect semantics that are expressed in a subtle manner, e.g., through the analysis of concepts that do not explicitly convey relevant information, but which are implicitly linked to other concepts that do so. Open source software tools as well as range of free and paid sentiment analysis tools deploy machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing techniques to automate sentiment analysis on large collections of texts, including web pages, online news, internet discussion groups, online reviews, web blogs, and social media. Knowledge-based systems, on the other hand, make use of publicly available resources, to extract the semantic and affective information associated with natural language concepts. The system can help perform affective commonsense reasoning. Sentiment analysis can also be performed on visual content, i.e., images and videos (see Multimodal sentiment analysis). One of the first approaches in this direction is SentiBank utilizing an adjective noun pair representation of visual content. In addition, the vast majority of sentiment classification approaches rely on the bag-of-words model, which disregards context, grammar and even word order. Approaches that analyses the sentiment based on how words compose the meaning of longer phrases have shown better result, but they incur an additional annotation overhead. A human analysis component is required in sentiment analysis, as automated systems are not able to analyze historical tendencies of the individual commenter, or the platform and are often classified incorrectly in their expressed sentiment. Automation impacts approximately 23% of comments that are correctly classified by humans. However, humans often disagree, and it is argued that the inter-human agreement provides an upper bound that automated sentiment classifiers can eventually reach. Sometimes, the structure of sentiments and topics is fairly complex. Also, the problem of sentiment analysis is non-monotonic in respect to sentence extension and stop-word substitution (compare THEY would not let my dog stay in this hotel vs I would not let my dog stay in this hotel). To address this issue a number of rule-based and reasoning-based approaches have been applied to sentiment analysis, including defeasible logic programming. Also, there is a number of tree traversal rules applied to syntactic parse tree to extract the topicality of sentiment in open domain setting.  Evaluation  The accuracy of a sentiment analysis system is, in principle, how well it agrees with human judgments. This is usually measured by variant measures based on precision and recall over the two target categories of negative and positive texts. However, according to research human raters typically only agree about 80% of the time (see Inter-rater reliability). Thus, a program that achieves 70% accuracy in classifying sentiment is doing nearly as well as humans, even though such accuracy may not sound impressive. If a program were \\"right\\" 100% of the time, humans would still disagree with it about 20% of the time, since they disagree that much about any answer. On the other hand, computer systems will make very different errors than human assessors, and thus the figures are not entirely comparable. For instance, a computer system will have trouble with negations, exaggerations, jokes, or sarcasm, which typically are easy to handle for a human reader: some errors a computer system makes will seem overly naive to a human. In general, the utility for practical commercial tasks of sentiment analysis as it is defined in academic research has been called into question, mostly since the simple one-dimensional model of sentiment from negative to positive yields rather little actionable information for a client worrying about the effect of public discourse on e.g. brand or corporate reputation.

To better fit market needs, evaluation of sentiment analysis has moved to more task-based measures, formulated together with representatives from PR agencies and market research professionals. The focus in e.g. the RepLab evaluation data set is less on the content of the text under consideration and more on the effect of the text in question on brand reputation.

Because evaluation of sentiment analysis is becoming more and more task based, each implementation needs a separate training model to get a more accurate representation of sentiment for a given data set.  Web 2.0  The rise of social media such as blogs and social networks has fueled interest in sentiment analysis. With the proliferation of reviews, ratings, recommendations and other forms of online expression, online opinion has turned into a kind of virtual currency for businesses looking to market their products, identify new opportunities and manage their reputations. As businesses look to automate the process of filtering out the noise, understanding the conversations, identifying the relevant content and actioning it appropriately, many are now looking to the field of sentiment analysis.Wright, Alex. \\"Mining the Web for Feelings, Not Facts\\", New York Times, 2009-08-23. Retrieved on 2009-10-01. Further complicating the matter, is the rise of anonymous social media platforms such as 4chan and Reddit. If web 2.0 was all about democratizing publishing, then the next stage of the web may well be based on democratizing data mining of all the content that is getting published.Kirkpatrick, Marshall. \\", ReadWriteWeb, 2009-04-15. Retrieved on 2009-10-01. One step towards this aim is accomplished in research. Several research teams in universities around the world currently focus on understanding the dynamics of sentiment in e-communities through sentiment analysis.CORDIS. \\"Collective emotions in cyberspace (CYBEREMOTIONS)\\", European Commission, 2009-02-03.

Retrieved on 2010-12-13. The problem is that most sentiment analysis algorithms use simple terms to express sentiment about a product or service. However, cultural factors, linguistic nuances, and differing contexts make it extremely difficult to turn a string of written text into a simple pro or con sentiment. The fact that humans often disagree on the sentiment of text illustrates how big a task it is for computers to get this right. The shorter the string of text, the harder it becomes. Even though short text strings might be a problem, sentiment analysis within microblogging has shown that Twitter can be seen as a valid online indicator of political sentiment. Tweets' political sentiment demonstrates close correspondence to parties' and politicians' political positions, indicating that the content of Twitter messages plausibly reflects the offline political landscape.Tumasjan, Andranik; O.Sprenger, Timm; G.Sandner, Philipp; M.Welpe, Isabell (2010). \\"Predicting Elections with Twitter: What 140 Characters Reveal about Political Sentiment\\". \\"Proceedings of the Fourth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media\\" Furthermore, sentiment analysis on Twitter has also been shown to capture the public mood behind human reproduction cycles on a planetary scale, as well as other problems of public-health relevance such as adverse drug reactions.  Application in recommender systems  For a recommender system, sentiment analysis has been proven to be a valuable technique. A recommender system aims to predict the preference for an item of a target user. Mainstream recommender systems work on explicit data set. For example, collaborative filtering works on the rating matrix, and content-based filtering works on the meta-data of the items. In many social networking services or e-commerce websites, users can provide text review, comment or feedback to the items. These user- generated text provide a rich source of user's sentiment opinions about numerous products and items. Potentially, for an item, such text can reveal both the related feature/aspects of the item and the users' sentiments on each feature. The item's feature/aspects described in the text play the same role with the meta-data in content-based filtering, but the former are more valuable for the recommender system. Since these features are broadly mentioned by users in their reviews, they can be seen as the most crucial features that can significantly influence the user's experience on the item, while the meta-data of the item (usually provided by the producers instead of consumers) may ignore features that are concerned by the users. For different items with common features, a user may give different sentiments. Also, a feature of the same item may receive different sentiments from different users. Users' sentiments on the features can be regarded as a multi- dimensional rating score, reflecting their preference on the items. Based on the feature/aspects and the sentiments extracted from the user-generated text, a hybrid recommender system can be constructed.Jakob, Niklas, et al. \\"Beyond the stars: exploiting free-text user reviews to improve the accuracy of movie recommendations.\\" Proceedings of the 1st international CIKM workshop on Topic- sentiment analysis for mass opinion. ACM, 2009. There are two types of motivation to recommend a candidate item to a user. The first motivation is the candidate item have numerous common features with the user's preferred items, while the second motivation is that the candidate item receives a high sentiment on its features. For a preferred item, it is reasonable to believe that items with the same features will have a similar function or utility. So, these items will also likely to be preferred by the user. On the other hand, for a shared feature of two candidate items, other users may give positive sentiment to one of them while giving negative sentiment to another. Clearly, the high evaluated item should be recommended to the user. Based on these two motivations, a combination ranking score of similarity and sentiment rating can be constructed for each candidate item. Except for the difficulty of the sentiment analysis itself, applying sentiment analysis on reviews or feedback also faces the challenge of spam and biased reviews. One direction of work is focused on evaluating the helpfulness of each review. Review or feedback poorly written is hardly helpful for recommender system. Besides, a review can be designed to hinder sales of a target product, thus be harmful to the recommender system even it is well written. Researchers also found that long and short forms of user-generated text should be treated differently. An interesting result shows that short-form reviews are sometimes more helpful than long-form, because it is easier to filter out the noise in a short-form text. For the long-form text, the growing length of the text does not always bring a proportionate increase in the number of features or sentiments in the text. Lamba & Madhusudhan introduce a nascent way to cater the information needs of today‚Äôs library users by repackaging the results from sentiment analysis of social media platforms like Twitter and provide it as a consolidated time-based service in different formats. Further, they propose a new way of conducting marketing in libraries using social media mining and sentiment analysis.

Elements of the Union Army in the United States Army paraded through the streets of the capital to receive accolades from the crowds and reviewing politicians, officials, and prominent citizens, including United States President Andrew Johnson, a month after the assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln. History On May 10, United States President Andrew Johnson had declared that the rebellion and armed resistance was virtually at an end, and had made plans with government authorities for a formal review to honor the troops. One of his side goals was to change the mood of the capital, which was still in mourning following the assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln a month before at Ford's Theater. Three of the leading Federal armies were close enough to participate in the procession. The Army of the Tennessee arrived via train. The Army of Georgia, also under the command of William T. Sherman, had just completed its Carolinas Campaign and had accepted the surrender of the largest remaining Confederate army, that of Joseph E. Johnston. It arrived from North Carolina in mid-May and camped around the capital city in various locations, across the Potomac River from the Army of the Potomac, fresh off its victories over Robert E. Lee in Virginia. It had arrived in Washington on May 12. Officers in the three armies who had not seen each other for some time (in some cases since before the war) communed and renewed acquaintances, while at times, the common infantrymen engaged in verbal sparring (and sometimes fisticuffs) in the town's taverns and bars over which army was superior. Sherman, concerned that his Westerners would not present as polished an image as the eastern army, drilled his forces and insisted that uniforms be cleaned, buttons and brass shined, and that bayonets glistened. At 9:00 a.m. on a bright sunny May 23, a signal gun fired a single shot and Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade, the victor of Gettysburg, led the estimated 80,000 men of Army of the Potomac down the streets of Washington from Capitol Hill down Pennsylvania Avenue past crowds that numbered into the thousands. The infantry marched with 12 men across the road, followed by the divisional and corps artillery, then an array of cavalry regiments that stretched for another seven miles. The mood was one of gaiety and celebration, and the crowds and soldiers frequently engaged in singing patriotic songs as the procession of victorious soldiers snaked its way towards the reviewing stand in front of the White House, where United States President Andrew Johnson, Commanding General Ulysses S. Grant, senior military leaders, the Cabinet, and leading government officials awaited. At the head of his troops, Meade dismounted when he arrived at the reviewing stand and joined the dignitaries to salute his men, who passed for over six hours. On the following day at 10:00 a.m., Sherman led the 65,000 men of the Army of the Tennessee and the Army of Georgia, with an uncharacteristic semblance of military precision, past the admiring celebrities, most of whom had never seen him before. For six hours under bright sunshine, the men who had marched through Georgia and those who had defeated John Bell Hood's army in Tennessee now paraded in front of joyous throngs lining the sidewalks. People peered from windows and rooftops for their first glimpse of this western army. Unlike Meade's army, which had more military precision, Sherman's Georgia force was trailed by a vast crowd of people who had accompanied the army up from Savannah--freed blacks, laborers, adventurers, scavengers, etc. At the very end was a vast herd of cattle and other livestock that had been taken from Carolina farms.Sheets, Georg R., The Grand Review: The Civil War Continues to Shape America, with commentary by Peter Applebome, Governor L. Douglas Wilder, and Dr. Charles Reagan Wilson. Bold Print, Inc., 2000, York PA. Within a week after the celebrations, the two armies were disbanded and many of the volunteer regiments and batteries were sent home to be mustered out of the army. Although there would be further minor guerrilla actions in the south, particularly with respect to armed criminal factions, such as the James-Younger Gang and racial violence in the South (including the rise of the Ku Klux Klan), military conflict on land between the North and the South had ended. The disbandment of the Union armies and the return home of fathers, brothers, and sons signaled to the population at large that they could begin their return to a normal life and that the end had finally come for the American Civil War. Given the fact that the Civil War provided the origins for the Memorial Day celebrations held all over the United States, today, the current National Memorial Day Parade of the American Veterans Center marches thru parts of the historic parade route used during the two days of parades held in 1865.

John leaves him, claims to have quarrelled with him, and enters the earl's service. John woos the daughter for his brother and refuses to speak for himself. The daughter agrees to meet with Will and describes how it should be done. This revives Will, who then matches everything she demanded. Her mother refuses to let the daughter meet with him alone, but he wins a kiss from her. He asks the earl for leave to marry her, and the earl refuses, threatening to beat his daughter. Will says that if he beats her, he will have to fight all his men; John says that if he had to refuse, he might have done so courteously. Will and John were summoned to parliament at Edinburgh. They meet the earl of Mar there. Will declares his blood is high, he being the king's cousin. The king says the earl hates him more for that but gives him an earldom and makes his brothers lords. Will takes ill for his love. John dresses as a beggar to get to the lady, but is the stoutest beggar that people have seen. He throws down many beggars on his way. He reaches the lady and tells her that his brother is ill. She agrees to meet Will again and they marry at once. Twelve months later, she has a son. They send word to her father, who demands that he marry her. John says that they will give her back, and the earl agrees that Will shall be the Earl of Mar after him, if he will marry her.

It runs east-west in east central Wisconsin from near Manitowoc to Two Rivers. The nearly road passes through mainly rural areas and intersects multiple County Highways along the way. The route came about in 1984 when US 10 was rerouted southbound with I-43 and County Highway D fell into state control. It's also one of two State Trunk Highways connecting I-43 with WIS 42, the other being WIS 147.  Route description  Highway 310 Highway 310 starts at exit 154 of Interstate 43 and US Highway 10. Highway 310 is a 4 lane highway for the first of its route. It then continues as a 2 lane, rural highway. The road then intersects County Highway R, which leads north to Rockwood. Highway 310 then goes eastbound and crosses over the Little Manitowoc River. At 2.6 miles (4.18 km) Highway 310 intersects County Highway Q in a relatively remote area. Continuing eastbound the route continues through an area of marshland, and passes a large cemetery. County Highway B is the next major road that Highway 310 intersects. After this intersection the route progresses through more rural farmland with patches of forest in between. After passing County Highway DD the road continues into a residential area in Two Rivers. Wisconsin Highway 310 becomes a southbound residential street while in Two Rivers known as Hawthorne Avenue, and then turns back eastbound where it meets its terminus at Wisconsin Highway 42. History In 1984 US Highway 10 was rerouted to run smoothly with Interstate 43, the former US 10 was designated State Highway 310. The remaining 7 miles of the road were part of County Highway D until the county government transferred the road to state control, and hence it became part of Highway 310.

It covers an area of . The park's most notable features are its golden, ochre, and orange-hued, deeply eroded sandstone cliffs and outcrops, especially the Brandwag rock. Another feature of the area is the numerous caves and shelters displaying San rock paintings. Wildlife featured at the park includes mongooses, eland, zebras, and over 100 bird species. It is the Free State's only national park, and is more famous for the beauty of its landscape than for its wildlife. Numerous paleontology finds have been made in the park, including dinosaur eggs and skeletons. Geography and climate Golden Gate Hotel in the Golden Gate Highlands National Park \\"Golden Gate\\" refers to the sandstone cliffs found on either side of the valley at the Golden Gate dam. In 1875, a farmer called J.N.R. van Reenen and his wife stopped here as they travelled to their new farm in Vuurland. He named the location \\"Golden Gate\\" when he saw the last rays of the setting sun fall on the cliffs. In 1963, were proclaimed as a national park, specifically to preserve the scenic beauty of the area. In 1981, the park was enlarged to , and in 1988, it was enlarged to . In 2004, the park was announced to be joining with the neighbouring QwaQwa National Park. The amalgamation of QwaQwa National Park was completed in 2007, increasing the park's area to . The park is from Johannesburg and is close to the villages of Clarens and Kestell, in the upper regions of the Little Caledon River. The park is situated in the Rooiberge of the eastern Free State, in the foothills of the Maluti Mountains. The Caledon River forms the southern boundary of the park, as well as the border between the Free State and Lesotho. The highest peak in the park (and also in the Free State) is Ribbokkop at above sea level. The park is located in the eastern highveld region of South Africa, and experiences a dry, sunny climate from June to August. It has showers, hail, and thunderstorms between October and April. It has thick snowfalls in the winter. The park has a relatively high rainfall of per year. Vegetation The park is an area of rich highveld and montane grassland flora. It has more than 60 grass species and a large variety of bulbs and herbs. Each of these species has its own flowering time, meaning that veld flowers can be seen throughout the summer. The park also has Afromontane forests and high-altitude Austro-Afro alpine grassland, which is scarce in South Africa. The ouhout (Leucosidea sericea), an evergreen species, is the most common tree in the park. Ouhout is a favourite habitat of beetles and 117 species occur on these trees in the park. The Lombardi poplars and weeping willows in the park are introduced species, but are kept because of their cultural and historic connection with the eastern Free State. Other exotic species in the park, for example wattle and bluegum, are systematically eradicated. Wildlife Instead of reintroducing one of the \\"big five\\" into the park, the sungazer lizard and water mongoose were reintroduced. Twelve species of mice, 10 species of carnivores, and 10 antelope species have been recorded in the park.List of Mammals present in Golden Gate The grey rhebuck and the mountain reedbuck were present when the park was established.

The sandstone formations in the park form the upper part of the Karoo Supergroup. These formations were deposited during a period of aeolian deposition towards the end of the Triassic Period. At the time of deposition, the climate of the area the park covers was becoming progressively drier until arid desert conditions set in, resulting in a land of dunes and sandy desert, with occasional scattered oases. The deposition of the sandstones ended when lava flowed out over the desert 190 million years ago. The following sequence of geological formations is visible in the park (starting from the bottom): the Molteno Formation, Elliott Formation, Clarens Formation, and Drakensberg Formation. The yellow- brown Golden Gate and Brandwag cliffs are made up of the Clarens formation. The layers in this formation are thick. The Drakensberg formation comprises the basaltic lava that flowed over the desert. It forms the mountain summits in the park. On Ribbokkop, it is thick. The Elliot Formation is a red mudstone where many dinosaur fossils have been found. The oldest dinosaur embryos ever discovered were found in the park in 1978. The eggs were from the Triassic Period (220 to 195 million years ago) and had fossilised foetal skeletons of Massospondylus, a prosauropod dinosaur. More examples of these eggs have since been found in the park. Other fossils found in the park include those of advanced cynodontia (canine toothed animals), small thecodontia (animals with teeth set firmly in the jaw), and bird-like and crocodile-like dinosaurs.  Accommodation  Accommodation in the park is available at Glen Reenen and Brandwag Rest camps. Caravan and camp sites with all amenities are available at Glen Reenen camp. The hotel was formerly part of Brandwag camp, but since its recent refurbishment, it is managed separately by SANParks as Golden Gate Hotel. The nearest town to Golden Gate Highlands National Park is Clarens (17 km to the west), but Phuthaditjhaba is also easily reached by a good tar road, driving through the access gate to the east of the park.

It is located 125 kilometres east of Mount Kenya. The park was initially gazetted as a nature reserve in 1973. It was gazetted as a national park in 1989, following the murder of George Adamson by poachers. Meru National Park and the Tana River mark 65 kilometres of the park's northern boundary. Features of the Tana River include Adamson's Falls, Grand Falls and the Kora rapids. Its eastern boundary is marked by the Mwitamvisi River. The park has several seasonal rivers. The topography of the park slopes gently from an altitude of 490 m in the south-west to an altitude of about 270m in the north-east. The central area of the park is an undulating peneplain. Basement ridges protrude above the surface of the peneplain as rocky inselbergs, domed hills or hard rocks that rise steeply from the surrounding area. The highest of these inselbergs are Mansumbi (488m), Kumbulanwa (450m) and Kora Rock (442m). The cracks and crevices in the inselbergs have become filled with soil, and a wide variety of herbs, shrubs and small wind-blown trees have become established in them. There is a wide variety of animal species in the park, including the caracal, Tanzanian cheetah, African bush elephant, genet, hippopotamus, spotted and striped hyenas, African leopard, lion, serval, wildcat and several types of antelope. The vegetation in the park is mostly acacia bushland. There are also riverine forests of doum palm and Tana River poplar. The park had serious problems with poachers in the 1980s and 1990s. George Adamson and two of his assistants were murdered by poachers in the park in 1989. Adamson is buried in the park with three lions he released. Efforts to restart the park were culminating in 2012 when the British actor Martin Clunes filmed a four month old orphaned lion cub being introduced to the compound; the first in 22 years. The cub named Mugie was around a year old when hyenas attacked it (who were in the area in large numbers due to poachers leaving carcasses behind), inflicting internal injuries from which it did not recover. The program left Tony Fitzjohn and his small crew there hoping to raise funds for the government approved fencing to make the area secure, and still trying to attain three other cubs from nearby Tanzania.http://allafrica.com/stories/201304171438.html  References   External links  * Kenya Wildlife Service ‚Äì Kora National Park Photos of George Adamsons Kampi Ya Simba in the Kora Reserve.

It is based on Jon Michelet's 1977 novel by the same name. The film follows three Svalbard-based shabby seamen, played by Helge Jordal, Sverre Anker Ousdal and Hans Ola S√∏rlie, who discover a Soviet bearing station. They are subsequently targets of Soviet liquidation and American interrogation in an attempt to quiet them and retain the political status quo. The Cold War topics were a critique of the Norwegian policy of allowing a Soviet presence on Svalbard. The film was produced by Dag Alveberg and Petter Borgli, and the script was written by Briton Richard Harris. Two versions of the film were recorded, a Norwegian cinematic film and an English-language television film. First Solum shot the Norwegian-language scenes, and then Cole shot the same scene with the actors speaking English. The entire crew and cast lived on board a ship which traveled through Svalbard and Finnmark during production. The theme music, Svalbardtema, was composed by Geir B√∏hren and Bent √Öserud and has become an anthem for Svalbard. Plot Sverre Anker Ousdal, Helge Jordal and Hans Ola S√∏rlie with Sandy Hook in the background The story centers around three seamen who conduct shady business on board their vessel, Sandy Hook. The film starts with two of them, Tom Jansen (Helge Jordal) and Sverre (Hans Ola S√∏rlie), taking tourists on a polar bear safari. During this trip and at a later scene at a pub in Longyearbyen, where Tom's girlfriend, Eva Jelseth (Kjersti Holmen) is introduced, the viewers are briefed on the politics of Svalbard and the large Soviet presence. The third seaman, Lars (Sverre Anker Ousdal), presents plans to freight a bulldozer to the mainland from Sarstangen. They have been instructed to dump the bulldozer underway as part of an insurance fraud scheme, but have instead made arrangements to sell the vehicle on Greenland. While at port, Tom is called to visit Governor Bache (Jon Eikemo), who warns that he will be keeping an eye on them. After a dramatic but successful delivery of the bulldozer to the purchasers, they return towards Longyearbyen. They report to Isfjord Radio to say they were caught in a storm, but deviate on their route back to avoid returning too early. They get caught in actual bad weather and decide to pull up in a nearby island, Kjerulf√∏ya, north of Nordaustlandet. The following day they go ashore to find food but instead find a cable. They follow the cable until they find a Soviet bearing station. While at the station, they are discovered by the Russians. They return fire after being shot at, killing a Russian; Sverre is wounded. They escape and decide to mix with the fishing fleet to avoid being spotted. However, they are intercepted by a seemingly civilian Russian Aeroflot helicopter, which turns out to be heavily armed and fires at the ship. Sandy Hook steers into a narrow bay, and the protagonists fire back, eventually destroying the helicopter with a firebomb. They continue to Kapp Dufferin, where they anchor. Tom rows to land to find supplies, but while he is on land, a Soviet helicopter bombs Sandy Hook, killing Lars and Sverre. Tom has to walk across Spitsbergen to reach Longyearbyen. After a long march through the wilderness, he reaches a closed mine and rides an aerial tramway for coal to Longyearbyen. Tom wakes in hospital in the company of Bache. Tom's story of the ship's sinking is not believed, and he is sent to Oslo for interrogations by a United States colonel (Jon Ausland) and other American military personnel. In a scene at Holmenkollen Park Hotel, the Soviet ambassador and Norwegian minister discuss the consequences of public knowledge of the incident. Tom is offered a new identity and a job on board a foreign trade vessel. On his way to the port, he escapes from the military police by mixing with a carnival parade. Two endings of the film were made. The second one had a longer chase scene involving a rendezvous with Eva, but in both endings, Tom is killed. Whether this is done by Soviet or American intelligence is left as an open question. Production Jon Michelet in 2011 Jon Michelet's novel Orion's Belt was published by Oktober Forlag in 1977. The book's popularity in part arose from public interest in why 3,000 Russians were living on the Norwegian archipelago. The title refers to the idea that Svalbard was as central in a potential Cold War war theater as Orion's Belt, a central asterism in the constellation Orion. The novel also played on the fear of nuclear war and the lack of information from Norwegian media about the issue.Skagen: 17 The novel received mixed reviews.Skagen: 9 It was translated into English by Ellen Nations.Skagen: 10 The initiative to dramatize the novel was taken by two prop masters, Dag Alveberg and Petter Borgli. They both invested half a million Norwegian krone (NOK) in the project, financed by mortgaging their homes.Skagen: 35 Neither had any experience as producers. Alveberg stated that his main motivation was him being tired of all Norwegian films being social realism. He stated that \\"the story could have taken place, and maybe it has taken place. We all know that the Russians do what they want on Svalbard.\\" Alveberg first attempted to write the screenplay himself but was not satisfied. He presented the screenplay for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation; although they liked the project, they did not feel it was in the scope of the public broadcaster. Norway did not at the time have screenwriters of international standards, and Alveberg decided not to use his film as a training ground. He therefore hired the experienced British screenwriter Richard Harris. Harris had a single meeting with Michelet in Oslo. At first Harris did not believe that there was a significant Norwegian left-wing grouping, nor did he realize that the Russian presence and the conflict in Svalbard was real. Michelet initially wanted Harris to include details such as Jansen's father being a war sailor and that he came from a working-class family, but Harris, with Michelet's understanding, dropped much of the personal backdrop to shorten the storyline. However, the screenplay is loyal to the novel's political stance. Harris never visited Svalbard, although he traveled to Finnmark.Skagen: 24 Solum was selected as director based on the producers' experience with him from Carl Gustav, gjengen og parkeringsbandittene. The producers took more artistic decisions than was common at the time; for instance, they felt that Solum's choice of composer was wrong.Skagen: 28 During this discussion, the team was contacted by Geir B√∏hren and Bent √Öserud, who had read about the plans the newspaper, and sent a music sample to the team. Thus the duo became the first choice of both the director and the producers.Skagen: 29 Tristan DeVere Cole acted as an assistant director in addition to directing the English scenes. The production was organized as a polar expedition. The ferry MS Sognefjord was bought, rebuilt with living quarters and a cutting-roomSkagen: 20 and renamed Orion. After production, the vessel was sold. The reason for using Orion was that there was only one hotel on the archipelago and no place for a film crew. Although this decision required supplies for three months to be brought along, it allowed the team to film at various remote locations on the islands and allowed travel while the film crew were sleeping. Up to 60 people lived on board.Skagen: 30 The vessel SS Listein was bought and used as the protagonist's ship, Sandy Hook. Filming was undertaken both along the Finnmark coast and in Svalbard. The planning concluded one and a half years before production began. The film was made in two versions: a cinematic version in Norwegian and a television version in English. First Solum would direct a scene in Norwegian, and it would be shot. After he was satisfied, Cole would take over and shoot the same scene with the same actors, but with English dialog. The actors' accents were good enough that it did not need to be dubbed, while sufficiently noticeable to make the film exotic and authentic. A documentary about the production was shot concurrently. Sandy Hook was blown up and sunk during one scene. of dynamite were placed on board, and the explosion and sinking were filmed with six cameras. Just after the fuse was lit and the crew were abandoning the ship, it was discovered that the Coastal Steamer was going to pass. To not wreck the scene, Borgli ran below deck and cut the fuse.Skagen: 33 The scene in which Sandy Hook is attacked by the helicopter while in a narrow bay was filmed at Kj√∏llefjord, Finnmark. The helicopter used was Norwegian, but painted in Russian Aeroflot livery. The helicopter was only available that day, but the captain on the vessel was drunk and refused to run it into the bay to film the scenes.Skagen: 37 Only a single Russian is shown with his face in the film, with the rest of the antagonists being faceless Soviets, particularly the helicopter.Skagen: 18 The original ending was created as a compromise resulting in a closing deadline and lack of funding, yet keeping the ending open. After the premiere, a new ending was filmed, which weaved the storyline better together. The second version also trimmed 10 minutes from the film's beginning. Financing SS Haus in 1952, later SS Listein, which was used as Sandy Hook during the film In the early 1980s, Minister of Culture Lars Roar Langslet increased subsidies for Norwegian film. In addition to increased focus on quality and costs, the system encouraged films to be organized as a kommandittselskap (KS)‚Äîa model from the shipping and petroleum industry where each ship was owned by its own KS and had a mix of limited and unlimited liability. This resulted in an increase of private capital to invest in films.Skagen: 15 While the 1970s had been dominated by dramatizations of classical novels and popular plays, the 1980s saw inspiration from Hollywood.Skagen: 16 Work on financing the film started in 1982. Alveberg and Borgli established the production company Filmeffekt and hired Scanbroker to secure financing through KS Orion Film. The business magazine √òkonomisk Rapport warned against investing in the film, characterizing it as an unrealistic \\"castle in the sky\\".Skagen: 21 In December 1983, the Embassy of the Soviet Union lodged an official complaint against the filming of Orion's Belt, accusing it of being a cover for military activity. The complaint was plainly rejected by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The film received problems when applying for state grants from Statens Filmproduksjonsutvalg. Though the screenplay was regarded as exceptionally good by independent consultants, it was given as the reason for the initial rejection. Minor modifications were made, after which the board argued that the Norwegian film industry was too small for such a project and that an action film, with a potential for international viewership, was beyond the mandate of the board. Part of the film industry wanted the board to give Orion's Belt and another film equal recommendations to force the government to make a film-political decision, but the board twice ranked Orion's Belt second. In mid-1983, the film was awarded grants of NOK 6.4 million of a budgeted cost of 10.5 million. Private financing of the KS was completed in 1984.Skagen: 19 By then the cost estimates had escalated to NOK 15 million, largely because of the delays. Orion's Belt was the first film to be financed as a KS, with some investors investing capital and others only guaranteeing. The state grants were structured in such a way that had the film been withdrawn from the cinemas after a revenue of NOK 5 million, all investors would have received more money at the expense of the state. This was in part because increased grants reduced the tax advantage of the KS model. Subsequently, the rules were changed to increase the incentive to make a high- grossing production. The tax rules also caused problems for Alveberg and Borgli in financing their next film, Etter Rubicon. Reception Aftenposten criticized the narrative for placing the climax in the middle. The newspaper characterized the actors as playing amateur theater, but praised the action scenes and cinematography. In contrast, Verdens Gang praised the film, characterizing the three main actors as meeting international standards and maintaining the spirit of Michelet. It gave the film a five of six ranking. Nordlys commented on the realism of the film's topic. It criticized the special effects, which it stated there were less of than in foreign films, and the long time before the story was understood. Yet it praised the suspense which was maintained throughout the film and felt Holmen gave the best acting performance. Adresseavisen stated that the film was \\"too good to be Norwegian\\". It praised the film for its exciting story, for illustrating how Norway was part of the Cold War and how unimportant a single human is in superpower politics. It commented that Michelet was a political author, which allowed him to problematize political issues which were not acceptable for public debate. It also agreed with Harris' choice to remove all flashbacks. Dagbladet commented that the film downplayed the left-wing political aspect of the book and instead focused on the storyline and action. It commented that with increased funding for special effects, Solum was able to achieve his true potential as an action director. It praised Paalsgard for the cinematography and the natural integration of nature footage and backdrops. Following the presentation of the shortened and new ending version, Dagbladet stated that \\"they could just as well have kept the old one\\". Klassekampen praised the film for its action and accepted that it had reduced the amount of intrigue in the novel. The character of Jansen was applauded, as it showed how small an individual is against the superpowers. As the only newspaper, Klassekampen praised the film music. Variety stated that the film was \\"a superbly mounted, convincingly told adventure thriller. Action scenes, such as the helicopter attack, are excitingly staged, and the suspense never lets up. As the rugged Tom, Helge Jordal is very good.\\" However, the magazine criticized the title. The film took a hat-trick at the inaugural Amanda Award, Norway's premier film awards. It won for best feature film, Jordal won for best male actor, and B√∏hren and √Öserud won for best film music. Orion's Belt was nominated for best film at the International Mystery Film Festival of Cattolica, and Ola Solum won the award for best direction. The composers were awarded the 1986 Film Critics' Prize for the music. In 2007, Dagbladet ranked Orion's Belt as Norway's tenth-most important film. In May 2012, Tomas Backstr√∂m announced plans for a remake of the film. He stated that he had secured half the necessary NOK 40 million in financing and that he hoped for state grants for the rest. Actors planned for the remake include Aksel Hennie, Nicolai Cleve Broch, Ola Rapace and Tuva Novotny. Distribution The cinema version was distributed by Kommunenes Filmcentral in Norway and New World Pictures internationally. The film received a 16-year rating in Norway and Finland, and a 15-year rating in Sweden. In the United Kingdom and the United States it was rated Parental Guidance.Skagen: 196 Orion's Belt premiered on 8 February 1985 at eight cinemas in seven Norwegian cities. In Norway, 700,000 people saw the film at the cinema; it grossed NOK 14,172,994 in Norway and slightly less than NOK 3 million abroad.Skagen: 36 A third version of the film was made later, aimed at the American cinema market. It was a dubbed version of the Norwegian recording, but had a slightly different ending. The first DVD version was produced in 2004. The issue was criticized for not removing film grain and for cropping the image to 4:3 instead of 16:9. It further did not feature improvements to the sound and was available only in stereo. Subtitles were absent, despite the fact that some lines of the Norwegian-language version were in English. It did not include bonus material, the English-language version or the alternative ending. On 21 September 2005, Norsk Film published a new DVD version. The film was cleaned up and shown in widescreen, with the audio being digitally remastered and presented in Dolby 5.1 and DTS. Bonus material included in the release included the full English-language version, a 40-minute documentary on the production, two commentary tracks and new interviews with the main contributors. Music The music for the film was composed by Geir B√∏hren and Bent √Öserud. They traveled to Svalbard to gather inspiration and found that the lack of vegetation distorted one's sense of direction. Inspiration was gathered more from the associations of the nature and culture in Svalbard, rather than that of a traditional action film. This included such elements as listening to whale and Inuit song.Skagen: 31 For the storm scenes, the team made a Richard Wagner-inspired piece, which was distinct from the Inuit-inspired music. At the end of the piece was a flute melody, which was then adapted to become the theme song, Svalbardtema.Skagen: 32 Although the music was not mentioned in the original reception, it later became very popular and has become a de facto anthem for the archipelago. B√∏hren and √Öserud established themselves as film music composers with Orion's Belt and composed the music for nearly all of Solum's later films.Skagen: 34 References ;Bibliography * 1985 films 1980s action thriller films 1985 independent films Norwegian action thriller films Norwegian films Norwegian independent films Norwegian-language films English-language films Cold War films Films about murder Films based on Norwegian novels Films based on thriller novels Films set in the Arctic Films set in Norway Films set on islands Films shot in Norway 1980s political thriller films Seafaring films Svalbard in fiction Films directed by Ola Solum 1980s multilingual films Norwegian multilingual films ","title":"Orion's Belt (film)"},{"id":"6435448","text":"Carlos Alberto Rossi (born December 6, 1949) is a member of the provincial 'Neighbourly Union' (Uni√≥n Vecinal) and was elected as part of the Alliance New Front, an electoral alliance with the New Party.

Situated along the Rejang River, Bintangor was an express boat services hub connecting between, Sarikei and Sibu town in the 1970s up to the early 1990s. As road connections between these towns became a more prominent mode of transport, the waterway of the town died down. The town is widely known for its gastronomy, including the \\"Limau Bintangor\\" or Bintangor lime, \\"Bintangor Kampua\\" and Rojak Bintangor, a dish of fruit and vegetable dish mixed together by special sauce dressing. The nearest city from the town is Sibu, 45 minutes drive via the Pan Borneo Highway. Etymology Lime as the symbol of Bintangor. Meradong District was initially named as Binatang district and the town as Binatang town. In Malay language, Binatang literally translated as \\"animal\\". It was said that this area was once a fertile land with various wild fruits; attracting animals to gather here and search for food. Therefore, the early settlers named it Binatang. However, the local people later felt that the name was indecent and it was changed to Bintang (meaning \\"stars\\" in Malay). After a few years, the local authorities decided that the place name should not be changed so easily; and they reverted the name back to Binatang.Yii, 2010. Page 228 Finally, in 1984, after a discussion with district council members, Sarawak chief minister Abdul Taib Mahmud decided to change \\"Binatang\\" district into \\"Meradong\\" district and the town name to \\"Bintangor\\".Yii, 2010. Page 228 The name Meradong is derived from the river of the same name, which passes through the town before merging into the larger Rajang River. The name Bintangor is derived from the name of a tree which is found on the hills. The Calanolide A compound extracted from the Bintangor tree (Calophyllum lanigerum) is believed to be a vital component to treat HIV infection. History In 1853, James Brooke was able to take over Rajang River and its surrounding settlements from the Brunei Sultanate. Before the 1900s, the population in Bintangor was spase. In 1896, the Malays from Second Division (now Betong Division and Sri Aman Division) migrated here and established a settlement with villages of a dozen of houses near the riverside. The remaining areas were covered by forests at this point.Yii, 2010. Page 230 The Malays later moved away but was then requested by Rajah Brooke stay in the southern part of Bintangor so as to protect the early Chinese settlers against other natives in the region. People from Zhangzhou and Xiamen were the first Chinese settlers in Bintangor. There was a documentation whereby a Chinese named Huang Zhi Yun (ÈªÑÂøó‰∫ë) bought a land in Bintangor in 1908. In 1910, Ling Ming LokÔºàÊûóÊòé‰πêÔºâ started planting vegetables in Bintangor. He found that the area was suitable for large-scale cultivation due to sparse population and large tracts of land. Therefore, Ming Lok together with Tiong Kung Ping and Rev Yao Siew King with the encouragement from Rev James Hoover, decided to open up Bintangor for agriculture. In 1917, Ming Lok invited the Chinese from the nearby settlement of Sibu to come to Bintangor.Yii, 2010. Page 239 They applied more lands from the Sibu Resident and his requests were granted.Yii, 2010. Page 229 As a result, large tracts of agricultural lands were opened for 300 Foochow families.

Page 229 At first, there was only a few tailor shops, barber shops, and coffeeshops. The Chinese expanded their businesses to forestry, rice mill, and ice production. By 1937, the number of wooden shophouses in Bintangor increased to more than a dozen, however, were razed to ground by fire in the same year. The wooden shophouses were later moved to a new location. By 1948, there were 24 shophouses. These increased to 47 in 2010.Yii, 2010.

It connects at both ends to its parent highway, I-41/US 41\\\\. It runs east‚Äìwest and north‚Äìsouth in east central Wisconsin from near Neenah around Appleton to near Little Chute through Winnebago, Outagamie and Calumet counties. The Roland Kampo Memorial Bridge spans Little Lake Butte des Morts near the highway's southwest terminus. History WIS 441 at Newberry Street, Appleton The Roland Kampo Memorial Bridge was the first portion of this road completed; traffic began flowing on the bridge at 11 a.m. on November 30, 1975. The bridge, designated County Trunk Highway Q (CTH-Q) for its first years, extended from US 41 to CTH-P (Racine Road), approximately . The bridge was also the last portion of the Tri-County Expressway completed for more than a decade, with the remainder of the expressway mired in the proposal stage. The exits were unsigned until 2019, when they were numbered to 441's mileage. The bridge was given a state highway designation (WIS 441) in the 1980s, with signs to this effect going up in 1985 or 1986. Movement to complete the full of freeway began in the late 1980s, and the first new stretch of freeway since 1975 was completed in November 1991, extending from CTH-P to US 10 (Oneida Street). The entire freeway length was completed in September 1993. Future Between 2012 and 2019, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) is working on expanding the route from east of I-41 to west of Calumet Street from four to six lanes along with upgrades of interchanges along the section. A large part of the work is completing the road's interchange with I-41 by installing missing ramps, adding auxiliary lanes to I-41 and upgrading the Kampo Memorial Bridge. Property was also acquired to allow the smoothing of two sharp curves from the Kampo Bridge to north of Midway Road, which allowed the speed limit for the entire length of WIS 441 to increase from .

The inlay depicts an almost complete Morley consort, including inlay depictions of sheet music, a violin with frets, sets of recorders and wind instruments. The table is oak, with walnut and other woods used for the inlays. It is 90 cm high, 302 cm long and 129 cm wide. National Trust page on the table Like much of the furniture at Hardwick, it is recorded in an inventory of the house made in 1601.Collins, 275 The table is discussed by John Playford. The frets may have been used so as to play dance music with an entirely open string sound rather than for accuracy. In addition there are depicted playing cards from the Tudor Period and other means of amusement such as backgammon, and floral decoration. All the objects seem to be close to actual size; it seems very credible that the lute and the violin are actual size. There is one other inlaid Tudor table of this quality in existence, in the Burrell Collection, Glasgow. Eglantine is a white rose, one of the family emblems and the table was probably a commission for a multiple marriage celebration in 1568, since the inlays include the arms of Hardwick, Talbot, and Cavendish. In that year Bess of Hardwick married her fourth husband, George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury and her son Henry Cavendish and her daughter Mary, married two of his children.Collins, 275 Despite this, the National Trust do not venture to date it.National Trust page on the table Notes References * Collins, David, \\"A 16th-century manuscript in wood: The Eglantine table\\", Early Music (1976) 4 (3): 275-280. doi: 10.1093/earlyj/4.3.275 * Stringed instruments on the Eglantine table, E.

It is the eighth entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot Set during the American Civil War, the short begins with a Northern General (James C. Morton) assigning Larry, Moe, and Curly (as Operators 12, 14 and 15, respectively) to sneak behind enemy lines and obtain secrets. Disguising themselves as southern officers and taking the names Lieutenant Duck (Larry), Captain Dodge (Moe) and Major Hyde (Curly), they insinuate themselves into the mansion of southern officer, Colonel Butts (Bud Jamison). During preparations for a dinner party at the mansion, Curly, more interested in the Colonel's daughter, Judith Butts (Phyllis Crane), manages to mistake a quilted potholder for a cake, resulting in a feather- coughing scene. The short concludes with an episode in which Larry and Curly disguise themselves as, respectively, Captain Dodge's father and wife. This leads to a controversial gag in which Major \\"Bloodhound\\" Filbert (Ted Lorch) inquires about Captain Dodge's baby. Moe runs off and brings in a swaddled infant, which is revealed to be black, thus giving away the Stooges' charade. The three of them run for their lives and hide in a \\"log\\" ‚Äî which turns out to be a hidden cannon ‚Äî which is fired by the Confederates. The Union General wonders aloud where the three spies are. At that moment, the trio promptly land on the General from the sky. Cast Credited Production notes Uncivil Warriors was filmed on March 13‚Äì18, 1935. It is the first short in which the Stooges mention \\"Good Time Charlie\\". When the Stooges meet a guard, they often reference Charlie. The guard asks who Charlie is, and a Stooge replies that \\"everybody knows Charlie. He walks like this.\\" The Stooges then demonstrate a silly walk until they get clear of the guard, at which point they take off running. This is a recurring joke in the Stooge shorts. In Uncivil Warriors, they actually meet a soldier named Charlie, who asks the Stooges, \\"Are you all looking for me?\\" The potholder gag would later appear in the Shemp-era short Three Hams on Rye during a live theatrical production. When Moe brings the black baby into the Colonel's office he attempts to explain how the baby got his dark complexion (\\"We had him down the beach all summer...he got quite sunburned!\\"); this is sometimes deleted for U.S. television broadcasts. The introductory music over the titles is a medley of \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" (most popular marching song of the Union Army) and \\"Dixie\\" (which had the same status in the Confederate Army).

A number of films and television productions emerged from the conflict. The first Argentine film about the war was Los chicos de la guerra (The Boys of the War) in 1984. The BBC drama Tumbledown (1988) told the story of a British officer who got paralysed due to a bullet wound. The computer game Harrier Attack (1983) and the naval strategy game Strike Fleet (1987) are two examples of Falklands-related games. A number of fictional works were set during the Falklands War, including in Stephen King's novella The Langoliers (1990), in which the character Nick Hopewell is a Falklands veteran. The war provided a wealth of material for non-fiction writers; in the United Kingdom (UK) an important account became Max Hastings and Simon Jenkins' The Battle for the Falklands. The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges wrote a short poem, called Juan L√≥pez y John Ward (1985), about two fictional soldiers (one from each side), who died in the Falklands, in which he refers to \\"islands that were too famous\\". Another Argentine example is \\"Elegy for the Argentine Dead Boys, in the South Atlantic\\" by Salvador Oria. Music referencing the war includes songs by Captain Sensible, the Argentine punk-rock band Los Violadores' song \\"Comunicado #166\\", and British heavy metal band Iron Maiden's song called \\"Como Estais Amigos\\". Arts, entertainment, and electronic media Films and television Simon Weston, British war veteran. A number of films and television productions emerged from the conflict. Notable examples include: *In the Episode Burns' Heir on The Simpsons, Krusty the Clown accidentally placed a rerun from his show, thinking it would blend in with the year of the show (1994), instead having him explain the Falkland war. *Simon Weston, a Welsh Guardsman who had suffered serious burns during the bombing of Sir Galahad, became a popular figure due to British media coverage. A series of television documentaries followed the progress of rehabilitation and eventual recovery from his injuries, the first being Simon's War (6 April 1983) in BBC One's QED series. *The 1983 British film The Ploughman's Lunch is set in the media and political world at the time of the war, which it compares to the 1956 Suez War. *The first Argentine film about the war was Los chicos de la guerra (The Boys of the War), directed by Bebe Kamin in 1984. *The film version of Whoops Apocalypse (1986) features a conflict very similar to the Falklands War between the United Kingdom and the fictional Caribbean country of Maguadora over the equally fictional Santa Maya. *The BBC drama Tumbledown (31 May 1988) told the story of Robert Lawrence MC, a junior officer in the Scots Guards (Colin Firth) left paralysed down his left side by a gunshot wound to the head inflicted by an Argentine soldier on Mount Tumbledown, during the final push for Stanley, and his adjustment to disabled life after the war. *Harley Cokeliss' horror film Dream Demon (1988) depicts a planned marriage between the main character and a Falklands War veteran. *The 1989 British film Resurrected, directed by Paul Greengrass, had David Thewlis as a British soldier previously presumed dead in the war reappearing alive weeks after the end of the conflict. *In the American/British film For Queen and Country (1989) starring Denzel Washington, Reuben is a St. Lucia-born British ex-para finding it difficult to adjust to civilian life some years after the war. The film deals with the poverty and crime that Reuben encounters back home and how he is ignored by both society and government despite his service. *The BBC film An Ungentlemanly Act (13 June 1992) depicts the events leading up to and during the initial occupation of the Islands by the Argentine Army. Based on true events, the film was produced to mark the 10th anniversary of the conflict and starred actors Ian Richardson as Governor Rex Hunt and Bob Peck as Major Mike Norman. * The Cracker episode \\"Brotherly Love\\" (1995) features a psychologically damaged veteran from the Falklands War, Barney (Ron Donachie), who gets into a brief argument with DS Jimmy Beck (Lorcan Cranitch) and flies into an insane rage, when Beck shows no interest in Barney's exploits in the war. *Although the drama by Ian Curteis that became known simply as The Falklands Play was originally commissioned by the BBC in 1983, it was then temporarily set aside until 1985. The Corporation subsequently gave a number of reasons why it could not be made, including that it would have been broadcast too close to the 1987 General Election. Curteis maintained that the generally sympathetic portrayal of Margaret Thatcher and his refusal to include material that was contrary to both the official record and what his interviews with the major protagonists had revealed, went against a perceived BBC anti-government bias, citing the fact that Tumbledown - which he and others claimed was more \\"anti-establishment\\" - was made and broadcast. Curteis' play was eventually recorded in a truncated form and screened by the digital satellite channel BBC Four in 2002. *The 2005 Argentine film Iluminados por el fuego (literally \\"Lit by Fire\\", released in English speaking countries as Blessed by Fire), directed by Trist√°n Bauer and starring Gast√≥n Pauls, is a docudrama based on the autobiographical novel of the same name by Argentine Falklands veteran Edgardo Esteban, who fought in the conflict as an 18-year-old conscript. It received a San Sebasti√°n Festival special award. The film tells about a veteran's memories, re-awakened after he learns of the suicide of a former soldier comrade. The movie gave a realistic portrait of the extreme weather and psychologically stressful conditions the Argentine soldiers faced in the field, the brutality and indifference to the suffering of the soldiers by their leaders, and the horrors of modern conflict. The movie won several awards, including a Goya. *The 2006 British film This Is England, directed by Shane Meadows, is set in July 1983 in a small town in England and includes documentary footage and extracts from radio broadcasts about the Falklands War. The main character of the film is 12-year-old Shaun, whose father was killed fighting in the war. *The British science fiction series Ashes to Ashes uses the Falklands War as a backdrop during its second series. *BBC motoring show Top Gear visited Argentina in 2014 for filming a Christmas Special. However, the presenters' cars' number plates were seen as references to Falklands War. Presenter Jeremy Clarkson's Porsche 928's original number plate \\"H982 FKL\\" was seen as a direct reference to the conflict. Upon reaching Ushuaia, from where the General Belgrano departed on its final voyage, an angry mob confronted them. The three presenters were forced to abandon their cars, which were pelted with rocks from demonstrators, and catch the last plane to Buenos Aires and flee to Chile. A filming crew of 30, who was left behind, was escorted to the Chilean border by local police overland. *The Falklands War is a significant episode of the 2011 biographical film The Iron Lady, depicting the life and career of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. *In the 2015 TV show Blunt Talk protagonist, Walter Blunt (Played by Patrick Stewart) is a former Royal Marines major and veteran of the Falklands War along with his valet Harry Chandler (Played by Adrian Scarborough), a former Royal Marines lance corporal.

(\\"Yomp\\" and \\"Task Force\\" also entered the lexicon.) * Pierre Boulle's novel La Baleine des Malouines (1983), translated in the UK as The Falklands Whale and in the US as The Whale of the Victoria Cross, is about a blue whale which befriends the British task force. * The comic strip Bloom County featured several story lines taking place during the Falklands War. * Raymond Briggs' picture book The Tin-Pot Foreign General and the Old Iron Woman (1984) is a satire of the Falklands War. * On Foreign Ground (1986) by Eduardo Quiroga, a novel in diary/letter form, tells of the war from the viewpoint of a young Argentine soldier. * In Stephen King's novella The Langoliers (1990), the character Nick Hopewell is a Falklands veteran. * Falklands 2: Argentina's Back and This Time It's Different (1997) by Jim Thorn is a technothriller about a fictional second invasion of the Falkland Islands. * Las Islas (The Islands, 1998; translated 2012), a novel by Carlos Gamerro, is a satire of the war and the Argentine dictatorship, narrated by an Argentine veteran of the war. * The first chapters of Chris Ryan's novel Land of Fire (2002) are set in the Falklands War, while the latter part involves a plot by a new military junta to re-invade the islands. * The novel Ghost Force (2006) by Patrick Robinson depicts the Argentines reinvading the Falklands. * David Mitchell's bildungsroman Black Swan Green (2006) is set in Worcestershire, England, in 1982, and contains many references to the Falklands War. * Daniel E.

Major General Julian Thompson, of the Royal Marines, wrote his own account as commander in his 1985 book No Picnic: 3 Commando Brigade in the South Atlantic. Other titles focused on the Sea Harrier (Sharkey Ward's Sea Harrier over the Falklands), the land battles leading up to the Argentine surrender (Christian Jennings and Adrian Weale's Green Eyed Boys), and the general experience of battle and life in the surrounding area (Ken Lukowiak's A Soldier's Song and Marijuana Time). Vincent Bramley's \\"Forward into Hell\\" offers a less apologetic account of the War. In Argentina, one of the best-known is Commodore Pablo Carballo's Halcones de Malvinas, a collection of personal experiences of fighter pilots and many others and mandatory reading for admission to the FAA's Escuela de Aviaci√≥n Militar. =Poetry= The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, himself partly of British descent and raised bilingually in Spanish and English, wrote a short poem, called Juan L√≥pez y John Ward (1985), about two fictional soldiers (one from each side), who died in the Falklands, in which he refers to \\"islands that were too famous\\". He also said about the war: \\"The Falklands thing was a fight between two bald men over a comb.\\" The quote apparently came from an interview published in Le Monde on 27 June 1982. A large amount of poetry has been written on both sides, regarding the war. An Argentine example is \\"Elegy for the Argentine Dead Boys, in the South Atlantic\\" by Salvador Oria. =Comics= * The comic book Hellblazer, which unlike other comics, takes place in real time and shows present day crisis and contains social commentary about Britain. The Falklands War is one of those themes that were portrayed and mentioned upon in various issues and story arcs.Sifting Through the Ashes: Analyzing Hellblazer, Part 11 * The mini-series \\"Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker,\\" later collected as Volume 10 of The Boys features the central character, Billy Butcher, as an enlisted man in the Falklands War. Butcher frequently refers to the other side as \\"Argeys.\\"The Boys: Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker: Issue 1 Music Music referencing the war includes: * The song \\"El Aguante\\" by Puerto Rican band Calle 13 from their album Multi Viral, which references the war among other events that Latin America and the world have had to \\"deal with\\" or \\"endure\\" (\\"aguante\\" in Spanish). * The song \\"Glad It's All Over\\" by Captain Sensible, is about the Falklands War.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bobUGEliic * The Argentine punk-rock band Los Violadores wrote the song \\"Comunicado #166\\" at their album Y ahora qu√© pasa ¬øeh?. The song is critical of the military Junta, and the role of the United States. Pil Trafa, the lead singer, commented in 2001 that Argentina should not try to annex the islands, but rather improve as a country, so that the Falklanders themselves would emigrate to Argentina. * The Falklands War provided much of the subject matter for Pink Floyd's album The Final Cut (1983), written by Roger Waters. The lyrics are highly critical of perceived British jingoism and of the Thatcher government's actions. A specific lyric (from the song \\"Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert\\") protesting the sinking of ARA General Belgrano reads: \\"...Galtieri took the Union Jack. And Maggie, over lunch one day, took a cruiser with all hands... apparently to make him give it back.\\" * Pop musician Elvis Costello wrote the song \\"Shipbuilding\\" (1983) with Clive Langer in response to the Falklands War. The song was originally written for Robert Wyatt, whose version was released as a single in August 1982, a couple of months after the war had ended: Wyatt's recording was a Top 40 hit on the UK Singles Chart. Written from the point of view of workers in a depressed shipbuilding town, it points out that their jobs only come at the expense of the lives lost in the war. 1984's \\"Peace in Our Time\\" (released under Costello's alias The Imposter) also references the \\"tiny island invaded\\". * Argentine rock musician Charly Garc√≠a recorded the song \\"No Bombardeen Buenos Aires\\" (\\"Do not bomb Buenos Aires\\") during the war and released it in his album Yendo De La Cama Al Living. The song is about the socio-political climate in Argentina during the war. * Much material produced around this time by the anarchist punk band Crass was extremely critical of the war and its aftermath, in particular the album Yes Sir, I Will (1983) and the singles \\"Sheep Farming in the Falklands\\" and \\"How Does it Feel to be the Mother of 1,000 Dead?\\" The latter, intended as a statement directed at Mrs. Thatcher, led to questions in Parliament and a request for prosecution for obscenity from Conservative MP for Enfield North, Timothy Eggar. Crass were also responsible for Thatchergate, a hoax tape, originally attributed to the Soviet KGB, on which the spliced voice of Margaret Thatcher appears to imply that the destroyer HMS Sheffield was deliberately sacrificed in order to escalate the conflict. * The folk rock band The Levellers wrote and produced the song \\"Another Man's Cause\\" featuring the lyrics \\"Your daddy well he died in the Falklands.\\" * Manchester group The Fall released the single \\"Marquis Cha-Cha\\" (1983), which tells the story of a Lord Haw-Haw type figure who broadcasts from Argentina but meets a sticky end. * British heavy metal band Iron Maiden recorded for their album Virtual XI (1998) a song called \\"Como Estais Amigos\\", about the Falklands War. * Macclesfield-based punk band The Macc Lads penned a typically un-PC song called \\"Buenos Aires (1982, Falklands War Mix)\\" which included lyrics such as \\"Costa Mendez lives in fear / Of real men who can hold their beer!\\" and \\"hey hey hey / The lads are on their way / With their bayonets and tommy guns / and their bellies full of Boddingtons.\\" * Scottish anarcho-punk band Oi Polloi's song about one of the victims Simon Weston is also a clear condemnation of the war. * Joe Jackson's song \\"Tango Atlantico\\" (from the 1986 album Big World) represents a look back at the Falklands War. * The title track of The Exploited's album Let's Start a War (1983) directly addresses the Falklands War, implying Margaret Thatcher started it almost on a whim, for her own benefit and to take the focus away from other problems Britain was facing at the time, such as unemployment. * On their album From Here to Eternity: Live (1999), The Clash substitute a line in the song \\"Career Opportunities\\" for \\"I don't wanna die, fighting in the Falkland Strait\\" which was a common ad-lib during their set at the time. * Some people in Britain took the song \\"Six Months in a Leaky Boat\\" by the New Zealand pop group Split Enz to be a criticism of the war, and the song was banned by the BBC. The group denied that this was the song's intent particularly because the song was recorded earlier in 1982. * \\"Fields of Fire\\" by Big Country, is about the Falklands War. * The Dire Straits song \\"Brothers in Arms\\", written by Mark Knopfler, is about the Falklands War. * Billy Bragg's song \\"Island of No Return\\", originally released on his 1984 album Brewing Up with Billy Bragg, was written from the point of view of a young soldier serving in the Falklands. * Super Furry Animals' song \\"The Piccolo Snare\\" from their 2004 album Phantom Power was partly inspired by frontman Gruff Rhys' childhood memories about the Falklands War, as well as contemporary observations of the Iraq War. * Los Angeles punk band NOFX's song \\"Ronnie & Mags\\" off of their 2012 album Self Entitled mentions the Falklands War multiple times, as it focuses on Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher's relations. * Vin Garbutt's song \\"Dark side of the Moon\\" on the 1999 album Word of Mouth * The Sabaton song \\"Back in Control\\" on their 2006 album Attero Dominatus. * Vampire Weekend's song \\"Mansard Roof\\" on their 2008 eponymous album references the conflict in the second verse of the song. Theatre * British playwright Steven Berkoff wrote the highly critical satirical play Sink the Belgrano! (1986) about the British decision to go to war and the sinking of the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano. Visual arts Linda Kitson was the official war artist accompanying British troops during the Falklands Conflict. She created over 400 drawings of the troops' daily life, many of which are now part of the Imperial War Museum‚Äôs art collection and were exhibited to the general public in November 1982. They were featured again in the Museum's exhibition Women War Artists, in 2011-2012. All of Kitson's drawings which were not retained by the Museum were sold. Football Tottenham Hotspur's popular Argentine midfielder Ossie Ardiles had helped beat Leicester City in an FA Cup semi-final one day after the invasion: whilst Ardiles was booed by the Leicester fans, who chanted \\"England, England, England\\" whenever he touched the ball, the Tottenham supporters responded by chanting \\"Argentina, Argentina, Argentina\\" in support of Ardiles. Two days later he left England to return to Argentina: according to him, this had already been arranged before the war so he could prepare with the Argentina national football team ahead of the 1982 FIFA World Cup. Whilst Tottenham's manager Keith Burkinshaw wanted Ardiles to return to the club for the next season, Ardiles felt unable to do this, and as a compromise it was agreed that he would instead go on loan to Paris Saint-Germain. However he would subsequently return to Tottenham, remaining with the club until 1988 and winning the UEFA Cup with them in 1984. His cousin Jos√© Ardiles, a fighter pilot, was killed during the early stages of the air campaign, becoming the first Argentine pilot to die in the war. Ardiles' countryman and Tottenham team-mate, Ricardo Villa, also chose to miss the 1982 FA Cup Final, and subsequently left the club in 1983. White, Blue and White, a documentary on Ardiles and Villa's experiences in England, including the period of the conflict, was produced for ESPN's 30 for 30 series. Elsewhere, Stockport County stopped using their blue-and-white kit inspired by the Argentina national team, stating that playing in it \\"hardly seems appropriate, given the current circumstances\\". The war also created heightened passions between Argentina and England in the 1986, 1998, and 2002 FIFA World Cups, featuring play by Diego Maradona, Peter Shilton, and David Beckham. (See Argentina‚ÄìEngland football rivalry.) State recognition Monument to the Fallen Soldiers, Buenos Aires. Liberation Memorial, Stanley. Holidays The war is commemorated as D√≠a del Veterano de Guerra y los Ca√≠dos en Malvinas (Veterans and Fallen Soldiers of the Falklands Day), a public holiday in Argentina, on 2 April. It is sometimes referred to as Malvinas Day. In Britain, those who lost their lives are remembered as part of Remembrance Sunday. In the Falkland Islands themselves, two holidays commemorate the war: Liberation Day on 14 June (or the first Monday afterward, if it falls on a weekend), a public holiday in the Falkland Islands, and Margaret Thatcher Day on 10 January. Memorials In the United Kingdom, there is a national memorial at Pangbourne College, a small co-educational public school in Berkshire; it is titled the Falkland Islands Memorial Chapel. There are several memorials in the Falkland Islands, the most predominate of which is the 1982 Liberation Memorial in Stanley which was unveiled on 14 June 1984 (the second anniversary of the end of the war and liberation of the Falkland Islanders). When the war started a Buenos Aires street, \\"Calle Inglaterra\\" (England Street), was renamed \\"Calle 2 de Abril\\" (April 2 Street), after the start date of the war. In November 2013, the street briefly reverted to its original name \\"Calle Inglaterra\\".La calle \\"2 de Abril\\" volvi√≥ a llamarse \\"Inglaterra\\" y se desat√≥ la pol√©mica But due to the resulting denunciations and fierce protests caused by this name, the same street was finally renamed in March 2014 as the \\"Pasaje 2 de Abril\\" by the Buenos Aires government, also because another street named \\"Calle 2 de Abril\\" already exists in Buenos Aires.http://www.parlamentario.com/noticia-70606.html La calle ‚ÄúInglaterra‚Äù se llamar√° ‚ÄúPasaje 2 de abril‚Äù In 1982, after the Falklands War ended, the clock tower \\"Torre de los Ingleses\\" (Tower of the English), which was a gift from the local British community to the city of Buenos Aires in commemoration of the centennial of the May Revolution of 1810, was renamed as the \\"Torre Monumental\\" (Monumental Tower). At the same time, the \\"Plaza Brit√°nica\\" (British Square), where the tower is situated, was renamed as the \\"Plaza Fuerza A√©rea Argentina\\" (Argentine Air Force Square). The Monument to the Fallen Soldiers was built in this square. Terminology This war is occasionally written as The Falklands/Malvinas War, recognising the international split over the Islands' name. Other constructs such as Falklands Conflict and Falklands Crisis have also been used. The term Guerra de las Malvinas or Malvinas War is the one normally used in Spanish-speaking countries and has also been used by some socialist groups in English-speaking countries. The name \\"Guerra del Atl√°ntico Sur\\", meaning \\"War of the South Atlantic\\" is also used in Spanish.Veteranos de Guerra del Atl√°ntico Sur Roberto Russell, America Latina Y La Guerra Del Atlantico Sur Unlike the term \\"Falklands/Malvinas War\\", this reflects the fact that some of the conflict occurred in South Georgia (which at the time was a dependency of the Falklands), and the deep ocean.

Background In the field of direct marketing, the subscriber list is considered the most important part of a mailing campaign. Marketers devote a great deal of time and money to collecting a \\"list\\" of highly targeted subscribers as a result. Common methods for gathering a mail list include business reply mail, telemarketing, list rentals, and co-registration agreements. Email lists serve the same purpose in the digital world. A highly targeted list of email subscribers allows the owner to market their product and service with a fairly high probability of success. With the proliferation of spam, however, consumers are very careful about giving out their email addresses. To ease consumer concerns experienced online, businesses create \\"Squeeze Pages\\" that detail the businesses' privacy standards and what the subscriber will receive. Squeeze page strategies A squeeze page is a single web page with the sole purpose of capturing information for follow-up marketing; that means NO exit hyperlinks. Quality squeeze pages use success stories that the prospect would relate to when making a buying decision. They also use things like color psychology, catchy sales copy and keyword rich text placed with SEO (search engine optimization) in mind. Some advanced marketers even use audio and video on their squeeze page. Internet marketers borrow copywriting techniques from offline direct response marketing. This includes the use of a headline, bullets, teaser copy, deadlines, testimonials, scarcity, and the like. Aggressive marketers will present visitors with multiple incentives in exchange for their contact information. As a general rule, Internet marketers try to keep the content on their squeeze pages to a minimum. The goal of the page is to obtain the visitor's email address; additional information could distract the user or cause them to \\"click away\\" to a different website. Navigation and hyperlinks are almost always absent from typical squeeze pages. The absence of links is used to focus visitors' attention on one choice: register for the email list or leave the site. Squeeze pages are often used in conjunction with an email autoresponder to begin delivering information as soon as the visitor confirms their email address. The autoresponder may be utilized to send a series of follow-up emails or to provide an immediate download link to get information. Promising information upon completion of confirming their email address has proven to be an effective method of increasing opt-ins using squeeze pages. New technology has also led to adding voice or video to squeeze pages in an effort to capture the visitor's attention. Search engine optimization In 2011, on two occasions (Google \\"Panda\\" and \\"Farmer\\" in February and June), the major search engines adjusted their algorithms to more accurately rank and sometimes exclude squeeze pages that are considered to be \\"spam\\" due to their lack of content. In addition, some marketers have seen their pay-per-click campaigns being penalized by restrictions that prevent \\"affiliates\\" from purchasing pay-per-click advertising to build opt-in lists for future sales. In response, marketers have begun to increase the amount of content included on Squeeze pages to ensure that their page maintains its search result rankings. Content on a squeeze page can be increased by adding a blog at the bottom of the page. Another squeeze page design that is growing in popularity is a combination of a linear sales page and a squeeze page. This design keeps the squeeze page basics such as opt-in form, bullet points, and video at the top of the page. At the bottom of the page the user would find more content and product information..

Character history  Born the last of five daughters to the Commander of the Royal Guards, General Fran√ßois Augustin Regnier de Jarjayes (a real historical personageda Silva, Val√©ria Fernandes (2007) Mang√° feminino, Revolu√ß√£o Francesa e feminismo: um olhar sobre a Rosa de Versalhes (in Portuguese)), she is raised by her father as if she were a boy in order to succeed him as the commander of the Royal Guard at the Palace of Versailles. Upon the completion of her military training at the age of fourteen, Oscar is tasked with protecting the Dauphine Marie Antoinette when she arrives at Versailles. Despite being raised as if she were a boy and dressing in males' clothes, Oscar is open about being female. Even as she embraces her womanhood, she uses her male position to gain freedoms that she could never have as a lady of the court. She is the love interest of both Andr√© Grandier, her servant at the Jarjayes mansion and afterwards a soldier in her regiment, and Marie Antoinette, who she acts as a bodyguard to. She also earns the admiration and love of Rosalie Lamorli√®re, and in turn calls Rosalie her \\"spring breeze\\". Other women are infatuated with Oscar, even after she tells them she is female.Women-loving Women in Modern Japan, by Erin Subramian She dislikes the court intrigues, but remains there out of loyalty to her father and her friend, Marie Antoinette. At one point, Oscar falls in love with the Swedish aristocrat Hans Axel von Fersen, who has a forbidden love for Marie Antoinette. Soon gaining the Dauphine and Queen-to-be's affection and trust, Oscar experiences life at Versailles and the pain caused by the contradictions of her being a woman whom everybody, including herself, considers a man. Later in the story, Oscar learns of the political ideals of the French Revolution and that the royalist regime is corrupt. As violence erupts in Paris, Oscar renounces her status and her regiment of French Guards joins forces with the people marching to the Bastille. While leading an artillery bombardment of the fortress, Oscar is shot by the royal soldiers inside; she dies right before the Bastille falls.  Development  A portrait of the real Fran√ßois Augustin Reynier de Jarjayes, who Ikeda portrayed as Oscar's father. Modeled after the revolutionary Pierre-Augustin Hulin, Oscar was originally a supporting character to Marie Antoinette and was created as a female because Ikeda was unsure if she could accurately portray a male soldier. However, Oscar eclipsed Marie Antoinette in popularity and due to reader feedback became a very important character only until her death. Eri Izawa suggests that as Oscar is fictional, Ikeda could be freer in the portrayal of Oscar's life than Ikeda could be in the life of Marie-Antoinette, who had to die on the guillotine. Oscar's androgynous persona is based on the actresses who play male roles in the Takarazuka Revue and Princess Sapphire, and she was named for Oscar Wilde, as Ikeda is a fan of his. The way Oscar is drawn has been regarded as a way of showing her androgyny: she is shorter than male characters, but taller than female characters, and her eyebrows are thicker than female characters but thinner than male characters - giving the effect of looking feminine when compared to male characters and masculine when compared to female characters.  Actresses  Oscar portrayed by Catriona MacColl. In the Takarazuka Revue performances of The Rose of Versailles, Oscar has been played by several male- role actresses from 1974 to the present day. In the 1974 Moon Troupe performance, Yuri Haruna played Oscar. Mayo Suzukaze has played Oscar. Kei Aran and Hikaru Asami played Oscar in 2006.The feminine \`kabuki' alternativeTakarazuka Revue In the 1979 anime adaptation of The Rose of Versailles, Oscar was voiced by Reiko Tajima.http://www9.nhk.or.jp/anime/versailles/ In the 1979 film Lady Oscar, Oscar was played when a child by Patsy Kensit, and when adult by Catriona MacColl. MacColl's feminine and weak portrayal of Oscar was criticized, and it was felt that she was not androgynous enough to play Oscar.  Reception  Oscar has been described as \\"iconic\\", as an archetype, \\"thrilling\\", and credited with the success of Rose of Versailles,Japan Sessions as she illustrates the performative nature of gender. Ian Buruma and Deborah Shamoon consider that Oscar's politics are less important to the audience than her romances. Shamoon sees the Oscar-Andre relationship as very different from the Cinderella-Prince Charming stories which \\"dominated\\" sh≈çjo manga in the 1960s, where the female protagonist would lose her identity to her boyfriend. Shamoon considers that the Oscar-Andre relationship follows the pattern of pre-war douseiai sh≈çjo novels, which featured same-sex love between girls. Kazuko Suzuki says that after RoV, \\"several works\\" were created with \\"nonsexual\\" female protagonists like Oscar, who realise their \\"womanness\\" upon falling in love.Suzuki, Kazuko. 1999. \\"Pornography or Therapy? Japanese Girls Creating the Yaoi Phenomenon\\". In Sherrie Inness, ed., Millennium Girls: Today's Girls Around the World. London: Rowman & Littlefield, p.250 , . Suzuki sees her as being a transitional figure between the heterosexual romances of 1960s sh≈çjo manga and those of sh≈çnen-ai.Suzuki, Kazuko. 1999. \\"Pornography or Therapy? Japanese Girls Creating the Yaoi Phenomenon\\". In Sherrie Inness, ed., Millennium Girls: Today's Girls Around the World. London: Rowman & Littlefield, p.249 , . Oscar's \\"gorgeous androgyny\\" has led to her being interpreted as belonging to the bish≈çnen - beautiful young men. Oscar's relationship with Andre has been interpreted as being male-male,Mizoguchi, Akiko (2003) Akogare no Yoroppa (now at Archive.org) as cited in and Andre vows to die for Oscar if he needs to, like the Kabuki samurai. Oscar's conflict between her principles and her loyalty to Marie-Antoinette has also been compared with a \\"samurai who must be faithful to an unworthy master\\". Oscar has appeared in the Animage top 50 character list as recently as 1992. Susan J. Napier described Oscar as a \\"truly complex and three-dimensional figure who offered young Japanese women a different kind of role model\\", citing her influence in Utena Tenjo of Revolutionary Girl Utena. In 2007, a manga series called ' was serialised in Chorus and was compiled into one volume. It told the story of an office lady who is inspired by the character of Oscar to defy her managers. It was adapted into a six episode TV series and renamed Haken no Oscar ~\\"Sh≈çjo Manga\\" ni Ai o Komete, which aired starting from 28 August 2009. In the 1990s and 2000s, Oscar inspired Revolutionary Girl Utena and Le Chevalier D'Eon. Anne Duggan describes Oscar as a \\"maiden warrior\\", a young woman who disguises herself as a man to take up arms and protect king and country, as in The Ballad of Mulan, Madame d'Aulnoy's Belle- Belle ou Le Chevalier Fortun√©, or Marie-Jeanne L'H√©ritier's Marmoisan ou La Fille en gar√ßon. At the close of the tale, the typical maiden warrior hangs up her sword. Duggan describes Oscar as a case where the maiden refuses to put away her sword, and fights against the order that she was supposed to defend. Oscar's masculinity is central to her character, unlike in the earlier maiden warrior tales, and Oscar also helps usher in a permanent change to French society by supporting the French Revolution.  Crossover  Oscar makes a crossover appearance in the Lupin the Third Part II episode \\"Versailles Burned with Love\\", in which Oscar recruits Lupin in helping her steal the crown of Marie Antoinette. The series is mentioned as a frame of reference for the Rose Knights in the light novel series Gate: Jieitai Kano Chi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri.

They are located in the karst valley of the Erkyupriya River in the Western Rhodopes at metres above sea level, at the foot of Persenk Peak. Description The \\"bridges\\" were formed by the erosive activity of the once larger Erkyupryia River. It transformed the marble clefts into a deep-water cave, the ceiling of which eroded through time and collapsed, possibly during an earthquake. Geologists suggest that the water carried the debris away. As a result, the two remaining bridge-shaped outcrops remained. The larger one (upstream) is 15 metres at its widest and 96 metres long, and shaped by three vaulted arches, the largest of which is 45 metres high and 40 metres wide. The river flows under the middle- sized arch. The larger Wonderful Bridge is passable under the vaults, where birds nest in the marble clefts. The smaller bridge is 200 metres downstream. It is impassable to tourists, 60 metres in length, with a total height of 50 metres, 30 metres at the highest point of the arch. A third, small and inaccessible, formation follows, the entrance to a pothole where the river's waters disappear underground, reaching a sump after 3 km. The adjacent area is wooded, with century-old conifers, mainly spruces. Many karst caves are known nearby, but most of them are undeveloped and unsuitable for tourist visits. However, both bridges can be crossed on secure trails. Two tourist huts are located nearby. The site can be reached by an asphalt road and is about 30 km from the closest town, Chepelare.

There is an updated version, the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB-R). It helps discern the presence, degree, and type of aphasia. It also measures how the patient performed on the test to provide a baseline so they can detect changes throughout their time in therapy. This also allows to see the patient's language strengths and weaknesses so that they can figure out what to treat, and lastly, it can infer the location of the lesion that caused aphasia. Another such test is the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination. The WAB targets English speaking adults and teens with a neurological disorder between the ages of 18 and 89 years old. The WAB tests both linguistic and non linguistic skills. The linguistic skills assessed include, speech, fluency, auditory comprehension, reading and writing. The nonlinguistic skills tested include drawing, calculation, block design and apraxia. The aphasia quotient (AQ) is the summary score that indicates overall severity of language impairment. The WAB‚ÄìR, a full battery of 8 subtests (32 short tasks), maintains the structure and overall content and clinical value of the current measure while creating these improvements: * Two new supplementary tasks (reading and writing of irregular and non-words) will aid the clinician in distinguishing between surface, deep (phonological), and visual dyslexia. * Revision of approximately 15 items * Bedside WAB‚ÄìR ‚Äì provides a quick look at patient's functioning * Examiner's manual with technical/psychometric properties information, test interpretation relevant to aphasic populations, historical evidence of reliability and validity, and information about the unique aspects of assessing the language ability of individuals with dementia * Spiral-bound stimulus book replacing loose stimulus cards * Revised administration directions ‚Äì more user-friendly with directions to the examinee for all subtests * Expanded scoring guidelines for clarity * It helps classification of Aphasia into different types. Scoring Criterion cut scores: * Aphasia Quotient * Cortical Quotient * Auditory Comprehension Quotient * Oral Expression Quotient * Reading Quotient * Writing Quotient * Bedside WAB‚ÄìR scores The Western Aphasia Battery (Shewan & Kertesz, 1980) was designed to provide a means of evaluating the major clinical aspects of language function: content, fluency, auditory comprehension, repetition and naming plus reading, writing and calculation. In addition to the nonverbal skills of drawing, block design and praxis are evaluated and Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices test is usually administered as well. The scoring provides two main totals, in addition to the subscale scores. These are the Aphasia Quotient (AQ) score and Cortical Quotient (CQ) score. AQ can essentially be thought of as a measure of language ability, whilst CQ is a more general measure of intellectual ability and includes all the subscales. Administration of the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) yields a total score termed the Aphasia Quotient (AQ), which is said to reflect the severity of the spoken language deficit in aphasia. This score is a weighted composite of performance on 10 separate WAB subtests. Scores rate severity as follows: 0-25 is very severe, 26-50 is severe, 51-75 is moderate, and 76‚Äìabove is mild.Western Aphasia Battery-Revised. (n.d.).

Rebecca has been played by both Maureen McCormick (July 5 to August 17, 2000) and Andrea Evans (September 1, 2000 to August 7, 2008), neither of whom were ever on contract. The character's maiden name has never been revealed, although Tabitha has referred to Rebecca being an Osborn woman. Although now divorced from both Jonathan and Julian, Rebecca uses the surname Hotchkiss Crane. Storylines Early life Rebecca grew up as a shy, conservative young woman bathed in riches, and beauty, and was descended from a wealthy respected family. However, Rebecca's came from a long line of Osborn women who were seemingly very manipulative and cunning. One even arranged for John Wilkes Booth to assassinate Abraham Lincoln just for spiting her. Rebecca favored these ancestors, and was very eye-catching toward the men in her day. During her teens she fell for a local boy in her hometown, but was unable to be with him due to their different social strata's. At age 17, when she was a bridesmaid to her friend Ivy Winthrop's wedding, she slept with the groom's father, Alistair Crane. It was Alistair who introduced Rebecca to \\"satisfy the appetite of men\\". After her family forced her to end a relationship, Rebecca set her sights on Jonathan Hotchkiss. Soon Rebecca stole Jonathan from his fianc√©e Clarissa Morton, and married him. They had only one child together, a daughter named Gwen. Their marriage went sour, as Rebecca soon learned that Jonathan, who was broke, had only married her for her money. Rebecca's eye later wandered, and she committed adultery with tabloid editor JT Cornell. Rebecca was thrilled when Ethan Crane and Gwen met and fell in love, because she always wanted her daughter to be rich and powerful, and happy. When she found out that Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald and Ethan were involved, she immediately warned her daughter. Rebecca recognized the same lies and manipulations from what she herself had done as a younger woman. Rebecca's warnings didn't help, because Ethan postponed the wedding and began seeing both woman, getting disinherited as a result. After Gwen returned her engagement ring, Rebecca was determined to get not only her daughter, but also herself in the Crane house, and get revenge on what she believed to be gold- digger for scheming to break up Gwen and Ethan's relationship in the first place. It's possible Rebecca saw her husband in Theresa, as he had once married her for her considerable fortune. She began an affair with Julian Crane, whom she nicknamed \\"Pookie\\", the plan to eventually get him to ask her to marry him. Then she found the proof of Ethan's paternity on Theresa's laptop, and she and Gwen used Theresa's e-mail to send it to the tabloids. She set up a plan, filed for a divorce from her husband so she could have Julian for herself. She married Julian in a quick wedding ceremony after he signed the annulment papers with Theresa, but when it was discovered that Julian and Theresa had supposedly consummated their marriage, that nullified the documents, so Rebecca had no cent to her name. Although it was eventually discovered that Julian and Theresa's marriage was invalid, there was no mention of the fact that Rebecca's marriage to Julian was therefore valid, and Rebecca had to blackmail Julian to marry her by threatening to expose Eve Russell to her family. Blackmailing Julian wasn't her only plan though. Rebecca decided to turn the tables on Theresa and make Theresa pay for everything she had done to Gwen over the years by taking her son away. She had an even deeper motive; she planned to arrange for Ethan and Gwen to adopt Theresa's son, to replace the child Sarah Winthrop that they had lost. Although Rebecca came to care deeply about her stepson, she firmly believed he was better off without Theresa in his life, and knew that Gwen and Ethan could provide him with both love and stability. After child protective services deemed Theresa an unfit mother and the courts terminated her parental rights, Rebecca used her influence to get Julian to sign away his rights to his son and to convince Judge Reilly to approve Ethan and Gwen's adoption of the boy. When she learned that the baby Theresa was carrying for Ethan and Gwen could be the result of Theresa's rape of Ethan, Rebecca swore to finally get her vengeance on the girl who had caused her daughter so much pain. At the same time, Rebecca, desperate to keep her husband, decided to poison Eve Russell. Rebecca never did get caught for poisoning Eve. When the case went to trial, with Eve accused of poisoning Alistair, Julian and Liz Sanbourne (who had drunk the poison Rebecca had intended for Eve), Rebecca manipulated Julian into signing a document that promised he would never divorced her‚Äîthen took the stand and pointed the finger at Liz. Julian kept his promise to stay married to her, but still have Eve. When Gwen became worried that JT Cornell would tell Theresa the truth about the tabloid article, Rebecca used her past with JT to keep him quiet‚Äîuntil Theresa offered him money. She was hoping that since Eve is getting closer to TC so that Julian would leave Eve and get back together with her. Eve eventually broke off their engagement, however he didn't go back to Rebecca. Julian and Rebecca were recently revealed to be divorced. Although the two are no longer married Julian and Rebecca still have sex. Rebecca is also sleeping with JT. JT eventually was murdered by a blackmailer whose identity is yet to be revealed. Rebecca has sought to \\"avenge\\" JT's memory by finding out all of his secrets. Soon Rebecca and Gwen learned JT's greatest secret: the true paternity of Ethan Crane, Theresa's son. The two plotted to reveal the truth to Ethan, Little Ethan's real father at an opportune moment. After the failed wedding between Paloma and Noah, and Fancy and Luis, Rebecca was knocked unconscious while wearing the blackmailer's signature male/female clothing. She was shocked to learn the real blackmailer had tricked her into wearing his clothing, and even more shocked to find out from Gwen that the Blackmailer's true identity was Vincent Clarkson. Both she and Gwen later tried to prevent Theresa's marriage to Ethan, but failed. They later assisted the newly resurrected Alistair Crane in poisoning Theresa, but their plan backfired leaving Ethan in a coma, Theresa emotionally shattered, and Chad Harris-Crane, Ethan's best friend dead. Juanita Vasquez plot, Downfall and Incarceration, 2007‚Äì2008 Rebecca was shocked to learn Gwen had secretly given birth to a son, Jonathan Winthrop. She was one of the first to notice that her grandson was constantly ill. Rebecca also discovered Pilar Lopez-Fitzgerald's secret history in JT's files, regarding her connection to the Vasquez family massacre. Information which she, and Gwen used to make both Pilar and Theresa do their bidding. Rebecca is relentless to see her daughter with the man she loves, even if it means the death of her grandson. Though the baby pulled through thanks to a liver transplant by Theresa's son Ethan, Rebecca threatened Pilar to keep quiet, and helped her daughter to misinterpret Theresa's selfless actions in Ethan's mind. When a wedge was established between the couple, Rebecca warned Gwen to be cautious of both Theresa and Esme Vanderheusen the best friend of Fancy Crane, and a notorious man user. Rebecca was accidentally stabbed by Esme's niece Viki, an unknowingly unstable serial killer. Though Rebecca survived she accidentally revealed to Ethan minor details about the Vasquez family when she learned Theresa and Pilar had gone to Mexico because of the threats of Juanita Vasquez. When Ethan left for Mexico, and Gwen followed Rebecca urged her daughter by phone to kill Pilar. When Gwen could not go through with it and revealed that Juanita had learned of their blackmailing schemes, Rebecca decided to leave Harmony, but was prevented by Sam Bennett, and Viki. Both Rebecca and Gwen were sent to jail for their various crimes; such as blackmail, fraud, bribery, and murder of not only Pilar's sister and nephews in Mexico, but also attempted murder on everyone in the basement of the church, when they were finally exposed in the series finale, mainly no thanks to Rebecca and her annoying babbling, one of her least attractive traits. During the series finale, Rebecca's babbling revealed that Gwen's marriage to Ethan was invalid due to Gwen already being married from a trip to Las Vegas.

Officers of the Allied air forces were held in special camps called Stalags Luft but were accorded the required preferential treatment. The German Army camp commanders applied the Geneva Convention requirements to suit themselves. An example was as to the amount of food/meat to be provided to each POW. In Oflag XIII-B when a dead horse was brought into the camp, its total weight (including head, bones, etc.) was used in computing the amount each POW was to receive, which resulted in each POW receiving only a few ounces of meat per week.

It is the twenty-third book in a series of novels featuring the adventures of assassin Matt Helm. Plot summary While Mac (Helm's boss) is on a rare solo assignment, elements within Mac's agency try to take power away from him. It's up to Helm to stop this coup in its tracks, while simultaneously dealing with some deadly family-related issues of his own. Meanwhile, in a storyline continued from The Annihilators, Mac finds himself in the middle of yet another revolution in Costa Verde. The Vanishers, one of the more complicated Matt Helm stories, is unique in several ways. Usually Helm is captured by the enemy in order to complete his mission. Here, for once, Helm‚Äôs boss Mac takes an active part in the action and is the one captured in order to deal with a gang of kidnappers. In most of these books the women are either ruthless foreign agents or na√Øve Americans who discover that however nice Helm may be personally, his profession is not at all nice. The Vanishers features a woman who is neither na√Øve nor an enemy. As punishment for a previous mistake in judgment, Helm is excluded from the real national security problem and exiled to Sweden, where he is kidnapped by a group who fear he may interfere with their plans. Eventually he escapes, figures out his mission and completes it, and helps the Swedes with their mission. The ending is different from any other Matt Helm book, but is consistent with his character.

Van Gogh started with a small study of a section of the garden. Then he worked on two double-square paintings of the full walled garden. The paintings were made in Auvers between May and July 1890, during the last few months of his life. All three paintings are titled Daubigny's Garden and are distinguished by the museums they reside in: Kunstmuseum Basel, Hiroshima Museum of Art and Van Gogh Museum. Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny Van Gogh greatly admired Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny, a French landscape artist associated with the Barbizon school who painted river and coastal scenes en plein air. Daubigny was born in Paris in 1817 and moved to Auvers-sur-Oise in 1860. In 1878 Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo that he was very sad to hear the news that Daubigny had died because his work touched him very deeply, \\"A work that is good may not last forever, but the thought expressed by it will, and the work itself will surely survive for a very long time, and those who come later can do no more than follow in the footsteps of such predecessors and copy their example.\\" When Van Gogh came to Auvers in 1890 Daubigny's widow still occupied their house. He painted Daubigny's garden three times: twice with the entire enclosed garden on double-square canvas and an earlier study of a portion of the garden. Auvers-sur-Oise The pastoral Auvers-sur-Oise region of hills, fields, gardens and cottages attracted artists to it and the surrounding area. Starting in 1850 a railroad line facilitated travel from Auvers from Paris. Artists who came to the area to paint included the Impressionists Armand Guillaumin, Camille Pissarro and Paul C√©zanne. In May 1890 Van Gogh left Saint-R√©my for Auvers where it provided a quieter life than that of Paris, but was still near his brother Theo for visits. In Auvers he was under the care of Paul Gachet, a homeopathic physician, who advised Van Gogh to not worry about his illness and focus on his painting. Gachet, an amateur painter, became a good friend. To Theo he described Gachet as \\"something like another brother.\\" In Van Gogh's first letter to his brother from Auvers he wrote, \\"It is profoundly beautiful, it is the real country, characteristic and picturesque.\\" Paintings The entire garden, Kunstmuseum Basel Van Gogh wrote in a letter dated 23 July 1890 to his brother Theo, \\"Perhaps you'll take a look at this sketch of Daubigny's garden ‚Äì it is one of my most carefully thought-out canvases.\\" In both double- squares, the garden is furnished as a welcoming outdoor living space with a bench, table and chairs. In this painting a woman, cat and blooming flowers bring life to the setting; in the second version of the painting the cat is painted over. The landscaped garden, the focal point, contains a rose bed in the foreground and is surrounded by trees. In the background is a large house and a church with a Romanesque steeple. The beautifully manicured and landscaped Daubigny's Garden elevated the posthumous reputation of Charles- Fran√ßois Daubigny as a successful, cultured man of Auvers. The painting was made on \\"double-square\\" canvas. The initial study, on extended loan to the Kunstmuseum Basel from the Rudolf Staechelin Family Foundation, has a black cat in the foreground towards the left. The entire garden, Hiroshima Museum of Art The painting in which Van Gogh described the sky as \\"pale green\\" is very similar to the first [Kunstmuseum Basel] double-square but lacks the black cat but was later painted over. This slightly later version, also on double-square canvas, is on extended loan to the Hiroshima Museum of Art. Portion of the Garden, Van Gogh Museum Daubigny's Garden 1890 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam The Van Gogh Museum study was made first of a portion of the enclosed garden. He made a little sketch of it for Theo, with a description: \\"In the foreground green and pink grass‚Ä¶ In the center a rose bush, to the right a little gate‚Ä¶ [and] a row of yellow lindens. The house itself is in the background, pink with a roof of bluish tiles.\\" Controversy surrounding the Daubigny's Garden (F776) Prior to World War I questions arose regarding whether one of the double-square canvases was a forgery. After the war legitimate Van Gogh paintings were mixed up with forgeries in the inventory of German art dealer Otto Wacker. Wacker was put on trial after successfully selling a forgery of Van Gogh's self-portrait. Upon testimony of the best Van Gogh experts Wacker was sentenced for his crime, but mystery surrounding the forgery remained. In 1929 Ludwig Justi, the director of the Berlin National Gallery, was particularly interested in the version of Daubigny's Garden (F776) owned by Paris art dealer Paul Rosenberg. French painter and collector Emile Schuffenecker, who was known to have made copies of Van Gogh‚Äôs work, had at one point possessed this Daubigny's Garden. Knowing that there were rumors surrounding the authenticity of the painting, Justi discreetly inquired about its provenance, and received \\"a detailed and reassuring answer.\\" In 1929, about 70 individuals established the Verein der Freunde der Nationalgalerie (Society of Friends of the National Gallery) to purchase art to lend to the National Gallery on a long-term basis. Daubigny's Garden was one of their first purchases, for 240,000 reichsmarks.

In Anglo- Saxon times, she notes, it was part of the manor of Earsham, belonging to Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury (1052-1070): \\"When the Saxon Archbishop Stigand quarrelled with William the Conqueror, his lands, including Stockton, were confiscated by the Crown\\". In 1140 King Stephen granted Stockton, including the manors of Ellingham, Geldeston, Gillingham, Kirby Cane, Winston and Wyndale (Windle), with the right to hold court and set up a gallows, to Hugh Bigod, the newly created Earl of Norfolk. In 1178, Hugh‚Äôs son Ralph, the next owner, obtained exclusive fishing rights on the Waveney from Stockton to Shipmeadow, and the right to cut reeds, like those used to thatch the church (it still has a thatched roof today), and to cut rushes for strewing the floors.\\"Stockton. Historical Notes\\", Tidings online, April 2020 These notes are based on Blomefield and other antiquarian sources. The manor passed through the last Bigod heir, Elisabeth Bigot, to her husband William Garneys, but Stockton and Geldeston did not remain long in the family's possession. In 1447, the year after the death of Garneys' son Ralph, they were occupied by William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk.Colin Richmond, The Paston family in the 15th century: The first phase, Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2002 pbk edition, pp. 144-148.

The Rector at this period, William Stannard, went to fight for the Crown against the Scots. Perhaps Stannard did so against the wishes of the parish, because in 1641 the Town refused to pay 30 shillings for the musket he lost in ‚Äúthe northern expedition‚Äù.

History  Dev√≠nska Nov√° Ves was mentioned for the first time around 1451 as Nov√° Ves. During the 17th-centuries, the village was growing and after an influx of Croats, the village acquired the name Chorv√°tska Nov√° Ves. In the 18th century, a sand mine was built here near Sandberg and later in the 19th century, stone was quarried here as well. In 1848, the village was renamed once more to its current name. In 1918, the village was a site of battle between the Czechoslovak and Hungarian armies as part of fights for Bratislava, and Czechoslovak troops emerged victorious. In 1948, Dev√≠nska Nov√° Ves was near the border of two different political systems, and in 1955 the Iron Curtain was constructed across the territory the village. It was also one of the escape routes to Austria, by swimming across the Morava river. On 1 January 1972, Dev√≠nska Nov√° Ves was made an official borough of Bratislava.

Hamilton took a break from writing Matt Helm novels after this book; the next volume would not appear until 1992. Plot summary Helm is assigned to impersonate a rich oil baron in order to track down a shipment of weapons before it can be used to overthrow the Mexican government. Matt Helm starts by taking the place of an oil millionaire -- one of the assignments where Mac is helping another agency by loaning out the services of his agent, Matt Helm. As usual, Mac is not doing this from purely altruistic purposes and gives Matt his usual warning - \\"Don't trust anyone\\" in the beginning of the novel. Head of the agency borrowing Matt Helm, a man called Somerset, wants Matt to go into Mexico and help trace a shipment of illegal arms, supposedly being smuggled to be supplied to Mexican revolutionaries by the said millionaire Horace Hosmer Cody. In the beginning of the novel, Cody is arrested by Somerset's people and Helm takes his place with a make up job that he thinks will fool no one and it doesn't. Almost all of the story takes place in Mexico where Matt once again runs into his old ally Ramon Solana-Ruiz of the Mexican security. The novel has much intrigue and is typical of Matt Helm style action. Most of the characters turn out to be different than from what they are portrayed at the beginning of the story and many of them go through transformation, including some of the dead characters. Matt, of course, succeeds in the mission completing all of the objectives, sometimes with help from others.

He was described by Sir Compton Mackenzie as the most talented writer about the countryside of his generation. His best-selling trilogy, published in the years immediately after the Second World War - Portrait of Elmbury, Brensham Village and The Blue Field - was followed by a series of novels and self-styled 'country-contentments'. Literary career Moore was the author of more than 40 published works, most of which explored themes relating to rural life in the first half of the 20th century. He also wrote the script of the 1957 film The England of Elizabeth, which is noted for its score composed by Vaughan Williams. From 1943 to 1949 Moore was the organiser of the Tewkesbury Play Festival. He was also the founder and driving force behind the Cheltenham Literary Festival which was inaugurated in 1949. He contributed a weekly column on rural matters to the Birmingham Mail for eighteen years and was a frequent broadcaster on radio. Conservation A talented naturalist from schooldays, Moore was an early campaigner for the conservation of everything connected with the rural scene. Most of his books had a rural setting, and long before the environment came to mainstream media attention, he wrote about some of the negative effects of technological advances on the countryside and rural life. Moore also fought to conserve the architectural heritage of Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire, his native town. Personal life Moore was born in Tewkesbury in 1907, where he is commemorated by the John Moore Primary School and the John Moore Countryside Museum. In the Second World War, he served as a carrier-based pilot in the Fleet Air Arm, and this experience was reflected in several books including a history of the Fleet Air Arm . During the latter part of his life, he lived in the village of Kemerton on the slopes of Bredon Hill, which he popularised as 'Brensham Hill' in a number of his writings. He died in Bristol in 1967.

The character's adventures were written and drawn by Quality Comics editor George Brenner, using the name \\"Wayne Reid\\". Publication history The character was introduced in the story Hugh Hazzard and His Iron Man, and he appeared under that billing for the first 11 issues. Starting with issue #12 (July 1940), the cover billing changed to Bozo the Robot with Hugh Hazzard, and further stories were titled Bozo the Iron Man or Bozo the Robot for the remainder of his run. Bozo and Hazzard made their last appearance in Smash Comics #41 (March 1943). Fictional character biography In the first installment, Commissioner Hunt contacts Hugh Hazzard by signal flare and brings him into the investigation of crimes committed by a mysterious robot. Seeing the robot robbing a jewellery store, Hugh manages to temporarily deactivate it and climbs inside its hollow chest to hitch a ride to the robot's home base. This turns out to be the laboratory of an evil scientist, Dr Von Thorp who is taken to the police by his own robot and later declared insane. The robot is again deactivated, and placed on a garbage scow for disposal at sea, but Hugh Hazzard has ideas of using the robot as a crime- fighting tool. He saves the robot from its watery fate, then names the robot Bozo. In the next installment, Hazzard is shown examining the robot's blueprints, and stating that the robot can be modified to fly. The modified robot, shown flying with a tiny spinning propeller on its head, is again used to foil a crime. Flying would be a part of all subsequent appearances; at times, the robot could fly faster than 400 miles an hour. The robot can also run at 70 miles an hour, and can walk on the bottom of the ocean floor. Hazzard's method of operating Bozo varied -- in some appearances, Hazzard operates the robot remotely; in others, he travels inside the robot and controls it directly, or travels on the robot's back. After the pattern of the first adventure, Hugh Hazzard tended to encounter criminals committing crimes with scientific gadgetry, and these criminals tended to become the victims of their own weapons. As World War II began, Quality Comics addressed the world situation by introducing villain surrogates into their fictional universe. Hugh and Bozo fought \\"Hitlin\\" and \\"the Batzis\\" in Smash Comics #8 (March 1940), and then ended the war the next month in #9 (April 1940) by traveling to \\"Hatvia\\" and defeating Dictator \\"Motler\\" and his associate, \\"Fritz Goeing\\". The wish-fulfillment story ends with a newspaper headline: \\"World Peace Proclaimed\\". The character's final story, in Smash Comics #41, was called \\"Collecting Scrap\\". At the end of the story, neighborhood kids collecting scrap metal for the war chase Bozo, intending to reduce him to scrap. In 1956, Quality Comics characters were sold to DC Comics. Quality's Blackhawk continued to be published without interruption, but most of their other characters languished. While most of the classic Quality superheroes saw print again many years later, Hugh Hazzard has not returned. A robot resembling Bozo did make a single-panel appearance in an issue of James Robinson's Starman (issue #64, April 2000), where the inactive robot was in a store-room with a Japanese collector's horde of Golden Age superhero artifacts. In Robinson's Superman run, Bozo appears alongside other robots including Mekanique, Robotman and various GI Robot models. The robots are part of Sam Lane's Project 7734. Influence Gonzo the Mechanical Bastard, a robot supervillain created for DC's 2006 One Year Later event, was derived from a character proposal by Grant Morrison updating Bozo. The final Gonzo character eventually became something very different: a psychotic android that can impersonate a world leader. References External links *Bozo the Robot (a.k.a.

It was the twenty-sixth installment of the Matt Helm series, and saw the return of the character after a three-year hiatus. Plot summary Matt Helm (code name Eric) is assigned to kill a drug lord after the villain orders the murder of a journalist. But he doesn't kill the drug lord's dog - which is the centerpiece of moralizing on how the real problem is that there is demand for drugs, so why blame the supplier, since even the drug lord's dog is able to resist such temptations? The story starts in Santa Fe where Matt is trying to live a normal life with Jo Beckman from the previous novel \\"The Frighteners\\". At the beginning of the story Jo has left Matt because of his new hobby of shooting. One of the ladies from a previous novel \\"The Infiltrators\\" - Madeleine Ellershaw comes to visit Matt with a complaint that he's having her followed. Matt is being followed by the same kind of people. Madeleine dies violently soon after her appearance. Matt's new friend Mark, who has introduced Matt to this kind of shooting sport, also dies soon after revealing that he was an author hunted by a South American drug lord for writing a book about the drug business. The drug lord puts up a price of one million dollars on his head. After Mark's death Matt teams up, unwillingly, with his widow to go hunt up back up copies of Mark's second book. Some computer jargon and concepts are mentioned when the electronic copies of the book are mentioned and surprisingly Hamilton has managed to keep most of his facts accurate. (Other than calling a diskette a three-and-a-half-inch-by- three-and-a-half-inch which it's not). As usual nothing and nobody is as they seem or are expected. As usual also, Matt undergoes torture and captivity and perils to his life. As usual, he comes up victorious, accomplishing his mission, saving the women and killing the bad guys. Hamilton doesn't deal in the Hollywood-hero-that-can-kill-a-hundred-black-hat-types and Matt is shown to have a better than average amount of brains, professional ruthlessness and courage and sense in balanced amounts. In this book again Matt runs across fanatic world-savers and drug-crusaders with both gunning for his life. The story opens and ends in New Mexico, but the majority of it takes place in South America.

United Kingdom In England and Wales, the MPhys is an undergraduate award available after pursuing a four- year course of study at a university. In Scotland the course has a five-year duration. In some universities, the degree has the variant abbreviation MSci. These are taught courses, with a research element in the final year ‚Äî this can vary from a small component to an entire year working with a research group ‚Äî and are not available as postgraduate qualifications in most cases, although depending on institution the final year can be considered as approximately equivalent to an MSc. Structure In terms of course structure, MPhys degrees usually follow the pattern familiar from bachelor's degrees with lectures, laboratory work, coursework and exams each year. Usually one, or more commonly two, substantial projects are to be completed in the fourth year which may well have research elements. At the end of the second or third years, there is usually a threshold of academic performance in examinations to be reached to allow progression into the final year. Final results are, in most cases, awarded on the standard British undergraduate degree classification scale, although some universities award something structurally similar to 'Distinction', 'Merit', 'Pass' or 'Fail', as this is often the way that taught postgraduate master's degrees are classified. Degree schemes It is usual for there to be some variation in the MPhys schemes, to allow for students to study the area of physics which most interests them. For example, Lancaster University's physics department offer the following schemes: *MPhys Physics *MPhys Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology *MPhys Physics with Particle Physics and Cosmology *MPhys Physics with Space Science *MPhys Physics with Biomedical Physics *MPhys Theoretical Physics *MPhys Theoretical Physics with Mathematics These schemes will usually incorporate the same core modules with additional scheme specific modules.

Shirin Guild is renowned for utilising unconventional materials and manufacturing technologies, which she combines with traditional fabrics and craftsmanship. Guild's innovative, minimalistic garments are made of uniquely devised fabrics, based on yarns made from cashmere, silk, linen, wool, cotton, stainless steel, copper, hemp, bamboo, pineapple and even paper, or combinations thereof. Guild's designs were originally inspired by Iranian peasant clothes and other traditional garments from around the world. Initially known for oversize, square-shaped patterns, designed to take form on the feminine body, in recent years, the designer's style has evolved to embrace a leaner silhouette. This has attracted younger buyers to the brand, which, in general, had previously been favored by the middle aged woman. Complementing her creations, Shirin Guild has formed associations with leading craftspeople to make unique accessories such as handwoven shawls in artistic designs; dip-dyed, hand-felted neckpieces and mittens, and washed leather bags. Guild also designs tightly structured clothes for men in unusual see through materials and colours. Shirin Guild clothes are at the top-end of the designer ready-to-wear market.

Andrew Lang included it in The Lilac Fairy Book. The False Prince and the True A king received word that his son, the prince, and a gentleman had argued over tennis until the other man struck the prince. The prince, though armed, had not returned the attack but only cried. The king was displeased with the prince's cowardice, but decreed that the young man would be brought to court for having attacked the heir to the throne, for which he was likely to die. He let him go wherever he wished in the city, under guard, for the fourteen days before his case was heard. The young man tried to get advice, but no one could advise him on how to escape, because he had struck the heir to the throne. An old woman told him she could save him if he would marry her. He rejected her offer, but on consideration, chased after her and agreed. She had him swear before a priest to marry her and then told him what to say. In court, the young man tells the king that the queen had, while he was away, taken the son of a quarryman and passed him off as her own son. Then, after her death, the king had met a woman and married her in secret, leaving her tokens, but one day he went off to quell a rebellion and while he was gone, his bride vanished. The young man could now tell him that his chamberlain, the bride's father, had recognized the tokens and vowed that the king would not have her until he was willing to own her as his queen. The young man had been born to her in secret. Now he had the tokens to show his true birth. The king owned him as his son. He told him how he had learned the truth and admitted he did not want to marry the old woman because she was old and his father had not chosen her for him. The king insisted that he must keep his promise, and the wedding was held. The prince tried to hunt and forget his old wife, but one day, in the night, he heard a noise and thought it was robbers. It proved to be a young and beautiful woman, who told him that she was his wife and a princess. A wicked fairy had cursed her to that form. A wizard had managed to have the spell break if a prince agreed to marry her as she was before her fifteenth birthday; then, as her fifteenth birthday approached, the wizard had discovered him and told her what she needed to know to save him.

Plot When starting up the game, a short movie is shown. Mickey falls asleep with a book of fairy tales in his lap, later he wakes up in a strange village. A girl (looking like Daisy Duck) comes up to him asking him for help. She says 'the magic crystal' has been stolen from the villagers. Ever since then, the beautiful happiness in her village has been replaced with sadness. Mickey decides to help the villagers and goes after the evil phantom who has stolen the crystal. The game's story has no direct connections to either its prequel, Castle of Illusion, or its sequel, World of Illusion. Gameplay Land of Illusion is a typical platform game, with the player sidescrolling his way through 14 stages, trying to retrieve the crystal to the villagers. Mickey can attack his enemies by picking up an item (such as a stone block) and throwing it at his enemies, or he can jump at them in a sitting pose. Throughout the game, the player can pick up items that imbue Mickey with new abilities, such as a rope for climbing up walls or a potion that can make Mickey shrink in size. Furthermore, the player can then return to previous levels and utilise these items to gain access to previously inaccessible areas. Mickey begins the game with two power stars indicating how many hits he can take by enemies. Power stars can be collected throughout the game to give Mickey more health to a maximum of 5. However, there is one power star on every level making 14 in total. Each star collected after collecting 5 gives full health and an extra try. Most of them are in the inaccessible areas which require many of the special items collected throughout the game. Upon completion of the game, the number of stars the player collects is tallied. Collecting all 14 stars gives a special score bonus. Characters Several well-known Disney characters appear in the game: *Mickey Mouse ‚Äì The main character of the game *Phantom ‚Äì The antagonist of the game. He is the same Horned King who appears in the Disney animated film, The Black Cauldron and the House of Mouse, but is coloured differently. *Daisy Duck ‚Äì A villager who asks for Mickey's help saving the village *Goofy ‚Äì A toymaker *Horace Horsecollar ‚Äì The blacksmith *Minnie Mouse ‚Äì The princess and continued love interest of Mickey *Donald Duck ‚Äì The king Reception The game was generally well received by critics.

Resolution 54 determined that a threat to peace existed within the meaning of Article 39 of the Charter, reiterated the need for a truce, and ordered a cease-fire pursuant to Article 40 of the Charter. Although the phrase \\"Acting under Chapter VII\\" was never mentioned as the basis for the action taken, the chapter's authority was being used.See Patrik Johansson, UN Security Council Chapter VII resolutions, 1946-2002.

Located west of the village of North Woodstock on New Hampshire Route 112, Lost River Reservation is set in Kinsman Notch. One of the White Mountains' major passes, Kinsman Notch lies between Mount Moosilauke and Kinsman Ridge at just under above sea level. Description The Lost River is so-named because the brook draining the southern part of Kinsman Notch disappears below the surface in a narrow, steep-walled glacial gorge. The gorge is partially filled with immense blocks of granite, through the spaces of which the brook cascades along its subterranean course until it eventually emerges and joins the Pemigewasset River, which flows southward from Franconia Notch. Lost River Reservation protects around the gorge and is owned by the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests. Admission to the gorge is by fee. There are stairs down to the gorge area, with a 3/4 mile boardwalk along the gorge. Most caves can be walked or crawled into. The Forest Society maintains two free trails on the Lost River Reservation, which are separate from the gorge area leased to White Mountain Attractions.

He was elected the chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party on June 13, 2009, and served until January 15, 2011. Early life Tom Fetzer attended Jesse O. Sanderson High School in Raleigh, North Carolina. In 1972, while still a student, he delivered an enthusiastic speech in support of United States Senate candidate Jesse Helms. Though eligible to vote in the 1976 presidential election, Fetzer did not vote in any election until 1980. He later attended and graduated from Wake Forest University with a Bachelor of Arts in politics. In the 1980s he worked as a political operative for the National Congressional Club, a political action committee chaired by Helms. He served as its assistant director in 1983. Fetzer began his career in politics with appointments as Assistant Secretary of Natural Resources and Chief Deputy Secretary of the Department of Transportation in the administration of North Carolina Governor James G. Martin, as well as an aide to Senator John Porter East (both Republicans). After entering the private sector, Fetzer worked as a marketing executive. In 1988 Fetzer, as a Republican, challenged Democrat incumbent David Price for the United States House of Representatives seat representing North Carolina's 4th congressional district. Fetzer attempted to link his campaign with George H. W. Bush's presidential candidacy, calling for reducing the national budget deficit without tax increases and strong measures to combat the trade of illegal drugs. He lost the November election by a large margin. Mayor of Raleigh Fetzer ran for office to become Mayor of Raleigh in 1993. He won the November runoff election by a margin of 965 votes (51% of the total votes to Barlow Hergert's 49%). His victory was a surprise to observers; Raleigh had not had a Republican mayor within the populace's living memory. Fezter's success was largely due to the energetic efforts of Wake County Republican Chairman Tom Roberg to mobilize voters. He also benefited from a fiscally conservative shift in the city's politics, which was sparked by the Wake County Taxpayers Association's successful effort to defeat a bond referendum in 1992. As mayor, Fetzer favored tax cuts pushed to curb what he deemed unnecessary public spending. He expressed that public art was a waste of taxpayer funds and opposed the construction of a new convention center in downtown Raleigh. In February 1994 Fetzer announced the creation of the Entrepreneurial Commission for Quality, Service and Efficiency (ECQSE). Tasked with drafting reforms to restructure the municipal administration to improve its functions, Fetzer stated that he hoped it would allow Raleigh to privatize some of its services in a manner similar to actions undertaken by the government of Charlotte. The ECQSE was almost entirely composed of local corporate leaders, which Fetzer maintained was necessary because the private sector promoted entrepreneurship. He wanted the commission to deliver its finals proposals within three months so he could incorporate the changes into the city's budget in June. In the part due to the deadline and to internal disorganization, the ECQSE's suggestions were vague and haphazard, and the city council accused it of being more concerned with cutting costs than increasing efficiency. Ultimately a 7.3% property tax reduction was implemented in June, which, though smaller than originally intended, was the city's first tax cut in three decades. Fetzer claimed the ECQSE's efforts as partially successful, reasoning that their proposals forced municipal officials to reconsider how they used the budget. In September 1996 Hurricane Fran struck North Carolina and caused significant flooding in north Raleigh. Fetzer responded by allocating funds to improve water drainage infrastructure in the area. Fetzer garnered 60% of the vote in his 1995 reelectionEisley, Matthew, and Yonat Shimron. \\"Fetzer beats Nooe in Raleigh.

October 8, 1997. Following the latter victory, he declared that he would not seek election to a fourth term. His personal charisma, organizational skills, and emphasis on crime control and lower taxes helped to solidify the Republican Party's presence in Raleigh, and in part facilitated the election of Republican Paul Coble to succeed him. Later career and political activity After leaving mayoral office, Fetzer served as a fellow at the Kennedy School of Government's Institute of Politics at Harvard University for the Spring 2000 academic semester and director of the Center for Local Innovation at the John Locke Foundation. He then accepted a position with the United States Tennis Association in New York City before returning to Raleigh several years later. He re-engaged in state and local politics as a political consultant at a firm he founded with Mark Stephens, Fetzer/Stephens. He took unpaid leave from his consulting position to serve as U.S. Senator Elizabeth Dole's executive director at the National Republican Senatorial Committee. In late 2008 Fetzer and Stephens closed their consulting firm. In 2009, Fetzer ran for chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party.News & Observer blog: Fetzer running for GOP chair He was elected chairman on June 13 on the second ballot at the party convention. Under his leadership the Republican Party took control of both houses of the state legislature in 2010, the first time this had occurred in over 100 years. Fetzer chose to leave the post of chairman five months before his term expired, and was replaced by Robin Hayes on January 15, 2011.http://www.wbtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=13850189 Fetzer became chairman for Newt Gingrich's presidential campaign in North Carolina in December 2011. In January 2011, Fetzer started a lobbying and media strategy firm, Fetzer Strategic Partners. In 2019 Michael V. Lee announced that he would join Fetzer's firm, which would be renamed Fetzer Lee. In March 2017, Fetzer was elected to the University of North Carolina Board of Governors by the North Carolina Senate. In July 2018 Fetzer became suspicious of a claim made by a candidate applying to become chancellor of Western Carolina University. He asked a private screening firm to investigate the veracity of the claim, and shared its findings with other members of the board. His actions aroused controversy and some of his colleagues criticized him for acting on his own initiative and disclosing the name of a candidate to an external entity.

She was of the VC2-S-AP5 Victory ship design type. Sherburne was named for Sherburne County, Minnesota. She was later converted and renamed USS Range Sentinel (AGM-22), a missile range instrumentation ship. Construction Sherburne was laid down under Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 553, on 18 May 1944, by the Permanente Metals Corporation, Yard No. 2,Richmond, California; launched on 10 July 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Mary Sernach; and commissioned on 20 September 1944, Commander Lannis A. Parker, USN, in command. Service history World War II =Training vessel= Following commissioning, Sherburne proceeded to the Naval Supply Depot at Oakland, California. She remained in the San Francisco area until getting under way for San Pedro, California for shakedown training which she completed on 20 October. The ship then returned to San Francisco to become a training vessel for APA and AP crews being assembled at the Precommissioning Training Center at Treasure Island. During her duty as a training vessel, 24 October to 22 December, she embarked the officers and men of 19 ships for periods of one to five days each for short cruises to the operating areas off Point Reyes. They were given training in ship handling, emergency drills, and in surface and anti-aircraft firing. Upon completion of brief repairs at the Bethlehem Steel Co. in San Francisco, she got underway on 12 January 1945 toward San Diego for amphibious training. From 14 to 29 January, the ship underwent strenuous training in all phases of amphibious operations; and, on completion of this duty, she returned to the San Francisco area to load cargo. =Pacific service= On 15 February, Sherburne departed San Francisco for Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on the morning of 21 February. On 20 March, the ship embarked her first contingent of troops and got underway with a convoy bound for the Marshall Islands. She arrived at Eniwetok on 28 March; and, after discharging cargo, proceeded to Kwajalein, arriving there on 31 March; and then to Ulithi which she reached on 6 April. She discharged cargo and troops at both ports. At Ulithi, she embarked a group of marines; and, on 15 April, the ship headed for Guam, arriving at Apra Harbor the following day. After embarking another group of Marines on 20 April, the ship continued on to Saipan, arriving the next day. On 23 April, she embarked a group of Army troops; and, four days later, the ship sailed in convoy for Okinawa. Sherburne arrived off Okinawa late in the afternoon of 1 May, and immediately began debarking troops and cargo. Operations were delayed by bad weather and air attacks; but, on the morning of 4 May, the ship completed offloading and got underway to return to Ulithi, arriving at that base on 9 May. Sailing the next day, she moored at San Francisco on 24 May. There she embarked troops; and, on 2 June, again sailed for the forward area, this time to the Philippines. She refueled at Eniwetok and Ulithi, and arrived at Manila on the morning of 23 May. On 4 July, she loaded Army troops for Cebu and delivered them there two days later. She then proceeded via Leyte to Biak, where she arrived on 11 July. There she loaded Army troops and sailed for Zamboanga, where she disembarked some of her troops on 17 July. Arriving at Manila two days later, she put the rest of her troops and cargo ashore and shifted to Subic Bay on 25 July for minor repairs and upkeep. On 4 August 1945, Sherburne sailed for Lucena in Tayabas Bay, Luzon, for amphibious training of Army troops. This duty was abruptly terminated at mid-month by the Empire of Japanese capitulation. The ship immediately returned via Manila to Batangas Bay to load troops of the 1st Cavalry Division and the 11th Airborne Division for the occupation of the Tokyo region. Loading was completed on 24 August; and, on the following day, the ship was underway in convoy for Yokohama, Japan. The convoy entered Tokyo Bay early on the morning of 2 September, and proceeded up the bay. Sherburne passed at approximately the time of the reading of the surrender document on board that battleship. As the transport dropped anchor off the Yokohama breakwater, her radio receiver was announcing the final signature of the document. Debarkation of troops was completed in the afternoon; and, on the following day, the ship moored alongside a Yokohama pier to discharge cargo. Unloading was completed that evening; and, on 4 September, the ship was under way to return to Zamboanga for another contingent of occupation troops. On 11 September, Sherburne put into Leyte for fuel and supplies; then continued to Zamboanga, arriving on 16 September. Loading of troops and cargo of the 41st Infantry Division was completed on 19 September. After picking up more troops and boats at Bugo, Mindanao, the ship sailed from Abuyog, Leyte, on 22 September for Kure, Japan. On 23 September, the convoy was diverted to Okinawa because of a delay in preparations at its destination; and the ship anchored in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, the same day. She was forced to sea from 28 September to 1 October to evade Tropical Storm Kate; and, on 2 October, got underway for Japan. The ship entered Bungo Suido early on 5 October; and, after cautiously passing through a succession of mined areas in the Inland Sea, reached Hiro Wan the next day. Debarkation of troops and cargo began immediately and was completed on 8 October. =Operation Magic Carpet= Sherburne was next scheduled for duty in \\"Operation Magic Carpet\\" to return servicemen to the United States; but she was diverted to Okinawa where, from 12 October to 14 November, she served as accommodation ship for a total of over 1,400 survivors of mine vessels and other craft wrecked there in a recent typhoon. On 28 November, the transport arrived at Seattle, Washington, with a group of homeward-bound servicemen from Okinawa. After a month of repairs, she sailed on 28 December, for Okinawa where, after embarking more troops between 15 and 21 January, she delivered them at San Francisco on 5 February. Post-war Sherburne was decommissioned on 3 August 1946; and, after a decade in reserve in Navy custody, was transferred to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) at Suisun Bay, California, 9 September 1958. She was stricken from the Navy List on 1 October 1958. Reactivation as Range Sentinel Over 20 years after her decommissioning, Sherburne was called back to active duty to support the Navy's Polaris and Poseidon fleet ballistic missile flight test program. She was reclassified as a range tracking vessel, AGM-22, on 16 April 1969, and was reacquired from MARAD and reinstated on the Navy list on 22 October 1969. She began conversion at the Northwest Marine Ironworks, Portland, Oregon, on 28 October 1969, renamed Range Sentinel on 26 April 1971, and delivered to the Military Sealift Command (MSC) on 21 October 1971, and placed in service, Sven Rydberg, master. Her conversion included the latest communications, navigation, and missile tracking and monitoring equipment. Range Sentinel continued in service into 1974, as a unit of the MSC Special Projects Fleet, home ported at Port Canaveral, Florida. Fate Range Sentinel was placed out of service at Port Canaveral, 12 June 1997, and again struck from the Naval Register, 3 May 1999. On 19 September 2000, she was laid up in MARAD's James River Reserve Fleet, Fort Eustis, Virginia, with permanent Title transfer 28 July 2001. Range Sentinel was in the James River Reserve Fleet under the care of MARAD, until 19 June 2012, when she was withdrawn from the reserve fleet under domestic sale. As of November 2012, she was being scrapped by BB Metals, Sparrow's Point, Maryland. Awards Sherburne received one battle star for her World War II service.

This lower limit is known as the \\"floor\\". The \\"floor effect\\" is one type of scale attenuation effect (https://methods.sagepub.com/reference/dictionary-of-statistics- methodology/n1744.xml); the other scale attenuation effect is the \\"ceiling effect.\\" Floor effects are occasionally encountered in psychological testing, when a test designed to estimate some psychological trait has a minimum standard score that may not distinguish some test-takers who differ in their responses on the test item content. Giving preschool children an IQ test designed for adults would likely show many of the test-takers with scores near the lowest standard score for adult test-takers (IQ 40 on most tests that were currently normed as of 2010). To indicate differences in current intellectual functioning among young children, IQ tests specifically for young children are developed, on which many test-takers can score well above the floor score. An IQ test designed to help assess intellectually disabled persons might intentionally be designed with easier item content and a lower floor score to better distinguish among individuals taking the test as part of an assessment process.

As a teenager in 1971, Koepcke was the sole survivor of the LANSA Flight 508 plane crash, then survived eleven days alone in the Amazon rainforest. She survived a fall of 3,000 meters, still strapped to her seat.  Her life  Koepcke was born in Lima, Peru, in 1954 to German parents who worked at the Museum of Natural History, Lima. She was the only child of biologist Hans-Wilhelm Koepcke and ornithologist Maria Koepcke. When Koepcke was fourteen, her parents left Lima to establish Panguana, a research station in the Amazon rainforest. She became a \\"jungle child\\" and learned survival techniques. Educational authorities disapproved and Koepcke was forced to return to the Deutsche Schule Lima Alexander von Humboldt to take her examinations. She graduated on 23 December 1971.  Crash  Maria, Juliane's mother, was working in Lima when Koepcke was about to graduate from high school. Maria had wanted to return to Panguana on 19 or 20 December 1971, but Juliane wished to attend her graduation ceremony on 23 December. Maria agreed for Juliane to stay for longer and, instead, they scheduled a flight on Christmas Eve. All flights were booked, aside from one with L√≠neas A√©reas Nacionales S.A. (LANSA). Her father Hans- Wilhelm urged Maria to avoid flying with the airline, which had a poor reputation. They booked the flight, nonetheless. The LANSA Lockheed L-188 Electra OB-R-941 commercial airliner was struck by lightning during a severe thunderstorm and broke-up in mid-air, disintegrating above the ground. Koepcke, still strapped onto her seat, survived the fall to earth, suffering a broken collarbone, a gash to her left leg and to her right arm, and her right eye was swollen shut. \\"I was definitely strapped in it [the airplane seat] when I fell,\\" she said later. \\"It must have turned and buffered the crash; otherwise I wouldn't have survived.\\" Koepcke's first priority was to find her mother, who had been seated next to her, but her search proved unsuccessful. She would later learn that her mother initially had survived the crash also, only to die of her injuries several days later. Surviving on sweets she found at the site, Koepcke waded downstream through knee-high water, as her father had taught her that tracking downstream should eventually lead to civilization. After ten days, she found a boat moored near a small shelter. She poured gasoline from the fuel tank on her wounds to clear them of maggots and spent the night in the shelter. Koepcke said: \\"I remained there but I wanted to leave. I didn't want to take the boat because I didn't want to steal it.\\" The next morning, a small group of local fishermen discovered her and brought her to their village.Banister interview, 20:20. The following day, a local pilot volunteered to fly her to a hospital in Pucallpa,Banister interview, 21:00. where she was reunited with her father.Banister interview, 22:00. After recovering from her injuries, Koepcke assisted search parties in locating the crash site and recovering the bodies of victims. Her mother's body was discovered on 12 January 1972.  Aftermath  Koepcke's unlikely survival has been the subject of much speculation. It is known that she was belted into her seat and thus somewhat shielded and cushioned, but it also has been theorized that the outer seats of the row‚Äîthose on each side of Koepcke, which remained attached to hers as part of a row of three‚Äîfunctioned as a parachute and slowed her fall. The impact may have been lessened further by a thunderstorm updraft and the thick foliage at her landing site. She moved to Germany, where she fully recovered from her injuries. Like her parents, she studied biology at the University of Kiel and graduated in 1980. She received a doctorate from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and returned to Peru to conduct research in mammalogy, specializing in bats. Koepcke published her thesis, Ecological study of a bat colony in the tropical rain forest of Peru, in 1987. Now known as Juliane Diller, she serves as librarian at the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology in Munich. Her autobiography, When I Fell From the Sky (), was released on 10 March 2011 by Piper Verlag, for which she received the Corine Literature Prize in 2011. In 2019, the government of Peru awarded her the Order of Merit for Distinguished Services, in the degree of Grand Officer.  Portrayal in films  Having been widely reported, Koepcke's experience is the subject of one feature-length fictional film and one documentary. The first was the low-budget, heavily-fictionalized, I miracoli accadono ancora (1974) by Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Maria Scotese; it was released in English as Miracles Still Happen (1974) and sometimes is called The Story of Juliane Koepcke. In that film, she was portrayed by British actress Susan Penhaligon. Twenty-five years later, director Werner Herzog revisited the story in his film Wings of Hope (1998). In 1971, while location scouting for Aguirre, the Wrath of God, ironically, Herzog would have been on the same flight as Koepcke, but for a last-minute change of his itinerary. Koepcke accompanied him on a visit to the crash site, a journey she described as \\"a kind of therapy\\" for her.Banister interview, 24:20.

With Cannon Mills Cannon Mills manufacturing plants were located mainly in and around Concord, North Carolina and particularly in nearby Kannapolis, North Carolina, a company-owned town created and named after the Cannon family. Kannapolis was the largest unincorporated town in the nation for many years. Due to the support of the Cannon family the YMCA in Kannapolis enjoyed one of the highest memberships in the nation and had excellent facilities. Cannon Mills headquarters was in Concord, and the family mansion in downtown Concord is now part of the First Presbyterian Church complex. There were multiple plants employing thousands of people during this time, running three shifts and producing sheets and towels. Cannon was a great industrialist and involved in philanthropy in the community which included churches, schools, hospitals and libraries. Many of the families that worked in the mill lived in company houses generally of clapboard with 2-3 bedrooms and one bath and rented to the employees by the company at very cheap rates. The downtown of Kannapolis was constructed in the Colonial style, mostly brick and very elegant and directly because of the Cannon family. While there were no unions in any of the operations, work was generally good during this era, and many people from other communities flocked to Kannapolis during the Great Depression because of jobs. The mill was the prominent employer in the area and there were no other significant manufacturing operations during that time.

GameZone reviewer Steven Hopper notes that \\"the game features a unique aesthetic that feels like a Tim Burton version of a Jhonen Vasquez comic.\\" Aside from the main plots, there are also a number of small bonus mysteries that involve much simpler tasks. There is also a Touch Notebook containing a list of major items in the game the player has touched. The game is entirely controlled via the touch screen. Tapping a location on the screen will talk to a character or examine an object. The player has an inventory of items collected, and may use them on other items or objects in the environment. The player can also communicate with the characters along conversation trees or present inventory items to them to learn new information. Mackenzie's pet mushroom, Funghi, is used as an aid in some puzzles. Characters *Mackenzie: The lead character of the game. As a young girl, she runs a detective agency with the help of Cromwell. Her personality is the most \\"ordinary\\", in contrast to the otherwise bizarre world around her. Although she's the most mature out of her friends, she can also often gain a typically childish amusement from doing \\"naughty\\" thing. She keeps a \\"Touch List\\" of things she has touched and what they feel like. *Penelope: One of the girls that lives in the condominiums in town and friend of Mackenzie.

However, she is rather air-headed, and has been known to disappear for a time, or even not talk to anyone (including herself, except for pantomime) for a whole week. She is the one who will give Mackenzie all her cases during the game and is one of the main focuses of the first three episodes. *Chloe: Another girl in town, and while friend of Mackenzie, tends to be her rival in trying to solve cases. Chloe generally takes actions before figuring out their consequences on herself or those around her, such when she broke into and ransacked Penelope's apartment for evidence. *Cromwell: Butler for Mackenzie and also a genius inventor. Cromwell is a man who has worked for Mackenzie's family for over 300 years. He is often coming up with inventions, and becomes disgruntled if he isn't given the chance to show them off to others. *Funghi: A living mushroom that is kept as a pet by Mackenzie and travels with her as she moves about town. *Deijƒ´ („Éá„Ç§„Ç∏„Éº ) / Daisy: A goth girl that works at the local boutique, and lives in the apartment above Penelope, having to put up with her loud \\"ditzy\\" antics as a result. At first hostile towards Penelope and Mackenzie, she becomes friendly later on. Plot Screenshot from Touch Detective Mackenzie learns that in order to join the ranks of the Great Detective Society, she must solve four cases and submit her investigation report to the Society. Fortunately for her, several cases seem to pop up around town. ;Episode 1 - Robbery. The reality of a fanciful dream: Penelope comes to Mackenzie because she claims her dreams are being stolen. Mackenzie first acquires a special invention from Cromwell so that she can see into Penelope's dreams and understands what happens: a strange creature is seen fleeing from Penelope's just before she wakes up. Mackenzie investigates further and finds a way to enter the Dream World, but finds no one there that can help because the rest of the town is not yet asleep. Finding a way to convince everyone to fall asleep at the same time that Penelope does, she is then able to stop the fleeing figure and reveal it to be the pastry chef in town. The chef admits to the crime, using the crystallized dreams as an ingredient in her Sweet Dream Cake dessert. Fortunately, Penelope and the chef agree that the chef will only take Penelope's dreams once a week. ;Episode 2 - Disappearance. The truth hidden in the cosmos: Penelope goes missing, and upon investigation, it looks like her room was broken into. However, it is revealed that Chloe, trying to find Penelope before Mackenzie, broke in and tried to find evidence. However, regardless of Chloe's bumbling, Mackenzie is led to the planetarium and its strange owner, as well as a little girl named Lynsey who seems to like playing with dolls. After catching the owner buying girls clothes in sizes too large for Lynsey, Mackenzie soon discovers that the planetarium owner lured Penelope and now is keeping her in a secret room under mind control in order for her to be Lynsey's friend. Mackenzie is able to rescue Penelope, have the owner captured, and befriends Lynsey so she won't be lonely again. ;Episode 3 - Stranded. The miracle of an innocent heart: Penelope claims that an ice fairy is stranded at the ice skating rink, the only cold place in town, but Mackenzie cannot see it though she can sense it. The owner of the rink is tired of living in the cold and is looking to shut the rink down, causing the temperature in the rink to rise and threaten the life of the fairy. Chloe comes up with two near-disastrous ideas for saving the fairy, but Mackenzie realizes all they need to do is make it snow so the fairy can be get out from the ice rink and to a more comfortable location. With the help of the local fortune teller Mackenzie helps Chloe in enchanting an \\"angel summoning spell\\" (actually a magical girl theme song), which, through the power of Chloe's will, temporarily transforms Penelope into an angel that can make it snow. The fairy returns home after a parting conversation with Chloe, with it being very heavily implied that they share a requited crush. ;Episode 4 - Assault. The tragedy of a past grudge:Penelope claims that a murder happened at the circus in town, though it is only a flea circus, and it's actually an assault. Apparently, the circus used to be a larger attraction, but when it shut down, many of the performers took up residence in town. Mackenzie investigates to find that something did attack the fleas, though initially suspecting a flea as the culprit. However, the supposed culprit flea ends up near-dead himself, in a supposed locked room attack. This leads to an initial speculation of self-inflicted injury, however Mackenize deduces that a human sized culprit could have picked up the box the flea was in and shaken it to cause the injuries. When a large anvil nearly kills all the fleas, the trail leads to Dover, one of the ex-performers. His old circus act, animating tattoos on his back, was ruined due to a flea bite, and has been out of work since, and thus took revenge on the flea circus to try to get back into stardom. Dover tries to kill a flea, however, Mackenzie is able to stop him. Unfortunately, the circus ringleader accidentally kills it anyway. Following the successful resolution of all four cases, Cromwell informs Mackenzie that she has been accepted into the Great Detective Society. However it transpires that he mistakenly submitted Mackenzie's \\"Touch List\\" instead of her investigation report. She is given the official title of \\"Touch Detective\\" as a result, to Mackenzie's shame. Reception As of March 4, 2007, Touch Detective has an average rating of 65% from GameRankings, with most critics praising the presentation of the game, but panning the actual gameplay. IGN notes that \\"the visual style is awesome, the presentation is great, and the audio is extremely entertaining\\", but otherwise the game \\"is littered with confusing puzzles, uninformative AI, and an overall shallow experience.\\" Legacy A sequel, Touch Detective 2 ¬Ω, was released in North America on October 9, 2007. In Japan, the character of Funghi became widely popular and a game was released for the iPhone and iPad on June 30, 2011, and for Android on December 21, 2011.

Freeman/After the Battle Magazine: Published by Battle of Britain Prints International Ltd: The airfield was built in 1942 by John Laing & Sons Ltd. The airfield had three intersecting runways laid with concrete which were encircled by a three and a half mile perimeter road.Aerial photo of RAF Thorpe Abbotts from Multimap.Com The perimeter road had hard standings for fifty aircraft. There were two hangars, a technical site and a domestic area. The station became operational in June 1943 when the 100th Bomb Group of the United States Army Air Forces took up residency equipped with the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. The group became known as the ‚Äò‚ÄôBloody 100th‚Äô‚Äô because of the heavy losses incurred by the group on a number of their combat missions.Airfields of the Eighth, Then and Now, By Roger A.

The USAAF left the station in December 1945 when the airfield was returned to the RAF and it remained inactive until April 1956 when the airfield was finally closed (de-requisitioned). The land owned by Sir Rupert Mann has been returned to agricultural use but the perimeter road remained intact until 1986 when it was demolished. Some of the buildings including the control tower still survive. Today the old control tower has been fully restored and contains a museum dedicated to the famous 'Bloody Hundredth' Bomb Group. The Museum Web-site The museum tells the story of Thorpe Abbotts and portrays every-day life on an American bomber base. A D-4 link trainer is on display, while a B-24 tail turret is undergoing restoration. Special events and reunions are frequently staged. Eddie the Ghost From time to time, visitors to the museum report an overpowering presence within the control tower, occasionally accompanied by the brief glimpse of an airman dressed in full flying gear.Ghost Fields of East Anglia by Martin W Bowman, Page 114, Published by Halsgrove 2007 The sound of VHF chatter and the sound of aircraft have also been heard. These strange apparitions are not a new phenomenon. \\"Eddie the Ghost\\", as American personnel nicknamed him, began to appear after the first Berlin raids by the RAF's Bomber Command, with \\"Eddie's\\" apparitions noted as happening from 1942; he was reported as walking through walls of the airmen‚Äôs quarters. Stories of the ghost persisted with some of the men taking their carbines to bed with them. Fearing an accident, Colonel Jeffrey, the station (base) commander, forbade all talk of Eddie on penalty of court martial. Today, sightings are less frequently recorded although Eddie is occasionally seen when the tower is locked at night. He appears at the first-floor window looking out as if to say good night.

He plays guitar, bass, and is a singer-songwriter. He draws his inspiration from his studies of poetry, art, and music from around the world. The style of his music takes on aspects of folk, pop, soul, and rock.  Biography  New York City based singer-songwriter Pete Francis grew up in Riverside, Connecticut, the youngest of four children. He was influenced musically by such artists as Van Morrison, Cat Stevens, Tom Waits, Joni Mitchell, and Miles Davis. As a student at Middlebury College in Vermont, Francis met guitarist/bassist/songwriter Chad Urmston and drummer Brad Corrigan and the three formed a band. Originally named One Fell Swoop, the group soon changed its name to Dispatch. In 2001, after six years and five releases, Dispatch went on an extended hiatus. Francis released his debut solo album, So They Say, in 2001 on his Scrapper Records label. The album's songs, which were generally recorded in one take, mostly relate to his family and past girlfriends. The writing was also inspired by his experience at National University of Ireland, Galway, where he studied literature abroad for six months. Francis' next album, Untold, was released in 2003 by Hollywood Records. In a review of the album, Christopher Byrd of The Washington Post wrote: \\"From the happy-hour lasciviousness of 'One Train' to the Hendrix-inspired 'Coal Miner' to the folksy tenderness of the Sept. 11-inspired 'Beneath the Fire,' Francis shows impressive musical range. Still, while it's possible to applaud him for his disregard of contemporary musical trends, it's hard not to feel that his toned-down Black Crowes approach to music corsets him a bit too much in VH1-friendly nostalgia.\\" Gregory McIntosh of Allmusic remarked that Francis \\"possesses many of the gifts that make a great and unique songwriter, but there is something hidden within many of the tracks on Untold that suggests he has the want, but not the courage, to break from the humdrum early-'90s college rock clich√©s.\\" Two songs from the album, \\"Stones\\" and the title track, were featured in first-season episodes of the One Tree Hill television series. Francis released Good To Finally Know in 2004 and Everything Is One in 2006. The latter album features singer-songwriter Craig Dreyer, who wrote or co-wrote eight of the album's ten songs and performs on all of them. Francis' fifth album, Iron Sea and the Cavalry, was released in 2008. Regis Behe of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review said Francis' writing style was like \\"a quasi-travelogue, yet one that has no real starting or end points, but traverses a distance that transcends geography.\\" Alan Brown of PopMatters described the album as \\"a reflective affair that brings to mind the young Cat Stevens, especially on the melancholy album highlight 'Stowaway'\\". Francis released The Movie We Are In in 2010. Adam Richter of The Express-Times called album track \\"Light Up My Day\\" a \\"dud\\", but felt that \\"on most of the record, Francis sings songs that have engaging hooks and deft arrangements.\\"  Discography  For discography of Dispatch, see Dispatch Discography * 2001: So They Say - Scrapper Records * 2003: Untold - Scrapper Records * 2004: Good To Finally Know - Scrapper Records * 2006: Everything Is One- Scrapper Records * 2008: Iron Sea and the Cavalry- Scrapper Records * 2009: Wake the Mountain w/Barefoot Truth- Scrapper Records * 2010: The Movie We Are In- Scrapper Records * 2013: Immodal Implozego - ii Records * 2015: Dragon Crest Collective Volume 1  Equipment  Instruments * Nash Presicion Bass * Modulus Bass * 1979 Fender Telecaster * 1980 Gibson 335 electric guitar * 1930s National Resonator * 1940 Gibson 135 Jazz Box * Collings D-1 acoustics Amplifiers * Noise Iconoclast Amplifier Effects * Boss TU2 Chromatic Tuner * Fulltone Clyde Wah Deluxe * Fulltone OCD Overdrive * Boss Analog Delay  External links   Official  * Pete Francis website * https://web.archive.org/web/20110719050249/http://www.jugendschrift.de/inhalte/pete.html  Informational  *  References  1981 births Living people 20th-century American singers 21st-century American singers American bass guitarists American male bass guitarists American male singer-songwriters American singer- songwriters American rock guitarists American rock singers 20th-century American bass guitarists 21st-century American bass guitarists People from Riverside, Connecticut 20th- century male singers 21st-century male singers Dispatch (band) members ","title":"Pete Francis Heimbold"},{"id":"6436795","text":"Yeni ≈ûafak (\\"New Dawn\\") is a conservative Turkish daily newspaper. The newspaper is known for its hardline support of president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan and the AK Parti and has a very close relationship with the Turkish government. It, together with other media organizations in Turkey, has been accused of using hate speech to target minorities and opposition groups. History Yeni ≈ûafak founding editor was Mehmet Ocaktan. In the beginning, Yeni ≈ûafak was known for harboring both liberal and Islamist columnists. Yeni ≈ûafak was acquired by Albayrak Holding in 1997, which had close ties with then mayor of Istanbul, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. After ƒ∞brahim Karag√ºl became the editor-in-chief of Yeni ≈ûafak, the newspaper became a hardline supporter of then prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. More Islamist columnists were employed, while liberals like K√ºr≈üat Bumin were fired from the newspaper because of their critical views of Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan and the AK Parti. Controversies Fabricated Noam Chomsky interview On August 26, Noam Chomsky accused the pro-government Yeni ≈ûafak newspaper of fabricating parts of an interview that was done with him via email, including inventing questions and answers and altering criticism of Erdoƒüan's approach to Egypt and Syria into an assertion that Turkey \\"stood with the oppressed people in Syria and Egypt\\". The administration of Yeni ≈ûafak denied the accusation and promised to release the original English content of the emails. However, the released original was full of grammatical mistakes. Later it was found out that Yeni ≈ûafak used Google Translate to translate fabricated Turkish content into English, and presented the translation as the original interview. After the grammatical errors, particularly \\"milk port\\", became a sensation on social media, Yeni ≈ûafak finally admitted some parts were fabricated and removed the entire interview from its web site. Disinformation during Gezi Protests Yeni ≈ûafak newspaper was a primary source of disinformation during 2013‚Äì14 protests in Turkey. According to a report published by Hrant Dink Foundation, Yeni ≈ûafak was the primary newspaper generating hate speech against Gezi protesters. PM Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan said that they would release security camera footage to prove this had occurred. However, the imam of Dolmabah√ße Mosque denied the paper's allegations and no footage was released to the public. Later, the imam (who is a state employee of the mosque) was transferred to a different city. The paper also claimed a headscarved woman was attacked by a gang of shirtless protesters near Dolmabahce Mosque at a tram station on June 1, 2013. On February 14, 2014, several months after the protests had ended, security camera footage showed that there had been no attack on a woman wearing a headscarf by protesters on that date. The woman and Prime Minister Erdoƒüan had claimed in press conferences and political rallies that protesters had attacked her and her baby. On June 10, Yeni ≈ûafak claimed that a theatrical play called \\"Mi Minor,\\" allegedly supported by an agency in the United Kingdom, had held rehearsals for a \\"revolution\\" in Turkey for months. On July 14 Yeni ≈ûafak published an article, titled \\"The Gezi Protestors' Horrible Plan for Istanbul,\\" on their website that claimed that Gezi protesters were conspiring to undermine the government by wasting water from the reservoirs supplying Istanbul. After the article became the object of nationwide mockery, Yeni ≈ûafak removed it from their website. Other disinformation incidents On January 15, 2016, Yeni ≈ûafak published a video purportedly showing live audience members of the prime-time Beyaz Show talk show chanting slogans in support of outlawed Kurdish leader Abdullah √ñcalan. British investigative news agency D8 News published a forensic analysis demonstrating that the audio track was modified before publication, adding voices sampled from an unrelated protest. The article also presented evidence that Yeni ≈ûafak editors likely attempted to cover up their claims rather than issuing a formal retraction. The falsification incident was subsequently corroborated and covered by other news outlets in Turkey. Anti-Semitism On July 11, 2014, Yeni ≈ûafak columnist ƒ∞brahim Sancak resorted to hate speech against Jews. On July 11, 2014, Yeni ≈ûafak columnist Yusuf Kaplan resorted to hate speech against Jews. On July 23 and 30 2014, Yeni ≈ûafak columnist ƒ∞brahim Tenekeci resorted to hate speech against Jews and identified them as \\"eternal pain of humanity\\". Anti-LGBT On June 6, 2012, Yeni ≈ûafak columnist A. Fuat Erdoƒüan identified homosexuality as perversion. On May 13, 2013, Yeni ≈ûafak columnist Yusuf Kaplan identified sexual identities other than heterosexuality as perversion. Anti-Abortion On June 6, 2012, Yeni ≈ûafak columnist A. Fuat Erdoƒüan resorted to hate speech against pro-abortion women.

Biography Nelsova was born as Sara Katznelson in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, to parents of Jewish-Russian descent. Nelsova first performed at the age of five in Winnipeg. She eventually moved with her family to London, England, where she studied at the London Cello School with its principal, Herbert Walenn.Cellist.nl She was heard by Sir John Barbirolli and introduced by him to Pablo Casals, from whom she received additional lessons. In 1932, still aged only 13, she gave a London debut recital and appeared as soloist with Sir Malcolm Sargent and the London Symphony Orchestra. During World War II she was principal cellist of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and in 1942 made her United States solo debut at Town Hall in New York. From 1942 to 1944, she was cellist of the Conservatory String Quartet. In 1949 Nelsova moved to London, where she introduced to Britain new works by Samuel Barber, Paul Hindemith, Dmitri Shostakovich and Ernest Bloch, who dedicated his three suites for unaccompanied cello to her. She premiered Hugh Wood's concerto at the 1969 Promenade concerts. In 1955 she became an American citizen, and performed as a soloist for many major orchestras, including Boston, Winnipeg, Montreal and the New York Philharmonic. She also toured extensively, and in 1966 was the first North American cellist to play in the Soviet Union. Nelsova promoted the Elgar Cello Concerto when it was rarely heard, long before Jacqueline du Pr√© appeared. Nelsova played it in concert and in recital with a piano reduction of the orchestral score. From 1966 to 1973 she was married to the American pianist Grant Johannesen, with whom she often performed and recorded.Steinberg, Michael, \\"Johannesen, Grant,\\" in New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians Her dignified, introspective readings of Bloch's Schelomo and Barber's Cello Concerto were both recorded with the composers conducting. (She later re-recorded Schelomo under Ernest Ansermet, also for the Decca- London label.) She played a Stradivari cello, the \\"Marquis de Corberon\\" of 1726. She taught at the Juilliard School in New York City from 1962 to 2002 (the year of her death). In 1978, Gerhard Samuel composed \\"In Memoriam DQ\\" for Solo Cello (copyright 1990 MMB Music), for Zara Nelsova, which was first performed on January 7, 1980.

On 5 November 2010, at about 3:30 pm, a cement mixer lorry fell off the bridge over the railway 50 metres north-east of the station, and landed on carriages of a train accelerating away from the station. No-one was killed. Witnesses stated that the rear of the lorry crashed through the parapet of the bridge and dragged the whole vehicle over the side of the bridge. The eight- carriage train, operated by South West Trains, was working the 15:05 Guildford to London Waterloo. The train was formed of two Class 455 electric multiple units. The lorry, loaded with concrete and weighing 24 tonnes, landed on the sixth carriage, severely crushing the end of the roof. Further damage was sustained by the fifth, seventh and eighth carriages, with the last of these being derailed at its trailing bogie, although the train remained upright. British Transport Police reported that six people on board the train sustained minor injuries, whilst the driver of the lorry had sustained more serious injuries. This was later revised to two serious and five minor injuries. The Class 455 electric multiple unit involved has since been fully repaired using a rebuilt carriage from a Class 210 diesel multiple unit and returned to service in July 2013.

Here \\\\Sigma is required to be closed and oriented. Virtual knots were first introduced by . Overview In the theory of classical knots, knots can be considered equivalence classes of knot diagrams under the Reidemeister moves. Likewise a virtual knot can be considered an equivalence of virtual knot diagrams that are equivalent under generalized Reidemeister moves. Virtual knots allow for the existence of, for example, knots whose Gauss codes which could not exist in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. A virtual knot diagram is a 4-valent planar graph, but each vertex is now allowed to be a classical crossing or a new type called virtual. The generalized moves show how to manipulate such diagrams to obtain an equivalent diagram; one move called the semi-virtual move involves both classical and virtual crossings, but all the other moves involve only one variety of crossing. Virtual knots are important, and there is a strong relation between Quantum Field Theory and virtual knots. Virtual knots themselves are fascinating objects, and having many connections to other areas of mathematics. Virtual knots have many exciting connections with other fields of knots theory. The unsolved problem shown is an important motivation to the study of virtual knots. See section 1.1 of this paper [KOS] for the background and the history of this problem. Kauffman submitted a solution in the case of the product manifold of closed oriented surface and the closed interval, by introducing virtual 1-knots . It is open in the other cases. Witten‚Äôs path integral for Jones polynomial is written for links in any compact 3-manifold formally, but the calculus is not done even in physics level in any case other than the 3-sphere (the 3-ball, the 3-space R3). This problem is also open in physics level. In the case of Alexander polynomial, this problem is solved. A classical knot can also be considered an equivalence class of Gauss diagrams under certain moves coming from the Reidemeister moves. Not all Gauss diagrams are realizable as knot diagrams, but by considering all equivalence classes of Gauss diagrams we obtain virtual knots. A classical knot can be considered an ambient isotopy class of embeddings of the circle into a thickened 2-sphere. This can be generalized by considering such classes of embeddings into thickened higher-genus surfaces. This is not quite what we want since adding a handle to a (thick) surface will create a higher-genus embedding of the original knot. The adding of a handle is called stabilization and the reverse process destabilization. Thus a virtual knot can be considered an ambient isotopy class of embeddings of the circle into thickened surfaces with the equivalence given by (de)stabilization. Some basic theorems relating classical and virtual knots: *If two classical knots are equivalent as virtual knots, they are equivalent as classical knots. *There is an algorithm to determine if a virtual knot is classical. *There is an algorithm to determine if two virtual knots are equivalent. It is important that there is a relation among the following. See the paper [KOS] cited above and below. * Virtual equivalence of virtual 1-knot diagrams, which is a set of virtual 1-knots. * Welded equivalence of virtual 1-knot diagrams * Rotational welded equivalence of virtual 1-knot diagrams * Fiberwise equivalence of virtual 1-knot diagrams Virtual 2-knots are also defined.

E. Modesitt, published in 2004. Plot introduction Flash is set in a future Earth of the 22nd century, chronologically prior to its published predecessor Archform: Beauty. Humanity is still recovering from environmental disasters of the 21st century, but technology provides enough material resources for everyone. Earth's old nations have merged into continental governments - such as NorAm, United Europe, and Sinoplex - many of which are partially or wholly under the sway of various multinational corporations. Various wars are in progress, including an independence movement of colonists on Mars. The protagonist is Jonat DeVrai, a talented market research consultant and former Marine Corps officer who happens to have retained nanite combat enhancements that should be removed from retiring soldiers. As usual in Modesitt's books, DeVrai does not seek power; he is forced to exercise it because of others' attempts to use him in their designs to gather power to themselves. In addition to normal humans, the world of Flash also includes: * Ascendants: upper-class people who were genetically improved as zygotes. Tall, attractive, and well-to-do, Ascendants disproportionately hold positions of power. * Cydroids: non-sentient constructs made from cloned human tissue. They are operated by telepresence and often contain technological enhancements. Summary After obtaining the rank of Lt. Col in the NorAm Marines, Jonat DeVrai resigns his commission after growing disenchanted with the realities of warfare for economic gains. Using his military benefits, DeVrai begins a new career and obtains an advanced degree and creates a more accurate model for measuring the effects of \\"prod-placement.\\" DeVrai's practice for ethical, high caliber assessments brings him to the attention of the Centre for Societal Research, a generally nonpartisan research group. The Centre commissions a study regarding potential abuses of \\"prod-placement\\" techniques in political campaigns. While the study is intended to be used by the leaders of some of the top Multis (companies), attempts on DeVrai's life and the murder of his sister and her husband, force DeVrai to risk his life in an effort to set things right. DeVrai receives help in the form of the self-aware Cy-droid Paula Anthane and the shadowy force behind Central Four. DeVrai has become a pawn on more than one chessboard. Will he have the chance to set things right? Will he be able to avenge the murder of his sister that left his niece and nephew orphans, or will the multiple plots to remove DeVrai from the board finally catch up to him? Themes Many themes are touched upon in the book - artificial intelligence, product placement, the nature of self-consciousness, the use of clones as remote-controlled robots and the ethical implications thereof, subliminal influencing, and the knotty relationship between following the law and doing what's right. Struggles for control and power dominate the book. The story combines sometimes violent action with character interactions. The hero's struggle to parent his children while at the same time engineering the violent demise of the antagonists provides much of the novel's tension. Reception Frieda Murray in her review for Booklist praised the novel calling it \\"a marvelous thriller that plausibly extrapolates from current possibilities in IT, AI, media, and crime, it also constitutes the way for newcomers to get acquainted with Modesitt‚Äîat his best.\\" Kirkus Reviews was also positive about the novel saying \\"Modesitt's abundant novelistic virtues--great characters and plotting, impressive attention to detail--aside: this is smart, aware, provocative, and engrossing on several political, economic, and professional levels.\\" Publishers Weekly said \\"Modesitt strives for emotional rather than intellectual satisfaction.

Propulsion was by a direct connected, four cylinder, double opposed piston Sun-Doxford diesel developing 6,000 shaft horsepower at 92 revolutions on the single diameter, pitch screw. Piston bore was and combined stroke of . At the time this was the most powerful marine diesel built in the United States and was capable of operating two hours under 25% overload for 7,500 horsepower. Exhaust heat, or oil for port or emergencies, drove a steam generator providing steam for cooking, heating and hot water services. Three 250 kilowatt diesel generators provided electrical service. Navy acquisition On 4 June 1941 the Maritime Commission, Division of Emergency Shipping, announced negotiated acquisition of twenty-eight vessels of which twenty-one were to be turned over to the Navy, Mormacwren being one, and seven to be turned over to the Army. Mormacwren was delivered to the Navy on 6 June 1941 with conversions made at the Boston Navy Yard. On 15 June 1941 the ship was commissioned as USS Algorab (AK-25), named for a star in the constellation Corvus, at Boston, Massachusetts with Commander Thomas B. Inglis in command. On 1 February 1943 Algorab was reclassified as an attack cargo ship, hull number AKA-8. She served as a commissioned ship for 4 years and 5 months. Service history 1941 Following her commissioning, the cargo ship held shakedown along the East Coast. On 4 October, she proceeded to Little Placentia Harbor, Newfoundland. There she joined an Iceland-bound convoy, sailed on 12 October, and reached Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur on 9 November. After discharging her cargo, the ship returned to New York City, where she underwent repairs and alterations. She got underway again on 6 December and steamed to Norfolk. 1942 On 5 February 1942, Algorab sailed to the Caribbean with general cargo on board. She stopped at St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. After loading raw sugar in Cuba, the ship carried it to Baltimore. She moved to New York City shortly thereafter and embarked Army troops for transportation to the South Pacific. She transited the Panama Canal; made port calls at San Diego and San Francisco, California; then continued on to Nukualofa, Tongatapu. Algorab reached Nukualofa on 27 June; then retraced her course to San Francisco; and, upon her return, began a period of repairs. Algorab left San Francisco on 9 August bound via the Panama Canal for Norfolk. While conducting a tactical maneuver in convoy on 11 September, she collided with and suffered extensive damage in the forepart of the ship. Twenty-three feet of her bow was sheared off and one of her bulkheads buckled. One of her crewmen was killed. However, the ship was able to continue unassisted and reached Norfolk on 13 September. Her repairs completed on 7 October, Algorab loaded and proceeded in company with Transport Division (TransDiv) 5 to Mehdia, French Morocco. She was scheduled to take part in the landings in North Africa. These began on 8 November, and Algorab provided landing boats for assault troops. Ten days later, after completing her role in the successful invasion, she left the area on 18 November bound for Norfolk, where she arrived on 30 November. She underwent a brief period of repairs, then sailed on 17 December for the South Pacific. 1943-1944 Algorab reached Noum√©a, New Caledonia, on 18 January 1943 and discharged her cargo. On 1 February, the ship was reclassified an attack cargo ship and redesignated AKA-8. She spent the period between January and June supporting consolidation operations in the southern Solomon Islands. Algorab made a total of five voyages between New Caledonia, Espiritu Santo, and Guadalcanal or Tulagi. On 30 June, Algorab took part in the landings on Rendova Island. While retiring to Tulagi that afternoon, her convoy was attacked by Japanese torpedo bombers. Her gunners assisted in the destruction of five enemy planes, and the attack cargo ship proceeded to Tulagi. From 1 July to 17 August, she made more voyages carrying troops and equipment between Guadalcanal; Hollandia, New Guinea; New Caledonia; and Espiritu Santo. Algorab sailed for Australia, on 22 August, arrived at Sydney on the 25th, and began repairs to her main engine. On 15 September, the attack cargo ship sailed to Newcastle, Australia, for amphibious warfare training exercises. After they were completed, she sailed to Moreton Bay, Australia, and remained at anchor there until 22 November. On that date, the ship entered drydock at Brisbane for a major overhaul. Algorab got underway for the West Coast on 5 September 1944, under tow and operating on reduced power. She reached San Francisco on 30 September for major engine repairs and hull alterations at the Moore Dry Dock Company, Oakland, California. 1945 She left drydock on 30 January 1945 and, following engine trials, sailed on 5 February en route to Leyte, Philippines. The ship paused at Eniwetok to join a convoy; put in at Leyte on 4 March; and, upon her arrival, began onloading ammunition, vehicles, and provisions earmarked for the Ryukyus campaign. Algorab sailed with TransDiv 37 on 27 March, arrived off Okinawa on 1 April, and sent off her boats at 0600. Her cargo was completely unloaded by 9 April, and Algorab sailed that day for Hawaii. She made a brief stop in Saipan, reached Pearl Harbor on 24 April, and underwent another period of engine repairs before the vessel sailed on 10 May for San Francisco. Upon her arrival, on 18 May, Algorab received repairs at the General Engineering & Drydock Co. which continued through October. On 14 October, preparations were begun for deactivation. Algorab was decommissioned on 3 December, and her name was struck from the Navy List on 19 December. Algorab won four battle stars for her World War II service. Return to commercial service Algorab was declared surplus and returned to the Maritime Commission on 30 June 1946 for layup at Suisun Bay awaiting sale. The ship was sold to Wallem & Co. on 4 April 1947 for merchant service and later renamed Kamran, Mongala, and Hellenic Sailor. She was scrapped in 1973.

He is best known as the author of Alei Shur (), a musar classic discussing dimensional growth as it pertains to students of the Talmud. He died in Jerusalem in 2005. Life and teaching positions Shlomo (Wilhelm) Wolbe was born in Berlin to Eugen and Rosa Wolbe. He was raised in a secular Jewish home and received his education at the University of Berlin (1930‚Äì1933). During his university studies he became a baal teshuva through the efforts of the Orthodox Students Union V.A.D. (Vereinigung j√ºdischer Akademiker in Deutschland). After university he attended the Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary. He continued to study at Rabbi Boczko's yeshiva in Montreux, Switzerland. He then attended the Mir yeshiva in Poland, where he became a student of the mashgiach ruchani, Rabbi Yeruchom Levovitz, and, to a lesser extent of Rabbi Yechezkel Levenstein. While in the Mir, Wolbe befriended a young man from Stockholm, Sweden, Bert Lehmann, son of Hans (Chaim) and Fannie Lehmann. During World War II, Wolbe, who was a German national, was in danger of deportation and could not follow the Mir yeshiva into Russia. Hans Lehmann invited Wolbe to stay with his family and be the Jewish teacher for his sons. Wolbe thus was able to spend the war years in neutral Sweden. While he was in Sweden, he functioned there as a rabbi. During the war he worked for the US-based Rescue Committee in coordination with Rabbi Benjamin Jakobson. At the end of the war he created a girls school for refugees in Liding√∂. There, he wrote pamphlets on Judaism in Swedish and German. Wolbe moved to Mandatory Palestine in 1946 and studied at Yeshivas Lomzha in Petah Tikva. He then married Rivka Grodzinski, the daughter of Rabbi Avraham Grodzinski, of the Slabodka yeshiva (Rivka passed away on October 25, 2018),making him brothers-in-law with Hagoan Rabbi Chaim Kreisworth of Belgium. Wolbe continued his studies at Kollel Toras Eretz Yisroel in Petach Tikva under Rabbi Yitzchok Katz. In 1948, Wolbe took over a small yeshiva belonging to a youth organization called Ezra. Two years later, he was joined by Rabbi Moshe Shmuel Shapiro of Brisk. The yeshiva was located in the small town of Be'er Yaakov, and was known as the . Shapiro became the rosh yeshiva and Wolbe became the mashgiach ruchani. For more than 30 years, until 1981, Wolbe served as the menahel ruchani of Yeshivas Be'er Yaakov. Later, he served as mashgiach in the Lakewood Yeshiva in Eretz Yisroel before opening Yeshivas Givat Shaul, a house of learning specializing in mussar. During these post-1981 years, Wolbe gave mussar talks in various yeshivot as well as small groups. He created many \\"mussar houses.\\" The Bais Mussar was named with the support of Manfred Lehmann (son of Hans Lehmann) in memory of Chaim (Jamie) Lehmann, who had died in 1982. Prominent amongst his many students are Rabbi Uri Weisblaum and Rabbi Reuven Leuchter, all of whom have published works of Mussar, as well as Rabbi Benjie Jacoby, who continues to successfully reach out to North American university students, bringing thousands closer to Torah. Views on child education Wolbe opposed hitting children; this, in light of the weakening generations in understanding the biblical verse (Proverbs 13:24) advising \\"spare the rod spoil the child.\\" Known for being a lifelong reader of many disciplines such as secular psychology and educational theory, Wolbe created his own educational philosophy for the greater community. In his important work on education Zeriah u'Binyan beChinnuch (\\"Planting and Building in Education\\") he presents an adaptation and paraphrase of John Dewey's Democracy and Education (1916), in which Dewey presented the tension of rote learning and a democratic individualism. For Wolbe, the educator needs to \\"build\\" the students on the firm ground of Torah, the community, and Haredi yeshiva values, yet at the same time allow the students to \\"grow,\\" each in their own personal and individual way. Wolbe emphasized the great stress Torah places on the individuality of every child and every situation. In his discussion of prayer he states: Mussar approach He published his first volume of Alei Shur in 1966, which contains his mussar (\\"ethics\\") analysis on a proper regimented life of a yeshiva student. The second volume published 20 years after the first was an intense glimpse into his actual mussar workshops for developing elevated character traits. The book contains step by step instructions and specific exercises. Rabbi Wolbe puts much emphasis on Seder or having a schedule in order to fully utilize one's capabilities. He actually devotes a section in each volume of Alei Shur to the topic. Wolbe believed that the student should not rely on habit or emotions, rather they should structure their lives. \\"The greater the person is, the more organized is his life.\\" (Alei Shur, Pg. 68) In Alei Shur volume 2: Mussar chapter 5, he presents the core of his method: The continuous need to better oneself in the everyday. He calls this better of deepening Hislamdus (\\"teaching oneself\\"), a non-ego learning from things. Wolbe's method will slowly train one to contemplate nature, one's surroundings, political events, and one's home life: Wolbe felt that there are four basic areas aside from the regular Gemara curriculum of the yeshiva that the yeshiva student should master. #He must know the Halakha (Jewish law) that affects him through the Mishnah Berurah. #He should know Chumash with the commentaries of Rashi and Ramban as a basis for one's hashkafah. #He should know Pirkei Avos with the commentary of Rabbeinu Yonah (a cousin of Nachmanides) as a basic primer in acceptable character traits (midos). #He should know Mesillat Yesharim (by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto) which he calls \\"the ultimate compendium dictionary for midos.\\" It must constantly be delved into. Political positions His work Ben sheshet le- Asor (\\"Between [the] Sixth [of] to [the] Tenth [of]\\"), now renamed \\"Olam Hayedidus\\" (\\"a world of friendship\\" i.e. between God and mankind) offers his views on the meaning of Jewish politics and changes to Jewish life resulting from the Six-day War until the Yom Kippur War. This book is a collection of lectures and talks he gave to non-religious in Kibbutzim and to soldiers in the IDF. It also contains a selection of opinion letters he wrote regarding contemporary issues in the Jewish world. He kept a distance from Zionism viewing the Charedi community as a continuity of the Old Yishuv. He even quotes Gershom Scholem that Zionism is the direct outgrowth of Sabbatianism to prove his point. In this book he takes issue with the position in the Agudah newspaper Hamodia, that the state of Israel is a vessel for leading a Charedi life. The state of Israel did not contribute to Charedi life. For Wolbe, the state is entirely heretical and even Israel Independence Day should not be recognized. The state gets no credit for providing any Jewish culture since Biblical studies, archaeology, and Jewish history are entirely secular. He states that he agrees with the anti-Zionism of the Satmar Rav, but thinks that it is still permissible to enter the government and to receive money from it.Ben sheshet le-Asor In the post 1967 world, he envisioned that people would become ba'alei teshuva and there would be a great movement in Israel of people returning to their Jewish heritage. Rabbi Wolbe's grandchildren spearhead major American and Israeli Jewish outreach efforts; notably Rabbi Eliezer Wolbe who heads his grandfather's Bais HaMussar and Vaad Chizuk in Jerusalem, Rabbi Aryeh Wolbe of TORCH in Houston, Texas, Rabbi Yaakov Wolbe whose website and classes are a reflection of his grandfather's love and yearning of teaching Torah to the Jewish masses, and Rabbi Yechiel Erlanger of Denver, Colorado.

Neer dosa is a delicacy from Tulu Nadu region, and part of Udupi - Mangalorean cuisine. Overview Neer is the word for water in Tulu language. Unlike other dosas neer dosa is known for its simple preparation method and lack of fermentation. Usually neer dosa is served with coconut chutney, sambar, saagu and non vegetarian curries like chicken, mutton, fish and egg curry.  Ingredients  Even though many variations exist for Neer Dosa batter, the two basic ingredients common to all of them are just soaked rice (or rice flour) and salt.  Preparation  There is no requirement for fermentation of the rice in order to prepare Neer dosa. The rice needs to be soaked for at least 2 hours. After a quick wash and a drain the rice needs to be ground by adding water in order to get very fine batter. Additional amount of water can be added based on the thickness of the batter and then salt is added for taste. Finally the batter is used to prepare the dosa.

The term was coined in 2001 by Dr. Nikhil V. Dhurandhar, at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Bacteria The study of the effect of infectious agents on metabolism is still in its early stages. Gut flora has been shown to differ between lean and obese humans. There is an indication that gut flora in obese and lean individuals can affect the metabolic potential. This apparent alteration of the metabolic potential is believed to confer a greater capacity to harvest energy contributing to obesity. Whether these differences are the direct cause or the result of obesity has yet to be determined unequivocally. A possible mechanistic explanation linking gut flora to obesity involves short chain fatty acids. Humans are unable to digest complex polysaccharides and rely on gut microbiota to ferment these polysaccharides into short chain fatty acids. In contrast to polysaccharides, humans can use short chain fatty acids as a source of energy. In addition, research in rodents has indicated that the abundance of short chain fatty acids in the gut can affect the blood levels of gut hormones such as GLP-1, GLP-2 and peptide YY. These changes in gut hormone levels have shown to affect glucose tolerance, insulin signaling, intestinal barrier function and have led to weight gain in rodents. Dietary diversity is associated in humans and animals with a more healthy gut microbiota, and thus may be necessary for effective long-term health improvement strategies, but is often overlooked in animal studies. Furthermore, administration of antibiotics to rodents alters gut microbiota composition and ensuing changes in gut hormone levels are also detected. These results may provide the mechanistic explanation for the claim that antibiotics can lead to obesity in humans. Yet, whether these findings can be replicated in human studies remains to be seen. Viruses An association between viruses and obesity has been found in humans, as well as a number of different animal species. The amount that these associations may have contributed to the rising rate of obesity is yet to be determined. A fat virus is the popular name for the notion that some forms of obesity in humans and animals have a viral source.

MacPherson moved to Victoria, British Columbia, as a child. He learned piano, clarinet, and alto and tenor saxophones. After moving to Vancouver to continue a commerce degree, he played in bands led by Ray Norris, Dave Robbins, Paul Ruhland, and Doug Parke. He led his own groups and eventually took over the leadership of the Cave supper club band. He took a year's leave in 1958 to study in New York City, adding flute to his list of instruments. He played on the CBC and won a Juno Award for Best Jazz Album in 1983. He was awarded the Order of Canada in 1987. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s MacPherson was a first-call studio player in Vancouver, as well as leading the house band at the Cave supper club. He also taught briefly in the Jazz and Commercial Music department at Vancouver Community College, where his students included future Powder Blues Band baritone saxophonist Gordie Bertram and New Orleans based saxophonist and jazz educator John Doheny. Live at the Planetarium, MacPherson's first album as leader of a small jazz group, was recorded for broadcast on the French-language CBC radio network. He leased the master tapes and released them on his own independent label, West End Records. The album was re-released by Concord Records, and MacPherson went on to record several other releases for them. He also recorded for Sackville Records in Toronto and Justin Time Records in Montreal. In the summer of 1993, Pacific Music Industry Association (PMIA) created the Fraser MacPherson Scholarship Fund which annually awards grants of $2000 to four to eight aspiring music students.

Built in 1870, it was located on the site of the former Camp Allen, a Union Army base during the civil war, north of what is now Camp Allen Park, and named for Kekionga, the former capital of the Miami tribe which was located at the site of modern Fort Wayne. The precise size and orientation of the Kekionga Ball Grounds is lost, but it was in area on the left bank of the St. Marys River now bounded by Mechanics Street, Elm Street, Cherry Street, Camp Allen Drive, and Fair Street. The first National Association game was played at the Kekionga Ball Grounds on May 4, 1871. This was the first professional baseball league game, the first professional league game in any sport in America, and possibly the first game of Major League Baseball (if one credits the National Association as a major league, which some people do and some don't). The Fort Wayne Kekiongas defeated Cleveland by a score of 2-0. Bobby Mathews pitched the shutout for the Kekiongas; the umpire was John Boake. A monument to this first game was placed in 2017. At the time of the 1871 game, a covered grandstand called the \\"Grand Dutchess\\" provided spectator accommodations. The Grand Dutchess was open only to women and men accompanying them. (Some sources give \\"Grand Duchess\\" as the name of the ballfield itself, but contemporary records contradict this.) The Grand Duchess burned to the ground on November 5, 1871. The Kekiongas folded before the end of the 1871 season, so the Kekionga Ball Grounds only hosted eight other major league games. League Park A monument at Headwaters Park on the right bank of the St. Marys River (), says that the first major league game was played there, at League Park ballfield. However, the Kekiongas never played at League Park, and the historic marker is incorrect. But two major league games were played there, in 1902. The Cleveland Bronchos played two Sunday home games there, because Sunday baseball was outlawed in Cleveland (it was in Fort Wayne also, but the ordinance was not enforced). Addie Joss pitched the Bronchos to a 6-4 victory on Sunday, June 22, 1902, and Cy Young and the Boston Americans beat the Bronchos 3-1 on Sunday, August 31, 1902. These were the last major league games played in Fort Wayne. Hamilton Field Allen Hamilton and his heirs owned fields in downtown Fort Wayne, on which at various times amateur baseball games and practices were conducted, beginning in 1862. The precise location of the ballfield on Hamilton's fields is lost, but it was in an area now bounded by Calhoun, Wallace, Barr, and Williams Streets, south of the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne, and Chicago Railroad tracks. Teams that played on Hamilton's property included the Kekiongas, in their amateur days. Due to various confusions and flaws in the historical records, some sources give \\"Hamilton Field\\" ‚Äì located north of the train tracks, at the corner of Lewis and Calhoun streets ‚Äì as the location of the first major league game. But it wasn't, nor was there likely ever any place called \\"Hamilton Field\\" as a proper noun. Swinney Park One other major league baseball game was played in Fort Wayne: on October 24, 1882, Chicago defeated Providence 19-7 in the deciding game of the National League postseason series. This game was played at Swinney Park, which was probably located about where the Swinney Tennis Center is now ().

She was the first recipient of the Women's Award for exceptional national service. She is the last living leader of the Women's March.  Early life  Sophia Theresa Williams-De Bruyn was born in Villageboard, an area that was home to people of many different nationalities. She was the child of Frances Elizabeth and Henry Ernest Williams. She says that her mother's compassion for others helped her develop a sense of empathy. When her father joined the army to fight in World War II, Sophia‚Äôs mother moved the family to a new housing development, specifically built for coloureds, called Schauder. She continued her education at Saint James Catholic School. She dropped out of school and started working in the textile industry. Workers in the Van Lane Textile factory asked her to help \\"solve their problems with factory bosses,\\" and she eventually became the shop steward. She later became an executive member of the Textile Workers Union in Port Elizabeth. Political career Williams-De Bruyn was a founding member of the South African Congress of Trade Unions (SACTU). After the government introduced the Population Registration Act in the 1950s, she was appointed as a full-time organizer of the Coloured People's Congress in Johannesburg.

It is situated in the Swaythling district of Southampton, approximately one mile north-east of the University campus in Highfield. The complex is formed of South Stoneham House, Connaught Hall and Montefiore House. There are over 1800 undergraduate and postgraduate students living in Wessex Lane Halls. University of Southampton students living in Halls are supported by the Residences Support Service,. Accessed: 25 September 2012. who are available throughout the night.

The bars are run by the students union. The complex is served by excellent transport links, with regular Unilink buses heading north to Southampton Airport (and Eastleigh at peak times) and south to Southampton City Centre and hourly trains from nearby Swaythling railway station. South Stoneham House The 17 storey extension to South Stoneham House. South Stoneham House. South Stoneham House was acquired, with South Hill (situated some two miles northwest of Wessex Lane), in 1920 to house male students at University College Southampton. It was originally the manor house of the Parish of South Stoneham, which stretched along the River Itchen from the Bargate in Southampton City Centre to Eastleigh. The house itself was constructed in 1708, as the family home of Edmund Dummer, the former Surveyor of the Navy, and has been attributed to Nicholas Hawksmoor, while its gardens were laid out after 1722 by Capability BrownThe Times, 13 June 1804 (though very little of the original landscaping remains). Tradition prevailed in the house, with a collegiate atmosphere as gowns were expected to be worn to dinner and lectures and curfews were enforced. By 1924, there was distinct pressure on space in the halls of residence, and it was clear that more rooms were needed. The existing halls were full and so South Stoneham and South Hill were extended by covering their outbuildings. During the Second World War, the Highfield location of the College meant it was directly in the war zone itself. With Southampton being attacked, the halls of residence were also under siege: at South Stoneham windows were blown in by bombs. For much of this time, the College operated a School of Navigation, based in the communal rooms of Stoneham House. In 1964, a concrete tower extension was added to the hall, incorporating a bar and dining hall area, both now out of use. The extension was designed as a stop- gap measure until the full development of the Montefiore and Glen Eyre sites could be pushed through, with an anticipated lifespan of just 15 years. Over four decades on, the tower was only finally removed from the University's housing stock in 2012. South Stoneham has 180 rooms over its 17 floors (16 of which are residential), although it is all closed to the public. For the majority of Stoneham's existence as a residence, students were fully catered for in the building's own canteen and dining hall. In latter years, as the building's use was wound down, residents were part-catered for and ate in Connaught's Galley Restaurant. Residents shared small kitchen and bathroom facilities. Much controversy had surrounded the continuous use of South Stoneham Tower and in 1997 a large wooden collar was added to the base of the tower to prevent crumbling concrete falling onto staff and students below. As the tower was originally built using asbestos, its decommission and deconstruction has provided a technical stumbling block to redevelopment of the South Stoneham site. Physical disassembly would be hugely expensive, while explosives cannot be used due to the proximity of private houses and the Grade II listedSouthampton City Council: Listed buildings in Southampton Accessed 17 September 2007.

Connaught Hall Connaught Hall bottom right, Montefiore House top left. Connaught Hall is one of the University's original halls of residence, purpose built in 1931 for what was then the Hartley Institution. That original building, now known as the \\"Old Quad\\", was added to in 1964 (the same year the dining hall, kitchens and 17-storey tower were added to South Stoneham House) forming the \\"New Quad\\" and bringing the number of rooms to 315. Today the accommodation is primarily used by first year undergraduate students who live in the hall for one year only, but originally it was open to a wider range of University members; for example a professor of mathematics, Harold Ruse, lived in Connaught for nine years, from 1937 to 1946. The two \\"quads\\" consist of blocks of rooms arranged into squares with scenic gardens in the centres. The Old Quad is of traditional design in the neo-Georgian architecture style and contains study bedrooms grouped around staircases and most of the communal JCR facilities. The New Quad contains the reception area and main building, the Galley Restaurant and the majority of study bedrooms. The Hall is set in a wooded grounds overlooking Monks Brook. Facilities on offer within Connaught in addition to those at Montefiore halls include a large common room (larger than that at Glen Eyre), the largest ratio of space to number of residents within the University, computer room, library, music room, snooker room, a restaurant which provides part-catering for residents, gym, TV room, bar, BBQ area and laundry room. Montefiore Houses Montefiore House 3 disabled access. Around 1925 Mrs Montefiore, wife of Claude Montefiore, purchased a piece of land opposite South Stoneham House, and gave it to the House for a playing field. Claude Montefiore paid for a pavilion to be constructed on the land. Montefiore House (often referred to as 'Monte') as a hall of residence was opened in 1966, built on the grounds of the sports field. Montefiore halls are a self-catered residence. These original structures are now known as Montefiore A and B, and house approximately three hundred first year students in study bedrooms on individual corridor flats, with shared kitchens and other facilities, ranged over 5 floors. Montefiore B is the largest structure. Two flats are situated on each floor, separated into two sides 'Road end' (facing Wessex Lane) and 'Rail end' (facing the railway track). There are 21 students to each flat, except for the ground floor, where administrative staff offices and server equipment occupy some space. This has been met with criticism, kitchens are often very crowded where 21 students must share a single kitchen. Over the next few decades two other developments took place which replaced the old playing fields with the largest student residential centre in Southampton. Montefiore 2 was built in 1977 and consists of self-contained flats housing 400 students in flats of seven rooms each with their own study bedroom. Montefiore 3, the largest of the Monte groupings, was opened in September 1993 and houses some 600 students grouped in flats of seven each occupying a study bedroom with en-suite facilities. This addition made Monte the largest hall of residence in Europe (in terms of the number of students that can be accommodated) at the time. Although generally well built, sound insulation was left out, and noise has been an inevitable problem. Recently Montefiore 4 was added (replacing the link corridor and management offices between A and B blocks) which brings an additional 150 en-suite rooms, and disabled facilities to the complex. The site overall comprises residential buildings: * Block A * Block B * Block C * Block D * Block E * Block F * Block G * Block H * Block J * Block K * Block L * Block M * Block N * Block P * Block Q * Block R * Block S * Block T * Block V * Block W * Block X It also has a reception that was refurbished in the 2017-2018 academic year , and the Boiler House Bar which used to be a popular student bar, but now has lost this function.

Ground was broken on September 21, 1965, in a ceremony that featured President Eisenhower and his good friend, Bob Hope. The college's first class entered in September 1968. It was a liberal arts college. Private funds and two federal grants totaling $14.5 million helped established the college. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of each Eisenhower Dollar coin went to the college. This amounted to some $9 million between the coin's initial production in 1971 and 1978, when production ceased. Eisenhower curricula were centered on a core set of courses collectively known as \\"World Studies.\\" These mandatory courses examined the history of civilization from the ascent of Man through modern times in music, art, history, science, philosophy and literature. Foreign language and physical education courses were also mandatory. Until 1979, the campus housed the National Women's Hall of Fame. History In March 1979, the liberal arts college, which had a total enrollment of only 460 students and was experiencing financial difficulties, was acquired by Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). RIT operated the college for three academic years. Then on July 22, 1982, RIT announced the immediate closing of Eisenhower College due to \\"major operating deficits.\\" Current students and faculty were given the opportunity to transfer to RIT's main campus for the 1982‚Äì83 school year. In 1979 when the merger had taken place, RIT had pledged to operate Eisenhower for at least five years. As a result, there were eventually unsuccessful lawsuits by the school's alumni and by the local organizations which had played a key role in the college's founding. RIT made several efforts to sell the campus, including a proposal to turn it into a state prison. Hundreds of local residents appeared at events opposing the prison plan, and New York State agreed not to go forward with the plan. RIT eventually deeded the campus to the U.S. Department of Education, which had provided construction loans. In 1989, the property was sold to the New York Chiropractic College which continues to operate on the campus. An archive of Eisenhower College material, donated by former professors and alumni, was stored at the campus library as of 2006.

It covers an area of and had a population of 866 in 365 households as of the 2001 census, the population increasing to 892 at the 2011 census. History The parish church, dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin, which gives the village the St Mary in its name, is believed to date from around 1258. The parish church is of flint construction with parts that date back to the thirteenth century. Older maps and documents name the parish or village \\"Pulham Saint Mary the Virgin\\" - the latter two words are in modern times dropped, and Saint is typically abbreviated. The neighbouring parish and village, now called Pulham Market, was historically known as \\"Pulham Saint Mary Magdalene\\" after the dedication of its parish church. The earliest recorded spelling is Polleham. Pulham is referenced in the Domesday Book as a single manor (Pulham St Mary with what is today called Pulham Market) and being part of the Earsham hundred. The name Pulham is thought to mean the farmhouse, homestead or enclosure by the pool, water meadow or stream. There is a 'beck' (Norfolk dialect for a small watercourse) that flows by both villages. In modern times the two villages of Pulham St Mary and Pulham Market are often together described as The Pulhams, including on road signs in the surrounding areas. The Romans may have had a settlement in Pulham St Mary as pieces of Roman tile, coin and oyster shells have been found in the area. The village was well known in medieval times as a centre for hat-making, and the ancient Guild of St James the Lesser established the Guild Chapel, now forming part of The Pennoyer Centre. The nearest railway station is Diss. Until its closure in 1953, Pulham St Mary railway station was a stop on the Waveney Valley Line; the station has since been demolished and the railway has been lifted. The village was struck by an F0/T1 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.http://www.eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi Another tornado had earlier struck Pulham Market. RNAS Pulham and the \\"Pulham Pigs\\" The village sign depicts an airship. In 1912 under conditions of secrecy a large base, RNAS Pulham, was constructed for the operation of airships. The airships were locally given the nickname of \\"Pulham Pigs\\". RNAS Pulham operated as a Royal Navy base until 1918 when it was transferred to the new Royal Air Force. In 1917 two large steel-framed sheds were erected and in 1919 a -high mooring mast joined them. Following its historic both-way Atlantic crossing the R34 returned to Pulham. The large rigid airships R33, R36 and R38 also visited. The base's airship hangar was dismantled in 1928 and re-erected at Cardington. In the early 1920s a radio direction finding station was located there that helped give accurate position reports for aircraft flying to Croydon airport. The base became disused in the early 1930s after the crash of the R101 when all work stopped in Britain on airships, although it continued as an RAF property until 1958. During World War II it was a dump for crashed aircraft from all over the east of England; parts were salvaged for reuse. Munitions testing was also conducted on the site. The Pennoyer Centre In 1670 William Pennoyer, a puritan merchant, left money to pay for a schoolmaster to teach poor children in the village. (Pennoyer also left money to establish a scholarship at Harvard University in the USA, which remains in place today.) The Guild Chapel, prior to its recent restoration; the interior is now a conference room. The school was significantly expanded in the Victorian period. When the school finally closed in 1988, it was the longest- running free elementary school in the country. Most primary-age children in the village now attend the school in neighbouring Pulham Market, and a cycle path built for this purpose runs adjacent to the road connecting the two villages. The Victorian frontage of the building concealed a listed medieval Guild Chapel dating from 1401, making it an expensive proposition for renovation and alternative use. Pennoyer's thus lay unused for almost two decades. In 2006, however, the building was entered in the third series of the BBC's Restoration Village programme in an attempt to secure the necessary funds to transform the building into a new village centre. Although Pennoyer's School did not make the final of Restoration Village, the project remained on track, receiving almost ¬£1m in funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund and ¬£210,000 from Norfolk's Investing in Communities programme. Construction work began in February 2009, and The Pennoyer Centre, complete with a 21st Century extension, and new facilities such a cafe and internet suite, opened in July 2010 for education, business, social and recreational use.

The double form of the idiom is still found in parts of the American Southwest as Howdy, howdy. Without regard to etymological beginnings, the word is used as a greeting such as \\"Hello\\" and not, normally, as an inquiry. In the rural Southwestern United States, Howdy is a colloquial contraction of the formal greeting of How do you do?, and as such is considered a formal and acceptable greeting in Idaho, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Arizona, and Texas. Howdy is also the official greeting of Texas A&M; University, though the two are not always automatically associated.

She was the first woman to be nominated for the Court by a democratic government in Argentina, and caused some controversy upon declaring herself an atheist and a supporter of legal abortion. Early life Born in Buenos Aires, Argibay studied at the Law Faculty of the University of Buenos Aires, becoming a lawyer on 11 June 1964. She worked in a number of public judicial offices and taught in several universities, until 1976. On 24 March of that year, a coup d'√©tat started the dictatorship of the National Reorganization Process. The military junta had her arrested, without formal charges, and held her in prison until December. After being released she devoted herself to private law practice. After the return of democratic rule, on 7 June 1984, she was appointed judge in a criminal court in Buenos Aires. She was promoted in 1988 and again in 1993, and finally retired from her post on 1 January 2002. Argibay is a member of the International Association of Penal Law, and a founding member of the International Association of Woman Judges, over which she presided from 1998 to 2000. She also founded the Association of Woman Judges of Argentina. She took part as a judge in the Women‚Äôs International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan‚Äôs Military Sexual Slavery, which gathered in December 2000 to try Japanese military for war crimes, particularly on the issue of \\"comfort women\\". In June 2001 she was appointed ad litem judge at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Nomination to the Supreme Court Argibay was one of the first Justices who entered the Argentine Supreme Court when President N√©stor Kirchner started to push for its renewal. She was proposed by the President, for the consideration of professional circles and of the public at large, on 30 December 2003. The Senate approved her designation on 7 July 2004. She became a member of the Court on 3 February 2005, once she was able to step down from her duties at the ICTY. She was the first woman ever nominated by a democratic government for a post of the highest court of law of Argentina (Elena Highton, the second, was nominated afterwards, but entered the Court earlier). Argibay's nomination met resistance from some sectors of society, particularly conservative sectors of the Roman Catholic Church, after she went on record stating that she was (politically) \\"more left than right\\", a \\"militant atheist\\", and supported \\"the right of women to decide about their own bodies\\". Most Argentinians are religious, and 85% are nominally Roman Catholic; abortion is illegal in Argentina in most cases. When the nomination was made public, a number of conservative voices criticized her for her atheism and her stance on abortion; a Catholic organization complained that Argibay, who is single and childless, was \\"not representative of Argentine women.\\" To these criticisms, Argibay replied, \\"I believe that saying up front who one is or what one thinks is an indication of honesty, which is the first step towards impartiality. My beliefs, or lack thereof, should not interfere in the judicial decisions I take.\\" Argibay was awarded the 2007 Gruber Prize for Justice (shared with Chilean judge Carlos Cerda and Peruvian lawyer M√≥nica Feria Tinta) for her promotion of gender equality and eliminating corruption within the justice system.2007 Gruber Prize for Justice She died on 10 May 2014 after suffering respiratory, cardiac and intestinal problems.Muri√≥ Carmen Argibay Death of Justice Carmen Argibay leaves top court with six members Notes References * IPS News.

It enters from Illinois at Beloit, and runs north to its northern terminus in Hurley where it meets US 2. Much of the route of US 51 runs concurrently with Interstate 39 (I-39). Route description From Beloit, US 51 passes through Janesville and Edgerton. US 51 joins with I-39 and I-90 for about before splitting off and heading west to Stoughton. US 51 then passes through the east side of Madison as a side route, known locally as Stoughton Road, paralleling to the west of I-39/I-90. North of Madison, US 51 parallels the Interstates on the east side passing through De Forest, Leeds, North Leeds, Poynette and Portage. In North Leeds, US 51 has a major junction with Wisconsin Highway 22 (WIS 22) and WIS 60 where US 51 heads west a bit with WIS 60 before splitting back north toward Poynette. The route joins I-39 north of Portage. There is a short concurrency with WIS 23 from Endeavor to WIS 82 near Oxford. They stay joined until I-39 ends at WIS 29\\\\. Along the way, the route bypasses the small communities of Endeavor, Packwaukee, Westfield, Coloma, Hancock, Plainfield, Plover, and Whiting prior to arriving at Stevens Point. Proceeding north from Stevens Point, the highway bypasses Knowlton, Mosinee, and Rothschild where I-39 terminates at the WIS 29 east interchange. US 51 continues on with WIS 29 for bypassing Schofield, then proceeding into Wausau where WIS 29 splits to the west. US 51 continues as a freeway to Merrill, passing Brokaw along the way. US 51, along with I-39, in northern Wisconsin The section of US 51 from Portage at its junction with I-39 to Merrill, as well as from County Trunk Highway S (CTH-S) to US 8 in Tomahawk, is built to Interstate Highway standards. In between these freeway segments exists an expressway from Lincoln Drive north of Merrill further north to CTH-S south of Tomahawk with five grade-level intersections. This will eventually be converted to a freeway, making US 51 a continuous freeway from Portage to Tomahawk. The highway becomes a two-lane road just north of US 8 at the Oneida County line. The highway passes through Minocqua, Manitowish Waters, and Mercer on its northwest trek toward Hurley and its terminus at a junction with US 2. History US 51's northern terminus at US 2 near Hurley Prior to 1926, what is now US 51 was State Trunk Highway 10. US 51 was upgraded to a full freeway over a period of 25 years from Merrill to Portage. The freeway continues around Portage to the west as I-39 (originally as WIS 78) to connect with I-90 and I-94 while US 51 continues along surface roads into and through Portage. In the 1990s, US 51 was designated as I-39 from its junction with WIS 29 eastbound in Wausau to where it left the freeway at exit 92 in Portage. US 51 remained cosigned with I-39 along this entire stretch of road. Further expansion of the highway northward took place in 2000, when the highway was upgraded to an expressway up to CTH-S. In addition, a super-two freeway from CTH-S to US 8 was upgraded to a four-lane freeway. The Wisconsin mileage of US 51 is designated by the state as the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway.

History The company was established in Halifax, Nova Scotia by industrialist (Fred C Manning?) Roy Jodrey on 1 August 1938 as Nova Scotia Coach Lines, a division of United Service Corporation. In 1947, it became known as Acadian Lines and on 28 December 1955, Acadian Lines became a wholly owned company when it was purchased from United Service Corporation by George C. Thompson, Ralph A. Pepper, and Gordon H. Thompson. The company subsequently purchased the bus operations of Fleetlines Limited of Halifax and Highland Lines of Sydney. Acadian Lines operated regular passenger and parcel express services between communities throughout the province. Acadian Lines was Nova Scotian-owned until December 1995, when the Irving Transportation Group purchased Acadian Lines and merged SMT (Eastern), an Irving subsidiary which operated scheduled and chartered bus services in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, with Acadian Lines while maintaining and expanding the Acadian name throughout the Maritimes.Acadian Lines Archives Canada In 2004, Irving Transportation Group sold Acadian Lines to Keolis which brought it under the control of its Orl√©ans Express subsidiary. Orl√©ans Express modified the company logo to include an upside-down \\"a\\" for the third \\"a\\" (thus becoming Acadi…ên); the legal company name remains spelled \\"Acadian\\" for correspondence. Effectively, this made the logo a bilingual ambigram, as the \\"…ê\\" could either stand for \\"a\\" (English), or \\"e\\" (French). Former operations Acadian Lines operated regular bus services between New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia as well as Rivi√®re-du-Loup, and Quebec (connecting with Orl√©ans Express). In 2006, Acadian Lines cancelled bus service on the route between Halifax and Yarmouth due to low ticket sales. In 2011, Acadian Lines cancelled bus service on the route between Saint John, New Brunswick and Bangor, Maine due to low ticket sales.Gowan, Derwin (17 March 2010). Login required. Telegraph Journal. Retrieved 20 August 2011 From 2 December 2011 until 16 May 2012 the company completely shut down its New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island operations after it locked out 59 drivers with Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1229 over a contract dispute. Although Acadian Lines operations in Nova Scotia continued to function, the lack of service in New Brunswick meant that inter-city bus service from Nova Scotia to central Canada was interrupted during this time. Service restarted in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island on 16 May serving a limited route network. Routes north of Moncton, New Brunswick to Campbellton, New Brunswick as well as from Saint John, New Brunswick to Fredericton, New Brunswick were reduced or eliminated. Additional buses on existing routes to Prince Edward Island were eliminated. Acadian Lines ceased operations in all three provinces on 30 November 2012, citing financial losses due to regulatory inflexibility for routes. Legal status The company was incorporated as Acadian Coach Lines LP/Autocars Acadien SEC in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.

Because of union rules, most of the English voice cast for the first season were credited under pseudonyms; the only ones who used their real names were Lia Sargent (R. Dorothy Wayneright), Wendee Lee (Angel), Michael McConnohie (Schwarzwald) and William Frederick Knight (Gordon Rosewater). Main characters Roger Smith is the series protagonist. He is the . His job entails finding a resolution for the troubles of Paradigm City, the \\"City of Amnesia\\". He'd negotiate anything for anyone, but he is a professional and expects the parties to behave professionally.Roger Smith (voice-over): Negotiating requires good faith. In this case, it was lacking on both sides. Collective bargaining of this nature should only be conducted between pros. (Act:01, \\"Roger the Negotiator\\") Despite this, he displays a certain aversion to the Paradigm Corporation, and takes the jobs he gets from them only if they happen to involve a threat to the city itself or are of personal interest to him. When memories betray the people and force them to reawaken monstrosities of the city's past, Roger's only option is to fight back with a monstrosity of his own, the black megadeus Big O.Roger Smith (voice-over): My name is Roger Smith. My other name is Negotiator, a much-needed job which I perform here in Paradigm City, \\"City of Amnesia.\\" What I thought was a routine negotiating assignment for a simple kidnapping case exploded into an ugly ordeal. At times like that, I rise to the occasion in Big O. (Act:02) The character, originally envisioned as a private eye, shows influences from Batman, James Bond and Daisaku Kusama from Giant Robo.The Toonami promo calls Roger Smith \\"One part Batman, one part Bond, one part giant city-smashing robot.\\" It is available for download at Toonami Digital Arsenal. ;Creation and Characterization In 1996, Keichii Sato and Kazuyoshi Katayama began work on what would become The Big O. Looking to create something distinguishable from the Gundam franchise, they used as a basis old super robot series and American TV shows. Sato's original concept was a giant city-smashing robot piloted by a man in black, Roger Smith. Inspired by detective shows like Oretachi wa Tenshi da! (We Are Angels!) and Tantei Monogatari (Detective Story), Roger was to be a private eye.\\"Birth of the Big O \\". The Big O DVD Volume 1. Bandai Entertainment. However, the creators thought this to be too ordinary, and turned him into a Negotiator. With a negotiator, it would be \\"made sure the negotiations never work out... so, it's guaranteed the robot always trashes the place!\\" However, as the series progresses, most of his cases either require an investigation before actual negotiations can proceed, or they coincide with a police investigation. Thus, he ends up doing considerably more detective work than negotiating. Also, as the series progresses, the sort of stand-alone episodic casework is dropped in favor of an overarching theme (uncovering the truth of \\"The Event\\"). This ends up causing many of his issues to not involve clients at all, but to become personal investigations on his part. Contrary to other robot shows, the protagonist is not a young boy but a \\"cool adult\\". Sato's reasoning behind the decision is he wanted to give young viewers someone to look up to, and older viewers someone to identify with.Shimura, Shinichi. (2004). Anime rebel with a cause: The Big O's Keiichi Sato. AnimePlay, 5, 22-26. In terms of personality, he starts off the series as a very arrogant, witty, sarcastic, and seemingly unconcerned individual to the point of being almost snide. In situations involving his work however, he is professional to the extreme, masking any hint of potentially emotional behavior. He values logic above almost all other qualities, and hates to feel out of control of either his emotions or whatever situation he is in. Thus, during negotiations, he maintains as best he can a calm, collected and pleasant attitude. As the series progresses however, many of these traits are ironed out of his character, and he begins to exhibit a much more compassionate and open-minded attitude, learning how to cope with emotional issues and people instead of just ignoring them. Some interesting incongruities pop up about his character as the story progresses. It is implied by Gordon Rosewater that Roger was alive before the Event and was not one of Gordon's genetically created children. Both he and Gordon refer to Roger having \\"lost memories\\" even though he appears to be in his mid twenties. Gordon specifically mentions a contract that he made with Roger prior to the Event. His flashbacks and hallucinations during the series would seem to indicate that he was a member of the military before the Event occurred, apparently holding the rank of Major, and was Big O's pilot even then. These flashbacks also seem to support Gordon's position that Roger was indeed alive prior to the Event, and a photograph taken of Roger and a younger Gordon seem also to lend credence to the theory. ;Roger's Rules The Negotiator is portrayed as very methodical and strict. He has a number of rules and policies that dictate all aspects of his everyday life; from how people must behave in his house to the way he performs his job: :* \\"I have a special house rule that only lovely young women can unconditionally enter this mansion.\\" (Act:01) :* \\"If you stay [in my house], then you wear black.\\" (Act:02) :* \\"It's not my style to carry a gun.\\" (Act:03) :* \\"I value women and the elderly. It's one of my policies.\\" (Act:05) :* \\"If someone lacks courtesy and sincerity, I ask them to leave.\\" (Act:05) :* \\"The most important rule of all is under no circumstances must anyone touch my desk!\\" (Act:08) :* \\"The basic rule of negotiating is to consider and respect the other person's feelings.\\" (Act:08) :* \\"If you want to live a happy life in this city, leave memories alone when they pop up. That's Roger Smith's Rule No. 1.\\" (Act:11) :* \\"You have to use your pent-up energy to fight through the harshness of reality. That's Roger Smith's Rule No. 2.\\" (Act:11) :* \\"A Negotiator only uses force as a last resort.\\" (Act:18) :* \\"Something else that goes against my policies--using violence against women.\\" (Act:25) ;Tools of the trade The Griffon Roger's wristwatch Roger considers side arms unbecoming a gentleman, (though he has used them as tools, rather than weapons, on occasion) so he avails himself of a number of gadgets to aid his job.Angel (hands Roger a gun): Try this! // Roger Smith (under heavy-fire): Goes against my principles... but I don't have a choice! // Angel (after Roger shoots the water pipes behind the soldiers): So no matter what, you won't shoot people? // Roger: It's all part of being a gentleman. (Act:08, \\"Missing Cat\\") Inspirations for the equipment include characters such as Batman, James Bond and Dick Tracy; and shows like Thunderbirds, Giant Robo, and The Avengers. Roger's vehicle of choice is the , a black luxury sedan comparable to the Batmobile and James Bond's Aston Martin. The car comes equipped with armor for the wheels and windows, missile launchers, a communications station, Browning machine guns behind the front indicators, smart glass camouflage, and a police scanner. The Negotiator's second most important weapon is his wristwatch, the tool for summoning the Big O. By calling the megadeus' name into the watch, Roger informs the giant it is \\"Showtime!\\" and it comes to its master's side.Daisaku Kusama of Giant Robo uses the command \\"Crush them!\\" along with the giant's name to summon it. The watch also works as a remote control to the Griffon and includes a grappling cable, a laser cutter and a two-way communicator. Roger's greatest weapon is the megadeus Big O. A metal behemoth that, unlike the giants of other robot anime, does not exhibit speed nor grace. But what it lacks in agility, it more than makes up for in power: The Big O is equipped with armed missiles, pile-driver powered punches, machine guns and laser cannons. Big O is transported around Paradigm City and out into the country via underground railway tunnels aboard the massive, quad-engine carrier train called the Prairie Dog, which has a telescoping chute that can deploy and recover Big O on the surface. It apparently operates via remote, as Roger's butler Norman deploys it to different parts of the city from the mansion when his master has need of it. When not in use, it rests in an underground railway junction beneath Roger's mansion. In the manga, it is revealed that this transport also carries interchangeable arms for Big O that can be exchanged easily, something that is not shown in the anime. In addition to these tools, Roger has exhibited extraordinary physical conditioning throughout the series, and has been shown many times to be much more physically capable than most humans. Of particular note is his strength; he has been able to carry Dorothy on several occasions, once even holding her while jumping down around 15 feet, while it has been shown that any other character in the series who has attempted to so much as move her can hardly even budge her. Also, during his brief hand-to-hand fight with Alan Gabriel (who has been shown to have superhuman capabilities), he was able to not only hold his own, but floor the cyborg during their initial exchange. This level of physical ability is never explained, but the final episode of the show suggests, in one of several flashbacks that are themselves never explained, that Roger is himself an android not unlike Dorothy, designed for the purpose of piloting Big O. R. Dorothy Wayneright is Roger's personal assistant. Introduced in Act:01 as Dorothy Soldano, daughter of rich scientist Miguel Soldano, she is later revealed to be an android constructed by him. Her actual \\"father\\" would be Timothy Wayneright, the man who commissioned her construction and father of the real and presumably deceased Dorothy Wayneright.Roger Smith (to Dorothy): It was Soldano who raised you, but it was that old man [Wayneright] out there along with his memories who breathed life into you. (Act:02) To show her gratitude, and as a form of payment for Roger's help, she decides to move in with him and help out Norman with the chores.Norman Burg: I'm overjoyed to have her here. She can help me look after you. // Roger Smith: Wait a minute! You mean Dorothy's going to be living with us? // R. Dorothy Wayneright: It's not because I want to. There's nowhere for me to go. Besides, I owe a debt to you. I have no other means of paying the negotiator service you rendered. // (Act:02) In occasional episodes, Dorothy accompanies Roger in his work as a negotiator. Dorothy stands just under 5 feet (150 cm) tall, has red hair, chalk-white skin and much more body weight than her slender appearance reveals (about 130 kg or approximately 287 lbs.). Her dress is a size three and forehead houses an illuminated CD ROM drive, which is loaded from a drawer made to resemble a hair ribbon. While capable of normal human facial expression, in film-noir tradition she typically maintains a pouty contour and a mildly sarcastic personality, described by Angel as being \\"perpetually foul-tempered\\". Her dry wit is best reflected by her catchphrase \\"You're a louse, Roger Smith,\\" her teasing response to Roger's sometimes unreasonable demands. She and Roger maintain playful retorts throughout the series, with Dorothy often going out of her way to irritate Roger or otherwise rattle his cage. Regardless, she has shown hints of romantic feelings towards Smith. Offsetting her straightforward attitude is her general likability; she gets along rather well with virtually everyone, even those with whom she harbors suspicion. From her conversation and behaviour, it is evident that Dorothy has the capacity for human emotions. She has shown genuine fear on a number of occasions, and reveals jealousy toward Angel's relationship with Roger and satisfaction from its failure to become romantic. An annoying habit (at least to Roger) is that she plays the piano loudly when he oversleeps, mostly due to his late nights on the job. Dorothy is quite durable and much stronger than any human, able to punch down a brick wall with one blow or leap several dozen feet into the air. She has amazing balance, as seen during her moments of contemplation while standing precariously on the edge of Roger's balcony. R. Dorothy can run or bicycle at superhuman speed and does not require oxygen to operate. She shows superhuman coordination, performing effortless gymnastics and is able to steer a car with her foot while standing on the hood. That she takes regular meals with Roger indicates she can consume food and beverages, although she admits in episode 11 \\"Daemonseed\\" not being able to taste. Dorothy also seems to have an unexplained connection to Big O itself. In eps. 20 and 21, when Dorothy is nearly destroyed by Alan Gabriel, Big O apparently senses this and shuts down in order to facilitate her rescue by Roger. In the final Act, she activates Big O's Final Stage weapon by plugging herself directly into the megadeus. She shows self-awareness and capacity for learning; throughout the series she exhibits talents at performance singing and virtuoso piano. It's suggested that the show's closing song \\"And Forever\\" is R. Dorothy performing with a male vocalist, who may or may not be Roger. (In episode 8 \\"The Missing Cat\\" she can be heard humming it.) ;Creation and Characterization The character of R. Dorothy Wayneright is a creation of the series head writer, Chiaki J. Konaka. Until Konaka's involvement with the project in 1999, R. Dorothy was only known as \\"the android girl who lives with Roger.\\" Her design was considerably changed and the characterization followed suit. Series creators Keiichi Sato and Kazuyoshi Katayama call her \\"edgy\\" but \\"loveable\\", aiming for a realistic character rather than the idealized portrayal of females that persists in anime. Dorothy shares a similarity in behavior, appearance and speech with the android Lal from the episode \\"The Offspring\\" from the series Star Trek: The Next Generation. The character shares her name with Dorothy Gale of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, a work Konaka references occasionally in his scripts,In Konaka's \\"Walking Together On The Yellow Brick Road\\" play, R. Dorothy is cast in the role of Dorothy Gale. and the \\"R\\" initial is for \\"Robot\\", a naming convention used by Isaac Asimov in his works. Her name may also be a reference to Dorothy Wainwright, a character from the 1980's British sitcom Yes, Prime Minister, of which Konaka is a fan. Norman Burg is Roger's butler. 40 years ago he, along with all of Paradigm, lost all memories, but he wouldn't think twice before going once more unto the breach for his master. Resourceful and talented, he is also caretaker of the Big O robot. Aside from duties befitting a butler of a house, Norman is also a fine chef who makes it a point to keep hot food available for Roger no matter what time his employer's arrival home. Norman is older than Roger and has apparently lost an eye, which he keeps covered with a patch. The butler is a fatherly influence for both Smith and Dorothy, and the first defense of the Smith mansion, capable of using a number of firearms in case of attack, ranging from small handguns to high caliber machine guns. In the opening credits of the show, he's shown effectively handling a chain gun. Norman also displays a tendency to get involved in the relationship between Roger and Dorothy, \\"pushing\\" the two together for sake of the emotional good each does the other. Where Roger drives his limo, Dorothy makes use of a bicycle occasionally, Norman's form of transportation is a motorcycle outfitted with a sidecar, ridden while the butler comically wears a \\"stormtrooper\\" (Stahlhelm) style helmet. Norman is grateful to Roger Smith for providing him a purpose and in return, Roger considers Norman his most trusted and infallible aide de camp. In the Manga, he has a running gag where he will inquire Roger on paying him, but Roger always manages to avoid it. Dan Dastun is the middle-aged Chief of the Military Police, introduced in Act:01. In \\"Winter Night Phantom\\", Roger describes him as \\"a hard-nosed cop [...] completely devoted to the force, and he has more pride in the Military Police than anything else.\\" He continues, \\"Paradigm City needs him as much as it needs [The Negotiator].\\" He is Roger's former commander, but they still maintain contact. Dastun resents having the force called the \\"watchdogs\\" of the Paradigm Corporation, and has expressed his disdain for its executives.Dan Dastun: That board of inquiry can stuff it! Those paper-pushing high-and-mighty desk-jockeys must think we're nothing more than mindless watchdogs! (Act:10, Winter Night Phantom)Dan Dastun: Go to hell! // R. Frederick O'Reilly: Excuse me? // Dastun: You're recording everything I say into your memory, aren't you, Mr. Android? That was for the executive staff who'll be listening! (Act:19) Dastun himself gets a burst of memory in \\"Winter Night Phantom\\", of a movie he saw as a child. In the movie, a police officer is arguing with a woman holding a balloon on a dock, ending with him shooting her. Her dying words are \\"Vous-√™tes si gentil\\"(\\"You are so kind\\"). In the present, Dastun began seeing a woman that looked exactly like the actress from the movie, Sybil Rowan, but not aged a day, roaming Paradigm City setting off explosions as a means of political assassination. This culminated in Dastun shooting her on a pier while she was holding a balloon, living out the scene from the movie. Towards the end of season 2, Dastun sees two children entering a theater to see the movie, the poster of which bills him as appearing, and when he follows to investigate, he finds they are child versions of himself and Sybil Rowan. Dastun's pride as a member of the military police puts him somewhat at odds with Roger after he resigns from the force, and he expresses an extreme amount of irritation every time Big O appears. At first this irritation is passed off as disliking the vigilante nature of the megadeus. However, as the series progresses, he reveals to Roger that his irritation stems from the fact that the military police do not have the ability to protect the city adequately due to frequent megadeus attacks. This requires Big O to step in fairly often to counter these attacks, which Dastun feels robs the military police of purpose. However, he comes to accept this during season two. He is also one of the few characters who know of Roger's affiliation with Big O, and the only such character within the police department. He was revealed to have obtained this knowledge at some point before season two, but is only seen directly discussing it with Roger once. Angel is the beautiful woman Roger encounters throughout the series. Introduced in Act:03 as Casseey Jenkins (according to the business card she gave to Roger), investigator for Paradigm Power Management, then again in Act:04 as Patricia Lovejoy, secretary for the publisher of Paradigm Press. In Act:07, it is revealed that she bears two long scars on her back, giving the impression that she once had wings; hence her name. Originally a recurring character, Angel was given top billing in Season Two.The title sequence for Season Two can be watched here . It is also available for download at Paradigm City. Her role is that of a femme fatale, the woman who deceptively misleads and ensnares the hero or other males in order to gain some end they would not freely help her achieve.Roger Smith: I've seen those curves before. You were just using me, weren't you, Miss Cassey? // Cassey Jenkins: Not bad, Mr. Negotiator. Thanks to you, I was able to find a perfect route. // Roger: I thought I told you I don't take jobs from untrustworthy clients. // Cassey: You've already done what I wanted you to do. And then some. // Roger: So let me take a guess. You're not with Power Management, are you Miss... // Cassey: Call me Angel. // Roger: Well, a fallen angel. (Act:03) Her interactions with Roger eventually force her into a somewhat different role. As the series progresses, she becomes more and more involved with Roger, even forsaking her duties to the union in order to feed him information, betraying them for Roger's sake. However, her relationship with Roger ultimately does not become romantic, as she believes him to be in love with Dorothy and, though he protests it, the opinion is further reinforced by Alan Gabriel's insistence that Roger \\"cares for [Dorothy] more than anyone\\". At the end of the series, she is shown to have some sort of special connection to whatever power controls their world, possibly even being that power herself (though this role is not adequately explained). She is also identified as one Gordon Rosewater's daughter, and is identified as \\"Angel Rosewater\\" in Act:26. At the end of the final Act, a new version of her is seen (along with a new version of Dorothy) standing on the sidewalk as Roger drives to a negotiation. One reviewer calls Angel a ‚ÄúFujiko clone‚Äù with a ‚Äúbody-hugging suit [that] would give Emma Peel a run for her money.‚Äù Antagonists Alex Rosewater is the primary antagonist of the series. He is the chairman of the and the son of Paradigm City's founder. Alex shows great contempt for the poor of Paradigm and the foreigners living in the city; going so far as to appreciate some of the catastrophes that befall the city as they \\"clean up some of that abominable mess\\" (referring to the people outside the domes). For Alex, Paradigm's true citizens are those within the domes. Alex always wears a white suit in direct contrast to Roger Smith's black one. Alex possesses an unquenchable thirst for power, and an \\"ends justify the means\\" philosophy. Despite being more or less the absolute ruler of Paradigm City, Alex harbors dreams of even greater power and will stop at nothing to achieve them. The power that he desires is the power of the megadei, specifically the \\"Big\\" type megadei, as he believes that their pilots are \\"agents of the power of God\\". Alex sees himself as privileged as being the son of Gordon Rosewater, and at times acts as a \\"spoiled child\\", as observed by Vera Ronstadt. Although he appreciates the power of Big Fau, he treats it as his toy, even going so far as to crafting a miniature version of Big Fau to play with as seen in Act 22. As Season 2 goes on, Alex develops a messianic complex, after reconstructing Big Fau and starting to pilot it. Initially, he is rejected by the megadeus as its pilot after using it to easily destroy a Union megadeus. After the Union megadeus was dealt with, Big Fau displayed the message \\"Ye Not\\" as it fired its dorsal beams into the already damaged cityscape. He manages to get it to work properly only after rigging it with Dorothy's memory core, so it is unknown if he is indeed its true pilot. After he enters the megadeus for the second time, his mental state seems to continually degrade much like Schwarzwald's did after coming into contact with Big Duo. During the Union bombardment of Paradigm, he declares that he will create a new world and destroy those who don't deserve to live in his world, specifically the people who live outside the domes and the Union. It is revealed in Act 25 by Big Fau that he is not really Gordon's son but merely one of his many artificial children. As his battle with Roger drags on, Big Fau inserts cables into Alex's back, apparently fusing itself with him. Though half of Big Fau is vaporized by Big O's Final Stage weapon, Alex survives and aims to finish Roger off - however, before he can do so, he is erased by Big Venus. Alan Gabriel is an eccentric psychopath, a cyborg who takes Angel's place as Rosewater's assistant and the Union's liaison in season two. Gabriel's real agenda is somewhat nebulous, though it would appear that he is straddling the fence between the Union and Rosewater, depending on who will give him the opportunity to kill the most people. He seems to have a particularly gruesome hobby of dismantling androids while they still function, as he claims to despise androids, despite being half-mechanical by choice. After attempting to kill Dorothy and subsequently being foiled by Roger, Alan seems to make killing Roger his top priority. Vera Ronstadt , introduced in Act:20, leads agents within Paradigm. Vera made a deal with Alex Rosewater in which the Union would deliver the parts to construct Big Fau for Alex, but he then reneged on the deal and hunted down all of the Union members. Towards the end of season 2 Vera claimed to be Angel's mother, although given that Angel's memories of her mother appear to have been fabricated, Vera may not have been speaking literally. Recurring characters Big Ear is Roger's informant. He hangs around the Speakeasy, always reading the newspaper that is revealed in the finale to record the future. During the final episode, Big Ear is revealed to be an android, with synthetic skin applied over a metallic body, although this is not the case in the manga. His name likely comes from his almost comically large ears, which usually have in ear headphones, presumably to feed information. He also usually wears a kippah. Jason Beck , sometimes referred to as Beck Gold (due to his overall appearance) is introduced as Dorothy's kidnapper in the series premiere. After \\"being humiliated\\" by Roger during the kidnapping case, Beck's further appearances on the show consist of his trying to humiliate Roger back. However, his plans continually degrade from sinister and dangerous to almost comical in nature. As Dorothy puts it \\"You never learn, do you?\\", since he's tried to use her multiple times in the past as a key component to his machines. He also seems to have numerous memories relating to the operations and abilities of the Megadeus, including one pertaining specifically to Roger's identity as the pilot of Big O. Beck becomes Alex Rosewater's agent after Alan Gabriel threatens him with an order of execution, but is unhappy with this situation despite both a successful attack on Roger and a considerable compensation. Thus, he betrays Rosewater and ends up aiding Roger in the final Act by telling Dorothy how to activate Big O's Final Stage. Beck apparently is a satire of manga/anime character Arsene Lupin III, due to his lanky appearance and goofy behavior. Schwarzwald first appears in Act:04, \\"Underground Terror\\". His real name is , a reporter for Paradigm Press.\\"Schwarzwald\\" means \\"Black Forest\\" in German. Some of the stories collected by the Brothers Grimm took place in the Black Forest, named for the lack of light due to the dense vegetation of the forest. As a reporter, Seebach was obsessed with bringing the truth to the people of Paradigm City, but became frustrated as the Paradigm Corporation continually censored his work. Eventually his search for the truth would become an obsession, and Seebach began living a double life. In time he became even more obsessed with his work and cut himself off from human contact, including his wife and children. But Seebach's obsession also resulted with an attempt on his life by Paradigm which disfigured his face. Seebach eventually decided to journey into the underground of Paradigm City, where he encounters a megadeus Archetype, with him running off after Big O's fight with the Archetype. He reappears in Act:12, as the pilot of Big Duo. In Act:17, thousands of copies of Schwarzwald's writings, a prophecy foretelling the coming of the Leviathan, peppered the city. By episode's end, it is revealed Schwarzwald has been dead for a long time. Schwarzwald appears to Big Duo's new pilot, Alan Gabriel, in Act:24. The apparition declares Gabriel not worthy of piloting it and, subsequently, the megadeus kills him. Schwarzwald's final act is a letter delivered to Roger Smith. The contents of the letter are unknown, but may be the monologue on the nature of \\"truth\\" delivered by Schwarzwald in voice over. Roger Smith wondered \\"if [Schwarzwald] was still wandering the city relentlessly in search of his own personal truth, even after his body had perished.\\" In the Manga, his appearance before the accident is revealed. He seemed to be a middle age man with a short beard, dressed in a trench coat and hat. It also reveals the origin to his alias, as it was part of a poem his mother taught him when he was a child. Gordon Rosewater is often credited as the man responsible for the construction of Paradigm City, and the original founder and chairman of the Paradigm Corporation. Gordon's son, Alex Rosewater, took over his father's duties when he retired. Gordon spends much of his time in a private dome of his own, growing tomatoes. Gordon appears to be perfectly content with the uncertainties of the past, much to the dismay of those who come to him for memories, including his own son. While many look to him for answers, Gordon typically appears to be rather senile, or at least very apathetic. However, his odd speeches about his tomatoes appear to actually be a cryptic euphemism to answer the question. Roger Smith has a recurring flashback of a man in a bloodstained surgeon's uniform standing before a group of children, and Roger believes this man to be Gordon Rosewater, implanting memories of the past into a younger generation. Gordon refuses to comment on this accusation directly, but, referring to his tomato crop, states \\"these tomatoes are reproduced synthetically, with only the memories of the sweet flavor from the original. If we keep repeating the process, this fruit will eventually become the real thing.\\" He does not appear to have actually lost any of his memories however, as he has moments of apparently random lucidity throughout the series during which he reveals important clues to the Event. At the end of the series, he apparently regains both his mind and his interest in the city's past, explaining to Roger, Angel, and Vera several important truths about Paradigm and each of their various existences (Roger and Angel not being genetically engineered for example). Minor characters Timothy Wayneright Timothy Wayneright is introduced in Act:02 as R. Dorothy's grandfather, but turns out to be the man who commissioned its construction using his daughter Dorothy's memories. In \\"Negotiations with the Dead\\", it is revealed Wayneright's work was being funded and supported by the Union. In Act:14, Roger sees a young Wayneright walking into the Nightingale club alongside the human Dorothy. R. Instro is an android introduced in Act:06. He is a very gifted concert pianist who gives Dorothy lessons. Instro was constructed by Amadeus, a scientist whose work was bankrolled by Paradigm until he was murdered by his research partner, Gieseng. R. Instro reappears in Act:17, now expressing his skills as an organist in one of Paradigm City's churches. In the manga, he was arrested as a serial killer due to the fact his hands match what an eye witness saw. It later turns out he was innocent and the crimes were being perpetrated by a cyborg who regained his memories.  Sybil Rowan The Winter Night Phantom The name of applies to two different characters in Act:10. * The first is an actress and anti-government activist expelled from the city 30 years before. She starred in Winter Night Phantom, a movie Dastun saw as a child and now remembers as a recurring dream. * The second character is the bomber featured in the episode. She identifies herself as after Rowan's film. Her death at the hands of Dastun parallels that film's ending and it is shown that a young Dastun watched the film with a young girl in the theater, the implication being that she is either a childhood friend or his sister. R.D. Red Destiny , short for , is the titular character of the first-season finale. She is R. Dorothy's \\"evil twin\\", an android of the same make and model. Red is a serial killer who targets foreigners that claim to have memories of forty years prior. Her calling card is a message that reads \\"Cast in the Name of God, Ye not Guilty\\", the same reading on the Megadeuses screens when activated. She is destroyed after Big O mysteriously reactivates and arrives to protect Roger Smith. Though identical to Dorothy physically, Red has a more robotic, computerized voice, and displays psychotic facial expressions as she chases Roger through the subways. The character is seen again, through flashback, during \\"Negotiations With The Dead\\". In Act:25, it is revealed she was activated by Alex Rosewater. Her overall appearance strikingly resembles Little Red Riding Hood. References External links * Big O - Adult Swim. * Character Profiles - Paradigm City.

In English this moniker has been translated as Bikerbank or the Motorcycle Bandit.  Background  Leibowitz was born in Israel to Yehoshua and Dvora Leibowitz, the oldest of three sons. He was born into one of the wealthiest families of industrialists in Israel. He grew up in the Tel Ganim neighborhood of Ramat Gan, attending the local school before being sent to boarding school at the Hadasim youth village, where he studied for a year and a half. Following that, he went through a number of schools, but by the age of 16 stopped his schooling and went to work. In 1970, he began his military service in the Israel Defense Forces. In June 1973 he completed an officer's course at Bahad 1 and became a logistics officer. He was stationed in the south during the Yom Kippur War. During his military service he married Iris, and their son Liel was born. In the late 1970s, he joined the family business, which operated in Israel and the United States, and had homes in Herzliya Pituah and Manhattan. In the late 1980s, he quarreled with his family and left the family business. According to police, he also went into debt, although Leibowitz denies this. He then began his spree of bank robberies.  Bank robberies  Between 1989 and 1990, Leibowitz robbed 21 bank branches, mostly in the Tel Aviv area, stealing around $400,000. His first robbery was at the First International Bank branch in Herzliya Pituah on February 21, 1989. With his identity still unknown, he quickly became Israel's most adulated outlaw. According to Haaretz, he became a folk hero \\"portrayed as part Robin Hood, part sex symbol.\\" It was widely reported that he used a motorcycle to enter and escape banks, and then hid the motorcycle in a truck readied for that purpose in advance. However, Leibowitz claimed that he never actually used a motorcycle, and that it was a media invention. Rather, he committed the robberies while wearing a crash helmet and windbreaker to disguise himself. After each robbery, he casually walked outside and placed the helmet with the windbreaker stuffed into it in a nearby alleyway, then headed back to the bank and slipped into the crowd of curious onlookers who had in the meantime gathered outside the bank before being ordered away by the police. Leibowitz calculated that the police would not expect to find the perpetrator still at the scene of the crime. He would wait until police removed roadblocks set up in the vicinity, retrieve his helmet and windbreaker, and go home with the money tucked in his shirt. Although he would threaten the teller with a pistol, he never harmed anyone during his robberies, and would only fire a single shot into the air. Police launched stakeouts and set up roadblocks in an effort to catch him. Dozens of bikes were questioned, leading many bikers to adorn their motorcycles and helmets with stickers proclaiming \\"I'm not the robber.\\" At least four suspects were detained on suspicion of being the Ofnobank, among them a reserve Israeli Air Force officer, and Leibowitz twice committed robberies while suspects were being held. The Ofnobank was speculated to potentially be a former commando or former policeman. On October 7, 1990, Leibowitz committed his last robbery at the Bank Hapoalim branch in Ramat Gan. That same month, he was arrested near his parents' home outside a bank which he claims he wasn't even planning to rob.  Aftermath  When questioned, Leibowitz admitted to all his bank robberies and cooperated fully with police investigators. A few days after his capture, he returned all the stolen money. His wife Iris divorced him shortly after his arrest. He was sentenced to twenty years in prison, but his sentence was reduced to 14 years upon appeal to the Supreme Court of Israel. The prosecution agreed to this reduction as well. After serving eight years in prison, he was granted a presidential pardon and released. Following his release, he married Yasmin Merhav, whom he had met during a prison furlough, and came to run his own logistics business. In 2018, his son Liel shared his memories of his father and his exploits in a podcast.

It is currently used mostly for sports and is owned by South China Athletic Association (SCAA). Originally designed for football matches and to accommodate 12,000 spectators when it was opened in 1953. History South China Athletic Association (SCAA), under the chairman Lee Hysan, acquired the Crown land land lease of the present site in Caroline Hill in 1927. A clubhouse and spectator stands were built in 1934. During the World War II, the facilities were occupied by the Japanese force. In 1946, South China AA resumed the control of the facilities in the Caroline Hill as well as in King's Park. New four-sized stands were built in 1953. In 1966, a bowling centre was built around the stadium, which was followed by a sports centre (the Low Block) in 1976. Re-developments From the 1980s to circa 2012, three of the four stands of the stadium were demolished for re-development. One side of the stand was re-developed into the Sports Complex (the High Block) and a golf driving range, which the superstructure was completed in 1987. The football pitch also served as the greens. In 1991, a re-development plan of the stadium was announced. The proposed new complex had three stands and a dormitory for footballers, all but one of the stands were demolished afterwards. The land use of dormitory was approved by the regulator in 1998. In 2005, the club attempted to build a hotel on the former site of a stand. However, the application of the change of land use, was rejected by the Town Planning Board. On 25 October 2012, The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust announced that the SCAA's facilities: the football pitch, the remaining football stand and the driving range, would undergo a major redevelopment with funding of HK$126 million from the trust. New or improved facilities will include a third-generation artificial turf pitch with a covered spectator stand. Location The stadium is located on 88 . According to the club, it is located in the Causeway Bay area, however, in government's urban planning zones, it is part of Wong Nai Chung Outline Zoning Plan.

The castle has been used in a number of film productions lately, including Arabela, Fantaghir√≤, and Before the Fall. History Owners Bouzov was established at the turn of the 14th century with the purpose to watch over the trade route from Olomouc to Lo≈°tice. The minor aristocratic B≈Øz of Bludovec family were its first recorded owners from 1317 to 1339.Ehrenberger, Toma≈° The Most Beautiful 88 Castles, pg. 23-24, Kartografie Praha a.s., The castle also takes its name from the family. Ownership of the castles was then changed, and the Lords of Kun≈°t√°t were among the most important medieval owners. According to tradition, the Bouzov castle is often connected with name of the most famous member of this noble dynasty, Ji≈ô√≠ z Podƒõbrady was born in Bouzov in 1420 and was crowned Czech King in 1458. His original title was Ji≈ô√≠ of Kun≈°t√°t and Bouzov. In 1558 the castle burned down, and lost much of its majestic quality. In the course of centuries there were several changes of proprietors; the castle was owned by the lords of Vildenberk, margrave Jo≈°t, the Haugvic and the Pod ≈†tatsk√Ω families, and in 1696 the barony was bought by the grand master of the Teutonic Order, the Rhenish palsgrave Fanciscus Ludovicus. Vildenberks period As various noble families changed possession of Bouzov, in a similar way also its appearance was changed from an early gothic castle to a Renaissance style. In the time of the lords of Bouzov, the castle played mostly a defensive and guarding role. It probably consisted of a tower and rampart and wooden dwelling houses. The Vildenberks built a stony manor on the western side which was taller than the rampart. Already in the 14th century the castle was significantly widened - a settlement with outhouses was constructed with a ditch and circumvallation, rampart with a 200-foot-high (61 m tall) watchtower and a moat wall built around the castle. During the rule of the Kun≈°t√°t family, the manor was fortified with a new connected rampart with two bastions, and the moat wall was rebuilt with five round bastions. Later a round gun-bastion was erected and the tallest watchtower was repaired. From the 15th to 19th century Bouzov at the beginning of the 19th century In 1408 the castle passed into the hands of Viktorin of Bouzov. In 1499 the Haugvics started the construction of a palace on the eastern side and connected the northern and southern dwelling building. In the first half of the 15th century it was converted into a Hussite stronghold, serving as a prison for captured Swedes during the Thirty Years war. In the second half of the 16th century the castle burned out and remained uninhabited. About a hundred years later, the reconstruction of the castle began again with the remodeling of the southern wing. At that time the castle had already lost its defensive function and became an utterly dwelling object. With the arrival of the Teutonic Order, during the 18th century the castle also lost this function. Only the building in the outer settlement remained inhabited, and by the end of the 19th century the ruin of the castle became a tourist goal. Habsburgs period The castle gained today's appearance after massive Neo- gothic reconstruction between 1895 and 1910.Lisa Dunford, Brett Atkinson, Neil Wilson, Czech & Slovak Republics, pg. 274, Lonely Planet (2007), The Grand Master of the Order of the Teutonic Knights from 1799 to 1939, archduke Eugen Habsburg, decided to rebuild it in the Romantic, predominantly Neo-Gothic style, according to the plans of the prominent architects of its time Georg von Hauberrisser (1841‚Äì1922) of the Munich Polytechnic University; he was the author of Munich and Saarbr√ºcken's town-halls, and also very influential as builder of churches like the St. Paul's church in Munich. The alterations were carried out with the intention of making part of the castle open to the public. Bouzov was fitted with modern furnishings and equipment, including running water and central heating. The order was abolished in 1939 and the castle was confiscated by the fascists, occupied and looted by the Nazis during the WW II. The castle was acquired by the Chief of the Gestapo R. Himmler, who forced the Strahov Monastery to sell it to him for one million crowns, as a present to A. Hitler.Los Angeles University of International Relations, World affairs interpreter, vol. 12, pg. 178, University of Southern California (1941) After 1989 the Order of Teutonic Knights expressed an interest in the castle, but their request to have it returned to them has so far been rejected. Description An eight-storey watchtower, high, dominates the complex. The buildings are grouped around it in the form of a horseshoe, and the castle is enhanced by a number of towers, and among other things, bastions, battlements, oriel windows and loopholes. The two long bridges, ending with a short drawbridge, span the deep dry moat around the castle. The knights' hall, armoury, which is in one of the few original rooms with preserved Gothic vaulting, bedrooms of the knights and a neo-gothic chapel with its Gothic altar and tombs occupy the central part of the castle. The valuable furniture comes from the private collection of Eugen von Habsburg and the collection of the Order of the Teutonic Knights. Since 1999 the castle has been a national monument.

He was initially declared the winner of the disputed gubernatorial election of 1899, but the Kentucky General Assembly, dominated by the Democrats, reversed the election results, giving the victory to his Democratic opponent, William Goebel. Thus, Taylor served only 50 days as governor. A poorly educated but politically astute lawyer, Taylor began climbing the political ladder by holding local offices in his native Butler County. Though he was a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, divisions in the majority party resulted in his election as Attorney General of Kentucky on a ticket with the Commonwealth's first Republican governor, William O. Bradley. Four years later, Taylor was elected in 1899 to the governorship. When the General Assembly reversed the election results after a dispute, incensed Republicans armed themselves and descended on Frankfort. Taylor's Democratic opponent, William Goebel, was shot and died after being sworn in on his deathbed. Taylor exhausted his finances in a legal battle with Goebel's running mate J. C. W. Beckham over the governorship. Taylor ultimately lost the battle, and was implicated in Goebel's assassination. He fled to neighboring Indiana. Despite eventually being pardoned for any wrongdoing, he seldom returned to Kentucky. Taylor died in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1928. Early life William Taylor was born October 10, 1853 in a log cabin on the Green River, about five miles from Morgantown, Kentucky.Hughes, p. 54 He was the first child of Sylvester and Mary G. (Moore) Taylor.Klotter, p. 131 He spent his early years working on the family farm, and did not attend school until age fifteen; thereafter, he attended the public schools of Butler County and studied at home.Battle, et al. In 1874, he began teaching, specializing in mathematics, history, and politics. He taught until 1882, and later became a successful attorney, but continued to operate a farm. On February 10, 1878, Taylor married Sara (\\"Sallie\\") Belle Tanner. The couple had nine children, including six daughters and a son that survived infancy. Political career Taylor's political career began in 1878 with an unsuccessful bid to become county clerk of Butler County. In 1880, he was an assistant presidential elector for Greenback candidate James Weaver. Two years later, he was elected county clerk of Butler County. He was the first person in the history of the county to successfully challenge a Democrat for this position.Hughes, p. 55 Taylor became a member of the Republican Party in 1884.NGA Bio In 1886, he was chosen to represent the third district on the Republican state central committee. That same year, the party nominated a full slate of candidates for county offices, including Taylor as the nominee for county judge. In the ensuing elections, the full Republican slate was elected. Taylor was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1888. He was re-elected as county judge in 1890. In 1895, Taylor was elected Attorney General of Kentucky, and served until 1899. During his term, state senator William Goebel proposed an election law that created a state Board of Elections which was empowered to appoint all election officers in every county and certify all election results.Tapp, pp. 370‚Äì371 The board was to be appointed by the General Assembly, and there were no requirements that its composition be bi-partisan. The law was widely seen as a power play by Goebel, designed to ensure Democratic victories in state elections, including Goebel's own anticipated run for governor.Tapp, p. 370 The law passed the General Assembly, but was vetoed by Republican governor William O. Bradley.Tapp, p. 371 The General Assembly promptly overrode the veto. As attorney general, Taylor opined that the bill was unconstitutional.Tapp, p. 373 The measure was adjudicated by the Kentucky Court of Appeals and found to be constitutional. Gubernatorial election of 1899 Bradley's election in 1895 had marked the first time in Kentucky's history that the Commonwealth had elected a Republican governor. Angry Democrats, who had controlled the governorship since the fall of the Whig Party in 1855, sought to regain what they had lost. Bitter divisions in the party led to a contentious convention that nominated William Goebel as the party candidate. A faction of the Democratic Party held a second nominating convention and chose former governor John Y. Brown as their nominee.Powell, p. 74 The Republicans were initially no less divided than the Democrats. Senator William J. Deboe backed Taylor for governor. Governor Bradley backed Judge Clifton J. Pratt of Hopkins County, and the Republicans of Central Kentucky backed state auditor Sam H. Stone. Taylor organized a strong political machine and seemed in a solid position to obtain the nomination. Bradley was incensed that the party would not unite behind his candidate and boycotted the convention. Taylor unsuccessfully tried to woo him back with a promise to make his nephew, Edwin P. Morrow, secretary of state. Because Taylor represented the western part of the state, the so-called \\"lily white\\" branch of the Republican Party, black leaders also threatened not to support him; Taylor responded by hiring one of the black leaders his permanent secretary, and promised to appoint other black leaders to office if he won the election. Seeing that Taylor's nomination was likely, all the other candidates withdrew, and Taylor won the nomination unanimously.Tapp, pp. 425‚Äì426 During the campaign, Taylor was attacked by Democratic opponents because of his party's support from black voters and its ties to big business, including the Louisville and Nashville Railroad.Harrison, p. 870 They also charged that Governor Bradley had run a corrupt administration. Republicans answered with charges of factionalism and use of political machinery by Democrats. In particular, they derided the Goebel Election Law, which Taylor claimed subverted the will of the people.Tapp, p. 432 Ex-Confederates were usually a safe voting bloc for the Democrats, but many of them deserted Goebel because he had, in 1895, while cashing a check, met and quickly shot his main local political opponent, the esteemed banker and former Confederate colonel John Sandford, in what he declared was an act of self-defense, but some see as more of an (illegal) duel, as both fired pistols at each other.Tapp, p. 434John L. Sandford brief biography, accessed 10 March 2017 Sanford, who received a fatal head wound, was a grandson of Revolutionary War General and US Congressman Thomas Sandford. On the other hand, blacks had historically been a safe bloc for the Republicans, but Taylor had alienated many of them by not strongly opposing the Separate Coach Bill, which would have racially segregated railroad facilities.Tapp, p. 435 Goebel also risked losing support to minor party candidates. Besides John Y. Brown, the dissenting Democrats' nominee, the Populist Party nominated a candidate, drawing votes from Goebel's populist base.Tapp, p. 436 To unite his traditional base, Goebel convinced William Jennings Bryan, a hero to most populists and Democrats, to campaign for him. As soon as Bryan finished his tour of the state, Governor Bradley reversed course and began speaking in favor of Taylor.Tapp, p. 437 While Bradley insisted that his motives were to defend his administration, journalist Henry Watterson believed Taylor had promised to support Bradley's senatorial bid if elected. Governorship and later life In the general election, Taylor secured just 2,383 more votes than Goebel.Harrison, p. 870 The Democrat- controlled General Assembly challenged the election results. Under the Goebel Election Law, a three-man Board of Elections (dominated by Democrats) were to review the results and certify the winner in the contest.Tapp, p. 443 Two of the members of the board had openly campaigned for Goebel, and all three owed their appointments to him, but in a surprising decision, the board voted 2‚Äî1 to certify Taylor as the winner. The board claimed that the Goebel Election Law did not give them the power to hear proof of vote fraud or call witnesses, although the wording of their decision implied that they would have invalidated Taylor votes if they had been empowered to do so.Tapp, p. 444 Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899. Days later, the Democratic- dominated General Assembly convened in Frankfort. They claimed the power to decide disputed elections, and formed a partisan commission (ten Democrats and one Republican) to examine the election results.Tapp, p. 445 Fearing Democrats in the Assembly would \\"steal\\" the election, armed men came to Frankfort from various areas of the state, primarily Eastern Kentucky, which was heavily Republican. On January 30, Goebel was shot while entering the state capitol building. Taylor declared a state of emergency and called out the militia. He called a special session of the legislature, holding it in heavily Republican London, Kentucky rather than the capital. Democrats refused to heed the call, and met in Democratic-dominated Louisville instead. They certified the election commission's report that disqualified enough Taylor votes for Goebel to be declared the winner of the election. Shortly after being sworn in as governor, Goebel died from the gunshot wound he had received days earlier.Klotter, pp. 132‚Äì133 With Goebel dead, Democrats and Republicans met jointly and drafted a proposal to bring peace. Under terms of the proposal, Taylor and his lieutenant governor, John Marshall, would step down from their offices and be granted immunity from prosecution in the events surrounding the election and Goebel's assassination. The Goebel Election Law would be repealed, and the militia would disperse from Frankfort. Prominent leaders on both sides signed the agreement, but on February 10, 1900, Taylor announced he would not. The legislature convened on February 19, 1900 and agreed to put the election in the hands of the courts.Tapp, p. 451 On March 10, 1900, the circuit court of Jefferson County upheld the General Assembly's actions that certified Goebel as governor. The case was appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, then the court of last resort in Kentucky. On April 6, 1900, the Court of Appeals ruled 6‚Äî1 that Taylor had been legally unseated. Taylor appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, and on May 21, 1900, the Court refused to hear the case. Only Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan dissented from this refusal. With Taylor's legal options exhausted, Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, ascended to the governorship. During his short term as governor, Taylor had done little beyond making a few appointments and issuing a few pardons.Tapp, p. 451‚Äì453 Taylor was indicted as an accessory in the assassination of Goebel. He fled to Indianapolis, where the governor refused to extradite him. At least one attempt to abduct him by force failed in 1901. Despite being pardoned in 1909 by Republican Governor Augustus E. Willson, Taylor seldom returned to Kentucky.Klotter, p. 133 Financially strapped by the costs of challenging the election, Taylor became an insurance executive and practiced law. Shortly after arriving in Indiana, his wife died. In 1912, he briefly returned to Kentucky to marry Nora A. Myers. The couple returned to Indianapolis and had a son together. Taylor died of heart disease on August 2, 1928, and was buried at the Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis. See also *Taylor v. Beckham References Bibliography  External links Taylor v.

The Duke of Edinburgh is her younger brother. Sophie was born at the villa Mon Repos on the island of Corfu in Greece. Family and youth Sophie's father was the fourth son of King George I of Greece and Grand Duchess Olga Konstantinovna of Russia. Through King George, she was a great-granddaughter of King Christian IX of Denmark (hence her subsidiary title, Princess of Denmark). Through Queen Olga, she was a great-great-granddaughter of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia. Sophie was also a great-great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria, through descent from Victoria's second daughter, Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse. Sophie was the closest sister in age to Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the consort of Elizabeth II. Her three sisters were Margarita, Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (1905‚Äì1981), Theodora, Margravine of Baden and Cecile, Hereditary Grand Duchess of Hesse- Darmstadt. In 1913 Sophie's grandfather, King George I, was assassinated and in 1917 most of the Greek royal family went into exile when her uncle, King Constantine I, was deposed in favour of his younger son, King Alexander I. The family returned to Greece upon the brief restoration of Constantine to the throne when Alexander died in 1920, but left again when he abdicated in 1922, inaugurating the even briefer reign of Constantine's eldest son, George II. Banished with King George in 1924, the Greek monarchy was reinstated in 1935, by which time Sophie had married and was raising a family in Germany. During these periods of exile Sophie, her parents, and siblings lived abroad in reduced, though never uncomfortable, circumstances, sometimes in hotels and sometimes with relatives in France, England or Germany. In the late 1920s, her mother, Alice, became increasingly mentally unstable and was committed to a series of sanitariums in Germany by her mother, Princess Victoria of Hesse- Darmstadt, Marchioness of Milford Haven. Eventually released, Alice wandered Europe until, following the death in a plane crash of Sophie's sister, Cecilie, in November 1937, she resumed contact with her children and took up a life dedicated to religious charity in Athens. Meanwhile, Sophie's father remained in contact with his children, but lived apart from them, settling in Monaco. Sophie and her sisters lived under the care and at the expense of relatives, all four princesses marrying German princes between December 1930 and August 1931. Their brother Philip, not yet 10 years old, was sent to various boarding schools and, later, to a British naval academy. First marriage Although the youngest of four sisters, Sophie was the first to wed, marrying her second cousin-once-removed Prince Christoph of Hesse (1901‚Äì1943) on 15 December 1930 in Kronberg, Hesse; she was 16. A younger son of Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse and Princess Margaret of Prussia, Christoph was a great-grandson of Queen Victoria through her eldest daughter Victoria, Princess Royal, wife of Frederick III, German Emperor. A director in the Third Reich's Ministry of Air Forces and a commander in the German Air Reserves, Christoph held the rank of Oberf√ºhrer in the Nazi SS. On 7 October 1943, he was killed in an airplane accident in a war zone of the Apennine mountains near Forl√¨, Italy. His body was found two days later. They had five children: *Princess Christina Margarethe of Hesse (10 January 1933 ‚Äì 22 November 2011), married successively to Prince Andrew of Yugoslavia and Robert Floris van Eyck and had issue *Princess Dorothea of Hesse (24 July 1934 - March 29 2002), married Prince Friedrich Karl of Windisch-Gr√§tz and had issue *Prince Karl of Hesse (26 March 1937) married Countess Yvonne Szap√°ry von Muraszombath, Sz√©chysziget und Szap√°r (b.1944), who is his 5th cousin and had issue *Prince Rainer Christoph Friedrich of Hesse (18 November 1939) *Princess Clarissa Alice of Hesse (6 February 1944), married Jean-Claude Derrien and had issue Second marriage Sophie's second marriage was to Prince George William of Hanover (her second cousin through Christian IX and third cousin through Victoria, having also been a first cousin once removed of Sophie's first husband, Christoph, in descent from Victoria, Princess Royal) on 23 April 1946 in Salem, Baden. George was a younger son of Ernest Augustus III, Duke of Brunswick, who lost his duchy in 1918, and his consort, Princess Viktoria Luise of Prussia, the only daughter of Wilhelm II, German Emperor. Together they had children: *Prince Welf Ernst of Hanover (25 January 1947 ‚Äì 10 January 1981), who married Wilbeke von Gunsteren and had issue *Prince Georg of Hanover (born 9 December 1949), who married Victoria Anne Bee and had issue *Princess Friederike of Hanover (born 15 October 1954), who married Jerry William Cyr and had issue Monarch's consent to marriage withheld Sophie's marriage to George William constitutes the only known case of permission to marry being withheld by the British sovereign from a descendant of King George II, who had been obliged by the Royal Marriages Act 1772 to apply for royal consent to marry.After consultations with the Foreign Office, Home Office and King George VI's private secretary, Sir Alan Lascelles, a ciphered telegram dated 18 April 1946 and composed by Sir Albert Napier, permanent secretary to the Lord Chancellor, was transmitted from the British Foreign Office to the Foreign Adviser to the British Commander in Chief at Berlin: \\"The Duke of Brunswick has formally applied to The King by letter of March 22nd for the consent of His Majesty under the Act 12 Geo. III, cap. 11 to the marriage of his son Prince George William with Princess Sophia Dowager Princess of Hesse. The marriage is understood to be taking place on April 23rd. Please convey to the Duke an informal intimation that in view of the fact that a state of war still exists between Great Britain and Germany, His Majesty is advised that the case is not one in which it is practicable for His consent to be given in the manner contemplated by the Act.\\" The National Archives (UK) LCO 2/3371A: Marriage of Prince George William, son of the Duke of Brunswick, with Princess Sophia, Dowager Princess of Hesse. Request for The King's consent. Although permission to marry had been granted by George VI in 1937 to George William's sister, Frederica of Hanover, future Queen of the Hellenes, when Sophie became engaged to George William, a German citizen, in 1945, the United Kingdom was at war with Germany. When George William's father, Ernest Augustus III, Duke of Brunswick and Head of the House of Hanover, submitted the request to marry on his son's behalf‚Äîa formality his branch of George III's descendants had continued to observe even after obtaining the German crowns of the Kingdom of Hanover (in 1837) and the Duchy of Brunswick (in 1913) Even though the dynastic titles and peerages of the Hanovers had been suspended since 1919, no British monarch had withheld marital authorisation from any kinsman or kinswoman who sought it. Although there was apparently no question of officially denying the request, the British government advised the king that it would be of dubious \\"propriety\\" to give royal assent to his cousin's application. George VI then unsuccessfully sought to have the Hanovers informally advised that the exigencies of war, rather than personal disapproval, prevented him from approving the marriage to Sophie (whose brother, Philip, became informally engaged to the King's elder daughter, after years of courtship, a few months later). Thus, no reply was made to the Duke of Brunswick's correspondence, the couple wed without George VI's consent, and after the war the practice of British monarchs receiving and acquiescing to requests to marry from the Hanovers resumed. At the time British officials reviewing the matter considered that the marriage and its issue would not be legitimate in the United Kingdom, having failed to obtain the prior consent of the King in Council.Eagleston, Arthur J. The Home Office and the Crown. pp. 9‚Äì14. The National Archives (United Kingdom), HO 45/25238, Royal Marriages. The repeal of the Royal Marriage Act as part of implementation of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 does not specifically address the unique position of the descendants of Sophie and George William's marriage (deemed legal in Germany). The 2013 Act does not confer legitimacy upon the children of a marriage which formerly required approval under the Royal Marriage Act, if such approval was sought but not obtained. Nor does it confer succession rights upon a descendant of any marriage which has already transpired, if such rights were not already extant. Later years and death Until her death on 24 November 2001 in Munich, Sophie was a frequent visitor to her brother, Prince Philip and her sister-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II. She was a godmother to their son, Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. Sophie was often seen at events such as the annual Windsor Horse Show in the presence of her brother and his family. She was survived by her second husband, seven of her eight children and her younger brother, Prince Philip.  In popular culture  Sophie features as a (relatively minor) character in the 2009 Belgian pseudo-film noir The Hessen Affair (The Hessen Conspiracy on DVD), the plot of which centres around the theft of her jewels and the entirely fictional post-1871 Imperial German crown jewels from Kronberg Castle.

The founders of the kibbutz were 120 members of two groups: the Nacham group of Polish immigrants who arrived in Eretz Israel in 1947 and underwent training in Kvutzat Kinneret and a group of immigrants from the Habonim movement in Hungary who immigrated through camps in Cyprus and were trained in Kfar Giladi. A Turkish youth group joined the kibbutz three months after their aliya. Over the years until the 1967 Six-Day War, the kibbutz had many confrontations with Syrians across the border, mainly in the period from 1965 to 1967. Among other things, Syrian shepherds crossed the border and grazed with their flocks in the kibbutz fields, and the kibbutz members were frequently fired upon from the Syrian posts in the Golan Heights, while cultivating their fields.http://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=iejHnzpN6aQynKhH3CXszgnwCEsoBxgRVrLty8DQQH1H0ULV9SLhkkBPsV0HlAQPYw%3D%3D&mode;=image&href;=DAV%2f1955%2f12%2f15&page;=1&rtl;=truehttp://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=8jX7rOSTurC%2BXws4EHLQQhzAs%2B%2BaHMbI6qABnOQZcyrPhNpjinXdqkEY5ZX6EcqVYw%3D%3D&mode;=image&href;=DAV%2f1963%2f08%2f14&page;=1&rtl;=true A number of machine operators received the decoration of courage for operating tractors and bulldozers, most of them not armoured, in order to cultivate land and carry out engineering work in the sector of fire, under heavy fire and artillery shelling on the Syrian side.

It has a very low central concentration of stars. This cluster was discovered by James Dunlop on May 28, 1826 and listed it in his 1827 catalogue. He described it as \\"a pretty large pretty bright round nebula, 4‚Ä≤ or 5‚Ä≤ diameter, very gradually condensed towards the centre, easily resolved into stars; the figure is rather irregular, and the stars are considerably scattered on the south\\". The radial velocity of this cluster is unusually high at 490 km/s, larger than any other cluster known. This corresponds to a peculiar velocity of 240 km/s. While high, this is lower than the escape velocity of the Milky Way galaxy. It is located at a distance of 16,300 light years from the Sun and has an estimated 254,000 times the mass of the Sun. This cluster is about 10.24 billion years old. The stellar population of this cluster is inhomogeneous, varying with distance from the core. The effective temperature of the stars shows an increase with greater distance, with the redder and cooler stars tending to be located closer to the core.

Political positions and influence The party represented conservative, nationalist, antisemitic and v√∂lkisch political circles, united in their opposition against the Reichstag Peace Resolution of July 1917. It played a vital role in the emergence of the stab-in-the-back myth and the defamation of certain politicians as the November Criminals. Foundation, leadership and funding Backed by the Pan- German League, the party was founded in September 1917, helped by Heinrich Cla√ü, a founder member. The party's leaders were Wolfgang Kapp (of the Kapp Putsch fame) and Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz (a naval minister and post-war party leader). Walter Nicolai, head of the military secret service, was also supportive.H√∂hne and Zolling, p 290. Media baron Alfred Hugenberg was also a prominent member. The party's political influence peaked in summer 1918 when it had around 1,250,000 members. Its main source of funding was the Third Supreme Command. The party was officially dissolved in the German Revolution on 10 December 1918. Most of its members later joined the German National People's Party (DNVP), the major right-wing party of the Weimar Republic. Subsequent influence One member, Anton Drexler, went on to form a similar organization, the German Workers' Party, which later became the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi Party) that came to national power in January 1933 under Adolf Hitler.

History  ACE Gallery founder Douglas Chrismas opened his own frame shop and gallery in Vancouver at the age of 17. His gallery became known as a venue where Vancouver artists could show alongside major New Yorkers, and get the feeling of belonging to a bigger scene.Roald Nasgaard (2008), Abstract Painting in Canada. In the 60s and early 70s he brought artists such as Robert Rauschenberg, Carl Andre, Sol LeWitt, Bruce Nauman, and Donald Judd to Vancouver, Canada.David Crook (April 15, 1986), Tangled Web Of Art Deals To Be Unwound At Hearing Of Dealer Los Angeles Times. The gallery expanded to Los Angeles in 1967 at the former Virginia Dwan Gallery space in Westwood, and then further expanded to New York in 1994. The galleries were noted for doing museum-level exhibitions by up and coming and internationally renowned artists. While in New York the gallery‚Äôs presence was amplified by doing exhibitions in conjunction with cultural institutions such as the Guggenheim Museum and the Cartier Foundation (Paris). Under Chrismas' directorship, ACE Gallery has had either offices or galleries in art centers outside of the United States, such as Mexico City, Paris, Berlin. and Beijing. In 1972, Chrismas mounted Robert Irwin‚Äôs critically acclaimed installation Room Angle Light Volume at the first ACE/Venice, which opened at 72 Market Street in 1971. In 1977, ACE mounted acclaimed exhibitions of work by Frank Stella and Robert Motherwell, along with Michael Heizer‚Äôs Displaced/Replaced Mass. Installed at ACE/Venice, the Heizer piece required that huge chunks be gouged out of the gallery floor to create recessed areas able to accommodate imposing boulders; the work was considered a triumph for both the artist and dealer. In April 2016, ACE Gallery emerged from a three-year bankruptcy proceeding under the leadership of Sam S. Leslie.Eileen Kinsella, (May 23, 2016), Artnet News. In May 2016, founder Douglas Chrismas was terminated from all roles at the gallery.Jori Finkel, (May 20, 2016), The Art Newspaper.  Controversies  In a 1983 lawsuit in Los Angeles federal court, Rauschenberg sought $500,000 from Chrismas' Flow ACE Gallery; the artist won a $140,000 judgment in the suit in 1984. Eventually the two reconciled their differences and in 1997 Robert Rauschenberg insisted that ACE Gallery New York (in conjunction with the Guggenheim Museum) host his Retrospective.Michael Kimmelman (September 19, 1997), ART REVIEW; Clowning Inventively With Stuff Of Beauty In 1986, Chrismas pleaded no contest after Canadian real estate developer C. Frederick Stimpson alleged that he had improperly sold work belonging to the collector, among them pieces by Andy Warhol and Rauschenberg. Under the terms of the settlement, Chrismas agreed to pay Stimpson $650,000 over a period of five years.David Freed (February 9, 1986), Art Dealer Accused of Cheating Collector of $1.2 Million Los Angeles Times. He continues to work with the Stimpson family in handling their art interests. In 1989, ACE Gallery wanted to borrow a work by Judd along with Carl Andre's 1968 Fall, both owned by Count Giuseppe Panza, for an exhibition devoted to minimal art called The Innovators Entering into the Sculpture. Rather than shipping the two large scale works from Italy, Panza authorized ACE Gallery to refabricate the pieces in Los Angeles. In Panza's collection archives, there is a series of signed certificates signed by Judd that granted Panza broad authority over the works by Judd in his collection.Martha Buskirk (February 2005), The Contingent Object of Contemporary Art . These certificates \\"authorized Panza and followers to reconstruct work for a variety of reasons,\\" as long as instructions and documentation provided by Judd were followed and either he or his estate was notified. This even included the right to make \\"temporary exhibition copies, as long as the temporary copy was destroyed after the exhibition; and the right to recreate the work to save expense and difficulty in transportation as long as the original was then destroyed.\\" Greg Allen (April 27, 2010), Works on Paper Miwon Kwon, in her account of site specificity: \\"One Place After Another,\\" presents the account of ACE Gallery recreating artworks by Donald Judd and Carl Andre without the artist's permission. Andre and Judd both publicly denounced these recreations as \\"a gross falsification\\" and a \\"forgery,\\" in letters to Art in America, however, the fabrication of the pieces were permitted by Panza Collection in Italy, the owner of the works. Despite the confusion surrounding the Panza refabrications, both Carl Andre and Donald Judd maintained a professional relationship with Douglas Chrismas and ACE Gallery. Andre showcased works at ACE Gallery in 1997, 2002, 2007, 2011 and present day. In 2007, Carl Andre's show entitled \\"Zinc\\" was exhibited at ACE Gallery in Beverly Hills. Donald Judd paid a visit to The Innovators Entering into the Sculpture exhibition at ACE Gallery and agreed to keep his sculpture in the exhibition. After the exhibition was over, Chrismas planned to sell the metal used for the re- fabrication of Judd's work for scrap metal but Judd wanted to own the re- fabrication for himself. ACE Gallery then sold the re-fabrication of Donald Judd's work to Donald Judd. After having consigned more than $4 million worth of art to ACE Gallery to sell in 1997 and 1998, the sculptor Jannis Kounellis filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court in 2006, accusing Chrismas of keeping most of the profits of artworks and refusing to return the pieces that did not sell. According to the lawsuit, the primary agreement between Kounellis and Chrismas was oral. Chrismas returned all of Kouenllis' artwork, and did a full accounting of the proceeds from Kounellis' work‚Äîminus the expense of exhibiting it.Jessica Garrison (May 19, 2006), Artist Sues Maverick L.A. Dealer Over Sales Los Angeles Times. The matter was resolved between the two of them and ACE Gallery still sells and exhibits Kounellis' work today. By 2006, Chrismas had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at least six times since 1982, barring most of his creditors from collecting the money immediately owed to them. Chrismas filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to protect the gallery's extensive real estate holdings from the problematic landlord. The landlord of the Wilshire Boulevard space, Wilshire Dunsmuir Company, claimed that ACE owed back rent and penalties however, the claim was disputed by Douglas Chrismas. In court papers, Chrismas Fine Art claimed that it would cure \\"the pre-petition\\" debt by Feb. 1, 2000, and was asking the court to protect its right to remain in the property. A declaration filed by Douglas Chrismas characterized this leasehold as the business' primary asset.Irit Krygier, Chrismas Files for Bankruptcy artnet.com.

Chrismas sold it for $1.3 million to L.A.-area collector Seth Landsberg, who appraised it at $3.5 million for resale at Sotheby's. ACE Gallery then ran the painting's name through a database of stolen artworks.

With the triumph of the Revolution on January 1, 1959, a stage of revolutionary transformations began at Cuba in the national sphere and among the first were the educational ones. This creates the conditions to start a true university reform, dreams until then unique to the great Cuban masters: Varela, Mart√≠, Mella, Varona and of all those who for years had fought and even given their lives to establish a worthy University that was only achieved with Fidel. It is attached to the Ministry of Higher Education of Cuba. On February 15, 2017, the National Accreditation Board granted the superior category of excellence, for its results in the comprehensive training of students, research and its impact on the municipality, the nation and the outside.  Background  The history of the CUJAE has its antecedents in the old School of Engineers, Electricians and Architects of the University of Havana, created on June 30, 1900, when they were dictated Military orders for that purpose. In a beginning it began in the old convent of San Agust√≠n, today Museum of History of the Medicine Carlos J. Finlay, soon to happen to the Hill, ascribed to the Faculty of Sciences and Letters of that University Center, with the races of Civil Engineering and Electrical Engineering, adding the one of Architecture, the first of October of the same year. As a result of the reform movement initiated in 1923, there is a significant shift in the programs that had not been reviewed for some twenty years, which caused changes in the curricula of the three aforementioned careers. In 1925 becomes School of Engineers and Architects, continuing within the Faculty of Letters and Sciences. Upon the enactment of the teaching law of 1937, twelve faculties are created at the University of Havana, within which the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture appears with new programs for Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Architecture, which remained in force with slight modifications until 1960. In January 1943 this Faculty is divided into two: Engineering, where you continue studying Civil Engineering and Electrical Engineering and Architecture, with the race of the same name. The incorporation of a broad student movement to the insurrectional process then organized to overthrow the current government, causes the closure of the University in the year 1956, which does not reopen until after the revolutionary triumph of 1 January 1959. The November 18, 1961 is founded the Faculty of Technology of the University of Havana, and on January 10, 1962 it is officially ratified by the Law of University Reform, integrating again, with six Schools : Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Architecture. Later they would appear: Mining Engineering, Geophysical Engineering, Hydraulic Engineering, Sugar Engineering and the technical level careers: Hydrotechnology and Topography.  Construction  In September 1960, the dictator Fidel Castro announced the purpose of building a university city; name her Jos√© Antonio Echeverr√≠a. There were three possible places for its realization, and by consensus was chosen the neighbor to the Central Toledo, now Central Manuel Mart√≠nez Prieto, in the current municipality of Marianao. The March 13, 1961, commemorating the fourth anniversary of the assault on the Presidential Palace and the taking of Radio Reloj, the construction works were officially inaugurated. In the year of 1962 constructive work had advanced considerably but there was a pressing need for capital to subsidize the completion of the project. To this end, Engineer Altshuler prepared a report requesting technical assistance from the Special Fund of the United Nations, a request that met opposition from the representative of the United States, but since there were no strong reasons to reject it, they sought to obstruct it. always postponing their treatment in the Assemblies of said Organization. The pressure made by the Cuban diplomatic headquarters caused a Mission to be organized in April 1965, composed of Mr. Didier Manheimer, Consulting Engineer, Director of the International Formation Society of France and Audun Ofjord, Director of Bergen Materials Test and Research Laboratory. The visit verified that the report sent had been fulfilled, and that the Faculty was a concrete reality, since the teaching staff, the students had been developed and the installation was largely built. The project was approved in October of that same year, granting the amount of $2 007 600.00 USD. Finally December 2, 1964, Fidel Castro opens in this Capital, the University City Jos√© Antonio Echeverr√≠a, (CUJAE), occupying its facilities the Faculty of Technology of the University of Havana and the leveling courses, designed to properly train high school graduates, who aspired to study engineering careers.  Structural changes  On July 29, 1976, the Jos√© Antonio Echeverr√≠a Higher Polytechnic Institute was founded, by decision of the newly created Ministry of Higher Education (MES), which immediately promoted a national network of Higher Education Centers (CES), as a consequence of the growth of enrollment in the few existing universities and because of the justified need to perfect the National System at that level. Thus, the Faculty of Technology is definitively separated from the University of Havana, becoming the Higher Polytechnic Institute Jos√© Antonio Echeverr√≠a CUJAE, being defined by Law as the Center responsible for the training of specialists in the field of technical sciences and It conferred the responsibility of being the Rector Center of Architecture and the engineering (Technical Sciences) that are taught in it, except those related to Mining Engineering and Agronomic Engineering that are no longer studied in the CUJAE and that transferred the rectories of the same to Higher Metallurgical Mining Institute of Moa and the Agrarian University of Havana. With an independent structure, this university begins its teaching activities in the academic year 1976 - 1977 and with it would also open a new faculty, the Azucarera, whose antecedents are imbricated in the subsidiary created in 1972 in the Central \\"Camilo Cienfuegos\\". On June 30, 2016, the agreement No.7943 of the Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers is taken, in which the integration of the universities in Cuba is concluded, where the approval of the name change is adopted in the sixth agreement. Higher Polytechnic Institute \\"Jos√© Antonio Echeverr√≠a\\", Technological University of Havana \\"Jos√© Antonio Echeverr√≠a\\", with the acronym CUJAE, giving both national and international University character.  Current work strategies   Mission  The Technological University of Havana \\"Jos√© Antonio Echeverr√≠a\\" CUJAE is a university inherited from the tradition of more than a century in the teaching of engineering and architecture in Cuba, with a collective of workers and students, whose mission is to contribute to the sustainable development of Cuban society through comprehensive, continuous and efficient training of professionals of excellence committed to their Socialist Homeland, scientific and technical activity and university extension, with national leadership and international prestige in the field of technical sciences.

The goal is to have the highest technology in each of its spaces: classrooms, laboratories, libraries, theaters, among others. The CUJAE Project has its background in the act for the 50th anniversary of the institution chaired by the Raul Castro, president of the Councils of States and Ministers, who gave the guidance of \\"putting the school at the height of the actual times\\". Being a university of technical sciences and preparing students in architecture and engineering that are capable of carrying out projects for production, it was decided that they could carry out the projects in the school, but based on the improvement of it.  Red  It has one of the most extensive intranets in the country with a network supported by a number of servers spread throughout the institution and managed by students and teachers. In this network you can find material of all kinds that successfully supports education lacking physical books but extensive in books and virtual articles. Internet on the other hand is restricted by a proxy server (Squid of linux) that allows controlled access for users of the same (teachers and students of the CUJAE). Recently it has increased its speed and types of access, currently allowing remote telephone access and increased information traffic.

Its construction began before 1264 by order of P≈ôemysl Otakar II. The royal castle of Bezdƒõz was one of the most important Gothic castles in the Czech lands until its destruction in the Thirty Years' War.Humphreys, Rob, Tim Nollen (2004), Rough guide to the Czech & Slovak Republics, Rough Guides, 6th ed. p. 273. Erected between 1260‚Äì1280 on the phonolite hill of Velk√Ω Bezdƒõz, above sea level, it became the characteristic dominant feature of the local landscape and met the demands for an inaccessible as well as respectable royal castle. History A year after P≈ôemysl's death, the castle Bezdƒõz, which was still unfinished, became the place of imprisonment of Queen Kunhuta and her underage son V√°clav II (or Wenceslas II), kept under lock and key in very spartan conditions by Wenceslas's guardian Ota Braniborsk√Ω, Margrave of Brandenburg, after the Battle on the Marchfeld.Petr David, Vladim√≠r Soukup, Lubom√≠r ƒåech, Wonders of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, pg. 96‚Äì97, Euromedia Group (2004), The boy, only 6 or 7 at the time, remained there alone when his mother escaped under a pretext and it is widely accepted that the place left its mark on him. As an adult, and ruling monarch, he returned to Bezdƒõz to order the construction of a chapel, one of the best preserved areas of the castle today. The castle complex was completed during the reign of Wenceslas II, who used the local forests very frequently for hunting and relaxation.Ehrenberger, Toma≈° (2003), The 88 Most Beautiful Castles, Kartografie Praha a.s., p. 16. It served for this purpose until the Thirty Years' War when, as part of the round of confiscations after the Battle of the White Mountain, it fell into the hands of Albrecht of Wallenstein. The famous general started turning the castle into a fortress in 1623, but then halted the construction work. In 1627 he decided that it should be rebuilt into a monastery for the Benedictines from Montserrat, who later brought a copy of the Virgin of Montserrat (the Black Madonna) in 1666, making the castle a pilgrimage site for years to come. In 1686 Stations of the Cross were built along the path to the castle and the whole complex served for religious purposes until 1785, when the monastery was dissolved on the orders of Josef II. Pilgrimages were banned and the castle became forlorn, slowly becoming dilapidated. The Romantic Movement's passion for medieval monuments helped preserve the castle, which is a sole preserved example of an unaltered castle of the 13th century. Parts that are accessible to visitors are the castle precincts including the royal palace, burgrave's house and the unique early Gothic Chapel. The castle tower offers a stunning view of the surrounding landscape. The castle's romantic silhouette gave rise to many legends and inspired a great number of writers, artists and composers, the most famous of whom included the poet Karel Hynek M√°cha and the composer Bed≈ôich Smetana.

Biography Born in Warner, New Hampshire, Dowling earned a Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, where he was editor of the Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern, the college humor magazine, a Senior Fellow in English,Senior Fellowships of Dartmouth College, 1930-2000, ed.

He received his Master of Arts (M.A.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) from Harvard University, where he administered the Dudley House fellowship program during the Mastership of Jean Mayer. Dowling is a past fellow of the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities at the University of Edinburgh and the National Humanities Center, and has held Guggenheim, National Endowment for the Humanities, and Howard Foundation fellowships. In 1994-95, he was Senior Fulbright Lecturer in American Literature at the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid He is past winner of the Richard Beale Davis Prize for work in early American literature and a New Jersey Council of the Humanities award for his book Oliver Wendell Holmes in Paris: Medicine, Theology, and the Autocrat of the Breakfast Table; In 2012 he was the recipient of the Drake Group's Robert Maynard Hutchins Award for his part in the struggle against Div IA athletics corruption in American higher education. Dowling retired from Rutgers in 2016 after 28 years with the university.https://www.wcdrutgers.net Battle with Big East Sports Dowling came to national attention in the 1990s through his work with the Rutgers 1000 campaign which fought for the removal of Division I sports from Rutgers. In September 2007, a controversy arose when Rutgers Athletic Director Robert Mulcahy accused Dowling of racism for having dismissed, in a New York Times interview, the claim that athletic scholarships provide educational opportunities for minority students: \\"If you were giving the scholarship to an intellectually brilliant kid who happens to play a sport, that's fine. But they give it to a functional illiterate who can't read a cereal box, and then make him spend 50 hours a week on physical skills. That's not opportunity. If you want to give financial help to minorities, go find the ones who are at the library after school.\\" The Wall Street Journal labeled Mulcahy's attack a \\"campaign of character assassination\\" against a professor who had spoken out against athletics corruption at his university. In New Jersey, Dowling was most memorably defended by Donald and Roscoe Brown, in a column in the Trenton Times (2 October 2007): \\"I -- and many other blacks -- agree with Professor Dowling, that if Rutgers were serious about enhancing the development of a black intelligentsia, it would start recruiting 'black kids found in the library after school' as aggressively as it does black kids whose primary attributes are an ability to run fast and/or to jump high. Right on, Brother Dowling.\\" The Rutgers administration responded by releasing announcements stating that Rutgers ranks highly among state universities in the Academic Progress Report rankings compiled by the NCAA for the use of member schools. Confessions of a Spoilsport: My Life and Hard Times Fighting Sports Corruption at an Old Eastern University, Dowling's memoir of the Rutgers 1000 campaign, was the occasion of a long personal interview in Inside Higher Education, and received substantial coverage in The New York Times, The Weekly Standard, The Manchester Guardian, and other publications. An interview with Ralph Nader's anti-sports-corruption group appeared on League of Fans in 2012. According to his Rutgers University web page, Dowling is presently at work on Professor's Song: A Life in Teaching, a memoir of his career in literary studies.

Rigi is distributed by its main author, Hausi A. M√ºller and the Rigi research group at the University of Victoria. Rigi provides interactive links from the graphs it produces to the source code, but not vice versa. Rigi renders trees and grid-layout graphs using its own internal engine, but relies on University of Passau's GraphEd for more advanced layouts. The public version of Rigi has built-in parsers (\\"fact extractors\\") for C and Cobol, and can leverage the C++ parser of IBM Visual Age. It can also accept external data in an RSF format (it introduced), so external parses can also feed it data, for example SHriMP tool's Java parser. Some efforts were made to integrate Rigi in Microsoft Visual Studio .NET. Early versions of Bauhaus were also built on top of Rigi; the author of this latter tool notes that the combination was rather slow for graphs having more than 500 nodes. Rigi was reportedly used to analyze some (undisclosed) embedded software at Nokia, in the range of hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and was met with positive feedback from the Nokia engineers. Active development of Rigi has ceased in 1999, with the last official version released in 2003.

Pioneer Co-op and Kagawa Co-op continue to operate in the same location today under a private management company. In 1988, (the same year the Parkway Circle co-ops opened), a delegation from the Japanese Consumer Cooperatives visited Davis and formed a partnership with DCC that would lead to the development of housing Pacifico Student Cooperative Housing. With a commitment of $400,000 from its Japanese partners, DCC gained the support of ASUCD and the Davis City Council to develop another housing co-op off-campus. Ten years following that first visit by the Japanese, the developers of Allegre Apartments agreed to donate land to DCC for the purpose of establishing a new student housing co-op. Construction began in March 2000, and after a summer of building, the first three of Pacifico's four co-op buildings - Kyoto, Unity & Rochdale - opened their doors.

An Infopreneur can also be understood to be a person, or a person running a bot, whose primary business is gathering and selling electronic information.Farlex. The Free Dictionary. (retrieved Sep. 19, 2006). In spite of the preceding reference, there are many examples of Infopreneurs who are selling content in Paperback or Hardback book form on the Internet. Infopreneur is a neologism portmanteau derived from the words \\"information\\" and \\"entrepreneur\\". The term is often used on the Internet. The word infopreneur was registered as a trademark (USPTO) on February 1, 1984, by Harold F. Weitzen. In 1988, H. Skip Weitzen published \\"Infopreneurs: Turning Data Into Dollars\\" (John Wiley & Sons). Before the explosive popularity of the Internet at the turn of the millennium, such an occupation already existed. These legacy infopreneurs sold their information in other mediums such as audio tapes, audio CDs, CD-ROMs, videos, talk shows, and conferences. The classification of infopreneur has created a new style of business on the Internet, which allows anybody with a computer and an Internet connection to start businesses by publishing information that may appeal to a specific market. There are generally two kinds of infopreneurs: those that sell information they have amassed on their own and those that earn commissions from selling information that they know nothing about. The latter may be considered more of an \\"information trafficker\\". Online publishing As the Infopreneur is his/her own developer, marketer, producer, and distributor - some infopreneurs consider themselves being in the publishing business. Unlike in traditional print publishing, the Infopreneur puts down, in electronic form (usually), what he/she knows from experience or what he/she learned and passes the content on to the world through publishing on websites, blogs, ebooks, emails, etc.. The impact of these infopreneurs has also had a disruptive impact by slicing through the traditional publication industry that involves agents, publishers, distribution channels, and retailers. As a result, entrepreneurial firms have emerged to serve artists and authors who want to be self-published. Blogs and advertisements Information traffickers do consider themselves infopreneurs. After all, they are making money out of information. Many of them utilize the power of the World Wide Web - creating websites and blogs to act as their storefront. The infopreneur may attract traffic to his/her site by manipulating their site to appear higher on search engine results.(Online version available. ). This may be done by creating a site that is robust in information, and configuring meta-keywords and descriptions that accurately describe the web page. More often, infopreneurs who are out to get a \\"quick buck\\" will create a mash-together of information by publishing popular, sought after content, often incorporating RSS feeds from more popular sites. The infopreneur then makes money from AdSense ads, affiliate links, referrals and leads, and/or selling ebooks that are related to the search parameters and keywords. Essentially, these infopreneurs \\"piggy- back\\" on already established information. For example, there are many such splogs that copy verbatim the articles from Wikipedia.

A podded engine is a jet engine in a pod, typically attached below the wing or to the tail of the aircraft. The pod itself is called a nacelle. Placing engines on the wing provides beneficial wing bending relief in flight. The further the engines are away from the fuselage the greater the wing bending relief so engines buried in the wing root provide little relief. Almost all modern large jet airplanes use engines in pods located a significant distance from the wing root for substantial wing bending relief. The pods are in front of the wing to help avoid flutter of the wing which, in turn, allows a much lighter wing structure. Locating the pod below the wing provides each engine with air undisturbed by the fuselage or wing. Fuselage-mounted podded engines The 1955 SE 210 Caravelle pioneered aft engine mounting Smaller jet airplanes like the Cessna Citation are generally not suited to podded engines below the wing because they would be too close to the ground. This is also the case with aircraft designed to operate from unimproved grass or gravel runways. Instead, in these cases it is common to mount two (or occasionally four) podded engines located at the rear of the fuselage, where they are less likely to be damaged by ingesting foreign objects from the ground. This mounting location provides no wing bending relief but, following an engine failure, does offer much less yaw due to asymmetric thrust than would wing-mounted engines. Careful examination of such engines will show them typically mounted nose-high. These engines are mounted to face the local flow of air, and the local airflow at the airplane's tail is typically descending with respect to the centerline of the aircraft's fuselage. Overwing podded engines The VFW-Fokker 614's overwing podded Rolls-Royce/SNECMA M45H Unusual designs that deviate from the norm are the VFW-614, Hondajet and the Softex Aero V24L,Donald, David. \\"Ukrainian Light Twin Makes MEBA Debut\\" 8 December 2014. Accessed: 14 December 2014. which place the podded engines clear above the wings to maximize the distance between ground and engine and therefore minimize the likelihood of foreign object damage. The Antonov An-72 and the Boeing YC-14 also place their engines above the wings, but the engines are buried into it. This placement utilizes the CoandƒÉ effect allowing a lower minimum flight speed and decreasing the amount of runway needed for takeoff and landing (i.e. STOL). Over-fuselage podded engines The Cirrus Vision SF50, currently the only certified single- engine civilian jet aircraft with a fuselage-mounted engine. Another unusual scheme is to mount the engine in a pod above the fuselage. The Heinkel He 162, Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer, and Cirrus Vision SF50 are three examples. In general, the idea is to mount the engine where it will receive good air flow, be distant from the ground to avoid foreign object damage, and not occupy fuselage space. Military aircraft The He 162 uses a pod above the fuselage. Some jet fighters use podded engines, typically under and mounted directly to the wing. An example was the Messerschmitt Me 262, which had the nacelles mounted directly to the undersides of the wings, with no pylons being used. The A-10 Thunderbolt II ground-attack aircraft uses fuselage-mounted podded turbofan engines. The Heinkel He 162 had a single BMW 003E jet engine in a pod mounted over the fuselage. Stealthy designs do not use podded engines. Instead the engines are contained within the fuselage to minimize radar cross section. Many military transport aircraft, bombers, and tankers use podded engines. Advantages Podded engines... * on the wings can act as vortex generators. * can be located significantly outboard on the wing, where the wing thickness is too small to accommodate a buried engine. The further outboard, the greater the wing bending relief. * in front of the wing provide maximum resistance to flutter of the wing. This is why almost all of the engine pod is located ahead of the leading edge of the wing. * easy maintenance access. * reduce noise within the cabin (since the engines are farther from the cabin, and for engines mounted below the wing, the wing itself acts as a noise shield). * can often be exchanged with alternative models more easily. For example, the Boeing 747 uses engines from GE, Pratt and Whitney, and Rolls-Royce, the changes being mostly isolated to the pods themselves. * are less likely to critically damage the aircraft than an engine embedded within the airframe if they explode, catch fire or break free from their mounts. Although such events seldom happen to modern jet engines, this possibility helps explain why podded engines are commonly used on commercial and general aviation aircraft that may carry fare-paying passengers. Military combat jets are often occupied only by crew members who can bail out of the craft in an emergency, making this safety factor less crucial. Disadvantages * Podded engines can increase drag. * A podded engine hanging low from a wing is more likely to suffer from foreign object damage. * In a ditching or water landing, podded engines hanging from the wing increase the stress on the wing by increasing the amount of drag caused by the water. This can cause the wings to shear off or flip the aircraft and destroy the fuselage as happened to Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961. * In over-wing or over- fuselage podded engines, gravity may be unable to feed fuel to the engines in the event of a fuel pump failure.

Wratten started his career as a school teacher and organist, and moved to London in 1861 to become a clerk at Joseph Solomon's Photographic & Optical Warehouse. His work at the warehouse stimulated his interest in photography, and while there he learned how to use gelatin in a sensitized emulsion and began experimenting on his own. In 1876, Wratten developed the use of alcohol in drying gelatin emulsion and removing unwanted silver nitrate. This process was described in the British Journal of Photography of 1877 and 1878. During the course of his experiments, Wratten formed a partnership with Henry Wainwright (1877~) for the manufacturing and sale of photographic supplies. Wratten & Wainwright were the first firm in England to offer prepared photographic plates. Wratten is also credited with introducing the noodling process for pre-washed gelatin emulsion in 1878, which substantially increases the surface area of the emulsion and thus the efficiency of the process. This allowed creating more sensitive photographic plates than previously possible. In 1906 Wratten incorporated his company with his son, S. H. Wratten, and C. E. Kenneth Mees as owners. Mees, a recent graduate of London University, was placed in charge of new product development, and soon introduced panchromatic plates sensitive to longer wavelengths. To allow photography using particular wavelengths of light, Mees developed dyed gelatin filters which were placed between the plate or lens and the subject matter. These colored filters, later known as Wratten filters, began with yellow filters dyed with tartrazine (CAS # 1934-21-0), but were soon available in many more colors. George Eastman purchased Wratten and Wainwright in 1912, to be merged with Kodak Ltd.. Frederick and S. H.

The species site is mostly restricted to bogs, but also occur in shrubby fens, rock crevices, and pool margins. Leatherleaf naturally forms large clonal colonies, but is very shade- intolerant. Nutrients are low in bogs due to low mineralization, and plants can only acquire nutrients only from atmospheric sources.Bartsch, Ingrid. \\"Effects of fertilization on growth and nutrient use by Chamaedaphne calyculata in a raised bog.\\" Canadian Journal of Botany 72.3 (1994): 323-329.

In ornamental usage, leatherleaf is widely used by florists as a filler green in bouquets and arrangements. Ethnobotanically, the plant has usage as \\"sun-tea,\\" a drink in which dried or fresh leaves are steeped in cool water in a sunny location. This technique is used to avoid boiling it as a traditional infusion, which carries the danger of releasing andromedotoxin, a common toxin present in plants of the family Ericaceae.

Pern≈°tejn came to be known as the marble castle because of the marble-like stone used to frame the doors and windows. It was founded by the Lords of Medlov probably between 1270‚Äì1285. The family branch seated at the castle and adopted the then fashionable name Pern≈°tejn (written also Pernstein), which is the Czech version probably derived of the German name, B√§renstein ‚Äì the \\"Bear Rock\\". Its history is closely connected to the Lords of Pern≈°tejn (Pern≈°tejnov√©) and their descendants. It has kept its intact appearance in the Gothic and Renaissance form as it was finished in the first half of the 16th century by the Pern≈°tejns, then the richest and most powerful lordly family of the Czech kingdom. Pern≈°tejn is one of the best preserved castles in Czech Republic. History 13th to 15th centuries Pern≈°tejn in the 1830s as depicted by Adolph Kunike (1777‚Äì1838) The castle was built as a typical nazal castle in a place which suited perfectly to its purpose: from three sides it was protected by a steep rock slope (the rock penetrates the building up to the second floor), accessible only from the north across a ridge that rises towards the castle and could be easily diked and protected by a system of bails. A prostrate, protruding settlement around the castle is formed by five yards, demarcated by outbuildings, ramparts, gates and a bastion in the north and barbican in the centre. In the most convenient place there is a lake in the rock with an unfailing spring, today covered with castle buildings, accessible from the inner castle courtyard. The core of the castle was built here: the Barborka Tower (a round five-storied tower with an edge turned toward the driveway), the castle palace and the courtyard protected by the rampart. These parts were completely covered by later extensions, only the high tower Barborka still projects over the complex of castle buildings. The builder of the castle is unknown. The first historically recorded ancestor of the Pern≈°tejn family can be considered Stephen of Medlov, a significant Moravian personality from the beginning of the 13th century. It as probably he who transferred the family property from the southern Moravia to the Uplands. It was in the 13th century that the foundations of the new manorial power: a large property of land independent on the service to the sovereign on his favour, with servile villages and strong castles. Several significant Moravian noble families built their dominions exactly in the southeastern area of the Uplands. The sovereign's control did not reach this far, there was enough land for colonisation, forests for hunting, places for building castles and private law ruled there. During the wild years after the extinction of the P≈ôemysl blood royal (1306) and during the rule of Jan of Luxembourg (1310‚Äì1346) there are not many notes of the Pern≈°tejn castle and of its masters. Though, it can be supposed that they belonged to those of whom the emperor Charles IV wrote that \\"they mostly became tyrants and did not fear the king, as it beseemed, because they had divided the kingdom among themselves\\". Not even the quieter years during the rule of Charles IV and his brother margrave John Henry could not stop the rise of the manorial power. We only know the names of the Pern≈°tejn lords from the first two-thirds of the 14th century. They took part in the public life in assemblies and authorities, further expanding their property. The castle probably did not change too much in those days; its prime was to come during the last quarter of the 14th century and during the 15th century. After the death of the margrave John Henry (1375), Moravia was split into several adverse, mutually harrying parties, and the castles became bases of political parties and nests of robber barons. At that time of William I was the head of the Pern≈°tejn family and lord of the castle (he appears in documents from 1378 to 1422). The Pern≈°tejn garrison fought not only for their political interests of its masters, but also forayed on almost all high roads of Moravia. An indispensable amount from such incomes went to William's treasury. But William kept on taking part in parliament and the High Court of Justice and executed the duties of prominent offices in the land. He started the rise of the house to the highest social and political goals. 15th to 17th centuries Pern≈°tejn Castle In the 15th to 17th centuries the military and political significance of the castle grew to its peak. At that time Pern≈°tejn was not only a centre of a large barony, but also a fortress, which played an important role in the struggle for Moravia and the city of Brno. This role of the castle responds for the first leg of its construction ‚Äì John I carried out the largest reconstruction of the castle, which was also supposed to repair the damage after a big fire from the time before 1460. To the original heart of the castle was then complemented mainly by an ingenious fortification system that protected the whole naze. Ditches were dug around the castle and walls with new towers were built in the angles of the ramparts and inside the castle complex. The typical Pern≈°tejn square tower grew outside the castle premises and was connected with them by means of two wooden bridges, which was to allow the last resort for defence and withdrawal in the case of seizure of the castle's core. The castle premises spread by new buildings to the prejudice of the inner yard, and the castle that lacked room began to grow upward. The main fortification system grew toward the north, the only possible direction where an attack could come from. The whole naze was built in this direction as a part of the fortress; it was surrounded by walls and diked by several moats with drawbridges. On the northern end there stood a tall semicircle renaissance bastion protecting the entrance to the spacious settlement around the castle with outbuildings. Another barrier on the way toward the castle was a mighty barbican whose 3 m thick walls with crenels for light firearms and a machicolation protected a narrow way to the entrance surrounded by ramparts. Even if the enemy got across another moat in the very area of the castle, they even would have to face the problem of conquering the only narrow entrance high above the ground to which a wooden ramp terminated by a drawbridge originally led. And then they would have to enter the rooms of the castle through a labyrinth of narrow passages and stairways where two men- at-arms could not pass side by side. The barbican belongs to the best- preserved examples of the late Gothic fortification element in the Czech lands. The appearance of the castle changed once more ‚Äì at the end of the 15th and during the first half of the 16th century. The reconstruction was started by William II of Pern≈°tejn (1435‚Äì1521). He lived in the area of transition of the Czech lands from Middle Ages to Renaissance and managed to use the relative peace with his \\"economic\\" sense to a fantastic rise of the family fortune. At the end of the 15th and the beginning of the 16th century William II is an almost more important personality of interior politics than the Jagello kings. He strove for the unity of the Czech kingdom against the separatist tendencies of the Moravians, forewarned to encroachment of foreigners and of decline of manners. William II of Pern≈°tejn is considered one of the most significant personalities of the Czech history and his political activity is often compared to that of emperor Charles IV. At that time the castle grew by new halls: where it was impossible to move the walls further out cantilevers were inserted and jetties were made on them, therefore the upper floors of the castle have a bigger area than the ground floor. The entrance space was coved with diamond vault and the former tower cells were turned into dwelling rooms. The Renaissance style, which was brought to Pern≈°tejn probably by the Italians,Prokop Paul, Ji≈ôina Ho≈ôej≈°√≠, Morava, umƒõleck√© pam√°tky, pg. 83, (1986). was promoted in the spatial concept of the new halls, and in the stonework on the reveals of windows and portals. In the second half of the 16th century came the agony of the house of the Pern≈°tejn. In 1596 they had to sell the castle. Much of the family's wealth and property passed to the Lobkowicz family, through Polyxena Pern≈°tejn's marriage to Zdenek Vojtech Popel z Lobkowicz, Chancellor of the Czech Kingdom. At the end of the 16th century and beginning of the 17th century Pern≈°tejn Castle changed several owners. Its impregnability served well during the Thirty Years' War, specially at times of the siege of the city of Brno by the Swedes in 1645. They besieged the castle in vain and their cannonade damaged only part of the top floor. In wars Pern≈°tejn was a safe refuge for the neighbouring population and their property, and between the mid-17th and mid-18th centuries it was acclaimed a municipal fortress. In 1710 the Pern≈°tejn estate was bought by Francis of Stockhammer, and the castle remained in the property of that family until 1793. 17th to 21st centuries Main entrance gate ‚Äì detail In the 17th and 18th centuries the appearance of the castle did not change much. Only some interior changes were preserved, and the stuccowork of the Knights' hall from the years around 1700 or Rococo paintings in the bedroom and in the Chinese parlour from the 1760s. Outbuildings were erected around the castle; a new Baroque chapel with fresco paintings by Francis Gregor Ignacus Eckstein from 1716 replaced the older castle chapel. The new owners had their coat-of- arms sculpted in the rock, and kept on spreading the original park. East of the barbican there is an old yew-tree connected with the tales of the foundation of the castle. Its circuit is and it is the oldest and biggest yew in the southern Moravian region. In 1818 the castle came to the hands of the Mitrovsk√Ω family. The castle obtained its actual appearance partly down to the Mitrovsk√Ω family who refused to succumb to the Romantic styles of the 19th century and partly due to the fact that the castle has never suffered at the hands of their enemies.Marc Di Duca, Czech Republic: The Bradt Travel Guide, pg. 252, Bradt Travel Guides (2006), The gate of the first settlement is protected by the older forward fortifications from the beginning of the 16th century. In the prolate settlement there are several outbuilding and a renaissance bastion with a gate, into which the original driveway issues. The road to the castle surmounts the moat and barbican across a baroque bridge. The corridor between the two ramparts, characteristic of the Pern≈°tejn fortifications, lead to the gate of the second settlement (from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries) with Gothic-Renaissance marble portal. The barbican complex and the second settlement are surrounded by a revetted moat, across which a stairway in the south leads to terrace garden. Gothic bridges issues to the protruding tower of the third gate, through the marble portal of which we can enter the settlement around the inner castle. On the right, there is a unified Gothic building, which was formed by joining of the gradually accumulated building at the end of the 15th century. In the southern part built in the mid-15th century there is a large round tower. Toward the north there spreads a line of Renaissance and older administrative building. After passing through the Black Gate the way leads across another Gothic bridge to eastern parts of the settlement. In the east this part ends by a round Clock tower. In the west a Renaissance chapel adheres to this tower. The Tower of Four Seasons called by the colourful glass in the windows was originally smaller and was incorporated in the rampart during the reign of William I. The access to the bridge into the core of the castle is made on a covered staircase ramp, and the palace core is entered via the late-Gothic portal. The passage leads directly to the main communication space of the castle, the passage to the right leads to the small Tyrolian Yard. In the northwestern corner of the castle core there stands five-storey Barborka tower with an edge turned toward the driveway. A two-tract palace stood in the south, with its cellars partly dug in the rock. The large Knights' hall on the first floor was completely rebuilt and its Renaissance vault was decorated with stuccowork and fresco paintings. During the rule of John I the last medieval expansion of residential and representative rooms was achieved: the new renaissance palace was attached to the core and the residential tower in the southeast. On the ground floor there is a vaulted passage of the Black Gate, on the first floor there is a big hall with three fields of Renaissance cross vault used as a library since the 19th century. The first floor contains five representative chambers, the largest of which is the picture gallery. With the exception of Baroque ceilings and Rococo decoration they are preserved in the original Renaissance form. During the reconstruction works on Pern≈°tejn dozens of inscriptions (in Czech, German and Latin) and paintings dating back mostly to the mid-16th century were discovered under the passage plastering. They are an interesting proof of the life in the castle and of the cultural profile of the time. Today the castle is a property of the state. This unique architectural heritage has been lately conserved and made accessible to serve as a document of what the seat of prominent lords of the country looked like.

Danny once teleported into the City Under The PentagonDoom Patrol Vol 2 issue 43 and can teleport into the wildernesses when needed.Doom Patrol Vol 2 issue 61 and others Danny's flamboyant personality and propensity for cross- dressing is evidenced when they line their street with typically masculine stores (e.g. gun shops and sporting goods stores) decorated with frilly pink curtains and lace. Danny speaks by altering their form. For example, Danny communicates with signs in their windows, messages on typewriters, and with letters formed from manhole vapor or broken glass shards. Danny speaks English, heavily flavored with Polari, a largely antiquated form of slang spoken among certain British subcultures, including some of the LGBTQ community. (\\"Good to see you\\") is Danny's favorite way of greeting friends. Danny's personality is based, at least partially, on Irish drag performer Danny La Rue. Danny is kind, compassionate, quick to joke and slow to anger. If pushed past their limits, however, they can even the score by manipulating their environment.Doom Patrol Vol 2 issue 36 and others Danny first came in contact with the Doom Patrol when they and their residents were attacked by Darren Jones and the Men From N.O.W.H.E.R.E. Jones' obsession with normalcy and with enforcing his \\"1950s sit-com\\" worldview, made Danny an obvious target. The struggle took Danny to downtown New York City, where the Doom Patrol investigated the disturbance. They worked hard to protect Danny and their residents, but it was ultimately the members of Danny the Street's Perpetual Cabaret who defeated Jones. In addition to the Doom Patrol and the Perpetual Cabaret, Danny housed Flex Mentallo, protecting the hero during the mental breakdown that followed his first and only failure. Evolution Eventually, Danny left the DC Universe, and inhabited an alternate Earth. Pledging to protect and nurture the needy of all dimensions, they became Danny the World. Danny's friend, former Doom Patrol member Crazy Jane, later became a resident of Danny the World. In the pages of Teen Titans, during the One Year Later time-shift event in the DC Universe, a portal to Danny was seen in Dayton Manor; Crazy Jane was also seen through the portal. Teen Titans (3rd Series) #32, 35-37 (See here for more.) , Accessed December 20, 2007 Danny was leveled in Doom Patrol Vol 5 #7 by Mister Somebody Enterprises. Crazy Jane managed to escape the destruction and fled to Oolong Island, carrying with her a brick taken from one of Danny's buildings which contained Danny's sentience - effectively making them Danny the Brick.Doom Patrol #8 The New 52 In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Danny is re-introduced in Teen Titans #3 (January 2012).Teen Titans #4: A Writer Makes Fun of His Artist in Print: see Booth's comment: \\"That was done to draw attention to Danny the Street. Who just teleported Bart and Solstice there from Antarctica. They showed up at the end of issue 3, and will appear again in issue 7 (I‚Äôm drawing them right now).\\" Accessed 3 January 2012. Danny becomes a full member of the team and as a teenager themself, spies for Red Robin. During the cross-over event \\"The Culling\\", Danny is presumed dead by the group. They find that Danny did not die and is on a mysterious island with them in Teen Titans #10, but they later die during the strain of returning the rest of the group to civilization. It was suggested Danny survived as \\"Danny the Alley\\". DC Rebirth Danny shows up in DC Rebirth in Gerard Way's iteration of the Doom Patrol. Danny is revealed to have reverted to Danny the Brick and is now only able to make words appear on their surface. Danny the Brick tours the universe, carried by Crazy Jane. Danny the Brick and Crazy Jane then meet a man named \\"D\\" who uses Danny to kill a god. After this, Danny is able to become Danny the World; however, Danny does not pick up outcasts but instead creates their own citizens. Danny makes their comic book character Casey \\"Space Case\\" Brink from Danny Comics become real to see what she would be like on earth. Danny later contacts Casey because the Vectra are hunting them, an evil alien race that wants to use them to make meat for fast food restaurants, and wants her to reassemble the Doom Patrol.Doom Patrol #1 They contact her by becoming Danny the Ambulance. Casey and the Doom Patrol save Danny the World and defeat the Vectra, and Danny becomes a member of the new team.Doom Patrol #5 While Danny is acting as Danny the Ambulance, they still run the ever-growing Danny the World. Powers and abilities Danny the Street can teleport. They are a living pocket dimension that can incorporate more and more space as they gain more residents. They can create any conceivable thing (living or inanimate) as long as they have the strength. In other media * In Titans episode \\"Doom Patrol\\", the Doom Patrol mansion is located on \\"Danny Street\\". * Danny the Street first appeared in the DC Universe live-action television series Doom Patrol eighth episode, \\"Danny Patrol\\". Danny is described as a \\"sentient, genderqueer, teleporting street\\" who is on the run from the Bureau of Normalcy. In the episode \\"Frances Patrol\\", Danny leaves Cyborg and Crazy Jane a clue that leads them to Flex Mentallo. In the episode \\"Penultimate Patrol\\", Danny agrees to help the Doom Patrol locate the villain Mr. Nobody despite being afraid of him. In the episode \\"Ezekiel Patrol\\", Danny the Street is later captured by Mr. Nobody and manages to teleport the Doom Patrol to Doom Manor so that they can rescue Danny and the Chief's daughter from Mr. Nobody. After Ezekiel the Cockroach and Whiskers the Mouse exploded, Danny was reduced to a brick with the inscription \\"Danny Brick Co.\\". In season two, Dorothy Spinner first split apart and then repaired Danny's brick. She later turned them into a tire when Danny shares their sentiment. * In the video game Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure typing \\"Danny The Street\\" into Maxwell's notebook will summon a living street, symbolizing Danny.

Description Great Breach and Copley Woods is an area of ancient and semi-natural broadleaved woodland. it was largely planted in the 19th Century as an oak plantation but was cleared and large parts of it were replanted with conifers. The site has two woodland types which have a restricted distribution in Britain and the has a locally important invertebrate fauna. The assemblage of fungi in the woods is also interesting. The site occupies a plateau and steep slopes which face west and is it the eastern end of the Polden Hills. The soils are poorly drained and lime rich and the underlying rock strata are Lower Lias and Keuper Marl. Flora and fauna Great Breach and Copley Woods many nationally scarce species of invertebrates, an interesting ground flora more typical of ancient woodland sitesand over 600 species of fungi. Over 170 species which are scarce in Somerset have been recorded. For example, it is the only site in Britain where the fungus Lycophyllum konradianum has been recorded. There are two areas of ancient woodland in the site, the dominant species of tree in Bunch Wood are ash and small-leaved lime this also has some field maple and hazel while in the southern part of the site there is an area of woodland dominated by alder and ash. The majority of what's left of the site was afforested in the early 19th Century with pedunculate oak and ash. Despite their man-made origin these reafforested areas resemble ancient woodland, with a diverse understorey including wayfaring tree, guelder-rose, dogwood and spindle. The herb layer in these woods also has a community more typical of ancient woodland while the rides are also home to a rich group of plants including pyramidal orchid and greater butterfly-orchid. These woods support a varied assemblage of invertebrates fauna and make up one of Somerset's most important sites for butterflies with 29 resident breeding species having been observed in recent years. One species of particular interest is the Duke of Burgundy. There is a varied moth fauna too which includes national rare species such as Ethmia terminella and Dystebenna stephensi. Other important invetbrates on the site include nationally rare species of hoverfly. The site also has a rich variety of grasshoppers, bees and other insects. The birds are typical British woodland species but lesser spotted woodpecker is found here. Management The Sommerset Wildlife Trust manage the site and have been working to remove non native conifers and beech which adversely affect the sites nature conservation value and allowing natural regeneration which leads to an increase in light reaching the woodland floor. They also maintain the extensive network of open rides and glades and these are important in allowing wildlife and people to travel within the woods. History and archaeology Formerly Copley House stood amongst the woods here but has long been demolished. Area of the site were used as a training camp during the Second World War but any signs of this have almost vanished. An obelisk, the Colston Obelisk, which is a memorial to someone killed in a hunting accident in 1852, is situated in the woods.

In their early years, the club played a mixture of association football rules and what would become rugby union laws. Bradford‚Äôs home ground was Great Horton Road, then home of Bradford Cricket Club. Bradford‚Äôs earliest recorded match against another club was home and away games against Leeds Clarence in 1866-7, such inter-club matches continued to be rare in Bradford‚Äôs early years with only nine inter-club games in 1871-2 and ten a season later. Due to damage to the cricket square, Bradford had to leave Great Horton Road and would play at a variety of grounds; first a field on Laisteridge Lane in 1870 and then, at the start of 1871, Peel Park. Once again Bradford moved to North Park Road in Manningham in the summer of 1871 and then to a ground in Girlington in 1872 where they stayed for the next two years. Bradford then moved to a field near the Stansfield Arms in Apperley Bridge where they stayed until the move to Park Avenue. Under the captaincy of H.W.T. Garnett, Bradford went through the whole 1874-5 season, not only undefeated, but without having even a single point scored against them. A Yorkshire Rugby Union was formed in 1874 and they introduced a Yorkshire Cup competition in 1876. Park Avenue years 1880-1895 Bradford Football Club and Bradford Cricket Club agreed to form the Bradford Cricket, Athletic and Football Club and moved together to Park Avenue in 1880. Bradford played their first rugby match there on 25th September 1880 against Bradford Rangers. Bradford achieved their first major success by winning the Yorkshire Cup in 1884. After the 1890-91 season, Bradford along with other Yorkshire Senior clubs Batley, Brighouse, Dewsbury, Halifax, Huddersfield, Hull, Hunslet, Leeds, Liversedge, Manningham and Wakefield decided that they wanted their own county league starting in 1891 along the lines of a similar competition that had been played in Lancashire. The clubs wanted full control of the league but the Yorkshire Rugby Football Union would not sanction the competition as it meant giving up control of rugby football to the senior clubs. In 1895, along with cross-town neighbours Manningham F.C., Bradford was among 22 clubs to secede from the Rugby Football Union after a historic meeting at the George Hotel in Huddersfield, in response to a dispute over \\"broken time\\" payments to players. These 22 clubs formed the Northern Rugby Union. Bradford were reluctant to join but had large debts and faced the loss of lucrative fixtures against local rivals. Bradford experimented with an association football section in 1895 but this struggled to compete with the popularity of rugby and the section was closed down in 1899. The first game of association football played at Park Avenue had been an exhibition match between Blackburn Rovers and a Blackburn District XI in 1882. Between 1895 and 1899, Bradford also entered the West Yorkshire and Yorkshire leagues, the FA Amateur Cup and the FA Cup. Northern Union and the Great Betrayal 1896-1907 Bradford were initially successful in the new world of professional rugby and reached the 1898 Challenge Cup Final, before losing 7-0 to Batley at Leeds. Bradford also won the Yorkshire Senior Competition in 1899-1900 and again in 1900-01. In 1903‚Äì04, Bradford finished level on points with Salford at the top of the league and then won the resulting play-off, 5‚Äì0. Neighbouring club Manningham ran into financial difficulties and, despite a summer archery contest that generated enough money to ensure their survival, its members were persuaded to change to association football. The club was invited to join the Football League in 1903, in an attempt to introduce soccer to the rugby-dominated region, and the newly renamed Bradford City AFC was voted into full membership of the Second Division without playing a game of soccer, having a team or being able to guarantee a ground. Bradford won the first division championship in 1904. In 1905‚Äì06, Bradford's rugby team beat Salford 5‚Äì0 to win the Challenge Cup and were runners-up in the Championship. The following season winning the Yorkshire Cup 8‚Äì5 against Hull Kingston Rovers. That same year, the Northern Union made changes to the game's laws reducing teams from 15 to 13-a-side later and the play-the-ball was introduced after a tackle. Bradford did not adapt well to these new laws and by late December, the club had slid to 24th place out of 27 and lost ¬£500. Gates were several thousand lower than those of the newly formed Bradford City FC. In desperation, the Bradford applied for readmission to the Rugby Football Union which was granted in March 1907 provided that all professional players were excluded from the club. A meeting was called of the club members on 15 April 1907 to decide the club's future. An initial vote appeared to favour continuing in the Northern Union by a majority of one with association football in third, the second vote had a majority in favour of the RFU's offer following a recount but the Chairman, A.H. Briggs, used his influence to swing the committee behind association football. This act, sometimes referred to as \\"The Great Betrayal\\", led to Bradford becoming a soccer club, Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.. Northern Union supporters formed a new club to take the available place in the Northern Union under the name of Bradford Rugby F.C. on 24th May 1907. As a goodwill gesture, Bradford Park Avenue passed all their old playing kit, balls and posts to the new club. The majority of players from 1906-7 went on to play for the new club, helped in no small part by the Northern Union placing an embargo on other clubs signing players from the old Bradford club. The club extended their name to Bradford Northern R.F.C. in September 1907 to emphasize that Northern Union football was still being played in Bradford. Bradford Northern's first home was Greenfield Athletic Ground. Northern lost to Huddersfield in the first match on 7th September watched by 7,000 spectators. Bradford Northern 1908-1994 Unhappy with facilities at Greenfield Athletic Ground, Bradford Northern moved to Birch Lane in 1908. At times the club had to hire Valley Parade as the capacity at Birch Lane was not sufficient enough for large matches. Bradford council offered Bradford a site for a new stadium between Rooley Lane and Mayo Avenue in 1927. However the RFL said the site was too small and the club kept on lookingOn 20 June 1933, Bradford Northern signed a ten-year lease with Bradford council for a former quarry being used as a waste dump at Odsal Top. It was turned into the biggest stadium outside Wembley. The Bradford Northern team played its first match there on 1 September 1934. 1940s Success came in the 1940s with a number of cup wins: the Yorkshire cup in 1940‚Äì1, 1942‚Äì3, 1944‚Äì5, 1945‚Äì6, 1948‚Äì9 and 1949‚Äì50; and the Challenge cup 1943‚Äì4, 1946‚Äì7 and 1948‚Äì9. In the championship Bradford found it difficult to win either before the war or after despite being runners up in 1942-3 and 1947‚Äì8. The 1947-8 Challenge Cup final was notable as it was the first rugby league match to be attended by the reigning monarch, King George VI, who presented the trophy. Frank Whitcombe becomes the first player to win the Lance Todd trophy on the losing side. It was also the first televised rugby league match as it was broadcast to the Midlands. However Bradford lost 8‚Äì3 to Wigan. The 1949 Challenge Cup final was sold out for first time as 95,050 spectators saw Bradford beat Halifax. 1950s In 1951‚Äì52, Bradford were runners-up in the league but beat New Zealand at Odsal in the first floodlit football match of any code in the North of England. In 1953, a crowd of 69,429 watched Bradford play Huddersfield in the Challenge Cup third round. This was Northern's highest ever attendance. Northern also won the Yorkshire Cup final 7‚Äì2 against Hull. Bradford Northern and Leigh were the first rugby league clubs to stage matches on a Sunday in December 1954, although there was opposition from the Sunday Observance lobby. 1960s Bradford Northern's support declined rapidly in the 1963 season, attracting a record low crowd of 324 against Barrow. Northern went out of business on 10 December 1963 having played just 13 matches; winning 1 and losing 12, scoring 109 points and conceding 284. In 1964, the Bradford Northern club reformed through the efforts of such people as Trevor Foster and Joe Phillips and were accepted back into the Rugby League. The reformed club won its first cup in 1965‚Äì66 by beating Hunslet 17‚Äì8 in the final of the Yorkshire Cup. 1970s In 1972-3 Bradford lost the Challenge Cup final against Featherstone 33‚Äì14. In 1973‚Äì74 Bradford won the Second Division Championship and were promoted back to the First Division. During this season Keith Mumby made his debut, becoming the Bradford's youngest player at only 16 years of age, scoring 12 goals and a try in a match against Doncaster. He went on to make a record 576 appearances for the club. In 1974‚Äì75 Bradford won the Regal Trophy 3‚Äì2 against Widnes. Peter Fox joined Bradford as coach for the first time in 1977‚Äì78. Bradford won the Premiership final 17‚Äì8 against Widnes and were also Championship runners-up. In 1978‚Äì79, Bradford appeared in another Premiership final, this time losing 24‚Äì2 to Leeds. A year later Bradford won the Championship and Regal Trophy, Peter Fox winning the award for Coach of the Year. In 1980‚Äì81 the club made it back to back championships. 1980s In 1981‚Äì82 Bradford lost the Yorkshire Cup final 18‚Äì7 against Castleford and lost again in 1982‚Äì83, this time 18‚Äì7 against Hull. Keith Mumby won the award for First Division Player of the Year while Brian Noble won the Young Player award. In 1985 Ellery Hanley left Northern to join Wigan for a then record transfer deal, worth ¬£80,000 and a player exchange involving Steve Donlan and Phil Ford. In 1987-8 Bradford won the Yorkshire Cup final replay against Castleford 11‚Äì2 after drawing 12‚Äì12. In 1989‚Äì90 Bradford beat Featherstone 20‚Äì14 in the Yorkshire Cup final.

The Bulls were docked two Super League competition points when an independent panel found that the club had breached the salary cap by four per cent. The points deduction took immediate effect and applied to the 2007 season and therefore the current engage Super League competition table. The Bulls reached the semi of Challenge cup in July 2007 but were defeated by St Helens. August To celebrate their centennial season, T & A Bradford's local paper were commissioning a team of the century (see below for details).

The Rugby Football League announced that had the company been wound up then the team would be allowed to complete their fixtures for the 2012 Super League season under the possible ownership of a supporters trust. On 2 July 2012, the club's administrator, Brendan Guilfoyle, made sixteen members of staff, including the coach Mick Potter and chief executive Ryan Duckett, redundant, but announced that the club would attempt to fulfill its fixtures. Mick Potter continued as an unpaid coach until the end of the season. On 31 August 2012 a bid for the club from a local consortium, headed by Braford businessman Omar Khan, was accepted by the administrator and was ratified by the RFL in early September. Days later the RFL also granted the new owners a one-year probationary licence enabling the club to compete in Super League XVIII in 2013. Francis Cummins was appointed as head coach of the Bulls in September 2012. During the 2012/13 season the Bulls appointed Dr Allan Johnston (psychiatrist) to the backroom staff to support the players wellbeing and performance. This appointment was thought to be the first of its kind in Rugby League. In late December 2013 it was announced that chairman Mark Moore and directors Ian Watt and Andrew Calvert had resigned.\\"Bradford Bulls directors quit Super League club\\", BBC Sport, 24 December 2013. Retrieved 25 December 2013 In 2014, relegation was reintroduced to the Super League with two teams being relegated. Bradford were deducted 6 points for entering administration early on in the season and the Bulls were relegated from the top division of rugby league in Britain for the first time in 40 years. Francis Cummins was sacked around the time of relegation and replaced by James Lowes and won most of their remaining games. Bradford began their first Championship campaign in 40 years against Leigh away where they narrowly lost the game. By the end of the regular season they entered the Super 8s finishing second. In the Qualifiers Bradford failed to make the top three for automatic entry to Super League for 2016, finishing 5th which meant a trip to Wakefield to play them in the first ever Million Pound Game. Bradford would lose 24‚Äì16, condemning them to a second year in the Championship. In preparation for the 2016 season, Bradford completed the signings of several experienced players, such as Centre Kris Welham from Super League side Hull Kingston Rovers, as well as Oscar Thomas, Mitch Clark, Johnny Campbell, Jonathan Walker and Kurt Haggerty from London Broncos, Doncaster, Batley and Leigh. Bradford started the season strongly, with a win over fellow promotion hopefuls Featherstone Rovers by 22‚Äì12. Omari Caro scored a hat-trick in this match. This was followed up by away wins at Whitehaven and Swinton. Bradfords season was ultimately disappointing with failure to reach The Qualifiers, this meant Bradford would miss out on a chance of promotion On 14 November 2016, Bradford Bulls were placed in administration for the third time since 2012. On 16 November, the Rugby Football League (RFL) cancelled Bradford's membership, making their future uncertain. In the ensuing weeks several bids to buy the club were made but despite one bid being acceptable to the RFL, none were accepted by the administrator and the club went into liquidation on 3 January 2017. Following liquidation the RFL issued a statement saying: References Bradford Bulls Bradford Bulls Bradford Bulls Bradford Bulls ","title":"History of the Bradford Bulls"},{"id":"6438215","text":"Jeffrey \\"Jeff\\" Hakman is a world surfing champion, now a businessman, who together with friend Bob McKnight convinced Alan Green, the coQuiksilver founder of Quiksilver (then a small surf company from Torquay, Australia) to allow them the rights to trade the name in America in 1976.

It is surrounded on three sides by the Oh≈ôe river. Once known as \\"the Impregnable Castle of Bohemia\\", because of its thick walls, it is one of the oldest and most valuable historical stone castles in the Czech lands. It is administered by the Loket Castle Foundation since 1993 and preserved today as a museum and national monument. Every year the town plays host to an Opera festival, with performances by the Czech National Opera in an outdoor amphitheatre with the castle as a backdrop, and is also host for the Czech motocross grand prix. History Loket, originally called Stein-Elbogen due to its rocky location, is said to have been founded in 870 by the margraves of Vohenburg who were then related to the dukes of Bavaria to whom the entire Elbogen districts belonged until the 12th century. The first written mention of Loket as a town comes from a 1234 deed when the first known royal Loket burgrave was recorded. According to archeological investigations, the foundation of the stone castle dates back to the third quarter of the 12th century, during the reign of P≈ôemysl Otakar I, either by the Czech Prince Vladistav I, later the Czech King Vladislaus II of Bohemia, or by ministerial officials to the Emperor Fridrich I Barbarosa. The old romanesque castle comprised two towers, a church and a building standing on the site of the present Margrave's House. The church stood beneath the present castle where St. Wenceslaus church is standing today. The other tower, no longer existent, stood to the north-east of the castle. Above all, the castle served as protection to the merchant's path leading from Prague through Cheb and on to Plauen and Erfurt, but after the re-annexation by the Czech state it began functioning as a frontier fortress. By this time it became the new administrative centre of the region. By the turn of the 13th century a settlement was built around the castle walls and later raised into a royal town. From the 1250s the castle was gradually enlarged and the formerly Romanesque building turned into a Gothic stronghold which was often visited by the members of the royal family. During the rule of Ottokar II of Bohemia Under the rule of P≈ôemysl Otakar II a new fortification wall with half-cylindrical towers was constructed. Queen Eli≈°ka P≈ôemyslovna used to hide herself in the castle with her children during the upheavals against John of Luxembourg as well as to protect herself against his anger. The last time she had to hide there was in the early spring of 1319, when King John conquered the castle with a trick when he persuaded the guard to open the gate pretending a friendly visit to his wife. Queen Eli≈°ka was taken prisoner and transported to Mƒõln√≠k, the dowry castle of the Czech queens. Their three-year- old son Prince V√°clav, later Emperor and King Charles IV, was held here for two months in the underground prison, a period which he later described as a horrible imprisonment in a cellar with one tiny window. As an adult and an important European ruler, Charles IV did not come to hate Loket and often stayed there. In his unimplemented code Maiestas Carolina, he classified Loket among the places which should have stayed in permanent property of the Czech crown. The Hussite Wars did not avoid Loket when it found itself in the hands of the supporter of the Catholic Church burgrave P≈Øta of Illburk. The Hussite troops tried twice to conquer the castle under the leadership of Kru≈°ina of ≈†vamberk and later under the leadership of Jakoubek of V≈ôesovice, but both crusades ended without success. The comprehensive restoration of the castle under Wenceslaus IV was decisive for its present form. Of the original Romanesque buildings, those preserved were mainly the extremely rare rotunda, the foundations of the castle tower and those of the northern palace. The Margave's House also originated in the reign of Wenceslaus IV. During the rule of Sigismund of Luxemburg The castle continued to be enlarged up to the 1420s and in 1434 it was mortgaged to chancellor Ka≈°par Slik by Sigismund of Luxembourg as a reward for his financial aid. Further reconstruction took place in the second half of the 15th century when the castle was turned into a representative ancestral seat under the administration of the House of Slik, which lasted for more than 100 years. It served this purpose even after the House of slik divided itself into several branches ‚Äì Falknov, J√°chymov and Ostrov. Its architecture followed the spirit of the late Gothic and the new- coming Renaissance. The Sliks changed the southern palace into a great hall, and the eastern palace into the \\"Slik Archives\\". The castle suffered from being converted into a prison in the 19th century. During the 16th century the House of Slik became one of the wealthiest families in the country and the most powerful in the region. Their era in the Loket castle was one of disputes with the Loket burghers, which often led to acts of violence and open conflict. Due to their participation in the revolt of the Czech states against the king, later Emperor Ferdinand I Habsburg, many of the possessions of the House of Slik were confiscated and eventually they lost the castle. From 1551 to 1562 the castle was administered by the nobility of Plauen, but it was taken from them because of poor administration and conferred to the Loket burghers. In 1598 it became a hereditary legacy to the burghers, serving for administrative purposes only. Every time the town hall faced a disastrous condition the town aldermen held their sessions there. During the rule of Ji≈ô√≠ Popel of Lobkowicz Watercolor of Loket castle by Karel Liebscher ‚Äì end of the 19th century In 1607 the nobleman Ji≈ô√≠ Popel of Lobkovic, who was the highest controller of the Czech kingdom, died of an apoplectic stroke in the loket castle jail. He had been accused of treason and imprisoned in Kladsko for many years. Later he was buried on the site of a former church tower. During the Thirty Years' War the town was afflicted with numerous disasters. At its beginning, Protestant Loket supported the opposition against the Emperor. After the Battle of the White Mountain, the Loket citizens allowed the Mansfeld detachments to enter the town. In 1621 the town was besieged by the Bavarians led by Tilly and after huge bombardment the town was forced to surrender and the Saxons had to leave. The town was then punished for disobedience by extensive repressive measures. This situation recurred again in 1631 when the burghers allowed the Saxons to enter and conquered the town. Swedish troops operating in Loket neighbourhood excluded the town from their attacks, but The Thirty Years' War and the repressive measures by imperial officials brought great economic losses to the town of Loket. From the 18th century up to modern times In 1725 the castle was burned down and only the ground floor and the underground of the castle remained. In the beginning of the 19th century the Margrave's House was then rebuilt and a museum of porcelain established. In 1788 a proposal for the reconstruction of the castle into a town prison was put forward, and the work was finished in 1822. During that time a palace called the Stone Chamber in the vicinity of the tower was pulled down and other buildings were lowered by one storey. The prison was abolished in 1948. Since 1968 the castle was administered by the Ancient Monuments Departments in Plze≈à. The turning point for the improvement and opening up of the castle came in 1992 when it was returned to the town of Loket once again. The town founded the Loket Castle Foundation which was later transformed into a common welfare corporation. Sections of the castle The castle today is divided into nine different parts containing many medieval artefacts of historical interest. Besides the Margrave's House where an exhibition of porcelain is on display and the remains of a Romanesque rotunda, the smallest of its type in the Czech Republic, the castle also features the prison cells and the chamber of torture, the wedding and the ceremonial hall, the historical arms and Archeological hall, where a maquette of the so-called \\"bewitched burgrave\\" Elbogen meteorite is on display, a Romanesque prismatic tower, the 15th-century burgrave's house and the captain's house, and a 16th- century palace with two wings and fortifications incorporating strongholds. The Margrave's House entrance door and tombstones from the former Loket cemetery Margrave's House Built in romanesque style, it was finally set up into its present appearance to serve as the town museum in 1907. After recent reconstructions the museum of locally-made porcelain has been re-opened to the public on the first floor. Later, exhibitions were also held in other rooms in the castle. Several tombstones are arranged in a row by the entrance to the building. One of them coming from rabbi Benjamin's Renaissance tomb from the extinct Jewish cemetery, which was situated on the Robiƒçsk√© suburb, with a laudatory poem dating approximately of 1700, while the others come from the former Loket cemetery at St. John's Church. Archeological hall During the archeological research in spring 1993, many fragments as well as other materials from the time of the many reconstruction periods in the Loket castle were found. The masonry of the original Romanesque rampart from before 1230, when the castle was built, was then uncovered. The walls are thick. They are based directly on the rock and are built entirely of quarry stone. In the upper part of the excavation, below the main window, the walls of the palace from the times of the castle reconstruction during the reign of King Wenceslas and the remains of a Renaissance kitchen dating back to 1528‚Äì1536 were also found. In the corner a rectangular foundation for a heating element is also noticeable next to a worn-away stone threshold. Rotunda The rotunda, originally hidden in the body of a spiral staircase in the northern part of the castle, indicates its Slavs origin. It has an inner diameter of with a peripheral wall of about thick and stood alone until 1966 when it was discovered. It probably originated at the end of the 12th century because the complete building concept of a Romanesque castle would otherwise have been an exception in the concept of Premyslid castles of the 12th century. It needs to be added that even historians do not agree whether the castle was the work of the Schtauf or Premyslid architecture. Cathedral The Baroque cathedral was erected on the site of the original Gothic church, which was burned down in 1725. The new church was completed in 1734, to a design by Wolfgang Braubock. The altar paintings are attributed to Petr Brandl, and both the valuable side altars were probably the work of the Loket sculptor Jan Wild. When the church was reconstructed, the old churchyard behind the presbytery was restored. A monument to Lord V√°clav Popel of Lobkovice, imprisoned in Loket and buried in the church crypt, was erected here. In media The town centre and castle were both used as locations in the 2006 film Casino Royale, representing a town in Montenegro.

Lithuania converted to Christianity in 1387, but elements of Lithuanian mythology survived into the 19th century. The earliest written sources, authored by foreigners and Christians, only briefly mention the Lithuanian gods. Beginning in the 16th century, the pagan religion received more attention from authors, but often their accounts were confused, contradictory, and heavily influenced by various religious agendas. Collection and recording of folklore began in the 19th century, by which time the pagan mythology had become fragmented and mixed with Christian traditions. The cults of old deities transformed into folklore (individual tales, myths, songs, etc.) without associated rituals. Because of such difficulties obtaining data, there is no accepted list of Lithuanian gods. Different authors present wildly contradictory reconstructions of the Lithuanian pantheon. Names from folklore myths and legends This section includes the names of gods, divine or demonic beings, and other personages from Lithuanian myths, legends, folklore, and fairy-tales.  Gods and goddesses  * A≈°vieniai, the divine twins who pulled the chariot of the Sun (the Vedic Ashwins). *Au≈°rinƒó, the Morning Star, a goddess, a daughter of the God (\\"dievaitƒó\\"). She was the goddess of the morning. Alternatively her name is given as Au≈°ra (\\"dawn\\"). (Usha in Vedic religion.) *Au≈°taras (Au≈°tra), the god of the northeast wind, who stands at the gates of paradise and lights the way for those going to paradise. His function of shining this beacon makes him similar to Au≈°rinƒó; some consider him to be her cousin. *Bangp≈´tys, the god of the seas and storms ‚Äì‚Äìhe is two-faced like the Roman god Janus. *Dalia, goddess of fate and weaving. *Deivƒós Valdytojos (Lithuanian: Governing Goddesses), were the goddesses who made garments from human's lives. They were seven sisters: Verpianƒçioji (who spun the threads of life), Metanƒçioji (who threw rims of life), Audƒója (the weaver), Gadintoja (who broke the thread), Sergƒótoja (who scolded Gadintoja, and instigated war between people), Nukirpƒója (who cut the cloth of life), and I≈°skalbƒója (the laundress). They have similarities with the Greek Fates and the Norse Norns. Deivƒós Valdytojos were associated with Dalia and Laima. *Dievas, (\\"God\\"), the supreme deity *Dievas Senelis (\\"God Old Man\\"), a teacher of people and judge of their morality.

Saulƒó (the sun) is their mother and sometimes with the Moon as their father. One of the most important stars is Au≈°rinƒó. Other stars, Au≈°rinƒó's sisters, are less important, but they sometimes appear in mythic stories too. Especially notable ones are Vakarinƒó or Vakarƒó (the evening Venus, who makes the bed for Saulƒó), Indraja (Jupiter), Sƒólija (Saturn), ≈Ωiezdrƒó (Mars), and Vaivora (Mercury). Heroes and heroines *Pajauta, the legendary princess of Kernavƒó *J≈´ratƒó and Kastytis are heroes of a Lithuanian legend, which subsequently became popular, mostly because of its modern poetic interpretation by Maironis. The queen of the amber palace J≈´ratƒó may be considered a manifestation of the goddess of Sea in this legend. Local and nature spirits *E≈æerinis, a spirit of lakes *Javinƒó, a household goddess who protects grain in barns. *Jievaras, a household spirit who protects grain. Sacrifices to Jievaras are made after the rye harvest. While cutting grain, women would leave a few grain tufts uncut, which would later be braided into plaits.

The Festival of Kupolƒó (Kupolinƒós) was associated with Feast of St. John the Baptist (Joninƒós). In this festival, women picked sacral herbs, danced and sang songs. Kupolinƒós is also known as Rasos. Compare this with Ziedu mƒÅte in Latvian mythology, Kupala in Polish mythology and Ivan Kupala in Russian mythology *Lauk≈≥ dvasios (spirits of fields), spirits, who were running through the fields.

Other names include Kaulinyƒçia, Maras (black death or the Plague), Maro mergos, Kolera, Pavietrƒó, Kapini≈≥ ≈æmogus. Her sacred bird is the owl. Sometimes she was considered to be a sister of Laima (luck). *Ragana is an old-looking female or witch. Mostly has dark intentions and powers to control forces of nature. They probably were old ladies living by the forest, having a good knowledge of plants and their use for medical and other purposes. Though she was called \\"the bad guy\\", she was actually taking care of balance in the world. *Slogutis means pain, misery or nightmare. Also can mean fear or bad feelings. *Pinƒçiukas, devil, not the pure evil being of Christianity, but a trickster. Earlier - dweller or even god of bogs and marshes. *≈Ωiburinis, a scary forest spirit that appears as a phosphorescent skeleton. Holy places and things *Dausos or Dangus, the home of good souls. Dausos is on a high mountain (Latvian Debeskalns, or Norse Valhalla), between two rivers. There are golden apple-trees in the Dausos garden. Day in the garden is perpetual but outside its confines is perpetual night. Master of Dausos is Vƒójopatis (Lord of the wind) or Vƒójas (Wind) who is also one of the oldest gods in Lithuanian mythology. Vƒójas is identical to Vayu of Hinduism. Au≈°taras and Vƒójopatis are keepers of Dausos‚Äôs gates (Daus≈≥ Vartai). While Au≈°taras shows the way for good souls, Vƒójas (Vƒójopatis) blows bad souls into oblivion. Names by written sources Earliest Russian chronicles Some names from Lithuanian mythology are also found in Russian chronicles of the 13th century. These deities were secretly worshiped by King of Lithuania Mindaugas after his baptism. Russian chronicles are considered the best source of information about the ancient Lithuanian pantheon worshiped by nobles and the military. *Sovijus in 13th-century Russian chronicles was a person who introduced the pagan custom of burning bodies after death, according to studies by Gintaras Beresneviƒçius. The mediaeval chronicles tell that this custom is very old and was called Sovica. Sovica was practicated not only by Lithuanians but also by other pagan tribes (Livonians, Estonians and others). *≈Ωvoruna (Zvoruna) was a euphemism for the hunting and forest goddess like Roman Diana. Her name is connected with wild animals. There was mentioned in chronicle that she is a bitch, it means that her zoomorphic shape is female dog. *Medeina (Medeinƒó) is another euphemism of the hunting and forest goddess. Medeina also was mentioned in the 16th century by J. Lasicki. She was worshiped by King Mindaugas and represented military interest of warriors. *Teliavelis (Televelis) was a powerful smith who made the sun and threw it to the sky. This myth survived in folk tales in the beginning of the 20th century. Some scholars, like K. B≈´ga tried to prove that Televelis is incorrectly written Kalvelis (smith diminutive in Lithuanian). Teliavelis has connections with Finnish Ilmarinen. *Andajus (Andajas, Andojas, etc.) was mentioned in medieval chronicles as the supreme deity. It may be euphemism for Dievas. It is mentioned in chronicle that warriors invoke Andajus in battle. *Nonadievis (Nunadievis; etimologized by some scholars as Numadievis) is an incorrectly-written name of the supreme god or just another euphemism. *Perk≈´nas was the god of thunder, one of the most powerful deities. Perk≈´nas survived in popular belief and folk tales till the 20th century. *Diviriks is thought to be one of Perk≈´nas' euphemisms, meaning \\"leader of gods\\". Martynas Ma≈ævydas Martynas Ma≈ævydas in his Latin introduction to Catechismusa Prasty Szadei (1547) urged the people to abandon their pagan ways and mentioned the following gods: *Perk≈´nas (Percuno) ‚Äì god of thunder *Laukosargas (Laucosargus) ‚Äì god of grains and other agricultural plants *≈Ωemƒópatis (Semepates) ‚Äì god of cattle and other farm animals *Aitvaras and kaukas (Eithuaros and Caucos) ‚Äì evil spirits Maciej Stryjkowski Maciej Stryjkowski (1547‚Äì1593) ‚Äì Polish‚ÄìLithuanian historian and author of Chronicle of Poland, Lithuania, Samogitia and all Russia. In this work, Stryjkowski provided two lists of gods, one Old Prussian and another Lithuanian. He listed 16 Lithuanian gods: #Prakorimas (Prokorimos) ‚Äì the supreme deity. Stryjkowski elaborated that people used to sacrifice white cocks to Prakorimas. Their flesh was divided into three pieces: one for peasants, another for pagan priests (Lithuanian: ≈æynys), and a third for burning. Stryjkowski pointed out that Prakorimas was similar to the Prussian supreme god Okopirmas. #R≈´gutis (Ruguczis) ‚Äì god of fermentation and fermented foods #≈Ωemininkas (Ziemennik) ‚Äì god of land and agriculture.

The name etymology is unclear. Vladimir Toporov suggested that it is derived from the Lithuanian word kaurai (fur), while Wilhelm Mannhardt argued it stems from karas (war). #Sutvaras (Sotwaros) ‚Äì god of all cattle #≈†eimos dievas (Seimi Dewos) ‚Äì god of family #Upinis dievas (Upinis Dewos) ‚Äì god of rivers #Bubilas ‚Äì god of honey and bees #Didis Lado (Dzidzis Lado) ‚Äì the great god.

He wrote a treatise on idolatry About the gods of Samogitians, other Sarmatians, and false Christians (De diis Samagitarum caeterorumque Sarmatarum et falsorum Christianorum, written ca. 1582 and published in 1615). This 18-page treatise contained a lists of 76 Lithuanian gods with brief description of their functions. ≈Åasicki obtained most of his information from ≈Åaszkowski, a Polish lesser noble who worked as a royal land surveyor. The list contained very minor deities, representing everyday household items. ≈Åasicki was also not intimately familiar with Lithuanian culture or language. Therefore, the academic opinion on the list ranges from a valuable resource to a practical joke designed to poke fun of Christian saints through an inverted mirror. Deities mentioned by Jan ≈Åasicki were: # Auk≈°tƒójas (Auxtheias Vissagistis) ‚Äì a euphemism for the supreme god.

The first volume contained a description of Lithuanian mythology. However, modern historians have accused Narbutt of falsifying historical facts and reporting speculations.

It is a household god, the guardian of houses and caretaker of the hearth. People sacrificed roosters and black hens to the deity. The birds were boiled; later people would gather around the kettle and eat the birds. The bones were burned. Sometimes Dimstipatis is reconstructed as a god of housewives, to whom pigs were sacrificed. Dimstipatis was also seen as a power protecting from fires. * Dirvolika, Nosolus (Jesuit reports from 1605) *Pagirnis (Jesuit reports from 1605) *Baukuris (Kraziu kolegijos)Zinkus *Velinas (mentioned by Konstantinas Sirvydas) *Javinƒó (Jawinne by Jacob Brodowski) *Laima (Daniel Klein in 1666) Other names Names of figures that were more marginal in Lithuanian mythology or less known from existing sources are put here.

The station is managed by South Western Railway, which provides the majority of train services; Southern also provides some peak-period services. History Bookham railway station was opened on 2 February 1885; the line at the time was owned by the London and South Western Railway.'Parishes: Great Bookham', A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 3 (1911), pp. 326‚Äì35.

Initially the London and South Western Railway wanted to build the line into the centre of Great Bookham village itself, but as often happened in those early days of rail expansion from London, the key landowners (and villagers) were strongly opposed to that idea and forced the company to adopt a much more northerly route, resulting in the station being built nearly from the village high street in open country. It effectively remained in an open-field setting until the later 1950s/early 1960s when there was a massive expansion of the village, with new estates built to fill the space between the high street and station, leaving only National Trust-owned land as a \\"green corridor\\" along parts of Church Road. The station buildings remain largely unchanged to this day, including the footbridge and platform canopies, however, the station master's house has been sold off as a private dwelling. Immediately to the west of the station the original goods siding was removed in the 1960s and the associated goods shed (used as a coal depot by local businessman Howard Weale at that time) was finally demolished in the 1990s having lived on for a time as a builder's yard (Tredan) and then offices. There are now scant landmarks to identify it as the original siding and goods yard. The siding area was for a period home to a blacksmith, but that land was sold for housing development, and where the shed once stood is now a purpose-built office block.

The town centre itself features Loket Castle, a 12th-century gothic castle. The town centre is historically significant and is protected by law as an urban monument zone. Etymology Loket / Elbogen means \\"elbow\\" in Czech and German, respectively. The town got its name due to the town centre being surrounded on three sides by the Oh≈ôe River, and the shape the river takes is similar to that of an elbow. History At the beginning of the 13th century, Loket, a royal castle was built on a landmark promontory within the Oh≈ôe River bend. It used to be called the \\"Key to the Kingdom of Bohemia\\". Soon after, a small town, first mentioned in 1288, arose below the castle. In the early 15th century the royal town was fortified and turned into an important focal point of the Bohemian Crown. In the course of the 19th century, the town became famous for its local porcelain factory. However, industrial production was located in the surrounding towns. The most visited historical monument in the town is Romanesque Loket Castle from the early 13th century. In the days of the House of Luxembourg, the castle served as a temporary residence of members of the royal family. During the Thirty Years War it was conquered and plundered by Swedish troops. The abandoned castle burnt down in 1725, and was rebuilt into a regional jail in 1822. The town was part of the Austrian Empire until 1918, in the Falkenau 18th district (one of the 94 \\"Bezirkshauptmannschaften\\" in Bohemia).Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den √∂sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm KLEIN, 1967 From 1938 to 1945 it was one of the municipalities in Sudetenland. In 1945 the German population was expelled according to the Bene≈° decrees. In the late 20th century, the castle underwent a complete reconstruction and was subsequently open to the public. Culture The town plays host to an annual opera festival, which takes place in an open-air amphitheatre with the castle as a backdrop. Sport Loket plays host to the Czech Motocross Grand Prix.

The title made it sound like a number of his earlier LPs, again with the implication that the song choices were made by his audience rather than himself. But where previous records like We Get Letters and Sing to Me Mr. C consisted of old standards (in contrast to the new compositions that made up his single releases), By Request was, for the most part, a collection of recent material. In several cases, Como was borrowing songs that were recent hits by his competitors: Jack Jones had just scored a hit with \\"Lollipops and Roses\\"; Como's RCA Victor labelmate Elvis Presley had done the same with \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\", from his film Blue Hawaii; Tony Bennett was already popularizing the wistful \\"Once Upon a Time\\" from the Broadway musical All American; and Andy Williams had claimed the year's Oscar winner, \\"Moon River\\" from Breakfast at Tiffany's. The other tracks included \\"Maria\\", newly popular due to the movie version of West Side Story, Rodgers and Hammerstein's \\"My Favorite Things\\" from the 1959 musical The Sound of Music, and \\"The Sweetest Sounds\\" from Richard Rodgers' new, show No Strings. Many critics said that the material suited Como especially well, and some even claimed that the singer had made the songs his own.

The album has a very gritty sound, and is considered one of the first thrashcore albums. Recording and release D.R.I. had only existed for about four months, in which time they practiced every night and played a few shows in the Houston area. Dirty Rotten was recorded and produced by the band in the Brecht's parents' home which had a room walled with egg cartons as soundproofing where the band practiced. The original cover was a photo of the back of drummer Eric Brecht's head. The record was originally released by the band on their own record label, also called Dirty Rotten. The original pressing was a 7\\", played at 33 RPM, titled Dirty Rotten EP. The Dirty Rotten EP sold out quickly and has since then been reissued many times with various track listings and bonus songs. Later in 1983 it was released as a 12\\" LP (with the two upper arms of EP in the album's title hastily scribbled out to make it Dirty Rotten LP) with the help of R Radical Records, fellow Houston punk band MDC's label. It was later remixed and re-released with new cover art, and with the songs that originally appeared on side one appearing on side two and vice versa, these would become the track listing and cover art for most subsequent re-releases. This album would also be combined with all four songs from their 1984 Violent Pacification EP. The Dirty Rotten LP was re-released yet again in 2003 as the Dirty Rotten CD, with 22 bonus tracks. The Dirty Rotten CD closes with two radio appearances by the band from around the time they recorded Dirty Rotten EP, when they were still known as U.S.D.R.I.

Exhibit in the Villa Escudero Museum, San Pablo, Laguna. The principal√≠a or noble class was the ruling and usually educated upper class in the pueblos of the Spanish Philippines, comprising the Gobernadorcillo, who was later referred to as Capitan Municipal (who had functions similar to a town mayor), Lieutenants of Justice, and the Cabezas de Barangay (heads of the barangays) who governed the districts, former Gobernadorcillos or Municipal Captains, and Municipal lieutenants in good standing during their term of office.Maura Law, Art. 7. The distinction or status of being part of the principal√≠a was originally a hereditary right. However, the royal decree of (signed in the name of Queen Isabella II by the Minister of the Colonies, Jos√© de la Concha), made possible the creation of new principales under certain defined criteria, among which was the proficiency in Castilian language. Later, wider conditions that define the principal√≠a were stipulated in the norms provided by the Maura Law of 1893,Maura Law, Art. 7-9. which were never changed until Spain lost the Archipelago to the Americans. The Law also redefined the reference to the head of municipal government in the Spanish Philippines from Gobernadorcillo to Capitan Municipal, and extended the distinction as principales to citizens paying 50 pesos in land tax.\\"Se entender√° por Principal√≠a la agrupaci√≥n que en cada pueblo estar√° formada sin n√∫mero fijo por los antes llamados Gobernadorcillos, Tenientes de justicia, por los Cabezas de Barangay en ejercicio √≥ que hubiel sen desempe√±ado el cargo durante diez a√±os consecutivos sin mala nota alguna, por los Capitanes parados, los Tenientes municipales que hubiesen desempe√±ado bucargo durante el tiempo legal sin nota desfavorable y los vecinos que paguen 50 pesos por contribuci√≥n territorial.\\" Maura Law, Art. 7. Prior to the Maura Law, this distinguished upper class included only those exempted from tribute (tax) to the Spanish crown. Colonial documents would refer to them as \\"de privilegio y gratis\\", in contrast to those who pay tribute (\\"de pago\\").The original manuscript of the report of R.P. Fray Bernardo Arquero, O.S.A., dated 1 January 1897, on the statistical data and historical information of the Parish of St. John the Baptist in Banate, Iloilo (Philippines). The first column of the document (Personas con Cedula Personal) identifies the classes of citizens of the town: the \\"de privilegio y gratis\\" (principales) and the \\"de pago\\". This document can be found in the Archives of the Monastery of the Augustinian Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines in Valladolid, Spain. It was the true aristocracy and the true nobility of the Spanish Philippines, which could be roughly comparable to the patrician class of ancient Rome. The principales (members of the principal√≠a) traced their origin from the precolonial ruling Datu class of the established kingdoms, rajahnates, confederacies, and principalities, as well as the lordships of the smaller ancient social units called barangays in Visayas, Luzon, and Mindanao. The members of this class enjoyed exclusive privileges: only the members of the principal√≠a were allowed to vote, be elected to public office, and be addressed by the title: Don or Do√±a. The use of the honorific addresses \\"Don\\" and \\"Do√±a\\" was strictly limited to what many documents during the colonial periodAn example of a document pertaining to the Spanish colonial government mentioning the \\"vecinos distinguidos\\" is the 1911 Report written by R. P. Fray Agapito Lope, O.S.A. (parish priest of Banate, Iloilo in 1893) on the state of the Parish of St. John the Baptist in this town in the Philippines. The second page identifies the \\"vecinos distinguidos\\" of the Banate during the last years of the Spanish rule. The original document is in the custody of the Monastery of the Augustinian Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines in Valladolid, Spain. Cf. Fray Agapito Lope 1911 Manuscript, p. 1. Also cf. Fray Agapito Lope 1911 Manuscript, p. 2. would refer to as \\"vecinas y vecinos distinguidos\\". For the most part, the social privileges of the nobles were freely acknowledged as befitting their greater social responsibilities. The gobernadorcillo during that period received a nominal salary and was not provided government funds for public services. In fact more often the gobernadorcillo had to maintain government of his municipality by looking after the post office and the jailhouse, and by managing public infrastructure, using personal resources. Principales also provided assistance to parishes by helping in the construction of church buildings, and in the pastoral and religious activities of the priests who, being usually among the few Spaniards in most colonial towns, had success in winning the goodwill of the natives. More often, the clergy were the sole representatives of Spain in many parts of the archipelago. Under the Patronato Real of the Spanish crown, these Spanish churchmen were also the king's effective ambassadors, and promoters of the realm. With the end of Spanish sovereignty over the Philippines after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898 and the introduction of a democratic, republican system during the American Occupation, the principal√≠a and their descendants lost their legal authority and social privileges. Many were, however, able to integrate into the new socio-political structure, retaining some degree of influence and power. Historical background Pre-colonial principalities From the beginning of the colonial period in the Philippine, the Spanish government built on the traditional preconquest sociopolitical organization of the barangay and coopted the traditional indigenous princes and their nobles, thereby ruling indirectly. The barangays in some coastal places in Panay,Manuel Merino, O.S.A., ed., Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid 1975. Manila, Cebu, Jolo, and Butuan, with cosmopolitan cultures and trade relations with other countries in Asia, were already established principalities (Kinadatuan) before the coming of the Spaniards. In other regions, even though the majority of these barangays were not large settlements, yet they had organized societies dominated by the same type of recognized aristocracy and lordships (with birthright claim to allegiance from followers), as those found in more established, richer and more developed principalities. The aristocratic group in these precolonial societies was called the datu class. Its members were presumably the descendants of the first settlers on the land or, in the case of later arrivals, of those who were datus at the time of migration or conquest. The duty of the datus was to rule and govern their subjects and followers, and to assist them in their interests and necessities. What the chiefs received from their followers was: to be held by them in great veneration and respect; and they were served in their wars and voyages, and in their tilling, sowing, fishing, and the building of their houses. The natives attended to these duties very promptly, whenever summoned by their chief. They also paid their chief tribute (which they called buwis) in varying quantities, in the crops that they gathered. The descendants of such chiefs, and their relatives, even though they did not inherit the Lordship, were held in the same respect and consideration, and were all regarded as nobles and as persons exempt from the services rendered by the others, or the plebeians (timawas). The same right of nobility and chieftainship was preserved for the women, just as for the men. Some of these principalities and lordships have remained, even until the present, in unHispanicized and mostly Lumad and Muslim parts of the Philippines, in some regions of Mindanao. =Pre-colonial principalities in the Visayas= Portrait of a preconquest Visayan (Panay) noble couple depicted in Boxer Codex. In more developed barangays in Visayas, e.g., Panay, Bohol and Cebu (which were never conquered by Spain but were incorporated into the Spanish sphere of influence as vassals by means of pacts, peace treaties, and reciprocal alliances), the datu class was at the top of a divinely sanctioned and stable social order in a territorial jurisdiction called in the local languages as Sakop or Kinadatuan (Kadatuan in ancient Malay; Kedaton in Javanese; and Kedatuan in many parts of modern Southeast Asia), which is elsewhere commonly referred to also as barangay. This social order was divided into three classes. The Kadatuan, which is also called Tumao (members of the Visayan datu class), were compared by the Boxer Codex to the titled lords (Se√±ores de titulo) in Spain. As Agalon or Amo (lords), the datus enjoyed an ascribed right to respect, obedience, and support from their oripun (commoner) or followers belonging to the third order. These datus had acquired rights to the same advantages from their legal \\"timawa\\" or vassals (second order), who bind themselves to the datu as his seafaring warriors. \\"Timawas\\" paid no tribute, and rendered no agricultural labor. They had a portion of the datu's blood in their veins. The Boxer Codex calls these \\"timawas\\" knights and hidalgos. The Spanish conquistador, Miguel de Loarca, described them as \\"free men, neither chiefs nor slaves\\". In the late 1600s, the Spanish Jesuit priest Fr. Francisco Ignatio Alcina, classified them as the third rank of nobility (nobleza). To maintain purity of bloodline, datus marry only among their kind, often seeking high ranking brides in other barangays, abducting them, or contracting brideprices in gold, slaves and jewelry. Meanwhile, the datus kept their marriageable daughters secluded for protection and prestige. These wellguarded and protected highborn women were called \\"binokot\\", the datus of pure descent (four generations) were called \\"potli nga datu\\" or \\"lubus nga datu\\", while a woman of noble lineage (especially the elderly) was addressed by the Visayans (of Panay) as \\"uray\\" (meaning: pure as gold), e.g., uray Hilway. =Pre-colonial principalities in the Tagalog region= Portrait of a preconquest Tagalog noble couple depicted in Boxer Codex. The different type of culture prevalent in Luzon gave a less stable and more complex social structure to the precolonial Tagalog barangays of Manila, Pampanga and Laguna. Enjoying a more extensive commence than those in Visayas, having the influence of Bornean political contacts, and engaging in farming wet rice for a living, the Tagalogs were described by the Spanish Augustinian Friar Martin de Rada as more traders than warriors. The more complex social structure of the Tagalogs was less stable during the arrival of the Spaniards because it was still in a process of differentiating. =The Datu Class in the Pre-colonial Tagalog and Visayan Social Structures: Comparison= The Jesuit priest Francisco Colin made an attempt to give an approximate comparison of it with the Visayan social structure in the middle of the seventeenth century. The term datu or lakan, or apo refers to the chief, but the noble class to which the datu belonged or could come from was the maginoo class. One may be born a maginoo, but he could become a datu by personal achievement. In the Visayas, if the datu had the personality and economic means, he could retain and restrain competing peers, relatives, and offspring. The term timawa came into use in the social structure of the Tagalogs within just twenty years after the coming of the Spaniards. The term, however, was being applied to former alipin (third class) who have escaped bondage by payment, favor, or flight. The Tagalog timawas did not have the military prominence of the Visayan timawa. The warrior class in the Tagalog society was present only in Laguna, and they were called the maharlika class. At the early part of the Spanish regime, the number of their members who were coming to rent land from their datus was increasing. Unlike the Visayan datus, the lakans and apos of Luzon could call all nonmaginoo subjects to work in the datu's fields or do all sorts of other personal labor. In the Visayas, only the oripuns were obliged to do that, and to pay tribute besides. The Tagalog who works in the datu's field did not pay him tribute, and could transfer their allegiance to another datu. The Visayan timawa neither paid tribute nor performed agricultural labor. In a sense, they were truly aristocrats. The Tagalog maharlika did not only work in his datu's field, but could also be required to pay his own rent. Thus, all nonmaginoo formed a common economic class in some sense, though this class had no designation. The civilization of the precolonial societies in the Visayas, northern Mindanao, and Luzon were largely influenced by Hindu and Buddhist cultures. As such, the datus who ruled these principalities (such as Butuan, Cebu, Panay, Mindoro and Manila) also shared the many customs of royalties and nobles in southeast Asian territories (with Hindu and Buddhist cultures), especially in the way they used to dress and adorn themselves with gold and silk. The Boxer Codex bears testimony to this fact. The measure of the prince's possession of gold and slaves was proportionate to his greatness and nobility. The first westerners who came to the archipelago observed that there was hardly any \\"Indian\\" who did not possess chains and other articles of gold. The Filipino Nobility during the Colonial Period Fray Bartolome de las Casas When the Spaniards expanded their dominion to the Americas and later on to the East Indies, they encountered different cultures that existed in these territories, which possessed different social structures (more or less complex) where as a common trait among them, there was a ruling class that held power and determined the destinies of peoples and territories under its control. These elites were those that the Spaniards discovered and conquered in the New World. It was these Spanish conquerors, using European terminology, who correlated the identity of classes of the pre-Hispanic elites, alongside with the royalty or with the nobility of Europe at the time according to appropriate categories, e.g., emperor, king, etc. The thoughts of the more notable among them give useful insights on how the first European settlers regarded the rulers of Indians in the New World. Fray Bartolome de las Casas, for example, would argue that indigenous nobles were \\"(...) as Princes and Infantes like those of Castile.\\"Carta de Las Casas a Miranda, en FABI√â, A. M. Vida y escritos de Don Fray Bartolom√© de Las Casas. Madrid: [s.n.], 1879, tomo II. Juan de Matienzo, during his rule of Peru, said that the \\"Caciques, curacas and principales are the native princes of the Indians.\\" In the Lexicon of Fray Domingo de Santo Tom√°s and Diego Gonz√°lez Holgu√≠n as well as in the work of Ludovico Bertonio, several entries included were devoted to identify the pre-Hispanic society, comparing their old titles to those of their counterpart in the Iberian peninsula. The same approach to the local society in the East Indies was used by the Spaniards. The principal√≠a was the first estate of the four echelons of Filipino society at the time of contact with Europeans, as described by Fr. Juan de Plasencia, a pioneer Franciscan missionary in the Philippines. Loarca and the Canon Lawyer Antonio de Morga, who classified society into three estates (ruler, ruled, slave), also affirmed the preeminence of the principales. All members of this first estate (the datu class) were principales whether they were actually occupying positions to rule or not. The Real Academia Espa√±ola defines Principal as, \\"A person or thing that holds first place in value or importance, and is given precedence and preference before others\\". This Spanish term best describes the first estate of the society in the archipelago, which the Europeans came in contact with. San Buenaventura's 1613 Dictionary of the Tagalog language defines three terms that clarify the concept of principal√≠a: # Poon or Pun√≤ (chief, leader) ‚Äì principal or head of a lineage. # Ginoo ‚Äì a noble by lineage and parentage, family and descent. # Maguinoo ‚Äì principal in lineage or parentage. The Spanish term Se√±or (lord) is equated with all these three terms, which are distinguished from the nouveau riche imitators scornfully called maygintao (man with gold or hidalgo by wealth, and not by lineage). The first estate was the class that constituted a birthright aristocracy with claims to respect, obedience, and support from those of subordinate status. =The local nobility and the Laws of the Indies= After conquering Manila and making it the capital of the colonial government in 1571, Miguel Lopez de Legaspi noted that aside from the rulers of Cebu and of the capital, the other principales existing in the Archipelago were either heads or Datus of the barangays allied as nations; or tyrants, who were respected only by the law of the strongest. From this system of the law of the strongest sprung intestinal wars with which certain dominions annihilate one another. Attentive to these existing systems of government without stripping these ancient sovereigns of their legitimate rights, Legaspi demanded from these local rulers vassalage to the Spanish Crown. On June 11, 1594, shortly before confirming Legaspi's erection of Manila as a city on 24 June of the same year, King Philip II issued a Royal Decree institutionalizing the recognition of the rights and privileges of the local ruling class of the Philippines, which was later included in the codification of the Recopilaci√≥n de las leyes de los reynos de Las Indias. In Book VI, Title VII (dedicated to the caciques) of the Recopilaci√≥n de las leyes de los reynos de Las Indias, (Laws of the Indies) there are three very interesting laws insofar as they determined the role that the caciques were to play in the Indian new social order under the colonial rule. With these laws, the Spanish Crown officially recognized the rights of these principales of pre-Hispanic origin. Specifically, Laws 1, 2 (dedicated to American territories) and; Law 16, instituted by Philip II, on June 11, 1594 which is similar to the previous two, with the main purpose of assuring that the principales of the Philippines would be treated well and be entrusted with some government charge. Likewise, this provision extended to the Filipino caciques all policies concerning the Indian caciques under the Spanish rule. King Philip II of Spain by Titian. In order to implement a system of indirect rule in the Philippines, King Philip II ordered, through this law of , that the honors and privileges of governing, which were previously enjoyed by the local royalty and nobility in formerly sovereign principalities who later accepted the catholic faith and became subject to him, should be retained and protected. He also ordered the Spanish governors in the Philippines to treat these native nobles well. The king further ordered that the natives should pay to these nobles the same respect that the inhabitants accorded to their local Lords before the conquest without prejudice to the things that pertain to the king himself or to the encomenderos. The royal decree says: \\"It is not right that the Indian chiefs of Filipinas be in a worse condition after conversion; rather they should have such treatment that would gain their affection and keep them loyal, so that with the spiritual blessings that God has communicated to them by calling them to His true knowledge, the temporal blessings may be added, and they may live contentedly and comfortably. Therefore, we order the governors of those islands to show them good treatment and entrust them, in our name, with the government of the Indians, of whom they were formerly lords. In all else the governors shall see that the chiefs are benefited justly, and the Indians shall pay them something as a recognition, as they did during the period of their paganism, provided this is without prejudice to the tributes that are to be paid us, or to that which pertains to their encomenderos.\\"A printed copy of the Laws of the Indies in the original Spanish language, showing Philip II's Decree of 11 June 1594. Through this law, the local Filipino nobles (under the supervision of the Spanish colonial officials) became encomenderos (trustees) also of the King of Spain, who ruled the country indirectly through these nobles. Corollary to this provision, all existing doctrines and laws regarding the Indian caciques were extended to Filipino principales. Their domains became selfruled tributary barangays of the Spanish Empire. The system of indirect government helped in the pacification of the rural areas, and institutionalized the rule and role of an upper class, referred to as the \\"principal√≠a\\" or the \\"principales\\", until the fall of the Spanish regime in the Philippines in 1898. The Spanish dominion brought serious modifications to the life and economy of the indigenous society. The shift of emphasis to agriculture marginalized, weakened, and deprived the hildalgolike warriors of their significance in the barangays, especially in the traderaiding societies in the Visayas (which needed the Vikinglike services of the \\"timawas\\"). By the 1580s, many of these noblemen found themselves reduced to leasing land from their datus. Their military functions were eclipsed by farming. Whatever remained would quickly be disoriented, deflected, and destroyed by the superior military power of Spain. By the end of the 16th century, any claim to Filipino royalty, nobility or hidalgu√≠a had disappeared into a homogenized, Hispanicized and Christianized nobility ‚Äì the principal√≠a. This remnant of the precolonial royal and noble families continued to rule their traditional domain until the end of the Spanish regime. However, there were cases when succession in leadership was also done through election of new leaders (cabezas de barangay), especially in provinces near the Manila where the ancient ruling families lost their prestige and role. It appears that proximity to the seat of colonial Government diminished their power and significance. In distant territories, where the central authority had less control and where order could be maintained without using coercive measures, hereditary succession was still enforced, until Spain lost the archipelago to the Americans. These distant territories remained patriarchal societies, where people retained great respect for the principal√≠a. =The Emergence of the Mestizo Class= The principal√≠a was larger and more influential than the preconquest indigenous nobility. It helped create and perpetuate an oligarchic system in the Spanish colony for more than three hundred years, serving as a link between the Spanish authorities and the local inhabitants. The Spanish colonial government's prohibition for foreigners to own land in the Philippines contributed to the evolution of this form of oligarchy. In some provinces of the Philippines, many Spaniards and foreign merchants intermarried with the rich and landed MalayoPolynesian local nobilities. From these unions, a new cultural group was formed, the mestizo class. Their descendants emerged later to become an influential part of the government, and of the principal√≠a. The increase of population in the Archipelago, as well as the growing presence of Chinese and Mestizos also brought about social changes that necessitated the creation of new members of the principal√≠a for these sectors of Filipino colonial society. In this regard, pertinent laws were promulgated, such as the above-mentioned royal decree issued on (signed in the name of Queen Isabella II by the Minister of the Colonies, Jos√© de la Concha), which indicate certain conditions for promotion to the principal√≠a class, among others, the capacity to speak the Castilian language. The reform also paved way to the creation of authorities among the Chinese guilds in enclaves of big settlements like Manila, on condition that these leaders were Christianized. Furthermore, Chinese Gobernadorcillos were not given jurisdiction over municipal districts. Their jurisdiction was exceptional and they only exercised this over persons belonging to their guilds. =The Royal Cedula of Charles II and the Indigenous Nobles= The emergence of the mestizo class was a social phenomenon not localized in the Philippines, but was also very much present in the American continent. On 22 March 1697, Charles II of Spain issued a Royal Cedula, related to this phenomenon. The Cedula gave distinctions to classes of persons in the social structure of the Crown Colonies, and defined the rights and privileges of colonial functionaries. In doing so, the Spanish Monarch touched another aspect of the colonial society, i.e., the status of indigenous nobles, extending to these indigenous nobles, as well as to their descendants, the preeminence and honors customarily attributed to the Hidalgos of Castile. The Royal Cedula stipulates: Charles wearing the robes of the Order of the Golden Fleece, in about 1673, by Juan Carre√±o de Miranda \\"Bearing in mind the laws and orders issued by my Progenies, Their Majesties the Kings, and by myself, I order the good treatment, assistance, protection and defense of the native Indians of America, that they may be taken cared of, maintained, privileged and honored like all other vassals of my Crown and that, in the course of time, the trial and use of them stops. I feel that its timely implementation is very suitable for public good, for the benefit of the Indians and for the service of God and mine. That, consequently, with respect to the Indian mestizos, the Archbishops and Bishops of the Indias are charged by Article 7, Title VII, Book I of the Laws of the Indies, for ordaining priests, being attentive to the qualities and circumstances present, and if some mestizas ask to be religious, they (Bishops) shall give support to those whom they admit in monasteries and for vows. But in particular, with regard to the requirements for Indians in order to accede to ecclesiastical or secular, governmental, political and military positions, which all require purity of blood and, by its Statute, the condition of nobility, there is distinction between the Indians and mestizos, inasmuch as there is between the [1] descendants of the notable Indians called caciques, and [2] those who are issues of less notable Indian tributaries, who in their pagan state acknowledged vassalage. It is deemed that all preeminence and honors, customarily conferred on the Hijosdalgos of Castile, are to be attributed to the first and to their descendants, both ecclesiastical and secular; and that they can participate in any communities which, by their statutes require nobility; for it is established that these, in their heathenism, were nobles to whom their subordinates acknowledged vassalage and to whom tributes were paid. Such kind of nobility is still retained and acknowledged, keeping these as well as their privileges wherever possible, as recognized and declared by the whole section on the caciques, which is Title VII, Book VI of the Laws of the Indies, wherein for the sake of distinction, the subordinate Indians were placed under (these noble‚Äôs) dominion called ¬´cacicazgo¬ª, transmissible from elder to elder, to their posteriority‚Ä¶\\" The Royal Cedula was enforced in the Philippines and benefited many indigenous nobles. It can be seen very clearly and irrefutably that, during the colonial period, indigenous chiefs were equated with the Spanish Hidalgos, and the most resounding proof of the application of this comparison is the General Military Archive in Segovia, where the qualifications of \\"Nobility\\" (found in the Service Records) are attributed to those Filipinos who were admitted to the Spanish Military Academies and whose ancestors were caciques, encomenderos, notable Tagalogs, chieftains, governors or those who held positions in the municipal administration or government in all different regions of the large islands of the Archipelago, or of the many small islands of which it is composed. In the context of the ancient tradition and norms of Castilian nobility, all descendants of a noble are considered noble, regardless of fortune. At the Real Academia de la Historia, there is also a substantial amount of records giving reference to the Philippine Islands, and while most part corresponds to the history of these islands, the Academia did not exclude among its documents the presence of many genealogical records. The archives of the Academia and its royal stamp recognized the appointments of hundreds of natives of the Philippines who, by virtue of their social position, occupied posts in the administration of the territories and were classified as \\"Nobles\\". The presence of these notables demonstrates the cultural concern of Spain in those Islands to prepare the natives and the collaboration of these in the government of the Archipelago. This aspect of Spanish rule in the Philippines appears much more strongly implemented than in the Americas. Hence in the Philippines, the local Nobility, by reason of charge accorded to their social class, acquired greater importance than in the Indies of the New World. =The Christianized Filipino Nobles under the Spanish Crown= An 1855 municipal election report in the towns of Banate, Ajuy, Barotac Viejo and Anilao, Iloilo, which the principales exclusively participated in. With the recognition of the Spanish monarchs came the privilege of being addressed as Don or Do√±a.  a mark of esteem and distinction in Europe reserved for a person of noble or royal status during the colonial period. Other honors and high regard were also accorded to the Christianized Datus by the Spanish Empire. For example, the Gobernadorcillos (elected leader of the Cabezas de Barangay or the Christianized Datus) and Filipino officials of justice received the greatest consideration from the Spanish Crown officials. The colonial officials were under obligation to show them the honor corresponding to their respective duties. They were allowed to sit in the houses of the Spanish Provincial Governors, and in any other places. They were not left to remain standing. It was not permitted for Spanish Parish Priests to treat these Filipino nobles with less consideration. The Gobernadorcillos exercised the command of the towns. They were Port Captains in coastal towns. They also had the rights and powers to elect assistants and several lieutenants and alguaciles, proportionate in number to the inhabitants of the town. On the day on which the gobernadorcillo would take on government duties, his town would hold a grand celebration. A festive banquet would be offered in the municipal or city hall where he would occupy a seat, adorned by the coat of arms of Spain and with fanciful designs, if his social footing was of a respectable antiquity. On holy days the town officials would go to the church, together in one group. The principal√≠a and cuadrilleros (police patrol or assistance) formed two lines in front of the Gobernadorcillo. They would be preceded by a band playing the music as they process towards the church, where the Gobernadorcillo would occupy a seat in precedence among those of the chiefs or cabezas de barangay, who had benches of honor. After the mass, they would usually go to the parish rectory to pay their respects to the parish priest. Then, they would return to the tribunal (municipal hall or city hall) in the same order, and still accompanied by the band playing a loud double quick march called paso doble. The gobernadorcillo was always accompanied by an alguacil or policia (police officer) whenever he went about the streets of his town. Certain class symbols At the later part of the Spanish period, this class of elite Christian landowners started to adopt a characteristic style of dress and carry regalia. They wore a distinctive type of salakot, a Philippine headdress commonly used in the archipelago since the precolonial period. Instead of the usual headgear made of rattan, of reeds called Nit√≥, or of various shells such as capiz shells, which common Filipinos would wear, the principales would use more prized materials like tortoise shell. The special salakot of the ruling upper class was often adorned with ornate capping spike crafted in metals of value like silver,Manuel Buzeta y Felipe Bravo, Diccionario geografico, estadistico, historico de las Islas Filipinas, Charleston, South Carolina: 2011, Nabu Press, Vol. I, p. 241. or, at times, gold. This headgear was usually embossed also with precious metals and sometimes decorated with silver coins or pendants that hung around the rim. It was mentioned earlier that the royalties and nobilities of the Pre-colonial societies in the Visayas, Northern Mindanao, and Luzon (Cebu, Bohol Panay, Mindoro and Manila) also shared the many customs of royalties and nobles in Southeast Asian territories (with Hindu and Buddhist cultures), especially in the generous use of gold and silk in their costumes, as the Boxer Codex demonstrate. The measure of the prince's possession of gold and slaves was proportionate to his greatness and nobility.Cf. Report of the Franciscan Fray Letona to Fray Diego Zapata, high Official of the Franciscan Order and of the Inquisition in Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson, The Philippine Islands (1493-1898), Cleveland: The A.H. Clark Company, 1903, Vol. XXIX, p. 281. When the Spaniards reached the shores of the Archipelago, they observed that there was hardly any \\"Indian\\" who did not possess chains and other articles of gold.Cf. Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson, The Philippine Islands (1493-1898), Cleveland: The A.H. Clark Company, 1905, Vol. XXXVI, p. 201. However, this way of dressing was slowly changed as colonial power took firmer grips of the local nobilities and finally ruled the Islands. By the middle of the 19th century, the Principal√≠a's usual attire was black jacket, European trousers, salakot and colored (velvet) slippers. Many would even wear varnished shoes, such as high quality leather shoes. Their shirt was worn outside the trousers. Some sources say that the Spaniards did not allow the native Filipinos to tuck their shirts under their waistbands, nor were they allowed to have any pockets. It was said that the intention of the colonizers was to remind the natives that they remain indios regardless of the wealth and power they attain. It was a way for discriminating the natives from their Spanish overlords. The locals also used native fabrics of transparent appearance. It is believed that transparent, sheer fabric were mainly for discouraging the Indios from hiding any weapons under their shirts. However, the native nobles did not wish to be outdone in the appearance of their apparel. And so, they richly embroidered their shirts with somewhat baroque designs on delicate Pi√±a fabric. This manner of sporting what originally was a European attire for men led the way to the development of the Barong, which later became the national costume for Filipino men.History of Barong Tagalog Distinctive staffs of office were associated with the Filipino ruling class. The Gobernadorcillo would carry a tasseled cane (baston) decorated with precious metals, while his lieutenants would use some kind of wands referred to as \\"Vara (rama)\\". On occasions and ceremonies of greater solemnity, they would dress formally in frock coat and high crowned hat. Questions on Race and Politics, and the Revolution for Independence Spanish Prime Minister of Filipino descent. Although the principal√≠a had many privileges, there were limitations to how much power they were entitled to under Spanish rule. A member of the principal√≠a could never become the GovernorGeneral (Gobernador y Capit√°n General), nor could he become the provincial governor (alcalde mayor).Hypothetically, a member of the principal√≠a could obtain the position of provincial governor if, for example, a noblewoman of the principal√≠a married a Spanish man born in the Philippines (an Insular ) of an elevated social rank. In which case her children would be classified as white (or blanco). However, this did not necessarily give a guarantee that her sons would obtain the position of provincial governor. Being mestizos was not an assurance that they would be loyal enough to the Spanish crown. Such unquestionable allegiance was necessary for the colonizers in retaining control of the archipelago. The children born of the union between the principales and the insulares, or better still, the peninsulares (a Spanish person born in Spain) are neither assured access to the highest position of power in the colony.Emerson Salvador, Liberalism in the Philippines, The Revolution of 1898 : The Main Facts (Article published in the Newsletter of the Society of St. Pius X, District of Asia), Jan -Mar 2002. Flexibility is known to have occurred in some cases, including that of Marcelo Azc√°rraga Palmero who even became interim Prime Minister of Spain on August 8, 1897 until October 4 of that same year. Azc√°rraga also went on to become Prime Minister of Spain again in two more separate terms of office. In 1904, he was granted Knighthood in the very exclusive Spanish chilvalric Order of the Golden Fleece ‚Äî the only mestizo recipient of this prestigious award.List of Knights of the Golden Fleece Ilongga-Spanish mestiza (mixedrace) woman belonging to the principal√≠a. In the archipelago, however, most often ethnic segregation did put a stop to social mobility, even for members of the principal√≠a ‚Äì a thing that is normally expected in a colonial rule. It was not also common for principales to be too ambitious so as to pursue very strong desire for obtaining the office of Governor-General. For most part, it appears that the local nobles were inclined to be preoccupied with matters concerning their barangays and towns. The town mayors received an annual salary of 24 pesos, which was nothing in comparison to the provincial governor's 1,600 pesos and the GovernorGeneral's 40,000 pesos. Even though the gobernadorcillo's salary was not subject to tax, it was not enough to carry out all the required duties expected of such a position. This explains why among the principales, those who had more wealth were likely to be elected to the office of gobernadorcillo (municipal governor). Principales tend to marry those who belong to their class, to maintain wealth and power. However, unlike most European royalties who marry their close relatives, e.g. first cousins, for this purpose, Filipino nobles abhorred incestuous unions. In some cases, members of the principalia married wealthy and nonnoble Chinese (Sangley) merchants, who made their fortune in the colony. Principales born of these unions had possibilities to be elected gobernadorcillo by their peers. Filipino Chinese family, c. 1880. Wealth was not the only basis for intermarriage between the principales and foreigners, which were commonly prearranged by parents of the bride and groom. Neither did having a Spaniard as one of the parents of a child ennobles him. In a traditionally conservative Catholic environment with Christian mores and norms strictly imposed under the tutelage and prying eyes of Spanish friars, marriage to a divorc√©e or secondhand spouse (locally referred to as \\"tir√° ng ib√°\\", literally \\"others' leftovers\\") was scornfully disdained by Filipino aristocrats. Virgin brides were a must for the principal√≠a, as well as for the Filipinos in general. Children who were born outside of marriage, even of Spaniards, were not accepted in the circle of principales. These were severely ostracized in the conservative colonial society and were pejoratively called an \\"an√°k sa lab√°s\\", i.e., \\"child from outside\\" (viz., outside marriage), a stigma that still remains part of the contemporary social mores.Julliane Love De Jesus, Bill seeks to omit ‚Äòlegitimate, illegitimate‚Äô children in Family Code in Inquirer.Net (21 September 2013). During the last years of the regime, there were efforts to push for a representation of the archipelago in the Spanish Cortes among a good number of principales. This move was prevalent especially among those who have studied in Spain and other parts of Europe (Ilustrados). That initiative, however, was met with snobbery by the colonizers, who denied the natives of equal treatment, in any way possible. Towards the end of the 19th century, civil unrest occurred more frequently. This situation was exposed by the writer and leader of the Propaganda Movement, Jos√© Rizal, in his two novels: Noli Me T√°ngere, and El Filibusterismo (dedicated to the three Filipino Catholic priests, who were executed on 17 February 1872 by Spanish colonial authorities, on charges of subversion arising from the 1872 Cavite mutiny). Because of this growing unrest that turned into an irreversible revolution, the position of provincial governor became awarded more and more often to the peninsulares. In the ecclesiastical sector, a decree was made, stating there were to be no further appointments of Filipinos as parish priests. Status quaestionis Heraldic Crown of Hispanic Hidalgos. Visayan royal couple in yellow gold, blue and red, the distinctive colours of the Datu class. Illustration by an unknown Chinese artist c. 1595 in Boxer Codex. The recognition of the rights and privileges of the Filipino Principal√≠a as equivalent to those of the Hidalgos of Castile appears to facilitate entrance of Filipino nobles into institutions under the Spanish Crown, either civil or religious, which required proofs of nobility. However, such approximation may not be entirely correct since in reality, although the principales were vassals of the Spanish Crown, their rights as sovereign in their former dominions were guaranteed by the Laws of the Indies, more particularly the Royal Decree of Philip II of 11 June 1594, which Charles II confirmed for the purpose stated above, in order to satisfy the requirements of the existing laws in the Peninsula. From the beginning of the Spanish colonial period, the conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legaspi retained the hereditary rights of the local ancient sovereigns of the Archipelago who vowed allegiance to the Spanish Crown. Many of them accepted the Catholic religion and became Spanish allies at this time. He only demanded from these local rulers vassalage to the Spanish Crown, replacing the similar overlordship, which previously existed in a few cases, e.g., Sultanate of Brunei's overlordship of the Kingdom of Maynila. Other independent polities, which were not vassals to other States, e.g., Confederation of Madja-as and the Rajahnate of Cebu, were de facto Protectorates/Suzerainties having had alliances with the Spanish Crown before the Kingdom took total control of most parts of the Archipelago. A question remains after the cessession of Spanish rule in the Philippines regarding any remaining rank equivalency of Filipino Principal√≠a. Reassuming their ancestral titles as Datus while retaining the Hidalgu√≠a of Castile (their former protector state), as subsidiary title, is the logical consequence of the above-mentioned recognition by Charles II of Spain. As guaranteed by this Spanish Monarch's Royal Decree, the ancient nobility of the casiques within his realm (which includes the Filipino Principales) \\"is still retained and acknowledged\\". Besides, the principales retained many of the ordinary obligations of local rulers as manifested in constructing local infrastructures and in maintaining the government offices without funds from Spain. Expenditures of the local government came from the private and personal resources of the principales. These were not taxes that citizens were obliged to pay as tributes required by their Spanish Crown from its subjects. In many ways, the principales retained much of the responsibilities, powers and obligations of the pre-colonial Datus ‚Äî their predecessors, except for the right to organize their own armed forces. Only the right of Gobernadorcillos to appoint alguacils and \\"cuadrilleros\\" (police patrol or assistance) seem to point out to some kind of vestige of this pre-colonial sign of the Datu's coercive power and responsibility to defend his domain. Like deposed royal families elsewhere in the world, which continue to claim hereditary rights as pretenders to the former thrones of their ancestors, the descendants of the Principal√≠a have similar claims to the historical domains of their forebears.Valynseele, Joseph.

It has simple, elliptical leaves, small groups of flowers in leaf axils and more or less spherical fruit. The aromatic and acidic fruit is harvested as a bushfood. Description Acronychia acidula is a tree that typically grows to a height of about . It has simple, elliptical, glabrous leaves that are long and wide on a petiole long. The crushed leaves often have an odour resembling that of mango (Mangifera indica). The flowers are arranged in groups long, in leaf axils or between the leaves, each flower on a glabrous pedicel long. The four sepals are long and the four petals long. The eight stamens alternate in length. The fruit is a fleshy, more or less spherical drupe long and the seeds are about long. Taxonomy Acronychia acidula was first formally described in 1864 by Victorian state botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae from specimens collected by John Dallachy in the Seaview Range near Rockingham Bay. Its species name acidula is Latin \\"slightly acid\\". Distribution and habitat Lemon aspen grows in rainforest at altitudes of up to from the Atherton Tableland to the Eungella Range in Queensland. Ecology The fruit are eaten by the topknot pigeon (Lopholaimus antarcticus). Uses Lemon aspen fruit has a grapefruit and lime-like flavor, and is popular in beverages, sauces and confectionery. The fruit has high antioxidant activity. Cultivation The tree is grown in small-scale commercial bushfood orchards on the east coast of Australia from North Queensland to northern New South Wales. The tree is quick-growing and requires regular pruning to maintain a practical harvesting height. It has a moderate crop yield, and bears in four years from seedlings. It prefers well- drained and fertile clay loam soils, with a sunny aspect and extra moisture when young. Cultural references Lemon aspen featured on an Australian postage stamp in 2019.

It is sung to a version of the family of tunes later used for \\"Sam Hall\\", \\"Captain Kidd\\", and \\"Admiral John Benbow\\", which according to Roy Palmer was first printed in 1714.

Constructed under the Works Progress Administration as part of President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, it functioned as a Veterans Administration Hospital until 1966 when it was sold to the state of Ohio. The Broadview Developmental Center was then converted into a psychiatric hospital, and remained open until 1993 when the prevailing opinion on mental health shifted from institutional care to community-based care, and the hospital lost its funding. The building was demolished in 2006, except for its newest portion, which was kept as the city of Broadview Heights' city hall and recreation centre. Broadview Veterans Administration Hospital The hospital originally opened in 1939, under the control of the United States Veterans Administration. While it performed traditional functions by caring for the numerous veterans of World War II, it also served as housing for victims of tuberculosis. Because the disease was highly contagious, most infected persons were separated from the general public. They were often entered into sanitaria such as Broadview, where they could be cared for without threat to the at-large population. Designed to be self-sufficient, the campus included a full cafeteria and kitchen, dental offices, a beauty shop, and a chapel. It also included small cottages on the property, where patients who required less supervision were housed. Separate wards were built for children and maternity patients. This minimized contact between patients and the outside world, thus reducing risk of infection. Most of the staff had offices on campus. With the discovery of Streptomycin in 1946, the usefulness of these facilities began to wane. The antibiotic proved a potent treatment for tuberculosis, significantly reducing the risk of widespread contagion. This limited Broadview Hospital's use to the federal government, which sold the facility to the state of Ohio in 1966. Broadview Developmental Center The state government promptly converted the hospital into a psychiatric institution for patients with mental retardation and other developmental handicaps. It operated without major incident for nearly three decades, avoiding major controversy despite the general climate of abuse and misconduct that hung over mental health institutions at the time. The hospital's almost closed doors in 1989 when could not maintain its ICF/MR license for mental health treatment. The administration applied for a four-year extension which was granted. Broadview Developmental Center, the most recent closure, could not maintain ICF/MR certification. Legislation was introduced in 1989 to keep the center open for four years till 1993 to obtain Medicaid certification.[www.equipforequality.org/publications/cipp_final.doc] Like many other psychiatric institutions, the Broadview Developmental Center became a victim of deinstitutionalization. Backlash against social welfare programs, combined with the increasing availability of antidepressants and other psychiatric drugs, led to significant cuts in federal and state mental health spending. The majority of the hospital's patients were transferred into community-based programs, and the hospital closed in 1993. Abandonment/Deinstitutionalization The building was abandoned almost immediately. Large amounts of medical and office equipment were left within, personal artifacts belonging to former staff and patients, and numerous filing cabinets filled with patient records. The abandonment caused a large amount of controversy, as the majority of former patients had been released to community-based organizations (most residents did not have any family what so ever), and all records of their treatment, progress, and illness have been lost in the subsequent clean-up and renovation. Broadview became a popular target for vandalism, and also attracted paranormal investigators as rumors began to surface that the facility was haunted by former patients. Its windows were boarded and the city erected a chain-link fence to keep out would-be explorers. General Assembly voted to sell Broadview Center to the City of Broadview Heights. In the Broadview closure, the local County Board of MR/DD, Cuyahoga County, developed the community alternatives, and community outcomes were improved. In the Broadview closure, parents were active stakeholders in a state-sponsored Oversight Committee, and they helped to establish the criteria for what was needed to support their son or daughter in the community. Early 2006 DemolitionEarly 2006 Demolition It remained in this condition until 1995, when the general Assembly voted to sell Broadview Center to the City of Broadview Heights. The city of Broadview Heights purchased the Developmental Center from the state of Ohio for $750,000. The city tore down many of the outlying structures including the cottages, and built a new police station on the grounds. The building was partially renovated and transformed into a community center with an indoor swimming pool and recreational facilities. During the renovation, city inspectors discovered a significant asbestos threat, forcing a temporary delay in construction while the hazardous substance was removed. Transition and Community Living The transition plans for residents of Broadview were highly individualized. The resident and his or her family/guardian were involved in the service plan development. The Cuyahoga County Board worked in conjunction with the staff at the institution. A resident or family member/guardian could refuse a prospective placement and request another one or have the option of transferring to another institution. After establishing the criteria for what was required to meet client needs, Broadview asked for a Request for Proposals from the community to develop services to meet specific needs. It took almost two years to move all residents to the community. A majority of the residents went to new eight-bed Intermediate Care Facilities (ICF/MR) that were created at that time. Another large number of residents went to congregate living dwellings, operated by community vendors, with six or fewer beds. Four areas identified as being the hardest services or needs to fill in the community are: # transportation ‚Äì in addition, the providers complain that they don‚Äôt receive adequate reimbursement for this service; # dental; # maintaining quality direct support staff; and # insufficient quantity of some specialty support staff, such as physical and occupational therapists. Demolition After the building was cleared of asbestos, further city construction projects were approved for the community grounds. The grounds adjacent to the Broadview Developmental Center, which is home to Broadview Heights' city hall (since 1999) is maintained. The Broadview Developmental Center was scheduled for demolition in early 2001, but financial troubles in the city government forced delays. A no-interest government loan was secured in 2003 and the demolition process began in early 2006. The city plans to expand the recreation center, and develop the campus into a center for municipal government.

Synopsis In the middle of a wilderness, a beautiful mountain bore trees and waterfalls, but whoever left the road for it never returned. A king advised his seven sons wisely, but no sooner had he died than his oldest son resolved to set out for the enchanted mountain. One after the other his sons departed for the mountain and never returned, until only the youngest remained, now king. Soon the craving to seek the mountain overcame him. The young king reached the mountain and was drawn away from his attendants by a deer which he could not catch; when he returned, he found all his men dead or dying of poison at their camp. He hid in the tree and saw a youth approaching. This youth had servants dispose of the bodies and lead off the horses, but realized that there were one more horses than bodies and asked who owned the final horse. The young king leaped down and claimed ownership of the horse, challenging the youth to battle in revenge for his fallen brothers and servants‚Äîfor surely this youth had caused his elder brothers to never return from the mountain. The youth told the king he accepted the challenge and he was to follow him, Zoulvisia. When the youth mounted his horse and rode away, the young king realized that the youth had been a woman all along. He set out to find her house. He came to three cottages, in each of which a fairy lived with her son. They urged him not to pursue Zoulvisia. He gave them a mirror, a pair of scissors, and a razor, telling them that if blood appeared on them, they should come to his aid. Upon finding Zoulvisia's palace, he found an old man trapped in a pit outside the palace walls, who told him that Zoulvisia kept him prisoner there. He told how Zoulvisia could look over all her lands at sunrise, but if he hid in a certain cave, protecting it with a stick, he would survive and could come out on her third cry, having broken her power. He did that, and Zoulvisia admitted he had defeated her. She became his wife, freed the old man, and gave him her magical fiery horse. One day, he hunted, having received a case of pearls with one of Zoulvisia's hair, and a stag led him far, and he lost the case in a river without realizing it. It was swept downstream, and a watercarrier found it and brought it to the wicked king of that land. Struck by its wealth and the beauty of the golden hair within the case, the wicked king demanded the chamberlain discover its secrets or the chamberlain would lose his head. In a fright, the chamberlain sought any who could explain the case and an old woman told the chamberlain that it belonged to a beautiful woman named Zoulvisia. The chamberlain told her that if she brought him Zoulvisia, he would give her more gold. An old witch set off and arrived, on a raft, just as the king prepared to return to his wife from a day of hunting. He offered to help the witch, but his horse would not let him take her up, for it sensed her wickedness; she guessed why and said she feared falling off, so she would walk. When they arrived at the palace, the witch ingratiated herself with Zoulvisia's servants until the young queen trusted her. The witch persuaded Zoulvisia that her husband must be keeping a secret from her, the secret of his strength, and that he did not love her unless he would share it. Zoulvisia believed, and plead with her husband to know his secret, so that she would be sure that he loved her. He confessed the secret of his strength, a sabre that never left his side. To prove that her husband did indeed love her, Zoulvisia ran at once and confessed the secret to the witch, exactly as the witch had planned. The witch stole the sabre, struck the king down with poisonous snakes, and kidnapped Zoulvisia to sell the beautiful young queen to the wicked king. The fairies' sons saw that something had happened to the young king. They went to his castle and could not find the sabre. They caught fish to eat, and a great fish thrashed in the water because it had eaten the sabre. They brought it to the king, who recovered. He set out on Zoulvisia's fiery horse. He found the place where the wicked king was going to marry Zoulvisia, though Zoulvisia greatly resisted him and wished to escape to her beloved husband. The young king had an old beggar woman bring his ring to Zoulvisia. She told the beggar woman to tell the wicked king that Zoulvisia had come to her senses and would marry him, and to tell the man who gave the ring to await her in a garden in three days. The wicked king loosened the guard on her, and she went to the gardens on the day of her supposed wedding, unattended by the wicked king's guards. There, with a flash of fire and crack of thunder, the young king rode down on his fiery horse and rescued Zoulvisia, returning them both to her palace by the river to live happily ever after.

It stands on a difficult-to-access and steep promontory above the confluence of the Vltava and Otava rivers. The castle is one of the most important early-Gothic castles in Czech lands. The area was inhabited as early as prehistoric times, when the Celts built a fort here in the 1st century AD. The current castle was built in the first half of the 13th century, most probably on the orders of King P≈ôemysl Otakar I, but the exact date is not known. The first written mention of the castle comes from year 1234 and owned by the Kings of Bohemia. History Zv√≠kov gatehouse and tower Originally a small complex, the castle was continuously extended until 1278. After the P≈ôemyslid dynasty died out in 1306, Zv√≠kov became property of the Ro≈æmberk family. After 1337 the settlement under the castle has been fortified, as a part of thorough repairs. Its fortifications were so strong that even the Hussites, during the Hussite Wars, besieged it for four months in 1429, but found it a tough nut to crack and failed to take it. To protect against heavy artillery its walls were further strengthened. Although Emperor Charles IV placed it on a list of royal castles not to be pawned, his successors ignored his decree and by 1431 it was in the possession of the Ro≈æmberk dynasty. At the start of Thirty Years' War Zv√≠kov was owned by a rebellious Protestant nobleman whose garrison of 140 men successfully defended the castle against 4,000 Habsburg troops in 1618.Neal Bedford, Jane Rawson, Matt Warren, Czech & Slovak Republics, pg. 238, Lonely Planet Publications 4th ed. (2004), The defendants agreed to capitulate to the Emperor's forces only in October 1622. Subsequently, it was looted and devastated. During the 1640s the ≈†vanberks modified the palace and extended it in Renaissance style. After the damaged inflicted by the war, Zv√≠kov was restored, but its glory was long gone and the castle served only for farming purposes. A fire accelerated the deterioration of its buildings in 1751. Thus a once-important seat of Czech kings it had become an almost ruin by the 1840s, at which time the Schwarzenbergs, owners of the ruin, invested huge sums in a thorough reconstruction, which restored the heart of the castle to its former glory. At the end of 17th century it ceased to have military value and was used as granary. The decline continued and in 1751 fire damaged a large part of the palace. In 1780 the chapel was deconsecrated. The facade of the palace collapsed in 1829 and between 1880 and 1902 the castle was reconstructed, only to be confiscated by the state in 1947. The Orl√≠k Dam, which was built between 1954 and 1962 and named after Orl√≠k Castle, deluged the castle downtown and made Zv√≠kov easily accessible. Major restorations between 1970 and 1980 concentrated on the palace. Description Courtyard of Zv√≠kov Castle The oldest part of Zv√≠kov is a massive prismatic residential tower named Hl√≠zov√° with palace buildings built on its sides. During the reign of Ottokar II of Bohemia, a palace named Kr√°lovsk√Ω (King's Own) was built and this ground plan has been preserved until today. The new palace was built in lavish style and its parts were connected by monumental arcade. After 1473, Bohuslav of Svamberk commissioned mural decorations in the Chapel of St. Wenceslaus, which belongs to the masterpieces of early-gothic Czech architecture. The walls display the patron saints of Bohemia, the Virgin Mary the Protector, the Suffering Christ and the Martyrdom of St. Erasmus. The fortification was extended with Hl√°ska, large high tower (bergfrit) on the south side. The castle has two gates. The castle has its own ghost, Zv√≠kov's imp,Mirka Zemanov√°, Jan√°ƒçek, pg. 246, Northeastern (2002), and had inspired several painters and writers like the theatrical comedy Zv√≠kovsk√Ω rar√°≈°ek by Ladislav Stroupe≈ænick√Ω.

He studied at the Czech Technical University in Prague from 1925 to 1931, after which he came to Tallinn to become one of the most important local designers of modern dwellings. His early-1930s creation based on the simple rules of functionalistic architecture, while in the latter part of the decade, more influence of art deco appeared. Sacharias has created a number of small villas, big apartment buildings and even a few small churches. He fled from Estonia in 1941 in fear of Soviet terror, and spent the following eight years in Germany (living in Werneck, Berlin, and Gleiwitz in Eastern Germany), where he continued to work as an architect. In January 1945 he fled with his family from the approaching Russian troops back to Werneck, where he lived until 1949. He then moved to Adelaide, Australia, where he managed to create his own architecture bureau and carry on as an architect.

Deshin Shekpa was born in Nyang Dam in the south of Tibet. According to the legend he said after being born: \\"I am the Karmapa. Om mani padme hum shri.\\" Deshin Shekpa was taken to Tsawa Phu who recognized him as the reincarnation of the Karmapa. Deshin traveled extensively through Tibet and Mongolia and taught people about non-violence. After having finished his education, he was invited in 1403 by the emperor, because Emperor Zhu Di, the Yongle Emperor, (1402‚Äì1424) had a vision of Avalokitesvara. He also required religious ceremonies to be held for his deceased parents. After a long journey beginning in 1403, he arrived in Nanjing, the then capital on April 10, 1407 on an elephant, at the imperial palace, where tens of thousands of monks greeted him. He convinced the emperor that there were different Buddhist branches for different people and that does not mean that one branch is better than the other. The Karmapa was very well received during his visit to the capital and a number of miraculous occurrences are reported. He also performed ceremonies for the emperor's family. The emperor presented him with 700 measures of silver objects and bestowed the title of 'Precious Religious King, Great Loving One of the West, Mighty Buddha of Peace'. He also gave him a material representation of the famous and ethereal 'Vajra Crown' which was said to be invisible to all except those of most pure spirit.

Benny grew up at the Jesse Lee Home for Children in Unalaska and later in Seward.  Fox Farm  After graduating from college in 1932, Benny left the Jesse Lee Home. He returned to the Aleutian Islands to work with his father at the Fox Farm in Ugaiushak Island. The rate for furs began to decline, so Benny moved to Seattle in 1936. He used the $1,000 prize from the flag design competition to enroll in the Hemphill Diesel Engineering School for Diesel engine repair. In 1938, Benson married Betty Van Hise. The couple's first child, Anna May, was born in October 1938. Their second daughter, Charlotte Abbot, was born in June 1940. Benson divorced in 1950 and moved with his daughters to Kodiak where he became an airplane mechanic for Kodiak Airways.  Later years and death  Benny met his sister in the mid 1950s, 30 years after their separation. His sister died soon after. His brother Carl also died in 1965. Benson's right leg had to be amputated in 1969 due to an injury. Shortly after that, in 1972, he met and married a former Jesse Lee Home resident, Anna Sophie Jenks. Benson had several stepchildren and grandchildren. He died of a heart attack in Kodiak, Alaska, on July 2 of that year, at the age of 58.Alaska State Flag and Song Intertwined Around Benny Benson, Part 3 Flag design 32 years before Alaska was to become a state, the Alaska Department of the American Legion sponsored a territorial contest for Alaskan children from seventh grade (12-13 year old students) to twelfth grade (17-18 year old students). Benny's design was chosen to represent the future of the Alaska Territory. Up to that time, Alaskans had flown only the U.S. flag since the territory was purchased from Russia in 1867. His design was chosen over roughly 700 other submissions from schoolchildren territory-wide in grades 7 to 12. Most other entries featured variations on the territorial seal, the midnight sun, the northern lights, polar bears, and/or gold pans. For his achievement, Benny was awarded $1,000, an engraved watch and a trip to Washington, D.C. Benny looked to the sky for the symbols he included in his design. Choosing the familiar asterism he looked for every night before going to sleep at the orphanage, he submitted this description with it: Legacy * Mount Benson, a prominent mountain overlooking Seward was named after him in 1974. * Benson Boulevard, a major east-west thoroughfare in midtown Anchorage, was built in the 1970s and named for him. * Benny Benson Memorial is located at Mile 1.4 of the Seward Highway in Seward, Alaska. * On April 11, 2013, in honor of his centenary, the Alaska Legislature passed SB31, which named the airport in Kodiak \\"Kodiak Benny Benson State Airport.\\" * Benny Benson School in Anchorage on Campbell Airstrip Road is an alternative school serving the educational needs of students who have been deemed at risk and is part of the Anchorage School District SEARCH program.

Nicholas Marcellus Hentz circumscribed the genus in 1850, initially as a monospecific genus containing his newly described species S. flavidus. It is very similar to the genus Thwaitesia, and both are similar to Episinus. Unlike Argyrodes, they have two setae in place of a colulus. Specimens of S. flavidus are variable in structure. Only some have an elevated eye region or humps on the anterior of the abdomen. Females of S. gracilis are 3.7mm long, males 2.3mm. A revision of the genus by and colleagues printed in 2018 included the description of fifteen new species, as well as the removal of S. argenteus. Some of the new specific names were named in honor of political figures, artists, and celebrities. As of 2017, when the electronic pre-print was published, Spintharus was the spider genus with the most species named after celebrities. An earlier revision of the genus was by Herbert Walter Levi; his taxonomy recognized two species: S. flavidus and S. gracilis. Species Female S. flavidus (w/o legs). , the World Spider Catalog (WSC), largely following Agnarsson and colleagues, accepts the following extant species: * Spintharus argenteus ‚Äì Pakistan * Spintharus barackobamai ‚Äì Cuba * Spintharus berniesandersi ‚Äì Cuba * Spintharus davidattenboroughi ‚Äì Jamaica * Spintharus davidbowiei ‚Äì Mexico * Spintharus dayleae ‚Äì Saint Lucia, Grenada * Spintharus flavidus (type species) ‚Äì USA, Central and South America * Spintharus frosti ‚Äì Dominican Republic * Spintharus giraldoalayoni ‚Äì Cuba * Spintharus goodbreadae ‚Äì Cuba * Spintharus gracilis ‚Äì Brazil * Spintharus greerae ‚Äì Mexico * Spintharus jesselaueri ‚Äì Dominica * Spintharus leonardodicaprioi ‚Äì Dominican Republic * Spintharus manrayi ‚Äì Cuba * Spintharus michelleobamaae ‚Äì Cuba * Spintharus ralli ‚Äì Puerto Rico, Saint Kitts and Nevis * Spintharus skelly ‚Äì Dominican Republic Although , the WSC accepts S. argenteus as a species, Agnarsson and colleagues argued it to be a nomen dubium or at the very least misplaced in this genus saying it might belong in the family Tetragnathidae.

This led to work in film, including a 90-minute documentary on Penthouse magazine commissioned by its publisher, Bob Guccione. His first feature was The Hard Part Begins, considered to be a classic of early English-Canadian cinema. This was followed by the box-office hit Prom Night, a straightforward slasher film starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen.
