He previously played for the Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, and Cincinnati Reds. Iglesias was an All-Star in 2015. Professional career Defection and minors While in Cuba, Iglesias played with the Habana, from the Cuban National Series. With pitcher Noel Arg√ºelles, Iglesias defected from the Cuban junior national team while in Canada in July 2008. Iglesias signed as an international amateur free agent with the Boston Red Sox in September 2009. Prior to the 2011 season, Iglesias was the sole Red Sox prospect on the MLB.com annual list of top 50 baseball prospects, where he was ranked 42nd. Boston Red Sox (2011‚Äì2013) =2011= In March 2011, Iglesias was optioned to the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox. Iglesias was called up by the Red Sox and made his major league debut on May 8, 2011 as a defensive substitute for Jed Lowrie in the ninth inning of a 9‚Äì5 win over the Minnesota Twins. In the next game, he represented the game-winning run, scoring from first base on a Carl Crawford double in the 11th inning. On May 11, 2011, Iglesias made his first MLB start due to Jed Lowrie being sick. =2012= Boston Red Sox in 2012 Iglesias started the 2012 season in Pawtucket. He was called up to Boston May 1 after an ailing back sidelined Kevin Youkilis, but he did not appear in a game before being sent back down to Triple-A. Iglesias also appeared late in the 2012 season to back up Mike Avil√©s, and hit his first career home run during this stretch. =2013= Entering 2013, Iglesias was ranked as the 10th best prospect in the Red Sox organization, and 96th on the MLB.com Top 100 Prospects list. He started the season in Boston, going 9-for-20 with two doubles and one RBI in six games, but was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket after Stephen Drew was activated on April 10. He was recalled by the Red Sox on May 24 when third baseman Will Middlebrooks was placed on the DL. Iglesias excelled while splitting time between shortstop and third base, remaining in the starting lineup even after Middlebrooks returned from the DL. Despite being known primarily for his defense, Iglesias batted .420 for a stretch of over 100 at-bats after being recalled, including an 18-game hitting streak that was broken on June 19 against the Tampa Bay Rays. For his efforts, he was named the American League Rookie of the Month for June. Iglesias started the 2013 season playing 63 games with a .330 batting average, a home run, and 19 RBIs while with Boston. Detroit Tigers (2013‚Äì2018) =2013= On July 30, Iglesias was traded to the Detroit Tigers in a three-team deal that sent Jake Peavy and Brayan Villarreal to the Boston Red Sox and Avisail Garc√≠a and Francellis Montas to the Chicago White Sox. Iglesias chose jersey No. 1, making him the first Tigers player to wear it since Lou Whitaker retired in 1995. Iglesias drove in a run with a single in his very first game as a Tiger, on August 2, helping Detroit to a 2‚Äì1 win over the White Sox. The next night, he hit his first home run as a Tiger, a solo shot to left field in the fourth inning. Following the 50-game suspension given to Tigers starting shortstop Jhonny Peralta on August 5 for his connections to the South Florida Biogenesis clinic, Iglesias was named the Tigers new everyday shortstop. For the rest of the 2013 season with the Tigers, Iglesias batted .259 with 2 home runs, and 10 RBIs in 46 games. Overall in 2013, Iglesias hit .303 with 3 home runs and 29 RBIs in 109 games combined with both the Red Sox and Tigers. On the field, he committed 6 errors in 357 chances. Regardless of his trade after the All-Star Break, Iglesias was part of the Tigers 25-man active roster for their postseason run. During the postseason, Iglesias batted .231 with an RBI. Iglesias was named the 2013 Detroit Tigers/Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association Rookie of the Year. Iglesias finished second in the American League Rookie of the Year voting in 2013, being edged out by Wil Myers. =2014= On January 8, Iglesias and the Tigers agreed to terms on a one-year contract worth $1.65 million. Although Iglesias is under team control through 2018, his 2014 salary had yet to be determined after the contract he signed with the Red Sox as an amateur free agent expired. Iglesias missed the entire 2014 season due to stress fractures in both of his shins.Tigers rule out Iglesias for 2014 season MLB.com, June 4, 2014 =2015= On July 6, Iglesias was named as a reserve for the American League at the 2015 All-Star Game. On September 5, it was announced that Iglesias suffered a non-displaced small fracture in his right middle finger at the PIP joint after being hit on the hand by a pitch, and the team announced he would be out for at least two weeks. With the Tigers later falling out of the AL Central race, the team elected to not activate him from the DL for the remainder of the season. During the 2015 season, Iglesias posted a .300 batting average in 416 at-bats, with 17 doubles, two home runs and 23 RBIs. =2016= On January 15, 2016, the Tigers avoided arbitration with Iglesias, agreeing on a one-year, $2.1 million contract. Iglesias made one trip to the disabled list in 2016, after suffering a left hamstring strain in August, but still reached career highs with 137 games, 467 at-bats and 26 doubles, and had the lowest strikeout percentage of all major league baseball players (9.7%), as he also had the highest contact percentage on his swings in the major leagues (91.2%).American League Leaderboards ¬ª 2016 ¬ª Batters ¬ª Advanced Statistics  FanGraphs Baseball He finished the season with a .255 batting average, 4 home runs and 32 RBI.

His pioneering investigations of bacterial transformation helped illuminate the mechanisms by which donor DNA enters and is integrated into a host cell. His research also contributed to our understanding of mechanisms of DNA mutation, recombination, and mismatch repair more generally. Ancillary activities include his critical role in the establishment of the Council for a Livable World. He was married to photo researcher Sally Fox, who died in 2006, for over 50 years, and has three sons (Jonathan, Gregory, and Michael). Fox died in January 2020 at the age of 95.Maurice Fox, professor emeritus of biology, dies at 95 Youth and Education Maurice Fox (Maury) was born of poor Russian Jewish immigrants and spent his formative years living in New York City. Like many others of his generation, he benefited from an excellent public school system in which a budding interest in science was fostered from an early age. His study of chemistry began at Stuyvesant High School and, after a brief stint at Queens College, and another as weather forecaster in the U.S. Army Air Force during WWII, culminated in a Ph.D. under Willard Libby at the University of Chicago in 1951. It was at Chicago that he first met, and soon became a disciple, prot√©g√©, friend and colleague of, Le√≥ Szil√°rd. Szil√°rd's biography contains many references to Fox. Szil√°rd recruited him into the small but growing ranks of the new discipline of molecular biology. In 1953, he moved to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research to work in Roland Hotchkiss' group. It was a heady time, in which bright young people, coming from a range of scientific disciplines, were challenged to pose questions about biology on which their diverse skills might be brought to bear. This period has often been referred to as the \\"Golden Age of Molecular Biology,\\" but its particular ethos shaped Fox's research for the next half century, as he continued to pose novel kinds of, and novel approaches to, questions about molecular genetics, about cancer, about adaptive mutation; to insist on the pursuit of unexamined possibilities; and to free and open sharing of ideas with colleagues and students. His life was also marked by an ongoing commitment (shared with Szil√°rd) to nurturing the young, and to fulfilling his particular social and political responsibilities as a scientist. Key Scientific Contributions Maury Fox in his home in 1988 Fox's primary achievement in the early part of his career was to turn bacterial transformation into an experimental model for genetic analysis that was to provide key insights into the mechanisms of genetic modification. Later he was to extend the powerful modes of analysis developed in this early work to the investigation of genetic modification in transduction and conjugation as well. But as important as this work was to our understanding of mutation, recombination, and mismatch repair, perhaps equally important was his lifelong insistence on the critical interrogation of available data, on the posing of alternative possible explanations, and on the design of experiments that could test such alternative interpretations. These habits of inquiry were remarkably productive, both in his own work and in the work of the many others with whom he interacted. Directly or indirectly, it led, e.g., to the search for RNA viruses by Tim Loeb (1961), to the discovery of the SOS response in bacteria by Miroslav Radman (1976), and to the development of techniques of bacterial cell fusion by Pierre Shaeffer (1976). It also led him to a very early challenge (based on critical examination of the epidemiological data on breast cancer) to the prevailing confidence among physicians in the efficacy either of radical mastectomy or of mammograms (1979), and to an equally early recognition of the critical importance of epigenetic changes in the initial stages of carcinogenesis (1980). Social and Political From the start of his career, Fox was attentive to the social and political implications of scientific actively. He was, e.g., concerned about the biological effects of radiation, the dangers of biological warfare, the risks of gene therapy and (later) of genetic recombination, and on all these issues, he was actively involved in efforts to reduce risks and guarantee public safety. He talked to citizen groups, rallied scientists, wrote editorials and letters for Science, and participated in committees. For example, he chaired the Radiation Protection Committee at MIT in the 1960s, and was a member of the International Bioethics Committee of UNESCO from 1998. But what may have been his most important political and social contribution was his role in helping Szil√°rd organize the \\"Council for a Livable World\\" (originally called \\"Council for Abolishing War\\", 1962) and facilitating its operation. This organization served as an early political action committee and was effective in supporting peace candidates for legislative positions throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Selected Honors *1959.

Works and beliefs In her 1993 book The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail, Margaret Starbird developed the hypothesis that Saint Sarah was the daughter of Jesus and Mary Magdalen and that this was the source of the legend associated with the cult at Saintes- Maries-de-la-Mer. She also claimed that the name \\"Sarah\\" meant \\"Princess\\" in Hebrew, thus making her the forgotten child of the \\"sang r√©al\\", the blood royal of the King of the Jews.Margaret Starbird, The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail,pages 60‚Äì62, Bear & Company, 1993.

Starbird believes that the patriarchal Roman Catholic church suppressed the veneration and devotion of the sacred feminine, leading to an unbalanced spirituality in mainstream Christianity. Margaret Starbird has outlined her conviction that \\"Christianity at its inception included the celebration of the Hieros gamos (\\"holy wedding\\") of opposites, a model incarnate in the archetypal bridegroom and his bride ‚Äì Jesus the Christ and the woman called \\"the Magdalen\\". This model of unity, tragically lost in the cradle of Christianity, is patterned on the fundamental blueprint for life on our planet, and manifested in the leadership role played by certain women in the community of Jesus' first followers.\\" Starbird claims this sacred partnership was the same as that which existed in other regions of the Near East that predated Christianity, comparable to the cults of Inanna and Dummuzi, Ishtar and Tammuz ‚Äì being part of a fertility cult that brought well being to its people.Margaret Starbird, Magdalene's Lost Legacy: Symbolic Numbers and The Sacred Union In Christianity, pages 8‚Äì9 (Bear & Co, 2003).

Criticism Although Starbird's works have very little mention of a continuing sacred bloodline of descendants of Jesus and Mary Magdalen which is also a significant portion of the premises behind such books as The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, she did state in The Woman With the Alabaster Jar that \\"there is evidence to suggest that the royal bloodline of Jesus and Mary Magdalen eventually flowed in the veins of the Merovingian monarchs of France\\",Margaret Starbird, Woman With the Alabaster Jar, page 62. and mistakenly claimed that the fleur-de-lys was the royal emblem of Clovis I (c. 466-511) and the \\"heraldic emblem of the Merovingian bloodline\\" ‚Äì the symbol was a \\"Capetian innovation, first employed by Robert II of France before the science of heraldry even existed.\\"Carl E. Olson, Sandra Miesel, The Da Vinci Hoax: Exposing The Errors in the Da Vinci Code, page 231 (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 2004). An anonymous twelfth century poem about the Battle of Tolbiac (c.496) first claimed that Clovis replaced his toad-covered buckler with the fleur-de-lys.Anne Walters Robinson, Guillaume de Machaut and Reims: Context and Meaning in His Musical Works, page 242, and quote \\"The connection of the fleur-de-lys with the kings of France dates back to the twelfth century. Prior to this time, royal banners displayed crescents or toads, both of which were pagan symbols held over from pre- Christian Gaul\\" (Cambridge University Press, 2002). Starbird's theories have been criticized for being based on medieval lore and art, rather than on historical treatment of the Bible.Ben Witherington, The Gospel Code: novel claims about Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Da Vinci, page 16 (InterVarsity Press, 2004). Both Darrell BockBock, Darrell L. Breaking The Da Vinci Code : Answers to the Questions Everyone's Asking / Darrell L. Bock. Waterville, Me. : Thorndike Press, 2004. 239 p. (large print) ; 22 cm. (alk. paper) and Bart D. EhrmanDarrell L. Bock, Was Jesus Married? have claimed that \\"There is no reference to Jesus' marriage or a wife in the Four Gospels\\" and, \\"There is no reference to Jesus' marriage or a wife in any other early Christian writing\\".http://www.religionfacts.com/da_vinci_code/jesus_married.htm Starbird's interpretation of the Gnostic Gospels as suggesting an amorous relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalen is not widely accepted amongst Biblical scholars or skeptics. The (non-canonical) Gospel of Philip states that Mary Magdalen was Jesus' \\"companion\\", that Jesus \\"loved her more than all his disciples\\", and that he \\"often kissed her on her [...]\\". The paragraph concerned describes Mary Magdalene as \\"barren\\" and being \\"the mother of the angels\\"; one scholar observed that the Gospel of Philip goes so far as to say \\"that marital relations defile a woman.\\".Richard Abanes, The Truth Behind The Da Vinci Code, page 41 (Harvest House Publishers, 2004). . Citing Wesley Isenberg, who translated the Gospel of Philip. Likewise, Starbird has claimed that the medieval Cathars believed Jesus was married to Mary Magdelen, through an interpretation of the Major Arcana of the Tarot, but this is also disputed.Carl E. Olson, Sandra Miesel, The Da Vinci Hoax: Exposing The Errors in the Da Vinci Code, page 220 (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 2004). Even if one were to acknowledge Starbird's interpretation of these, critics of The Da Vinci Code such as Robert M. Price have countered that no institutional continuity exists between 2nd century Gnostics and medieval Cathars, nor between the Cathars and the Knights Templar as works such as The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail have suggested.

An avid educational advocate, O‚ÄôMalley worked at Nova Scotia Community College as a principal before entering politics. He served in the Nova Scotia Assembly for a decade and became the Minister of Supply and Services and then Minister of Science and Technology under Premier John Savage. Early life O'Malley was born in Halifax in 1927 to Michael O'Malley and Mary Brackett. He was educated at Saint Mary's University, originally wanting to be an electrician. He also served in the Royal Canadian Air Force, retiring in 1967.The Canadian Parliamentary Guide, 1989, pg. 851 An avid educational advocate, O‚ÄôMalley was an educator working as a vocational teacher and later as principal at the Akerley campus of the Nova Scotia Community College in Halifax. Career In 1980, O'Malley was elected to Halifax City Council, where he served as Deputy Mayor in 1984. O'Malley entered provincial politics in the 1988 election, defeating New Democrat Maureen MacDonald by 776 votes in the Halifax Needham riding. He was re-elected in the 1993 election, defeating his New Democrat opponent by 972 votes. He served as a backbench member of John Savage's government until March 1995, when he was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Minister of Supply and Services.

A MAPS program features several interrelated and defined capital projects, funded by a temporary sales tax (allowing projects to be paid for in cash, without incurring debt), administered by a separate dedicated city staff funded by the sales tax, and supervised by a volunteer citizens oversight committee. In some ways, a MAPS program is similar to a Local option sales tax. However, taxes collected by a MAPS program do not go to a city's general fund, but are instead deposited into a trust dedicated to the specific projects identified in the taxes' enabling ordinance. Additionally, MAPS programs are only indirectly controlled by a city's elected governance body; a citizens oversight committee provides direct oversight, which is also established by the enabling ordinance. Features of a MAPS program The key features of the original program were designed to provide accountability to the citizens of the community as well as provide a funding mechanism for capital projects without using a city's general revenue funds, and included: * Several capital projects, each designed to appeal to a variety of demographic groups within the city, while at the same time having \\"those projects geographically close to each other to create a synergy of activity for people.\\" * The overall program would be funded by a dedicated, multi-year sales tax with a start date and end date * Projects would be paid for in cash, without incurring debt; with this \\"pay as you go\\" approach, construction does not start until the cost of the project has been collected; money is in an interest bearing bank account and not deposited in the city's general fund. * The Program would be overseen by a volunteer citizens advisory committee, whose recommendations for architects, plans and construction documents, contractors, and change-orders would be forwarded to city council for approval * Projects would be administered by a separate and dedicated city staff, hired specifically for the term of the program, with salaries and expenses a component of program costs, paid from sales tax revenue * Each project would be allocated an endowment sufficient to operate and maintain the building without additional cost to the city's general fund A common challenge of \\"pay as you go\\" programs such as MAPS is that, because the lead-up time while accumulating the needed funds can be lengthy, specific projects of the program \\"are often are scuttled when administrations change and new leaders want their own signature projects... Oklahoma City was able to avoid this pitfall ‚Äπbecause the city‚Ä∫ changes mayors, but not strategies.\\" Because the voters approved a multi-year temporary sales tax that was dedicated to multiple specific projects that together had significant public support, and because the infrastructure to support the program and its projects was also temporary with dedicated funding from the sales tax, a change in elected officials has not been sufficient to change the scope of the program. A key to success is the feature of multiple projects; while each project taken individually might not have sufficient support for individual funding, when taken as a group, the package has sufficient support for funding. Said another way, it is important to \\"bundle projects to enhance community buy-in.\\" Another benefit of multiple projects is that by staging the projects, citizens may have their confidence level increased by being shown staggered \\"early results ‚Äπwith less expensive projects‚Ä∫ ... by experiencing a string of groundbreakings.\\" History In many ways the early 1980s recession in the United States began in Oklahoma City with the collapse of the Penn Square Bank. This subsequent collapse of the state's energy business and failure of additional financial institutions, lead to a significant out-migration and excess capacity in real estate. The resulting lack of infrastructure investment in the inner city proved to be a factor in the city's inability to attract new business. In the early 1990s some Oklahoma City interests were concerned about what they perceived as civic decline. In 1992, after the city lost a contract to house a new maintenance facility for United Airlines to Indianapolis, Indiana because the airline considered Indianapolis to have a better standard of living and quality of life, then-mayor Ron Norick and the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce proposed MAPS as a measure to improve the city's economy and attractiveness as a tourist destination. City residents were initially skeptical over funding the public projects through a sales tax increase, and as late as a month before the tax referendum opposed the plan by a 20% margin. However, the plan did pass by a slim margin in a vote in December, 1993. During the five year tax period the city raised nearly $310 million in direct taxes, plus $52 million of income on the tax money it had deposited. The tax was extended with voter approval for an additional six months to raise enough money to complete all of the projects, and construction continued until 2004. Encouraged by the success of MAPS, city leaders proposed and adopted \\"MAPS for Kids\\", a public school improvement program. In December 2009 the city approved a third program, \\"MAPS 3\\", which would build $777 million in further improvements paid for by a similar sales tax increase. Oklahoma City MAPS initiative The MAPS initiatives in Oklahoma City, to date, consist of three major programs: The original MAPS program, MAPS for Kids, and MAPS 3. MAPS The original Metropolitan Area Projects Plan, or MAPS, was a $350 million public works and redevelopment project in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma during the middle to late 1990s, funded by a temporary, five year, voter-approved sales tax increase. \\"The various MAPS projects were believed to be capable of improving the economy and attractiveness of this ‚Äπdowntown‚Ä∫ core and having a profound impact on proximal areas;\\" the common theme of the projects was downtown redevelopment. The original MAPS program comprised nine projects that took 10 years to complete, and were chosen to appeal to a wide variety of city residents and also revitalize the city's downtown: *renovations to the Civic Center Music Hall including the 2,500 seat Thelma Gaylord Performing Arts Theater, the 290 seat Freedie Little Theater, the 100 seat City Space Theater, the 5,000 sf Minders Hall of Mirrors, and the 3,100 sf Joel Levine Rehearsal Hall. *renovations to The Myriad (now the Cox Convention Center) including a 100,000 sf expansion of the convention space. The Cox center also includes a 15,000 seat multi-purpose arena that was home to the Oklahoma City Barons hockey team (the top farm team of the Edmonton Oilers). *renovations to the Oklahoma State Fairgrounds *construction of the Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark home of the Oklahoma City Dodgers, the Triple-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers Major League Baseball team. The park has seating for up to 13,066 fans and currently utilizes a seating capacity of 9,000 for Dodgers games. *construction of the 18,203 seat Ford Center (now called the Chesapeake Energy Arena), an indoor multipurpose sports arena. The arena was completed for several years before it became an important aspect of plans in 2006 through 2008 by local businessman Clay Bennett, who lead the purchase of the Seattle SuperSonics, and later moved the basketball team to Oklahoma City. The NBA team is now called the Oklahoma City Thunder. *construction of the \\"Bricktown Canal\\" which provided a core investment to transform a former warehouse district into an entertainment district; with \\"recreation activities available in Bricktown are currently ‚Äπ2009‚Ä∫ estimated to draw 2.9 million visits annually\\" *construction of a riverfront and recreational dams on the North Canadian River (this section of the river has been renamed the Oklahoma River, its lower section is known as the Boathouse District, the headquarters for USA Canoe/Kayak and a training center for USRowing) *a new Library/learning Center, later called the Ronald J. Norick Downtown Library, a four-story main library to replace a facility that had been built in 1951 *development of the Oklahoma Spirit Trolleys, a trolley-replica bus network MAPS for Kids The second MAPS program, called MAPS for Kids, was a $700 million initiative to improve schools in the various school districts whose boundaries coincided with the City of Oklahoma City. Oklahoma has school districts whose boundaries have nothing to do with the boundaries of any other political subdivision. At the time the original MAPS tax was expiring, the Oklahoma City Public Schools system was struggling with little political capital. \\"They could not pass bond issues, and the school buildings were falling apart as a result.\\" Then mayor Kirk Humphreys proposed a second MAPS program to repair more than 100 area schools. With the addition of a $180-million bond issue and an eye on addressing childhood obesity issues, new gymnasiums were added to all of the Oklahoma City District's elementary schools. The program was approved by voters in 2001. This temporary sales tax was collected for seven years, with 70 percent disbursed to the Oklahoma City School District and 30 percent to 23 Suburban School Districts. MAPS 3 MAPS 3 is a $777 million program, approved by voters in 2009 with 54% of the vote (the same percentage as the Original MAPS.) The one-cent sales tax initiative began in April 2010 and ends in December 2017. After a year of public meetings organized by Mayor Mick Cornett, there developed a consensus that a future MAPS program should focus on projects that improved the Quality of Life in Oklahoma City. Hundreds of citizens suggested projects to be considered; through a series of public meetings eight projects were eventually selected to be included in the MAPS 3 proposal. *New Downtown Convention Center *New Downtown Public Park - 70 acres, including festival areas *New Modern Streetcar/Transit system and an inter-modal transit hub *New Senior Health and Wellness Centers; multiple structures in various parts of the city designed to encourage healthy lifestyles and serve as a gathering place for active seniors *Improvements to the Oklahoma River including a whitewater training facility and various upgrades to the world-class rowing racecourse *Improvements to the Oklahoma State Fair Grounds including replacing public event buildings *Expansion of Trails system that interconnects the city's major parks for walking and biking *Expansion of neighborhood sidewalks to create a more walkable community Recognizing that the city's economy may fluctuate during the time of the sales tax collection, and that there may be unforeseen project contingencies, the program also has a significant Infrastructure/Contingency component. The public forum process used to identify projects to be included in the MAPS 3 program established enough public political support to overcome an effort by a newly elected city council person who attempted to derail the original MAPS 3 proposal. An initiative petition was filed that would have eliminated the Convention Center and ended the Sales tax earlier. This council person also ran for Mayor, with MAPS being a major factor in the election. Mayor Cornett was re-elected for an unprecedented 4th term with 65.7% of the vote.  MAPS 4  Comparison of Yes votes and total votes of the MAPS initiatives On December 10, 2019, voters passed MAPS 4. The one cent sales tax will be extended for eight years, and is expected to bring in $978 million. Sixteen Projects are centered around neighborhood and quality of life needs for the city. https://results.okelections.us/OKER/?elecDate=20191210 Impact of MAPS in Oklahoma City The MAPS programs have had significant impact in Oklahoma City, both economically and from a quality of life standpoint. In the 20 years since its inception \\"nearly $5 billion in economic impact can be attributed to the original MAPS program. This represents a nearly 10-fold return on the city's original investment.\\" As was recently reported in a Wichita newspaper, \\"From quirky festivals and dozens of restaurants to outdoor recreation and romantic riverboat rides, a revitalized downtown Oklahoma City boasts so many attractions it is quickly becoming a favorite weekend destination for Oklahomans and Kansans alike.\\" It is arguable that in terms of associated investment, hotels segment represent the largest impact of the original MAPS. \\"In 1992-93 when the city's leaders developed the plans for the MAPS investments, there was only one significant hotel operating in downtown Oklahoma City. What is now the Sheraton had nearly 400 rooms but was in need of upgrading. By 2008, there were seven significant hotels in the Downtown CBD and Bricktown with a total of about 1,600 rooms.\\" References External links *MAPS page - official page, maintained by the Government of Oklahoma City Sales taxes Urban planning Local taxation in the United States History of Oklahoma City Government of Oklahoma City Oklahoma City metropolitan area ","title":"Metropolitan Area Projects Plan"},{"id":"25106327","text":"Finger Poppin' with the Horace Silver Quintet is an album by jazz pianist Horace Silver released on the Blue Note label in 1959 featuring performances by Silver with Blue Mitchell, Junior Cook, Gene Taylor, and Louis Hayes.Horace Silver discography accessed 17 November 2009.

Design Between 1941 and 1946, the United States Navy acquired 35 Barnegat-class small seaplane tenders, designated \\"AVP\\" in the Navys alphanumeric hull numbering system and designed to logistically and administratively support a squadron of flying boats operating from undeveloped areas and, with a substantial anti-air, antisurface, and antisubmarine capability, to escort larger seaplane tenders. Most of them served during World War II, although even during the war the Navy determined the number of Barnegats to be surplus to requirements; as a result, one was completed as a catapult training ship for Navy floatplane pilots (retaining its \\"AVP\\" designation) and four were converted during construction into motor torpedo boat tenders, redesignated \\"AGP\\".Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1922-1946, p. 157 After World War II, the Navy had a surplus of seaplane tenders, and the Coast Guard was looking for ships to serve on ocean stations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans on weather-reporting duties, also performing law enforcement and search and rescue operations as required.

The vessel has ample space for stores, living accommodations, ships, offices and recreational facilities. The main engine system is excellent. . . .The performance of the vessel in moderate to heavy seas is definitely superior to that of any other cutter. This vessel can be operated at higher speed without storm damage than other Coast Guard vessels.\\"U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Web site (at http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Casco1949.asp) Acquisition and modifications The Navy transferred three of the seaplane tenders outright to the Coast Guard in 1946; they entered service that year and in 1947. The Navy loaned twelve more seaplane tenders, the catapult training ship, and two of the motor torpedo boat tenders to the Coast Guard in 1948, and these entered Coast Guard service in 1948 and 1949; in 1966, the Navy transferred these ships outright to the Coast Guard as well. Of the ships the Coast Guard received, two had been built by the Boston Navy Yard at Boston, Massachusetts, and the rest in the state of Washington: three by Associated Shipbuilders, Inc., at Seattle, ten by Lake Washington Shipyard at Houghton, and three by the Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bremerton. Once they were accepted into Coast Guard service, a number of changes were made to prepare the ships for ocean- station duty. A balloon shelter was added aft, a hydrographic winch and an oceanographic winch were installed, and spaces on board were devoted to oceanographic equipment.U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Web site (at http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Casco1949.asp) Classification Under the alphanumeric hull classification system in use at the time, Coast Guard cutters transferred from the Navy retained their Navy classification, with a \\"W\\" added to the beginning of the classification to indicate their Coast Guard subordination. The former seaplane tenders and the former catapult training ship thus all received the classification \\"WAVP\\"; the two former motor torpedo boat tenders (AGPs), which reverted to their original \\"AVP\\" designation before transfer to the Coast Guard, also entered Coast Guard service as WAVPs. The only exception was , which initially was designated WAGC-18, but soon received a WAVP designation like the others. In 1965, , uniquely among the Cascos, was reclassified as an \\"oceanographic\\" ship, WAGO-377. In 1966 the Coast Guard reclassified all of the Cascos‚Äîincluding Rockaway‚Äîas high endurance cutters and changed their classification to \\"WHEC\\". The ships retained the same hull numbers they had had as WAVPs. Some Cascos later underwent additional classification changes as their roles changed in their final years in service. was a training ship (WTR-379) from 1969 to 1975 before reverting to her WHEC classification, became a \\"meteorological cutter\\" (WAGW-387) in 1970, and Rockaway became an \\"offshore law enforcement vessel\\" (WOLE-377) in 1971.  Naming  The class was named for , later WHEC-370, the unit with the lowest Coast Guard alphanumeric hull number. The three ships transferred outright to the Coast Guard in 1946 were given new names upon commissioning in the Coast Guard, being named after U.S. Secretaries of the Treasury. The 15 ships loaned to the Coast Guard in 1948 retained their original Navy names, and were named for islands, bays, and inlets, around the United States and the then-Territory of Alaska.  Operations  The first three ships entered service in 1946 and 1947, with the rest following in 1948 and 1949. Apart from , which was out of commission for several years in the 1950s, all remained active without break until the late 1960s and early 1970s, and one, , after a brief period out of commission in the mid-1970s, remained in service until 1988. All saw service as weather-reporting ships on ocean station patrols until the late 1960s and early 1970s except Dexter, which became the Coast Guards United States West Coast training ship after returning to commission in 1958. The Cascos had a variety of fates. The Navy sank five as targets in 1968 and 1969, and five others were scrapped in the early 1970s. The last survivor in Coast Guard service, Unimak, was scuttled to form an artificial reef. Seven ships were transferred to South Vietnam in 1971 and 1972. When South Vietnam collapsed at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, six fled to the Philippines, where two were cannibalized for spare parts and the other four entered service in the Philippine Navy, operating until the mid-1980s. The seventh ship, the former , was captured by North Vietnam, appears to have remained active in the Vietnam People's Navy into the 1990s, and may remain afloat today as the last surviving Barnegat- or Casco-class ship.

He is buried at the Didube Pantheon in Tbilisi. His son was Shalva Aleksi-Meskhishvili, a Georgian jurist and politician. Life and career Born in Tbilisi, Lado Aleksi-Meskhishvili studied medicine at the University of Moscow. Illness forced him to abandon studies and return to Georgia, where he worked as a teacher in Telavi. After medical studies and amateur acting, he joined the Tbilisi Georgian-language troupe in 1881, running it from 1890 to 1896 and from 1910 to 1914, and the Kutaisi Theater from 1897 to 1906 and again from 1914 to 1915.

Works A flamboyantly heroic actor, Aleksi-Meskhishvili used his performances to promote revolutionary ideas, and even engaged in barricade fighting during the Russian Revolution of 1905. He staged more than one hundred plays and translated many dramatic writings. His success, particularly in the musical comedies of his youth, is thought to be thanks to his ear for music and an exceptional voice. An example of how much he was loved and respected is the case of his 1903 illness when public awareness of the fact resulted in Georgian society gathering together the funds to send him to Vienna for medical treatment. In 1930, Aleksi-Meskhishvili was posthumously granted the title of People's Artist by Soviet Georgia. Aleksi-Meskhishvili's name was given to the Kutaisi Drama Theatre in 1940.

In 1914, with the onset of World War I, those powers found themselves on separate sides, and all tried to recruit Poles into their ranks, promising increased autonomy after the war in return.Norman Davies, God's Playground: 1795 to the present, Columbia University Press, 2005, , Google Print, pp. 281‚Äì282R.

In January 1915 Polish National Committee threw its support behind the initiative, and colonel Antoni Reutt was nominated for the organization's commander. As the numbers of volunteers were growing, a second legion was created in Lublin (the Lublin Legion). A cavalry formation was also being created. The formation was officially known as the Polish Legion(s), and was subordinate to the 59th Defence Brigade of General Piotr Szymanowski.  Organisation  By January 1915 the Legion has finished organizing, at that time numbering about 1,000 volunteers; an equivalent of an Imperial Russian Army infantry battalion (in February it would be divided into four companies). It was however still plagued by logistical problems (for example, it did not receive the promised artillery, and the machine guns it received were captured Austrian ones ‚Äì without ammunition). There were also problems with the transfer of volunteers from other Russian Imperial formation (requests were commonly denied), and the project to recruit volunteers from Polish prisoners of war from the Austro-Hungarian Army was refused. On 5 February 1915, the Legions were reorganized as 'Narodnoe Opolcheniye' units: * the Pu≈Çawy Legion into the 739th Novo Aleksandrovo Militia Battalion, * the Lublin Legion into the 740th Lublin Militia Battalion. The Pu≈Çawy Legion was deployed to the frontlines on 20 March 1915; at that time it was taken out from under general Szymanowski and was assigned to the Moscow Grenadier Corps under general Mrozowski. The Lublin Legion was never deployed to the frontlines, instead it was used to replenish the losses of the Pu≈Çawy Legion. The formation was to be used in combat against the German Empire, but morale was affected by the rumors it would be used against Austria-Hungary and its Polish Legions.Operations of the Polish Legions (including the Pu≈Çawy Legion)  Battles  The formation fought in several battles: * 19 May ‚Äì at Pakos≈Çaw (where colonel Reutt was injured, and the command passed to colonel Jan RzƒÖdkowski) * 16 June ‚Äì at Micha≈Ç√≥w (or Micha≈Çowo) * 17 July ‚Äì at W≈Çadys≈Çawowo * 21 July ‚Äì at Kolonia Chechelska * 22 July ‚Äì at Pu≈Çawska G√≥ra * 14 August ‚Äì at Karczowka * 20 August ‚Äì at Nurzec * 23 August ‚Äì at Opaka * 5 September ‚Äì at Izabelin * 9 September ‚Äì at Zelwa During that period, the Legion sustained heavy casualties ‚Äì 415 dead and 1,016 wounded (92% of its initial numbers). Eventually, the Legion was disbanded in October 1915; some troops joined the newly forming Polish Rifle Brigade (). The reorganization was a result of efforts by Colonel RzƒÖdkowaski and others aiming at increasing the size of the Polish forces in the Russian Army.

It is found in the basins of the Paran√° and Paraguay River basins in South America. Most chemical weathering of minerals seems to take place in the upland drainage basins rather than on the floodplains, and most major solutes display conservative mixing in the river-floodplain system.Hamilton, Stephen K., Sippel, Suzanne J., Calheiros, D√ìbora F., Melack, John M., ( 1997), An anoxic event and other biogeochemical effects of the Pantanal wetland on the Paraguay River, Limnology and Oceanography, 42, doi: 10.4319/lo.1997.42.2.0257.

Appearance Dorsal and ventral view Almost circular in shape, it grows up to in disc width and in weight. The upper surface is covered with denticles (sharp tooth-like scales). The coloration is light brownish with mottled patterns on the dorso, and pink on the ventral side. As with all stingrays, the mouth and gill openings are on the underside, and the eyes and gills exits are on the dorsal side. Sting Like other stingrays, the fish of this genus have venomous barbs at the base of their tails, and are dangerous to humans. The sting is replaced at roughly six-month intervals. It is an almost flat, barbed structure that can reach in length, and is covered with a toxic mucus, making any attack a very painful one. The natives of South America are said to fear the stingray more than the piranha. However, they are not aggressive fish and not dangerous unless stepped on or otherwise threatened. Aquarium P. histrix, male (left) and female (right). Notice the two claspers on the male Freshwater stingrays of the genus Potamotrygon are sometimes kept as exotic aquarium fish; though freshwater stingray of other genera do appear in the trade, most are from this genus. They are best kept with a deep, sandy substrate, in which they bury themselves, often with only their eyes visible. They are not territorial with other animals and can be kept in groups, provided a large enough aquarium is provided. They are carnivorous bottom-feeders and require strong filtration as they are rather sensitive to water conditions (any spike in NO2 levels can kill them with no warning).. Juvenile stingrays are unable to survive in waters that contain salinity over 20.6%.Griffith, Robert W., et al. ‚ÄúSerum Composition of Freshwater Stringrays (Potamotrygonidae) Adapted to Fresh and Dilute Sea Water.‚Äù Biological Bulletin, vol. 144, no. 2, 1973, pp. 304‚Äì320.

The male should be smaller than the female, as it is rather aggressive, biting the female during the mating process. Males can be determined by the presence of claspers as in other chondrichthyans.

The vine was named after Albert J. Winkler, Chair of the Department of Viticulture and Enology (1935‚Äì1957) at University of California, Davis. Planted in 1979, the Winkler vine was a Vitis vinifera cv. Mission, grafted on to a Vitis rupestris St George rootstock. A great deal of research has been carried out on pruning, training and vine size; by researchers such as: Ravaz, Winkler, Shaulis, Koblet, Howell, Carbonneau, Smart & Clingeleffer. Minimal pruning is a pruning/training system adapted from the principles of big-vine theory. History The Mission grape cultivar was originally brought to South America from Spain by Catholic missionaries and was introduced into California in the 18th century. Historically Mission was the most widely planted cultivar in California, up to the 1850s. The Winkler Vine was trained on a 60x60ft steel arbour, covering 1/12 of an acre and was capable of producing over a tonne of fruit. The Winkler vine was damaged by a tractor 'early in its life' and carried a large canker; eventually the vine became infected with the wood rot, Eutypa, causing its death in spring 2008. Big vine viticulture The vine was the classic example of big vine culture, where vines are trained and pruned to allow the plant to express its natural vigour; rather than forcing a vine into a restricted trellis system by heavy pruning. Eventually a 'big- vine' will reach its maximum size and yield compensation will result in 'balanced' cropping. Big vine production of grapes is not economically feasible (due to the time taken to establish the plant); however it demonstrates the natural ability of a vine produce in sustainable manner (yield vs. fruit ripeness vs. carbohydrate storage).

Origins  The group was founded in 2006 by a group of parliamentarians with Senator Rom√©o Dallaire as its founder.http://www.romeodallaire.com/shake-hands-with-the-devil/genocide- prevention.html It was inspired by the success of a similar parliamentary group in the United Kingdom and grew out of the Save Darfur Coalition initiated in 2006.  Mandate  The mandate of the Genocide Prevention Group is to: #Ensure that the government of Canada galvanizes to prevent and protect civilian populations from genocide, crimes against humanity, and the incitement to such crimes in accordance with the principles of \\"The Responsibility to Protect (R2P)\\" #Increase the flow of information and analysis to parliamentarians about genocide and other crimes against humanity; #Promote understanding of the importance of long-term approaches to genocide prevention; and #Engage in communication and collaboration with like-minded bodies in civil society and other Parliaments in order to: ::*Exchange information about strategies for the prevention of genocide and other crimes against humanity; ::*Work in conjunction with the United Nations Special Advisor for the Prevention of Genocide, the International Criminal Court, and other organizations working in the field of Genocide prevention and post conflict justice; and ::*create international channels for the timely exchange of information regarding emerging crises that have a potentially genocidal component.  Members  Membership in the Genocide Prevention Group is open to all Parliamentarians. There are currently about twenty official members of the Genocide Prevention Group, with some sixty parliamentarians who participate in events hosted by the Genocide Prevention Group.  Executive  The Executive is composed of a Chair, three Vice-Chairs, one from each of the parties represented at Parliament, and an ex officio member. The Group is currently chaired by Member of Parliament Ali Ehsassi and the vice-chairs are as follows: Garnett Genuis, MP (Conservative); Ruby Sahota, MP (Liberal); and Cheryl Hardcastle, MP (NDP).

Education work Anderson was born in Washington County, Pennsylvania, on November 22, 1817. He graduated from Washington and Jefferson College in 1836. After graduation, Anderson moved to Kentucky to teach. In 1842 he and his wife opened two separate private schools for boys and girls in New Albany, Indiana, known as the Anderson Collegiate Institute and Anderson's Female Seminary. He operated the schools until 1858. Charles Woodruff Shields and Narcissa Chisholm Owen were graduates of the Institute, and the missionary William Alexander Parsons Martin served as professor of classics for one year at the school. Railroad work Pennsylvania Railroad map, 1857 In the 1850s, Anderson turned his focus to railroad operations. In 1851, he supervised the construction of a road from New Albany to Corydon, Indiana. In 1852, he was chosen chief engineer of a proposed road from the Ohio River, below the falls to Sandusky, Ohio; and then for three years, ending in 1858, he was General Superintendent of the New Albany and Salem Railroad. During this time, Anderson continued to operate his educational institutions. As his railroad work took more and more of his time, Anderson gradually withdrew from teaching. After 1858, he devoted himself wholly to railroading. Pennsylvania Railroad In November 1858, Anderson accepted the office of Superintendent for the Middle Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad. In February 1859, he was advanced to the General Superintendency of the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway. In less than a year, however, Anderson was called to be Superintendent of Transportation on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, a position in which the opening of the American Civil War found him. Civil War During the Civil War, he served in the Union Army as superintendent of various railroads, first as a civilian and later with the rank of colonel. In November 1861, General William Tecumseh Sherman appointed John Anderson as Railroad Director for the Department of the Ohio. In February 1862, Anderson was succeeded in this position by Daniel McCallum, after the creation of the United States Military Railroad. Subsequently, in November 1862, General William Rosecrans appointed Anderson military superintendent of railroads for the Department of the Cumberland. McCallum relieved him of this duty in 1864. Postbellum In 1864, Anderson left the Army and became interested in the Union Pacific Railway, Eastern Division, then being planned on a route through Kansas. He apparently never assumed control of the railroad's construction, as urged by the company's president John Perry, but he did become financially involved. In 1868, he and his wife moved to Junction City, Kansas, where his nephew John Alexander Anderson was serving as a preacher. In 1873, his nephew became president of Kansas State Agricultural College in Manhattan, Kansas, and in 1880, John Byers Anderson also moved to Manhattan, where he would remain for the rest of his life. While in Manhattan, Anderson served as president of the First National Bank of Manhattan. In the 1880s, Anderson also served as president of the board of trustees of the College of Emporia in Emporia, Kansas. In 1888, on the occasion of his 50th wedding anniversary, he established the Anderson Memorial Library at the college through a donation of his book collection. John Byers Anderson died at Manhattan on July 25, 1897. After his death, in 1908 his large Manhattan home was purchased to serve as the first Catholic school in the town, later called the Sacred Heart Academy. In 1901, Andrew Carnegie donated $30,000 to the College of Emporia in memory of Col. Anderson, who had years earlier allowed Carnegie and other boys to use his library in Pennsylvania's, and inspired Carnegie's self-improvement and lifelong learning.Karen Kilcup (ed) A Cherokee Woman's America: the memoirs of Narcissa Owen 1831-1907 (University of Florida Press 2005) pp. 139-141 citing St. Louis Republic (Feb. 17, 1901) Relatives John Byers Anderson was the second son of the Rev.

Kline was the former President of the National Academy of Public Administration; former Deputy and Acting Administrator, General Services Administration (GSA); and former Associate Administrator, Management Operations, NASA. Early years Kline was born in the town of New Ringgold, Pennsylvania to Rev. Raymond Adam Kline and Marie (Herb). He, and his three sisters, were raised by their mother after their father died in 1936 from respiratory complications brought on by mustard gas exposure in World War I. Economic circumstances after Rev. Kline's death compelled the family to move to the Lutheran Orphans Home in Topton, PA. Kline, along with his mother Marie and three sisters, Helen, Marguerite and Yvonne, lived for two years at the orphanage from 1938 to 1940. Kline attended Lebanon High School in Lebanon, Pennsylvania from 1941 to 1944 where he was actively involved in academic clubs and sports.

A notable speech included the often repeated phrase \\"the moon is our Paris,\\" written for the Fourth National Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space in 1964. Kline maintained several close ties with the astronauts and staff involved in the early Moon missions. Kline moved back to the Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC in a new capacity at NASA as the Associate Administrator for Management Operations from 1968 to 1979. Kline remained involved with space exploration and manned space missions, which became a lifelong passion. After his tenure at NASA, Kline took the job of Deputy Administrator at GSA from 1979 to 1985 and was GSA's Acting Administrator 1981, 1984-1985. In 1982, Kline was awarded the Presidential rank of Distinguished Senior Executive by President Reagan. As Acting Administrator of GSA, Kline worked to restore independence of the National Archives from GSA and directly contributed to passage of the National Archives and Records Administration Act of 1984. After his retirement in 1985 from public service after 33 years in the Federal government, Kline became President of the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), a non- partisan, nonprofit corporation established in 1967 and chartered by Congress to provide research and counsel to increase the effectiveness of American government at all levels.

He worked out for the development of a Medium Term Development Plan of the college (2011‚Äì2015), and instituted a new set-up for the college. The new college set-up produced two campus clusters: the North Cluster ‚Äì consisting of Santa Maria, Santiago and Narvacan, and the South Cluster ‚Äì consisting of Tagudin, Candon City and Cervantes. He emphasized on the cultivation of a research and development culture with the creation of the Office of Vice President for Planning, Research, Extension and Training. He also aggressively pushed for physical plant development. Campuses The main campus for the North Cluster is the Santa Maria Campus which has been identified as the Provincial Institute of Agriculture. Santa Maria campus had its early beginnings as a farm school in 1913, then evolved into the Santa Maria Agricultural High School. In 1963, SMAHS was converted into the Ilocos Sur Agricultural College by virtue of RA 3529 authored by Congressman Pablo C. Sanidad. Then in 1995, it was converted into the Ilocos Sur Polytechnic College which was the precursor of the present ISPSC. The Narvacan Campus was established as the Narvacan School of Fisheries in 1964 by virtue of RA 3476 authored by Cong. Pablo C. Sanidad which was signed into law on June 16, 1962. When it was integrated into ISPSC, the Narvacan Campus became the College of Fisheries and Marine Science. Today, it is identified as the Provincial Institute of Agriculture. The Santiago Campus was established as the Ilocos Sur Experimental Station and Pilot School of Cottage Industries (ISESPSCI) by virtue of RA 4430 signed into law on June 19, 1965. It is situated on a 3.5 hectare area along the national highway in the municipality of Santiago, Ilocos Sur. When it was integrated into ISPSC, it became the College of Engineering and Technology.

Early dynasties and the Silk Road The Silk Road extending from southern Europe through Arabia, Somalia, Egypt, Persia, India and Java until it reaches China. The first historical instance of China engaging in internationalism was during the Han Dynasty.Killion, U. (2006) A modern Chinese journey to the west. New York: Nova Science Publishers, Inc. At the start of the Han Dynasty, the Huns in the north were attacking the frontiers of Han and trying to obtain riches. Emperor Wu of Han wanted to gain an alliance with a country called Dayuezhi so the two countries could join together and fight against the Huns.Wild, O. (1992). The Silk road. Retrieved from To obtain this alliance, Emperor Wu sent Zhang Qian to the West to establish economic and cultural connections. History records that during the Han Dynasty there were four primary avenues of contact between China and Europe. They included the northern land route, the central land route, the southern sea route, and the far southern sea route. The most famous of these routes is the central land route, or the classical Silk Road, comprising a network of roads stretching from northwest China to the ports of Syria and the Black Sea, which passed through the oasis of the Turkestans and Northern Persia. The Silk Road was significant for Chinese emperors because it provided dominance over Central Asia by developing resources and provided new markets for the export of China's most valuable resources. During the Tang Dynasty there was a new age of urbanization and increased maritime commerce. For instance, Changan, the capital of the Dynasty, developed into one of the largest cities during that time. By 742 CE, the population had reached almost 2 million and census showed that 5,000 foreigners lived in the city: Turks, Iranians, Indians, and others from along the road. Trade continued to flourish during this period and brought an increased number of foreigners, foreign religions, and foreign ideas in China. The Song Dynasty transformed the focus of the Silk Road from the reliance on domestic trade to a reliance on Pacific Orientation. Trade was now supported by a large merchant marine and defended by an imperial navy and long distance routes to the Middle East, India and the coast of Africa were now more readily available.G. Veeck, C. Pannell, C. Smith and Y. Huang. China‚Äôs Geography: Rowman and Littlefield, Lanham MD, 2007 During this period, the government started to heavily regulate foreign trade due to military threats on the Northern border. In order to monitor the flow of commodities in international trade, the Bureau of Merchant Shipping was established to tax merchant ships passing through. In addition, international trade became less focused on cultural exchanges and instead was seen as a necessity for the growth of the Chinese economy.  Modern China   20th Century China  China's efforts to balance the economic and socio-political tasks of education in its modern nation-building can be traced back to the struggles of the late Qing dynasty, under threat of foreign aggression for modernization and national survival. This dilemma has persisted through the establishment of the Republic of China (1912‚Äì49) and the People's Republic of China, and onto that of the successors and into modern day. Older societies have had to overhaul their institutions and world views radically in order to conform with the models of the modern nation state system, with post-1949 China being the time that this reordering took place within China. After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the Chinese government instituted a number of reforms that were meant to increase economic growth while at the same time stifling the proliferation of democratic sentiments in their country. To the CCP (or the CPC), Democracy leads to political instability which in turn impedes economic development and this is a sentiment believed by many people inside China. In 1989 China's population was the largest in the world but its GDP was only ninth in the world, yet twenty-five years later China's economy has become the second largest after only the U.S. This major increase in economic development was not without a cost because although economic reform and globalization had brought China unprecedented wealth it also brought China a monstrous increase in carbon dioxide emissions.  21st Century China  Since 2005, China has spent more than $56 billion in sub-Saharan Africa, with significant investment in oil, platinum, copper, nickel, and manganese as well as other extracting industries. China's bilateral trade with African countries rose from $10 billion in 2000 to $125 billion in 2010 and stands to reach $300 billion by 2015, surpassing the United States as Africa's largest trading partner. China's trade with Latin America has also increased dramatically, rising to 1,500% between 2000 and 2010 through loans and direct foreign investment. China is one of the primary winners of the Western sanctions against Iran, as it has allowed them to become its top trading partner, purchasing 400,000 barrels of oil per day all paid for with the yuan in an attempt to elevate the global standing of the yuan against the U.S. dollar. Chinese integration into the global financial system has taken its first steps by way of the launch of the \\"Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect\\" and \\"Shenzhen- Hong Kong Stock Connect\\". The implications that an increase in Chinese integration into the global financial system are many, with positives and negatives for both the Chinese and the Western world. In Hong Kong there have been a number of political battles due to a feeling that with the increase of globalization came an increase of \\"Chinaization\\". Expanding global commerce and the corporate control of the political process weakens the autonomy and power of local communities, which is what Jihad vs. McWorld argues. The more integrated communities become with mainland China, the more prosperity they receive, but most of the advantages go to the various business tycoons and corporate elites, which can be seen as an example of the rise in income inequality in China.  Economic shifts  Since 1980, China has undergone a series of reform policies aimed at transforming its economic system from a planned economy to a market-oriented economy by combining the planning economic systems from socialism with a market mechanism from capitalism. Along with this shift came the creation of four Special Economic Zones, areas of the country that are affected by favorable business laws aimed at increasing trade, investment, and job creation. This was spearheaded by Deng Xiaoping who set out to create a more economically open China, with the results of this new liberalization and globalization of the economy being substantial. During the period of 1978 to 2012, China's GDP grew about 9.8% annually and its GDP volume increased 22.5 times during this period, while its GDP per capita grew at an annual rate of 8.5% and increased 15 times in the same period. By 2010, China surpassed Japan to become the world's second-largest economy and at the same time it also surpassed Germany in terms of export volume, becoming the largest in the world. The massive increase of GDP in China has led to an increase of living standards for the Chinese since their incomes have doubled or even quadrupled every 10 years. Amid this economic outburst, the income distribution in China has increased dramatically, changing China from a relatively equal socialist country to a very unequal country. The economic globalization of China has transformed the nature of its national policy preferences, calling into question for the rest of the world what their true intentions might very well be. The efforts to increase the liberalization of the Chinese economy, spearheaded by the U.S., were met with mixed feelings due to China's rapid economic progress. The bittersweet nature of China's rise in economic power leads to questions about whether or not it will support the existing international order of things or challenge it. The undervalued Chinese yuan with respect to the United States dollar has brought about questions to whether or not a move to a more flexible exchange rate would be beneficial to the Chinese economy, with most experts arguing that no dramatic change in exchange rate is needed and that the most needed policy attention is the domestic financial sector, not the international.  Cultural shifts  The Chinese desire for globalization is countered by the fear of losing their own culture, identity, and history, meaning that the suspicions towards the English language seeping into Chinese (and worldwide) cultures might be justified, if even to a small degree. English has been seen as a new form of opium to some which indicates a growing hostility towards English in China but at the same time raises questions due to English being the predominate language for international trade and communication. China faces an unprecedented multitude of problems with regard to language choice and linguistic identity, some of which are due to challenges imposed by global English from the outside world. Although English was denounced as a language for the Bourgeoisie and imperialist during the Cultural Revolution, it is viewed as a necessary tool in China's modernization and integration with the world. In the 1990s municipal planners in a major Port of China, Dalian, sought to make the city a regional hub for trade, finance, and tourism, attempting to make the city a \\"Hong Kong of the North\\".

He represented the electoral district of Halifax Citadel in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from November 1997 to March 1998. He was a member of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party. Early life and career Born in 1932 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Kinley graduated with a medical degree from Dalhousie University in 1956. He married Sara Jane Hawk. In 1963, Kinley joined the Dalhousie Surgery Department, where he practiced until 1998. Considered to be a pioneer in the cardiovascular surgery field, Kinley performed the first adult open heart surgery and coronary bypass in Nova Scotia. Kinley started the cardiac surgery program at the IWK Children's Hospital and adult cardiac surgery at the Victoria General Hospital. He also established the first cardiac intensive care unit in Atlantic Canada, and implanted the first pacemaker in Atlantic Canada live on CBC Television. Political career Kinley entered provincial politics in 1997, running as the Liberal candidate in a byelection for the Halifax Citadel riding. On November 4, 1997, he defeated NDP candidate Peter Delefes by 165 votes to win the byelection. In the 1998 election, initial results had Kinley losing to Delefes by 125 votes. However, there was some confusion over the calculation of poll results and Delefes' margin of victory was reduced to 40 when official results were announced. A judicial recount was held on April 14, and Delefes was officially declared elected by 37 votes. Kinley ran again in the 1999 election, but finished third as Progressive Conservative Jane Purves won the seat, defeating Delefes by 434 votes. In April 2000, Kinley was elected president of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party.

The organization has professional staffing at every level‚Äîdistrict, council, regional and national. The Chief Scout Executive is the top professional Scouter. The commissioner position is the second oldest in Scouting (Scoutmaster is the oldest) and is the origin of the professional Scouting positions, which is why position insignia of the professional Scouter have the wreath of service as a feature on all professional position patches. In the earliest days of the BSA, some commissioners were paid by local benefactors and supporters to administer and \\"grow Scouting\\" on a daily basis. This was because as the program expanded and more Scout Troops were formed, the capabilities and abilities of the volunteer commissioner to devote time and effort away from their primary work to make Scouting work was stressed. These first \\"Scout executive commissioners\\" (shortened to \\"Scout executives\\") were critical in expanding the BSA's outreach in urban and rural areas around the nation and eventually were under the direction of James E. West, the BSA's first national Chief Scout Executive. Background On January 24, 1908, the Boy Scouts movement begins in England with the publication of the first installment of Robert Baden-Powell‚Äôs Scouting for Boys. Baden-Powell then went on to make his idea of Scouting a worldwide trend. By the end of 1908, there were more than 60,000 young men ‚Äúenrolled‚Äù in the organization. By 1910, the Boy Scouts of America had officially become established as a trendy organization for young boys both in and out of England. Shortly after the BSA was fully operational, there became a need for adults willing to run the organization. From this point on, adults have been in the background, behind the scenes, making sure everything is running as smoothly as possible for the organization. Qualifications The basic qualifications to be a professional are: * Bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university * United States citizenship or declared intention to become a U.S. citizen * Adult‚Äîmust have attained age 21 unless prohibited by any applicable law * People- oriented, having the ability to work well with adult volunteers, community and business leaders, and representatives of other organizations * Able to work varied hours when necessary to achieve positive objectives * Believe in the BSA and subscribe to its principles and standards * Be approved to receive a professional Scouting commission Males and females may apply and have been approved for professional service with the Boy Scouts of America. Those who do not qualify to be a professional may be hired to serve as a paraprofessional or other employed positions within a local council, a Region or at the BSA's National Office. Role The day-to-day work of Scouting is managed by the professional staff. Professionals spend a good part of every day cultivating future partners for various Scouting units; promoting the programs to other organizations, key businesses, key and influential individuals, and the general public. This is the core element of the professional's support to the volunteer. Since the majority of volunteers are working during their day and cannot, for instance, sit down with a corporate executive of a business, the professional does this on behalf of the district's volunteer chairperson and commissioners. Additionally, professionals are tasked with tracking and providing statistical data on the status of each unit, its volunteers and youth members. They are responsible for ensuring that units have the appropriate level of support ‚Äî training, administration and leadership. They work with existing chartered partner organizations to ensure that they are using the BSA's programs in connection with their agreement with the local council to do so. A great deal of each professional's day is spent in raising awareness and financial support for the local council, and in return, for the Boy Scouts of America. While many people have some concept of what Scouting is, the professional member ‚Äî assisted in many cases by key volunteers ‚Äî spends time explaining the importance of Scouting and how the BSA executes its aims of responsible and practical citizenship, personal and moral character, and physical and mental fitness. Many will say that \\"volunteers ‚Äî in particular commissioners ‚Äî do many of these things\\" and in some locations, especially localities whereby professional support is short, they MUST do many of the tasks of professionals. However, the BSA feels that without that man or woman \\"carrying the heavy rocks\\" for their volunteers, the BSA would be a program with limited volunteers, all trying to do \\"everything\\" and end up achieving very little progress toward keeping the programs active, and expanding the movement to youth members who need what Scouting provides. Local councils The professional staff in local BSA councils consists of one or more commissioned BSA professionals. Smaller councils usually have three to five professionals, medium-sized councils have six or more professionals, and the largest councils may have 20 or more professionals. All professional Scouters are considered \\"exempt\\" employees according to the standards of the Fair Labor Standards Act and are salaried rather than paid by hourly wage. Most councils have a similar number of support staff and camp rangers who are \\"non-exempt\\" employees whose duties are very job-specific, limited to standard hours or equivalent labor rules, and paid by hourly wage. The BSA greatly values these non-exempt employees but does not include their positions in the classifications of professional Scouters. Interim field employees In some Councils, the hiring of a full-time executive is difficult. The BSA has authorized those Councils to hire part-time employees, called paraprofessionals, to assist local volunteers with a level of Council support. These men and women are supervised generally by a district or field director, and many of these individuals are hired as district executives or associate district executives upon completion of college and participation in the BSA's field executive training course. District executives, other entry-level professionals, and second-level professionals The Scouting professional who supports the work of volunteers in a district of a local council is the district executive (D.E.). District executives are hired and serve initially as professional trainees until graduation from the BSA National Council District Operations Basic Level 1 (DOB-1) training. Similar entry-level professionals who are assigned to work in Learning for Life divisions strictly with Explorer posts or Learning for Life programs are known as Exploring executives or Learning for Life executives and may have completed a specialized training that is parallel to the DOB-1. DOB-1 is followed by a second training known as District Operations Level 2 (DO2). After 2 years or 30 months of successful tenure, a District Executive (or equivalent) may be promoted to senior district executive (or Learning for Life equivalent), with more responsibilities added to his/her current assignment, or be reassigned to a larger district with other new responsibilities. All of these positions working in districts or divisions are classified as unit-serving executives (often abbreviated as U.S.E.). Some larger districts may hire entry-level professionals as associate district executive (A.D.E.). In a few cases, a district executive may be promoted directly to a specialized role such as finance director to focus on fund-raising or program director to oversee camp operations and other council program support work. Some larger councils have other similar specialized positions which do not involve supervising other professionals. These specialized roles are usually filled by BSA commissioned professionals, and the specialized positions are not counted as Unit-Serving Executives. Field management Once a professional is tenured and experienced, he or she may be promoted to a position where he/she is asked to become the regular manager of one or more professionals in one or more districts. If he/she does this while maintaining the lead role in one district, the manager title will be district director. If the management position is such that each district has a lead district executive assigned, then the management position is called a field director. The term 'field' goes back to the early days of Scouting when 'field executives' worked for the Scout Executive but were not permanently assigned to any district, and all work directly with BSA chartered organizations and units was called then (and still is today) 'field work'. District directors typically are responsible 1 to 3 districts, and field directors are typically responsible for 3 to 5 districts. Because district directors and field directors are usually deeply involved in district operation and working with unit leaders, they are also counted as unit-serving executives. Senior-level management In the larger councils with more than one field director or district director, the council scout executive usually appoints a director of field service (DFS) to manage the field managers and possibly other professionals, and usually to serve as the de facto assistant scout executive. In medium-sized councils without field directors, this role usually retains the title of assistant scout executive, and often includes responsibility for program support and other special functions. Also in larger councils, similar to the director of field service may be other senior-level professionals. The director of finance service would manage at least one finance director and be responsible for the council fund-raising efforts. The director of support service would manage a camping director, program director, and/or other specialized professionals and be responsible for council functions separate from the field managers. Each of these senior-level positions is usually (but not absolutely) a prerequisite to promotion to a council Scout Executive or national council staff position. Scout executives Scout executives are the executive directors of the local councils, and must be commissioned professional Scouters with considerable experience. Each scout executive has been selected by a volunteer committee of the council executive board from a pool of three to six candidates provided by the National Council. According to the BSA's Rules and Regulations, the Scout executive may not be promoted from the council's professional staff that he/she would be supervising if appointed, but instead come from another council or the national council staff. The scout executive normally serves a minimum of four years, and at the continued satisfaction of the council executive board. In addition to management responsibilities, the Scout executive is the corporate secretary of the council, and the principal spokesperson to the local communities of the council. In many cases, the council executive board will refer to the Scout executive as its chief executive officer. Council scout executives are men and women who have served the BSA as professionals for 10 or more years and in some cases 20 to 30 years. Since the 1980s, a number of women have risen through the BSA professional ranks, and there are at least seven women professionals serving in the scout executive position as of 2011. National Council professional staff Regions and areas are subdivisions of the National Council and do not have a corporate status separate from the BSA. Each region is led by the regional director who is a member of the National Council leadership team. The regional director has responsibility for the success of Scouting in his/her region, and works with an elected volunteer board representing the 55 to 70 councils in that region. The primary day-to-day role of the region is to support local council operations through the work of five to seven area directors who each serve as a field supervisor to the various local council Scout executives within his/her Area (a group of 6 to 12 councils in a geographic area consisting of a portion of one or more states). Each region also has 2 or 3 associate regional directors and a small support staff. The National Council is staffed by professionals and support staff working under the direction of the Chief Scout Executive, the majority of whom have worked in local councils... The Chief Scout Executive is selected by a special committee of the National Executive Board, usually from candidates who have worked in multiple council Scout executive positions and one or more senior national leadership roles. The Chief Scout Executive is the BSA chief executive officer responsible for all day-to-day operations of the BSA and senior manager of all national and regional staff, and serves at the continued satisfaction of the National Executive Board.

Plot Kento is a conventional, straightforward, and pretty much boring 26 years old high school teacher quickly on his way towards \\"geezer- hood\\" as he thinks to himself, \\"young people these days...\\" To make matters worse, his girlfriend rejects his once in a lifetime marriage proposal because he frames it in a way that makes it seem that he is only after a housekeeper and baby machine. He then gets drunk and goes home with a man, who turns out to be a new teacher at Kento's school. Thus enters Akira, a dangerously reckless man with a perpetual evil smirk, a ridiculously flamboyant sense of style, drop-dead gorgeous looks, an endlessly annoying personality and a libido that just keeps going and going. Despite Kento's previous dream of family and Akira's fear of abandonment, the two continue their relationship over a period of three years. Reception Casey Brienza, writing for Graphic Novel Reporter, felt that Future Lovers was one of Kunieda's best works, and that it would attract a wider readership than only BL fans, due to the \\"real\\" and adult characterizations, and the \\"message of tolerance and self- acceptance\\", which Brienza regards as being rare in BL works. Catherine Farmar, writing for Comics Village, enjoyed the main story of the work, but was affronted that there was no warning that Winter Rabbit was an incest story.Future Lovers 1 (Saika Kunieda) Michelle Smith, writing for PopCultureShock, initially felt the circular arguments between the main characters were a flaw in the writing, but then realized that this was actually a realistic portrayal of a relationship. She also enjoyed the humor of the work and the strong characterizations, feeling that the story was more slice of life showing a relationship than a romance.Future Lovers, Vols. 1-2 David Welsh, writing for The Comics Reporter, enjoyed the balance in the story between \\"life issues and love issues\\", and found Winter Rabbit \\"pedestrian\\" when compared to the title story.Flipped!: David Welsh On Recent Yaoi Manga Works Of Note References Further reading * External links * 2008 manga Aurora Publishing (United States) Manga anthologies Romantic comedy anime and manga Yaoi anime and manga ","title":"Future Lovers (manga)"},{"id":"25107412","text":"Huashanli Station (Chinese: ÂçéÂ±±ÈáåÁ´ô) is an elevated rapid transit station located in Hexi District, Tianjin, China.

He is an important figure in Spanish comics, creating such popular characters as Gustavo and Peter Pank early in his career, and more recently Bard√≠n. His clear line style (indebted to the Valencian tradition) tells humorous, angry, and sad, surrealistic stories.Spanish Fever: - Page 169 1606999443 Santiago Garcia - 2016 Max was born in Barcelona in 1956. An illustrator for the press, literature and philosophy books, and a prolific and celebrated cartoonist, Max has won the Premio Nacional del C√≥mic (2007, for Bard√≠n el Superrealista [Bard√≠n the Superrealist]), ... Childhood and youth Capdevila was born in Barcelona on 17 September 1956. His early reading was dominated by publications of the Bruguera Publishing house, such as TBO, Pumby, and Jaimito. He later came across American classics such as Flash Gordon and The Phantom and the Franco- Belgian albums of Asterix and The Adventures of Tintin. In 1973 he joined the group El Rrollo (which included, among others, and Javier Mariscal), publishing his first comic strips in their fanzine The Masked Rrollo, which he also sold in the streets of Barcelona. At this time, Capdevila was discovering underground comics, and in particular the work of Robert Crumb, who became his first great influence. As a student he joined the Faculty of Fine Arts, with the goal of becoming a painter, but eventually felt more attracted by the narrative capacities of the comic strip, where his career ended up. In these years he published in magazines such as Matarratos (Rat Poison), Star, Butifarra and Integral. Career In 1979 El V√≠bora (The Viper) was created, and Max was part of the founding artistic team. He used a character he had created previously, Gustavo (revolutionary, environmentalist, and anarchist) and in 1983 Peter Pank (parodying both the animation of Walt Disney and urban tribes). In 1984, coinciding with the birth of his daughter, he moved to Majorca, the home city of his wife. In that year he published El carnaval de los ciervos (The carnival of the red deer), which was an important aesthetic and thematic change. Graphically, his new influence was Yves Chaland; narratively, it was his first foray info mythological and fantastic themes, characteristic of his work from then on. He created La muerte h√∫meda (the humid death), El beso secreto (the secret kiss) and then El canto del gallo (the crow of the rooster), a work in which the new influence of Belgian illustrator Ever Meulen is evident. Later years With Mujeres fatales, published in 1989, he worked directly for the French market. This offered the advantages of greater professionalism and a better pay, but he felt that the editorial requirements constrained his creativity. After this, he produced other commissioned works: La biblioteca de Turp√≠n (The library of Turp√≠n), El jugador de los Dioses (The player of the Gods) and Alicia en el Pa√≠s Virtual (Alice in Virtual Land). By this time, his main professional occupation was no longer comics, but illustration and design. In these fields, Max's work is very broad, including covers for The New Yorker, creating the mascot for the centenary of football club Barcelona, and the execution of an animated short for the series Microfilm on the television channel Cineman√≠a. Part of this graphic work has been compiled in the volume Espiasue√±os. Short comic strips such as Los invasores (the invaders) and La construcci√≥n de la torre (the construction of the tower) and an unfinished graphical novel of more than 200 pages called El mapa de la oscuridad (the map of the dark) show a further development in style and a distancing from the clear line, towards a more sober tone with a broken line. The influence of Art Spiegelman's Maus, appears to have allowed greater narrative depth. By 1993 Capdevila was working independently of the industry. He created the comic strip Nosotros somos los muertos (we are the dead), a tough story about the war in the Balkans. Self- published as a fanzine photocopied and sold at the International Comic Fair in Barcelona, it became the germ of the magazine of the same name (also well known by its initials NSLM). Until the last issue of NSLM in 2007, it published the works of some of the most exciting international cartoonists and illustrators. 2005 saw the publication of an adaptation of chapter 26 of Don Quixote in the anthology Lanza en astillero (lance in the shipyard). His latest creation is Bard√≠n, a character used in different formats and publications It demonstrates the influence of Chris Ware, but with touches of the Bruguera school. Bardin has freed Capdevila from editorial impositions, leaving him free to experiment and to give free rein to his imagination. Works and style Max is one of the few Spanish strip cartoonists from the mid-1970s who remains active. During this long trajectory his style has undergone a constant evolution. The author himself has never denied the influence of other artists such as Robert Crumb, Yves Chaland, and Ever Meulen in various phases of his career. This path of experimentation has increased in the recent years, when - free of external editorial impositions - he has had total creative freedom. Examples of this are the creation of the magazine Nosostros somos los muertos, that he co-edits with Pere Joan, and the creation of his latest character Bard√≠n, which mixes a very wide range of subjects and aesthetics including humor and philosophical reflections in an anarchic publication style that mixes formats.

Christianity in the Middle Ages covers the history of Christianity from the Fall of the Western Roman Empire () until the Fall of Constantinople (1453), which is usually taken to mark the end of the Middle Ages in the History of Europe. In Christianity's ancient Pentarchy, five patriarchies held special eminence: the sees of Rome, Constantinople, Jerusalem, Antioch, and Alexandria. The prestige of most of these sees depended in part on their apostolic founders, or in the case of Byzantium/Constantinople, that it was the new seat of the continuing Eastern Roman, or Byzantine Empire. These bishops considered themselves the successors of those apostles.Woollcombe, K.J. \\"The Ministry and the Order of the Church in the Works of the Fathers\\" in The Historic Episcopate. Kenneth M. Carey (Ed.). Dacre Press (1954) p.31f In addition, all five cities were early centres of Christianity. Early Middle Ages (476‚Äì799) Mosaic of Justinian I in the church of San Vitale, Ravenna, Italy The Early Middle Ages commenced with the deposition of the last western Roman emperor in 476, to be followed by the barbarian king, Odoacer, to the coronation of Charlemagne as \\"Emperor of the Romans\\" by Pope Leo III in Rome on Christmas Day, 800. The year 476, however, is a rather artificial division.R. Gerberding and Jo Anne H. Moran Cruz, Medieval Worlds: An Introduction to European History 300‚Äì1492 (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 2004), p. 33. In the East, Roman imperial rule continued through the period historians now call the Byzantine Empire. Even in the West, where imperial political control gradually declined, distinctly Roman culture continued long afterwards; thus historians today prefer to speak of a \\"transformation of the Roman world\\" rather than a \\"fall of the Roman Empire.\\" The advent of the Early Middle Ages was a gradual and often localised process whereby, in the West, rural areas became power centres whilst urban areas declined. With the Muslim invasions of the seventh century, the Western (Latin) and Eastern (Greek) areas of Christianity began to take on distinctive shapes. Whereas in the East the Church maintained its strength, in the West the Bishops of Rome (i.e., the Popes) were forced to adapt more quickly and flexibly to drastically changing circumstances. In particular whereas the bishops of the East maintained clear allegiance to the Eastern Roman Emperor, the Bishop of Rome, while maintaining nominal allegiance to the Eastern Emperor, was forced to negotiate delicate balances with the \\"barbarian rulers\\" of the former Western provinces. Although the greater number of Christians remained in the East, the developments in the West would set the stage for major developments in the Christian world during the later centuries. Early Medieval Papacy After the Italian peninsula fell into warfare and turmoil due to the barbarian tribes, the Emperor Justinian I attempted to reassert imperial dominion in Italy from the East, against the Gothic aristocracy. The subsequent campaigns were more or less successful, and an Imperial Exarchate was established for Italy, but imperial influence was limited. The Lombards then invaded the weakened peninsula, and Rome was essentially left to fend for itself. The failure of the East to send aid resulted in the popes themselves feeding the city with grain from papal estates, negotiating treaties, paying protection money to Lombard warlords, and, failing that, hiring soldiers to defend the city.Richards, Jeffrey. The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476‚Äì752 (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979) p. 36 Eventually the popes turned to others for support, especially the Franks. Spread beyond the Roman Empire Sergei Ivanov As the political boundaries of the Roman Empire diminished and then collapsed in the West, Christianity spread beyond the old borders of the Empire and into lands that had never been under Rome. =Irish missionaries= Beginning in the fifth century, a unique culture developed around the Irish Sea consisting of what today would be called Wales and Ireland. In this environment, Christianity spread from Roman Britain to Ireland, especially aided by the missionary activity of St. Patrick with his first-order of 'patrician clergy', active missionary priests accompanying or following him, typically Britons or Irish ordained by him and his successors. Patrick had been captured into slavery in Ireland and, following his escape and later consecration as bishop, he returned to the isle that had enslaved him so that he could bring them the Gospel. Soon, Irish missionaries such as Columba and Columbanus spread this Christianity, with its distinctively Irish features, to Scotland and the Continent. One such feature was the system of private penitence, which replaced the former practice of penance as a public rite.On the development of penitential practice, see McNeill & Gamer, Medieval Handbooks of Penance, (Columba University Press, 1938) pp. 9‚Äì54 =Anglo-Saxons, English= Although southern Britain had been a Roman province, in 407 the imperial legions left the isle, and the Roman elite followed. Some time later that century, various barbarian tribes went from raiding and pillaging the island to settling and invading. These tribes are referred to as the \\"Anglo-Saxons\\", predecessors of the English. They were entirely pagan, having never been part of the Empire, and although they experienced Christian influence from the surrounding peoples, they were converted by the mission of St. Augustine sent by Pope Gregory the Great. The majority of the remaining British population converted from Christianity back to their Pagan roots. Contrary to popular belief, the conversion of Anglo- Saxons to Christianity was incredibly slow. The Anglo-Saxons had little interest in changing their religion and even initially looked down upon Christianity due to conquering the Christian British people decades earlier. It took almost a century to convert only the aristocracy of the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity with many still converting back to Paganism. After this, the common folk took a few hundred more years to convert to Christianity and their reasoning for converting was in large part due to the nobility.Mayr-Harting, H. (1991). The coming of Christianity to Anglo-Saxon England. University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press. Originally, Anglo-Saxon leaders claimed divine descent while taking part in many rituals and practices for Paganism but after their conversion they in turn became spiritual leaders for Christianity in Britain. Soon Anglo-Saxons started to incorporate their old Pagan stories and figures into Christianity, such as the Pagan god Woden becoming sixteenth in descent from 'Sceaf, Noah's son in the Bible.Chaney, W. A. (1970). The cult of kingship in Anglo-Saxon England; the transition from paganism to Christianity. Manchester, Eng.: Manchester University Press. Later, under Archbishop Theodore, the Anglo-Saxons enjoyed a golden age of culture and scholarship. Soon, important English missionaries such as SS. Wilfrid, Willibrord, Lullus and Boniface would begin evangelising their Saxon relatives in Germany. =Franks= Saint Remigius baptises Clovis. The largely Christian Gallo-Roman inhabitants of Gaul (modern France) were overrun by Germanic Franks in the early 5th century. The native inhabitants were persecuted until the Frankish King, Clovis I converted from paganism to Roman Catholicism in 496. Clovis insisted that his fellow nobles follow suit, strengthening his newly established kingdom by uniting the faith of the rulers with that of the ruled. =Frisians of the Low Countries= In 698, the Northumbrian Benedictine monk, Willibrord was commissioned by Pope Sergius I as bishop of the Frisians in what is now the Netherlands. Willibrord established a church in Utrecht. Much of Willibrord's work was wiped out when the pagan Radbod, king of the Frisians destroyed many Christian centres between 716 and 719. In 717, the English missionary Boniface was sent to aid Willibrord, re-establishing churches in Frisia and continuing to preach throughout the pagan lands of Germany. Boniface was killed by pagans in 754. Iconoclasm Andrei Rublev's Trinity Iconoclasm as a movement began within the Eastern Christian Byzantine church in the early 8th century, following a series of heavy military reverses against the Muslims. There was a Christian movement in the eighth and ninth centuries against the worship of imagery, caused by worry that the art might be idolatrous. Sometime between 726‚Äì730 the Byzantine Emperor Leo III the Isaurian ordered the removal of an image of Jesus prominently placed over the Chalke gate, the ceremonial entrance to the Great Palace of Constantinople, and its replacement with a cross. This was followed by orders banning the pictorial representation of the family of Christ, subsequent Christian saints, and biblical scenes. In the West, Pope Gregory III held two synods at Rome and condemned Leo's actions. In Leo's realms, the Iconoclast Council at Hieria, 754 ruled that the culture of holy portraits (see icon) was not of a Christian origin and therefore heretical.Epitome, Iconoclast Council at Hieria, 754 The movement destroyed much of the Christian church's early artistic history, to the great loss of subsequent art and religious historians. The iconoclastic movement itself was later defined as heretical in 787 under the Seventh Ecumenical council, but enjoyed a brief resurgence between 815 and 842. High Middle Ages (800‚Äì1300) Carolingian Renaissance The Carolingian Renaissance was a period of intellectual and cultural revival during the late 8th century and 9th century, mostly during the reigns of Charlemagne and Louis the Pious. There was an increase of literature, the arts, architecture, jurisprudence, liturgical and scriptural studies. The period also saw the development of Carolingian minuscule, the ancestor of modern lower-case script, and the standardisation of Latin which had hitherto become varied and irregular (see Medieval Latin). To address the problems of illiteracy among clergy and court scribes, Charlemagne founded schools and attracted the most learned men from all of Europe to his court, such as Theodulf, Paul the Deacon, Angilbert, Paulinus of Aquileia. Growing tensions between East and West The cracks and fissures in Christian unity which led to the East-West Schism started to become evident as early as the fourth century. Cultural, political, and linguistic differences were often mixed with the theological, leading to schism. The transfer of the Roman capital to Constantinople inevitably brought mistrust, rivalry, and even jealousy to the relations of the two great sees, Rome and Constantinople. It was easy for Rome to be jealous of Constantinople at a time when it was rapidly losing its political prominence. Estrangement was also helped along by the German invasions in the West, which effectively weakened contacts. The rise of Islam with its conquest of most of the Mediterranean coastline (not to mention the arrival of the pagan Slavs in the Balkans at the same time) further intensified this separation by driving a physical wedge between the two worlds. The once homogenous unified world of the Mediterranean was fast vanishing. Communication between the Greek East and Latin West by the 600s had become dangerous and practically ceased.The Great Schism: The Estrangement of Eastern and Western Christendom Two basic problems ‚Äî the nature of the primacy of the bishop of Rome and the theological implications of adding a clause to the Nicene Creed, known as the filioque clause ‚Äî were involved. These doctrinal issues were first openly discussed in Photius's patriarchate. Largely extinct Church of the East and its largest extent during the Middle Ages. By the fifth century, Christendom was divided into a pentarchy of five sees with Rome accorded a primacy. The four Eastern sees of the pentarchy, considered this determined by canonical decision and did not entail hegemony of any one local church or patriarchate over the others. However, Rome began to interpret her primacy in terms of sovereignty, as a God-given right involving universal jurisdiction in the Church. The collegial and conciliar nature of the Church, in effect, was gradually abandoned in favour of supremacy of unlimited papal power over the entire Church. These ideas were finally given systematic expression in the West during the Gregorian Reform movement of the eleventh century. The Eastern churches viewed Rome's understanding of the nature of episcopal power as being in direct opposition to the Church's essentially conciliar structure and thus saw the two ecclesiologies as mutually antithetical. For them, specifically, Simon Peter's primacy could never be the exclusive prerogative of any one bishop. All bishops must, like St. Peter, confess Jesus as the Christ and, as such, all are Peter's successors. The churches of the East gave the Roman See, primacy but not supremacy. The Pope being the first among equals, but not infallible and not with absolute authority. The other major irritant to Eastern Christendom was the Western use of the filioque clause‚Äîmeaning \\"and the Son\\"‚Äîin the Nicene Creed . This too developed gradually and entered the Creed over time. The issue was the addition by the West of the Latin clause filioque to the Creed, as in \\"the Holy Spirit... who proceeds from the Father and the Son,\\" where the original Creed, sanctioned by the councils and still used today, by the Eastern Orthodox simply states \\"the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father.\\" The Eastern Church argued that the phrase had been added unilaterally and, therefore, illegitimately, since the East had never been consulted.History of Russian Philosophy by Nikolai Lossky Quoting Aleksey Khomyakov pg 87. In the final analysis, only another ecumenical council could introduce such an alteration. Indeed, the councils, which drew up the original Creed, had expressly forbidden any subtraction or addition to the text. In addition to this ecclesiological issue, the Eastern Church also considered the filioque clause unacceptable on dogmatic grounds. Theologically, the Latin interpolation was unacceptable since it implied that the Spirit now had two sources of origin and procession, the Father and the Son, rather than the Father alone.The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church by Vladimir Lossky, SVS Press, 1997. () James Clarke & Co Ltd, 1991. () Photian schism In the 9th century AD, a controversy arose between Eastern (Byzantine, later Orthodox) and Western (Latin, later Roman Catholic) Christianity that was precipitated by the opposition of the Roman Pope John VIII to the appointment by the Byzantine emperor Michael III of Photius I to the position of patriarch of Constantinople. Photios was refused an apology by the pope for previous points of dispute between the East and West. Photius refused to accept the supremacy of the pope in Eastern matters or accept the filioque clause. The Latin delegation at the council of his consecration pressed him to accept the clause in order to secure their support. The controversy also involved Eastern and Western ecclesiastical jurisdictional rights in the Bulgarian church, as well as a doctrinal dispute over the Filioque (\\"and from the Son\\") clause. That had been added to the Nicene Creed by the Latin church, which was later the theological breaking point in the ultimate Great East-West Schism in the eleventh century. Photius did provide concession on the issue of jurisdictional rights concerning Bulgaria and the papal legates made do with his return of Bulgaria to Rome. This concession, however, was purely nominal, as Bulgaria's return to the Byzantine rite in 870 had already secured for it an autocephalous church. Without the consent of Boris I of Bulgaria, the papacy was unable to enforce any of its claims. East-West Schism The religious distribution after the East‚ÄìWest Schism in 1054 The East-West Schism, or Great Schism, separated the Church into Western (Latin) and Eastern (Greek) branches, i.e., Western Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. It was the first major division since certain groups in the East rejected the decrees of the Council of Chalcedon (see Oriental Orthodoxy), and was far more significant. Though normally dated to 1054, the East-West Schism was actually the result of an extended period of estrangement between Latin and Greek Christendom over the nature of papal primacy and certain doctrinal matters like the filioque, but intensified by cultural and linguistic differences. The \\"official\\" schism in 1054 was the excommunication of Patriarch Michael Cerularius of Constantinople, followed by his excommunication of papal legates. Attempts at reconciliation were made in 1274 (by the Second Council of Lyon) and in 1439 (by the Council of Basel), but in each case the eastern hierarchs who consented to the unions were repudiated by the Orthodox as a whole, though reconciliation was achieved between the West and what are now called the \\"Eastern Rite Catholic Churches.\\" More recently, in 1965 the mutual excommunications were rescinded by the Pope and the Patriarch of Constantinople, though schism remains. Both groups are descended from the Early Church, both acknowledge the apostolic succession of each other's bishops, and the validity of each other's sacraments. Though both acknowledge the primacy of the Bishop of Rome, Eastern Orthodoxy understands this as a primacy of honour with limited or no ecclesiastical authority in other dioceses. The Orthodox East perceived the Papacy as taking on monarchical characteristics that were not in line with the church's traditional relationship with the emperor. The final breach is often considered to have arisen after the capture and sacking of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Crusades against Christians in the East by Roman Catholic crusaders was not exclusive to the Mediterranean though (see also the Northern Crusades and the Battle of the Ice). The sacking of Constantinople, especially the Church of Holy Wisdom and the Church of the Holy Apostles, and establishment of the Latin Empire as a seeming attempt to supplant the Orthodox Byzantine Empire in 1204 is viewed with some rancour to the present day. Many in the East saw the actions of the West as a prime determining factor in the weakening of Byzantium. This led to the Empire's eventual conquest and fall to Islam. In 2004, Pope John Paul II extended a formal apology for the sacking of Constantinople in 1204; the apology was formally accepted by Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople. Many things that were stolen during this time: holy relics, riches, and many other items, are still held in various Western European cities, particularly Venice. Monastic Reform A view of the Abbey of Cluny. =Cluny= From the 6th century onward most of the monasteries in the West were of the Benedictine Order. Owing to the stricter adherence to a reformed Benedictine rule, the abbey of Cluny became the acknowledged leader of western monasticism from the later 10th century. Cluny created a large, federated order in which the administrators of subsidiary houses served as deputies of the abbot of Cluny and answered to him. The Cluniac spirit was a revitalising influence on the Norman church, at its height from the second half of the 10th centuries through the early 12th. =C√Æteaux= Bernard of Clairvaux, in a medieval illuminated manuscript. The next wave of monastic reform came with the Cistercian Movement. The first Cistercian abbey was founded in 1098, at C√Æteaux Abbey. The keynote of Cistercian life was a return to a literal observance of the Benedictine rule, rejecting the developments of the Benedictines. The most striking feature in the reform was the return to manual labour, and especially to field-work. Inspired by Bernard of Clairvaux, the primary builder of the Cistercians, they became the main force of technological diffusion in medieval Europe. By the end of the 12th century the Cistercian houses numbered 500, and at its height in the 15th century the order claimed to have close to 750 houses. Most of these were built in wilderness areas, and played a major part in bringing such isolated parts of Europe into economic cultivation. =Mendicant orders= A third level of monastic reform was provided by the establishment of the Mendicant orders. Commonly known as friars, mendicants live under a monastic rule with traditional vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, but they emphasise preaching, missionary activity, and education, in a secluded monastery. Beginning in the 12th century, the Franciscan order was instituted by the followers of Francis of Assisi, and thereafter the Dominican order was begun by St. Dominic. Investiture Controversy Henry IV at the gate of Canossa, by August von Heyden The Investiture Controversy, or Lay investiture controversy, was the most significant conflict between secular and religious powers in medieval Europe. It began as a dispute in the 11th century between the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV, and Pope Gregory VII concerning who would appoint bishops (investiture). The end of lay investiture threatened to undercut the power of the Empire and the ambitions of noblemen for the benefit of Church reform. Bishops collected revenues from estates attached to their bishopric. Noblemen who held lands (fiefdoms) hereditarily passed those lands on within their family. However, because bishops had no legitimate children, when a bishop died it was the king's right to appoint a successor. So, while a king had little recourse in preventing noblemen from acquiring powerful domains via inheritance and dynastic marriages, a king could keep careful control of lands under the domain of his bishops. Kings would bestow bishoprics to members of noble families whose friendship he wished to secure. Furthermore, if a king left a bishopric vacant, then he collected the estates' revenues until a bishop was appointed, when in theory he was to repay the earnings. The infrequence of this repayment was an obvious source of dispute. The Church wanted to end this lay investiture because of the potential corruption, not only from vacant sees but also from other practices such as simony. Thus, the Investiture Contest was part of the Church's attempt to reform the episcopate and provide better pastoral care. Pope Gregory VII issued the Dictatus Papae, which declared that the pope alone could appoint or depose bishops, or translate them to other sees. Henry IV's rejection of the decree lead to his excommunication and a ducal revolt; eventually Henry received absolution after dramatic public penance barefoot in Alpine snow and cloaked in a hairshirt (see Walk to Canossa), though the revolt and conflict of investiture continued. Likewise, a similar controversy occurred in England between King Henry I and St. Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, over investiture and ecclesiastical revenues collected by the king during an episcopal vacancy. The English dispute was resolved by the Concordat of London, 1107, where the king renounced his claim to invest bishops but continued to require an oath of fealty from them upon their election. This was a partial model for the Concordat of Worms (Pactum Calixtinum), which resolved the Imperial investiture controversy with a compromise that allowed secular authorities some measure of control but granted the selection of bishops to their cathedral canons. As a symbol of the compromise, lay authorities invested bishops with their secular authority symbolised by the lance, and ecclesiastical authorities invested bishops with their spiritual authority symbolised by the ring and the staff. Crusades The Crusades were a series of military conflicts conducted by Christian knights for the defense of Christians and for the expansion of Christian domains. Generally, the Crusades refer to the campaigns in the Holy Land sponsored by the papacy against invading Muslim forces. There were other crusades against Islamic forces in southern Spain, southern Italy, and Sicily, as well as the campaigns of Teutonic knights against pagan strongholds in Eastern Europe (see Northern Crusades). A few crusades such as the Fourth Crusade were waged within Christendom against groups that were considered heretical and schismatic (also see the Battle of the Ice and the Albigensian Crusade). Krak des Chevaliers was built in the County of Tripoli by the Knights Hospitaller during the Crusades. The Holy Land had been part of the Roman Empire, and thus Byzantine Empire, until the Islamic conquests of the seventh and eighth centuries. Thereafter, Christians had generally been permitted to visit the sacred places in the Holy Land until 1071, when the Seljuk Turks closed Christian pilgrimages and assailed the Byzantines, defeating them at the Battle of Manzikert. Emperor Alexius I asked for aid from Pope Urban II (1088‚Äì1099) for help against Islamic aggression. Urban II called upon the knights of Christendom in a speech made at the Council of Clermont on 27 November 1095, combining the idea of pilgrimage to the Holy Land with that of waging a holy war against the invading forces. In the First Crusade, after nine months of war of attrition, a traitor named Firuz led the Franks into the city of Antioch in 1098. However, less than a week, the might of an army numbering hundreds of thousands led by Kerbogah arrived and besieged the city. The crusaders reportedly had only 30,000 men and the Turks outnumbers them three to one; facing desertion and starvation, Bohemond was officially chosen to lead the crusader army in June 1098. On the morning of 28 June, the crusader army, consisting of mostly dismounted knights and foot soldiers because most horses had died at that point, sallied out to attack the Turks, and broke the line of Kerbogah's army, allowing the crusaders to gain complete control of the Antioch and its surroundings. The Second Crusade occurred in 1145 when Edessa was retaken by Islamic forces. Jerusalem would be held until 1187 and the Third Crusade, famous for the battles between Richard the Lionheart and Saladin. The Fourth Crusade, begun by Innocent III in 1202, intended to retake the Holy Land but was soon subverted by Venetians who used the forces to sack the Christian city of Zara. Innocent excommunicated the Venetians and crusaders. Eventually the crusaders arrived in Constantinople, but due to strife which arose between them and the Byzantines, rather than proceed to the Holy Land the crusaders instead sacked Constantinople and other parts of Asia Minor effectively establishing the Latin Empire of Constantinople in Greece and Asia Minor. This was effectively the last crusade sponsored by the papacy; later crusades were sponsored by individuals. Thus, though Jerusalem was held for nearly a century and other strongholds in the Near East would remain in Christian possession much longer, the crusades in the Holy Land ultimately failed to establish permanent Christian kingdoms. The European's defeat can in no small part be attributed to the excellent marshal prowess of the Mameluke and Turks, who both utilized agile mounted archer in open battle and Greek fire in siege defense, however, ultimately it was the inability for the Crusader leaders to command coherently that doom the military campaign. In addition, the failure of the missioners to convert the Mongols to the Christianity thwarted the hope for a Tartar- Frank alliance. Mongols, later on converted to Islam. Islamic expansion into Europe would renew and remain a threat for centuries culminating in the campaigns of Suleiman the Magnificent in the sixteenth century. On the other hand, the crusades in southern Spain, southern Italy, and Sicily eventually lead to the demise of Islamic power in the regions; the Teutonic knights expanded Christian domains in Eastern Europe, and the much less frequent crusades within Christendom, such as the Albigensian Crusade, achieved their goal of maintaining doctrinal unity.For such an analysis, see Brian Tierney and Sidney Painter, Western Europe in the Middle Ages 300‚Äì1475. 6th ed. (McGraw-Hill 1998) Medieval inquisition The Medieval Inquisition officially started in 1231, when Pope Gregory IX appointed the first inquisitors to serve as papal agents to remove heresy. Heretics were seen as a menace to the Church and the first group dealt with by the inquisitors were the Cathars of southern France. The main tool used by the inquisitors was interrogation that often featured the use of torture followed by having heretics burned at the stake. After about a century this first medieval inquisition came to a conclusion. A new inquisition called the Spanish Inquisition was created by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella in order to consolidate their rule. This new inquisition was separated from the Roman Church and the inquisition that came before it. At first it was primarily directed at Jews who converted to Christianity because many were suspicious that they did not actually convert to Christianity. Later it spread to targeting Muslims and the various peoples of the Americas and Asia.Murphy, C. (2012). God's Jury: The Inquisition and the Making of the Modern World. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. The inquisitions in combination with the Albigensian Crusade were fairly successful in suppressing heresy. Rise of universities Modern western universities have their origins directly in the Medieval Church. They began as cathedral schools, and all students were considered clerics. This was a benefit as it placed the students under ecclesiastical jurisdiction and thus imparted certain legal immunities and protections. The cathedral schools eventually became partially detached from the cathedrals and formed their own institutions, the earliest being the University of Paris (c. 1150), the University of Bologna (1088), and the University of Oxford (1096). Spread of Christianity =Conversion of the Scandinavians= Early evangelisation in Scandinavia was begun by Ansgar, Archbishop of Bremen, \\"Apostle of the North\\". Ansgar, a native of Amiens, was sent with a group of monks to Jutland Denmark in around 820 at the time of the pro-Christian Jutish king Harald Klak. The mission was only partially successful, and Ansgar returned two years later to Germany, after Harald had been driven out of his kingdom. In 829 Ansgar went to Birka on Lake M√§laren, Sweden, with his aide friar Witmar, and a small congregation was formed in 831 which included the king's own steward Hergeir. Conversion was slow, however, and most Scandinavian lands were only completely Christianised at the time of rulers such as Saint Canute IV of Denmark and Olaf I of Norway in the years following AD 1000\\\\. Stavronikita monastery, South-East view =Conversion of East and South Slavs= Mt. Radho≈°≈• Though by 800 Western Europe was ruled entirely by Christian kings, Eastern Europe remained an area of missionary activity. For example, in the ninth century SS. Cyril and Methodius had extensive missionary success in Eastern Europe among the Slavic peoples, translating the Bible and liturgy into Slavonic. The Baptism of Kiev in the 988 spread Christianity throughout Kievan Rus', establishing Christianity among the Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. In the ninth and tenth centuries, Christianity made great inroads into Eastern Europe, including Kievan Rus'. The evangelisation, or Christianisation, of the Slavs was initiated by one of Byzantium's most learned churchmen ‚Äî the Patriarch Photius. The Byzantine emperor Michael III chose Cyril and Methodius in response to a request from Rastislav, the king of Moravia who wanted missionaries that could minister to the Moravians in their own language. The two brothers spoke the local Slavonic vernacular and translated the Bible and many of the prayer books. As the translations prepared by them were copied by speakers of other dialects, the hybrid literary language Old Church Slavonic was created. Methodius later went on to convert the Serbs. Some of the disciples returned to Bulgaria where they were welcomed by the Bulgarian Tsar Boris I who viewed the Slavonic liturgy as a way to counteract Greek influence in the country. In a short time the disciples of Cyril and Methodius managed to prepare and instruct the future Slavic clergy into the Glagolitic alphabet and the biblical texts. Methodius and Cyril were mainly living and working in the Macedonian city of Ohrid, which they made the religious capital of the Balkans. Bulgaria was officially recognised as a patriarchate by Constantinople in 945, Serbia in 1346, and Russia in 1589. All these nations, however, had been converted long before these dates. The missionaries to the East and South Slavs had great success in part because they used the people's native language rather than Latin as the Roman priests did, or Greek. Mission to Great Moravia Church of St. Margaret of Antioch, Kopƒçany (Kopƒçany, Slovakia, 9th-10th century) - the only preserved building from the time of Great Moravia. When king Rastislav of Moravia asked Byzantium for teachers who could minister to the Moravians in their own language, Byzantine emperor Michael III chose two brothers, Cyril and Methodius. As their mother was a Slav from the hinterlands of Thessaloniki, the two brothers had been raised speaking the local Slavonic vernacular. Once commissioned, they immediately set about creating an alphabet, the Cyrillic script; they then translated the Scripture and the liturgy into Slavonic. This Slavic dialect became the basis of Old Church Slavonic which later evolved into Church Slavonic which is the common liturgical language still used by the Russian Orthodox Church and other Slavic Orthodox Christians. The missionaries to the East and South Slavs had great success in part because they used the people's native language rather than Latin or Greek. In Great Moravia, Constantine and Methodius encountered Frankish missionaries from Germany, representing the western or Latin branch of the Church, and more particularly representing the Holy Roman Empire as founded by Charlemagne, and committed to linguistic, and cultural uniformity. They insisted on the use of the Latin liturgy, and they regarded Moravia and the Slavic peoples as part of their rightful mission field. When friction developed, the brothers, unwilling to be a cause of dissension among Christians, travelled to Rome to see the Pope, seeking an agreement that would avoid quarrelling between missionaries in the field. Constantine entered a monastery in Rome, taking the name Cyril, by which he is now remembered. However, he died only a few weeks thereafter. Pope Adrian II gave Methodius the title of Archbishop of Sirmium (now Sremska Mitrovica in Serbia) and sent him back in 869, with jurisdiction over all of Moravia and Pannonia, and authorisation to use the Slavonic Liturgy. Soon, however, Prince Ratislav, who had originally invited the brothers to Moravia, died, and his successor did not support Methodius. In 870 the Frankish king Louis and his bishops deposed Methodius at a synod at Ratisbon, and imprisoned him for a little over two years. Pope John VIII secured his release, but instructed him to stop using the Slavonic Liturgy. In 878, Methodius was summoned to Rome on charges of heresy and using Slavonic. This time Pope John was convinced by the arguments that Methodius made in his defence and sent him back cleared of all charges, and with permission to use Slavonic. The Carolingian bishop who succeeded him, Witching, suppressed the Slavonic Liturgy and forced the followers of Methodius into exile. Many found refuge with King Boris of Bulgaria (852‚Äì889), under whom they reorganised a Slavic-speaking Church. Meanwhile, Pope John's successors adopted a Latin-only policy which lasted for centuries. Conversion of the Serbs and Bulgarians Methodius later went on to convert the Serbs. Some of the disciples, namely St. Kliment, St. Naum who were of noble Bulgarian descent and St. Angelaruis, returned to Bulgaria where they were welcomed by the Bulgarian Tsar Boris I who viewed the Slavonic liturgy as a way to counteract Greek influence in the country. Prior to Christianity, the majority of Bulgaria was Pagan. In 876, Tsar Boris I adopted Christianity from Constantinople, making it the official religion of Bulgaria. Shortly after, Boris I accepted many Christian missionaries into the country. At the time, the majority of the missionaries were Byzantines and Bulgarians. The conversion of Bulgaria was particularly painful and bloody as many people were converted through force. However, many continued to secretly worship their pagan gods. Constantinople and Rome contended to attract the powerful Bulgaria through the use of religion. After the split of the Eastern and Western churches in the 11th century, the Eastern church located in Constantinople took control of Bulgaria implementing Orthodox Christianity. Starting in the 14th century, the Ottomans conquered many places in the Balkans including Bulgaria, which led to many new forced and voluntary converts to Islam. Despite the constant warfare, the Christians and Muslims lived together in relative peace in Bulgaria. The two religious groups influenced each other's cultures and religious practices.Sarieva, I. (1995). Some Problems of the Religious History of Bulgaria. Occasional Papers on Religion in Eastern Europe, 15(1).core.ac.uk In a short time the disciples of Cyril and Methodius managed to prepare and instruct the future Slav Bulgarian clergy into the Glagolitic alphabet and the biblical texts and in AD 893, Bulgaria expelled its Greek clergy and proclaimed the Slavonic language as the official language of the church and the state. Conversion of the Rus' Baptism of Vladimir The success of the conversion of the Bulgarians facilitated the conversion of other East Slavic peoples, most notably the Rus', predecessors of Belarusians, Russians, and Ukrainians, as well as Rusyns. By the beginning of the eleventh century most of the pagan Slavic world, including Russia, Bulgaria and Serbia, had been converted to Byzantine Christianity. The traditional event associated with the conversion of Russia is the baptism of Vladimir of Kiev in 988, on which occasion he was also married to the Byzantine princess Anna, the sister of the Byzantine Emperor Basil II. However, Christianity is documented to have predated this event in the city of Kiev and in Georgia. Today the Russian Orthodox Church is the largest of the Orthodox Churches. Late Middle Ages (1300‚Äì1499) Hesychast Controversy Gregory Palamas ;Barlaam of Calabria About the year 1337 Hesychasm attracted the attention of a learned member of the Orthodox Church, Barlaam of Calabria who at that time held the office of abbot in the Monastery of St Saviour's in Constantinople and who visited Mount Athos. Mount Athos was then at the height of its fame and influence under the reign of Andronicus III Palaeologus and under the 'first-ship' of the Protos Symeon. On Mount Athos, Barlaam encountered Hesychasts and heard descriptions of their practices, also reading the writings of the teacher in Hesychasm of St Gregory Palamas, himself an Athonite monk. Trained in Western Scholastic theology, Barlaam was scandalised by Hesychasm and began to combat it both orally and in his writings. As a private teacher of theology in the Western Scholastic mode, Barlaam propounded a more intellectual and propositional approach to the knowledge of God than the Hesychasts taught. Hesychasm is a form of constant purposeful prayer or experiential prayer, explicitly referred to as contemplation. Descriptions of the Hesychast practices can be found in the Philokalia, The Way of a Pilgrim, and St. John Climacus' The Ladder of Divine Ascent. Barlaam took exception to, as heretical and blasphemous, the doctrine entertained by the Hesychasts as to the nature of the uncreated light, the experience of which was said to be the goal of Hesychast practice. It was maintained by the Hesychasts to be of divine origin and to be identical to that light which had been manifested to Jesus' disciples on Mount Tabor at the Transfiguration. This Barlaam held to be polytheistic, inasmuch as it postulated two eternal substances, a visible and an invisible God. ;Gregory Palamas On the Hesychast side, the controversy was taken up by St Gregory Palamas, afterwards Archbishop of Thessalonica, who was asked by his fellow monks on Mt Athos to defend Hesychasm from the attacks of Barlaam. St Gregory himself, was well-educated in Greek philosophy. St Gregory defended Hesychasm in the 1340s at three different synods in Constantinople, and he also wrote a number of works in its defence. In these works, St Gregory Palamas uses a distinction, already found in the 4th century in the works of the Cappadocian Fathers, between the energies or operations (Gr. energies) of God and the essence (ousia) of God (see the Essence-Energies distinction). St Gregory taught that the energies or operations of God were uncreated. He taught that the essence of God can never be known by his creations even in the next life, but that his uncreated energies or operations can be known both in this life and in the next, and convey to the Hesychast in this life and to the righteous in the next life a true spiritual knowledge of God (see theoria). In Palamite theology, it is the uncreated energies of God that illumine the Hesychast who has been vouchsafed an experience of the Uncreated Light. Palamas referred to this experience as an apodictic (see Aristotle) validation of God rather than a scholastic contemplative or dialectical validation of God. ;Synods In 1341 the dispute came before a synod held at Constantinople and was presided over by the Emperor Andronicus; the synod, taking into account the regard in which the writings of the pseudo-Dionysius were held, condemned Barlaam, who recanted and returned to Calabria, afterwards becoming a bishop in the Roman Catholic Church. One of Barlaam's friends, Gregory Akindynos, who originally was also a close friend of St Gregory Palamas, took up the controversy, and three other synods on the subject were held, at the second of which the followers of Barlaam gained a brief victory. But in 1351 at a synod under the presidency of the Emperor John VI Cantacuzenus, Hesychast doctrine was established as the doctrine of the Orthodox Church. ;Aftermath Up to this day, the Roman Catholic Church has never fully accepted Hesychasm, especially the distinction between the energies or operations of God and the essence of God, and the notion that those energies or operations of God are uncreated. In Roman Catholic theology as it has developed since the Scholastic period c. 1100‚Äì1500, the essence of God can be known, but only in the next life; the grace of God is always created; and the essence of God is pure act, so that there can be no distinction between the energies or operations and the essence of God (see, e.g., the Summa Theologiae of St Thomas Aquinas). Some of these positions depend on Aristotelian metaphysics. ;Views of modern historians The contemporary historians Cantacuzenus and Nicephorus Gregoras deal very copiously with this subject, taking the Hesychast and Barlaamite sides respectively. Respected fathers of the church have held that these councils that agree that experiential prayer is Orthodox, refer to these as councils as Ecumenical Councils Eight and Nine. Father John S.

Avignon Papacy (1309-1378) and Western Schism (1378-1417)  Avignon (red) and Rome (blue) during the Western Schism The Western Schism, or Papal Schism, was a prolonged period of crisis in Latin Christendom from 1378 to 1416, when there were two or more claimants to the See of Rome and there was conflict concerning the rightful holder of the papacy. The conflict was political, rather than doctrinal, in nature. In 1309, Pope Clement V, due to political considerations, moved to Avignon in southern France and exercised his pontificate there. For sixty-nine years popes resided in Avignon rather than Rome. This was not only an obvious source of confusion but of political animosity as the prestige and influence of the city of Rome waned without a resident pontiff. Though Pope Gregory XI, a Frenchman, returned to Rome in 1378, the strife between Italian and French factions intensified, especially following his subsequent death. In 1378 the conclave, elected an Italian from Naples, Pope Urban VI; his intransigence in office soon alienated the French cardinals, who withdrew to a conclave of their own, asserting the previous election was invalid since its decision had been made under the duress of a riotous mob. They elected one of their own, Robert of Geneva, who took the name Pope Clement VII. By 1379, he was back in the palace of popes in Avignon, while Urban VI remained in Rome. For nearly forty years, there were two papal curias and two sets of cardinals, each electing a new pope for Rome or Avignon when death created a vacancy. Each pope lobbied for support among kings and princes who played them off against each other, changing allegiance according to political advantage. In 1409, a council was convened at Pisa to resolve the issue. The Council of Pisa declared both existing popes to be schismatic (Gregory XII from Rome, Benedict XIII from Avignon) and appointed a new one, Alexander V. But the existing popes refused to resign and thus there were three papal claimants. Another council was convened in 1414, the Council of Constance. In March 1415 the Pisan pope, John XXIII, fled from Constance in disguise; he was brought back a prisoner and deposed in May. The Roman pope, Gregory XII, resigned voluntarily in July. The Avignon pope, Benedict XIII, refused to come to Constance; nor would he consider resignation. The council finally deposed him in July 1417. The council in Constance, having finally cleared the field of popes and antipopes, elected Pope Martin V as pope in November.  Criticsm of Church-corruption - John Wycliff and Jan Hus  Painting of Jan Hus in Council of Constance by V√°clav Bro≈æ√≠k. John Wycliffe (or Wyclif) (1330‚Äì1384) was an English scholar and alleged heretic best known for denouncing the corruptions of the Church, and his sponsoring the first translation of the Bible from Latin into English. He was a precursor of the Protestant Reformation. He emphasized the supremacy of the Bible, and called for a direct relationship between man and God, without interference by priests and bishops. His followers, called Lollards, faced persecution by the Church of England. They went underground for over a century and played a role in the English Reformation.G. R. Evans, John Wyclif: Myth & Reality (2006)Shannon McSheffrey, Lollards of Coventry, 1486‚Äì1522 (2003) Jan Hus (or Huss) (1369?‚Äì1415) a Czech theologian in Prague, was influenced by Wycliffe and spoke out against the corruptions he saw in the Church; his continued defiance led to his excommunication and condemnation by the Council of Constance, which also condemned John Wycliff. Hus was executed in 1415, but his followers arose in open rebellion. Between 1420 and 1431, the followers of Hus, known as Hussites, defeated five consecutive papal crusades. The wars ended in 1436 with the ratification of the compromise Compacts of Basel by the Church and the Hussites. Hus was a forerunner of the Protestant Reformation and his memory has become a powerful symbol of Czech culture in Bohemia.Thomas A. Fudge, Jan Hus: Religious Reform and Social Revolution in Bohemia (2010) Italian Renaissance Michelangelo's Piet√† in St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City The Renaissance was a period of great cultural change and achievement, marked in Italy by a classical orientation and an increase of wealth through mercantile trade. The city of Rome, the Papacy, and the Papal States were all affected by the Renaissance. On the one hand, it was a time of great artistic patronage and architectural magnificence, where the Church pardoned such artists as Michelangelo, Brunelleschi, Bramante, Raphael, Fra Angelico, Donatello, and Leonardo da Vinci. On the other hand, wealthy Italian families often secured episcopal offices, including the papacy, for their own members, some of whom were known for immorality, such as Alexander VI and Sixtus IV. In addition to being the head of the Church, the Pope became one of Italy's most important secular rulers, and pontiffs such as Julius II often waged campaigns to protect and expand their temporal domains. Furthermore, the popes, in a spirit of refined competition with other Italian lords, spent lavishly both on private luxuries but also on public works, repairing or building churches, bridges, and a magnificent system of aqueducts in Rome that still function today. It was during this time that St. Peter's Basilica, perhaps the most recognised Christian church, was built on the site of the old Constantinian basilica. It was also a time of increased contact with Greek culture, opening up new avenues of learning, especially in the fields of philosophy, poetry, classics, rhetoric, and political science, fostering a spirit of humanism‚Äîall of which would influence the Church. Fall of Constantinople (1453) In 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Empire. Under Ottoman rule, the Greek Orthodox Church acquired substantial power as an autonomous millet. The ecumenical patriarch was the religious and administrative ruler of the entire \\"Greek Orthodox nation\\" (Ottoman administrative unit), which encompassed all the Eastern Orthodox subjects of the Empire. As a result of the Ottoman conquest and the fall of Constantinople, the entire Orthodox communion of the Balkans and the Near East became suddenly isolated from the West. For the next four hundred years, it would be confined within a hostile Islamic world, with which it had little in common religiously or culturally. This is, in part, due to this geographical and intellectual confinement that the voice of Eastern Orthodoxy was not heard during the Reformation in sixteenth-century Europe. As a result, this important theological debate often seems strange and distorted to the Orthodox. They never took part in it and thus neither Reformation nor Counter- Reformation is part of their theological framework. =Religious rights under the Ottoman Empire= The new Ottoman government that arose from the ashes of Byzantine civilization was neither primitive nor barbaric. Islam not only recognized Jesus as a great prophet, but tolerated Christians as another People of the Book. As such, the Church was not extinguished nor was its canonical and hierarchical organisation significantly disrupted. Its administration continued to function. One of the first things that Mehmet the Conqueror did was to allow the Church to elect a new patriarch, Gennadius Scholarius. The Hagia Sophia and the Parthenon, which had been Christian churches for nearly a millennium were, admittedly, converted into mosques, yet countless other churches, both in Constantinople and elsewhere, remained in Christian hands. Moreover, it is striking that the patriarch's and the hierarchy's position was considerably strengthened and their power increased. They were endowed with civil as well as ecclesiastical power over all Christians in Ottoman territories. Because Islamic law makes no distinction between nationality and religion, all Christians, regardless of their language or nationality, were considered a single millet, or nation. The patriarch, as the highest ranking hierarch, was thus invested with civil and religious authority and made ethnarch, head of the entire Christian Orthodox population. Practically, this meant that all Orthodox Churches within Ottoman territory were under the control of Constantinople. Thus, the authority and jurisdictional frontiers of the patriarch were enormously enlarged. However, these rights and privileges (see Dhimmitude), including freedom of worship and religious organisation, were often established in principle but seldom corresponded to reality. The legal privileges of the patriarch and the Church depended, in fact, on the whim and mercy of the Sultan and the Sublime Porte, while all Christians were viewed as little more than second-class citizens. Moreover, Turkish corruption and brutality were not a myth. That it was the \\"infidel\\" Christian who experienced this more than anyone else is not in doubt. Nor were pogroms of Christians in these centuries unknown (see Greco- Turkish relations).The Australian Institute for Holocaust and Genocide Studies The New York Times.http://www.helleniccomserve.com/pdf/BlkBkPontusPrinceton.pdf Devastating, too, for the Church was the fact that it could not bear witness to Christ. Missionary work among Moslems was dangerous and indeed impossible, whereas conversion to Islam was entirely legal and permissible. Converts to Islam who returned to Orthodoxy were put to death as apostates. No new churches could be built and even the ringing of church bells was prohibited. Education of the clergy and the Christian population either ceased altogether or was reduced to the most rudimentary elements.

Their objective is to conserve the wildlife, habitat and natural resources of the Nilgiri Hills. NWEA conducts programs on environmental education, tree planting, bird watching, animal census, soil conservation and arrange trekking parties to Mukurthi National Park. NWEA has more than 500 members and is headquartered at Udagamandalam. District Collector of Nilgiris is the ex-officio president of the NWEA, and the Nilgiri North, Nilgiri South and Gudalur (DFOs) and the Field director of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and Mukurthi National Park are its official members. History The NWEA was founded in 1877 as the Nilgiri Game Association by a group of British planters and big-game hunters concerned with the alarming decline in game for hunting. It was the first wildlife conservation organisation in India. As a direct result of their actions in 1879, the Nilgiris Game and Fish Preservation Act was passed by the Government of Madras. This act empowered the association to regulate hunting and fishing in the Nilgiris. Thus all game was controlled by the Association, who imposed restrictions on the types of game to be hunted and the opening and closing of seasons for shikar. They issued game licenses to the British elite to serve their recreational needs. Local tribal groups were legally excluded from their traditional use of wild animals as food, however their snaring of small animals like monitor lizard and porcupine, fishing and scavenging the kills of predators continued. The Rules of the Nilgiri Game and Fish Preservation Association were amended in 1893, including that: # The name of the Association shall be The Nilgiri Game and Fish Preservation Association. # The objects of the Association are the preservation of the existing indigenous game and the introduction of game birds and animals and fish, either exotic or indigenous to India. The 1916 edition of the Nilgiri Guide and Directory published the complete details of the Institution, management, Shooting Limits, Residences, shooting Licenses, conditions, notes on rules, fishing rules, licenses, notes on rules, rewards for vermin, Hodgson's Hut, and the dak bungalows of the Nilgiri Game Association. Memorial for Richard Radcliffe The late Major Richard Radcliff, a famous hunter turned conservationist, led the association in creation of Mukurthi National Park. The NWEA has donated many of its former hunting bungalows to the Tamil Nadu Forest Department. NWEA is now helping the Forest Department to annex other Nilgiri Tahr habitats adjoining the park, which were excluded from the park boundaries when it was created. In 1975, with the adoption of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 by the Tamil Nadu Government, the organization changed its objective from controlled shooting to total wildlife conservation and environmental preservation. Rajiv Gandhi Wildlife Conservation Award for 2003 was given to the Nilgiri Wildlife and Environment Association (NWEA) in recognition of its outstanding efforts at preserving wildlife in its natural habitat and spreading ecological awareness. The award, consisted of Rs. 100,000, a medallion and a citation. It was handed over by J. C. Kala, Director General of Forests, in New Delhi Activities NWEA is an active participant in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve Alliance, a group of conservation and people's organisations that are concerned about the future of the NBR and are working collectively towards protecting it. NWEA conducts the annual Wildlife Census at Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and the adjoining Nilgiri North Forest Division. NWEA put together a report on the effects of the controversial Satyamangalam Railway line on this ecologically sensitive area. The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of the Supreme Court of India, after enquiry, found that the area is home to both elephants and tigers, and other species listed in Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. On the basis of this observation the CEC directed the Railways to withdraw the project. NWEA has facilitated the rehabilitation of ex-poachers by coordinating the Periyar Foundation (an ongoing eco development project under Project Tiger), the Literate Welfare Association, Kadamalai Gundu, Theni District and the Tamil Nadu Green Movement, Ooty, Nilgiri District. Ex- poachers and their wives have since been assisted in gaining new employment in the eco-tourism business. NWEA publicly recognizes and motivates government officials for significant contributions, dedication, involvement and personal interest in espousing the cause of environmental conservation.

Synopsis With the civil war on Romulus averted, Kirk is finally free to seek out the truth behind the death of his oldest and closest friend. Was Spock killed by the shadowy organisation known as the Totality? A generous offer from Starfleet provides him with the starship he needs in order to reach his goal. Their only proviso: that they can call on his help if they need him. But what happened to Spock is not Kirk's only worry: Joseph, his son, is rebelling wildly against the restrictions placed on him as the price of Romulan peace. Is the Totality somehow also linked to Joseph's rage? But before he can find the answers to either troubling question, Kirk receives a call from Admiral Janeway, telling him she needs him to save the Federation. Torn between his mission and his duty, the cause of the Federation must claim him one more time before he can turn his attention either to his friend or to his son.

History Guam Memorial Hospital Authority was created prior to 1954 to administer and operate the Guam Memorial Hospital.Guam Memorial Hospital Authority Its operations represent a major change in the history of the government's role in delivery of medical care to the community. Historically, the U.S. government provided free hospital and health care services to the people of Guam. The U.S. Naval forces assumed responsibility for the island's medical needs at the turn of the 20th century when the United States took formal possession of Guam. These services continued with the U.S. Navy's delivery of care after World War II, and culminated with their donation of the first hospital facility of the Government of Guam's Department of Public Health and Welfare in the postwar era. This \\"Quonset Hut\\" facility was replaced in 1956 with the construction of the Guam Memorial Hospital at Oka Point which originally served as a nurse training facility and tuberculosis hospital.Guampedia, \\"U.S. Naval Era: Hospitals\\" As the need for hospital services increased, this Oka Point facility was renovated to serve as a 230-bed hospital that offered acute, psychiatric and long-term care services. In 1964, the Guam Memorial Hospital was established as a line agency of the Government of Guam's executive branch. Its creation separated hospital services from community health services provided by the Department of Public Health and Welfare Corporation. Thirteen years later in 1977, the Guam Memorial Hospital was created as a Public Corporation, and has since been operating as a \\"governmental, non-profit institution serving the people of Guam, \\" under the governance of a Board of Trustees. Prior to August 19, 1983, Guam Memorial Hospital provided mental health services.

S. Hutton, The Times, 7 August 1970 (pg. 8; Issue 57938; col E) Early life Robert Salmon Hutton was the son of J.B Hutton, a member of an old, well-known firm of silver table-ware manufacturers in Sheffield. Hutton spent his early life in London apart from the time he was at Blundell's School in Tiverton. From school he went to Owens College in Manchester, followed by two years at the University of Leipzig and one in Paris. Career Hutton was appointed lecturer in electro-metallurgy at Manchester University in 1900, but in 1908 moved to Sheffield where he entered the family business. In 1921 he was invited to become director of the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research Association. The Association expanded and achieved a world-wide reputation under his guidance. He was one of the original members of the Institute of Metals and a member of Council from 1909 to 1935. Hutton became the first Goldsmiths‚Äô Professor in Metallurgy at Cambridge University in 1931. Although some of the pioneer work in metallography had been carried out by Heycock and Neville in the University Chemical Laboratory and formed part of the course in assaying chemistry, metallurgy was not included as a separate subject in the Natural Sciences Tripos. The Goldsmiths‚Äô Company had generously provided funds for a small laboratory and endowed a chair, but it was Hutton who first persuaded the university to introduce metallurgy into Part II of the Natural Sciences Tripos and later Part I. Hutton was elected a Fellow of Clare College and became a member of the Court of the Goldsmiths‚Äô Company in 1936. Hutton‚Äôs activities were not confined to those directly concerned with his various appointments. He had two absorbing interests: technical education and libraries. His experience in the field of metallurgy led him to the conclusion that there was a sad delay between scientific advance and its application in industry, for which he blamed technical education, or rather lack of it. His practical interest was shown in the work which he did for the City and Guilds of London Institute of which he was Chairman of Council from 1939 to 1948. He was largely instrumental in starting the Association of Special Libraries and was its president from 1942 to 1944. In 1912 Hutton married Sibyl, daughter of Sir Arthur Schuster, F.R.S., by whom be had a son and a daughter.  Society for the Protection of Science and Learning  Hutton was on the committee of the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning from the date of its move to Cambridge at the outbreak of World War II and for 30 years never missed a meeting. For many years he was the honorary secretary and later honorary treasurer and was responsible for most of the work involved when the Society became a registered charity in 1959. From 1933 Hutton went to Germany several times to negotiate the release of scientists and scholars from Nazi persecution and he served on the Society‚Äôs allocation committee from 1939. Incidentally, one of the founders of the Society, A. V. Hill, was a fellow Old Blundellian. Research and publications Hutton published work in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, Transactions of the Faraday Society, and the Institute of Metals, contributing the Autumn Lecture to the Institute of Metals in 1922, on the \\"Science of Human Effort\\". Hutton took part in discussions on a number of papers of general metallurgical interest, and was an authority on refractories and furnace construction. He was one of those responsible for starting Research, a journal devoted to making scientific advance known to a wider public and to bridging the gap between pure science and its application to industry. He was secretary to the scientific advisory board of the journal. References Sources * Letter from Professor W.

The history of modern Christianity concerns the Christian religion from the beginning of the 15th century to the end of World War II. It can be divided in the early modern period and the late modern period. The history of Christianity in the early modern period coincides with the Age of Exploration, and is usually taken to begin with the Protestant Reformation (usually rounded down to 1500) and ending in the late 18th century with the onset of the Industrial Revolution and the events leading up to the French Revolution of 1789. It includes the Protestant Reformation, the Counter-Reformation and the Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery. Christianity expanded throughout the world during the Age of Exploration. Christianity has thus become the world's largest religion.Adherents.com, Religions by Adherents Early modern period (c.1500 - c.1750) Orthodoxy under Ottoman rule In 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Empire. Under Ottoman rule, the Greek Orthodox Church acquired substantial power as an autonomous millet. The ecumenical patriarch was the religious and administrative ruler of the entire \\"Greek Orthodox nation\\" (Ottoman administrative unit), which encompassed all the Eastern Orthodox subjects of the Empire. As a result of the Ottoman conquest and the fall of Constantinople, the entire Orthodox communion of the Balkans and the Near East became suddenly isolated from the West. For the next four hundred years, it would be confined within a hostile Islamic world, with which it had little in common religiously or culturally. This is, in part, due to this geographical and intellectual confinement that the voice of Eastern Orthodoxy was not heard during the Reformation in sixteenth-century Europe. As a result, this important theological debate often seems strange and distorted to the Orthodox. They never took part in it and thus neither Reformation nor Counter- Reformation is part of their theological framework. The new Ottoman government that arose from the ashes of Byzantine civilisation was neither primitive nor barbaric. Islam not only recognised Jesus as a great prophet, but tolerated Christians as another People of the Book. As such, the Church was not extinguished nor was its canonical and hierarchical organisation significantly disrupted. Its administration continued to function. One of the first things that Mehmet the Conqueror did was to allow the Church to elect a new patriarch, Gennadius Scholarius. The Hagia Sophia and the Parthenon, which had been Christian churches for nearly a millennium were, admittedly, converted into mosques, yet countless other churches, both in Constantinople and elsewhere, remained in Christian hands. Moreover, it is striking that the patriarch's and the hierarchy's position was considerably strengthened and their power increased. They were endowed with civil as well as ecclesiastical power over all Christians in Ottoman territories. Because Islamic law makes no distinction between nationality and religion, all Christians, regardless of their language or nationality, were considered a single millet, or nation. The patriarch, as the highest ranking hierarch, was thus invested with civil and religious authority and made ethnarch, head of the entire Christian Orthodox population. Practically, this meant that all Orthodox Churches within Ottoman territory were under the control of Constantinople. Thus, the authority and jurisdictional frontiers of the patriarch were enormously enlarged. However, these rights and privileges (see Dhimmitude), including freedom of worship and religious organisation, were often established in principle but seldom corresponded to reality. The legal privileges of the patriarch and the Church depended, in fact, on the whim and mercy of the Sultan and the Sublime Porte, while all Christians were viewed as little more than second-class citizens. Moreover, Turkish corruption and brutality were not a myth. That it was the \\"infidel\\" Christian who experienced this more than anyone else is not in doubt. Nor were pogroms of Christians in these centuries unknown (see Greco- Turkish relations).The Australian Institute for Holocaust and Genocide Studies The New York Times.http://www.helleniccomserve.com/pdf/BlkBkPontusPrinceton.pdf Devastating, too, for the Church was the fact that it could not bear witness to Christ. Missionary work among Moslems was dangerous and indeed impossible, whereas conversion to Islam was entirely legal and permissible. Converts to Islam who returned to Orthodoxy were put to death as apostates. No new churches could be built and even the ringing of church bells was prohibited. Education of the clergy and the Christian population either ceased altogether or was reduced to the most rudimentary elements. =Corruption= The Orthodox Church found itself subject to the Turkish system of corruption. The patriarchal throne was frequently sold to the highest bidder, while new patriarchal investiture was accompanied by heavy payment to the government. In order to recoup their losses, patriarchs and bishops taxed the local parishes and their clergy. Nor was the patriarchal throne ever secure. Few patriarchs between the fifteenth and the nineteenth centuries died a natural death while in office. The forced abdications, exiles, hangings, drownings, and poisonings of patriarchs are well documented. But if the patriarch's position was precarious so was the hierarchy's. The hanging of patriarch Gregory V from the gate of the patriarchate on Easter Sunday 1821 was accompanied by the execution of two metropolitans and twelve bishops. =Devshirmeh= Devshirmeh was the system of the collection of young boys from conquered Christian lands by the Ottoman sultans as a form of regular taxation in order to build a loyal army (formerly largely composed of war captives) and the class of (military) administrators called the \\"Janissaries\\", or other servants such as tellak in hamams. The word dev≈üirme means \\"collecting, gathering\\" in Ottoman Turkish. Boys delivered to the Ottomans in this way were called ghilm√°n or acemi oglanlar (\\"novice boys\\"). The Reformation (1520‚Äì1641) Age of Enlightenment (1640‚Äì1740) Maps of territory held by Royalists (red) and Parliamentarians (green), 1642‚Äì1645 The Enlightenment constituted a new challenge of the Church. Unlike the Protestant Reformation, which questioned certain Christian doctrines, the Enlightenment questioned Christianity as a whole. Generally, it elevated human reason above divine revelation and down-graded religious authorities such as the papacy based on itLortz, IV, 7-11 =Puritan movement= The Counter-Reformation on the Continent and the growth of a Puritan party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarized the Elizabethan Age, although it was not until the 1640s that England underwent religious strife comparable to that which its neighbours had suffered some generations before. The early Puritan movement (late 16th century-17th century) was Reformed or Calvinist and was a movement for reform in the Church of England. Its origins lay in the discontent with the Elizabethan Religious Settlement. The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe, especially Geneva. The Puritans objected to ornaments and ritual in the churches as idolatrous (vestments, surplices, organs, genuflection), which they castigated as \\"popish pomp and rags\\". (See Vestments controversy.) They also objected to ecclesiastical courts. They refused to endorse completely all of the ritual directions and formulas of the Book of Common Prayer; the imposition of its liturgical order by legal force and inspection sharpened Puritanism into a definite opposition movement. The later Puritan movement were often referred to as Dissenters and Nonconformists and eventually led to the formation of various Reformed denominations. The most famous and well-known emigration to America was the migration of the Puritans, or pilgrims, left England so that they could live in an area with Puritanism established as the exclusive civic religion. Though they had left England because of the suppression of their religious practice, most Puritans had thereafter originally settled in the Low Countries but found the licentiousness there, where the state hesitated from enforcing religious practice, as unacceptable, so with hopes of a Puritan utopia, they set out to establish the English colonies of New England, which later became the United States. These Puritan separatists were also known as \\"the pilgrims\\". After establishing a colony at Plymouth (in what would become later Massachusetts) in 1620, the Puritan pilgrims received a charter from the King of England which legitimized their colony, allowing them to do trade and commerce with merchants in England, in accordance with the principles of mercantilism. This successful, though initially quite difficult, colony marked the beginning of the Protestant presence in America (the earlier French, Spanish and Portuguese settlements had been Catholic), and became a kind of oasis of spiritual and economic freedom, to which persecuted Protestants and other minorities from the British Isles and Europe (and later, from all over the world) fled to for peace, freedom and opportunity. The original intent of the colonists was to establish spiritual Puritanism, which had been denied to them in England and the rest of Europe to engage in peaceful commerce with England and the Native American Indians and to Christianize the peoples of the Americas. The most famous colonisation by Protestants in the New World was that of English Puritans in North America. Unlike the Spanish or French, the English colonists made surprisingly little effort to evangelise the native peoples.MacCulloch, Diarmaid, The Reformation: A History (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 540 =Roman Catholic missions= The Roman Catholic Church established a number of Missions to convert the indigenous peoples. At the same time, missionaries such those from Jesuits, Augustinians, Franciscans and Dominicans were moving into Asia and the Far East. The Portuguese sent missions into Africa. Matteo Ricci's Jesuit mission to China was relatively peaceful and focused on adopted the Catholic faith to Chinese thinking, permitting among others the veneration of the dead. The Vatican disagreed and forbade any adaptation in the so-called Chinese Rites controversy in 1692 and 1742. The expansion of the Catholic Portuguese Empire and Spanish Empire with a significant roled played by the Roman Catholic Church led to the Christianization of the indigenous populations of the Americas such as the Aztecs and Incas, but, until the 19th century, missions had to work under the Spanish and Portuguese governments and military.Franzen, 362 Late modern period (c.1750 - c.1945) Revivalism (1720‚Äì1906) Revivalism refers to the Calvinist and Wesleyan revival, called the Great Awakening, in North America which saw the development of evangelical Congregationalist, Presbyterian, Baptist, and new Methodist churches. When the movement eventually waned, it gave rise to new Restorationist movements. =Great Awakenings (18th-19th century)= The First Great Awakening was a wave of religious enthusiasm among Protestants in the American colonies c. 1730‚Äì1740, emphasising the traditional Reformed virtues of Godly preaching, rudimentary liturgy, and a deep sense of personal guilt and redemption by Christ Jesus. Historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom saw it as part of a \\"great international Protestant upheaval\\" that also created Pietism in Germany, the Evangelical Revival, and Methodism in England.Sydney E. Ahlstrom, A Religious History of the American People. (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1972) p. 263 It centred on reviving the spirituality of established congregations, and mostly affected Congregational, Presbyterian, Dutch Reformed, German Reformed, Baptist, and Methodist churches, while also spreading within the slave population. The Second Great Awakening (1800-1830s), unlike the first, focused on the unchurched and sought to instil in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings. It also sparked the beginnings of the Restoration Movement, the Latter Day Saint movement, Adventism and the Holiness movement. The Third Great Awakening began from 1857 and was most notable for taking the movement throughout the world, especially in English speaking countries. The final group to emerge from the \\"great awakenings\\" in North America was Pentecostalism, which had its roots in the Methodist, Wesleyan, and Holiness movements, and began in 1906 on Azusa Street, in Los Angeles. Pentecostalism would later lead to the Charismatic movement. =French Revolution and worship of Reason= Matters grew still worse with the violent anti-clericalism of the French Revolution.Edward, The Cambridge Modern History (1908), p. 25 Direct attacks on the wealth of the Catholic Church and associated grievances led to the wholesale nationalisation of church property and attempts to establish a state-run church. Large numbers of priests refused to take an oath of compliance to the National Assembly, leading to the Catholic Church being outlawed and replaced by a new religion of the worship of \\"Reason\\" along with a new French Republican Calendar. In this period, all monasteries were destroyed, 30,000 priests were exiled and hundreds more were killed.Bokenkotter, A Concise History of the Catholic Church (2004), pp. 283-5 When Pope Pius VI sided against the revolution in the First Coalition, Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Italy. The 82-year-old pope was taken as a prisoner to France in February 1799 and died in Valence August 29, 1799 after six months of captivity. To win popular support for his rule, Napoleon re-established the Catholic Church in France through the Concordat of 1801.Collins, The Story of Christianity (1999), p. 176 All over Europe, the end of the Napoleonic wars signaled by the Congress of Vienna, brought Catholic revival, renewed enthusiasm, and new respect for the papacy following the depredations of the previous era.Duffy, Saints and Sinners (1997), pp. 214-6 =Restorationism= Restorationism refers to various unaffiliated movements that considered contemporary Christianity, in all its forms, to be a deviation from the true, original Christianity, which these groups then attempted to \\"Reconstruct\\", often using the Book of Acts as a \\"guidebook\\" of sorts. Restorationism developed out of the Second Great Awakening and is historically connected to the Protestant Reformation,Ahlstrom's summary is as follows: Restorationism has its genesis with Thomas and Alexander Campbell, whose movement is connected to the German Reformed Church through Otterbein, Albright, and Winebrenner (p. 212). American Millennialism and Adventism, which arose from Evangelical Protestantism, produced certain groups such as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (p. 387, 501‚Äì9), the Jehovah's Witness movement (p. 807), and, as a reaction specifically to William Miller, Seventh Day Adventism (p. 381); Sydney E. Ahlstrom, A Religious History of the American People. (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1972) but differs in that Restorationists do not usually describe themselves as \\"reforming\\" a Christian church continuously existing from the time of Jesus, but as restoring the Church that they believe was lost at some point. The name Restoration is also used to describe the Latter-day Saints (Mormons) and the Jehovah's Witness Movement. Latter Day Saints Cover page of The Book of Mormon from an original 1830 edition, by Joseph Smith, Jr..Image from the U.S. Library of Congress Rare Book and Special Collections Division The driving force behind and founder of the Latter Day Saint movement was Joseph Smith, Jr., and to a lesser extent, during the movement's first two years, Oliver Cowdery. Throughout his life, Smith told of an experience he had as a boy having seen God the Father and Jesus Christ as two separate beings, who told him that the true church had been lost and would be restored through him, and that he would be given the authority to organize and lead the true Church of Christ. Smith and Cowdery also explained that the angels John the Baptist, Peter, James and John visited them in 1829 and gave them authority to reestablish the Church of Christ and in 1838 Joseph Smith announced that he had received a revelation from God officially expanding the common name to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.Manuscript History of the Church, LDS Church Archives, book A-1, p. 37; reproduced in Dean C. Jessee (comp.) (1989). The Papers of Joseph Smith: Autobiographical and Historical Writings (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) 1:302‚Äì303.H. Michael Marquardt and Wesley P. Walters (1994). Inventing Mormonism: Tradition and the Historical Record (Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books) p. 160. Smith first published the Book of Mormon in March 1830, which LDS members believe was translated from Golden Plates buried in the ground, and contains a record of Americas between about 600 BC and 400 AD and an original church of Jesus therein. In 1844, William Law and several other Latter Day Saints in church leadership positions publicly denounced Smith's secret practice of polygamy in the controversial Nauvoo Expositor, and formed their own church. The city council of Nauvoo, Illinois subsequently had the printing press of the Expositor destroyed. In spite of Smith's later offer to pay damages for destroyed property, critics of Smith and the church considered the destruction heavy-handed. Some called for the Latter Day Saints to be either expelled or destroyed. Following Smith's assassination by a mob in Carthage, Illinois, some prominent members of the church claimed to be Smith's legitimate successor. These various claims resulted in a succession crisis, in which the majority of church members followed Brigham Young, he being the senior Apostle of the church; others followed Sidney Rigdon or James Strang. The crisis resulted in several permanent schisms as well as the formation of occasional splinter groups, some of which no longer exist. These various groups are occasionally referred to under two geographical headings: \\"Prairie Saints\\" (those that remained in the Midwest United States) and \\"Rocky Mountain Saints\\" (those who followed Brigham Young to what would later become the state of Utah). Today, there are many schism organizations who regard themselves as a part of the Latter Day Saint movement, though in most cases they do not acknowledge the other branches as valid and regard their own tradition as the only correct and authorized version of the church Smith founded. The vast majority of Latter Day Saints belong to the largest denomination, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) which claims 13 million members worldwide. The second- largest denomination is the Community of Christ, which reports over 250,000 members. Russian Orthodoxy Orthodoxy was very strong in Russia, which had recently acquired an autocephalous status, and as the only part of the Orthodox communion which remained outside the control of the Ottoman Empire; Moscow called itself the Third Rome, as the heir of Constantinople. In 1721 Tsar Peter I abolished completely the patriarchate and so the Russian Orthodox Church effectively became a department of the government, ruled by a Most Holy Synod composed of senior bishops and lay bureaucrats appointed by the Tsar himself. This continued until the 20th century. =Russian Orthodox Church in the Russian Empire= Churches of the Moscow Kremlin, as seen from the Balchug The Russian Orthodox Church held a privileged position in the Russian Empire, expressed in the motto, Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Populism, of the late Russian Empire. At the same time, it was placed under the control of the Tsar by the Church reform of Peter I in the 18th century. Its governing body was Most Holy Synod, which was run by an official (titled Ober-Procurator) appointed by the Tsar himself. The church was involved in the various campaigns of russification,Natalia Shlikhta (2004) \\"'Greek Catholic'-'Orthodox'-'Soviet': a symbiosis or a conflict of identities?\\" in Religion, State & Society, Volume 32, Number 3 (Routledge) and accused of the involvement in anti-Jewish pogroms.Shlomo Lambroza, John D. Klier (2003) Pogroms: Anti-Jewish Violence in Modern Russian History (Cambridge University Press) In the case of anti-Semitism and the anti-Jewish pogroms, no evidence is given of the direct participation of the church, and many Russian Orthodox clerics, including senior hierarchs, openly defended persecuted Jews, at least from the second half of the nineteenth century.\\"Jewish-Christian Relations\\" , by the International Council of Christians and Jews Also, the Church has no official position on Judaism as such.It is no coincidence that in the entry on 'Orthodoxy' in the seventh volume of the Kratkaya Evreiskaya Entsyklopedia, devoted to the Russian Orthodox Church (pp. 733‚Äì743), where numerous examples are given of persecution of the Jews in Russia, including religious persecution, no evidence is given of the direct participation of the church, either in legislative terms or in the conduct of policy. Although the authors of the article state that the active role of the Church in inciting the government to conduct anti-Jewish acts (for example in the case of Ivan the Terrible's policy in the defeated territories) is 'obvious', no facts are given in their article to support this. http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?id=787 The Church was allowed to impose taxes on the peasants. The Church, like the Tsarist state was seen as an enemy of the people by the Bolsheviks and other Russian revolutionaries. =Russian Orthodox Church in the Soviet Union= The Russian Orthodox Church collaborated with the White Army in the Russian Civil War (see White movement) after the October Revolution. This may have further strengthened the Bolshevik animus against the church. After the October Revolution of 7 November 1917 (October 25 Old Calendar) there was a movement within the Soviet Union to unite all of the people of the world under Communist rule (see Communist International). This included the Eastern European bloc countries as well as the Balkan States. Since some of these Slavic states tied their ethnic heritage to their ethnic churches, both the peoples and their church where targeted by the Soviet.President of Lithuania: Prisoner of the Gulag a Biography of Aleksandras Stulginskis by Afonsas Eidintas Genocide and Research Centre of Lithuania / 9789986757412 / 9986‚Äì757‚Äì41-X pg 23 \\"As early as August 1920 Lenin wrote to E.

Criticism of atheism was strictly forbidden and sometimes lead to imprisonment.Sermons to young people by Father George Calciu- Dumitreasa. Given at the Chapel of the Romanian Orthodox Church Seminary, The Word online. Bucharest http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/resources/sermons/calciu_christ_calling.htm The Soviet Union was the first state to have as an ideological objective the elimination of religion. Toward that end, the Communist regime confiscated church property, ridiculed religion, harassed believers, and propagated atheism in the schools. Actions toward particular religions, however, were determined by State interests, and most organised religions were never outlawed. Some actions against Orthodox priests and believers along with execution included torture being sent to prison camps, labour camps or mental hospitals.Father Arseny 1893‚Äì1973 Priest, Prisoner, Spiritual Father.

St Vladimir's Seminary Press The Washington Post Anti-Communist Priest Gheorghe Calciu-Dumitreasa By Patricia Sullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Sunday, 2006-11-26; Page C09 https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2006/11/25/AR2006112500783.html The result of this state atheism was to transform the Church into a persecuted and martyred Church. In the first five years after the Bolshevik revolution, 28 bishops and 1,200 priests were executed.Ostling, Richard. \\"Cross meets Kremlin\\" TIME Magazine, 2001-06-24. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,150718,00.html This included people like the Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna who was at this point a monastic. Along with her murder was Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich Romanov; the Princes Ioann Konstantinovich, Konstantin Konstantinovich, Igor Konstantinovich and Vladimir Pavlovich Paley; Grand Duke Sergei's secretary, Fyodor Remez; and Varvara Yakovleva, a sister from the Grand Duchess Elizabeth's convent. They were herded into the forest, pushed into an abandoned mineshaft and grenades were then hurled into the mineshaft. Her remains were buried in Jerusalem, in the Church of Maria Magdalene. Christ the Saviour Cathedral Moscow after reconstruction The main target of the anti-religious campaign in the 1920s and 1930s was the Russian Orthodox Church, which had the largest number of faithful. Nearly its entire clergy, and many of its believers, were shot or sent to labor camps. Theological schools were closed, and church publications were prohibited. In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to less than 500. Between 1917 and 1940, 130,000 Orthodox priests were arrested. Of these, 95,000 were put to death, executed by firing squad. Father Pavel Florensky was one of the New-martyrs of this particular period. After Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church to intensify patriotic support for the war effort. By 1957 about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become active. But in 1959 Nikita Khrushchev initiated his own campaign against the Russian Orthodox Church and forced the closure of about 12,000 churches. By 1985 fewer than 7,000 churches remained active.Ostling, Richard. \\"Cross meets Kremlin\\" TIME Magazine, 2001-06-24. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,150718,00.html Members of the church hierarchy were jailed or forced out, their places taken by docile clergy, many of whom had ties with the KGB. In the Soviet Union, in addition to the methodical closing and destruction of churches, the charitable and social work formerly done by ecclesiastical authorities was taken over by the state. As with all private property, Church owned property was confiscated into public use. The few places of worship left to the Church were legally viewed as state property which the government permitted the church to use. After the advent of state funded universal education, the Church was not permitted to carry on educational, instructional activity for children. For adults, only training for church-related occupations was allowed. Outside of sermons during the celebration of the divine liturgy it could not instruct or evangelise to the faithful or its youth. Catechism classes, religious schools, study groups, Sunday schools and religious publications were all illegal and or banned. This persecution continued, even after the death of Stalin until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. This caused many religious tracts to be circulated as illegal literature or samizdat. Since the fall of the Soviet Union there have been many New-martyrs added as Saints from the yoke of atheism. =Diaspora emigration to the West= One of the most striking developments in modern historical Orthodoxy is the dispersion of Orthodox Christians to the West. Emigration from Greece and the Near East in the last hundred years has created a sizable Orthodox diaspora in Western Europe, North and South America, and Australia. In addition, the Bolshevik Revolution forced thousands of Russian exiles westward. As a result, Orthodoxy's traditional frontiers have been profoundly modified. Millions of Orthodox are no longer geographically \\"eastern\\" since they live permanently in their newly adopted countries in the West. Nonetheless, they remain Eastern Orthodox in their faith and practice. Western Christianity in the 20th century =Fascism= Fascism describes certain related political regimes in 20th- century Europe, especially the Nazi Germany of Hitler, the Fascist Italy of Mussolini and the falangist Spain of Franco. About Italian Fascism Pope Pius XI is said to have been moderately sceptic and G. K. Chesterton friendly but critical. In the Spanish Civil War Roman Catholics internationally were mainly in support of either neutral or on Franco's side, due to Aza√±a's de facto toleration of anti-clerical violence in and just before this conflict. Dollfuss in Austria was the ideal politician realising Pope Pius XI's Quadragesimo anno. =Nazism= The position of Christians in Nazi Fascism is highly complex. Regarding the matter, historian Derek Holmes wrote, \\"There is no doubt that the Catholic districts, resisted the lure of National Socialism [Nazism] far better than the Protestant ones.\\"Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 102. Pope Pius XI declared - Mit brennender Sorge - that Fascist governments had hidden \\"pagan intentions\\" and expressed the irreconcilability of the Catholic position and Totalitarian Fascist State Worship, which placed the nation above God and fundamental human rights and dignity. His declaration that \\"Spiritually, [Christians] are all Semites\\" prompted the Nazis to give him the title \\"Chief Rabbi of the Christian World.\\"Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 116. Catholic priests were executed in concentration camps alongside Jews; for example, 2,600 Catholic Priests were imprisoned in Dachau, and 2,000 of them were executed. A further 2,700 Polish priests were executed (a quarter of all Polish priests), and 5,350 Polish nuns were either displaced, imprisoned, or executed.John Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History (New York: Paulist Press, 2005), p. 332 & n. 37. Many Catholic laypeople and clergy played notable roles in sheltering Jews during the Holocaust, including Pope Pius XII (1876‚Äì1958). The head rabbi of Rome became a Catholic in 1945 and, in honour of the actions the Pope undertook to save Jewish lives, he took the name Eugenio (the pope's first name).John Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History (New York: Paulist Press, 2005), p. 332. A former Israeli consul in Italy claimed: \\"The Catholic Church saved more Jewish lives during the war than all the other churches, religious institutions, and rescue organisations put together.\\"Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 158. In Austria there was strong Catholic resistance to National Socialism. The outstanding resistance group is that around the priest Heinrich Maier. This Catholic resistance group very successfully passed on plans and production sites for V-2 rockets, Tiger tanks and aircraft to the Allies. From the fall of 1943 at least, these transmissions informed the Allies about the exact site plans of German production plants. With the location sketches of the manufacturing facilities, the Allied bombers were given precise air strikes. In contrast to many other German resistance groups, the Maier Group informed very early about the mass murder of Jews through their contacts with the Semperit factory near Auschwitz. In total, as Austrian resistance fighters, 706 priests were imprisoned in the Nazi regime, 128 in concentration camps and 20 to 90 executed or murdered in the concentration camp. In 1940 the SS designated Dachau concentration camp with its own priest block as a central internment place for Christian clergymen who were often severely tortured. In addition, there were always special riots against the priests.Elisabeth Boeckl-Klamper, Thomas Mang, Wolfgang Neugebauer: Gestapo-Leitstelle Wien 1938‚Äì1945. Vienna 2018, .Hans Schafranek: Widerstand und Verrat: Gestapospitzel im antifaschistischen Untergrund. Vienna 2017, .Erika Weinzierl: Kirchlicher Widerstand gegen den Nationalsozialismus. In: Themen der Zeitgeschichte und der Gegenwart. Vienna 2004, , p 76‚Äì85.Jean Bernhard: Pfarrerblock 25487. Dachau 1941-42. (2004) p 44; Walter Ferber: 55 Monate Dachau: Ein Tatsachenbericht. (1993). The relationship between Nazism and Protestantism, especially the German Lutheran Church, was complex. Though the majority of Protestant church leaders in Germany supported the Nazis' growing anti-Jewish activities, some, such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer (a Lutheran pastor) were strongly opposed to the Nazis. Bonhoeffer was later found guilty in the conspiracy to assassinate Hitler and executed. =Ecumenism= Ecumenism broadly refers to movements between Christian groups to establish a degree of unity through dialogue. \\"Ecumenism\\" is derived from Greek (oikoumene), which means \\"the inhabited world\\", but more figuratively something like \\"universal oneness.\\" The movement can be distinguished into Catholic and Protestant movements, with the latter characterised by a redefined ecclesiology of \\"denominationalism\\" (which the Catholic Church, among others, rejects). Catholic ecumenism Over the last century, a number of moves have been made to reconcile the schism between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches. Although progress has been made, concerns over papal primacy and the independence of the smaller Orthodox churches has blocked a final resolution of the schism. On 30 November 1895, Pope Leo XIII published the Apostolic Letter Orientalium Dignitas (On the Churches of the East) safeguarding the importance and continuance of the Eastern traditions for the whole Church. On 7 December 1965, a Joint Catholic-Orthodox Declaration of Pope Paul VI and the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I was issued lifting the mutual excommunications of 1054. Some of the most difficult questions in relations with the ancient Eastern Churches concern some doctrine (i.e. Filioque, Scholasticism, functional purposes of asceticism, the essence of God, Hesychasm, Fourth Crusade, establishment of the Latin Empire, Uniatism to note but a few) as well as practical matters such as the concrete exercise of the claim to papal primacy and how to ensure that ecclesiastical union would not mean mere absorption of the smaller Churches by the Latin component of the much larger Catholic Church (the most numerous single religious denomination in the world), and the stifling or abandonment of their own rich theological, liturgical and cultural heritage. With respect to Catholic relations with Protestant communities, certain commissions were established to foster dialogue and documents have been produced aimed at identifying points of doctrinal unity, such as the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification produced with the Lutheran World Federation in 1999. Ecumenism within Protestantism Ecumenical movements within Protestantism have focused on determining a list of doctrines and practices essential to being Christian and thus extending to all groups which fulfil these basic criteria a (more or less) co-equal status, with perhaps one's own group still retaining a \\"first among equal\\" standing. This process involved a redefinition of the idea of \\"the Church\\" from traditional theology. This ecclesiology, known as denominationalism, contends that each group (which fulfils the essential criteria of \\"being Christian\\") is a sub-group of a greater \\"Christian Church\\", itself a purely abstract concept with no direct representation, i.e., no group, or \\"denomination\\", claims to be \\"the Church.\\" Obviously, this ecclesiology is at variance with other groups that indeed consider themselves to be \\"the Church.\\" The \\"essential criteria\\" generally consist of belief in the Trinity, belief that Jesus Christ is the only way to have forgiveness and eternal life, and that He died and rose again bodily. Trends in western theology =Modernism and liberal Christianity= Liberal Christianity, sometimes called liberal theology, is an umbrella term covering diverse, philosophically-informed religious movements and moods within late 18th-, 19th- and 20th-century Christianity. The word \\"liberal\\" in liberal Christianity does not refer to a leftist political agenda or set of beliefs, but rather to the freedom of dialectic process associated with continental philosophy and other philosophical and religious paradigms developed during the Age of Enlightenment. =Fundamentalism= Fundamentalist Christianity, is a movement that arose mainly within British and American Protestantism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in reaction to modernism and certain liberal Protestant groups that denied doctrines considered fundamental to Christianity yet still called themselves \\"Christian.\\" Thus, fundamentalism sought to re-establish tenets that could not be denied without relinquishing a Christian identity, the \\"fundamentals\\": inerrancy of the Bible, Sola Scriptura, the Virgin Birth of Jesus, the doctrine of substitutionary atonement, the bodily Resurrection of Jesus, and the imminent return of Jesus Christ. Contemporary Christianity (1945 - present) Second Vatican Council On 11 October 1962 Pope John XXIII opened the Second Vatican Council, the 21st ecumenical council of the Catholic Church. The council was \\"pastoral\\" in nature, emphasising and clarifying already defined dogma, revising liturgical practices, and providing guidance for articulating traditional Church teachings in contemporary times. The council is perhaps best known for its instructions that the Mass may be celebrated in the vernacular as well as in Latin See also *History of Christian theology *History of the Roman Catholic Church *History of the Eastern Orthodox Church *History of Protestantism *Christianization *Timeline of Christianity *Roman Catholic Church *Eastern Orthodox Church *Protestantism *Timeline of Christian missions Notes Resources  External links The following links give an overview of the history of Christianity: *History of Christianity Reading Room: Extensive online resources for the study of global church history (Tyndale Seminary). *Dictionary of the History of Ideas: Christianity in History *Dictionary of the History of Ideas: Church as an Institution *Sketches of Church History From AD 33 to the Reformation by Rev.

Early life Ayi Jihu grew up in Leibo County in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan. Dance was one of her early hobbies. Her parents were farmers; however, her father died when she was just five or six, leaving Ayi to help her mother with farm chores, mainly raising ducks and chickens. She was exposed to traditional Yi ethnic music and dance from an early age, and found inspiration in the example of Qubi Awu, also an ethnic Yi from Sichuan, whose talents earned her a performance on China Central Television. In 1994, Jihu's aunt brought her over to London. Her mother, who goes by the English name Cindy, also moved to the UK and remarried to a man named Samuel. She studied in The Leys School for Year 9 in the academic year of 1998-1999 in North B House. In her new country, she came into contact with a variety of musical styles in concerts and clubs she attended with her friends; R&B; especially piqued her interest. Though living in the UK, she continued to observe a number of Yi traditions at home, including the Torch Festival. Career Ayi Jihu was signed to Shlepp Records in 2007, with whom she released her first album, Try Me. She performed at Macau's Sands Casino in February of that year. In September 2008, she performed at the London Week of Peace concert in Trafalgar Square, singing an R&B; song entitled \\"Winner\\". In September 2010, the BBC released an article describing Ayi Jihu's rise to stardom, dubbing her the \\"Chinese Madonna\\" and claiming that she had been awarded a gold disc to commemorate 100 million downloads of her album by fans in China. However, a Xinhua News Agency report expressed suspicion of her claims, noting that she did not specify what organisation awarded her the alleged golden disc, and furthermore that the website of her label Shlepp Records did not list any singers under their management besides Ayi Jihu herself. In April 2011, she was in the \\"Fear Chaser\\" Event on AdventureQuest Worlds. This is where the player helps her defeat the Fears of Heights, the Fear of the Dark, and the Fear of Death and even the personification of Fear. Ayi Jihu has been developing the Fear Chaser Chronicles franchise movie property with her manager and producer Stevie Eagle Ellis and independent producer James With. An early treatment has now been developed into a full feature screenplay. In January 2014, Ayi Jihi embarked on a new series of performances around the world and commenced recording of new songs in London's Battery Studios. A new song from Brazilian artist Edu Casanova with the legendary Tito Jackson has been released. Ayi performed it in Brazil with Edu Casanova.

Like all the CF Army Military Police Regiments, while they reside within the Regular Force, the units are actually \\"total force\\" units comprising both a regular and reserve component. The Regular component consists of the headquarters and a policing platoon in Gagetown, New Brunswick. The Reserve component consists of a company of three platoons located in Halifax, Nova Scotia and Moncton, New Brunswick.  Background   Recent history  The Military Police in Halifax trace their roots back to World War I where, in 1917, the Canadian Military Police Corps (CMPC) was stood up and Number 6 Detachment was formed. Their main duty was to maintain discipline, enforce the Conscription Act, and apprehend deserters and draft evaders. The CMPC was stood down in 1920. The Reserve MP Companies in the Canadian Army Primary Reserve trace their roots back to the Provost Companies formed during WWII although none of the Reserve Companies have their homes in the places that saw the birth of these wartime companies. The existing company in Halifax traces its roots back to Number 5 Provost Company, which was established after the conclusion of World War II. The company was headquartered in Halifax with detachments in Halifax and Moncton. In 1967 the Canadian Forces unified, causing the three service's policing elements to be brought together to form the Security Branch. As a result, the Provost Corps was disbanded and the existing Army Reserve Provost Platoons (Pl) in the Maritimes, which had grown to five, were each placed under the command of the new Service Battalions and titled Military Police Platoons (MP Pls). They were numbered 31, 32, 33, 36, and 37 MP Pls, which matched their Service Battalion numbers. On 5 October 1997, under Reserve Restructure, Directive 7, and as a result of a number of studies concerning the Reserve MP Pls, they were removed from the Service Battalions and amalgamated into a single independent platoon in Halifax named 30 MP Pl. It was the first independent reserve MP unit in Canada and reported to the Commander of 36 Canadian Brigade Group (CBG). The platoon then moved from Willow Park to 12 Wing Shearwater. In 2003, under the Army Reserve Establishment, 30 MP Pl became 30 MP Company (Coy) with the addition of a second Pl. In September 2004, as a result of the second phase of the Land Force Reserve Restructure, Land Force Atlantic Area (LFAA) issued a Master Implementation Plan (MIP) for the stand up of 30 MP Coy as an Area direct report unit. This company was to consist of the existing 30 MP Pl from 36 CBG, the second Pl minus and Coy headquarters (HQ), all located in a leased facility in Lower Sackville, NS, and a third Pl created in Moncton, NB, from the reroll of a Pl from 4 Air Defence Regiment. By 2005 it was recognized within the Army that Military Police units needed more independence in order to carry out their policing function while centralization of resources would enhance the MPs ability to force generate people for operations. Therefore, in February 2005, and on order of the Army Commander, LFAA issued a draft MIP for the stand up of 3 Garrison MP Coy. This Coy consists of the 3 ASG Gagetown MP Detachment (Det) and the 2nd Bn Royal Canadian Regiment MP Det. On 3 March 2005, the Army Commander signed and issued the Implementation Directive for centralization of garrison MP resources in each Land Force Area. The creation of the garrison MP Coys was seen as an interim measures and, therefore, on 14 February 2006, the Army Commander signed the Implementation Directive for centralization of all Army MP resources at the Land Force Area level. This order authorized the creation of the MP Units in the four LFAs to be 1, 2, 3, and 5 MP Units. These units would consist of all Regular and Reserve Force Army MPs in each LFA. In LFAA this involved 3 Grn MP Coy (the garrison platoon in Gagetown), 30 MP Coy, the 2 RCR MP Det, and the Area Provost Marshal's Office. In May 2006, LFAA issued its MIP for the formation and support of 3 MPU. Further, staffing of various full and part-time positions commenced. On 1 October 2006, the amalgamation of 30 MP Coy, 3 Grn MP Coy, and the HQ commenced. On 18 December 2006, the Minister of National Defence issued the Ministerial Organizational Order (MOO) authorizing the creation and stand-up of all MPUs, including 3 MPU. In September 2007, the unit's Canadian Forces Organizational Order was issued. Further professionalization of the Canadian Military Police occurred when on 7 July 2010, the Chief of Defence Staff ordered that all Military Police would come under the full command of the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal, effective 1 April 2011. In March 2011 the Minister of National Defence authorized all the MPU's names to be changed to MP Regiments. As a result, on 1 April 2011, 3 MPU became 3 Military Police Regiment. Announced officially in 2014, the old location of 3 Military Police Regiment HQ (at 70 First Lake Drive, Lower Sackville, NS B4C 3E4) moved to the new Maj Robert Campbell Risley Armoury (255 Damascus Rd., Bedford, NS, B4A 0C2).

The grant included present-day French Camp and Stockton.Dise√±o del Rancho Campo de los Franceses History Karl David Weber (1814-1881), born in Steinwenden Germany, immigrated to America in 1836. After spending time in Texas, he came overland from Missouri to California with the Bartleson-Bidwell Party in 1841. Shortly after his arrival, Karl began calling himself Charles. Weber went to work for John Sutter, who vouched for \\"Carlos Maria Weber\\" to the Mexican authorities. In 1842, Weber settled in the Pueblo of San Jos√© and became a business partner of Guillermo (William) Gulnac. William Gulnac (1801-1851), born in Hudson, New York, was a blacksmith and fur trapper who came to the Pueblo of San Jos√© in 1833. He married Maria Cese√±a, sister of Liberata Cese√±a, the patentee of Rancho Laguna Seca, and became a naturalized Mexican citizen. He was elected regidor in 1839. Weber and Gulnac operated several businesses. They set up a corn-mill, ran a bakery and a smithy, mined for salt, made shoes and soap, and kept cattle and horses.\\"History Of Santa Clara County, California, 1881, Alley, Bowen & Co., San Francisco Gulnac, a Mexican citizen, petitioned Governor Micheltorena for a tract of land eleven leagues in extent, for the benefit of himself and eleven other families who were to assist him in forming a settlement. The governor ordered that the petitioner to say whether the grant was asked for a colony, and that if so the names of the families should be stated in the title; but if he desired it for himself individually, that he should ask for it within reasonable limits. The grant states that is for the benefit of Gulnac and his family and that of eleven other families; but their names are not mentioned. It may be presumed that the Governor finally determined to grant the land to Gulnac alone, leaving him to make such arrangements with the families who were to settle upon the land as he might see fit. Gulnac and Weber dissolved their partnership in 1843. Gulnac's attempts to settle the Rancho Campo de los Franceses failed, and he sold the land to Weber in 1845. In 1846, Weber induced a number of settlers to locate on the rancho, when the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War broke out. Weber was first considered a Californio and then an American. He was offered a captaincy by Mexican General Jos√© Castro, which he declined. He later became a captain in the cavalry of the United States. Captain Weber's decision to change sides lost him a great deal of the trust he had built up among his Mexican business partners. As a result, he sold his business in 1849. Weber moved to the grant in 1847, and laid out a town, which he named Tuleburg in 1849. Soon afterward he renamed it Stockton, in honour of Commodore Robert F. Stockton. As the head of navigation on the San Joaquin River, the city grew rapidly as a miners‚Äô supply point during the California Gold Rush. Weber himself set off for the gold fields, and worked there as a gold prospector and a merchant. Carl David Weber ‚Äì Adventurer and Town Founder Returning from the gold mines in 1850, Weber married Helen Murphy (1822‚Äì1895), daughter of Martin Murphy, owner of Rancho Ojo del Agua de la Coche. Helen and Charles moved to what is still Weber Point in Stockton and had three children: Charles Martin Weber (1851‚Äì1912), Julia Helen Weber (1853‚Äì1935) and Thomas Jefferson Weber (1855‚Äì1892).California History in her DNA Capt. Weber's brother, Adolf Weber (1825-1906), came from Germany to California in 1853 in search of his brother and settled in San Francisco, where he worked as a chemist at the State Mint and ultimately founded Humboldt Savings and Loan (1869).Capt. Charles M. Weber, San Joaquin County Biographies Weber Family Collection, 1836-1986 With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that land grants would be honored.

The latitude and longitude of Sheikhupur are 28.1 (N) and 79.7' respectively. Sheikhupur is not only the name of a town: It stands for a culture where learning flourished. The foundation of this historic township was laid more than three centuries ago by Farooqui Faridi Sheikh of Badaun, Shaikh Ibrahim Ali Farooqui aka Nawab Mohtashim Khan. He was the second son of Qutubuddin Koka (foster brother) of emperor Jahangir.Qutubuddin Koka#Progeny Ever since it was founded, Sheikhupur witnessed phases of its rise and fall like any other historic place. Sheikhupur still exists on the map and treasures the memories of its glorious past which helped to shape the history of Mughal India. Climate and agriculture The climate of Sheikhupur is the same as its surrounding areas. It is at a higher elevation and by a side of a river. Its soil is excellent for agriculture and crops being cultivated in the surrounding areas are grown here. Being close to Badaun yet at a distance from it, Sheikhupur possesses an identity of its own. Transportation Access to Sheikhupur is easy as a railway line passes through it apart from katcha{unmetalled} and pucca{metalled) roads from Badaun. The train going from Bareilly to Kasganj hails at Sheikhupur railway station. The Pucca road via Nawshera to Qadar Chowk passes through Sheikhupur and is a busy road through the day. The easiest road to take for Badaun is the Pucca Road running between Mauza Meeran Sarai and Ghalib Patti, going up to river Saut. Historic significance Sheikhupur is an area near Badaun, a city in the north-central Uttar Pradesh state of northern India. It is inhabited by Faridi branch of Farooqi Sheikhs. In the reign of Emperor Akbar the Farooqi Sheikhs became connected with the Mughal Empire. Its first member was Sheikh Salim Chishti, whose tomb at Fatehpur Sikri near Agra was built at the expense of the State. His grandson Nawab Qutubuddin Koka was the foster brother and private secretary of Emperor Jahangir and later governor of Bengal in the Mughal Empire.Ellison Banks Findly (March 25, 1993).

Success for Santelli usually meant a balloon afire. Here, an observer leaps for his life. During the Summer of 1918, beginning 22 May and running into July, Santelli triumphed in the extraordinarily hazardous task of shooting down seven German observation balloons. Given their elevated view of the battle grounds from the balloons' gondolas, aerial observers could gather and pass on vital military intelligence information. For that reason, fighter pilots from either side attacked and downed balloons; because of that, the balloons were heavily defended by antiaircraft guns and fighter patrols. Santelli's success was aided by the support offered by fellow aces Adrien L. J. Leps and Marcel Marc Dhome.The Aerodrome website page on balloon busters Retrieved 2 September 2020. By war's end, Paul Santelli had flown over 103 combat hours. For his valor, he was awarded the M√©daille militaire and the Croix de guerre.

It is restricted in the wild to South Africa's Western Cape province, where it grows in thickets along the banks of streams. The plant is of botanical interest as being Africa's only member of the large grevilleoid subfamily. It is a bushy small tree with branches widely at ground level and numerous erect vigorous stems. Leaves grow up to 6 in (15 cm) long, narrow and bluntly toothed, appear at intervals along the branches, mostly in whorls of 6. In summer, the plant bears white flowers densely crowded on spikes arising from rusty buds at the leaf axils. The fruits to 2 in (5 cm) long, magenta to reddish brown, similar to an almond, appear in autumn. The nut is too bitter to eat; however, in earlier times it was boiled, roasted, and ground to make a \\"coffee\\" drink. This tree has special significance in Cape Town's heritage, as it was used to make Van Riebeeck's Hedge - the Cape's first formal boundary. Parts of this original hedge can still be seen growing today at Kirstenbosch. Name Despite its common name, this tree is not a member of the almond family, and is in fact a type of Protea. It acquired the name \\"wild almond\\" simply because its fruits vaguely resemble almonds. The part-Khoi local name \\"ghoeboontjie\\" also refers to the fruit kernels and their use in traditional coffee.Marloth, Rudolf. The Flora of South Africa‚Äù 1932 Pub. Cape Town: Darter Bros. London: Wheldon & Wesley. The origin of the tree's genus name is uncertain, but its species name \\"stellatifolium\\" (meaning \\"star-leaved\\" or \\"stellate-leaved\\") is a reference to the star-shaped whorls in which its leaves grow. This is sufficiently unusual among tree species, that its whorled phyllotaxis is the most conveniently diagnostic characteristic of Brabejum stellatifolium in regions where the tree is common.Vogts, Marie Murray. Proteas. Know them and grow them. Afrikaanse Pers Boekhandel 1958 Appearance Brabejum is a spreading, multi-stemmed, well- shaped evergreen tree. It may grow as tall as 15 meters, but has wide spreading branches and a sprawling habit. The smooth bark is pale greyish- brown and attractively mottled. The green, leathery leaves are toothed and lance-shaped. They appear in whorls of about six, at intervals along the stems, radiating out from the branch like a star. Young leaves are soft, velvety and golden. The tiny, white, sweetly scented, bisexual flowers appear in summer, in dense racemes. The nut-like fruits look similar to almonds and grow in clusters at the tips of branches. They are densely covered with chocolate-brown velvety hairs. The young fruits are an attractive magenta or lilac-purple colour and mature to the typical brown later in the summer. The fruits are short-lived, germinate quickly and are often dispersed by rivers. The leaves of Brabejum are frequently disfigured by small knobs. These bubbles are the residences of tiny symbiotic mites. They do not harm the tree, but affected branches can be removed if they are found to be unsightly. Distribution The natural range of these trees is confined to the fynbos biome of the Cape, South Africa. Here they are often a component of the local Afro-montane forests. They prefer moist areas, and commonly occur near streams in sheltered gorges and on lower mountain slopes. In Cape Town they are still abundant on the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, although at one time large numbers were felled in this area to make way for commercial pine plantations. However, despite its limited range, this species is not currently listed as threatened. The natural occurrence of these trees in South Africa is of considerable interest to biologists. This is because Brabejum has no close relatives in Africa - within the enormous Protea family its nearest relative is the Macadamia tree of Australia and New Caledonia. Its other more distant relatives likewise exist only in Australasia and South America. In fact, not only is this species alone in its genus Brabejum, it is also the only member of its subfamily, Grevilleoideae, in Africa (the proteas that surround it in South Africa are relatively distant relatives). It seems that the ancient and spectacular Protea family originated in Gondwanaland, hundreds of millions of years ago. The different species were gradually separated by plate tectonics and their descendants still occur on the pieces of land that are now separated by thousands of miles of ocean. Brabejum is the lone survivor of its branch of the family on the African remnant of Gondwanaland. Growing Brabejum This is a relatively fast growing tree and is not suitable for the small garden. It has a tendency to spread out sideways and it can be used to form an impenetrable hedge. If correctly pruned, it can form a well-shaped tree. Wherever side branches are cut, more branches will grow from below the cut, so it is readily shaped into a good screen. Older trees form an enormous jungle of giant tangled boughs and sprawling branches, making the trees popular with children. Brabejum is best propagated by fresh seed. The nuts can simply be pushed into the ground as they are, and they germinate as soon as they are on firm, damp soil. However, the seeds do not survive long if they cannot germinate or if they dry out. Ensure that the seedlings get sufficient water in their first few years, preferably by planting them in a damp, shady area like a river bank.Brabejum stellatifolium PlantZAfrica.com Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden.

It inhabits sandy, muddy, or rocky coastal habitats in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the southern Mediterranean Sea. This dark-colored ray typically reaches a width of , and can be identified by its nearly circular pectoral fin disk, short tail, and mostly bare skin. The round fantail stingray hunts for fishes and crustaceans on the sea floor, and exhibits an aplacental viviparous mode of reproduction. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have sufficient information to assess the conservation status of this species. Taxonomy French naturalist √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire originally described the round fantail stingray in 1817 as Trygon grabatus, from the Latin grabatus meaning \\"bed\\".Catalog of Fishes (Online Version). California Academy of Sciences. Retrieved on November 14, 2009. His account was published in the first volume of the folio Poissons du Nil, de la mer Rouge et de la M√©diterran√©e. Subsequent authors moved this species to the genus Taeniura. No type specimens are known. Distribution and habitat A round fantail stingray off Tenerife in the Canary Islands The round fantail stingray is found in the tropical to subtropical waters of the eastern Atlantic from Mauritania to Angola, as well as off the Canary Islands, Madeira, and Cape Verde. This species has also recently colonized the southern Mediterranean Sea, where it is now occasionally sighted from Tunisia to Egypt, with isolated records from off Turkey and Tuscany, Italy. However, it is not one of the many Lessepsian migrants, and reports of this species being present in the Red Sea may be erroneous. Found at depths of , the round fantail stingray favors coastal sandy, muddy, or rocky areas. Description The round fantail stingray has a nearly circular pectoral fin disk slightly wider than long. The tail measures no longer than the disk length and bears one or more stinging spines on the upper surface. The spines average long in males and in females, and have a central groove and 29-45 lateral serrations. Replacement spines grow in front of the primary spine. There is a deep fin fold running beneath the tail from the level of the spine almost to the tip. The skin is mostly smooth, save for small dermal denticles found along the middle of the back from the spiracles to the tail spine, as well as three thorns on the \\"shoulders\\". The coloration is dark gray to brown to olive above, with various darker mottling, and off-white below. This species typically grows up to across and long, though it has been reported to a length of . It can weigh as much as .Francis, W. (1968). \\"Report on the Guinean Trawling Survey, Volume 1\\". NODC general series, OAU/STRC publication 99. Biology and ecology The eye of a round fantail stingray, with the large spiracle behind Little is known of the natural history of the round fantail stingray. A predator of bottom-dwelling crustaceans and fishes, during the day this species can often be found partially buried in sediment, under ledges, or lying in the open spaces between reefs. Known parasites of the round fantail stingray include the monogeneans Dendromonocotyle taeniurae and Neoentobdella apiocolpos, which infest the skin, and Heterocotyle forcifera, H. mokhtarae, and H. striata, which infest the gills, and the tapeworm Rhinebothrium monodi, which infests the spiral valve intestine. It has been observed being attended to by the cleaner shrimp Hippolysmata grabhami. Like other stingrays, this species is aplacental viviparous. Human interactions Potential threats to the round fantail stingray are commercial fisheries utilizing bottom trawls and trammel nets, but no specific data on utilization or population impact are available. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient. It has been observed sheltering near artificial reefs in the Canary Islands.

Many of the Assyrians of the Gazarta region, including the bishop of Gazarta Pilipus Yaqub Orahim, were killed during the Assyrian Genocide during 1914-1918. On 3 July 1957, it was suppressed and its territory divided between the Chaldean Catholic Diocese of Diarbekir (Amida), the Chaldean Catholic Diocese of Aleppo and the newly established Chaldean Catholic Diocese of Beirut.  Chaldean bishops of Gazarta  The first nineteenth-century bishop of Gazarta was Giwargis Peter di Natale, who was consecrated for Gazarta in 1833 by the patriarch Yohannan VIII Hormizd and transferred to the diocese of Amadiya in 1842. The patriarch Nicholas I Zaya appointed Basil Asmar, previously administrator of the diocese of Amid, to the diocese of Gazarta in 1842. Basil was metropolitan of Gazarta for nine years, and Badger noted in 1850 that 'he seldom resides at Jezeerah'.Badger, Nestorians, i. 69 He retired due to old age and ill health in 1851. The patriarch Joseph VI Audo sent the priest Abdisho Dosho (later metropolitan of Amadiya) to Gazarta in his place for a year, and appointed Jerome Paul Hindi metropolitan of Gazarta in 1852. Hindi was metropolitan of Gazarta until 1873, and was succeeded by Eliya Peter Abulyonan (1874‚Äì8), who became patriarch in 1879 after Audo's death. In 1875, the monk Philip Abraham of the monastery of Notre Dame des Semences, who was born in Telkepe in 1848 and became a priest in 1873, was consecrated metropolitan for India by Joseph VI Audo, who was then challenging the authority of the Padroado jurisdiction in India. He was recalled from India in 1881 by Eliya XII Abulyonan on instructions from the Vatican, and was transferred to the diocese of Gazarta in 1882, taking the name Mar Yaqob. He was among the many Chaldean clergy murdered in the Armenian massacres of 1915. He was the last metropolitan of Gazarta. The Assyrian population of the Gazarta district was greatly reduced in the First World War in the Assyrian Genocide, and the diocese of Gazarta was not revived afterwards.  Population statistics  In 1867 the diocese of Gazarta contained 20 villages and had a population of 7,000 Assyrians, served by 10 qashe (priests). In 1896 the diocese had a population of 5,500 Assyrians, and contained 16 parishes or stations, 20 churches, and 14 qashe (priests), assisted by a Dominican mission and a mission of the Sisters of Preservation at Gazarta (Chabot). The largest villages in the diocese were Gazarta, Hoz and Mer, Harbol, Peshabur, Taqian, Girik Bedro, Wasta and Tel Qabin. In 1913 the diocese included 17 villages, and had 17 qashe (priests) and 6,400 civilians (Tfinkdji). The diocese was ruined in the First World War during the Assyrian Genocide, and in 1928 there were only 1,600 Assyrians remaining in its former territory, without a qasha (priest) (Tisserant). In 1937 there were 2,250 Assyrians, with a qasha (priest) and a church (Kajo).

The origin and the birth of this game is unknown. Today this game has completely vanished due to urbanization and invasion of western games. Four independent boxes are drawn on plane ground as shown in the figure. The blue line indicates the path along which the danner moves and the orange lines indicate the path along which the players move. A danner is decided after the chain cut. Objective Four players stand in their squares and four stones one above the other are placed at the center. The objective of each player is to have a stone without being captured by the danner. The objective of the danner is to capture the players who move in their way. Strategy When the game starts, the danner keeps moving along his path to capture the players who try to pick up the stones. The danner is not supposed to enter into the boxes. One of the players take initiative to pick up all the stones and tries to move into any of the boxes one by one and distributes the stones to the other players. However it is not necessary that only one player should take initiative in picking up all the stones, but every player can pick up any number of stones for distribution. When each player picks up at least one stone by default, there is no need of distribution. When all the players get their stones, they would ask the danner to choose either \\"Gumpu\\" (Group) or \\"Chuttu\\" (circling). When the danner chooses Gumpu, and selects a particular box, then all other players carefully gather in the selected box, with the stones in their hands. For the choice of Chuttu, each player will have to make 6 rounds and finally reach their native box. A player, while shifting to other boxes, is declared to be out when he/she is touched by the danner. The game continues as long as one of the players is out.

It is the largest active landfill in New York State, as well as Seneca County's fourth largest industrial employer. At peak times, the company employs more than 160 full-time workers. In 2005, it accepted more than 6,000 tons of garbage a day from multiple states (then three). The height limit was . Methane gas is sent to a nearby independent facility for producing electricity, some of which Seneca Meadows buys back for its own power needs. Seneca Meadows began producing gas for electricity in 1995, then producing 2.4 Megawatts. Today it produces 18 Megawatts, enough to power 15,000 to 18,000 homes. Seneca Meadows parent company, IESI Corporation, claims that the revenue of the landfill is around $48 million. History The landfill accepts trash from New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. It will continue its operation through at least 2023. The site was first created in 1953 and owned by the Tantalo Construction. Tantalo Construction was later purchased and the corporation's name was changed to Seneca Meadows Inc. Seneca Meadows Inc. was later purchased by Canadian company IESI. Seneca Meadows recycles about two million tires a year, making it one of the largest tire recyclers in the country. The tires are chopped up and the chips used in place of stone for drainage. In 2007, a expansion was added that was estimated to provide 14 years of landfilling. In 2009, Seneca Meadows opened its Environmental Education Center, a LEED Gold Certified building, which uses geothermal heat. Environmental related courses and labs for area schools are held there by the Audubon Society staff. The building was part of a wetland creation project which the landfill was required to do because natural wetland was taken by the landfill during expansion. The amount and extensiveness of the wetland created, however, was far beyond the minimum requirement, exceeding 1,000 acres in total.Retrieved November 5, 2010 In a pre-election event in 2010, New York State Senate challenger Edward O'Shea questioned his Republican opponent Mike Nozzolio for accepting a $4,000 campaign donation from Seneca Meadows. Nozzolio won re-election. In 2015, a US$3.3 billion, 20-year contract to haul trash to Seneca Meadows from New York City by train moved towards approval. A railyard would be built adjacent the landfill to replace many of the current 50 trucks a day, carrying 1,415 tons, with approximately 30-car trains.

Colt had discontinued this model in 1940. The Great Western revolver was sold by mail order in the 1950s and early 1960s, and was used in many Western movies and television shows. History Colt‚Äôs model 1873 single action ‚ÄúPeacemaker‚Äù revolver was iconic by the early 20th century as the ‚Äògun that won the West‚Äô. Colt continued to produce it through the 1930s though it was by then functionally antiquated compared to modern revolvers and pistols. Sales dwindled to almost nothing in the Depression, and when WWII broke out in Europe, Colt dropped the SAA to focus production resources on its military arms contracts. After the war, film and television spurred renewed interest in the SAA but Colt was not immediately persuaded to resume production. In the Los Angeles area an enterprise to produce an SAA copy coalesced around Northrup engineer William R. Wilson, mail-order impresario Hy Hunter, and several firearm professionals from nearby Weatherby. This group started production of the Great Western Arms Frontier SAA revolver in 1954. The Great Western Arms enterprise operated for about ten years, but never overcame domestic and foreign competitors that also introduced western style revolvers. The business was beset by regular insolvencies, and was twice surrendered to vendors holding account receivables. Los Angeles Rams executive Dan Reeves and Rams team physician Dan Fortmann are understood to have been the company's first capital investors, and Wilson‚Äôs backer [2][3]. The last proprietor was EMF Co, which still operates today as a firearms retailer. Over the 1954-64 period Great Western made about 22000 revolvers and 3300 derringers. Great Western's single action revolver was mostly identical to Colt's original version, save for a few modern improvements. It was notably identifiable for its stag pattern plastic grips. It was available in popular revolver calibers. Great Western's derringer was also a faithful reproduction, that of the Remington model 95. Marketing and use in films Wilson and Hunter courted spokesmen endorsers as they rolled out the Great Western Frontier revolver in 1954, and the gun became somewhat known for its association with 1950s Hollywood western film and TV production. John Wayne appeared on the company‚Äôs catalogs through its entire run. He was presented with two sets of engraved revolvers, one of these sets he used later in the 1976 film The Shootist. Audie Murphy and Mel Torme were other endorsers. A specially made Great Western revolver was built for Don Knotts in the Disney movie, The Shakiest Gun in the West; this revolver would comically fall apart when cocking the hammer. In 1955 Wilson sent unsolicited to President Eisenhower an ornately engraved .38 revolver and a similar model to California Governor Goodwin J. Knight.

Office, now known as the Roebling Inn, is located on Scenic Drive in Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania, United States. It is a mid-19th century wooden house in the Greek Revival architectural style. It was originally built by the company, which operated the nearby Delaware and Hudson Canal, as its regional office. Sold in 1898 to Charles W. Shannon when the canal was shut down, it was converted into a boarding house, a single-family private residence, and most recently a bed and breakfast. It remains mostly intact. In 1993 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Property The house is on an acre with two outbuildings along Scenic Drive, just off PA 590. It is a short distance north of Roebling's Delaware Aqueduct, one of the earliest suspension bridges in the United States, and a short distance south of the Zane Grey Museum. The property's lawn slopes gently down to the Delaware River to the east. A line of mature trees screens the property from some other residences nearby. Nearby are some filled-in sections of the canal. Most of the other property in the area is owned by the National Park Service as part of the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River. The building itself is a clapboard-sided gable-roofed frame structure two and a half stories tall on a foundation of random coursed stone. Its main block is five bays wide by two deep. Greek Revival detailing includes a frieze at the roofline and a transom and sidelights on the centrally-located main entrance. A two-story bay window projects from the south elevation. On the west side is a one-and-half-story, three-bay kitchen wing, added later. It has similar detailing to the main block. On its south side is a small porch, with a gently sloped roof supported by four square wooden columns. A cinder block chimney, the only one on the house, rises on the west. Inside the house retains much of its original central-hall floor plan, minimally altered for its current use. Many rooms retain their original plaster finish. The attic's plaster walls and ceiling are unusual for a house of its era. There are no fireplaces, although a wooden ornamental mantel remains in the dining room. There are two outbuildings: a carriage house and a cottage. Both are of similar material and design to the main house, but are not considered contributing resources to the National Register listing as their construction dates to the years after the canal company's ownership. History Local records show the company owning the land as early as 1852, the year after the death of early canal administrator Thomas Tracey. It took several employees to do his duties, and the company began to develop a bureaucracy, with large houses along the canal's route for local administrators. No official company document survives designating this Lackawaxen property the Delaware and Hudson's regional office. That belief is instead supported by maps, company policies, physical evidence and local tradition. Since this section of the canal had frequent washouts, and it was close to the Delaware Lackawaxen aqueducts, which required regular maintenance, a regional administrator may well have seen this as an ideal site. It could also be used to keep an eye on the Lackawaxen Dam, which the company had stopped using once the aqueducts had been built but remained as a possible liability risk. The original house, in 1855, was just the main block. Around 1870, the wing was added. One company official known to have lived here was Thomas Ridgway, a former judge and regional administrator from 1876 until his death in 1888. Among surviving records are his tallies of lumber rafts going over the dam and under the aqueduct. This was to help reconcile claims they made against the company for damage to their rafts. As with other administrators, the building was both his home and his office. The finished attic probably served as lodging for workers brought in during high- maintenance periods. A man named C.W. Shannon bought the building when the company abandoned the canal for its railroad interests in 1898. He converted it into a boarding house, taking in as many as 20 guests a week. His son ran his medical practice from here, and built the small cottage in the rear to see patients, as well as the carriage house. As boardinghouses declined, the building became a private residence. In 1985 the present owners bought it and converted into a bed and breakfast.

Within the fiddling community, it is often referred to simply as \\"Weiser,\\" and the contest draws musicians from across the country.The Story Of The Oregon Old Time Fiddlers Association 1967 - 2000, President Fred Hardin Preserving History Through Newspaper Clippings 1960s -- 2005 Oregon Old Time Fiddlers History Book Vol. Two Nearly 7,000 attend for the week and almost 350 fiddlers compete in eight divisions. In addition to the contest there are workshops, performances, a battle of the bands, a parade and a carnival. The contest is held at Weiser High School: the competition is held in the gymnasium, and most of the contestants camp in the school‚Äôs sports fields. History The contest began in 1953 as the Northwest Mountain Fiddlers' Contest, organized by Blaine Stubblefield, secretary of the Weiser Chamber of Commerce. The contest increased in size each year, and competitors came from farther away. The name was changed to the Northwest Oldtime Fiddling Championships in 1956, when a regional division was added for out-of-area fiddlers. In 1963, the present National Oldtime Fiddlers' Contest was inaugurated. The contest has continued to grow since then, and now sets the standard for fiddling competitions across the nation. Style The dominant style of fiddling that is played in the competition is Texas Contest Style, although there are many other fiddling styles which are played during jam sessions that last well into the night. There are also performances on the contest stage between rounds of competition, where the fiddling styles range from swing to bluegrass to Celtic. Rules Each fiddler plays a set (or 'round') of three tunes, which must include a hoedown, a waltz, and a tune of choice, which can neither be a waltz or a hoedown. The fiddlers with the highest scores move on to the next round of competition. The number of fiddlers that get to play in each round is decided before the contest starts. In all divisions, only five fiddlers compete in the final round of competition and scores are cumulative throughout the contest. The contest is divided into seven divisions: Small Fry, for contestants less than nine years of age; Junior-Junior, for contestants less than 13 years of age; Junior, for contestants less than 18 years of age; Young Adult, for ages 18‚Äì36; Adult, ages 37‚Äì59; Senior, ages 60 and above; and finally, Grand Champion, which is open to competitors of any age. No competitor may enter more than one of these divisions. There is no competition between divisions. There are three rounds of competition for the Small Fry and Junior-Junior divisions, four for the Junior, Young Adult, Adult, and Senior divisions, and six for the Grand Championship. If a contestant wins an age specific division three times, they can no longer compete in that division, but they may play in the next most competitive division the next year (Small Fry and Junior-Junior move up to the next age group, all other ages move up to the Grand Championship). If a fiddler wins the Grand Championship three years, they are asked to sit out a year, and are invited to judge the contest instead of competing. Contestants may perform with up to three accompanists, and no contestant may play the same tune twice. There is a time limit of four minutes for rounds one through three, five minutes for rounds four and five, and no time limit for the final round of the Grand Champion division. All contestants must use the microphone provided. No sheet music is allowed on stage and there is no 'trick' or 'fancy fiddling,' nor can there be any cross tuning on stage. Anyone may enter the contest. Judging The judging criteria are: oldtime fiddling style, danceability, rhythm and timing, and tone quality. A simple tune, played well, is scored higher than a difficult tune that is played poorly. There are five judges and each gives up to a maximum score of 100 for each tune a fiddler plays. The highest and lowest scores for the round are thrown out, leaving the middle three round scores to be added to a player's cumulative total (a perfect score for one round is 900). The judges are often fiddlers who have won the Grand Championship in the past, or fiddlers who are well known in other styles of fiddle music. To reduce bias, judging is done from a room away from the competition area; judges only hear the number of the competitor and the performance, but this does not prevent judges from recognizing fiddlers by their style. The exception is the final round of the Grand Championship, with the judges in the front row, next to the stage.

It is the only Anglican church in Polokwane (previously, Pietersburg). The church has a long and diverse history going back over a hundred years.  History  Pietersburg was founded in 1886 and by 1895 there were about 800 residents. Prior to 1894 there had been occasional services for the English Church held by visiting priests in the local Court House. In 1894, Hugh Bousfield, son of Henry Bousfield, the first Bishop of Pretoria, was prospecting near Pieterburg. A congregant, E.G. Ireland, later Pietersburg's first mayor, impressed upon Bousfield the need for the bishop to visit Pietersburg.Diocese of Pretoria Website: Historical Documents In 1895 a message was again sent to the Bishop of Pretoria, telling him there was a strong feeling that he should visit the area and make arrangements to establish the church on a more permanent basis. The bishop duly arrived and agreed to provide a clergyman for the town and district. A. Weinstein arrived soon afterwards and in his first service on 12 May 1895 preached on \\"God‚Äôs love to Men.\\" The first entry in the Vestry Book of the \\"English Church in Pietersburg\\" is a statement of accounts for the period 12 May 1895 to 31 March 1896. Work began on building a church in Market Street in 1895 and two years later the work was completed. In 1897 it is recorded that services were also held out at Leydsdorp, Spelonken and Nylstroom (now, Modimolle). Members of the congregation otherwise had to trek many miles to attend services in Pietersburg. In the 1898 register, prayers for smallpox and drought were recorded. On several occasions no services were held because of heavy rains. During 1899 church attendance dropped as church members left town because of the threat of war. The last meeting of the church council, before the Anglo-Boer war (Boer Wars), took place on 2 August 1899. By that November only twenty British subjects were left in Pietersburg. Church records are sparse during the war, but it appears that the rector may have even been imprisoned during 1900. Church services resumed in November 1901. After the war, accessible records from old Service Registers, Council Minutes and Vestry Minutes settle into a familiar pattern: car and building maintenance, fund-raising, church attendance and the arrival or departure of rectors.Parish of Christ Church Registers In 1931 the site of the present church (erf. 569, corner of Devenish and Biccard Streets) was purchased complete with a house for use as the Rectory. In 1949 a building fund was started and in 1951 a definite decision was taken to build a new church on the Rectory site. The old building was showing its age, termites had got into the walls and fear was expressed that the roof would eventually become dangerous. On 20 June 1957 the church celebrated its Diamond Jubilee. The guest preacher was Frank Clarke. In March 1960, the Vicar General, Frederick Amoore, laid the foundation stone of the new hall and vestry. The last service held in the old building that had served this congregation for over sixty years was held on Sunday, 25 September 1960. In July, 1968 Architects were commissioned to plan the new church and on Saturday 30 November, the foundation stone of the new church was laid by J.A. Goddard, This honour was accorded him in recognition of the many years of devoted and unbroken service he had given to Christ Church since 1927. In 1969 the church and a flat for the curate were completed at a cost of R35,500. The dedication of the church by the Bishop of Pretoria took place on Sunday, 10 August 1969.[Growing Up in Grace & Going Out in Love (1995)] In 1995 Christ Church celebrated a hundred years of an Anglican congregation in Polokwane / Pietersburg. Martin Breytenbach, the second bishop of the Anglican Diocese of St Mark the Evangelist resisted the call for many years to have a cathedral in the diocese. He, like his predecessor, Philip Le Feuvre, believed that the diocese was far from being established and so any talk of establishing a cathedral was premature.[Martin Breytenbach Ad Clerum: Winter (2010)] In 2009 the bishop began thinking about the needs of Polokwane itself. It is rapidly transforming from a small city into a full-scale city. The open land between Polokwane and Seshego is rapidly filling up with houses. New suburbs are opening up to the north, east and south. New shopping malls are opening up and existing ones are doubling in size. With the support of Chapter, the Trustees, Diocesan Standing Committee and Christ Church Council, the bishop moved towards proclaiming Christ Church a cathedral in 2011. A dean was appointed as well as a sub-dean. (Consequently, the list of Rectors was discontinued and a new list of Deans and Sub-Deans started.) Christ Church was consecrated a cathedral on 18 June 2011.

It is mandated to primarily offer higher professional, technical instructions for special purposes and promote research and extension services, advanced studies and progressive leadership in education, agriculture, fishery, engineering, arts and sciences, short-term vocational-technical and other continuing courses as may be relevant. It shall also provide primary consideration to the integration of researches/ studies for the development of the Province of Misamis Occidental.Philippine Republic Act No. 4878 Section 2 Its main campus is located in Labuyo, Tangub City, Misamis Occidental. History The Northwestern Mindanao State College of Science and Technology (NMSC) started as Tangub Agro-Industrial School (TANAIS) in Sumirap, Tangub City way back in 1971 offering secondary agriculture and trade curricula with Mr. Jesus T. Bonilla as principal. On June 26, 1973, the school was transferred to Labuyo, Tangub City three kilometers from the city proper and approximately four hundred meters from the national highway, with Dr. Perfecto B. Yebes as the Vocational School Administrator. The school started offering post secondary courses in 1974 and had been an affiliate off campus institute of the Central Mindanao University, Musuan, Bukidnon from 1979 to 1984. In 1994, Bachelor's Degree in Secondary Education and Industrial Technology were then offered. With the promotion of Dr. Yebes to a higher position, Mr. Apolonio S. Vidallo took place of the former and was appointed as the third administrator of TANAIS on August 6, 1996. Prior to Dr. Yebes' promotion, in 1992 he and Atty. Philip T. Tan, the City Myor of Tangub at that time, conceived the idea of converting TANAIS into a state college. The proposal was filed in Congress by the late Hon. Hilarion Ramiro Jr., the Congressman of the 2nd District of Misamis Occidental at that time. The bill was not passed due to adjournment or the 9th Congress in 1995. The bill to convert TANAIS into a State College was refilled in the 10th Congress in 1995 by Congresswoman Herminia M. Ramiro. The bill passed both houses but with a last minute amendment to transfer the main campus from TANAIS in Tangub City to Oroquieta Agro-Industrial School (OAIS) at Oroquieta City. Learning the amendment, Mayor Tan and Mr. Numeriano L. Gilbolingo and conferred with Congresswoman Herminia M. Ramiro to find the constitutional ground and had bill vetoed by President Fidel V. Ramos. The bill was refiled in 1998 by the late Congressman Hilarion A. Ramiro Jr. It has already passed the lower house in 2000. By December 2000, Congressman Ramiro, Mayor Philip T. Tan, wife Jennifer Wee Tan and Mr. Numeriano L. Gilbolingo who represented Administrator Apolonio S. Vidallo successfully defended the conversion of Tangub Agro-Industrial School into Northwestern Mindanao State College of Science and Technology (NMSC) before the Senate Committee on Education chaired by the Honorable Sen. Teresita Aquino Oreta with the endorsement of Dr. Ester A. Garcia, Chairperson of the Commission on Higher Education. Unfortunately, Congressman Ramiro died in January 2001. Congresswoman Herminia A. Ramiro was elected in May 2001, replacing the late Congressman Hilarion Ramiro Jr. With joint effort of Atty. Philip T. Tan and Congresswoman Herminia A. Ramiro, R.A. 9146 was finally approved by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on July 30, 2001. Dr. Zenaida G. Gersana was then designated by the Commission on Higher Education as the Officer-In-Charge and the Board of Trustees (BOT) was created to serve as its governing body. On May 26, 2003, the Board of Trustees unanimously elected and appointed Atty. Philip T. Tan, CPA as the First President of NMSC after a two-month exhaustive selection process conducted by the Search Committee for Presidency (SCP). Dr. Glory S. Magdale, former Regional Director of the Commission on Higher Education, Region X, Cagayan de Oro City chaired the Search Committee for the Presidency. During the Presidency of Atty. Tan, infrastructure projects flourished in the college. Among these are the twenty-classroom Academic Building, the Legarda Hall which is a laboratory building for students enrolled in Hospitality Management, Student Food Court and renovated Administration Offices. The projects significantly improved the physical facilities of the college. The College occupies a total of 29 hectares campus site traversed by the barangay road leading to Panguil Bay, an area rich in marine resources with vast potentials suitable for home and industrial uses. With the initiative of Atty. Philip Tan, the Php 5.4 Million pesos financial assistance from the Department of Science and Technology for the upgrading of the Science laboratory of the college was finally approved. Upon the resignation of Atty. Philip T. Tan as College President in order to head the call to go back to public service as Mayor of Tangub City, Dr. Ricardo E. Rotoras, the visionary and dynamic President of Mindanao University of Science and Technology (MUST) was designated by the Board of Trustees as Officer In-Charge of the College in March 2010 by virtue of BOT Resolution No. 03,s. 2010. With the active and participative leadership of Dr. Rotoras, the College hurdled its share of challenges and the second release of the DOST financial assistance was undertaken. On September 6, 2012, Dr. Jennifer W. Tan was unanimously elected and appointed by the Board of Trustees as second President of the college by virtue of BOT Resolution No. 26,s. 2012.

History The parish of Weston Colville forms a long thin area of 3235 acres stretching from just south of the A11 to the Suffolk border. It is wedged between the parishes of Carlton-cum-Willingham to the north and West Wratting to the south, and has a short border with both Great Wilbraham and Little Wilbraham to the northwest. The site has been occupied since at least the 10th century, and there were 40 residents registered at the time of the Domesday Book. By 1150 the manor was owned by the Stutville family. After the death of Anselm de Stutville in around 1198, the land passed to his sister Beatrice, who married William de Colville, lord of Castle Bytham in around 1200. From then until 1708 the manor remained in the hands of the Colville family, who added their name to the village which was hitherto known only as Weston (meaning \\"west town\\"). Between 1943 and 1947 the flat area south-east of the village was used as a bomber airfield during the Second World War known as Wratting Common. The buildings there also housed 2000 foreign refugees at one time. The area returned to agricultural use after 1952. J. R. Withers (1812‚Äì92), \\"the Cambridgeshire poet\\", was born at Weston Colville, son of the village shoemaker, though he lived at Fordham as an adult. Church The parish church of St Mary consists of a chancel with north vestry, nave with south porch, and west tower. The nave dates from the 14th century, with the tower added in the 15th century. The external stone dressings were mainly replaced by grey brick in the 1820s. Village life The population of the village is around 500. The village post office closed in December 2017 leaving few local services. There are no pubs remaining in the village. Former pubs include The Coopers Arms which opened in the late 18th century, The Three Horseshoes, north of Weston Green, which ran from 1800 until closing in 1957, and The Fox and Hounds south of the green, open in the mid-19th century, rebuilt in around 1940, but closed in the late 20th century. The Reading Room hosts local events, classes and a nursery and the village has a cricket club where Essex and England cricketer Tom Westley began his career.

It is mandated to provide higher technological and professional instruction and training in the fields of economics, agriculture, health, engineering, education, management, finance, accounting, forest research and conservation, business and public administration as well as short-term technical and vocational courses. It is also mandated to provide and promote research and extension services, advanced studies and progressive leadership in all areas of discipline and responsibilities.Philippine Republic Act No. 7352 Section 2 Its main campus is located in Daet, Camarines Norte. History The Camarines Norte State College originated from the Camarines Norte High School which was established in 1920. On June 23, 1973 Parliamentary Bill No. 2378 was approved and signed into law converting Camarines Norte High School to Camarines Norte National High School (CNNHS). On July 23, 1991, then Congressman Renato M. Unico introduced House Bill No. 31647 in the House of Representatives during its fifth Regular Session. After it was passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives, the bill was signed into law by then President Corazon C. Aquino on April 2, 1992 as Republic Act No. 7352 also known as ‚ÄúAn Act Converting the present Camarines Norte National High School in Municipality of Daet into a State College to be known as the Camarines Norte State College integrating for the purpose the Aba√±o Pilot Elementary School in Daet, Mercedes School of Fisheries in Mercedes, Camarines Norte National Agricultural School in Labo, and the Camarines Norte School of Arts and Trades in Jose Panganiban all in the province of Camarines Norte and appropriating funds thereof.‚Äù By virtue of Republic Act 7352, the governing body of the Camarines Norte State College was vested in the Board of Regents chaired by Hon. Armand V. Fabella, the Secretary of Education, Culture and Sports. The chair was represented by DECS regional Director for NCR Dr. Nilo S. Rosas, who presided over all meetings of the Board from 1992 to 1994. The first two years of existence as a State College were the most memorable and tumultuous experience on the part of the faculty and staff who were affected by the transformation of a secondary school into a higher educational institution. It was in 1994 when the new DECS Secretary, Hon. Ricardo Gloria assumed the post as chair of the Board of Regents. He was instrumental in making the CNSC grow from infancy, stand by itself and move towards the realization of its constituents‚Äô dreams and aspirations. In order to achieve a more coordinated and integrated system of higher education; to render them more effective in the formulation and implementation of policies on higher education; to provide for more relevant direction in their governance and ensure the enjoyment of academic freedom as guaranteed by the Constitution, the composition of the governing board was modified. This change in the CNSC governance was in consonance with Republic Act No. 8292, otherwise known as ‚ÄúThe Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997‚Äù signed into law by President Fidel V. Ramos. The Act is a consolidation of Senate Bill No. 1721 and House Bill No. 4525, passed by the Senate and House of Representatives on June 3, 1997 and May 29, 1997, respectively. It is aimed to provide ‚Äúfor the uniform composition and powers of the Governing Boards, the manner of appointment and term of office of the president of chartered State Universities and Colleges and for other purposes‚Äù. By virtue of this Act, the governing Board was renamed to Board of Trustees from Board of Regents. Dr. Angel C. Alcala, Chair of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), was named first Chair of the Board of Trustees until his retirement. He was replaced by the incumbent Chair of the CHED, Dr. Esther Albano-Garcia. As Chair and Presiding Officer of the Board of Trustees, she was represented by one of the CHED Commissioners, Dr. Mona Dumlao-Valisno. When Dr. Mona Valisno retired in September 2001, Dr. Cristina Damasco-Padolina took over the Chairmanship of the Board. The administration of the Camarines Norte State College was first vested in its officer-in-charge, Dr. Emma Canuto-Avellana, until the appointment of its first president, Dr. Lourdes Apuya-Cortez on July 11, 1994. The appointment of its second president, Dr. Floria Palacio-Tagarino in mid-July 2000, marked a new milestone in the history of Camarines Norte State College. The 3rd president of CNSC was vested to Dr. Wenifredo T. O√±ate, when he was elected by the BOT on August 5, 2004 and was sworn into office on August 16, 2004. Campuses The Camarines Norte National High School, now Main Campus, has an area of 8.4213 hectares, including the Eco Athletic Field. It houses the administration, College of Education, College of Administration, Graduate School, College of Arts and Sciences, Information Technology Center, College of Engineering and Industrial Technology Extension and the Main Library.

Running along the full south-eastern perimeter of Christianshavn and Holmen, it used to form a protective barrier towards the island of Amager. It consists of earthworks with 12 bastions and in front of it ran a moat, Stadsgraven, now forming a broad canal which separates Christianshavn from the rest of Amager. On the other side of Stadsgraven. on Amager, was a lower system of outworks called Christianshavns Enveloppe of which only the northern half survives. Along with Kastellet on the other side of the harbour, it is the only intact part of the fortification system. Today Christianshavns Vold serves as an important greenspace for Christianshavn's inhabitants. The southern half of the rampart is a municipal park whereas the northern portion is part of Freetown Christiania, a self-built, semi-autonomous community which has existed since the early 1970s. Part of Christiania is located on the far side of Stadsgraven and the two halves are connected by the Dyssebroen footbridge. History Ole J√∏rgen Rawert: Christianshavns Vold, 15 March 1842 As part of his endeavour to modernize Copenhagen's fortifications, Christian IV constructed Christianshavn as a fortified merchant's town at a shallow-watered, marshy area north of Amager to complete a fortification ring around Copenhagen. The town was laid out with low earthworks facing Amager. The rampart was constructed with four and a half bastions and a city gate, known as Amagerport, through which all traffic to and from Amager had to pass. B√ºlowsvej 22: One of the old villas located on the east side of the street In the 1670s, when Vestervold was extended to reach the sea, Christiansvold was moved and extended to match the new course of Vestervold. Only the two northernmost bastions, today known as L√∏vens Bastion and Elefantens Bastion, remained on their original location. The new Christianshavns Vold had 5 very large bastions. Around the entire complex was a moat with a protecting counterscarp. From 1682-92 Christianshavns Vold was again extended this time in northwards, to guard the entrance to the harbour and protect the new base for the Royal Fleet at what was to become known as Nyholm. The extension included 7 new bastions, named for members of the Royal family. The last extension of Christianshavns Vold was constructed as late as 1878-82, when a rampart was constructed along the eastside of the newly reclaimed Refshale√∏. Bastions The storage building Kalvebod Bastion The forge Kalvebod Bastion takes its name after Kalveboderne, the shallow waters which were located to the south of Copenhagen in what is now its Southern Docklands. The bastion contains two buildings. Magasinbygningen, the larger of the two, is a two-storey, L-shaped storage building from 1800. The other one is a small forge from 1757. Both are today owned by Karberghus, a privately owned property which mainly invests in historic properties. Enhj√∏rningens Bastion Enhj√∏rningens Bastion The former gunpowder magazine inside Enhj√∏rningens Bastion Enhj√∏rningens Bastion (The Unicorn's Bastion) dates from 1668-70. The bastion contains a gunpowder magazine from c. 1675 which was formerly used as a storage space by Copenhagen Municipality's park authority. It now serves as club house for Qajaq K√∏benhavn, a kayak club. The bastion has for centuries also housed various industrial enterprises. A large defunct chimney is left at the site. Panterens Bastio Enhj√∏rningens Bastion Panterens Bastion (The Panther's Bastion) contains a former military training facility for shooting with hand guns. The buildings, a complex of red brick buildings, has now been converted into apartments. An unnamed footbridge connects the bastion to Amager Boulevard on the other side of Stadsgraven. Elefantens Bastion Elefantens Bastion (The Elephant's Bastion) is located just south of Torvegade. It replaced M√∏llebastionen (The Mill Bastion) in 1667-70. A windmill, Breslaus M√∏lle, stood on the bastion from 1670 to 1842. L√∏vens Bastion L√∏vens Bastion (The Lion's Bastion) is located a little north of Torvegade. The bastion is home to Lille M√∏lle, a smock mill which replaced an older stub mill in 1783. The mill cap was removed in 1897 and it was later converted into a private residence.

It was named after John Bidwill, by John Lindley, after an initial description by Bidwill's friend William Herbert, simply because he, Bidwill, first took it to England in 1843. Bidwill had no other association with its breeding. The Macarthur family published an annual catalogue of their plants. Exports were also listed in this publication, with the 1845 edition noting that William Macarthur sent two hybrid coral trees known as Erythrina camdenensis to Conrad Loddiges and Sons, a well known Hackney nurseryman in London. This coral tree is believed to be the first Australian hybrid garden plant to be published in England, in 1847.Camden Park Estate and Belgenny Farm NSW Heritage Branch. Government of NSW.  Erythrina √ó bidwillii 'Blakei'  Erythrina √ó bidwillii 'Blakei', was grown from the same F1 hybrid cross, and still grows in the gardens at Camden Park. This was named by Macarthur after his convict gardener Edmund Blake, who was probably responsible for making the cross, which, incidentally was the first hybrid to be produced anywhere in the world between woody leguminous plants. It was described in a monograph on Erythrina as, \\"the best known and biologically most successful hybrid erythrina,\\" which adds, \\"it seems likely that not all the races grown today under the name are descendants of the original cross\\". There is some variation in the size of flowers and the intensity of their colouration.  Cultivation and propagation  Erythrina √ó bidwillii 'Camdeni' tends to follow its Erythrina crista-galli parent in forming a small tree, while Erythrina √ó bidwillii 'Blakei' follows the Erythrina herbacea parent in being a low-growing shrub, dying back to a rootstock each year. Both Erythrina √ó bidwillii cultivars are totally sterile hybrids that can be raised from cuttings, with some difficulty. It is more propagated by grafting onto seedlings of Erythrina crista-galli, one of their parents.

He succeeded his father, prince Vi≈°eslav, who ruled at the end of the 8th century. Radoslav was succeeded by his son, prince Prosigoj. According to De Administrando Imperio, compiled by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, during the reign of princes Vi≈°eslav, Radoslav and Prosigoj there was no war between the Serbian Principality and its eastern neighbour, the Bulgarian Khanate. Radoslav or his son was the ruler of Serbia during the uprisings (819‚Äì822) of Ljudevit Posavski against the Franks. According to the Royal Frankish Annals, in 822, Ljudevit went from his seat in Sisak to the Serbs, somewhere in western Bosnia. Under the same entry, the Royal Frankish Annals state that Serbs were controlling a great part of Dalmatia (\\"ad Sorabos, quae natio magnam Dalmatiae partem obtinere dicitur\\"). There is also a possibility that the oldest anonymous chronicler of Dubrovnik who mentions the legend of the founder of Dubrovnik to be Radoslav Belo, the grandson of the dethroned Serbian ruler Radoslav, who had returned from Rome to restore his patrimony. The Chronicle of the Dukljanin Priest (13th century) also mentions this legend too, expanding Radoslav Belo's role into the hinterland as well, attributing to him the Ras Eparchy and Ras. Analyzing both chronicles(Dubrovnik and the Chronicle of the Dukljanin Priest) one can conclude that the legend of Radoslav Belo and the transfer of the saint relics (Rome to Dubrovnik) has some historical relevance. In fact, Radoslav Belo is definitely a historical person and in all probability was descended from one of the dethroned Serbian rulers, while the myth on transferring relics from Rome to Dubrovnik and events concerning the Ras region was surely construed much later as was the case with many similar historical events of the past. The most evident conclusion that one can derive is the fact that at the beginning of the 9th century, a record existed in Dubrovnik concerning the transfer of saintly relics, to which the legend of Radoslav Belo was added. There is conclusive evidence that the legend of Radoslav Belo was already formed in the first half of the 11th century. During the reign of prince Radoslav, and his immediate predecessors and successors, the process of gradual Christianization of the Serbs was still going on, starting in the first half of the 7th century and finally ending by the middle of the 9th century.

The play ran from 1965 to 2001. Guinness Book of World Records in 1984 has mentioned it as the world's longest-running one man show. It is written in a mix of Urdu and Dakhani. Synopsis The protagonist is Rumsu, a Hyderabadi with a wife and several children, trying to make ends meet and thus incurring heavy debts, is played by the author himself. The comedy revolves around how Rumsu deals with friends and acquaintances from whom he has borrowed small sums of money to manage his family. Ramsu's wife is Bee Pasha who is troubled with her husband's low income and often complains of unable to manage household and demands for either food grains or a saree for herself to which Ramsu responds hilariously making rib-tickling comedy across the hall. The drama ends with a message to follow family planning and have minimum children thus promoting \\"small family happy family\\" concept \\"chota parivar sukhi parivar\\" of the family planning department.  History Babban Khan is from a middle-class family. Although a graduate, he was jobless. He faced heavy challenges to make both ends meet. Oldies in Hyderabad still remember his bad times very fondly \\"ek piyali chai pe bechara ek lateefa sunata tha bhai\\" he used to tell a joke and would accept a cup of tea. One day he scripted Adrak Ke Panje sitting under a lamppost and staged the very first show on 22 September 1965. To meet the theatre and advertisement expenses Khan had to sell his mother's \\"laccha\\" (a gold ornament worn by only married Indian women) for rupees 275. Out of which he paid 200 rupees to Ravindra Bharathi (the theatre), paid 35 rupees to print tickets for the show and gave the rest to this mother for \\"ration\\".http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/20000131/ina31063.html Before Adrak Ke Panje happened, Babban was a normal man on the street trying to eke out an existence for himself and his siblings. Adrak Ke Panje got written under the streetlights of Hyderabad in Agapura. In fact his life almost reads like a film story: Here was a man with no money who writes a comedy under the streetlights and then pawns his mother's mangalsutra to rent a hall and put up the play. On 22 September 1965, Adrak Ke Panje was staged for the first time. It was a massive flop, but a good samaritan came backstage later and gave him Rs 500 to continue with the show. The play was a resounding success and won accolades from all. The story of Adrak is borne out of the story of Babban. His parents were unaware of family planning. The result was that three brothers and four sisters died due to malnutrition and lack of proper medical care. In fact, Babban's parents refused to name him till he was 10 just in case he died too!. Written way back in 1965, Adrak is based on the theme of family planning. It is in the form of a one-man piece enacted by Babban himself. What makes the play popular was the comic note which transcends all barriers of time and place  Longest running one-man show  Adrak ke Panje is also the longest running one-man show, entered the Guinness Book of World Records in 1984, by then the drama had already completed 10 thousand shows. The play has been seen by an estimated 3 crore (30 million) people across 60 countries and in 27 different languages across the globe. The drama has surpassed Agatha Christie\`s The Mousetrap and Chorus Line having around 7-8 thousand showshttp://www.reachouthyderabad.com/newsmaker/nm98.htm The show was played from 22 September 1965 to 11 February 2001. Besides a mention in the Guinness Book of World Records in 1984 for the longest one-man show, this play has been seen by an estimated three crore people, staged in 60 countries around the globe, 25 cities in USA and 65 cities and towns in India. This has been the first play in the country to be computerised and translated into 27 foreign languages. What's more, this one-man show has run parallel to Dustin Hoffman's in New York and Khan's autographs have appeared in the Washington auditorium along with Michael Jackson and Frank Sinatra. The one-man show has travelled to over 60 countries in a span of 35 years. But after all these awe- inspiring statistics, Adrak Ke Panje and its creator Babban Khan have decided to ring down the curtains on the play. Etymology Adrak means Ginger and Panje means its offshoot. As ginger has many irregular offshoots, so does Rumsu's (Babban Khan) children in the drama‚Äîwithout any family planning.  Early life  Babban Khan's parents refused to name him till he was 10, fearing his death as his brothers and sisters had died earlier out of malnutrition‚Äîa result of penury running in the family. He hails from Aghapura. Attained wealth, fame and recognition through hard work and commitment and a strong zeal to succeed in life. The man is known to be very humble and now lives in Shanti Nager area of Hyderabad.  Babban Khan Acting Academy  Babban khan now runs acting academy in Hyderabad, India and admits only 8 students per year. He trains them personally and awards them a certificate of acting from Babban Khan's Academy  The last show  The last show of Adrak Ke Panje was on 11 February 2001, completing 10,180 shows in a span of 35 years.http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/2001/jan/6028.htm  Next Show  Babban Khan, who grew up in penury and scripted Adrak-ke-Panje under a streetlight, presently is also busy giving final touches to a sequel to the hugely popular serial. Then there is a new play Gumbad-ke-Kabutar, which is almost ready to hit the stage. Poking fun at corruption in the day-to-day life, Gumbad-ke-Kabutar is scheduled to make a debut around June. He refuses to reveal details about the play except adding with a wink, \\"just wait for the show. You will enjoy it\\".http://hindu.com/thehindu/lf/2002/02/07/stories/2002020701230200.htm  Snippets  (1) Audience clap for continuously 16 minutes in New York (2) The sherwani used in the drama is still the same, stitched by his tailor in exchange of two free tickets for the very first show! Babban Khan's drama has preserved a part of life existing in Hyderabad in 1960's, with no options to secure a government job educated youth used to wander in search of a livelihood day in day out. The drama clearly portrays characters that were existing in Hyderabad in those days, such as Nawab Saab his house owner, who comes to collect his 8 months rent which is due on Ramsu. While arguing for money, Nawab Saab boasts of having an unani formula that would earn him a handsome money he calls it Khamira Gouzubaa a popular tonic for enhancing mental capabilities or memory. The drama is full of punches in typical Hyderabadi Urdu.

History Jose Rizal Memorial State University was established by virtue of RA 9852 with Congresswoman Cecilia G. Jalosjos-Carreon as principal author, Congressman Cesar Jalosjos as co-author. It was approved by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on December 15, 2009. It was formerly the Jose Rizal Memorial State College by virtue of RA 8193 sponsored by Congressman Romeo G. Jalosjos of the 1st District of Zamboanga del Norte which was approved on June 11, 1996, by the President of the Republic, Fidel V. Ramos. It was a consolidation of the Rizal Memorial Vocational School (RMNVS) in Dapitan City, the Zamboanga del Norte School of Arts and Trades (ZNSAT) in Dipolog City which was formed in 1961, and the Siocon National Vocational School (SNVS) in the Municipality of Siocon, Zamboanga del Norte. In 2002, two higher education institutions (HEIs) within Zamboanga del Norte, namely the Katipunan National Agricultural School (KNAS) in the municipality of Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte and the Zamboanga del Norte Agricultural College (ZNAC) in the Municipality of Tampilisan, Zamboanga del Norte (which was then a part of the Western Mindanao State University system), were integrated into then JRMSC pursuant to CHED Memorandum Order No. 27 series of 2000 thus comprising the fourth and fifth campuses, respectively of JRMSU. The first president was Dr. Felipe O. Ligan, who was appointed in 1997. On June 7, 2002, CHED Special Order No. 35, s. 2002 appointed Dr. Henry A. Sojor as the OIC President of the Jose Rizal Memorial State College in concurrent capacity as president of Central Visayas Polytechnic College in Dumaguete City, now Negros Oriental State University. In the span of two years and eight months, the board of trustees then deemed it best for the college to have its permanent leader. Thus, on March 1, 2005, Dr. Edgar S. Balbuena assumed office as the second president of JRMSC pursuant to BOT Resolution No. 04, series of 2005 chaired by Fr. Rolando V. Rosa, OP. With the appointment of Dr. Balbuena, the college charted a new course. With his extraordinary leadership, it took only four years and nine months for the college to be elevated to the status of a university. Indeed, the growth of the university means a continuing and growing commitment to academic excellence and quality, research, and productivity, community involvement, and partnership for national development and global competitiveness.

It is located on Holland Brook, originally named Amanmechunk, which means large creek in the Unami dialect. The area was inhabited by the Raritan prior to the arrival of European settlers. The Native Americans who lived near Readington Village travelled to the coast during the summer for fish and clams. Such a trip is mentioned in an Indian deed transferring lands around Holland Brook to English and Dutch settlers. The deed mentions two of the natives, who lived at Readington: Metamisco and Wataminian.Wittwer, Norman C. \\"The Dawn of Hunterdon\\" Readington was first settled by Europeans in the early 18th century by Dutch and English immigrants, including Emanuel Van Etta, from Esopus, New York, and Adrian Lane, an English settler who erected a mill on Holland Brook.History of Readington Township Nearby Van Etta Road is named for Emanuel Van Etta, whose surname means \\"from Etten\\". In 1738, the Dutch Reformed Church of North Branch was moved west to Readington Village because of the growing population. The third building on this site, pictured left, stands there today. A parsonage was built on the north side of the brook on the hill, still in Readington Township. The nearby Parsonage Hill Road in Branchburg is named for this site. The church location before the parish was moved to Readington was three miles east. This structure was a log building just north and west of the convergence of the North and South branches of the Raritan River formerly called Tucca-ramma-hacking by the Raritan, which meant the \\"flowing together of waters\\". The church's pastor, Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen later helped to form a seminary at the Old Dutch Parsonage in Somerville. This eventually became Queen's College, now known as Rutgers University.

He held the rare distinction of having two of his buildings listed within his lifetime. Life He was brought up in Lincoln, one of five children. His father was a senior partner in a firm of solicitors and later became clerk to Lindsey County Council. His mother was a lecturer at Bishop Grosseteste College, a teacher training college. A brother was Richard S. Scorer. He went to the independent Repton School in south Derbyshire, where he became head boy and excelled at drawing. He read Mechanical Sciences at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge in 1941, and enjoyed painting as well. He was commissioned in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and met his wife in Canada, when training to be a Fleet Air Arm pilot. He served as a fighter pilot until 1945 but was invalided out of service, having crashed while attempting to land on a moving aircraft carrier in the Baltic Sea. Combining his interest in artwork and mechanical design, he decided to become an architect.

Hyperbolic paraboloid structures Brayford Pool restaurants - formerly Lincolnshire Motor Company Showrooms Thin shell concrete roofs were invented in Germany around the 1920s, as a means of achieving large spans with limited materials and at low cost. The strength of the roof lies in its shape, and the way it carries the loads by the forces exerted in the planes of the shell, rather than by the weight of their materials. The first shell roofs were simple barrel vaults. The earliest is Wythenshawe Bus Garage, Manchester, built 1939-42. After the Second World War, the form was taken further. One of the first engineers to specialise in concrete shell techniques in Britain was the German refugee of Hungarian- Jewish origin, Dr K. Hajnal-K√≥nyi, who arrived in London in 1936, and who worked with Sam Scorer. Scorer became fascinated by the possibilities of shell roofs as a student, and designed a hyperbolic paraboloid roof in 1956 for a water tower in Ilkeston, Derbyshire. F√©lix Candela in Mexico was experimenting with ‚Äòanticlastic‚Äô or shells with double curvatures of opposing convexity and concavity, from which the hyperbolic paraboloid emerged. The form was particularly appropriate for developing countries because of its simple materials and low cost. The rationing of steel in the post-war period in Britain also was reason for the popularity of these designs. The 'hypar', as it is sometimes known, enjoyed a brief fashion, seen in buildings such as the Commonwealth Institute of 1960-2 and also the Wrexham swimming baths of 1964. Examples of Scorer's Work are: * Lincoln Motor Car Company Garage and Showrooms and later used as the headquarters of the Lincolnshire Library service.

Biography Before Dead P.A. Prior to forming Dead P.A. Jason Walsh and George Blitch performed in their own respective Houston based rock bands. Facing lineup problems in each of their projects Blitch joined Walsh's band, Backlash in 1995. After one performance together the band dissolved when Blitch \\"swiped\\" the bass player to form yet another band. Walsh promptly purchased a drum machine and sampler and began composing electronic dance music. For a short period during 1996 he was a member of the Houston-based electronic act Vertigo Blue. From 1997 to 2002 Walsh performed solo under the moniker Population Zero. As Population Zero, Walsh had three releases on compilations - two of which were later adapted and performed by DEAD P.A. The song \\"The Thief\\" was originally released on 1216records' \\"Emerge\\" compilation while the song \\"Nightlight\\" was released on WE Records \\"Please Rewind and Play Again vol. 4. History Jason Walsh and George Blitch began practicing as Dead P.A. in January 2003 and performed their first show on February 22, 2003 at a burlesque featuring Dita Von Teese. During 2003 and 2004 The television show Texas Live used Dead P.A. music and original score in its broadcast. The act obtained a unique live p.a. monthly residence at a club in downtown Houston and soon expanded to regional touring throughout the southeast. In July 2005, Levon Louis joined the act contributing to both song writing/production and live performance. Krystal Hardwick joined a year later adding female vocals to the mix.

A craniotomy was performed 10 days later but was largely unsuccessful in removing the tumor. The mass was determined to be an atypical Meningioma. Walsh underwent radiation treatments and chemotherapy upon recovering from the brain surgery. An actual picture from the MRI brain scan of the tumor is on the insert in the case under the CD of the album \\"The Dead Will Rise.\\" Touring live act The live performance always consists of core members Jason Walsh and George Blitch who are on occasion accompanied by contributing members and/or MC vocalists native to the town or region within which they are performing. Much like a club DJ set, Dead P.A. performs their music in a continuous mix. The sets often convey themes using lyrics, samples, costumes, theatrics, remixes, cover songs, and/or video. Blitch performs percussion on a Roland TD-10 electronic drumkit.

In 1999, NCAA Drug Committee published a list containing substances banned for the usage to student-athletes. Year after year it is updated and given to those students participating in college sports. If any student is caught taking any of the substances, they are subjected to suspension or even banned from participating in NCAA sports and possibly attending the university. The list is arranged into eight classes of drugs featuring examples of each drug (Note: There is no complete list of banned drug examples). Stimulants Stimulant is defined as an agent (as a drug) that temporarily increases the activity of an organism or any of its part. For athletes, stimulants are used for two major reasons: to heighten energy levels and to boast endurance. (Santella 59) Examples of stimulants are: amphetamine (Adderall), caffeine (guarana), cocaine, ephedrine, fenfluramine (Fen), methamphetamine, methylphenidate (Ritalin), phentermine (Phen), synephrine (bitter orange). Stimulants phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine aren't banned. The most common abused stimulant by athletes is amphetamine. Amphetamine Amphetamines are the largest group of stimulants. Amphetamine was first used in the 1930s as a drug to treat various medical conditions such as narcolepsy and depression. However, during World War II, amphetamine was given to soldiers to keep them awake and alert. Soon, it leads to athletes abusing it to gain an advance. Usage of stimulants, such as amphetamine, can lead to death. In 1960, Danish cyclist Kurt Enemar Jensen died from amphetamine use during the Summer Olympics, and British cyclist Tommy Simpson died during the 1967 Tour de France with alcohol and amphetamines in his system. Amphetamines manipulate the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Side effects Several side effects from abusing stimulants are insomnia, nervousness, agitation, psychosis, and if taken in high doses, hyperthermia, heat failure, and possibly death. Anabolic agents Anabolic agents, or Anabolic Androgenic Steroids (AAS), are any of a group of synthetic or natural steroid hormones that builds muscle by mimicking or increasing male-producing characteristics, such as testosterones. Anabolic agents are abused by athletes in training to increase the size and strength of their muscles. However, the muscle growth only occurs when combined with rigorous physical training. Examples of anabolic agents are boldenone, clenbuterol, dehydrocholormethyl-testosterone (DHEA), nandrolone, stanozolol, testosterone, methasterone, androstenedione, norandrostenedione, methandienone, etiocholanolone, and trenbolone. Boldenone Boldenone is an injectable anabolic steroid. It is only available legally at a veterinarian clinic, mostly for the treatment for horses. A popular brand for boldenone is Equipoise. Side effects Side effects with anabolic agents are very serious and are not to be ignored. Side effects include: acne, nervous tension, aggressiveness, cramping, headaches, dizziness, high blood pressure, testicular or scrotal pain, premature male baldness, deepening in voice, jaundice, and liver damage. Alcohol and beta blockers Alcohol, more precisely ethanol, is a colorless flammable liquid that is the intoxicating agent in fermented and distilled liquors. Beta blockers are any of a group of drugs that decrease the rate and force of heart contractions and lower high blood pressure. Beta blockers help athletes in sports such as rifle shooting or archery where nervousness can harm performance. Examples beta blockers are atenolol, metoprolol, nadolol, pindolol, propranolol, and timolol. Metoprolol Metoprolol is used to treat angina (chest pain) and hypertension. It is also used to treat or prevent heart attack. Brand names for beta blockers include Lopressor and Toprol-XL. Side effects Side effects of alcohol and beta blockers are dizziness, depression, diarrhea, rash, slow heartbeat, and/or impotence or loss of sexual drive... Diuretics and masking agents Diuretics, sometimes known as ‚Äòwater pills‚Äô, are drugs which draw excess fluid from the tissues of the body and convert it into urine. They are used for the swelling and bloating of premenstrual syndrome, for treating high blood pressure and, in older people, for heart failure caused by weakening of the heart's pumping mechanism. Diuretics are used to pass drug test because they increase the amount of urine produced by the body. By increasing the amount of urine, it dilutes any drugs in the urine, which makes it harder to identify drugs. Examples of diuretics and masking agents are: bumetanide, chlorothiazide, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, probenecid, spironolactone (canrenone), triameterene, and trichlormethiazide. Bumetanide Bumetanide is a loop diuretic (water pill) that prevents your body from absorbing too much salt, allowing the salt to instead be passed in your urine. It is used to treat fluid retention (edema) in people with congestive heart failure, liver disease, or a kidney disorder such as nephritic syndrome. A brand name for bumetanide is Bumex. Side effects Several side effects with diuretics and masking agents are: dizziness, dehydration, heat failure, and kidney failure. Street Drugs Street drugs are commonly abused drugs that are bought illegally in some places and legally in many others, and have many nicknames. Examples of street drugs are heroin, marijuana and its psychoactive ingredient of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and cocaine. Marijuana Marijuana, also known as cannabis, is a euphoriant and hallucinogenic drug prepared from the dried leaves of the strong-smelling plant Cannabis sativa. Marijuana is a commonly used drug, legal in many states. Side effects Side effects for street drugs vary. Yet side effects for marijuana are: psychological dependence requiring more of the drug to get the same effect, sleepiness, difficulty keeping track of time, impaired or reduced short-term memory, reduced ability to perform tasks requiring concentration and coordination, such as driving a car, increased heart rate, potential cardiac dangers for those with preexisting heart disease, bloodshot eyes, dry mouth and throat, decreased social inhibitions, paranoia, hallucinations, impaired or reduced short-term memory, impaired or reduced comprehension, altered motivation and cognition, making the acquisition of new information difficult, psychological dependence, impairments in learning and memory, perception, and judgment, anxiety or panic attacks. Peptide hormones and analogues Peptide hormones are water-soluble hormones composed of a few amino acids that introduce a series of chemical reactions to change the cell's metabolism. Examples of peptide hormones and analogues are: human growth hormone (hGH), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and erythropoietin (EPO). Human growth hormone (hGH) Human growth hormone is a naturally occurring hormone that is responsible for general body growth in both men and women. hGH helps the body protein while breaking down fat deposits. Too much hGH results in increased muscle mass. (Santella 45) Side effects Side effects for peptide hormones and analogues are acromegaly (overgrowth of hands, feet, and some facial features), enlarged organs, and cardiovascular problems. Anti- estrogens Anti-Estrogens are substances that block the effects of estrogen in the body (usually to prevent tumors) and are used by athletes to counter the side effects of steroids. Anti-estrogens are clinically used in the treatment of breast cancer and to reduce the breast cancer incidence in high- risk women. Examples of anti-estrogens are: anastrozole, clomiphene, tamoxifen, and formestane. Anastrozole Anastrozole, brand name Arimidex, is a type of anti-estrogen used in treatment of breast cancer but is also used by bodybuilders to combat the estrogenic side effects associated with using anabolic steroids. Side effects Side effects for anti-estrogens are :anxiety, back, bone, breast, joint, or pelvic pain, constipation, cough, diarrhea, dizziness, flu-like symptoms, (e.g., muscle aches, tiredness), headache, hot flashes, loss of appetite, nausea, sore throat, stomach pain or upset, sweating, tingling or burning sensation, trouble sleeping, vaginal dryness, vomiting, weakness, weight gain. Beta-2 agonists Beta-2 agonist is a drug that opens the bronchial airways and often helps build muscle. Agonist is often referred to as a drug that stimulates natural processes in the body and beta-2 to a cell receptor. They are clinically used to help asthma patients. Yet, the abuse of beta-3 agonists can be used as an enhancer. Examples of beta-2 agonists are: bambuterol, formoterol, salbutamol, and salmeterol. Bambuterol Bambuterol or Bambec is used in the control of breathing problems such as asthma, and especially nocturnal asthma. Side effects Side effects for beta-2 agonists are: muscle cramps, rapid heartbeats, nausea, headaches, and dizziness.

The village was suburbanised by the City of Mainz in 1969, and is now its smallest subdivision, with just over 3,000 permanent residents. Geography Drais is located atop a hill overlooking Mainz and the Rhine Valley. The village of Drais has maintained its historical boundaries, and is surrounded by apple, plum and strawberry orchards. Drais is surrounded by the larger more urban Mainz sub divisions of Finthen, Bretzenheim, Gonsenheim and . History The earliest traces of settlement in the current location of Drais dates back to around 850‚Äì450 BC. A permanent settlement would only come around the year 1000 AD with the clearing of the Ancient Olm Forest. Drais was officially recognized by King Conrad III of Germany on 24 August 1149 under the name 'Treise'. Throughout the Middle ages Drais belonged to the Archbishopric of Mainz under the direction of the office of Olm. During the Thirty Years' War, Drais as well as many other villages, towns and cities in the region suffered greatly. In 1620 Drais was sacked and plundered by the General Ambrogio Spinola during his campaign in the lower Palatinate. Several years later, as a result of the Battle of Breitenfeld Drais was occupied by Swedish forces from 1631 till 1635. In 1792 during the French Revolution, the French Revolutionary Army took over Mainz and the surrounding areas. With the support of 130 German towns and villages, the French proclaimed the founding of the independent Republic of Mainz. As this did not sit well with the Kingdom of Prussia which was seeking to maintain its control of trade on the Rhine River, Prussian troops were immediately dispatched to lay siege to Mainz. During the 18-week Siege, Prussian troops occupied Drais. On 23 July 1793 the French surrendered Mainz. After the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, the French retook the region with an army under the command of Napol√©on Bonaparte. During the occupation of France from 1797 till May 1814, Drais was governed by the newly formed French D√©partement of Mont Tonnerre. With the departure of the French, Mainz was assigned to the Grand Duchy of Hesse and became the capital of the province Rhenish Hesse (Rheinhessen). Drais remained as an independent village within Rheinhessen, and then later Rhineland- Palatinate until its suburbanisation on 8 June 1969 by the city Mainz. Today, Drais remains a traditional village within the city limits of Mainz. Places of interest  Jesuit cloister The former cloister of the Jesuit order of the Propstei Hirzenach was built in Drais in 1670. Since 1773 with the breakup of the order, the building has been transferred through various private ownerships. The site of the cloister currently includes a retirement community., see ¬ß \\"Unweit der Kirche...\\" Catholic church ‚ÄûMaria K√∂nigin‚Äú (Queen Mary) The Maria K√∂nigin Church was first erected in 1737 with the help of the local Jesuit community. The predecessor to the Maria K√∂nigin Church had been first erected in 1357 and had seen limited service since the 30 year's war due to extensive damage. The Catholic Church ‚ÄûMaria K√∂nigin‚Äú continues to hold regular services. Drais is united with Lerchenberg, and the eveyday service is almost in the Altenzentrum in Drais. On Sundays, there is a mass in Lerchenberg and one in Drais and is the main Catholic Church in Drais. Fruit markets Starting in late spring till early autumn, farms in and around Drais sell a portion of their harvest through local markets. Fruit at these markets include a variety of berries (including strawberries), cherries, apples and plums). Strawberries from Drais are well known to be among some of the best in the region due to Drais's geographical location. Mainz residents sometimes drive to Drais to buy fruit during the summer months. Throughout the year, farmers also place fruit and vegetables for sale on open racks within the village. Payment is made on \\"goodwill\\" as no one is there to collect the payment. Origins of the name The name Drais most likely has its origins from the Gothic word driusan, which translates to \\"bubbling sources\\".

Anne's mother had died in 1511. In 1514, Anne's father secured a place for her at the court of Archduchess Margaret of Savoy. While Anne was abroad, her father married Mary Tudor, the widowed Queen consort of Louis XII of France and the youngest sister of Henry VIII. Anne married firstly Edward Grey, 3rd Baron Grey of Powys in 1525.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Vol. 7, p. 356 (2004: Oxford University Press) Following the dissolution of the marriage, she created a scandal by living openly with her lover Randal Haworth, whom she later married. In 1540, her husband petitioned King Henry VIII's Privy Council, to punish Anne for adultery, accusing her and Haworth of having conspired to murder him. Nothing came of the allegations.  Family and early years  Lady Anne was born in about 1507, the eldest daughter of Charles Brandon, who would later, in 1514, be created Duke of Suffolk. Her mother was Anne Browne, her father's second wife. Before 1507, her father deserted Anne Browne, to whom he was betrothed and who was pregnant with Anne, in order to marry her maternal aunt Margaret Neville, a wealthy widow. When that marriage was declared null and void, he returned to Anne and married her as his second wife. The marriage also produced a younger daughter, Lady Mary Brandon. Years later, in 1528, Pope Clement VII issued a Papal Bull which confirmed that Brandon's divorce from Margaret Neville, who was still alive, was valid, thus establishing the legitimacy of Anne and her sister Mary. In 1514, Brandon arranged for Anne to be sent to the court of Archduchess Margaret of Savoy, Governor of the Netherlands. She was aged about seven years. While Anne was in the Netherlands, in 1515 her father married his third wife, Mary Tudor, the widowed Queen consort of King Louis XII of France, who was Henry VIII's youngest sister. Anne returned to England at her stepmother's insistence, although her father had intended her to stay at the court of Archduchess Margaret, saying to the latter \\"the Queen [Mary Tudor] has so urged and prayed me to have her that I cannot contradict her.\\"Hester Chapman, The Thistle and the Rose, p. 193. Two gentlemen escorted Anne from the Netherlands to Westhorpe Hall, where she and her younger sister, Mary, made their home with their father, stepmother and three remaining half-siblings: Henry Brandon, 1st Earl of Lincoln, Lady Frances Brandon, and Lady Eleanor Brandon. Their other half-sibling, also named Henry (b. 11 March 1516) had died in 1522. In June 1533, after the death of Mary Tudor, Anne and her sister Mary pushed themselves to the head of the funeral cortege just before the coffin was lowered into the crypt of the Abbey of St Edmundsbury, much to the consternation of their half-siblings.Chapman, p.212 Anne's father married his young ward Katherine Willoughby later that year. ‚ÄûOn Sunday next the duke of Suffolk will be married to the daughter of a Spanish lady named lady Willoughby.

When the affair came to light in 1552, the judge was arrested, but Anne Brandon went unpunished. By that time, her first husband had died, and she had married Randal Haworth.

In Waziristan he took part in a successful operation to recapture an enemy held picket and was subsequently awarded the Military Cross (MC). Second World War Lonsdale was promoted to the rank of lieutenant only a month before the outbreak of war. He occasionally held the rank of acting or temporary captain over the next few years before he volunteered for the Parachute Regiment in 1941. Like John Waddy he was a founding member of 151st Parachute Battalion of the Parachute Regiment in India, and remained with the battalion when it transferred to North Africa. In July 1943 he was transferred and made the commanding officer of A Company, 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment, part of the 1st Parachute Brigade.Frost, p. 171 Sicily In mid-1943, the 1st Airborne Division, to which the 1st Parachute Brigade was attached, was given the task of conducting three airborne assaults as part of Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. Each assault would be conducted by one of the division's brigades. The Ponte Grande road bridge south of Syracuse was to be captured by 1st Airlanding Brigade, the port of Augusta was to be seized by 2nd Parachute Brigade, and finally the Primasole Bridge over the River Simeto was to be taken and secured by 1st Parachute Brigade.Harclerode, p. 256 1st Parachute Brigade's plan for the capture of Primasole Bridge, code-named Operation Fustian, was quite simple: 1st Parachute Battalion would capture the bridge itself, 2nd Parachute Battalion would drop to the south of the bridge and prevent Axis forces from counter-attacking, and 3rd Parachute Battalion would do the same to the north.Thompson, p. 99 The 2nd Parachute Battalion was charged with securing three areas of high ground to the south of Primosole Bridge, codenamed Johnny I, II, and III. When the brigade was dropped around its objectives on the night of 13 July, Lonsdale and the majority of his company were amongst the few to be accurately dropped onto their zones, while the rest of the brigade were scattered over a large area.Thompson, p. 100 He was able to join Lieutenant Colonel John Frost and was confident that he could secure Johnny I with his own company.Frost, p. 179 Frost led a mixed force of about 100 men to \\"Johnny I\\" but on arrival there they discovered that a small force under Lieutenant Tony Frank, of A Company had not only captured the hill, but also taken 130 Italian prisoners. Lonsdale deployed his men on \\"Johnny I\\" and Frost, who had injured his knee in the drop, passed command of the objective to him.Frost, p.180 Lonsdale later led a small group of paratroopers towards \\"Johnny II\\" but came under fire from German troops and withdrew. For the next few hours the men on \\"Johnny I\\" were able to see German forces preparing to assault the battalion, but without any machine guns or mortars, they were unable to disrupt their preparations, or respond to the German's own mortar fire. Several attacks were launched, but all came from the same direction, and Lonsdale and his company were able to repel them.Thompson, p. 104 The grass on the top of \\"Johnny I\\" was soon set alight by German fire, and the battalion was forced to shrink its perimeter, although it was able to stop German attacks by mid-morning thanks to heavy naval fire from a British cruiser off the shore of Sicily.Thompson, pp. 104-105 By dusk 3rd Parachute Battalion to the north had been forced to retreat after suffering heavy casualties and facing repeated German assaults, and the surviving paratroopers began moving towards 2nd Parachute Battalion's positions; at the same time, Lonsdale managed to make contact with M4 Sherman tanks from 44th Royal Tank Regiment, part of the British 4th Armoured Brigade, who had advanced from the British beachheads. As the 3rd Parachute Battalion troops reached his company's positions, Lonsdale was instrumental in gathering them together and ensuring they did not retreat any further.Thompson, p. 106 The brigade was withdrawn from Primasole Bridge to Syracuse on the morning of 14 July, and from there back to North Africa.Thompson, p. 108 For his conduct during this operation, Lonsdale was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. His citation read: Battle of Arnhem Most of the 1st Airborne Division returned to the United Kingdom in November 1943 and were kept in reserve during Operation Overlord. In September Lonsdale was made second in command of 11th Battalion, Parachute RegimentThompson, p. 228 and in the same month the division was deployed in Operation Market Garden. The Allies planned to use airborne forces to secure key bridges over a number of rivers and canals in the Netherlands, opening a route around the Seigfried Line and into the heart of Germany.Thompson, p. 195 1st Airborne Division was tasked with securing bridges across the Lower Rhine at Arnhem, with the 4th Parachute Brigade planned to drop on the second day of the operation.Waddy, p42 The divisional commander, Major General Roy Urquhart, had an original plan which envisaged the 4th Parachute Brigade advancing to the north of Arnhem, but by the end of day one the allied advance into Arnhem had stalled. Only a small group of the 1st Parachute Brigade, mainly elements of Lieutenant Colonel John Frost's 2nd Battalion, were able to reach the bridge.Waddy, p. 65 The 1st and 3rd battalions were unable to penetrate the outer suburbs of the city and their advance stalled, so in order to support them elements of the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment, glider infantry of the 1st Airlanding Brigade, were sent forward on the morning of 18 September.Waddy, p. 79 When the second lift arrived later that day the remaining companies of the South Staffords and the 11th Battalion were sent forward and arrived at the outskirts of Arnhem that night.Middlebrook, p. 188 Lonsdale did not advance with the battalion however. The C-47 Dakota in which Lonsdale was travelling was hit by German anti-aircraft fire, damaging it and also wounding Londsdale in his right hand; he was delayed in exiting the aircraft when the two men either side of him refused to jump, which meant they had to be unhooked before he and the rest of his stick could jump out of the aircraft. Upon landing, Lonsdale found that his wound was bleeding considerably, and his orderly had to bandage up his hand.Saunders, p. 244 =Lonsdale Force= In the early hours of the morning of 19 September, an attack was launched on a narrow front between the river and the railway line, in order to force a passage through to the bridge.Middlebrook, p. 191 However, in the face of strong enemy positions and armour, the attack faltered and the British routed.Middlebrook, p. 216 The remnants of the four battalions fell back in disarray to the main divisional positions at Oosterbeek. Here they were met by Lieutenant Colonel Sheriff Thompson, CO of 1st Airlanding Light Regiment, who drove a little over half a mile forward of his own 75 Millimetre Howitzers positions at Oosterbeek Church, and ordered Major Robert Cain to gather the men into defensive units.Middlebrook, p. 326 Thompson asked Brigadier Philip Hicks for more men and officers, and was sent Lonsdale and Major Simmons. While Simmons organised defences at the church, Thompson sent Lonsdale forward to take charge of the outlying force.Middlebrook, p. 327 This sector was officially designated Thompson Force in a divisional meeting the following day. On 20 September, the Germans launched a series of increasingly heavy attacks against Lonsdale's men. Although in an isolated position they held their ground throughout the day and Lance Sergeant John Baskeyfield was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on the main road into Oosterbeek.Waddy, p. 134 By the afternoon the mixed force was so weakened that Hicks gave Thompson permission to pull them back to the main divisional defence line at the church.Middlebrook, p. 335 German flamethrowers and tank fire had set fire to buildings and the surrounding woodland and the British withdrew under intense fire.Waddy, p. 135Thompson, p. 239 Lonsdale ordered the men who had fallen back to gather and rest in the church, and it was here that he gave a speech to rouse his exhausted and dispirited men. Standing with a sling around his injured arm, a blood-stained bandage covering his three head wounds and a bandage on his leg, Lonsdale climbed into the pulpit: Although many of the men were asleep, the speech put new strength and hope into the men who heard it.Waddy, p. 136Middlebrook, p.336Ryan, p. 471 Lonsdale took command of the parachute battalions in the sector, while Thompson took charge of the artillery, South Staffords and Glider Pilots. However, on 21 September Thompson was injured by mortar fire and Lonsdale took overall command of the sector, which was renamed Lonsdale Force. For several days they fought off determined German attacks in their sector, usually minor infantry encounters.Middlebrook, p. 358 On many mornings Royal Artillery units from XXX Corps, south of the river, laid barrages just forward of the force's positions to disrupt any enemy buildups, on one occasion accidentally shelling their own men.Midllebrook, p. 377 On the morning of Monday 25 September, Urquhart agreed to withdraw his division south of the river, but he would have to wait until nightfall.Middlebrook, p.423 It was on this day that the Germans made their most significant gains, breaking through the British perimeter at the northern end of Lonsdale Force's sector and sweeping south to the South Staffords positions. The German forces succeeded in overrunning several artillery positions before being forced back.Middlebrook, p.425 The 1st Airborne withdrew that night, although Lonsdale force were amongst the last to fall back to the river after waiting for the units further north to fall back past them. Nevertheless, they were at the back of the queues to cross the river and many men were left behind.Middlebrook, p. 432 Lonsdale saw as many men over as possible before he left. No boats were running by the time he came to leave and so he swam the river, a task made more difficult by his injuries. For his conduct during the battle, Lonsdale was awarded a Bar to the DSO on 9 November 1944. His citation read: In 1945 several hundred survivors from the battle had the opportunity to take part in the film Theirs is the Glory, recounting the events at Arnhem. Lonsdale portrayed himself in the film, and once again delivered his rousing speech in the church. Later life Lonsdales's grave in Aldershot Military Cemetery Lonsdale later commanded an almagated force of the 3rd and 11th Parachute battalions and saw service in Palestine, being promoted to lieutenant colonel. In 1946 he transferred from the Parachute Regiment and served with the King's African Rifles for a time in Uganda, and then left the British Army. He remained in Africa for several years, entering the wine trade, and then returned to the United Kingdom living in Jersey, the Isle of Man and Bath. He died on 23 November 1988, at the age of 74. He is buried in Aldershot Military Cemetery.

It is mandated to provide advance institutions in arts, agricultural and natural sciences as well as in technological and professional fields.Philippine Presidential Decree No. 2017 Section 2 Its main campus is located in Tabuk, Kalinga. It was first established in the 1970s under the name Kalinga Community College. History By mandate of DECS Order No. 15, series of 1971, authorizing the operation of government-supported community colleges in the country, the Provincial Board of Kalinga-Apayao, led by Gov. Rolando T. Puzon passed Resolution No. 97, series of 1974, establishing the Kalinga- Apayao State College of Trades and Industries KCCTI which offered purely vocational courses in poultry, piggery, garments, trades and native loom weaving, was then inaugurated with Mr. Augusto Alejandrino as the first Administrator. Subsequently, the Municipal Council of Tabuk passed Resolution No. 8 authorizing KCCTI to use the Municipal Plaza Reservation, Lot No. 1416 for the putting up of its physical plant with authority to remain in force as long as the college exists. After securing a government permit, the school opened a two-year Midwifery course. Fortunately, from its first graduates of 45 Midwives, 30 took the Board Examination of which 100% passed. In 1978, the College Administrator successfully worked out the offering of Liberal Arts, Commerce, Education, and Secretarial Courses. Because of this significant development, the Provincial Governor, Hon. Amado B. Almazan, suggested a change of the name of the college from Kalinga Community College of Trades and Industries to Kalinga Community College. On January 26, 1986, the Kalinga- Apayao State College was created under P.D. 2017 mandating the merging of the Kalinga Community College, the Dona Eufronia Molina Puzon Memorial High School, and the Tabuk National High School. The BIBAK NAS. Nevertheless, due to some technicalities, it was only made operational on October 7, 1992. That time the Board of Trustees had its first organizational meeting held at the Office of the Undersecretary of the DECS, University of Life Complex. Pasig, Metro Manila. The meeting was prescribed over by Hon. Luis Baltazar, DECS Undersecretary and was attended by hon. Joseph Albanza, NEDA-CAR Regional Director, Stephen N. Capuyan, DECS-CAR Regional Director, and Mr. Norfredo M. Dulay was designated as the first Board Secretary. Consequently, the tertiary program of the BIBAK National Agricultural School was integrated with the State College under Memorandum of Agreement entered into and between of the Officer-In-charge of the DECS in January 1993. On July 7, 1993, the President of the Republic of the Philippines, His Excellency Fidel V. Ramos appointed Dr. Francisco M. Basuel as the first President of the Kalinga-Apayao State College. He assumed office on August 2, 1993. Within the term of Dr. Basuel from 1993 to 1997, the State College had undertaken certain significant developments. The additional undergraduate programs were B.S. in Agriculture, B.S. in Agricultural Engineering, B.S. in forestry, B.S. in Environmental Studies, B.S. Development Communication, B.S. in Entrepreneurship, and Forest Ranger Certificate. Other short-term vocational courses and training programs were offered aside from the existing academic programs. The graduate school program of KASC was also approved offering graduate degree programs such as Master of Science in Rural Development, Doctor of Philosophy in Development Education, and Doctor of Philosophy in Community Development and Master of Arts in Education. The needed infrastructure projects were also completed with a budget of P18.9 Million. KASC also acquired for free, 44 hectares of the provincial government reservation where the main campus is now situated. Other land acquisitions for the educational needs of KASC were the 400 hectares of land located at Rizal, Kalinga from the DENR for purposes of research, extension, and production projects. Linkages with a good number of regional and national government agencies were established to provide financial assistance and technical support to the State College. Moreover, KASC as a member-institution of the PASUC-CAR assumed its development role in CAR with watershed Development as its Center of Excellence. In order to enhance its instructional capability, the State College implemented a Faculty and Staff Development Program to upgrade the quality of instruction and the educational qualification of each academic personnel. A good number of deserving faculty members were sent for study leave and have completed their graduate courses. Dr. Basuel‚Äôs term ended in 1997. On November 2, 1997, Dr. Venus I. Lammawin was elected by the Board of Trustees as the second president of the Kalinga- Apayao State College. Under Dr. Venus I. Lammawin the infrastructure projects, which were started by her predecessor were completed. The Academic Laboratory Buildings, Administrative Building and Library Building, road networks were completed in due time. Personnel and Staff Development became more extensive sending faculty and staff for graduate studies on Saturdays and Sundays aside from those who were given full-time study leave. Enrollment undertook steep increase requiring additional faculty members. There was an increase in library holdings. Under the leadership of Lammawin, the College facilities were upgraded ensuring quality services to its clientele .One frontline service was established which is the computerization of the Registrar‚Äôs Office, Cashiering and Payroll sections. Graduating students were also given the chance to avail the CHED-funded Student‚Äôs Loan Program.

It explains the test of \\"reasonable grounds for belief\\" under the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1), and raises the issue of the reasonableness test under s 3. Facts Ogden Ltd wanted to hire some barges in order to dump excavated clay at sea. Mr O‚ÄôLoughlin, Howard Marine Ltd‚Äôs employee, told Mr Redpath, Ogden Ltd‚Äôs employee that their German built barges could carry 1600 tonnes (deadweight, rather than cubic capacity). This was based on the Lloyd‚Äôs Register for barges. Unfortunately and unusually the Lloyd's Register was incorrect. The true capacity was 1055 tonnes. Mr O‚ÄôLoughlin was aware that the German shipping documents stated the correct figure of 1055 tonnes. But he preferred the Lloyd‚Äôs Register. The charterparties (a contract for the hire of a ship) said Ogden Ltd‚Äôs acceptance of the barges showed they were in every way satisfied. When the barges proved to be insufficient for the job, Ogden Ltd refused to pay the full price. Howard Marine Ltd terminated the agreement and sued for the outstanding payments. Ogden Ltd counterclaimed for, *breach of collateral warranty *breach of duty under s 2(1) MA 1967 *negligent misstatement under Hedley Byrne Howard Marine Ltd argued they had reasonable grounds to believe their false statement, because the Lloyd's Register was the ‚Äòbible‚Äô. Judgement The Court of Appeal (Lord Denning MR, Bridge LJ and Shaw LJ) all held there was no breach of warranty, but decided by a majority that Howard Marine Ltd was liable for breach of duty under MA 1967 s 2(1). It was not necessary, therefore, to decide the Hedley Byrne point, but each judge said something different. Under MA 1967 s 2(1) Bridge LJ noted Howard Marine Ltd had to prove a reasonable ground to believe what he said about the barge‚Äôs capacity. Bridge LJ said Mr O‚ÄôLoughlin was always honest, but his eagerness to prefer the Register over the documents was not reasonable. They held liability had not been validly excluded, because in agreement with the judge he felt that it did not pass the reasonableness test under MA 1967 s 3. Shaw LJ agreed. Lord Denning MR dissented saying that there were reasonable grounds to prefer the Lloyd‚Äôs Register. He also argued that the exclusion clause was valid, and was reasonable.

The history further speaks of the extraordinary and unwavering contributions of its early pioneers that led to the unprecedented and progressive metamorphosis of the University. Today, IFSU continues to flourish and contributes in shaping and improving the socio-economic, cultural and political landscape of the province. The early beginnings In 1920, IFSU started as Nayon Settlement Farm School (NSFS) by American Educators offering general elementary instruction while engaging in agriculture projects particularly vegetable, poultry, and swine production. It closed at the outbreak of World War II and reopened after liberation maintaining its offerings. The substantial success made in these agricultural projects must have provided the ideas for Filipino education officials who took over the leadership of the local education system. Mr. Felix U. Brawner, Sr., District Supervisor of Kiangan (where Lamut was part), together with then Principal Raymundo de Leon conceived a type of instruction based on basic agriculture, for the Nayon Elementary School. Even when Mr. Brawner was promoted as the Assistant Superintendent for Baguio ‚Äì Mt. Province Division and Mr. de Leon took over as District Supervisor, the duo continued to crystallize the plan. Soon, they submitted a proposal for the elevation of the institution to Congressman Luis Hora, Representative of the defunct Third District of Mt. Province which included Ifugao. The late Congressman Hora was enthusiastic with the proposal, discussed it with colleagues and higher education officials, and filed a bill in congress. It was approved sometime in 1959 as Republic Act (R.A.) 2432 elevating in the school into the Ifugao Pilot Opportunity School of Agriculture (IPOSA). The IPOSA, with unique offering exclusively on the rudiments of agricultural skill to out of school youths and adults, started in March 1961. Mr. Pedro D. Indunan, then newly appointed Benguet Ifugao Apayao Kalinga Division Supervisor, together with General Education Supervisors from the Division for non-formal education assisted the implementation of the programs. Tasked to pioneer the leadership of the new type of school was Mr. Saturnino C. Cauton. With him were five school farm demonstrators and five administrative staffs, Mr. Cauton headed the school until the end of 1966. He was succeeded by Mr. Albert B. Dimas in January 1967. In recognition to the ownership of the site pf the institution, Congressman Luis Hora filed another Legislative Act renaming the school into Payon Bugan Pilot Opportunity School of Agriculture (PBPOSA) in honor of Bugan, the original owner and donor of the land where the main campus of IFSU now stands. With Administrator Dimas, the school continued to grow especially with the offering of the regular vocational agriculture and homemaking courses. Hon. Romulo B. Lumauig, the first elected congressman of the new province of Ifugao, saw it fit that the school offers college courses and so he worked for the passage of R.A. 6453. The law that converted PBPOSA into Ifugao Agricultural and Technical College (IATC) which produces the first batch of graduates from two-year technical courses in agriculture and homemaking in 1975 and first batch of graduates from the degree courses in Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (BSA) and Bachelor of Science in Home Techcnology (BSHT) in 1977. During the Interim Batasan Pambansa, Assemblyman Gualberto B. Lumauig capped the steady upward metamorphosis of the institution with the Parliamentary Bill No. 1326 which was approved by then President Ferdinand E. Marcos in March 1982 as Batas Pambansa (BP) Blg. 189. It upgraded the IATC into the Ifugao State College of Agriculture and Forestry (ISCAF) integrating with it the former Potia National Agricultural School in Potia; and the Barangay Schools at Amduntog, Kiangan; Hacmal, Aguinaldo; Hapao, Hingduan and Impugong, Tinoc. Thereupon, the autonomous chartered state college started its implementation in January 1983 with Superintendent Albert B. Dimas as Officer-In-Charge (OIC) Administrator. The Birth of ISCAF In December 1985, Dr. Toribio B. Adaci was appointed as the Second College President, With Dr. Adaci, the College grew even higher with the offering of several degree and Master's Program. By virtue of R.A. 7722, otherwise known as the Higher Education Modernization Act of 1994, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) were separated from the Basic Education (Elementary and High School) and were subjected to the supervision of the Commission of Higher Education (CHED) while the latter with Department of Education (DepEd). R.A. 8292 authorized the integration of CHED Supervised Institutions (CSIs) to existing State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) in the respective provinces. Thus, the Ifugao College of Arts and Trades (ICAT) at Lagawe was integrated to ISCAF in the year 1999 covered under Board Resolution No. 645. In February 2002, Dr. Adaci retired and the college was placed under interim management pending the search and election of a new president. Dr. Marcelo M. Roguel, President of the Nueva Vizcaya State Institute of Technology (NVSIT), was appointed as the Officer-In-Charge (OIC) President in concurrent capacity. He moved to organize various academic units into Institutes and pushed for the accreditation of academic programs. The beginning of new era On February 21, 2003, a new era was ushered in by the unanimous election of the Second College President, Dr. Serafin L. Ngohayon. Dr. Ngohayon recognized the urgent need for a comprehensive development plan and worked for the immediate crafting, approval and implementation of the ISCAF 8- Year Development Plan 2003‚Äì2011. The vision to transform ISCAF into a University was born and was vigorously pursued. The College develops in all fronts, i.e. more courses were opened all the way to the doctoral level (Ph.D.), curricular programs were standardized and accredited, systems were computerized, needed facilities improved, researches doubled, extension programs multiplied and income generating projects put up. All of these helped ISCAF from being a SUC level I to SUC Level III status in 2007. Recognizing the readiness of ISCAF and the clamor for higher education institution in the province with a broader scope of operation and expansive course offerings, Congressman Solomon R. Chungalao of the Lone District of Ifugao, filed House Bill (HB) No. 926 seeking to convert ISCAF into Ifugao State University (IFSU). The bill was later substituted as HB No. 4409 with other Congressmen as co-sponsors. It was passed in the House of Representatives on September 16, 2008 and immediately transmitted to the Philippine Senate. Meanwhile, the move to convert ISCAF into a university gained support in the Philippine Senate with counterpart bills filed by Senator Aquilino Q. Pimentel (SB 1224) and Senator Manny A. Villar (SB 2658), respectively. Along with HB 4409, deliberations on the senate counterpart measures started on September 17, 2008 highlighted by a public hearing done on April 24, 2009 and its successful passage in the senate floor for Second reading on July 27, 2009. With the full support of the Senators and the Senate Leadership (Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile, Majority Floor leader Juan Miguel F. Zubiri, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance Edgardo J. Angara) the consolidated HB 4409 under committee report 536 was passed on third and final reading on August 18, 2009. Thereafter, it was sent back to the House of Representatives for concurrence and subsequent signature of Speaker Prospero C. Nograles. It was returned to the senate for the signature of Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile who formally transmitted it to Malaca√±ang on September 17, 2009. The legislative task of transforming ISCAF into a University was completed on October 14, 2009 with the signing of Republic Act No. 9720 by her Excellency, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo into law entitled ‚ÄúAn act Converting the Ifugao State College of Agriculture and Forestry And All Its Existing Campuses Located in the Province of Ifugao Into A University To Be Known As The Ifugao State University And Appropriating Funds Thereof‚Äù. Formal operation of the Ifugao State University started on January 6, 2010 with the official launching of the university status marked by the approval and adoption of the IFSU Code and the 5Year 2010‚Äì2014 Development Plan. By virtue of Section 9 of R.A. 9720, Dr. Serafin L. Ngohayon was the First University President. He was officially appointed and sworn into office on December 14, 2009. Under Dr. Ngohayon's exemplary leadership from 2003 to June 1, 2018, he steered a new era of IFSU. Election of the Second University President In 2018, another historic event unfolded. The Board of Regents elected the First woman and Second IFSU President, Dr. Eva Marie Codamon- Dugyon. By virtue of BOR Resolution No. 744 series of 2018, Dr. Dugyon was appointed as the new President of IFSU effective June 2, 2018 to June 1, 2022. During her first months, Dr. Dugyon convened the IFSU officials and stakeholders and crafted the 8-Year Development Plan (2018‚Äì2026). The 8-Year Strategic Plan outlined the new vision, mission and goals of the University. Aside from this, a new organizational structure was approved by the BOR. Currently, IFSU has six campuses, namely: Lamut (Main); Lagawe; Hapao; Potia; Aguinaldo and Tinoc. Location The Ifugao State University is the only tertiary educational institution in the province of Ifugao. It is in Northern Luzon, Philippines in the southeastern portion of Ifugao province. The main campus is at Barangay Nayon, Municipality of Lamut, about 300 kilometers from Manila, the capital city of the Philippines. Potia Campus at Alfonso Lista, Ifugao is about 72 kilometers from Santiago City; Lagawe Campus is nestled at Bahawit, Lagawe, the capital town of Ifugao; and Tinoc Campus lies at the western part of Ifugao, about 14 kilometers from Mt.

A barrel cellar of a Gevrey-Chambertin wine producer. Gevrey-Chambertin wine is produced in the communes of Gevrey- Chambertin and Brochon in the C√¥te de Nuits subregion of Burgundy. The Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) Gevrey-Chambertin may be used only for red wine with Pinot noir as the main grape variety. There are nine Grand Cru vineyards within the commune of Gevrey-Chambertin, Chambertin and eight others called Chambertin in combination with something else, such as Chapelle- Chambertin. While Gevrey-Chambertin also has several highly regarded Premier Cru vineyards, it has a particularly large amount of vineyards at the village level for a C√¥te de Nuits appellation. This is because the vineyards of the AOC stretch further to the east (beyond the N74 road) than in most neighbouring AOCs. Wine style Gevrey-Chambertin wines are highly colourful and potent for Burgundies, with intense aromas and flavours evoking blackcurrant, cherry, musk and liquorice, among others. The potency of Gevrey- Chambertin wines makes it a suitable accompaniment to stews and strong- flavoured cooking, such as grilled red meat, leg of mutton, beef Bourguignon, rabbit stew, coq au vin, coq au Chambertin, and strong cheeses, such as √âpoisses. Production A village-level Burgundy wine from Gevrey-Chambertin. In 2008, of vineyard surface was in production for Gevrey-Chambertin at village and Premier Cru level, making it the largest village-named appellation of the C√¥te de Nuits, and the second largest of the C√¥te d'Or, just behind Beaune AOC. In the same year, 17,282 hectoliter of red wine was produced, corresponding to just over 2.3 million bottles. AOC regulations The AOC regulations allow up to 15 per cent total of Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris as accessory grapes in the red wines, but this is not practiced very often. The allowed base yield is 40 hectoliter per hectare, and the grapes must reach a maturity of at least 10.5 per cent potential alcohol for village- level wine and 11.0 per cent for Premier Cru wine. Premiers Crus The 26 climats in Gevrey-Chambertin listed below are classified as Premier Cru vineyards. Some of the Premier Cru vineyards are located around the group of Grand Cru vineyards, south of the village, while some are located together on a slope to the northwest of the village. Their wines are designated Gevrey- Chambertin Premier Cru + vineyard name, or as just Gevrey-Chambertin Premier Cru, in which case it is possible to blend wine from several Premier Cru vineyards within the AOC. In 2007, of the total Gevrey-Chambertin vineyard surface consisted of Premier Cru vineyards.

It is mandated to provide higher professional, technical and special instructions for special purposes and promote research and extension services, advanced studies and progressive leadership in agriculture, education, forestry, engineering, arts, sciences, humanities, and other fields.Philippine Republic Act No. 7182 Section 2 Its main campus is in Bontoc, Mountain Province. History The first idea of having a college in Mountain Province is credited to Alfredo Belingon who was then the social studies supervisor in the BIAK (Bontoc, Ifugao, Apayao-Kalinga) Division and who subsequently retired as schools division superintendent of Kalinga-Apayao. He started working for the establishment of the Mountain Province Community College and nursed it for two or more years before he was appointed Assistant Superintendent of Kalinga-Apayao. Dr. Allyson Belagan took over as officer-in- charge of the college for one year before handing it over to his full-time successor. In 1973, John ‚ÄúKodoo‚Äù Daoas was pulled from the Eastern Philippine Colleges to run the new college. Bringing in his experiences as a professor and administrator of a tertiary institution, he harnessed whatever resources there were and continued the programs of his predecessor. In 1992, four degree programs were offered: Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education, Bachelor of Science in Commerce, Bachelor of Science in Accountancy, and Bachelor of Arts. Two non-degree programs which were Midwifery and Junior Secretarial were also offered. Governance of the Mountain Province Community College was in the hands of a Board of Directors headed by the Provincial Governor. The first chairman of the Board of Directors was Gov. Jaime K. Gomez. Besides its policy formulation function, the Board of Directors was tasked to secure funding support for the college. The Community College, however, drew its main operating expenses from the fees paid by the students which were far from sufficient to meet the needs of the college. This deplorable financial status of the college challenged individuals to work for its conversion into a state college. As early as 1975, then regional director Telesforo Boquiren and his assistant regional director Bernardo M. Reyes started discussing the possibility of establishing a state college in Mountain Province. Proposals were written and submitted to then Education Secretary Juan Manuel but without positive result. The efforts to open such a state college were mainly through the administrative route of the Ministry of Education and Culture. There was no political support outside the province to re-enforce the efforts of the Department of Education in its quest for the establishment of a state college. In 1978, the first election for the national assembly or Batasang Pambansa was held, and Hon. Victor S. Dominguez was elected as one of the assemblymen, representing Region I. He was about to file a bill for the creation of Mountain Province State College but was overtaken by a moratorium imposed against the establishment of additional state colleges. With the moratorium, the drive to open a state college in Mountain Province was temporarily withheld. After the reorganization of the Congress of the Philippines in 1987, Dominguez was re-elected, and one of his priorities was the establishment of a state college in Mountain Province. The first House Bill (HB No. 00180) was filed on August 6, 1987. Unfortunately, the same did not prosper during that year. On May 28, 1991, Honorable Dominguez filed another bill titled ‚Äú An Act converting the Mountain Province Community College to be known as the Mountain Province State Polytechnic College, Integrating therewith the Tadian School of Arts and Trades in the Municipality of Tadian; the Bacarri Agricultural High School in the Municipality of Paracelis; and the Eastern Bontoc National Agricultural School in the Municipality of Barlig, all in Mountain Province, and Appropriating Funds thereof ‚Äù. This bill was approved on First Reading on June 3, 1991, Second Reading on August 15, 1991, and third Reading on September 4, 1991, and was acted upon by the President of the Republic of the Philippines Cory C. Aquino on January 17, 1992, which finally became Republic Act No. 7182.Philippine Republic Act No. 7182 Section 1 With the enactment of R.A. 7182, the dream of establishing a state college in Mountain Province was finally realized. This marked a significant event in the history of MPSPC. This law defines the identity of the institution as a government corporation and spells out its vision and mission. As a corporation, the institution is governed by a Board of Trustees which is the law-making body of the Polytechnic. The Board formulates policies which guide the college in the realization of its vision and accomplishment of its mission. These policies are made to meet the peculiar needs of the Polytechnic which are not needed in other institutions or agencies. The Governing Board also sees to it that decisions and actions of the president of the Polytechnic are made in accordance to the policies it has passed and other directives issued by proper authorities. Thus, the Board has to confirm major decisions made by the College President. With the enactment of R.A. 7182, Dr. Marcelino T. Delson was appointed as the first college president who assumed office, from 1992 to July 2004. He was succeeded by NEDA-CAR director Juan B. Ngalob, who served as OIC-president from August 2004 to March 2005. In April 2005, Dr. Nieves A. Dacyon took over the administration after having been elected college president in February 2005 and appointed into office on March 31, 2005. During the incumbency of the then president Fidel V. Ramos, Hon. Dominguez made representation at Malacanang to source funds for the establishment of the Bauko Campus. He donated his titled lot to establish a main campus with standard and complete facilities that would have made MPSPC the center of tertiary education in the Cordillera. Unfortunately, however, this plan did not fully materialize except for the construction of an administration building and one academic building.

In June, 2005, the campus also absorbed the College of Forestry which was opened in Mount Data, Bauko, Mountain Province in 1995 but was unable to sustain sufficient enrollees, hence the transfer to Tadian Campus for better management took place in June, 2006.

Such problem is still being worked out with concerned agencies. Student population Starting with 15 undergraduate curricular offerings with 720 enrollees in 1992, the college now offers 23 undergraduate and six graduate programs with an average enrolment of about 5,000 students per semester.

He was born at Darlington Point, Waddai, New South Wales, and worked as a shearer, labourer and mailman in the west of the State. His first political involvements were as an organiser of shearers for the Australian Workers' Union and then secretary of a local branch of the Australian Labor Party. From 1933 he lived at Dubbo with his wife and 12 children. While he had lived outside of the system of \\"protection\\" of Aboriginal people, he was well aware of the conditions under which other Aboriginal people lived. From 1936, when parliament amended the Aborigines Protection Act 1909 to increase its powers to govern Aboriginal people's lives, he began speaking and lobbying for civil rights. He launched the Aborigines Progressive Association (APA) at Dubbo in 1937 and was a witness before the Legislative Assembly's select committee on the administration of the Aborigines Protection Act (which failed to initiate any reform). With William Cooper and John Patten, he organised a Day of Mourning for Aboriginal people on Australia Day 1938. Aborigines Claim Citizen Rights! was the pamphlet that he wrote with Patten to promote their cause. He organised five APA conferences in country towns from 1938. He also was elected a member of the Aborigines Welfare Board, after the government responded to APA criticism by deciding to have two Aboriginal people on the board. While on the board he was shocked by the complaints received about conditions in Aboriginal reserves, and attempted to force some changes. In 1949 he went to lobby the national Chifley Labor government in Canberra as a representative of the Australian Aborigines' League, asking for many administrative reforms, which he had drafted. The Minister for the interior, Herbert Johnson, was unresponsive. Ferguson was furious, resigned from the Labor party, and stood as an Independent candidate for Parliament in his electorate of Lawson, but drew only a small number of votes. He collapsed after a final speech, and died of hypertensive heart failure on 4 January 1950 in Dubbo Base Hospital.

AT&T; SportsNet Rocky Mountain is available on cable providers and live stream website on Stadium throughout Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Wyoming, Montana, Southern Idaho, northern New Mexico, western Kansas, western Nebraska, western South Dakota, parts of California, including all of San Bernardino County and Mohave County, Arizona; it is also available nationwide on satellite via DirecTV and Dish Network.http://rockymountain- attsn.att.com/2017/09/08/att-sportsnet-to-be-available-on-directv-u-verse-and- centurylink-in-las-vegas-and-surrounding-areas/ History AT&T; SportsNet Rocky Mountain was originally launched in November 1988 as the Prime Sports Network, a joint venture between Bill Daniels and Tele-Communications Inc. The channel was one of the original members of the Prime Network, a group of regional sports networks with the Los Angeles-based Prime Ticket (now Fox Sports West) as its flagship outlet. The network was later renamed Prime Sports Rocky Mountain in 1990. In October 1995, News Corporation, which formed a sports division for the Fox network two years earlier after it obtained the broadcast rights to the National Football Conference and sought to create a group of regional sports networks, acquired a 50% interest in the Prime Network from TCI parent Liberty Media. Later that year on November 1, News Corporation and Liberty Media relaunched the Prime Network affiliates as part of the new Fox Sports Net group, with the Denver-based network officially rebranding as Fox Sports Rocky Mountain. The channel was rebranded as Fox Sports Net Rocky Mountain in 2000, as part of a collective brand modification of the FSN networks under the \\"Fox Sports Net\\" banner; subsequently in 2004, the channel shortened its name to FSN Rocky Mountain, through the networks' de-emphasis of the \\"Fox Sports Net\\" brand. On December 22, 2006, News Corporation sold its interest in FSN Rocky Mountain and sister networks FSN Utah, FSN Northwest and FSN Pittsburgh to Liberty Media, in an asset trade in which News Corporation also traded its 38.5% ownership stake in satellite provider DirecTV for $550 million in cash and stock, in exchange for Liberty Media's 16.3% stake in the company. On May 4, 2009, DirecTV Group Inc. announced it would become a part of Liberty's entertainment unit, part of which would then be spun off into the separate company under the DirecTV name, in a deal in which Liberty would increase its share in DirecTV from 48% to 54%, with Liberty owner John Malone and his family owning a 24% interest. DirecTV would operate its newly acquired FSN-affiliated networks through DirecTV Sports Networks, a new division formed when the split off from Liberty Media was completed on November 19, 2009. On December 17, 2010, DirecTV Sports Networks announced that its four Fox Sports Networks-affiliated regional outlets ‚Äì FSN Rocky Mountain, FSN Pittsburgh, FSN Northwest and FSN Utah ‚Äì would be relaunched under the \\"Root Sports\\" brand. The network officially rebranded as Root Sports Rocky Mountain on April 1, 2011, with The Dan Patrick Show as the first program to air under the new brand. For nominal purposes, the Root Sports networks continued to carry programming distributed mainly to the Fox Sports regional networks to provide supplementary sports and entertainment programming. On June 12, 2017, AT&T; Sports Networks announced that the network, along with Root Sports Southwest, Root Sports Pittsburgh, and Root Sports Utah, will rebrand under the name AT&T; SportsNet Rocky Mountain, with all network programming and on-air talent remaining intact. The name change took effect on July 14, 2017. Programming Professional sports AT&T; SportsNet Rocky Mountain holds the regional cable television rights to MLB's Colorado Rockies, the NBA's Utah Jazz, the NHL's Vegas Golden Knights, WNBA‚Äôs Las Vegas Aces, and Major League Rugby's Glendale Raptors and Utah Warriors. The network airs pregame and postgame shows before and after all Rockies, Jazz, and Golden Knights games that it produces, as well as postgame shows for additional Golden Knights games that it does not televise. Additionally, the station produces and airs several Rockies insider programs, including The Club: Colorado Rockies, Rockies Double Play, and Rockies Real Time, and one Golden Knights insider program, Knight Life. Currently, the network does not air any ancillary shows for any of their other professional sports programming (other than the Jazz pregame and postgame shows), with some rare exceptions, including a 2018 documentary titled Hot Rod: The Untold Story of Hot Rod Hundley, that chronicled the life and career of the former Utah Jazz announcer. College sports The network also carries many collegiate sports events, including Mountain West Conference football and basketball, Big Sky Conference football, West Coast Conference basketball, Pac-12 Conference football and basketball game replays, Colorado College hockey, and, as a result of the network's continued affiliation with Fox Sports Networks, events from the Big 12, Big East, and Atlantic Coast conferences. In The channel also airs various collegiate and high school insider programming, including Colorado Prep Spotlight, Lobo Football with Bob Davie, Lobo Basketball with Craig Neal, Inside Wyoming Football with Craig Bohl, Inside Wyoming Basketball with Allen Edwards, and Rams Report with Mike Bobo. Former programming =Professional sports= The channel formerly served as the regional cable broadcaster of the NBA's Denver Nuggets and the NHL's Colorado Avalanche, losing the broadcast rights in 2004 when the owner of both teams, Stan Kroenke, launched the competing regional sports network Altitude Sports and Entertainment. The station also served as the regional home of select Western Hockey League broadcasts, beginning with the 2009‚Äì10 season and ending with the 2014‚Äì15 season. =College and high school sports= The network was previously the home of Denver Pioneers hockey and men's and women's basketball, until Altitude Sports and Entertainment took over coverage beginning with the 2016‚Äì17 season. Additionally, the channel served as the official TV home of the Colorado Buffaloes until 2012, producing and airing all football and men's basketball games not picked up by national networks, as well as select other sporting events and a heavy amount of insider programs. The creation of the Pac-12 Network ended the Buffs' longtime relationship with the network, though re-airs of some football and basketball games continue to air. Colorado High School Activities Association football was also a network staple until Altitude took over broadcasting rights beginning with the 2013 season. Regional subfeeds West subfeed On May 23, 2017, it was announced that the network had acquired the regional cable rights to the new Vegas Golden Knights NHL expansion team. These telecasts are available in all of Nevada, and parts of Arizona, and California, including all of San Bernardino County, as well as Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho. The games are also made available on sister network Root Sports Northwest in northern Idaho and Montana. In June 2018, AT&T; SportsNet acquired rights to the newly-relocated Las Vegas Aces of the WNBA. Utah subfeed Since at least 1990, a subfeed of AT&T; SportsNet Rocky Mountain has been operated in the state of Utah that televises Utah Jazz basketball games. The Utah subfeed is available in the entire state of Utah and select areas of Idaho and Wyoming. Jazz games produced by AT&T; SportsNet Rocky Mountain are also available in Idaho and Montana on sister-network Root Sports Northwest. The sub-feed was originally known as Prime Sports Intermountain West, later becoming Fox Sports Utah and Root Sports Utah. Currently the Utah subfeed does not have any different on- air branding from the main network.

Early life  Wigoder, whose father was a dentist, and mother a judge, studied History at Oriel College, Oxford, after attending Manchester Grammar School. During World War II, he served between 1942 and 1945 in the Royal Artillery. On 14 August 1942 he was promoted to second Lieutenant. After the war, he began law studies at Oriel College and he was also president of the Oxford Union, the Debate chamber of the university until 1946. After graduation, he was called to the Bar at Gray's Inn in 1946.  Career   Public prosecutor and lawyer  After being called to the Bar, he dealt mainly with criminal law and was introduced in 1951 by his lawyer A. P. Marshall in the case Willcock v Muckle, which led to the end of the use of identity cards from the war. In the following years, he became one of the leading specialist lawyers for Individual rights. As prosecutor, he worked in the case against Anthony Reuter, a leader of the youth protest movement Teddy Boy, who was sentenced in 1956 for malicious injury to five years imprisonment, and against a man in 1961 to 50 pound sterling after kicking a greyhound at a greyhound race at Wembley.  Liberal Party career  Like many other barristers, Wigoder also engaged in politics and ran in the 1945 United Kingdom general election, and in a by-election on 15 November 1945 for the Liberal Party in the Bournemouth constituency. He was unsuccessful in both elections for a parliamentary mandate in the House of Commons. Wigoder remained prominent in Liberal politics, standing in Westbury in 1959 and 1964, without success. In 1963, he succeeded Desmond Banks as Executive Chairman of the Liberal Party and held the position until his replacement by Gruffyd Evans. Subsequently, he was Chairman of the Committee for the Organisation of the Party Lectures of the Liberal Party between 1965 and 1966.  Significant trials as a defence lawyer  On 20 April 1966 Wigoder was appointed for his legal services to the Crown lawyer (Queen's Counsel), and then dealt with many significant cases before the Old Bailey, the Central Criminal Court. One of his earliest defences after his appointment as Crown Attorney was a successful case before Gerald Thesiger, a Judge of the Civil Division (Queen's Bench Division) of the UK and Wales High Court of Justice. In the case of a man accused of murdering another guest at a celebration in Notting Hill, he successfully defended the defendant by defending him against a groundless attack. Afterwards he was a sought after defence lawyer and had over time known clients such as the former Paymaster General George Wigg, who was acquitted in a case of prostitution, or Sheila Buckley, a lover of former Labour Party politician John Stonehouse, who was sued for simulating suicide in 1974. In other proceedings, he defended the painter Francis Bacon for possession of cannabis and Alfred Berman, one of the defendants in the trial of the so-called Richardson Gang in 1966. Unlike most of the co-defendants, Berman was acquitted. Also in 1966, Wigoder appeared in a mysterious case against the native of Nigeria student Orishagbemi, who was charged with the murder of his tenant. As a defence, it was portrayed that this girl was a witch who had cursed Orishagbemi and his wife; Orishagbemi had only tried to ward off this curse. In the face of this hopeless defence, Wigoder lost the case. In 1967, Wigoder was commissioned by the Ministry of Commerce to investigate the events surrounding the financial services institution Pinnock Finance. His other clients included the House of Commons journalist and later Conservative Member of Parliament Jonathan Aitken, who was charged in 1971 under the Official Secrets Act for passing classified information about the Biafra war to the weekly The Sunday Telegraph. Wigoder successfully argued in his plea in favour of Aitken that it was his duty \\"to act in the interests of the state\\". This plea has since become a basis for similar processes. Over the years he has been a constant critic of the provisions of this law, which he considered illiberal and unfair. Most recently, Wigoder appeared as a defence lawyer in a series of lawsuits against the Irish Republican Army (IRA), such as a defendant in the Aldershot Garrison bombing trial in 1972, and the so-called Guildford Four, who were alleged IRA terrorists. They were convicted of bombings on a pub in Guildford in 1975. It was only in 1989 that a review procedure was initiated which led to the annulment of the judgements.  Engagements in legal organisations  In 1970 he became a member of the General Council of the Bar and remained a member until 1974. Furthermore, Wigoder worked between 1971 and 1977 as a member of the Rules Committee at the Crown Court and then from 1972 to 1984 as a writer (Recorder) of the Crown Court. During this time he was with the Attorney Lewis Hawser, who was Co-chair of a Judiciary Committee, which proposed the transfer of criminal proceedings from the police to an independent public prosecution authority. In 1972 he founded the Criminal Bar Association with Jeremy Hutchinson.  House of Lords  On 16 May 1974, by Letters patent, Wigoder was created a Life peer as Baron Wigoder, of Cheetham in the City of Manchester, therefore he had the peerage until his death, and was a member of the House of Lords. During his senior citizenship, he was the leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords, after his appointment by Frank Byers, Baron Byers, first Parliamentary Chief Executive of the Liberal Party (Liberal Chief Whip in the House of Lords) 1977‚Äì1984 and later spokesman for his group for domestic and health policy. In his House speeches, he was extremely critical of government proposals regarding both the limitation of jury trial rights and the curtailment of a right to appeal in so-called \\"lenient sentencing cases\\".  Other commitments  Baron Wigoder became chairman of the Health Services Board in 1977 and, after being dissolved by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1980, became its chairman from 1981 to 1992, and subsequently chairmanchairman of the healthcare company Bupa. He also served from 1984 to 1990 as President of the Statute Society.James Morton, \\"Obituary: Lord Wigoder\\", The Guardian, 3 September 2004  Personal life  Wigoder lived in London for most of his adult life after being brought up in Manchester. He married Yolanda Levinson in 1948 and had four children, including the businessman and business manager Charles Wigoder, who is also executive chairman of the telecommunications company Telecom Plus. He died on 12 August 2004 after illness. Arms  External links   Entry in Cracroft's Peerage  Entry in Leigh Rayment Peerage  Entry in They Work For You  Obituary: Lord Wigoder.

Waugh at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Due to the suggestive nature of its acronym, the latter name is used more often. This technique is an integral part of most solid-state NMR experiments involving spin-1/2 nuclei. PENIS was one of the first of Pines' experiments transferring spin orientation from one atomic nucleus to another, which has been one of the running themes throughout his career as a leading pioneer in the applications of NMR to the study of non-liquid samples. The PENIS technique was patented in 1972.  Technique  In this technique the natural polarization of an abundant spin (1H, the \\"proton\\" which begins the name of the technique) is exploited to increase the polarization of a rare spin (such as 13C) by irradiating the sample with radio waves at the frequency which corresponds to the difference between the rotation frequencies of the two different spins. Besides its utility for boosting signals from dilute spins, transferring spin-polarization can also be used by surface-scientists to selectively enhance the spin-polarization of molecules on a sample's surface over the spins in the bulk by transferring spin-polarization from a gas to the surface.

A native of Iowa, his family moved to Oregon Country when he was an infant where he was raised and started his medical career. He practiced the majority of his career in Astoria, Oregon, and was a leading expert on tuberculosis. Early life Augustus Kinney was born on July 26, 1845, to Robert and Eliza Lee (n√©e Bigelow) Kinney in Muscatine, Iowa.Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 135. Two years later he traveled the Oregon Trail with his family in a wagon train that included Joel Palmer and his family. Kinney's family settled in the Chehalem Valley of what is now Yamhill County, Oregon, where his father grew an orchard. His father also was a member of the Oregon Constitutional Convention and territorial legislator.Bancroft, Hubert Howe, and Mrs. Frances Auretta Fuller Barrett Victor. History of Oregon. Vol. 1. San Francisco: History Co, 1886. p. 633. Augustus earned his education at Pacific University in Forest Grove, and at McMinnville College (now Linfield College) in McMinnville, before entering medical school. In 1866, he married Jane Welch, and the marriage did not produce any children. He started his medical training at Willamette University College of Medicine in Salem where he graduated in 1869, and the next year he graduated from Bellevue Hospital Medical College (now New York University School of Medicine) in New York City. Kinney was one of eleven children in the family, with eight living to adulthood, including his younger brother Alfred who also graduated from medical school. Career In 1871, Kinney began a medical practice in Portland, Oregon, where his brother joined him. He left Portland in 1873 for California, where he remained until 1875 when he returned to Oregon. Kinney set up practice in Astoria where he remained until his death. His treatments for tuberculosis received notoriety from around the world and was considered a leading expert on the disease in the United States. Kinney was also a frequent contributor to medical journals.Gaston, Joseph. 1911. Portland, Oregon, its history and builders: in connection with the antecedent explorations, discoveries, and movements of the pioneers that selected the site for the great city of the Pacific. Chicago: S.J. Clarke Pub. Co. Vol. III. p. 417. Later life Kinney did some scientific work in addition to his medical work. This included studying the Nehalem Beeswax along the Oregon Coast, which Kinney believed was ozocerite. He also donated a collection of fish from Astoria to the Smithsonian Institution in 1888. Augustus Kinney died on March 24, 1908, at the age of 62 at the Fabiola Hospital in Oakland, California, of cancer and was buried at the IOOF Cemetery (now Salem Pioneer Cemetery) in Salem. His nephew Augustus, from his brother Alfred, also was a doctor who studied tuberculosis.

Downtown Cincinnati's streets are arranged on a grid. Streets are split between the east and west by Vine Street. Bridges from Downtown Cincinnati span the Ohio River across to Covington and Newport in Northern Kentucky. Often considered to be the heart of Cincinnati, Fountain Square is located in the center of the Central Business District. The 1871 dedicated Tyler Davidson Fountain stands prominently on the often busy city square. Other city parks located Downtown are Lytle Park and Piatt Park. The Backstage District that sprang up around the Aronoff Center contains nightlife and dining options. Cityscape Downtown Cincinnati is marked by its large collection of historic architecture and contains several historic districts and dozens of buildings on the National Register of Historic Places listings in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. All but one of the twenty-five tallest buildings in Cincinnati are located in Downtown Cincinnati. The Carew Tower has a public observation deck on the forty-ninth floor. Since 1971, the Cincinnati Skywalk has connected buildings throughout downtown via a series of primarily indoor, elevated walkways. The Skywalk was officially completed as a 1.3 mile contiguous path in 1997, but has since fallen into disfavor by city leaders, and some sections have been removed. Culture Downtown Cincinnati is an increasingly residential area with former commercial space, such as Park Place at Lytle, being converted into luxury condos. The population was 4,850 at the 2010 census. Museums downtown include the high-rise Contemporary Arts Center, National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, and the Taft Museum of Art. The Banks is a waterfront mixed-use development hosting bars and restaurants. It is especially crowded following games at the adjacent Paul Brown Stadium and Great American Ball Park, the stadiums of the Cincinnati Bengals and Cincinnati Reds. Economy Downtown has long been the economic hub of Cincinnati. In the mid-nineteenth century, 16 of the city's 24 banks were located on Third Street near the busy Public Landing river port. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, the center of business activity moved to Fourth Street, closer to where it remains today. Kroger, Macy's, Inc., Fifth Third Bank, Procter & Gamble, Western & Southern Financial Group, American Financial Group, and Cincinnati Bell are all headquartered in Downtown Cincinnati. The Duke Energy Convention Center is the convention center of Cincinnati. Opened in 1968, it offers of meeting space. Local government The historic Cincinnati City Hall is located downtown on Plum Street. The Hamilton County Courthouse is connected to the Hamilton County Justice Center via a skybridge. Media The Cincinnati Enquirer, the daily citywide newspaper, has its headquarters downtown, as does the alternative newspaper Cincinnati CityBeat. Transportation Downtown is a transportation hub for the entire region. Downtown is served by Fort Washington Way which connects interstates 71 and 75 with Route 50. Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority operates public transportation with its transit hub at Government Square.

Description and history  The William Austin House (34 Seneca Street, Trumansburg, NY 14886) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Portions of the text below were adapted from a copy of the original nomination document. [1] Adaptation copyright ¬© 2008, The Gombach Group. Description The William Austin House, built in 1870, is a fashionable, Second Empire style brick dwelling located in the northwestern fringes of the historic core of the village of Trumansburg. The immediate neighborhood around the Austin House consists of late nineteenth and early twentieth century dwellings on relatively small village lots informally landscaped with lawns and mature trees and shrubbery. The dwelling is located on a .68-acre corner lot at the intersection of Seneca and Bradley Streets; a circular gravel driveway provides access to the front (south) facade of the house overlooking Seneca Street. There are no outbuildings located on the property. The Austin house consists of a large, essentially rectangular, 2 1/2 story brick main block and an asymmetrically placed rear wing. Overall features of the building include slate-clad, Mansard roofs pierced by dormer windows accented by round or miter-arched lintels; broadly projecting eaves supported by elaborate scroll brackets; and generally regular fenestration, with paired and single double-hung sash predominating. Most window openings are rectangular and feature simple iron sills and flat-arched iron lintels; the second story of the front facade is enlivened by a prominent pair of round-arched windows with keystoned iron lintels. Third-story dormer windows are generally rectangular, although a few asymmetrically placed round- arched windows and oculi accentuate the Mansard roof. The front facade and west elevation of the main block are dominated by a handsome verandah with a slate-clad, Mansard roof pierced by tiny, decorative dormer windows (with round or miter-arched lintels). Bold, square posts with elegant, molded details support the verandah's broadly projecting, bracketed eaves. The main entrance consists of a pair of molded wood doors surmounted by a large, round- arched fanlight. The east elevation of the main block features a prominent, two-story bay window; the east elevation of the rear (north) wing contains a secondary entrance with a small, yet handsome, porch with Victorian-inspired details similar to those found on the front verandah. Many of the building's interior features survive with a high degree of integrity of design, materials and craftsmanship. Notable features include original room configurations, a variety of restrained Victorian era woodwork (window trim; baseboards; wainscoting) and original staircases. Of particular note are four marble fireplaces with elaborate Eastlake inspired details. Significance The William Austin House, built in 1870, is architecturally significantly as an outstanding example of Second Empire style domestic architecture in the village of Trumansburg, Tompkins County. Characterized by a prominent, slate- clad Mansard roof, polychrome masonry construction, asymmetrical massing and elaborate, Victorian era ornamentation, it embodies all of the distinctive characteristics of the type and period. The area that is now the village of Trumansburg was originally settled by Abner Treman (also spelled Tremaine), a Revolutionary War veteran who acquired a tract of land within New York State's Military Tract. Applying for his tract under the name of Abner Trimmins, Treman arrived in 1793 with his wife (Mary McLallen) and three children (Mary, Jonathan, and Annis). Treman is credited with establishing the first mill in the area that later became Trumansburg (name derived and corrupted from Treman/Tremaine). Trumansburg was one of several concentrations of settlement in the town of Ulysses, which was officially formed on March 5, 1799. By 1803, the first church (formed by Jedediah Chapman to serve the needs of a small group of Presbyterians) was built. The fast-slowing Taughanick Creek, ultimately emptying into Cayuga Lake, provided hydropower for a variety of early and mid-nineteenth century industrial ventures. On the eve of the Civil War, Ulysses boasted four main settlements: Trumansburg, Jacksonville, Waterburgh, and Halseyville. By 1860, there were six churches scattered throughout Ulysses; four were located in Trumansburg. Home to 1,052 souls (R. P. Smith's Historical and Statistical Gazetteer of New York State, 1860), Trumansburg also boasted numerous commercial establishments and the renowned Trumansburg Academy. Trumansburg continued to flourish after the Civil War, rivaled only by the nearby city of Ithaca as Tompkins County's focal points of commercial, social, civic and educational activity. At this time, one of Trumansburg's foremost citizens was William Austin, a Civil War veteran who had served as a lieutenant colonel in the infantry of the 109th NY Vol. William, born in 1832, was the son of David R. and Lydia (Rhodes) Austin of nearby Odessa, NY. After the war, Austin was a prominent lawyer in Trumansburg; in 1872 he served as the village clerk. Befitting his prominent position in the community, Austin built a fashionable Second Empire style dwelling for his family (including his wife, Anne E., and their five daughters) in an upscale residential neighborhood of the bustling village. With the exception of some interior deterioration due to neglect, the building, as it stands today, remains an intact, representative example of Victorian era domestic architecture in Trumansburg. Characteristic features of the type and period ‚Äî specifically, the Second Empire style ‚Äî displayed by the house include a prominent, slat-clad Mansard roof with bracketed eaves and dormer windows; overall asymmetry in form, plan and massing; decorative window treatments, including molded iron lintels; and a sweeping verandah with a bracketed, Mansard roof supported by ornate wood columns. William died in 1909 and Ann E. died in 1919, after which the house came into the possession of the by then married daughters, Mary Ogden, Ida Astinger, Elizabeth Wood, Helen Halsey and Pearl Haas. In 1928, the property was acquired by three young sisters in the Jeffery family, Mary Jane, Frances and Bessie. In 1951, the Jeffery sisters sold the property to the Dubois family, who leased the building out to a series of tenants between 1951 and 1969. The property changed ownership several times during the next few years; the longest subsequent tenant was the Neglia family between 1972 and 2001. The current owner, who purchased the neglected, but still grand, old house in January 2001, is [at the time of this writing] in the process of restoring the building (particularly the deteriorated interior features). # Todd, Nancy L., NY State Division of Historic Preservation, William Austin House, Trumansburg, Tompkins County, New York, nomination document, 2002, National Park Service, National Register of Historic Places, Washington, D.C.

Section 1(1) of the Act provides: > \\"Where any person suffers damage as the result partly of his own fault and > partly of the fault of any other person(s), a claim in respect of that > damage will not be defeated by reason of the fault of the person suffering > the damage, but the damages recoverable in respect thereof shall be reduced > to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the > claimant's share in the responsibility for the damage.\\" Historical background Until the Act was passed, English tort law had held that contributory negligence was a full defence to negligence. This rule composed what is sometimes called the \\"unholy trinity\\" of defences to negligence which wrought particular hardship on 19th century workers, and barred them from any compensation for ghastly workplace injuries (the other two are common employmentPriestly v Fowler (1837) 3 Mees & Wels 1 and volenti non fit injuria). It meant that if an employer was 99% at fault for his worker being mangled in his machinery, but the worker was 1% at fault, then the worker could recover nothing in compensation for injuries. Outside the workplace, an example of the defence is found in Waite v North-Eastern Railway Co(1858) EB&E; 719 where a grandmother and an infant that were hit by a negligently driven train were barred from any claim. The Act was passed by the new Labour government following World War II, along with a number of other workplace safety and common law reforms (e.g., Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948). This harsh common law defence subsisted longer in other countries than in the United Kingdom. An example is seen in The Wagon Mound (No 1) where the claimant conceded that a burning ship accident was unforeseeable in order to avoid the contemporary Australian contributory negligence bar. This 1945 Act was not based on entirely new principles: the Collision Convention of 1910 had already provided that where two ships collide, blame may be apportioned between the two, so that each's contribution to the accident may be calculated to determine the settlement by way of damages. Often, blameworthiness reflected each party's degree of breach of the COLREGS. Normally blame would be apportioned in simple ratios; 50:50, 60:40, 75:25, etc.) Only rarely would the proportion be 100:0, as in The Oropesa.The Oropesa [1943] 1 All ER 211The Oropesa case report in the UK, before the wearing of car seatbelts become obligatory, difficult legal questions arose when a passenger who failed to wear a seatbelt was injured. If the passenger had voluntarily chosen not to wear a seatbelt, was that person volenti to the injury? If so, volenti being a complete defence, the passenger would fail in a claim for negligence. In Froom v Butcher,Froom V Butcher[1976] 1 QB 286; [1975] 3 WLR 379; [1975] 3 All ER 520;[1975] 2 Lloyd's Rep 478; [1975] RTR 518; (1975) 119 SJ 613Case summary [v] Lord Denning MR sliced the Gordian knot by declaring that such a passenger was NOT volenti but rather was 20% contributorily negligent in the matter. Denning MR declared that \\"determining whether one is guilty of contributory negligence is a matter not of the cause of the accident, but of the cause of the damage\\", and he thereby ensured that the injured passenger could successfully claim against the driver's insurance, albeit that the claim would be only 80% of the loss.

He held the office of Vice-Chancellor of Switzerland between 1981 and 2005, and during this time became the first official spokesman for the Swiss Federal Council when that role was created on 1 September 2000.  Early life and education  Born in Zurich in 1941 but originating from the Italian- speaking canton Ticino, he first attended school in Lugano, before studying political science at the universities of Bern and Fribourg. He began working as a journalist for the national press agency of Switzerland, before joining the Swiss Italian Television RSI in 1966.  Career  During his tenure, Achille Casanova worked with 26 different Federal Councillors (out of 108 ever elected by the time of his resignation), participated in over 1180 Federal Council sessions, and officiated under three different Chancellors. While he was a candidate for the office twice himself, the Swiss Federal Assembly elected other candidates every time. Fluent in German, French, Italian and English, his resignation sparked a minor row over language representation within the Swiss Federal government, when his successor, Oswald Sigg, was named over several candidates from Swiss-French and Swiss-Italian regions. This was compounded by the fact that his office (the second Vice-chancellor, in charge of the Information & Communication sector) had initially been created in 1895 on an ad-hoc basis, to add a senior representative of the French and Italian speaking regions when both the Chancellor and the other Vice-chancellors came from German-speaking cantons. After retiring from office in 2005, he joined the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation SRG as its Ombudsman. In January 2006, he was appointed Chairman of the International Balzan Prize Foundation.  Personal life  Casanova was married and a father to two grown-up children. Casanova died on 17 July 2016 after a serious illness. He was 74 years old.

The bout was held on November 14, 2009, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. Pacquiao won the fight via technical knockout in the twelfth round. Negotiations The fight was sanctioned as a world title fight in the welterweight division, where the weight limit is 147 pounds, however Cotto's camp agreed to fight at a catchweight of 145 pounds to accommodate Pacquiao's smaller physique. Cotto's camp also conceded the larger share of the purse to Pacquiao, who received a 65% share of pay-per-view buys, compared to Cotto's 35% share. The fight Rounds 1‚Äì8 In the opening round both fighters were tentative, although Cotto appeared to have the edge, as he connected with several solid jabs that arguably won him the round. However, from the second round onwards Pacquiao picked up the pace, as he knocked Cotto down in round three with a right hook, and then again in round four with a left uppercut. In round five Cotto mounted a brief comeback and arguably won the round, but thereafter Pacquiao went on to dominate the fight. Cotto had some success when he managed to pin Pacquiao against the ropes, although Pacquiao later admitted that he had allowed this to happen, as he wanted to test Cotto's power. Rounds 9‚Äì12 After a one-sided ninth round in favor of Pacquiao, wherein Cotto received significant punishment, many people thought that Cotto's corner should have stopped the fight. At this point, Cotto's wife even left the arena. However, a bloodied up Cotto decided to continue the fight, but he could not evade Pacquiao's onslaught, prompting the referee to stop the fight fifty-five seconds into the twelfth round. Pacquiao was ahead on all three judges' scorecards before the stoppage, which read 109‚Äì99, 108‚Äì99, and 108‚Äì100, all in favor of Pacquiao.BoxRec, Miguel Angel Cotto vs. Manny Pacquiao Punch stats *Total punches: Pacquiao landed 336 out of 780 (43%), whereas Cotto landed 172 out of 597 (29%). *Total jabs: Pacquiao landed 60 out of 220 (27%), whereas Cotto landed 79 out of 297 (27%). *Total power punches: Pacquiao landed 276 out of 560 (49%), whereas Cotto landed 93 out of 300(31%).

It is a demersal fish that lives on sand and gravel bottoms at depths of up to , though it is most commonly found between . Its native habitat is the temperate waters of the northern Pacific, from Baja California to Alaska, the Aleutian Islands and southeastern parts of the Bering Sea. It grows up to in length and can weigh up to , and has a maximum recorded lifespan of 22 years. Taxonomy and nomenclature Prior to 2000 the Northern rock sole and the rock sole, Lepidopsetta bilineata, were considered to be a single species under the genus Lepidopsetta, but work by Orr & Matarese published in 2000 reorganised the genus into three separate taxa. As a result of this reclassification and renaming, the rock sole may be referred to as the \\"southern\\" rock sole, in order to avoid confusion with the Northern rock sole L. polyxystra. Description The rock sole is a right-eyed flounder. Its upper surface is grey to olive to dark brown or black, lighter or darker mottling, and is sometimes marked with yellow or red spots; the underside is light. Its dorsal and anal fins have dark blotches or bars, and near the tail fins may be yellowish. The caudal fin is convex ‚Äì rounded or broadly v-shaped. It has a small mouth with fleshy lips, and teeth are more strongly developed on the underside. Role in ecosystem The rock sole occupies a moderately high trophic level in the food chain. Diet The diet of the rock soles consists mainly of zoobenthos organisms such as molluscs, crustaceans, brittle stars, marine worms and other fish. Predators Rock soles are eaten by marine mammals and other fish, including sharks, Alaska pollock, yellowfin sole, Pacific halibut and Pacific cod. Reproduction Rock soles reach reproductive maturity at between 4 and 7 years old, and spawn in winter through to early spring. Eggs are demersal and stick to the surface on which they are laid; hatching takes from 6 to 25 days. Commercial fishing The rock sole is fished commercially, and forms an important part of two trawl fisheries in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. Although it was overfished in the 1960s stocks have recovered, and the biomass of rock sole in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands population is now estimated to be very high, at twice the level required to support maximum sustainable yield. In 2008 the estimated rock sole biomass in the Gulf of Alaska fishery was some 161,617 tons, compared to catches ranging from 1,468 tons in 2004 to 4,260 tons in 2007. Alaska accounts for the majority of the worldwide harvest of this fish, catching over 52,000 tons of rock sole in 2008. Rock sole fishing off the coast of the United States is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council and the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, two of eight U.S. Regional Fishery Management Councils.

It concerns the exercise of discretion under s 2(2) Misrepresentation Act 1967. Facts William Sindall agreed to buy land from Cambridgeshire County Council after they were told the council were aware of no easements. But a private sewer from 20 years before was found after completion. The important point was, however, that after William Sindall plc made the purchase the property market crashed and the value of the land plummeted. William Sindall plc sued for rescission for misrepresentation and common mistake. For mistake, it was held that the contract allocated risk of unknown sewers to the buyer (now rescission for common mistake on the grounds of equity is impossible unless the mistake is fundamental because of The Great Peace). Judgment Hoffmann LJ held there was no misrepresentation and no operative mistake. However, had it been necessary for the exercise of discretion under s 2(2) he said that the three factors for deciding what is ‚Äòequitable‚Äô are, *the nature of the misrepresentation; here it was a ¬£5m land sale, but the misrepresentation would only cost ¬£18k to put right *loss caused were the contract upheld; this is a power to award damages where none were previously recoverable. Because of s 2(3) this is not compensation for the loss, but damages for the misrepresentation as such. *taking into account that the loss of a bargain was ¬£8m for the council and the ‚Äògross disparity‚Äô to the loss to Sindall plc he would have exercised his discretion and awarded damages. Hoffmann LJ said that section 2(1) is concerned with the ‚Äòdamage flowing from having entered into the contract, while section 2(2) is concerned with damage caused by the property not being what it was represented to be.‚Äô The point of s 2(2) is to have a different effect to s 2(1), so that representors are not unfairly oppressed when someone gets out of a bargain after a little misrepresentation. In this case he would have exercised discretion under s 2(2) so as to prevent William Sindall plc escaping from a bad bargain. Evans LJ noted the loss would be very great to the Council because now the land was worth a fraction of the purchase price plus interest, as well as it having to repeat the tendering process.

But he argues the suggestion of awarding reliance loss but ignoring post contract fall in the market is good, more consistent with s 2(2) and Hoffmann LJ‚Äôs speech.

Facts The Government of Zanzibar wanted to buy an executive jet from British Aerospace. They entered a contract with a finance company. That company bought the plane and leased it back to the Government. The plane was faulty. It was returned to British Aerospace. It was repaired but the faults continued. The Government stopped paying instalments on the lease agreement. The finance company took possession of the plane and sold it. The Government brought an action against British Aerospace to rescind the contract, or alternatively get damages under MA 1967 s 2(1) or s 2(2). It said representations were made that the plane was airworthy, reliable and without design or construction defects. British Aerospace claimed that counter restitution (i.e. putting the parties back in their original position, giving the jet back) had become impossible now that the finance company sold the jet on. This acted as a bar to rescission, and damages under s 2(2) were precluded if rescission was barred. As for s 2(1), clause 23 of the sale agreement, which said the buyer would not rely on the seller's representations, excluded liability. Judgment Judge Raymond Jack QC held that the Government had no right to rescission or damages. The contract could not have been rescinded because the plane had been sold. So counter restitution was impossible. It followed that s 2(2) damages were unavailable, because damages are dependent according to the provision's wording on the right to rescission. Damages are available only as a substitute for rescission when the court believes damages are more equitable as a solution. Judge Raymond Jack QC said, The second issue was that clause 23 excluded liability for misrepresentation under s 2(1). This depended on whether the clause passed the reasonableness test under s 3, in conjunction with the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 s 11 and Sch 2. Judge Raymond Jack QC held that there was insufficient evidence to show whether it passed or failed the reasonableness test, but that Zanzibar would not necessarily fail in showing the clause was unreasonable.

The National War Memorial Southern Command which commemorates the sacrifice of soldiers of the Indian Armed Forces is also situated in the cantonment. History The British Indian Army already had a small encampment west of the Mula River in Khadki. As more troops were required to be accommodated, a larger area was occupied to the west of the Mutha River, leading to the establishment of the Pune Cantonment in 1817 for accommodating troops of the British Indian Army. The villages of Mali, Munjeri, Wanowrie and Ghorpuri (Ghorpadi) were selected for this purpose. Initially, a garrison for 4,620 troops was planned for the cantonment. This included two European regiments, a mountain battery, a native cavalry and three native regiments. A central belt of was designated for training and drills. The firing ranges were located at Golibar Maidan. Soon a large number of civilians began settling in the area. This was encouraged since civilians provided services to troops garrisoned in the cantonment.

In the course of so doing D negligently misrepresented that there was a special one off expense of GBP 120,000 in accounts produced, and that those accounts spread the bi-annual expense of producing pattern books over two years instead of immediately writing it off. The sale contract included a provision stating that P acknowledged it had not been induced to enter into the agreement by any representation or warranty, and a contractual limitation clause that D was not liable for a breach of the agreement unless written notice was given by January 1, 1992. When P sued for negligent misrepresentation, D sought to rely on those two contractual provisions. Judgment Jacob J held rescission was no longer available where it was impossible to restore the parties to their positions before the contract. He referred to the Solicitor General while the Act was being passed, however, saying that damages could be awarded where rescission was no longer available, and so under s 2(2) the right to damages did not depend on the right to rescission - it was only necessary that the right to rescind had existed in the past - even if there was a bar now.

In practice all DRAM chips share all of the other command and control signals, and only the chip select pins for each rank are separate (the data pins are shared across ranks). The term rank was created and defined by JEDEC, the memory industry standards group. On a DDR, DDR2, or DDR3 memory module, each rank has a 64-bit-wide data bus (72 bits wide on DIMMs that support ECC). The number of physical DRAMs depends on their individual widths. For example, a rank of √ó8 (8-bit wide) DRAMs would consist of eight physical chips (nine if ECC is supported), but a rank of √ó4 (4-bit wide) DRAMs would consist of 16 physical chips (18, if ECC is supported). Multiple ranks can coexist on a single DIMM, and modern DIMMs can consist of one rank (single rank), two ranks (dual rank), four ranks (quad rank), or eight ranks (octal rank). There is only a little difference between a dual rank UDIMM and two single-rank UDIMMs in the same memory channel, other than that the DRAMs reside on different PCBs. The electrical connections between the memory controller and the DRAMs are almost identical (with the possible exception of which chip selects go to which ranks). Increasing the number of ranks per DIMM is mainly intended to increase the memory density per channel. Too many ranks in the channel can cause excessive loading and decrease the speed of the channel. Also some memory controllers have a maximum supported number of ranks. DRAM load on the command/address (CA) bus can be reduced by using registered memory. Predating the term rank (sometimes also called row) is the use of single-sided and double-sided modules, especially with SIMMs. While most often the number of sides used to carry RAM chips corresponded to the number of ranks, sometimes they did not. This could lead to confusion and technical issues. Performance of multiple rank modules There are several effects to consider regarding memory performance in multi-rank configurations: * Multi-rank modules allow several open DRAM pages (row) in each rank (typically eight pages per rank). This increases the possibility of getting a hit on an already open row address. The performance gain that can be achieved is highly dependent on the application and the memory controller's ability to take advantage of open pages. * Multi-rank modules have higher loading on the data bus (and on unbuffered DIMMs the CA bus as well). Therefore if more than dual rank DIMMS are connected in one channel, the speed might be reduced. * Subject to some limitations, ranks can be accessed independently, although not simultaneously as the data lines are still shared between ranks on a channel. For example, the controller can send write data to one rank while it awaits read data previously selected from another rank. While the write data is consumed from the data bus, the other rank could perform read-related operations such as the activation of a row or internal transfer of the data to the output drivers. Once the CA bus is free from noise from the previous read, the DRAM can drive out the read data. Controlling interleaved accesses like so is done by the memory controller. * There is a small performance reduction for multi-rank systems as they require some pipeline stalls between accessing different ranks. For two ranks on a single DIMM it might not even be required, but this parameter is often programmed independently of the rank location in the system (if on the same DIMM or different DIMMs). Nevertheless, this pipeline stall is negligible compared to the aforementioned effects.

San Francisco City & County, 1859‚Äì1862On July 22, 1861, Brigadier-General Cobb ordered a court martial to convene at the armory of the City Guard for the trial of lieutenants Ducroynell and Gailhard, and such other officers of the French Guard that may be brought before it. The officers named were from the Carbineers, and their offense consisted of their refusal to recognize Eugene Villargne as captain. The lieutenants contended the captain had resigned and his resignation had been accepted, therefore, he had no authority over them. (San Francisco Daily Herald, July 22, 1861, page 1, column 1.) No records are available that would reveal what the outcome of the court martial was, but the Adjutant General's Report of 1862 shows that the then Lieutenant Gailhard had been elected captain of the Carbineers, succeeding E.

P. Parameswaran is an Indian nuclear engineer and educationist. He played an important role in the Indian Nuclear program.  Education  He was born on 18 January 1935 in Kerala. In 1956, he received a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Engineering from the College of Engineering, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. He then joined Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in Bombay and continued there till1975. From 1969 to 1973 he worked as the Assistant Director of the State Institute of Languages in Kerala, on a deputation from BARC. He got a PhD in Nuclear Engineering from the Moscow Power Engineering Institute in 1965.  Indian Science Movement  During the 1970s, a people's science movement called Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad (KSSP) was formed in Kerala and created a new movement among science teachers and science communicators in the state. He resigned from his job in 1975 to take part in the movement. Since then he has been a full-time activist of the Kerala Sasthra Sahitya Parishad (KSSP). Under his leadership, the KSSP grew into a massive people‚Äôs movement and influenced science communicators all over the country. M. P. Parameswaran Kerala Sasthra Sahitya Parishad After KSSP became a success in Kerala, M. P. Parameswaran took steps to enlarge the canvas at the national level. In 1987, as Convener of the National Organising Committee of the Bharat Jan Vigyan Jatha, a unique communication event for India - he significantly contributed to the conceptualisation, organisation and conduct of this massive communication experiment. He had also been instrumental in the setting up of the All India People's Science Network (AIPSN), a common platform of people science movements in India. In 1990, he was instrumental in the organisation of the Bharat Gyan Vigyan Jatha in support of the National Literacy Mission Programme, which was organised from 2 October 1990 to 14 November 1990. This led to the formation of Bharat Gyan Vigyan Samiti (BGVS), which was responsible for the massive literacy campaign initiated in India.  Contribution in Science and Technology  Dr. M. P. Parameswaran at Thrissur 2014 MP is a prolific writer, having written 29 popular science books in Malayalam and two in English. His books give a panoramic view of science. Radioactivity, atomic science, astronomy, mathematics, political science, social science, ecology - these are some of the varied subjects he has dealt with in his books. A vision of \\"A New World - A New India\\" guides his thoughts and actions. He was the recipient of two national awards, one for science popularisation and another for literacy. He has written more than 300 articles in various periodicals. He has received Government of India awards for \\"Books for Neoliterates\\" (1962) and \\"Basic and Cultural Literature\\" (1964). He also received an Award for Children's Literature in 1982. He was an active member of Communist Party of India (Marxist) for 33 years, before being expelled for writing an ideological book 'Fourth World' which envisions a world based on decentralised democracy and an economic production that is detached from consumerism. The party viewed it as a rejection of Marxist principles. As Assistant Director of Kerala Institute of Languages, he was instrumental in designing the layout for Malayalam keyboard for typewriters, which was later adopted in the inscript layout for computers. In 2007, he acted in a Malayalam movie named AKG about the Communist leader A K Gopalan in which M. P. Parameswaran donned the role of Kerala's first Chief Minister E M Sankaran Namboodiripad (EMS). He had published the book Janakeeya Sasthra Prasthanam in 2008. The third edition of the book was recently published.

A full survey of the different versions of LBP can be found in Bouwmans et al.T. Bouwmans, C. Silva, C. Marghes, M. Zitouni, H. Bhaskar, C. Frelicot,, \\"On the Role and the Importance of Features for Background Modeling and Foreground Detection‚Äù,  Concept  Three neighborhood examples used to define a texture and calculate a local binary pattern (LBP) The LBP feature vector, in its simplest form, is created in the following manner: * Divide the examined window into cells (e.g. 16x16 pixels for each cell). * For each pixel in a cell, compare the pixel to each of its 8 neighbors (on its left-top, left-middle, left-bottom, right-top, etc.). Follow the pixels along a circle, i.e. clockwise or counter-clockwise. * Where the center pixel's value is greater than the neighbor's value, write \\"0\\". Otherwise, write \\"1\\". This gives an 8-digit binary number (which is usually converted to decimal for convenience). * Compute the histogram, over the cell, of the frequency of each \\"number\\" occurring (i.e., each combination of which pixels are smaller and which are greater than the center). This histogram can be seen as a 256-dimensional feature vector. * Optionally normalize the histogram. * Concatenate (normalized) histograms of all cells. This gives a feature vector for the entire window. The feature vector can now be processed using the Support vector machine, extreme learning machines, or some other machine learning algorithm to classify images. Such classifiers can be used for face recognition or texture analysis. A useful extension to the original operator is the so-called uniform pattern,Barkan et. al \\"Fast High Dimensional Vector Multiplication Face Recognition.\\" Proceedings of ICCV 2013 which can be used to reduce the length of the feature vector and implement a simple rotation invariant descriptor. This idea is motivated by the fact that some binary patterns occur more commonly in texture images than others. A local binary pattern is called uniform if the binary pattern contains at most two 0-1 or 1-0 transitions. For example, 00010000 (2 transitions) is a uniform pattern, but 01010100 (6 transitions) is not. In the computation of the LBP histogram, the histogram has a separate bin for every uniform pattern, and all non-uniform patterns are assigned to a single bin. Using uniform patterns, the length of the feature vector for a single cell reduces from 256 to 59. The 58 uniform binary patterns correspond to the integers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 24, 28, 30, 31, 32, 48, 56, 60, 62, 63, 64, 96, 112, 120, 124, 126, 127, 128, 129, 131, 135, 143, 159, 191, 192, 193, 195, 199, 207, 223, 224, 225, 227, 231, 239, 240, 241, 243, 247, 248, 249, 251, 252, 253, 254 and 255.  Extensions  * Over-Complete Local Binary Patterns (OCLBP):Barkan et. al \\"Fast High Dimensional Vector Multiplication Face Recognition.\\" Proceedings of ICCV 2013 OCLBP is a variant of LBP that has been shown to improve the overall performance on face verification. Unlike LBP, OCLBP adopts overlapping to adjacent blocks. Formally, the configuration of OCLBP is denoted as S : (a, b, v, h, p, r): an image is divided into a√ób blocks with vertical overlap of v and horizontal overlap of h, and then uniform patterns LBP(u2,p,r) are extracted from all the blocks. Moreover, OCLBP is composed of several different configurations. For example, in their original paper, the authors used three configurations: S : (10,10,12,12,8,1),(14,14,12,12,8,2),(18,18,12,12,8,3). The three configurations consider three block sizes: 10√ó10, 14√ó14, 18√ó18, and half overlap rates along the vertical and horizontal directions. These configurations are concatenated to form a 40877 dimensional feature vector for an image of size 150x80. * Transition Local Binary Patterns(tLBP):Trefn√Ω, Jir√≠, and Jir√≠ Matas.\\"Extended set of local binary patterns for rapid object detection.\\" Proceedings of the Computer Vision Winter Workshop.

The neighborhood of a pixel is thus defined in three dimensional space, and volume textons can be extracted into histograms. * RGB-LBP: This operator is obtained by computing LBP over all three channels of the RGB color space independently, and then concatenating the results together.

Another name for this text is Yogapradipadhikara meaning, the Book that Illuminates Meditation. Subject matter Jnanarnava is an important work in Jainism focusing on dhayana (meditation), its techniques and results. But it does not focus only on meditation, but is underpinned by Jain ontology and presents the Jain teachings in the light of Yoga. Subhacandra distinguishes three categories of dhyana‚Äîgood, evil and pure, in conformity with the three types of purposes, viz., the auspicious, the inauspicious and the transcendental. At another place, he classifies dhyana into prasasta (the psychical or psychological view) and aprasasta (practical or ethical view). In addition to this, he also elaborately expounds the process of dhyana by classifying meditation into pindastha (five forms of contemplation or dharmas), padastha (contemplation by means of certain Mantric syllables), rupastha (meditating on the divine qualities and the extraordinary powers of the Arihants) and rupatita (meditation on the attributes of Siddhatman). Besides meditation, this books deals extensively on Jain ethics like Ahimsa, Satya etc. One of the most forceful statement on Ahimsa is found in the Jnanarnava: \\"Violence alone is the gateway to the miserable state, it is also the ocean of sin; it is itself a terrible hell and is surely the densest darkness\\"; and \\"If a person is accustomed to committing injury, then all his virtues like selflessness, greatness, desirelessness, penance, liberality, or munificence are worthless\\" (8.19-20). Contents Jnanarnava is a fairly extensive work and has 39 chapters and 2230 verses. The 39 chapters are: # Pithika (Background) # Dvadasha Bhavana (Twelve Contemplations) # Dhyana Lakshana (Characteristics of Meditation) # Dhyana Guna-Dosha (Virtues and Faults of Meditation) # Yogi Prashamsa (In Praise of the Mendicant) # Darshana Vishuddhi (Purity of Perception) # Jnanopayoga (Focus of Knowledge) # Ahimsa Vrata (Vow of Nonviolence) # Satya Vrata (Vow of Truth) # Caurya Parihara (Avoiding Stealing) # Kama Prakopa (Tumult of Passion) # Stri Svarupa (True Nature of Woman) # Maithuna (Carnal Enjoyment) # Samsarga (Commingling) # Vrdda Seva (Serving the Old) # Parigrahadosha Vicara (Reflecting on the Faults of Attachment to Wealth) # Asha Pishaci (The Demon of Expectation) # Aksha Vishaya Nirodha (Suppressing the Pleasures of the Eye) # Tritattva (The Three Substances) # Mano Vyapara Pratipadana (Conduct of the Mind explained) # Ragadi Nivarana (Riddance of Attachment and Aversion) # Samya Vaibhava (The Power of Equanimity) # Arta Dhyana (Mournful Meditation) # Arta-Raudra (Mournful - Wrathful) # Dhyanaviruddha Sthana (Places detrimental to Meditation) # Pranayama (Control of Breath) # Pratyahara (Withdrawing the Senses) # Savirya Dhyana (Meditation on Oneness with the Supreme Soul) # Shuddhopayoga Vicara (Reflection on the Supreme Meditation) # Ajna Vicaya (Meditation on the Jinas' teachings) # Apaya Vicaya (Meditation on the Destruction of karmas) # Vipaka Vicaya (Meditation on the Fruition of karmas) # Samsthana Vicaya (Meditation on the Structure of the Universe) # Pindastha Dhyana (Meditation on Concrete Objects) # Padastha Dhyana (Meditation on Words) # Rupastha Dhyana (Meditation on the Jinas) # Rupatita Dhyana (Meditation on the Self) # Dharma Dhyana Phala (Fruits of Righteous Meditation) # Shukla Dhyana Phala (Fruits of Meditation of the Pure Self) Authorship and dating Acarya Shubhacandra does not mention his name anywhere in this exhaustive work on meditation. However, the influence of earlier luminaries like Jinabhadra Gani Kshamashramana, Acarya Pujyapada, Acarya Akalanka, Acarya Jinasena, Acarya Amrtacandra, Acarya Somadeva and Acarya Amitagati is clear in this work. In turn, he has influenced the work of Acarya Prabhacandra and Acarya Hemacandra. He may be dated as having lived in the 11th century CE. Shubhacandra was a guru to Gangaraja, general and prime minister to King Bittideva under whose guidance he undertook many acts of piety and religion to advance the cause of Jainism. The Jain religion places a great deal of emphasis on purity of conduct and the ability of the soul to attain liberation through the highest level of meditation. However, there are not that many books on meditation written by the Jains. This automatically places this text in an exclusive category, along with Jinabhadra Gani's Dhyanashataka, Pujyapada's Samadhitantra, Haribhadra's Yogabindu and Yogadrshtisamuccaya, Jinasena's Adipurana, Amitagati's Yogasara Prabhrta and Shravakacara, Gunabhadra's Atmanushasana and Hemacandra's Yogashastra. There is an uncanny resemblance between this text and Hemacandra's ‚ÄòYogashastra‚Äô. Clearly, one has influenced the other. Since Shubhacandra precedes Hemacandra, it is likely that Hemacandra is influenced by Shubhacandra.

He died under mysterious circumstances on November 10, 2009, at the age of 26. Tehran's public prosecutor Abbas Dowlatabadi said Ramin Pourandarjani died of poisoning from a delivery salad laced with an overdose of blood pressure medication. The findings fueled opposition fears that he was killed because of what he knew. Pourandarjani had worked as a physician at the Kahrizak detention center. Iranian authorities earlier had claimed at various points that Pourandarjani had been injured in a car accident, committed suicide, or died of a heart attack in his sleep at the health center at the police headquarters in Tehran where he worked.  Kahrizak doctor  Pourandarjani was responsible for the medical care of several prisoners believed to have been tortured. One of his patients was Mohsen Ruholamini, a government scientist's son, arrested following his participation in the post-election protests. Ruholamini, who was 25 years old, died in prison in July 2009. The death certificate originally identified Ruholamini's cause of death as multiple blows to the head. A report given to judicial authorities stated that Ruholamini had died of \\"physical stress, the effects of being held in bad conditions, multiple blows and severe injuries to the body.\\" Pourandarjani testified before a parliamentary committee investigating misconduct at the Kahrizak jail. This jail was subsequently closed by order of Ayatollah Khamenei, because of the poor conditions there. An investigation was conducted by Iranian judicial authorities on misconduct in this prison. In August, former presidential candidate and cleric Mehdi Karroubi publicly accused Iranian police of having tortured and raped detainees in this prison. Subsequently, police raided Karroubi's office, confiscating names, addresses, and testimonies of witnesses. In October, the deputy chief of the national police, Brig. Gen. Ahmad-Reza Radan announced that ten persons were under investigation for misconduct at the Kahrizak facility, characterizing the issue as \\"minor.\\" Following his testimony, Pourandarjani was arrested by the police. During his imprisonment, Pourandarjani was interrogated several times by the police force's investigative unit, the martial court, and the Physician General's regulatory council. He was released on bail, warned to say nothing about what he had seen at Kahrizak, and threatened with further imprisonment and with losing his medical licence. Following his release, the physician also received threats from unknown persons warning him to keep silent about what he had witnessed at the Kahrizak jail. Shortly prior to his death, Pourandarjani had told his friends that he feared for his safety.  Death  Iranian authorities prohibited Pourandarjani's family from performing an autopsy. Pourandarjani was buried in the northern city of Tabriz, and unusual security measures were in place for his funeral. Iran's judiciary is reluctant to investigate Pourandarjani's death. Pourandarjani was born on June 9, 1983 in Tabriz, Iran. When he was eleven years old, he was admitted to a school for gifted students, and at the age of 13 he was the winner of a national poetry competition. In 2001, he began his medical studies in Ardabil. He later transferred to the medical school at the University of Tabriz, and graduated with distinction in 2008. Pourandarjani was fluent in English and French as well as Persian. Pourandarjani was a co-author on a paper entitled \\"Finasteride induced depression: a prospective study,\\" published in BMC Clinical Pharmacology in October, 2006. This paper concluded that finasteride, which is used to treat benign prostatic enlargement and male pattern baldness, might induce depressive symptoms in patients. At the time, Pourandarjani was doing research at the Drug Applied Research Center at the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in Tabriz, Iran. Pourandarjani also volunteered on a medical advice web page, where he answered questions relating to HIV/AIDS. He was a member of Language improvement committee \\"LIC\\", a student base group volunteering in teaching English to medical students.

Weiner and Junya (Cozy) Yamakoshi, who co-founded Western States Import Co. (WSI) in Canoga Park, California (initially Wil-Go Imports) to design, specify, distribute and market the bicycles. The bikes themselves were manufactured initially in Japan by companies including H. Teams Company of Kobe and later in Taiwan by companies including Merida. The Centurion brand was consolidated with WSI's mountain bike brand Diamond Back in 1990. WSI ceased operations in 2000. Centurion and WSI competed in the U.S. against domestic and European bicycle manufacturers including Schwinn, Raleigh, Peugeot, Gitane and Motobecane -- as well as other nascent Japanese bicycle brands including Miyata, Fuji, Bridgestone, Panasonic, Univega, Lotus and Nishiki -- itself a line of Japanese-manufactured bicycles that were specified, distributed and marketed by West Coast Cycles -- a U.S. company similar to WSI. Japanese-manufactured bikes succeeded in the U.S. market until currency fluctuations in the late 1980s made them less competitive, leading companies to source bicycles from Taiwan. WSI marketed the Centurion brand of road and touring bicycles in the United States using the tag line \\"Where Centurion leads, others must follow\\" and \\"A Lifetime Bicycle\\", offering a warranty without time limit. For a brief period the bikes carried a \\"Centurion Bicycle Works\\" headbadge. The German company Centurion, which still exists, imported Centurion bikes from Japan to Germany from 1976 on and bought the name-rights in 1990. History According to Frank J. Berto, Raleigh Industries of America had been looking at a Japanese source for their Grand Prix model. Raleigh America ordered 2,000 bicycles from Tano and Company of Osaka but their parent company in England, TI-Raleigh, disapproved -- concerned that the Tano-built bikes were too well made and would have outsold their own British bikes. Raleigh's sales agent, Mitchell Weiner, who was reading The New Centurions at the time, took receipt of the bikes, placed Centurion decals on the bikes and marketed them successfully, subsequently forming Western State Imports after merging with Rick Wilson's company, Wil-Go of Santa Clara, California. Because the bikes had all been intended as Raleigh Grand Prix models, as Centurions, they carried the colors of the Raleigh America Grand Prix model. Cozy Yamakoshi served as the company's product development manager, designing the bike's frames, coordinating the manufacture of the bikes by Japanese manufacturers, and importing the bikes into the US. Subsequently, around 1986, Centurion introduced their first Taiwanese built model, the Signet. The Cinelli Equipe Centurion of 1985 (only) was a joint- venture of WSI and Cinelli of Italy. Early bike sales were limited to the West Coast, with the brand receiving wider exposure by the late 1970s. WSI stopped using the Centurion brand name in 1990, consolidating their road and touring bikes under the Diamond Back (later DiamondBack) brand. While the brand Centurion had become well known, under the new brand name the company's market for road and touring bicycles soon evaporated. Early Diamond Back models (ca. 1990) carried a top tube decal reading \\"Centurion Designed\\" and stickers near the bottom bracket reading \\"Designed in the USA\\" and \\"Exclusively built for WSI.\\" Diamondback Bicycles was eventually sold to Raleigh USA, and manufacture was moved to Taiwan. WSI later opened an office in Van Nuys, California, and eventually maintained offices in Dallas, Texas, Denver, Colorado and Dayton, New Jersey -- in addition a headquarters in Newbury Park, California. After Weiner died, the company continued its growth under the management of Mike Bobrick. Cozy Yamakoshi, product and development manager, worked with Mike Bobrick (Executive President of WSI) and Sandy Finkelman (1947‚Äì2005)(Diamond Back team manager and product development) and left Diamond Back in 1986, to start Parkpre Mountain Bike in 1989. Parkpre USA was based in Moorpark, Southern California, USA., producing bikes from the early 1990s until 1998. Ken Yamakoshi, son of Cozy Yamakoshi, is in the process of re-launching Parkpre in the US. The rights to the brand name Centurion were sold to Germany's in 1991. Renner had imported Centurion to Germany since 1976, including made-extra models like the first German mountainbike \\"Country\\". Today, Centurion remains as a German brand with design and engineering in- house. Models Centurion eventually marketed a full line of road and touring bikes, with steel construction ranging from full (all eight tubes) high-tensile 1020 steel at the lower end, to full (all eight tubes) chromoly bikes at their high end -- with top quality componentry. Notable models included:good speedster * Centurion Cinelli Equipe: WSI/Centurion and Cinelli offered the co-branded Centurion Cinelli Equipe for model year 1984/85, as a joint-venture, designed by Cino Cinelli several years after he retired in 1979 and sold Cinelli to the Columbo family, manufacturers of Columbus tubing. The Cinelli Equipe's production was coordinated and supervised by his staff. The bike featured all Cinelli frame components: Columbus SL tubing; chrome chain stay, Cinelli chromed sloped crown, head lugs, bottom bracket shell, handlebars and stem; new-style Cinelli logos embossed on bar and stem, fork crown, seat and seat stays, rear brake bridge and under bottom bracket; Campagnolo dropouts, derraileurs and shifters; Universal 'AER' non-aero brakeset; Ofmega Mistral headset, bottom bracket and crankset; Gipiemme seatpost; Regina chain and CX-S freewheel; Miche \\"Competition\\" hubs and Fiamme, Hard Silver tubular rims. Other markings include a \\"Cinelli Equipe\\" decal on down-tube just above shifters and on left chain stay; an \\"Italia: Made in Italy\\" decal high on seat tube; Columbus tubing decals on fork (\\"Forcella Originale\\") and frame (\\"Acciaio Speciali\\"); Centurion decals on down-tube (left and right), and a Centurion \\"C\\" decal badge on head tube. * Centurion Pro Tour: Richard Ballantine's \\"Richard's Bicycle Book\\" included the Centurion Pro Tour (ultimately manufactured from 1976‚Äì1984) on his list of \\"Best Bikes\\" in both the 1978 and 1982 updates of his book -- along with the Schwinn Paramount P-13, a bike that sold for two to three times the price of the Pro-Tour. Like other full-fledged touring bikes, the Pro Tour models featured a longer wheelbase with longer chainstays for smoother ride especially while loaded, full (all eight tubes) chromoly construction for ride compliance, cantilever brakes to allow room for fenders, internal wiring for a bottom bracket generator and numerous braze-ons: two mounts on the fork for the cantilever brakes, two eyelets in back for a rack and a fender, two eyelets on the fork for a rack and a fender, low rack mounting points on the fork, mounts for two bottle cages, mounts for downtube shifters/cable stops, and seat stay mounts for a rack. Serial Numbers Centurions (except the Cinelli\\\\Centurion) have serial numbers on the underside of the bottom bracket shell. One way to date a Centurion is to try to find date codes on the bike's components. Centurion models manufactured in Japan between 1980-1990 use a serial number format WXYZZZZ with: W = a letter, purpose uncertain, possibly indicates a manufacturer or Centurion; X = a number, indicating the calendar year of manufacture; Y = a letter, indicating the fortnight of manufacture (A = wk 1 & 2, B = wk 3 & 4, etc.) ZZZZ = four digit number, probably indicating frame number during fortnight of manufacture. N4E0283, as an example, would indicate this is the 283rd frame made during the period of weeks 9-10 in 1984. Barring a major components upgrade at some point in a bike's history, one can confirm a bike's age by the dates found on the majority of components in its groupset.

She was one of the primary catalysts for the creation of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). Her actions led to her being called \\"the Founding Mother of the modern Indian repatriation movement\\" and \\"the Rosa Parks of NAGPRA\\".  Activist for repatriation of Native American human remains  In the early 1970s she was appalled that the skeletal remains of Native Americans were treated differently from white remains. Her husband, an engineer with the Iowa Department of Transportation, told her that both Native American and white remains were uncovered during road construction in Glenwood, Iowa. While the remains of 26 white burials were quickly reburied, the remains of a Native American mother and child were sent to a lab for study instead. Pearson protested to Gov. Robert D. Ray, finally gaining an audience with him after sitting outside his office in traditional attire. \\"You can give me back my people's bones and you can quit digging them up\\" she responded when the governor asked what he could do for her. The ensuing controversy led to the passage of the Iowa Burials Protection Act of 1976, the first legislative act in the U.S. that specifically protected Native American remains. Emboldened by her success, Pearson went on to lobby national leaders, and was one of the catalysts for the creation of NAGPRA. Pearson was featured in the 1995 BBC documentary Bones of Contention. Personal Born in Springfield, South Dakota as Darlene Elvira Drappeaux, she was given the Yankton name Hai- Mecha Eunka, which means \\"Running Moccasins\\". Maria was born on July 12, 1932.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a physical phenomenon in which nuclei in a strong constant magnetic field are perturbed by a weak oscillating magnetic field (in the near field) and respond by producing an electromagnetic signal with a frequency characteristic of the magnetic field at the nucleus. This process occurs near resonance, when the oscillation frequency matches the intrinsic frequency of the nuclei, which depends on the strength of the static magnetic field, the chemical environment, and the magnetic properties of the isotope involved; in practical applications with static magnetic fields up to ca. 20 tesla, the frequency is similar to VHF and UHF television broadcasts (60‚Äì1000 MHz). NMR results from specific magnetic properties of certain atomic nuclei. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is widely used to determine the structure of organic molecules in solution and study molecular physics and crystals as well as non-crystalline materials. NMR is also routinely used in advanced medical imaging techniques, such as in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All isotopes that contain an odd number of protons and/or neutrons (see Isotope) have an intrinsic nuclear magnetic moment and angular momentum, in other words a nonzero nuclear spin, while all nuclides with even numbers of both have a total spin of zero. The most commonly used nuclei are and , although isotopes of many other elements can be studied by high-field NMR spectroscopy as well. A key feature of NMR is that the resonance frequency of a particular sample substance is usually directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field. It is this feature that is exploited in imaging techniques; if a sample is placed in a non-uniform magnetic field then the resonance frequencies of the sample's nuclei depend on where in the field they are located. Since the resolution of the imaging technique depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field gradient, many efforts are made to develop increased gradient field strength. The principle of NMR usually involves three sequential steps: *The alignment (polarization) of the magnetic nuclear spins in an applied, constant magnetic field B0. *The perturbation of this alignment of the nuclear spins by a weak oscillating magnetic field, usually referred to as a radio-frequency (RF) pulse. The oscillation frequency required for significant perturbation is dependent upon the static magnetic field (B0) and the nuclei of observation. *The detection of the NMR signal during or after the RF pulse, due to the voltage induced in a detection coil by precession of the nuclear spins around B0. After an RF pulse, precession usually occurs with the nuclei's intrinsic Larmor frequency and, in itself, does not involve transitions between spin states or energy levels. The two magnetic fields are usually chosen to be perpendicular to each other as this maximizes the NMR signal strength. The frequencies of the time-signal response by the total magnetization (M) of the nuclear spins are analyzed in NMR spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. Both use applied magnetic fields (B0) of great strength, often produced by large currents in superconducting coils, in order to achieve dispersion of response frequencies and of very high homogeneity and stability in order to deliver spectral resolution, the details of which are described by chemical shifts, the Zeeman effect, and Knight shifts (in metals). The information provided by NMR can also be increased using hyperpolarization, and/or using two-dimensional, three-dimensional and higher- dimensional techniques. NMR phenomena are also utilized in low-field NMR, NMR spectroscopy and MRI in the Earth's magnetic field (referred to as Earth's field NMR), and in several types of magnetometers. History Nuclear magnetic resonance was first described and measured in molecular beams by Isidor Rabi in 1938, by extending the Stern‚ÄìGerlach experiment, and in 1944, Rabi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.Biography of I. Rabi at Nobelprize.org In 1946, Felix Bloch and Edward Mills Purcell expanded the technique for use on liquids and solids, for which they shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952.1952 Nobel Prize for Physics at Nobelprize.org Yevgeny Zavoisky likely observed nuclear magnetic resonance in 1941, well before Felix Bloch and Edward Mills Purcell, but dismissed the results as not reproducible. Russell H. Varian filed the \\"Method and means for correlating nuclear properties of atoms and magnetic fields\\", on July 24, 1951. Varian Associates developed the first NMR unit called NMR HR-30 in 1952. Purcell had worked on the development of radar during World War II at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Radiation Laboratory. His work during that project on the production and detection of radio frequency power and on the absorption of such RF power by matter laid the foundation for his discovery of NMR in bulk matter. Rabi, Bloch, and Purcell observed that magnetic nuclei, like and , could absorb RF energy when placed in a magnetic field and when the RF was of a frequency specific to the identity of the nuclei. When this absorption occurs, the nucleus is described as being in resonance. Different atomic nuclei within a molecule resonate at different (radio) frequencies for the same magnetic field strength. The observation of such magnetic resonance frequencies of the nuclei present in a molecule allows any trained user to discover essential chemical and structural information about the molecule. The development of NMR as a technique in analytical chemistry and biochemistry parallels the development of electromagnetic technology and advanced electronics and their introduction into civilian use. Theory of nuclear magnetic resonance Nuclear spin and magnets All nucleons, that is neutrons and protons, composing any atomic nucleus, have the intrinsic quantum property of spin, an intrinsic angular momentum analogous to the classical angular momentum of a spinning sphere. The overall spin of the nucleus is determined by the spin quantum number S. If the numbers of both the protons and neutrons in a given nuclide are even then , i.e. there is no overall spin. Then, just as electrons pair up in nondegenerate atomic orbitals, so do even numbers of protons or even numbers of neutrons (both of which are also spin \\\\frac{1}{2} particles and hence fermions), giving zero overall spin. However, a proton and will have lower energy when their spins are parallel, not anti- parallel. This parallel spin alignment of distinguishable particles does not violate the Pauli exclusion principle. The lowering of energy for parallel spins has to do with the quark structure of these two nucleons. As a result, the spin ground state for the deuteron (the nucleus of deuterium, the 2H isotope of hydrogen), which has only a proton and a neutron, corresponds to a spin value of 1, not of zero. On the other hand, because of the Pauli exclusion principle, the tritium isotope of hydrogen must have a pair of anti- parallel spin neutrons (of total spin zero for the neutron-spin pair), plus a proton of spin . Therefore, the tritium total nuclear spin value is again , just like for the simpler, abundant hydrogen isotope, 1H nucleus (the proton). The NMR absorption frequency for tritium is also similar to that of 1H. In many other cases of non-radioactive nuclei, the overall spin is also non-zero. For example, the nucleus has an overall spin value . A non-zero spin \\\\vec{S} is always associated with a non-zero magnetic dipole moment, \\\\vec{\\\\mu} , via the relation \\\\vec{\\\\mu} = \\\\gamma \\\\vec{S} where Œ≥ is the gyromagnetic ratio. Classically, this corresponds to the proportionality between the angular momentum and the magnetic dipole moment of a spinning charged sphere, both of which are vectors parallel to the rotation axis whose length increases proportional to the spinning frequency. It is the magnetic moment and its interaction with magnetic fields that allows the observation of NMR signal associated with transitions between nuclear spin levels during resonant RF irradiation or caused by Larmor precession of the average magnetic moment after resonant irradiation. Nuclides with even numbers of both protons and neutrons have zero nuclear magnetic dipole moment and hence do not exhibit NMR signal. For instance, is an example of a nuclide that produces no NMR signal, whereas , , and are nuclides that do exhibit NMR spectra. The last two nuclei have spin S > 1/2 and are therefore quadrupolar nuclei. Electron spin resonance (ESR) is a related technique in which transitions between electronic rather than nuclear spin levels are detected. The basic principles are similar but the instrumentation, data analysis, and detailed theory are significantly different. Moreover, there is a much smaller number of molecules and materials with unpaired electron spins that exhibit ESR (or electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)) absorption than those that have NMR absorption spectra. On the other hand, ESR has much higher signal per spin than NMR does. Values of spin angular momentum Nuclear spin is an intrinsic angular momentum that is quantized. This means that the magnitude of this angular momentum is quantized (i.e. S can only take on a restricted range of values), and also that the x, y, and z-components of the angular momentum are quantized, being restricted to integer or half-integer multiples of ƒß. The integer or half- integer quantum number associated with the spin component along the z-axis or the applied magnetic field is known as the magnetic quantum number, m, and can take values from +S to ‚àíS, in integer steps. Hence for any given nucleus, there are a total of angular momentum states. The z-component of the angular momentum vector ( \\\\vec{S} ) is therefore , where ƒß is the reduced Planck constant. The z-component of the magnetic moment is simply: : \\\\mu_z = \\\\gamma S_z = \\\\gamma m\\\\hbar. =Spin energy in a magnetic field= Splitting of nuclei spin energies in an external magnetic field An intuitive model. Nuclei with spin have a magnetic moments (spin magnetic moments). By itself, there is no energetic difference for any particular orientation of the nuclear magnet (only one energy state, on the left), but in an external magnetic field there is a high-energy state and a low-energy state depending on the relative orientation of the magnet to the external field, and in thermal equilibrium, the low-energy orientation is preferred. The average orientation of the magnetic moment will precess around the field. The external field can be supplied by a large magnet and also by other nuclei in the vicinity. Consider nuclei with a spin of one-half, like , or . Each nucleus has two linearly independent spin states, with m = or m = ‚àí (also referred to as spin-up and spin-down, or sometimes Œ± and Œ≤ spin states, respectively) for the z-component of spin. In the absence of a magnetic field, these states are degenerate; that is, they have the same energy. Hence the number of nuclei in these two states will be essentially equal at thermal equilibrium. If a nucleus is placed in a magnetic field, however, the two states no longer have the same energy as a result of the interaction between the nuclear magnetic dipole moment and the external magnetic field. The energy of a magnetic dipole moment \\\\vec{\\\\mu} in a magnetic field B0 is given by: : E = -\\\\vec{\\\\mu} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{B}_0 = -\\\\mu_x B_{0x}-\\\\mu_y B_{0y}-\\\\mu_z B_{0z} . Usually the z-axis is chosen to be along B0, and the above expression reduces to: : E = -\\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{z} B_0 \\\\ , or alternatively: : E = -\\\\gamma m\\\\hbar B_0 \\\\ . As a result, the different nuclear spin states have different energies in a non-zero magnetic field. In less formal language, we can talk about the two spin states of a spin as being aligned either with or against the magnetic field. If Œ≥ is positive (true for most isotopes used in NMR) then is the lower energy state. The energy difference between the two states is: :\\\\Delta{E} = \\\\gamma \\\\hbar B_0 \\\\ , and this results in a small population bias favoring the lower energy state in thermal equilibrium. With more spins pointing up than down, a net spin magnetization along the magnetic field B0 results. = Precession of the spin magnetization = A central concept in NMR is the precession of the spin magnetization around the magnetic field at the nucleus, with the angular frequency \\\\omega = -\\\\gamma B where \\\\omega = 2\\\\pi u relates to the oscillation frequency u and B is the magnitude of the field.C. Cohen- Tannoudji, B. Diu, F. Laloe, Quantum Mechanics, Vol. 1, Wiley VCH, 1977. This means that the spin magnetization, which is proportional to the sum of the spin vectors of nuclei in magnetically equivalent sites (the expectation value of the spin vector in quantum mechanics), moves on a cone around the B field. This is analogous to the precessional motion of the axis of a tilted spinning top around the gravitational field. In quantum mechanics, \\\\omega is the Bohr frequency \\\\Delta{E}/\\\\hbar of the S_x and S_y expectation values. Precession of non-equilibrium magnetization in the applied magnetic field B0 occurs with the Larmor frequency \\\\omega_L = 2\\\\pi u_L = -\\\\gamma B_0, without change in the populations of the energy levels because energy is constant (time- independent Hamiltonian).R. P. Feynman, R. B. Leighton, M. Sands, The Feynman Lectures in Physics, Vol. 3. =Magnetic resonance and radio-frequency pulses= A perturbation of nuclear spin orientations from equilibrium will occur only when an oscillating magnetic field is applied whose frequency ŒΩrf sufficiently closely matches the Larmor precession frequency ŒΩL of the nuclear magnetization. The populations of the spin-up and -down energy levels then undergo Rabi oscillations, which are analyzed most easily in terms of precession of the spin magnetization around the effective magnetic field in a reference frame rotating with the frequency ŒΩrf.A. Abragam, The Principles of Nuclear Magnetism, Ch. 2, Oxford Clarendon Press, 1961. The stronger the oscillating field, the faster the Rabi oscillations or the precession around the effective field in the rotating frame. After a certain time on the order of 2‚Äì1000 microseconds, a resonant RF pulse flips the spin magnetization to the transverse plane, i.e. it makes an angle of 90o with the constant magnetic field B0 (\\"90o pulse\\"), while after a twice longer time, the initial magnetization has been inverted (\\"180o pulse\\"). It is the transverse magnetization generated by a resonant oscillating field which is usually detected in NMR, during application of the relatively weak RF field in old- fashioned continuous-wave NMR, or after the relatively strong RF pulse in modern pulsed NMR. =Chemical shielding= It might appear from the above that all nuclei of the same nuclide (and hence the same Œ≥) would resonate at exactly the same frequency. This is not the case. The most important perturbation of the NMR frequency for applications of NMR is the \\"shielding\\" effect of the surrounding shells of electrons.Principle of Shielding and Deshielding . NMRCentral.com (August 2011) Electrons, similar to the nucleus, are also charged and rotate with a spin to produce a magnetic field opposite to the applied magnetic field. In general, this electronic shielding reduces the magnetic field at the nucleus (which is what determines the NMR frequency). As a result, the frequency required to achieve resonance is also reduced. This shift in the NMR frequency due to the electronic molecular orbital coupling to the external magnetic field is called chemical shift, and it explains why NMR is able to probe the chemical structure of molecules, which depends on the electron density distribution in the corresponding molecular orbitals. If a nucleus in a specific chemical group is shielded to a higher degree by a higher electron density of its surrounding molecular orbital, then its NMR frequency will be shifted \\"upfield\\" (that is, a lower chemical shift), whereas if it is less shielded by such surrounding electron density, then its NMR frequency will be shifted \\"downfield\\" (that is, a higher chemical shift). Unless the local symmetry of such molecular orbitals is very high (leading to \\"isotropic\\" shift), the shielding effect will depend on the orientation of the molecule with respect to the external field (B0). In solid- state NMR spectroscopy, magic angle spinning is required to average out this orientation dependence in order to obtain frequency values at the average or isotropic chemical shifts. This is unnecessary in conventional NMR investigations of molecules in solution, since rapid \\"molecular tumbling\\" averages out the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA). In this case, the \\"average\\" chemical shift (ACS) or isotropic chemical shift is often simply referred to as the chemical shift. Relaxation Visualization of the T1 and T2 relaxation times. The process of population relaxation refers to nuclear spins that return to thermodynamic equilibrium in the magnet. This process is also called T1, \\"spin-lattice\\" or \\"longitudinal magnetic\\" relaxation, where T1 refers to the mean time for an individual nucleus to return to its thermal equilibrium state of the spins. After the nuclear spin population has relaxed, it can be probed again, since it is in the initial, equilibrium (mixed) state. The precessing nuclei can also fall out of alignment with each other and gradually stop producing a signal. This is called T2 or transverse relaxation. Because of the difference in the actual relaxation mechanisms involved (for example, intermolecular versus intramolecular magnetic dipole-dipole interactions ), T1 is usually (except in rare cases) longer than T2 (that is, slower spin-lattice relaxation, for example because of smaller dipole-dipole interaction effects). In practice, the value of T2* which is the actually observed decay time of the observed NMR signal, or free induction decay (to of the initial amplitude immediately after the resonant RF pulse), also depends on the static magnetic field inhomogeneity, which is quite significant. (There is also a smaller but significant contribution to the observed FID shortening from the RF inhomogeneity of the resonant pulse). In the corresponding FT-NMR spectrum‚Äîmeaning the Fourier transform of the free induction decay‚Äîthe T2* time is inversely related to the width of the NMR signal in frequency units. Thus, a nucleus with a long T2 relaxation time gives rise to a very sharp NMR peak in the FT-NMR spectrum for a very homogeneous (\\"well-shimmed\\") static magnetic field, whereas nuclei with shorter T2 values give rise to broad FT- NMR peaks even when the magnet is shimmed well. Both T1 and T2 depend on the rate of molecular motions as well as the gyromagnetic ratios of both the resonating and their strongly interacting, next-neighbor nuclei that are not at resonance. A Hahn echo decay experiment can be used to measure the dephasing time, as shown in the animation below. The size of the echo is recorded for different spacings of the two pulses. This reveals the decoherence which is not refocused by the 180¬∞ pulse. In simple cases, an exponential decay is measured which is described by the T2 time. Image:GWM HahnEchoDecay.gif NMR spectroscopy T NMR Magnet at HWB-NMR, Birmingham, UK NMR spectroscopy is one of the principal techniques used to obtain physical, chemical, electronic and structural information about molecules due to the chemical shift of the resonance frequencies of the nuclear spins in the sample. Peak splittings due to J- or dipolar couplings between nuclei are also useful. NMR spectroscopy can provide detailed and quantitative information on the functional groups, topology, dynamics and three-dimensional structure of molecules in solution and the solid state. Since the area under an NMR peak is usually proportional to the number of spins involved, peak integrals can be used to determine composition quantitatively. Structure and molecular dynamics can be studied (with or without \\"magic angle\\" spinning (MAS)) by NMR of quadrupolar nuclei (that is, with spin ) even in the presence of magnetic \\"dipole-dipole\\" interaction broadening (or simply, dipolar broadening) which is always much smaller than the quadrupolar interaction strength because it is a magnetic vs. an electric interaction effect. Additional structural and chemical information may be obtained by performing double-quantum NMR experiments for pairs of spins or quadrupolar nuclei such as . Furthermore, nuclear magnetic resonance is one of the techniques that has been used to design quantum automata, and also build elementary quantum computers.Quantum automaton and quantum computation (see also references therein) Continuous- wave (CW) spectroscopy In the first few decades of nuclear magnetic resonance, spectrometers used a technique known as continuous-wave (CW) spectroscopy, where the transverse spin magnetization generated by a weak oscillating magnetic field is recorded as a function of the oscillation frequency or static field strength B0. When the oscillation frequency matches the nuclear resonance frequency, the transverse magnetization is maximized and a peak is observed in the spectrum. Although NMR spectra could be, and have been, obtained using a fixed constant magnetic field and sweeping the frequency of the oscillating magnetic field, it was more convenient to use a fixed frequency source and vary the current (and hence magnetic field) in an electromagnet to observe the resonant absorption signals. This is the origin of the counterintuitive, but still common, \\"high field\\" and \\"low field\\" terminology for low frequency and high frequency regions, respectively, of the NMR spectrum. As of 1996, CW instruments were still used for routine work because the older instruments were cheaper to maintain and operate, often operating at 60 MHz with correspondingly weaker (non-superconducting) electromagnets cooled with water rather than liquid helium. One radio coil operated continuously, sweeping through a range of frequencies, while another orthogonal coil, designed not to receive radiation from the transmitter, received signals from nuclei that reoriented in solution. As of 2014, low-end refurbished 60 MHz and 90 MHz systems were sold as FT-NMR instruments, and in 2010 the \\"average workhorse\\" NMR instrument was configured for 300 MHz. CW spectroscopy is inefficient in comparison with Fourier analysis techniques (see below) since it probes the NMR response at individual frequencies or field strengths in succession. Since the NMR signal is intrinsically weak, the observed spectrum suffers from a poor signal-to-noise ratio. This can be mitigated by signal averaging, i.e. adding the spectra from repeated measurements. While the NMR signal is the same in each scan and so adds linearly, the random noise adds more slowly ‚Äì proportional to the square root of the number of spectra (see random walk). Hence the overall signal-to-noise ratio increases as the square-root of the number of spectra measured. Fourier-transform spectroscopy Most applications of NMR involve full NMR spectra, that is, the intensity of the NMR signal as a function of frequency. Early attempts to acquire the NMR spectrum more efficiently than simple CW methods involved illuminating the target simultaneously with more than one frequency. A revolution in NMR occurred when short radio-frequency pulses began to be used, with a frequency centered at the middle of the NMR spectrum. In simple terms, a short pulse of a given \\"carrier\\" frequency \\"contains\\" a range of frequencies centered about the carrier frequency, with the range of excitation (bandwidth) being inversely proportional to the pulse duration, i.e. the Fourier transform of a short pulse contains contributions from all the frequencies in the neighborhood of the principal frequency. The restricted range of the NMR frequencies made it relatively easy to use short (1 - 100 microsecond) radio frequency pulses to excite the entire NMR spectrum. Applying such a pulse to a set of nuclear spins simultaneously excites all the single-quantum NMR transitions. In terms of the net magnetization vector, this corresponds to tilting the magnetization vector away from its equilibrium position (aligned along the external magnetic field). The out-of-equilibrium magnetization vector then precesses about the external magnetic field vector at the NMR frequency of the spins. This oscillating magnetization vector induces a voltage in a nearby pickup coil, creating an electrical signal oscillating at the NMR frequency. This signal is known as the free induction decay (FID), and it contains the sum of the NMR responses from all the excited spins. In order to obtain the frequency-domain NMR spectrum (NMR absorption intensity vs. NMR frequency) this time-domain signal (intensity vs. time) must be Fourier transformed. Fortunately, the development of Fourier transform (FT) NMR coincided with the development of digital computers and the digital Fast Fourier Transform. Fourier methods can be applied to many types of spectroscopy. (See the full article on Fourier transform spectroscopy.) Richard R. Ernst was one of the pioneers of pulsed NMR and won a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1991 for his work on Fourier Transform NMR and his development of multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy The use of pulses of different durations, frequencies, or shapes in specifically designed patterns or pulse sequences allows the NMR spectroscopist to extract many different types of information about the molecules in the sample. In multi-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, there are at least two pulses and, as the experiment is repeated, the pulse timings are systematically varied and the oscillations of the spin system are probed point by point in the time domain. Multidimensional Fourier transformation of the multidimensional time signal yields the multidimensional spectrum. In two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance there will be one systematically varied time period in the sequence of pulses, which will modulate the intensity or phase of the detected signals. In 3D NMR, two time periods will be varied independently, and in 4D NMR, three will be varied. The remaining \\"dimension\\" is always provided by the directly detected signal. There are many such experiments. In some, fixed time intervals allow (among other things) magnetization transfer between nuclei and, therefore, the detection of the kinds of nuclear-nuclear interactions that allowed for the magnetization transfer. Interactions that can be detected are usually classified into two kinds. There are through-bond and through-space interactions, the latter being a consequence of dipolar couplings in solid- state NMR and of the nuclear Overhauser effect in solution NMR. Experiments of the nuclear Overhauser variety may be employed to establish distances between atoms, as for example by 2D-FT NMR of molecules in solution. Although the fundamental concept of 2D-FT NMR was proposed by Jean Jeener from the Free University of Brussels at an international conference, this idea was largely developed by Richard Ernst who won the 1991 Nobel prize in Chemistry for his work in FT NMR, including multi-dimensional FT NMR, and especially 2D-FT NMR of small molecules.\\"Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Fourier Transform Spectroscopy\\" Ernst's Nobel lecture. (Includes mention of Jeener's suggestion.) Multi- dimensional FT NMR experiments were then further developed into powerful methodologies for studying molecules in solution, in particular for the determination of the structure of biopolymers such as proteins or even small nucleic acids. In 2002 Kurt W√ºthrich shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (with John Bennett Fenn and Koichi Tanaka) for his work with protein FT NMR in solution. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy This technique complements X-ray crystallography in that it is frequently applicable to molecules in an amorphous or liquid-crystalline state, whereas crystallography, as the name implies, is performed on molecules in a crystalline phase. In electronically conductive materials, the Knight shift of the resonance frequency can provide information on the mobile charge carriers. Though nuclear magnetic resonance is used to study the structure of solids, extensive atomic-level structural detail is more challenging to obtain in the solid state. Due to broadening by chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) and dipolar couplings to other nuclear spins, without special techniques such as MAS or dipolar decoupling by RF pulses, the observed spectrum is often only a broad Gaussian band for non-quadrupolar spins in a solid. Professor Raymond Andrew at the University of Nottingham in the UK pioneered the development of high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. He was the first to report the introduction of the MAS (magic angle sample spinning; MASS) technique that allowed him to achieve spectral resolution in solids sufficient to distinguish between chemical groups with either different chemical shifts or distinct Knight shifts. In MASS, the sample is spun at several kilohertz around an axis that makes the so-called magic angle Œ∏m (which is ~54.74¬∞, where 3cos2Œ∏m-1 = 0) with respect to the direction of the static magnetic field B0; as a result of such magic angle sample spinning, the broad chemical shift anisotropy bands are averaged to their corresponding average (isotropic) chemical shift values. Correct alignment of the sample rotation axis as close as possible to Œ∏m is essential for cancelling out the chemical-shift anisotropy broadening. There are different angles for the sample spinning relative to the applied field for the averaging of electric quadrupole interactions and paramagnetic interactions, correspondingly ~30.6¬∞ and ~70.1¬∞. In amorphous materials, residual line broadening remains since each segment is in a slightly different environment, therefore exhibiting a slightly different NMR frequency. Dipolar and J-couplings to nearby 1H nuclei are usually removed by radio-frequency pulses applied at the 1H frequency during signal detection. The concept of cross polarization developed by Sven Hartmann and Erwin Hahn was utilized in transferring magnetization from protons to less sensitive nuclei by M.G. Gibby, Alex Pines and John S. Waugh. Then, Jake Schaefer and Ed Stejskal demonstrated the powerful use of cross polarization under MAS conditions (CP- MAS) and proton decoupling, which is now routinely employed to measure high resolution spectra of low-abundance and low-sensitivity nuclei, such as carbon-13, silicon-29, or nitrogen-15, in solids. Significant further signal enhancement can be achieved by dynamic nuclear polarization from unpaired electrons to the nuclei, usually at temperatures near 110 K. Sensitivity Because the intensity of nuclear magnetic resonance signals and, hence, the sensitivity of the technique depends on the strength of the magnetic field the technique has also advanced over the decades with the development of more powerful magnets. Advances made in audio-visual technology have also improved the signal-generation and processing capabilities of newer instruments. As noted above, the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance signals is also dependent on the presence of a magnetically susceptible nuclide and, therefore, either on the natural abundance of such nuclides or on the ability of the experimentalist to artificially enrich the molecules, under study, with such nuclides. The most abundant naturally occurring isotopes of hydrogen and phosphorus (for example) are both magnetically susceptible and readily useful for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In contrast, carbon and nitrogen have useful isotopes but which occur only in very low natural abundance. Other limitations on sensitivity arise from the quantum-mechanical nature of the phenomenon. For quantum states separated by energy equivalent to radio frequencies, thermal energy from the environment causes the populations of the states to be close to equal. Since incoming radiation is equally likely to cause stimulated emission (a transition from the upper to the lower state) as absorption, the NMR effect depends on an excess of nuclei in the lower states. Several factors can reduce sensitivity, including: *Increasing temperature, which evens out the population of states. Conversely, low temperature NMR can sometimes yield better results than room-temperature NMR, providing the sample remains liquid. *Saturation of the sample with energy applied at the resonant radiofrequency. This manifests in both CW and pulsed NMR; in the first case (CW) this happens by using too much continuous power that keeps the upper spin levels completely populated; in the second case (pulsed), each pulse (that is at least a 90¬∞ pulse) leaves the sample saturated, and four to five times the (longitudinal) relaxation time (5T1) must pass before the next pulse or pulse sequence can be applied. For single pulse experiments, shorter RF pulses that tip the magnetization by less than 90¬∞ can be used, which loses some intensity of the signal, but allows for shorter recycle delays. The optimum there is called an Ernst angle, after the Nobel laureate. Especially in solid state NMR, or in samples containing very few nuclei with spin (diamond with the natural 1% of carbon-13 is especially troublesome here) the longitudinal relaxation times can be on the range of hours, while for proton-NMR they are more in the range of one second. *Non-magnetic effects, such as electric- quadrupole coupling of spin-1 and spin- nuclei with their local environment, which broaden and weaken absorption peaks. , an abundant spin-1 nucleus, is difficult to study for this reason. High resolution NMR instead probes molecules using the rarer isotope, which has spin-. Isotopes Many isotopes of chemical elements can be used for NMR analysis.Multinuclear NMR Commonly used nuclei: *, the most commonly used spin- nucleus in NMR investigation, has been studied using many forms of NMR. Hydrogen is highly abundant, especially in biological systems. It is the nucleus most sensitive to NMR signal (apart from which is not commonly used due to its instability and radioactivity). Proton NMR produces narrow chemical shift with sharp signals. Fast acquisition of quantitative results (peak integrals in stoichiometric ratio) is possible due to short relaxation time. The signal has been the sole diagnostic nucleus used for clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). *, a spin 1 nucleus commonly utilized as signal-free medium in the form of deuterated solvents during proton NMR, to avoid signal interference from hydrogen-containing solvents in measurement of solutes. Also used in determining the behavior of lipids in lipid membranes and other solids or liquid crystals as it is a relatively non-perturbing label which can selectively replace . Alternatively, can be detected in media specially labeled with . Deuterium resonance is commonly used in high-resolution NMR spectroscopy to monitor drifts in the magnetic field strength (lock) and to improve the homogeneity of the external magnetic field. *, is very sensitive to NMR. There is a very low percentage in natural helium, and subsequently has to be purified from . It is used mainly in studies of endohedral fullerenes, where its chemical inertness is beneficial to ascertaining the structure of the entrapping fullerene. *, more sensitive than , yields sharper signals. The nuclear spin of 10B is 3 and that of 11B is . Quartz tubes must be used because borosilicate glass interferes with measurement. * spin-, is widely used, despite its relative paucity in naturally occurring carbon (approximately 1.1%). It is stable to nuclear decay. Since there is a low percentage in natural carbon, spectrum acquisition on samples which have not been experimentally enriched in takes a long time. Frequently used for labeling of compounds in synthetic and metabolic studies. Has low sensitivity and moderately wide chemical shift range, yields sharp signals. Low percentage makes it useful by preventing spin-spin couplings and makes the spectrum appear less crowded. Slow relaxation means that spectra are not integrable unless long acquisition times are used. *, spin-1, medium sensitivity nucleus with wide chemical shift. Its large quadrupole moment interferes in acquisition of high resolution spectra, limiting usefulness to smaller molecules and functional groups with a high degree of symmetry such as the headgroups of lipids. *, spin-, relatively commonly used. Can be used for labeling compounds. Nucleus very insensitive but yields sharp signals. Low percentage in natural nitrogen together with low sensitivity requires high concentrations or expensive isotope enrichment. *, spin-, low sensitivity and very low natural abundance (0.037%), wide chemical shift range (up to 2000 ppm). Quadrupole moment causing line broadening. Used in metabolic and biochemical studies in studies of chemical equilibria. *, spin-, relatively commonly measured. Sensitive, yields sharp signals, has a wide chemical shift range. *, spin-, 100% of natural phosphorus. Medium sensitivity, wide chemical shifts range, yields sharp lines. Spectra tend to have a moderate amount of noise. Used in biochemical studies and in coordination chemistry where phosphorus containing ligands are involved. * and , broad signal. is significantly more sensitive, preferred over despite its slightly broader signal. Organic chlorides yield very broad signals. Its use is limited to inorganic and ionic chlorides and very small organic molecules. *, used in biochemistry to study calcium binding to DNA, proteins, etc. Moderately sensitive, very low natural abundance. *, used in studies of catalysts and complexes. Other nuclei (usually used in the studies of their complexes and chemical bonding, or to detect presence of the element): *,   , , , *,  , ,    , Applications NMR is extensively used in medicine in the form of magnetic resonance imaging. NMR is used industrially mainly for routine analysis of chemicals. The technique is also used, for example, to measure the ratio between water and fat in foods, monitor the flow of corrosive fluids in pipes, or to study molecular structures such as catalysts. Medicine Medical MRI The application of nuclear magnetic resonance best known to the general public is magnetic resonance imaging for medical diagnosis and magnetic resonance microscopy in research settings. However, it is also widely used in biochemical studies, notably in NMR spectroscopy such as proton NMR, carbon-13 NMR, deuterium NMR and phosphorus-31 NMR. Biochemical information can also be obtained from living tissue (e.g. human brain tumors) with the technique known as in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy or chemical shift NMR microscopy. These spectroscopic studies are possible because nuclei are surrounded by orbiting electrons, which are charged particles that generate small, local magnetic fields that add to or subtract from the external magnetic field, and so will partially shield the nuclei. The amount of shielding depends on the exact local environment. For example, a hydrogen bonded to an oxygen will be shielded differently from a hydrogen bonded to a carbon atom. In addition, two hydrogen nuclei can interact via a process known as spin-spin coupling, if they are on the same molecule, which will split the lines of the spectra in a recognizable way. As one of the two major spectroscopic techniques used in metabolomics, NMR is used to generate metabolic fingerprints from biological fluids to obtain information about disease states or toxic insults. Chemistry By studying the peaks of nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, chemists can determine the structure of many compounds. It can be a very selective technique, distinguishing among many atoms within a molecule or collection of molecules of the same type but which differ only in terms of their local chemical environment. NMR spectroscopy is used to unambiguously identify known and novel compounds, and as such, is usually required by scientific journals for identity confirmation of synthesized new compounds. See the articles on carbon-13 NMR and proton NMR for detailed discussions. A chemist can determine the identity of a compound by comparing the observed nuclear precession frequencies to known frequencies. Further structural data can be elucidated by observing spin-spin coupling, a process by which the precession frequency of a nucleus can be influenced by the spin orientation of a chemically bonded nucleus. Spin-spin coupling is easily observed in NMR of hydrogen-1 ( NMR) since its natural abundance is nearly 100%. Because the nuclear magnetic resonance timescale is rather slow, compared to other spectroscopic methods, changing the temperature of a T2* experiment can also give information about fast reactions, such as the Cope rearrangement or about structural dynamics, such as ring-flipping in cyclohexane. At low enough temperatures, a distinction can be made between the axial and equatorial hydrogens in cyclohexane. An example of nuclear magnetic resonance being used in the determination of a structure is that of buckminsterfullerene (often called \\"buckyballs\\", composition C60). This now famous form of carbon has 60 carbon atoms forming a sphere. The carbon atoms are all in identical environments and so should see the same internal H field. Unfortunately, buckminsterfullerene contains no hydrogen and so nuclear magnetic resonance has to be used. spectra require longer acquisition times since carbon-13 is not the common isotope of carbon (unlike hydrogen, where is the common isotope). However, in 1990 the spectrum was obtained by R. Taylor and co- workers at the University of Sussex and was found to contain a single peak, confirming the unusual structure of buckminsterfullerene. Purity determination (w/w NMR) While NMR is primarily used for structural determination, it can also be used for purity determination, provided that the structure and molecular weight of the compound is known. This technique requires the use of an internal standard of known purity. Typically this standard will have a high molecular weight to facilitate accurate weighing, but relatively few protons so as to give a clear peak for later integration e.g. 1,2,4,5-tetrachloro-3-nitrobenzene. Accurately weighed portions of the standard and sample are combined and analysed by NMR. Suitable peaks from both compounds are selected and the purity of the sample is determined via the following equation. :\\\\mathrm{Purity} = \\\\frac{w_\\\\mathrm{std} \\\\times n[\\\\mathrm{H}]_\\\\mathrm{std} \\\\times MW_\\\\mathrm{spl}}{w_\\\\mathrm{spl} \\\\times MW_\\\\mathrm{std} \\\\times n[\\\\mathrm{H}]_\\\\mathrm{spl}} \\\\times P Where: *wstd: weight of internal standard *wspl: weight of sample *n[H]std: the integrated area of the peak selected for comparison in the standard, corrected for the number of protons in that functional group *n[H]spl: the integrated area of the peak selected for comparison in the sample, corrected for the number of protons in that functional group *MWstd: molecular weight of standard *MWspl: molecular weight of sample *P: purity of internal standard Non-destructive testing Nuclear magnetic resonance is extremely useful for analyzing samples non-destructively. Radio-frequency magnetic fields easily penetrate many types of matter and anything that is not highly conductive or inherently ferromagnetic. For example, various expensive biological samples, such as nucleic acids, including RNA and DNA, or proteins, can be studied using nuclear magnetic resonance for weeks or months before using destructive biochemical experiments. This also makes nuclear magnetic resonance a good choice for analyzing dangerous samples. Segmental and molecular motions In addition to providing static information on molecules by determining their 3D structures, one of the remarkable advantages of NMR over X-ray crystallography is that it can be used to obtain important dynamic information. This is due to the orientation dependence of the chemical-shift, dipole-coupling, or electric-quadrupole-coupling contributions to the instantaneous NMR frequency in an anisotropic molecular environment.K. Schmidt-Rohr, H. W. Spiess, Multidimensional Solid-State NMR and Polymers, Ch. 2, Academic Press, 1994. When the molecule or segment containing the NMR- observed nucleus changes its orientation relative to the external field, the NMR frequency changes, which can result in changes in one- or two-dimensional spectra or in the relaxation times, depending of the correlation time and amplitude of the motion. Data acquisition in the petroleum industry Another use for nuclear magnetic resonance is data acquisition in the petroleum industry for petroleum and natural gas exploration and recovery. Initial research in this domain began in the 1950s, however, the first commercial instruments were not released until the early 1990s. A borehole is drilled into rock and sedimentary strata into which nuclear magnetic resonance logging equipment is lowered. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of these boreholes is used to measure rock porosity, estimate permeability from pore size distribution and identify pore fluids (water, oil and gas). These instruments are typically low field NMR spectrometers. NMR logging, a subcategory of electromagnetic logging, measures the induced magnet moment of hydrogen nuclei (protons) contained within the fluid-filled pore space of porous media (reservoir rocks). Unlike conventional logging measurements (e.g., acoustic, density, neutron, and resistivity), which respond to both the rock matrix and fluid properties and are strongly dependent on mineralogy, NMR-logging measurements respond to the presence of hydrogen. Because hydrogen atoms primarily occur in pore fluids, NMR effectively responds to the volume, composition, viscosity, and distribution of these fluids, for example oil, gas or water. NMR logs provide information about the quantities of fluids present, the properties of these fluids, and the sizes of the pores containing these fluids. From this information, it is possible to infer or estimate: * The volume (porosity) and distribution (permeability) of the rock pore space * Rock composition * Type and quantity of fluid hydrocarbons * Hydrocarbon producibility The basic core and log measurement is the T2 decay, presented as a distribution of T2 amplitudes versus time at each sample depth, typically from 0.3 ms to 3 s. The T2 decay is further processed to give the total pore volume (the total porosity) and pore volumes within different ranges of T2. The most common volumes are the bound fluid and free fluid. A permeability estimate is made using a transform such as the Timur-Coates or SDR permeability transforms. By running the log with different acquisition parameters, direct hydrocarbon typing and enhanced diffusion are possible. Flow probes for NMR spectroscopy Recently, real-time applications of NMR in liquid media have been developed using specifically designed flow probes (flow cell assemblies) which can replace standard tube probes. This has enabled techniques that can incorporate the use of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or other continuous flow sample introduction devices. Process control NMR has now entered the arena of real-time process control and process optimization in oil refineries and petrochemical plants. Two different types of NMR analysis are utilized to provide real time analysis of feeds and products in order to control and optimize unit operations. Time- domain NMR (TD-NMR) spectrometers operating at low field (2‚Äì20 MHz for ) yield free induction decay data that can be used to determine absolute hydrogen content values, rheological information, and component composition. These spectrometers are used in mining, polymer production, cosmetics and food manufacturing as well as coal analysis. High resolution FT-NMR spectrometers operating in the 60 MHz range with shielded permanent magnet systems yield high resolution NMR spectra of refinery and petrochemical streams. The variation observed in these spectra with changing physical and chemical properties is modeled using chemometrics to yield predictions on unknown samples. The prediction results are provided to control systems via analogue or digital outputs from the spectrometer. Earth's field NMR In the Earth's magnetic field, NMR frequencies are in the audio frequency range, or the very low frequency and ultra low frequency bands of the radio frequency spectrum. Earth's field NMR (EFNMR) is typically stimulated by applying a relatively strong dc magnetic field pulse to the sample and, after the end of the pulse, analyzing the resulting low frequency alternating magnetic field that occurs in the Earth's magnetic field due to free induction decay (FID). These effects are exploited in some types of magnetometers, EFNMR spectrometers, and MRI imagers. Their inexpensive portable nature makes these instruments valuable for field use and for teaching the principles of NMR and MRI. An important feature of EFNMR spectrometry compared with high-field NMR is that some aspects of molecular structure can be observed more clearly at low fields and low frequencies, whereas other aspects observable at high fields are not observable at low fields. This is because: * Electron-mediated heteronuclear J-couplings (spin-spin couplings) are field independent, producing clusters of two or more frequencies separated by several Hz, which are more easily observed in a fundamental resonance of about 2 kHz.\\"Indeed it appears that enhanced resolution is possible due to the long spin relaxation times and high field homogeneity which prevail in EFNMR.\\" * Chemical shifts of several ppm are clearly separated in high field NMR spectra, but have separations of only a few millihertz at proton EFNMR frequencies, so are usually not resolved. Zero field NMR In zero field NMR all magnetic fields are shielded such that magnetic fields below 1 nT (nanotesla) are achieved and the nuclear precession frequencies of all nuclei are close to zero and indistinguishable. Under those circumstances the observed spectra are no-longer dictated by chemical shifts but primarily by J-coupling interactions which are independent of the external magnetic field. Since inductive detection schemes are not sensitive at very low frequencies, on the order of the J-couplings (typically between 0 and 1000 Hz), alternative detection schemes are used. Specifically, sensitive magnetometers turn out to be good detectors for zero field NMR. A zero magnetic field environment does not provide any polarization hence it is the combination of zero field NMR with hyperpolarization schemes that makes zero field NMR attractive. Quantum computing NMR quantum computing uses the spin states of nuclei within molecules as qubits. NMR differs from other implementations of quantum computers in that it uses an ensemble of systems; in this case, molecules. Magnetometers Various magnetometers use NMR effects to measure magnetic fields, including proton precession magnetometers (PPM) (also known as proton magnetometers), and Overhauser magnetometers.

Today it is a point of interest of numerous visitors and a branch of the Gda≈Ñsk History Museum.  History  The name was taken from the very popular medieval legend of King Arthur - a symbol of chivalry and gallantry. First in England, then in other European countries, his name was given to the houses where knights and aristocrats used to meet. In Poland Artus courts were founded and visited by bourgeoisie. There were several courts in Rzeczpospolita but the one in Gda≈Ñsk was by far the most famous. In the early 14th century Artus Courts existed in the Hanseatic towns of Elbing (ElblƒÖg), Riga and Stralsund and similar courts like the House of the Blackheads at Riga and Tallinn. It was home to six fraternities which took their names from benches (Banken), the Reinhold's, St. Christopher's or L√ºbecker, Marienburger, Biblical Magi's, Counsillors' and the Dutch bench. These Confraternities were usually organized according to the merchant's or shipowner's trade relations, e.g. with L√ºbeck, the Netherlands or Poland and gathered the local elite - members of aristocracy and wealthy bourgeoisie. Already in 1492 merchants from England were allowed to appear at the Court. The entrance was banned for craftsmen, stall-keepers and hired workers. Wealthy merchants and visitors from abroad gathered here in the evenings. They paid for beverages in advance: 3 Schillings in the 17th century. Initially, at least in theory, talking about dealings was forbidden in the Court as the yard in front of it was designated for such purposes. Different performances took place in the evenings - musicians, singers, rope-dancers and jugglers came to amuse the visitors. Although they were officially banned, gambling, dice and card games as well as various bets were very popular. Normally only beverages and small snacks were served, but sometimes big feasts, which lasted even for a couple of days, were organized there. Especially at the end of the 17th century the feasts organized with great splendour began to turn into all-night drinking bouts. More and more complaints about the customs in the Court were made. The great tiled heating stove in Artus Court. However, not only social meetings took place in the Court. In the 17th century librarians presenting books printed in Danzig appeared there, as well as painters with their art; the banning order for other tradesmen did not apply to them. The heyday of the Artus Court falls into 16th and 17th century, but its history is much longer. The name of the building \\"curia regis Artus\\" (The Court of King Artus), which was built in the years 1348-1350, appeared for the first time in 1357 in the municipal note about the land rental from 1350. Another building was probably built in 1379. Its traces were probably found during the archeological excavations in 1991.cf. Gda≈Ñsk wczesno≈õredniowieczny w ≈õwietle najnowszych bada≈Ñ archeologicznych i historycznych, Gda≈Ñsk 1998, p. 200 This building of the Court burnt down in 1476. It was reconstructed few years later, and in 1552 a new fa√ßade was constructed which was once more rebuilt in 1617 by Abraham van den Blocke in the style of Dutch Mannerism. The building was adorned with statues of antique heroes (Scipio Africanus, Themistocles, Marcus Furius Camillus and Judas Maccabeus), allegories of strength and justice above and the statue of Fortuna on the gable. Medallions with busts of King of Poland Sigismund III Vasa and his son W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa, who was a prince at that time, were placed on each side of the portal. Throughout the Lutheran Reformation the Reinhold's bench organized an anti-Catholic carnival play in 1522, which was staged inside the court.  The interior of the Court  The interior of the Court. The interior is one big Gothic hall. Since 1531 it has been completely redecorated - the walls have been covered with wainscot and friezes of mythological and historical character. The richly ornamented furniture and numerous paintings add to the splendour of the hall. The most famous ones are, among others, the works by anonymous artists from the late 15th century - Siege of Marienburg, The Ship of the Church, Orpheus among animals by Hans Vredeman de Vries from 1596 and Last Judgment by Anton M√∂ller. The last painting caused much controversy, as the artist has used the scenery of the city and depicted some significant figures of the period as allegorical characters, such as Pride or Faithlessness. The hall was decorated not only with paintings but also tapestries, ship models, armours, coats of arms, or a cage with exotic birds. The other interesting decoration is the 11-metre high furnace made by Georg Stelzner between 1545-1546. It is covered with 520 tileshttp://www.lonelyplanet.com/poland/pomerania/gdansk/sights/museums- galleries/artus-court-museum depicting the greatest European leaders, both the Protestants - supporters of the Schmalkaldic League, and the Catholics, among which are portraits of Isabella of Portugal and Charles V. The Artus Court was designed as an exclusive meeting venue for the local elite. Only in 1742, at the request of the town's mercantile companies, the Council agreed to change the Court into the town's stock exchange and the city lost its most famous inn.

Artus Court was seriously damaged during the East Pomeranian Offensive of the Red Army in 1945, but it was rebuilt after the war. A vast part of the equipment, including the furnace, were reconstructed with the use of materials hidden from the city before the front moved into Gda≈Ñsk. The building was entered into the register of monuments on 25 February 1967. On the front wall of the Court there is a memorial board from 1965 commemorating the 20th anniversary of placing the Polish flag on the Artus Court by the soldiers of the 1st Armoured Brigade. Currently the interior of the Artus Court is open for visitors - there is also the department of the Gda≈Ñsk History Museum.  Bibliography  * Maria Bogucka, ≈ªyƒá w dawnym Gda≈Ñsku.

As seen through a night vision device, United States Army Sergeant Andrew Burch and an Afghan soldier scan a tree line for militants during Operation Champion Sword. Night combat is combat that occurs during the hours of darkness. It is distinguished from daytime combat by lower visibility and its reversed relation to the Circadian cycle. Typically combat at night is favorable to the attacker, with offensive tactics being focused on exploiting the advantages to maximum effect.NIGHT COMBAT BY RUSSIAN CAVALRYNight Combat Defensive night tactics mainly focus on negating the advantages given by the night to the attacker.Night Combat Operations Effects of night The most obvious effect of darkness is reduced visibility. This affects a soldier's ability to observe friendly troop movements, understand terrain, and especially affects perception of enemy movements and position. Officers find that darkness hampers many aspects of command, including their ability to preserve control, execute movement, firing, maintenance of direction, reconnaissance, security, and mutual support. A U.S. Army report on the history of Japanese warfare described an instance of this confusion: > An example is recorded in the history of Japan when about 1180 a force [sic] > of the Heike confronting a force of the Genji across the Fuji river > (Shizuoka Prefecture) beat a hasty retreat one night due to mistaking the > noise made by water fowl for an attacking Genji force. Indeed, a side effect of the reduced visibility is heightened audibility, as soldiers focus more on what they can hear. There are many instances of soldiers losing their bearings at night due to flashes from guns or enemy searchlights.Eight United States Army Military History Section: Japanese Research Division The difficulties of perception lend themselves to fear of the unknown. Soldiers under fire can't tell where the fire originates and can't devise appropriate countermeasures. Such uncertainty is associated with feelings of loneliness and helplessness, and creates a tendency to overestimate enemy strength or be excessively pessimistic of the combat situation. In addition, without the aid of artificial illumination, a soldier's marksmanship skills are negatively affected in total darkness. According to a report by Jean L. Dyer, Seward Smith and Nancy R. McClure, History Night operations have been subject to vast shifts in effectiveness and frequency throughout history, as tactics and technology became more sophisticated. Classical antiquity Night fighting between standing armies was rare in ancient times. Night logistics were mostly limited to the carrying of torches, or navigation by what little light was provided by the stars or moon. However, circumstances occasionally necessitated fighting at night. Usually due to the massive nature of the battles, they could not be resolved in one day, and combat could not be cleanly disengaged as darkness fell, or prevented as armies camped near each other overnight. Sieges which lasted for weeks, months or, even years were often fought day and night. Below are a few notable examples. Ancient historian Diodorus claims that at the Battle of Thermopylae the Spartans attempted to assassinate Persian King Xerxes by infiltrating his camp at night. > \\"They immediately seized their arms, and six hundred men rushed into the > camp of five hundred thousand, making directly for the king's tent, and > resolving either to die with him, or, if they should be overpowered, at > least in his quarters. An alarm spread through the whole Persian army. The > Spartans being unable to find the king, marched uncontrolled through the > whole camp, killing and overthrowing all that stood in their way, like men > who knew that they fought, not with the hope of victory, but to avenge their > own deaths. The contest was protracted from the beginning of the night > through the greater part of the following day. At last, not conquered, but > exhausted with conquering, they fell amidst vast heaps of slaughtered > enemies.\\"Diodorus on the Battle of Thermopylae At the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, over a period of 3 days, an alliance of Germanic tribes wore down and eventually annihilated 3 Roman legions (about 16,000 to 20,000 men). The Romans attempted several defensive night tactics. On the first night they managed to erect a fortified camp. On the second night, they marched at night in an attempt to break through the encircling Germanic forces, but the Germans had already built a wall in their way, and when combat resumed the following day, the Romans were defeated. The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains saw exceptional chaos caused by nightfall. The night before the battle proper, one of the Roman allied forces stumbled on a band of Hunnic troops and in the resulting skirmish, as many as 30,000 (unverified) men were killed. Later in the battle, Thorismund, son of king Theodoric, accidentally walked into Attila the Hun's encampment while attempting to return to his own forces at night. He was wounded in the ensuing m√™l√©e before his followers could rescue him and withdraw. That same night, the Roman commander Flavius A√´tius became separated from his men and, believing that disaster had befallen them, had to stay the night with his Germanic allies. Middle Ages The Night Attack of T√¢rgovi≈üte pitted Vlad The Impaler of Wallachia against Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire. Vlad reportedly disguised himself as a Turk and walked freely throughout the Ottoman camp in an effort to find Mehmed's tent and learn about the organization of his army. One chronicle of the battle says that Mehmed disallowed his troops to exit their tents so as not to cause a panic in case of an attack. According to that chronicle, Vlad learned of this and planned his attack at night knowing that the enemy soldiers would have to remain in their tents. Accounts of the battle and its casualties are mixed, but in the end it was a Wallachian victory, with around 5000 Wallachian casualties compared to around 15,000 for the Ottomans. World War I The adoption of illumination rounds led to an improvement in the ability to carry out night operations. These projectiles were fired from howitzers and field guns in the direction their light was required. The first illumination rounds (also called starshell) were modified shrapnel shells which ejected magnesium pellets. These were somewhat ineffective, and were soon replaced by improved designs that had greater candle power, and a parachute to prolong the descent to ground. Tracer ammunition was also introduced during World War I. Tracers made marksmanship at night easier for soldiers, because they could observe the trajectory of their shots and correct their aim accordingly. World War II Night continued to have a significant impact on combat during World War II. Particularly in the Pacific Theater, the Japanese military was proficient in night warfare, as acknowledged by the Allies. In anticipation of a conflict with the Soviet Union, whose numbers of tanks, planes, and artillery were vastly superior, the Japanese developed a series of training manuals designed to counter these advantages. The \\"Red Books\\" (classified materials bound in red paper) emphasized the advantages of attacking at night, in the evening, and at dawn. These tactics later proved useful against the other Allies who were similarly better equipped. The Japanese used this advantage to win engagements where they were severely outnumbered in China and against the Allies at sea. It wasn't until late in the war that early warning technologies of the Allies subverted their surprise attacks at night, reducing their effectiveness. These tactics completely broke down once the Japanese military replaced their well trained troops with hastily trained recruits. The USS Enterprise (CV-6) was the first aircraft carrier in the U.S. Navy that carried out night strike operations. It received the new designation (CV(N)-6), the \\"N\\" standing for \\"Night\\", to indicate this capability. Another type of illumination device was the tripflare. This consisted of a pyrotechnic instrument activated by a tripwire, which was planted near trails to provide early warning of enemy movement. By 1944, the Wehrmacht was making extensive use of tripflares in Italy, after their perimeters had been repeatedly infiltrated at night by U.S. Army Rangers. Tripflares helped foil an attack launched by the Fifth Army on January 20 at the Rapido Rivers. Post-World War II In the First Battle of al-Faw in late stages of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, one of the elements contributed to the success of Iranians was their using of dug in infantry which would move only at night and during poor weather, which reduced the Iraqis' advantage in armor. The Iranian forces had been trained in night warfare prior to the battle. Tactics Perhaps the most important deciding factor in a battle at night is preparation. This includes training, reconnaissance, and planning. As with any military operation, leadership is important in both the high-ranking officers and the low-level squad and unit leaders. Offensive tactics The decision to engage at night or continue an engagement at night is usually made by the attacking force. Combat continued at night is aimed at exploiting an advantage gained from an attack during the day or similarly denying the defending force the opportunity to regroup or reinforce. Combat initiated at night can either be aimed to gain an advantage (such as territory or prisoners) which is then held during the following day or to harass and demoralize the enemy before disengaging prior to sunrise. The latter case is considered a raid. Historically, night combat involves greater risk and reward compared to similar battles in the day time. Victories can be crushing, with the defending side taken completely by surprise and hardly a shot fired in response to an attack. Alternatively, defeats can be disastrous with huge casualties resulting from attacking armies floundering around chaotically while they themselves are ambushed in pitch darkness.

Life He was the younger son of William Tracy, a noted Lutheran convert, graduated B.A. at Oxford on 27 June 1515, and was admitted student of the Inner Temple in 1519. In 1529 he was elected to the ‚Äòreformation‚Äô parliament as member for Wotton Basset, Wiltshire. For the next few years he was engaged in the struggle over his father's will. In February 1533 he was granted Stanway, a manor belonging to Tewkesbury Abbey, which he made the home of his family. He adopted his father's religious views, and appears to have written a short treatise by 1533. In 1535 Tracy's works were classed as dangerous with those of Luther, Melanchthon, William Tyndale, and John Frith. In 1537 Tracy had been placed on the commission of the peace for Gloucestershire, and employed in work connected with the visitation of the monasteries in his shire. In 1538 he was nominated for the shrievalty, but Henry VIII preferred Robert Acton, and in December 1539 he was appointed one of the squires to attend at the reception of Anne of Cleves. His reforming zeal led his friend and neighbour Hugh Latimer to express a wish that there were many more like him. With Thomas Cromwell's fall Tracy lost favour at court, and on 7 July 1546 his books were ordered to be burnt. In 1548 he was appointed, under the act for the abolition of chantries, one of the commissioners of inquiry for Gloucestershire. In May 1551 he was imprisoned in the Tower for a letter, probably an attack on Warwick's government. He was released on 17 November 1552. On 9 June 1555 his religious views brought him under the notice of Queen Mary's council, but he cleared himself. On 19 September following, however, he again appeared on a charge of having behaved stubbornly towards the Bishop of Gloucester, and in January 1557 he was in trouble for refusing to pay a forced loan. After Elizabeth's accession Tracy served as High Sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1560‚Äì61, and in 1565 wrote a protest to William Cecil against the queen's retaining a crucifix in her chapel. Works Probably his ‚ÄòProfe and Declaration of thys Proposition: Fayth only iustifieth‚Äô, dedicated to Henry VIII, but with no date, place, or printer's name, was Tracy's earliest work. It was followed in 1544 by ‚ÄòA Supplycation to our most Soueraigne Lorde, Kynge Henry the Eyght.‚Äô In November 1548, during the discussions in convocation and parliament which preceded the issue of Edward VI's first Book of Common Prayer, Tracy published ‚ÄòA Bryef and short Declaracyon made wherebye euery Chrysten Man may knowe what is a Sacrament,‚Äô London. He quotes largely from Augustine of Hippo. Besides these, Tracy is said to have written ‚ÄòThe Preparation to the Crosse and to Death .... in two bookes,‚Äô 1540. This treatise, bound up with two by John Frith, was found in a cod's belly in Cambridge market in 1626 (see Vox Piscis), and was reprinted in that year by Boler and Milbourne. Richard Tracy was rumoured to be a playable character (a kickboxer) in the first Mortal Kombat game as an unlockable secret character. It was later revealed as a creation of Electronic Gaming Monthly as part of an April Fool's Day joke. Family By his wife Barbara, daughter of Sir Thomas Lucy (died 1525), Tracy had issue three sons and three daughters. The eldest surviving son, Paul Tracy of Stanway, was created a baronet in 1626. In 1543 Bartholomew Traheron, who had been educated at Tracy's expense and was called his son, dedicated to him his translation of John of Vigo's Surgery.

This non-profit organisation has, at present, 28 member organisations and one observer members from EU member states, representing around one million young farmers. Its office is located in Brussels. CEJA  History  CEJA was founded in Rome, Italy in 1958. Through a series of bilateral contacts, organisations representing young farmers from the six initial members of the EEC set up a European organisation of young farmers in order to concentrate their action at the European level and to concretely participate in the realisation of European integration. To this end, a \\"Comit√© d‚ÄôEntente\\" was set up, which was later renamed the \\"European Council of Young Farmers\\".  Overview  CEJA does not defend nor depend on any political ideology and gathers a broad spectrum of young farmers and rural youth members. It is an international organisation governed by a General Assembly and a Presidium, CEJA‚Äôs main decision making bodies, as well as a Presidency which is made up of one President and four Vice-Presidents of different nationalities, elected for a two-year term. Apart from providing services to its members, CEJA stays in regular contact with young farmers‚Äô organisations and agricultural institutions and associations throughout Europe and worldwide. CEJA also has strong links with different international youth organisations. At the Brussels level, partners include the European Rural Coalition and COPA COGECA. At the international level, the organisation will work closely with the World Farmers Organisation, the United Nations‚Äô Food and Agriculture Organization and Rural Youth Europe, for example. CEJA‚Äôs main objectives according to their website are to ease the installation of young farmers in Europe, to inform, train and represent them, to act as a platform for communication between young farmers and to make European citizens aware of farming-related issues. CEJA maintains contact with European institutions, European decision-makers as well as organisations dealing with agriculture and takes part in 18 Agricultural Advisory Groups of the European Commission. CEJA acts as a forum for exchange and dialogue between young farmers and European decision makers. One of CEJA‚Äôs most important tasks is to explain the Common Agricultural Policy, its reforms and adjustments, and to show how the two pillars of the CAP assist young farmers in rural areas to manage the structural changes in Europe‚Äôs agricultural sector.  Seminars and Events  CEJA participates at events around Europe related to youth and agriculture. Every year it holds seminars in conjunction with other member organisations, the European Commission and national governments, normally during each Presidency of the European Union. For example, the European Congress of Young Farmers held in February and September 2010 in Seville, Spain and Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium. CEJA also holds events at the European Parliament and in collaboration with other EU institutions, such as the public hearing on generational renewal in agriculture in April 2011.  Situation of Young Farmers in Europe  CEJA highlights the situation that young farmers face in Europe such as their high installation costs and their difficult access to land and credit. CEJA also raises the negative demographic trend in European agriculture. Currently only 6% of farmers in Europe are under the age of 35 while conversely over 30% of farmers are over the age of 65. The European Parliament recognised in its report on the Future of the CAP after 2013 in July 2010 that there was an urgent need to attract young generations to the agricultural sector in Europe and that policies such as favourable loans for credit and investment should be considered. Moreover, the European Commission in its Communication on the CAP2020 of November 2010 cited the \\"specific needs of young farmers will be a priority,\\" in the upcoming CAP reform.  CEJA proposals  CEJA cites generational renewal in the agricultural sector as priority. To combat generational decline and prioritise young farmers CEJA calls for a Young Farmers Package of policy measures to be included in the CAP post 2013 reform.

It is too faint to view with the naked eye, having an apparent visual magnitude that varies from 12.2 down to 16.1. The star is located approximately 447 light years away from the Sun based on parallax, and is drifting further away with a radial velocity of +17 km/s. The stellar classification for this object is K7Ve, matching a K-type main-sequence star that displays emission features. It is an eruptive variable of the T Tauri type with an estimated age of 2.4 million years. The object has 76% of the mass of the Sun, 181% of the Sun's radius, and is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 13 km/s. AA Tauri is radiating 80% of the luminosity of the Sun at an effective temperature of 4,060 K.  Variability  AA Tauri shows brightness variations of one to two magnitudes over an 8.2-day period. The brightness has been described as \\"roughly constant, interrupted by quasi-cyclic fading episodes\\". The periodic variations are ascribed to eclipses of the star by a warped dust disk around it. In 2011, AA Tauri faded by about two magnitudes and has remained at the fainter level since then. The star also became significantly more reddened. The eight-day variations continue, with a maximum brightness now around magnitude 14 and magnitude 16.5 at its faintest. It is theorised that the root cause of this dimness is a warp in the accretion disk, located at a distance of 7.7 AU or more from the centre, that was brought into the line of sight by its elliptical motion around the central star. A possible planetary system In their paper of 2003, Grinin et al. invoke the possible presence of a substellar object to explain peculiar and periodic eclipses occurring to the young star every 8.3 days. They infer a mass of 20 times that of Jupiter for the perturbing object and an orbital separation of 0.08 Astronomical Units. Later studies find no evidence for a planet, instead finding multiple rings with accretion streams between them.

The brick church is dedicated to St. Pancras and today serves parishioners of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands. History Hooglandse Kerk around 1900 (picture by Jan Goedeljee) The Bishop of Utrecht ordered the construction of a wooden chapel on December 20, 1314. By 1377 the population and economic prosperity of Leiden called for a larger structure, and construction began on the current structure. The sanctuary was finished in 1391 and the ambulatory in 1415.  Chapel  The history of the Hooglandse Kerk began when the bishop of Utrecht, Gwijde of Avesnes, granted permission on 20 December 1314 for the construction of a wooden chapel on the 'Hooge Land' (High Land) as an annex of the parish church of Leiderdorp. The chapel was dedicated to the sacred Pancratius (‚Ä† ca 300). A few decades later, this chapel is replaced by a simple stone church with a turret, but with Leiden's strong economic growth, the need for a much larger church is already increasing quite rapidly.  Chapter Church  On October 29, 1366, the bishop of Utrecht, John of Virneburg, raised the church to chapter church. The canons that belonged to the collegiate chapter of Saint Pancras were predominantly derived from ancient families and mostly of nobility. The new status gave rise to plans for a great cross church, which must surpass the Pieterskerk in all respects. In 1377 the construction of a grand church began, starting with the choir (1391) and the ambulatory (1415). The first phase of the southern transept began with the construction of the Holy Cross Chapel (1436). The mention of the Our Lady Chapel in an agreement between the chapter and the church master's college from 1448 is the first clue for the construction of the northern transept. Between 1420 and 1436 the entrance portals would be established. The aisles were expanded between 1432 and 1456. The chapter suffered from a shortage of money, due in part to disappointing income from the individual prebends. Money deprivation, the dependence of the Leiden city of the wool trade and the high taxes imposed by Holland's warring counts also demanded their toll. Despite the continuing delay, the ambitious project continued. Around 1500, the wide transept had its current form. It is the longest gothic transept in the Netherlands with a length of 65.70 meters.  Cathedral  On the advocacy of Charles the Bold, Pope Paul II granted the chapter of Saint Pancras' exemption on February 24, 1470. As a result, the chapter no longer fell under the jurisdiction of the diocese of Utrecht, but under the direct authority of the pope. This seems favorable to the chapter: around 1525 the authorities in the Netherlands planned to elevate the St. Pancras church to cathedral status. Leiden would become a bishop's seat and the collegiate chapter would be elevated to a cathedral chapter. However, restless times were underway: tensions arose within the chapter and the influence of the Reformation increased. The construction of the St Pancras church would end in 1535. At the episcopal reorganization of 1559, the intended bishop's seat eventually fell to the Grote or Sint-Bavokerk in Haarlem. The extension and elevation of the nave, the stone vaults, air bows and balustrades were no longer completed. In the first half of the 16th century the church was elaborately decorated. The church has 24 altars, with a prominent place on the northeastern pillar for the altar dedicated to its patronage Saint Pancras.  Reformation  During the iconoclasm of August 1566 numerous religious artifacts and archives were destroyed. From 1572 the church was left in Protestant hands, and in times of need it also served as a grain store, such as during Leiden's siege in 1574. Of the original Catholic dressings, almost nothing remains.  17th century - present  In the 17th century the Hooglandse Kerk fulfilled an important religious and social role in Leiden. From this period date the portals, the banks in the aisles, the pulpit, the organ, many grave stones and the houses on the outside of the church. By the middle of the 19th century, the church was dilapidated, partly as a result of the explosion of a gunpowder ship in 1807. Even the demolition of the church was considered. This was not the case, and from 1840 to 1903 the church was well restored under the guidance of architects J.C. Rijk and W.C. Mulder. Part of the work was on the vault of the nave (1840) and the beautiful wooden vaults in the choir and the transept (1850) that give a good impression of the original spatial effect. In addition, the choir gate was removed from the high choir. After the Second World War, one again decided on a major restoration, which was carried out from 1952 to 1972. Later, on a smaller scale, restoration work took place, which means that the church is in a good state today. The Hooglandse Kerk still has a church function. The Protestant Church in the Netherlands (PKN) and the Ecumenical Leiden Students Ekklesia hold their worship every Sunday. It is also the venue of conferences, concerts and other events.

He was a colonial administrator and naturalist, but also a true-life adventurer. He has been described as a \\"brilliant fisherman and naturalist, a gallant soldier and fine writer of English, an explorer, colonial administrator and man of business.\\" Early life Buchan was born in London the son of Baron Tweedsmuir and Susan Grosvenor. He was educated at Eton and in 1930 he went to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he graduated with a fourth class degree in History. While at Brasenose College he was an active member of the Brasenose College Boat Club, and rowed in the College's 1st Torpid. As an undergraduate, he was also a close friend of John Gorton. Buchan subsequently went on to study at the Dundee School of Economics. Military career After a period in the Colonial Administrative Service in Uganda he contracted dysentery and was forced to leave Africa on health grounds. He went to join his parents in Canada in 1936. Here he joined the Hudson's Bay Company. He drove a dog-sled 3000 miles and spent the winter of 1938/9 at the remote Cape Dorset in Baffinland.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-lord- tweedsmuir-1338173.html In September 1939 at the onset of war, he joined the Governor General's Foot Guards in Canada, and was with the first Canadian troopship to reach England in December 1939. In February 1940 his father died and he became Baron Tweedsmuir. In 1941 he saw active service with the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment (with whom he started as second in command), ultimately in Sicily for which he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1946 New Year Honours. Farley Mowat, who served as an infantryman in the HPE Regiment, described Tweedsmuir as a soldier, newly in command (due to his predecessor, Bruce Sutcliff, having been killed). Mowat's account is in his war memoir, \\"And No Birds Sang\\" (1975, 2003). The task was to take Assoro, an ancient, and well-fortified, promontory blocking the regiment's advance. \\"Barely thirty years of age, soft-spoken, kindly, with a slight tendency to stutter, he was a tall fair-haired English romantic out of another age . . . his famous father's perhaps. 'Tweedie,' as we called him behind his back, had as a youth sought high adventure [in the Arctic, the African veldt, Canada]. But until this hour real adventure in the grand tradition had eluded him. Going forward on his own reconnaissance that afternoon in company with the new second-in-command, Major 'Ack Ack' Kennedy, Tweedsmuir looked up at the towering colossus of Assoro with the visionary eye of a Lawrence of Arabia, and saw that the only way to accomplish the impossible was to attempt the impossible. He thereupon decided that the battalion would make a right flank march by night across the intervening trackless gullies to the foot of the great cliff, scale that precipitous wall and, just at dawn, take the summit by surprise.\\" The operation succeeded. Tweedsmuir was later wounded in Sicily. He was twice Mentioned in Dispatches. Scientific career He led scientific expeditions to Libya and St Ninians Island and was 21 years President of the British Schools Exploring Society. He was promoted to be a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1964. Later life In later life he lived in Kingston House at Kingston Bagpuize in rural Oxfordshire. He returned to Scotland for the final two months of his life and died in a small cottage in North Berwick. He had no male heir, so upon his death the barony passed to his younger brother. Family He married Priscilla Grant, widow of Sir Arthur Grant of Monymusk. She died of cancer in 1978.

The Six plus Two Group on Afghanistan (also known as 6 plus 2 Contact Group or \\"6 plus 2\\") describes an informal coalition of the six nations bordering with Afghanistan (China, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan), plus the United States and Russia, which functioned from 1997 to 2001 under the aegis of the United Nations. The coalition worked to find a peaceful solution that would have included the participation of the Afghan Northern Alliance. Later it explored the issue of a post-Taliban government for Afghanistan.  Countries involved   History  Following the Afghan Civil War, by 1996 the Taliban controlled most of Afghanistan, governing as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Fighting continued between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance, prompting international attention. This diplomatic initiative was proposed by Islam Karimov, the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, keeping in mind that the conflict in Afghanistan cannot be resolved by use of force and a peaceful political dialogue is needed. The idea was first discussed during meeting of Islam Karimov with UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy on Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi in August 1997. It was underlined that the peaceful settlement of the conflict would not be achieved without involvement of neighbouring states. The objective of the Group was to find a solution to the Afghan problem, to assist in the establishment of a broadly representative and multi-ethnic Afghan government.  Meetings under 6+2 initiative  Within the framework of the 6+2 initiative a number of important meetings and conferences were held in the UN Headquarters in New York, in the Uzbek capital Tashkent and other venues. On 19 July 1999, the Group adopted the so-called Tashkent Declaration (\\"On Fundamental Principles for a Peaceful Settlement of the Conflict in Afghanistan\\").Tashkent Declaration on Fundamental Principles for a Peaceful Settlement of the Conflict in Afghanistan - UN Peacemaker Website In the declaration, the parties agreed not to provide military support to any Afghan party and to prevent the use of their territories for such purposes. Just a week following the adoption of the Declaration, the Taliban launched a military offensive, which was condemned in a UN Security Council statement. UN Security Council SC/6743 of 22 October 1999 On 8 February 2000 at United Nations Headquarters was held a High-level Meeting of \\"Six Plus Two\\" Group at the level of Permanent Representatives and above, which aimed at discussion of illicit production and distribution of drugs from Afghanistan.

SSETI Express (SSETI being the acronym for Student Space Exploration and Technology Initiative) is a small spacecraft, similar in size and shape to a washing machine. On board the student-built spacecraft were three CubeSat pico-satellites, extremely small satellites weighing around one kg each. These were deployed one hour and forty minutes after launch. 23 university groups, working from locations spread across Europe and with very different cultural backgrounds, worked together via the internet to jointly create the satellite. The expected lifetime of the mission was planned to be 2 months. Express is the fastest developed micro-satellite in history. Pico-satellites The three pico- satellites on board the spacecraft were: * XI-V from Japan, University of Tokyo Its primary mission is the demonstration of newly developed solar cells in space. Other mission objectives include the acquisition of Earth images by a commercial off-the-shelf digital camera and the operation of a message transmission service using an amateur radio frequency. * UWE-1 from Germany, University of W√ºrzburg The main objective of UWE-1, (University of W√ºrzburg's Experimental satellite 1) is to conduct telecommunication experiments related to the optimisation of an internet-related infrastructure for space applications. * Ncube-2 from Norway, And√∏ya Rocket Range This contains an automated identification system (AIS) used to receive GPS signals. The AIS signals from Ncube II are detected and forwarded to Ncube ground stations, allowing them to track the satellite. Purpose The purpose of Express is to take pictures of the Earth, act as a test-bed and technology demonstrator for ESEO hardware, and also function as a radio transponder for the global amateur radio community. It is a pilot project for the SSETI student community and a demonstration of how ESA experts can support student initiatives. As well as this, it is meant to be an inspiration for other educational satellite programmes, but also a logistical precursor to the future SSETI micro- satellite projects.

It operates in South Africa as well as two other African countries and exports a number of its brands globally. The company's core business is the production, distribution, marketing and selling of a diverse range of food, beverages and related products. The group employs approximately 8600 permanent employees. The Pioneer Foods brand portfolio includes Bokomo cereals, Liqui-Fruit, Ceres Fruit Juice, SASKO bread, Safari dried fruit, Spekko and White Star maize.  History  It was created following the merger of two other South African packaged goods companies (SASKO and Bokomo) in 1997. SASKO was renamed Essential Foods while Bokomo Foods and Ceres Beverages were consolidated into a single management structure as Groceries. The international portfolio is a well-established division boasting long-standing relationships in core export markets. The division manages in-county breakfast cereals and fruit snacking operations in the UK. It was listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (\\"JSE\\") in 2008 under the ticker PFG. In 2010 Pioneer Foods was fined R195 million by the South African Competition Commission for colluding with other bread producers to raise the price of bread by between 30c and 35c per loaf in 2007. This fine reflected roughly 10% of Pioneer owned Sasko's 2006 turnover in bread sales. According to the commission South Africa's four largest milling companies collectively controlling over 90 percent of the local flour market were involved in colluding with each other. The four firms (Premier Foods, Tiger Brands, Foodcorp and Pioneer Foods facilitated their pricing activities through secret meetings and telephone calls between employees of these firms at various venues, including churches, stadiums and hotels. The commission found that these price-fixing activities had a negative effect on both consumers as a whole as well as preventing smaller bakeries from being effective competitors.MoneyWeb: \\"Watchdog refers wheat milling cartel to Tribunal\\", 15 March 2010 Quantum Foods was unbundled from Pioneer Foods in October 2014 and is listed as a separate entity on the JSE. In 2016, Pioneer gained a 49% stake in the cereal brand Weetabix in East Africa, which included a partnership with Weetabix UK. A subsidiary of Pioneer Foods, Pioneer Foods UK, in December 2017 bought UK-based granola brand, Lizi‚Äôs, from The GoodCarb Food Company for an undisclosed price. The purchase was reportedly in line with Pioneer Foods' strategic plan to acquire companies in geographies and categories where they have an existing presence. In May 2018, Pioneer Foods received approval from the Competition Tribunal to buy the outstanding 50.1% of Heinz South Africa, that it didn't already own, on condition that the deal did not lead to significant job losses. The acquisition was effective 1 June 2018, and makes the Heinz SA operation a wholly owned subsidiary. This deal adds the well-known brands of Wellington's, Mama's Pies, Today, and John West to the Pioneer Foods basket of brands.

Each package of downloadable content adds new missions, new locales to visit, and new items for the player to make use of. Of the five, Broken Steel has the largest effect on the game, altering the ending, increasing the level cap to 30, and allowing the player to continue playing past the end of the main quest line. The Game of The Year edition of Fallout 3 includes the full game and all five pieces of downloadable content. The downloadable content was originally only to Xbox Live and Games for Windows. Although Bethesda had not offered an explanation as to why the content was not released for PlayStation 3, Lazard Capital Markets analyst Colin Sebastian speculated that it may have been the result of a money deal with Bethesda by Sony's competitor, Microsoft. When asked if the PlayStation 3 version would receive an update that would enable gameplay beyond the main quest's completion, Todd Howard responded, \\"Not at this time, no\\". However, in May 2009, Bethesda announced that the existing DLC packs (Operation: Anchorage, The Pitt and Broken Steel) would be made available for the PlayStation 3; the later two (Point Lookout and Mothership Zeta) were released for all platforms. Operation: Anchorage Operation: Anchorage is the first Fallout 3 downloadable content pack, and takes place as a virtual reality \\"military simulation\\" in the main game where the player character is stripped of their equipment and is forced to use the replacements provided. The content focuses on the titular event in Fallouts alternate history. Before the Great War, the United States Army liberated Anchorage, Alaska from Chinese forces. The pack contains several new quests, new items, and adds four new achievements. Gameplay within the simulation is different than the main game; health and ammo are replenished by stations in certain areas of the simulation world, items functionally do not suffer from decay, and enemy corpses disappear instead of allowing the player to loot them for supplies. Operation: Anchorage was released in North America and Europe on January 27, 2009 on Xbox Live and Games for Windows Live. Although the content was scheduled for release on the PlayStation 3 in June 2009, the final week of June's PlayStation Store updates did not include it. Bethesda released information suggesting that the delay was due to their desire to iron out all of the bugs before release as well as test compatibility between DLCs. Operation: Anchorage, along with The Pitt, were released on October 1, 2009, for PS3. Plot The Brotherhood of Steel Outcasts are trying to acquire a stash of pre-war technology in a bunker near the metro. However, the armory can only be unlocked with a code, and the code can only be obtained from a virtual reality simulation of one of the greatest battles of the Fallout universe: the liberation of Anchorage, Alaska from invading Chinese troops. The Outcasts cannot use the simulation because an external interface device, the player's Pip-Boy, is required. The player is recruited to complete the simulation in return for a share of the reward. In the simulation, the player is tasked with fighting the Chinese in various scenarios, such as clearing out bunkers in a cliff, hitting strategic targets, and finally defeating the Chinese general in single combat. Once the simulation is complete, the player gains access to the armory and the advanced weapons it contains. Upon opening the door and took their rewards, the Lone Wanderer witness an argument between Outcast Commander McGraw and Defender Sibley who refused the former for sharing the equipment to the Wanderer. The player could saved McGraw or leave him to die at the hands of Sibley. Reception Both the PC and the Xbox 360 version of the Operation: Anchorage DLC received mixed reviews from critics, averaging a 67 and a 69 respectively at Metacritic. Several reviewers criticized the price of Operation: Anchorage for being too expensive for the content provided. Play.tm's Richard Bright and other reviewers were disappointed overall, with Bright stating \\"this episode was a little disappointing for me personally.\\" Game Over's Phil Soletsky was particularly critical of the expansion's story, saying \\"I had been hoping that the liberation of Alaska would be a massive affair involving battalions of soldiers hammering away at each other.\\" IGN's Erik Brudvig gave high praise to the new weapon, the gauss rifle, calling it \\"freakin' awesome\\". Reviewers also criticized the shift to a focus on action gameplay, instead of the more varied gameplay that Fallout 3 had. The Pitt The Pitt is the second downloadable content pack. It allows the player to journey to the industrial raider town known as The Pitt, in the remains of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The pack features several new weapons, new armor and clothing items, four achievements and around four to five hours of gameplay. The Pitt was released on March 24, 2009 on Xbox Live and Games for Windows Live, but was quickly removed due to glitches in the gameplay which made the Xbox 360 version of the expansion unplayable. Further investigation was performed by Bethesda and Microsoft, and on March 25, 2009, the expansion was again uploaded to Xbox Live, and was made available again that afternoon. For those who downloaded it on March 24 in the morning, glitches were still apparent. A new version was available on Xbox Live on April 2, fixing freezing issues many players had encountered with the previous version. A retail disk was released at the end of May 2009 containing this and the Operation: Anchorage downloadable content. It was released for Xbox 360 and Games for Windows. The downloadable content is copied to the hard drive and functions as it would have had it been downloaded. This pack was released for the PlayStation 3 at the same time as Operation Anchorage on October 1, 2009. Plot \\"Welcome to The Pitt\\". Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, although not hit directly by atomic bombs during the Great War, was afflicted by the highly irradiated water of the nearby Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio rivers, resulting in the decay of the region. The inhabitants suffer from extreme radiation poisoning and degenerate into mindless creatures. The entire population are either slaves or overseers. Some 30 years before the Lone Wanderer started their journey, Owyn Lyons led the Brotherhood of Steel's expedition to Washington, D.C. through The Pitt. In one night, the Brotherhood swept through and destroyed the raider force occupying the town and rid the surrounding area of other \\"scum\\", killing anything that put up a fight. This event is chronicled as \\"the Scourge\\". As they cut through the raiders, the Brotherhood saved several young children, among them Paladin Kodiak, who had not yet been mutated to the extent of The Pitt's adult inhabitants. All the rescued children were brought into the Brotherhood of Steel as initiates. Paladin Kodiak is the only remaining survivor from that group of rescued children that is still stationed at the Citadel. The Lone Wanderer learns of the Pitt by a man named Wernher from a distress broadcast, who asks for the Wanderer's help in liberating the slaves there. The player has to enter the Pitt as a slave and work their way to freedom. This earns a meeting with the Pitt's leader, Lord Ashur, a former Brotherhood soldier left for dead during the Scourge. The player is then given the choice of siding with either Wernher or Ashur. Unlike other decisions in Fallout 3, there is no karmic penalty or reward for choosing either side, as each side has both its good and bad points. Reception The Pitt received generally positive reviews, averaging a score of 77 for the PC version and 76 for the Xbox 360 version. When initially released, the Xbox 360 version had a corrupt file which caused problems and rendered the DLC unplayable. On April 3, 2009, Bethesda Softworks reported that they had uploaded a new version of The Pitt which fixed these problems. The PC version of The Pitt had the same problem, leading modders to create a patch called \\"The Pitt Crash Fix\\" which fixes the problems present in the wasteland but not interiors of The Pitt. Broken Steel Broken Steel is the third and most significant downloadable content pack, altering the original ending of Fallout 3 and allowing the player to continue playing past the end of the main quest line. If the player personally activates Project Purity, their character no longer dies but instead wakes up after a two-week coma to join the ranks of the Brotherhood of Steel and helps rid the Capital Wasteland of the Enclave once and for all. The pack raises the game's level cap from 20 to 30. It includes three main quests and three side-quests. Three Dog has new dialogue in this expansion, but no new songs are added. The new weapons in Broken Steel, including the Tesla Cannon, are some of the most powerful weapons in Fallout 3.Gamephoton 19 May 2009. Retrieved on 2009-19-05 Broken Steel was released on May 5, 2009 on Xbox Live and Games for Windows ‚Äì Live (GFWL). It was quickly removed from GFWL due to bugs which made the PC version of the expansion unplayable, and rereleased two days later. Some Xbox 360 users have reported a bug that prevents them from activating Project Purity, resulting in the plot elements added by the DLC being inaccessible. PC users report that changes caused by Broken Steel and the 1.5 patch adversely affect mods to the game. This pack was the first released for PlayStation 3 due to it being the most requested DLC for Fallout 3. This is primarily due to the continuation of the story past the game's original ending, and for the raise in the level cap from level 20 to 30, as many complained that the cap could be reached far too quickly in playing the game's main campaign. Bethesda announced on their website that \\"The first DLC for PlayStation 3, Broken Steel, [was] made available on September 24 in English territories and will be followed by the release of Operation: Anchorage and The Pitt on October 1, and Point Lookout and Mothership Zeta on October 8.\\" Plot Liberty Prime, an assault robot built before the Great War, attacks an enemy base. Broken Steel alters the ending of the original Fallout 3 to allow continued play after the end of the main quest line. When the player reaches the final point of the quest \\"Take it Back!\\", new options are given to allow specific followers to enter the reactor, but the original options still remain viable. Regardless of what is chosen, however, the player will wake up two weeks later at the Citadel (unless they allow the Purifier to explode, which automatically ends the game), having been knocked unconscious by an unknown radiation spike. Sarah Lyons will also be in a coma, unless she activated the purifier in which case she will have died. In the two weeks since the activation of the purifier, the Brotherhood has been using the now-reactivated Liberty Prime to root out the remaining Enclave presence in the Capital Wasteland. The player joins them, only to watch Liberty Prime be destroyed by a devastating orbital strike. Taking out this new threat becomes the top priority. A short side- mission is arranged to equip the player with the powerful Tesla Cannon, after which they move on the Enclave's massive Mobile Crawler base, located outside of the Wasteland at Adams Air Force Base. After fighting through the base personnel, a control station at the top can be used to call an orbital strike on the base itself, destroying it. Alternatively, the Citadel can be destroyed, branding the Lone Wanderer a traitor to the Brotherhood. Reception Broken Steel received positive reactions, averaging an 81 for the PC and an 82 for the Xbox 360. The Sacramento Bee wrote \\"The previous two downloadable expansions are good, but this one's pretty much essential for a Fallout 3 fan\\". IGN mirrored this view by stating \\"Lifting the level cap breathes new life into a great game, but shouldn't totally overshadow a new series of quests that is a lot of fun.\\" Edge on the other hand, while commenting that \\"it's the most you're going to get out of Fallouts current batch of DLC\\", it felt \\"it lacks the scope or density of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivions The Shivering Isles.\\" The A.V. Club commented that \\"After deflating the finality of the original ending, Broken Steel is unsure what to do next, beyond sending you on a few entertaining but hollow missions to snuff out the remnants of the para-military Enclave. Thankfully, the expansion's B-story is more thoughtful, as it plunges into the chaos and profiteering that result when a limited supply of clean water starts flowing into the Wasteland.\\" In their end of year awards special, IGN named Broken Steel Best Expansion for the PC.IGN Best of 2009, Best PC Expansion Point Lookout Point Lookout is the fourth downloadable content pack, and takes place in Point Lookout State Park in Maryland. No bombs were dropped on Point Lookout, but it has nonetheless degenerated into a place just as unforgiving as the Capital Wasteland. Humanity has left it behind and it is described as a large swamp wasteland. This pack has new enemies called swampfolk, who are inbred hillbillies that attack with weapons such as axes, shovels, and double- barreled shotguns. Unlike the previous content packs, which added additional landmarks to the main map (Broken Steel added two very limited maps), or had new maps with restricted exploration capabilities, Point Lookout has a fully explorable wasteland. Point Lookout was released on June 23, 2009 for the Xbox 360 and the PC and on October 8, 2009 for the PlayStation 3. Plot Point Lookout, unlike the other DLCs, does not have a specific goal. Rather, it adds a large area for the player to explore, with new enemies, such as swamp mirelurks, swamp ghouls, and the swampfolk, as well as items to find, such as the lever-action rifle, axe, and double barrel shotgun. One major quest line focuses on the rivalry between Desmond Lockheart and Professor Calvert, two scientists who have been feuding since before the Great War. Desmond has survived as a ghoul, while Calvert became a living brain. The feud can be ended by the Lone Wanderer in either Desmond's or Calvert's favor. Other quests include following the trail of a long-dead Chinese spy and discovering the mystery of the Lovecraftian tome known as the Krivbeknih. Reception Point Lookout received generally positive reviews, averaging a 79 for the PC and an 83 for the Xbox 360. Eurogamer stated \\"Like a compacted version of its parent game, this is the first DLC that has felt like a genuine expansion, as opposed to a just a few inconsequential missions thrown together.\\" IGN noted that \\"[t]he stories and characters here are filled with that trademark Fallout dark humor, elevating these quests to a level that rivals the main game\\" and that \\"[t]he major draw to Point Lookout... is its emphasis on exploration.\\" Edge calls it \\"the best expansion so far and the game at its worst,\\" stating \\"if you want a microcosm of Fallout 3, equal parts adventuring, grinding, questing and scavenging, you might just think it the best expansion so far.\\" Edge goes on to criticize Point Lookout for using \\"a lot of what you might call 'economy content' in Point Lookout: recycled enemies, text journals, variant weapons, and bogus forks in the storyline.\\" Mothership Zeta Mothership Zeta is the fifth and final downloadable content pack, and follows the main character after being abducted by aliens when going to explore a mysterious radio transmission from the Alien Crash Site. It takes place on an alien spacecraft, is a similar size to Operation: Anchorage, and has a similar emphasis on combat as that DLC had. It was released on August 3, 2009 for the Xbox 360 and PC and on October 8, 2009 for the PlayStation 3, along with Point Lookout. This expansion is a first for the series, as it explores an easter egg, specifically the crashed alien spacecraft that can be found in Fallout 3 and the original Fallout. Plot The Lone Wanderer receives an unintelligible radio transmission which leads them to the alien crash site. Upon approaching the wreckage, they are beamed into an alien mothership, Mothership Zeta, where they meet other prisoners who have been abducted over the centuries. The player is relieved of their equipment and locked in a cell with another abductee named Somah. With the help of Somah, a little girl named Sally, and a few unlikely allies from several different time periods, the Lone Wanderer must fight their way to the bridge of the ship and defeat the alien captain. Once the captain is defeated, the abductees take control of the mothership to battle another hostile alien vessel. The Lone Wanderer controls the death ray in the battle. Once the enemy ship is defeated, the Lone Wanderer becomes the captain of the ship and can return at will, though most of the ship is locked down after the battle. Reception Mothership Zeta received mixed reactions from critics, averaging a 70 for the PC and a 65 for the Xbox 360. Edge comments that \\"Mothership Zetas greatest asset is its looks\\" and that \\"whoever designed such beauty should be pretty peeved at the game around it.\\" Edge also noted that they \\"encountered a script bug so catastrophic that we couldn't finish the game ‚Äì we actually had to clip through a doorway and use console commands to bring everything back on track\\" and criticized the DLC for locking off most of the ship after completion. Eurogamer states that \\"the most disappointing factor about Mothership Zeta is how little subtlety is afforded to the details\\" and sums up the DLC as \\"repetitive, largely uninspired corridor combat, and boring, linear and samey mission design.\\" Gamedaily praises Mothership Zeta for \\"keep[ing] Fallouts trademark humor intact\\", its improved graphics, and for the new enemies and weapons introduced.

Tait McKenzie\`s Scots American War Memorial (1927), Edinburgh, Scotland. R. Tait McKenzie\`s Scots American War Memorial (1927), Edinburgh, Scotland has a line by Ewart Alan Mackintosh on the frieze at the back. The Scottish American Memorial, or Scots American War Memorial, is in West Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh. It was called \\"The Call 1914\\", and it was erected in 1927 and shows a kilted infantryman looking towards Castle Rock. Behind the main statue is a frieze showing queues of men answering the call by following a kilted pipe band. The memorial was given by Scottish-Americans to honour Scots who had served in the first World War. It is designated a Category B listed building by Historic Scotland. History The memorial was paid for by The Scottish ‚Äì American War Memorial Committee representing Scottish-Americans as a tribute to the bravery of Scottish troops during World War I. The Scottish National War Memorial (with similar design relating to the military in the Shrine) having been opened in July of that same year it was evidently relatedly unveiled on 7 September 1927 by the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Alanson B Houghton, with the Mackintosh's text reading \\"if it be life that waits, I shall live forever unconquered. If death, I shall die at last, strong in my pride and free\\" and with on the contemporary postcard the title \\"Spirit of 1914\\". \\"The Call 1914\\" (as actually named within the memorial) was designed by R. Tait McKenzie who was a Scottish Canadian working at the time at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. McKenzie only took to sculpture in later life having started his interests in physical education. His sculpture invariably was of life size male athletic figures. This work took him four years to complete. The bronze backdrop frieze shows Scots of differing professions answering the call and changing from civilians into marching soldiers. It was also by McKenzie, but the architect Reginald Fairlie was also involved. The stonework is constructed from Craigleith sandstone. At the very top of the design are the two intertwined escutcheons of America and Scotland. The memorial was said to have cost ten thousand pounds at the time it was built. At the bottom of the frieze are lines from E. A. Mackintosh's poem \\"A Creed\\": \\"If it be life that waits I shall live forever unconquered; if death I shall die at last strong in my pride and free.\\" Mackintosh was a 23-year-old ex-Oxford Classics student of Scottish descent who was killed at the second Battle of Cambrai in 1917. When R Tait McKenzie died he hoped to have his heart buried beneath this memorial, and this presumably either because he considered this his best work or also perhaps on account of a belief in its general significance in relation to First World War memorials in general and in particular perhaps the directly related Scottish National War Memorial.

Charles Edward Emery (29 March 1838 in Aurora, New York - 1898) was an American civil engineer. He was the son of Moses Little and Minerva (Prentiss) Emery, and a direct descendant of one of the original proprietors of the plantation of Contoocook, Massachusetts. He was educated at the academy in Canandaigua, New York, and early developed a taste for engineering. In July 1861, he entered the United States Navy as third assistant engineer, and served on the ‚ÄúRichmond‚Äù during engagements at Pensacola, Florida, the Mississippi river passes, and finally under David Farragut. In December 1862, he was promoted to second assistant engineer, and participated in the blockading of Charleston, South Carolina. In December 1867, he resigned, entered the employ of the Novelty Iron Works in New York City, and was general superintendent of the first American Institute Fair in its permanent quarters. In 1869, he engaged in business for himself, but soon afterward became consulting engineer of the United States Coast Survey and the United States Revenue Marine, and had charge of the construction of the vessels of the former service until its engineering department was put in the hands of the navy. In connection with chief-engineer Charles H. Loring, he instituted a series of experiments to determine the relative value of compound and non-compound engines, and his results were published in scientific journals at home and abroad. In 1879, he was appointed engineer of the New York Steam Company, and the entire plant of that company was constructed from his designs, and was under his direction. The details were entirely new, as similar previous work had been on a small scale. Emery divided New York City into ten heating districts, acquired land for central boiler plants, and began to lay the steam mains. Emery was considered one of the leading steam engineers of his day. For this unprecedented venture, his experience and ingenuity would be put to the test as he solved numerous technical challenges. Often he would consult with Thomas A. Edison when the two men happened to meet in the trenches, discussing the challenges of building their respective energy systems. New York Steam's first central steam boiler plant, located at Cortlandt, Dey, Greenwich, and Washington Streets, was completed in 1881 and included 48 boilers and a 225-foot chimney ‚Äî at the time, it was one of the tallest features of the lower New York skyline, second only to the spire of Trinity Church. The district steam installation was so novel it was the cover story of the November 19, 1881 issue of Scientific American. During the 1930s, the New York Steam Company maintained mutually beneficial business arrangements that would be a portent of its eventual consolidation. The company supplied steam to the Consolidated Gas Company and its affiliated gas and electric companies in Manhattan. In turn, The New York Edison Company supplied steam from its Waterside and Fourteenth Street electric generating stations during the morning hours on cold days to help meet peak energy needs. In 1932, Consolidated Gas acquired approximately 75 percent of New York Steam's common stock, and on March 8, 1954, the New York Steam Company fully merged with Consolidated Edison. Today, Con Edison operates the New York City steam system, the largest district steam system in the United States. The system contains 105 miles of mains and service pipes, providing steam for heating, hot water, and air conditioning to approximately 1,800 customers in Manhattan. Emery made several inventions in connection with steam engines, and conducted experiments for the purpose of testing the practicability of lining steam cylinders with non-conducting materials. He was one of the non-resident professors of Cornell university, and his lectures were published in the Scientific American supplements. In 1879, he received the honorary degree of Ph. D. from the University of New York. He wrote technical papers, principally relating to steam engineering, most of which were contributed to the Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, or those of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, of which organizations he was a member.

Mary was the wife of Thomas Stanley, 2nd Baron Monteagle, by whom she had six children. Mary Brandon was a lady-in-waiting to Queen consort Jane Seymour, third wife of King Henry VIII, who held her in high favour. She was the subject of a portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger. Family Lady Mary Brandon was born on 2 June 1510, the second eldest daughter of Charles Brandon by his second wife, Anne Browne, daughter of Sir Anthony Browne, Standard- Bearer of England and Lucy Neville daughter of John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu. Mary had an elder sister, Lady Anne Brandon. Prior to his marriage to Anne Browne, Charles Brandon had married her aunt, the wealthy widow, Margaret Neville; however, he had been previously bethrothed to Anne, and deserted her while she was pregnant with Mary's sister, Anne. After his marriage to Margaret was declared null and void due to his pre-contract with Anne Browne, he married the latter. Years later in 1528, Pope Clement VII issued a Papal Bull, which confirmed that Charles Brandon's divorce from Margaret Neville was valid, thus establishing the legitimacy of Mary and Anne. In 1511, Anne Browne died, and four years later, Charles Brandon, recently created Duke of Suffolk, married his third wife, Mary Tudor, the widowed Queen of France. Mary and Anne would be brought up with their father, stepmother and three half-siblings, Henry Brandon, 1st Earl of Lincoln, Lady Frances Brandon, and Lady Eleanor Brandon at Westhorpe Hall. In 1533, following the death of Mary Tudor on 25 June, Mary and her sister Anne, by then Baroness Grey of Powys, pushed themselves to the front of the funeral cortege at the Abbey of St. Edmundsbury, just as the coffin was being lowered into the crypt, much to the consternation of their half-siblings.Hester Chapman The Thistle and the Rose, p. 212 On 7 September 1533, Charles Brandon married his 14-year-old ward, Katherine Willoughby. ‚ÄûOn Sunday next the duke of Suffolk will be married to the daughter of a Spanish lady named lady Willoughby.

The term \\"Lower Assam\\" is often a misnomer in spite of popular usage to refer the region. In scholary circles Western Assam was more frequently used to accurately define the region and differentiate it from Lower Assam Division. Soon after the formal creation of the British districts in 1833, Lower Assam denoted one of the five initial districts that were created west of the Dhansiri river,\\"The territories on the west of the river Dhansiri were to be divided into five districts: (1) North- east Rangpur of Goalpara; (2) six paraganas of Kamrup, roughly corresponding to the present district of Barpeta including Bagarberra; (3) Lower Assam with twenty parganas, mostly on the north and the nine duars on the south; (4) Central Assam comprising Naduar, Charduar and Darrang on the north, Nagaon and Raha on the south of the Brahmaputra; (5) Biswanath, from the river Bharali to Biswanath on the north together with the territory known as Morung, extending from Kaliabor to the river Dhansiri.\\" which, along with the six paraganas, became a single district of Kamrup in 1836.\\"By 1836 the districts assumed names which became familiar in later years: Goalpara, Kamrup, Darrang and Nagaon.\\" It was home to the kingdom of Kamarupa (3‚Äì12 AD), ruled by Varman's and Pala's from their capital's Pragjyotishpura (Guwahati) and Durjaya (North Gauhati). Today Guwahati is the largest city of North-East India while Dispur, the capital of Assam, is within the town. Etymology In the 4th century, the region was mentioned as Kamarupa (Western Assam) in the Prayag stone inscription along with Davaka (central Assam).Suresh Kant Sharma, Usha Sharma (2005), Discovery of North-East India: Geography, History, Culture, Religion, Politics, Sociology, Science, Education and Economy - Volume 3, p. 248, Davaka (Nowgong) and Kamarupa as separate and submissive friendly kingdoms. Davaka was absorbed during the period between the 5th and 7th centuries.Kanak Lal Barua (1933), Early history of KƒÅmarupa, Page 47 \\"in the sixth or the seventh century this kingdom of Davaka was absorbed by Kamarupa.\\"\\"It is presumed that (Kalyanavarman) conquered Davaka, incorporating it within the kingdom of Kamarupa.\\" While Umachal inscription stands as an index to the spread of the Aryan culture up to the Gauhati area and the Barganga inscription speaks of the spread of the Aryan culture up to the Dabaka area, the present inscription stands as an unquestionable testimony to the spread of the Aryan culture up to the Sarupathar area of upper Assam as early as in the early part of the 5th century A.D. Medieval Muslim invaders continue to refer the region as Kamrup. Easternmost parts of the region (modern Kamrup) briefly became parts of Koch kingdom, Mughal empire and Ahom kingdom,\\"In the Battle of Itakhuli in September 1682, the Ahom forces chased the defeated Mughals nearly one hundred kilometers back to the Manas river. The Manas then became the Ahom-Mughal boundary until the British occupation.\\" until annexation of Eastern Assam by Burmese empire. With British occupation in the nineteenth century, the Goalpara region became part of Colonial Assam, while western Kamrup (North Bengal) was merged with Bengal. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the region became part of the Lower Assam Division, along with Darrang, Nagaon, Khasi and Jaintia Hills. The modern Western Assam and North Bengal, historically Kamrup,Upendranath Goswami (1970), A Study on KƒÅmr≈´pƒ´: A Dialect of Assamese, Page iii was referred to as Western Assam from colonial times and later. History 300 A.D Kingdoms - Davaka, Guptas, Kamarupa, Licchavis, Nagas, Pundravardhana, Samatata, Vakatakas Region was mentioned in Hindu epics as Pragjyotisha. Legends of king Naraka, Bhagadatta and Vajradatta has considerable part in Indian mythology. First historical mention of region was found in Arthashastra of Kautilya in 400 B.C., where he mentioned about flourishing trade between Maurya Empire and Kamarupa. Pragya stone pillar mentioned it as frontier kingdom along with Davaka of central Assam. Region served as capital of ancient Kamrup kingdom till its end, centered around modern Kamrup region. Kamarupa, the first historical kingdom of Assam, 7th‚Äì8th century cities Varman Dynasty Pushyavarman (350‚Äì374) named after Pushyamitra Shunga, became the first ruler of Kamrup as founder ruler of Varman Dynasty. His son Samudravarman (374‚Äì398), named after Samudragupta, was accepted as an overlord by many local rulers. Narayanavarman (494‚Äì518) and his son Bhutivarman (518‚Äì542) offered the Ashwamedha; and as the Nidhanpur inscription of Bhaskaravarman avers, these expansions included the region of Chandrapuri Visaya, identified with present-day Sylhet division. Thus, the small but powerful kingdom that Pushyavarman established grew in fits and starts over many generations of kings and expanded to include adjoining possibly smaller kingdoms and parts of Bangladesh covering most part of Eastern India, much larger area than modern Kamrup from which it initially begins. After the initial expansion till the beginning of Bhutivarman's reign, the kingdom came under attack from Yasodharman (525‚Äì535) of Malwa, the first major assault from the west. Though it is unclear what the effect of this invasion was on the kingdom; that Bhutivarman's grandson, Sthitavarman (566‚Äì590), enjoyed victories over the Gauda of Karnasuvarna and performed two aswamedha ceremonies suggests that the Kamarupa kingdom had recovered nearly in full. His son, Susthitavarman (590‚Äì600) came under the attack of Mahasenagupta of East Malwa. These back and forth invasions were a result of a system of alliances that pitted the Kamarupa kings (allied to the Maukharis) against the Gaur kings (allied with the East Malwa kings). Susthitavarman died as the Gaur invasion was on, and his two sons, Supratisthitavarman and Bhaskaravarman fought against an elephant force and were captured and taken to Gaur. They were able to regain their kingdom. Suprathisthitavarman's reign is given as 595‚Äì600, a very short period, at the end of which he died without an heir. inscription of BhaskaravarmanNidhanpur inscription of Bhaskaravarman Supratisthitavarman was succeeded by his brother, Bhaskaravarman (600‚Äì650), the most illustrious of the Varman kings who succeeded in turning his kingdom and invading the very kingdom that had taken him captive. Bhaskaravarman had become strong enough to offer his alliance with Harshavardhan just as the Thanesar king ascended the throne in 606 after the murder of his brother, the previous king, by Shashanka of Gaur. Harshavardhana finally took control over the kingless Maukhari kingdom and moved his capital to Kanauj. The alliance between Harshavardhana and Bhaskaravarman squeezed Shashanka from either side and reduced his kingdom, making Shasanka escaping to hills further south near modern Bengali-Orissan border. This decisive victory leads to takeover of most of Gauda kingdom by Bhaskaravarman. He issued the Nidhanpur copper-plate inscription from his victory camp in the Gaur capital Karnasuvarna (present- day Murshidabad, West Bengal) to replace a grant issued earlier by Bhutivarman for a settlement in the Sylhet region of present-day Bangladesh. Nalanda seal of Bhaskaravarman In about 643, Xuanzang (Xuanzang/Hiuen Tsang) visited Bhaskaravarman's court and recorded details of his kingdom. Xuanzang mentioned the western border of the Kamarupa kingdom was the Karatoya river and eastern boundary as Dikkaravasini (Sadiya). At the end of this visit, Bhaskaravarman accompanied Xuanzang to Kanauj, and participated in a religious assembly and a festival at Prayaga (Allahabad) with Harshavardhana, spending more than a year away from his own kingdom. Assembly was participated by eighteen vassal kings, while Bhaskaravarman impersonated as \\"Brahma\\", Harsha kept himself the subordinate position of \\"Indra\\". It seems Bhaskaravarman maintained relations with China. He recounted to Xuanzang a Chinese song about the Jin dynasty which became very popular in his kingdom. In 648 A.D after the death of Harshavardhana, Wang-Hiuen-ts'oe was sent on a mission to India with Tsiang Cheu-jenn as his second in command was helped by Bhaskaravarman, according to a Chinese account. Bhaskaravarman, also called Kumar, or Shri Kumar, was a bachelor king and died without an heir. Pala Dynasty Palas, Madan Kamdev Brahma Pala (900‚Äì920), was founder Pala Dynasty (900‚Äì1100 A.D) of Kamarupa. Dynasty ruled from its capital Durjaya, modern-day North Guwahati. The greatest of the Pala kings, Dharma Pala had his capital at Kamarupa Nagara, now identified with North Guwahati. Ratna Pala was another notable sovereign of this line. Records of his land-grants have been found at Bargaon and Sualkuchi, while a similar relic of Indra Pala, has been discovered at Guwahati. Pala dynasty come to end with Jaya Pala (1075‚Äì1100). People Demography According to 2011 census, Western Assam has total population of 11,253,550; out of which urban population accounting to 1,959,707 while rural population is 9,293,843. Ethnic division The ethnic composition of the region is diverse. Hindu caste composed of Kamrupi and Goalpariya people are majority. It has considerable number of tribal population consisting Bodo, Rabha and Koch in the north, south and southwest. Culture Villages still contained the traditional Vedic culture, while in case of towns and cities it relaxed a bit. Western Assamese culture largely flourished in the reign of Pushyavarman (350-374), the founder of great Varman dynasty of Kamrup Kingdom which reached its zenith in the reign of Bhaskaravarman (600‚Äì650). Scholars believe Kamrupi culture had a distinctive mark in every sphere, whether it be science or literature. Astronomy is a Kamrupi science. Daka, the great Kamrupi poet flourished undoubtedly during the ancient period.Barua, Prafulla Chandra (1967), Fragments of a lost picture, Page viii Festivals Durga Puja, Kali Puja and other Pujas; Diwali, Holi, Janmastami, Shivratri to name a few, are major festivals of the region. Muslims celebrate Eid. There is hardly any dance and music of the Bihu type so common in Eastern Assam, but a special spring time festival of this region is a fair usually held in the first week of Baihag or third week of April. It is known as \\"Bhatheli\\" in northern Kamrup, \\"Sori\\" or \\"Suanri\\" in southern Kamrup.Goswami Upendranath (1970), A Study on KƒÅmr≈´pƒ´: A Dialect of Assamese, p. 13 In certain areas the breakers of the \\"bhatheli-ghar\\" come from another village, resulting in a sort of mock fight between them and the local youth. In the southern part of Kamrup, where the festival is known as Sori, planting of tall bamboos is not seen, but bamboo posts,with the tuft at the top. People bow before the bamboos in northern Kamrup and they also touch them with reverence, but it does not look like any sort of bamboo worship.Goswami Praphulladatta (1966), The Springtime Bihu of Assam: A Socio-cultural Study, P 25 The common popular term to designate the three festivals corresponding to Bihu of Eastern Assam, in Western Assam, except in West Goalpara, is \\"Domahi\\", e.g., \\"Baihagar Domahi\\", \\"Maghar Domahi\\" and \\"Katir Domahi\\".Bƒ´rendranƒÅtha Datta, Nabƒ´nacandra ≈öarmƒÅ, Prabin Chandra Das (1994), A Handbook of Folklore Material of North-East India, p. 158≈öarmƒÅ Nabƒ´nacandra (1988), Essays on the Folklore of North- eastern India, P 64 Religion Hinduism and Islam are major religions of the region. Hinduism is further divided into Vaishnavism and Shaktism. Hindu way of life can be observed in dressing, food and lifestyle, an important aspect of cultural identity for people of the region. Hindu kingdoms as political identities made a long-lasting impact on region defining the way of the life. In the early part of second millennium, Islam arrived in the region with Turkish and Afghan invaders. Languages In the first half of the seventh century, Chinese pilgrimage Xuanzang visited the region and wrote about language, which convinced Upendranath Goswami and others that \\"Assamese entered into Kamarupa or western Assam where this speech was first characterised as Assamese. This is evident from the remarks of Hiuen Tsang who visited the Kingdom of Kamarupa in the first half of the seventh century A.D., during the reign of Bhaskaravarman.\\" Indo-Aryan languages are predominant in the region, Kamrupi and Goalpariya languages are spoken in Kamrup and Goalpara regions and acts as lingua franca among various tribal groups. Bodo, Rabha, Koch are other minority languages used in tribal belts. Music The folk songs of Goalpara region is known as Goalpariya Lokgeet, of Kamrup region is known as Kamrupi Lokgeet. Kamrupi dance is a form of dance technique that evolved from Bhaona which is a sophisticated type of dancing.Banerji, Projesh (1959),The folk-dance of India, Page 72 Cuisine The food of Western Assam is homogenous to a certain extent with nearby eastern states of West Bengal and Bihar. Mustard seeds is generously used in cooking, while ginger, garlic, pepper, and onions are extensively used. Traditional utensils are made of bell metal though stainless steel is quite common in modern times. Food of Eastern Assam has much tribal influence instead of pan-Indian, like usage of bamboo shoot both fresh and fermented.Das Jyoti (2008), Ambrosia, from the Assamese Kitchen See also * People from Western Assam * Kamrup * Kamrupi References Bibliography Further reading   External links * Kamarupa at Online Britannica ","title":"Lower Assam"},{"id":"25111334","text":"Bromelia palmeri is a plant species in the genus Bromelia.

It is owned and operated by the Fort Wayne Allen County Airport Authority. In the FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2009‚Äì2013 it is a general aviation airport.National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2009‚Äì2013: Appendix A: Part 2 (PDF, 1.04 MB). Federal Aviation Administration. Updated 15 October 2008. The airport was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. History Smith Field is Fort Wayne's first municipal airport and is one of America's oldest surviving aviation sites. The United States government's pioneering of a national airmail system begun in 1918, provided essential subsidies for America's fledgling airline industry. On June 25, 1925 the city of Fort Wayne commissioned this airfield as the Paul Baer Municipal Airport. New paved runways, the huge heated Hangar #2 and other ongoing improvements to Baer Field finally attracted a commercial airmail carrier to Fort Wayne in December 1930. Transamerican, Capitol Airways, and Trans Continental and Western (TWA) followed with passenger service to Fort Wayne during the early 1930s. In 1932 nearly 3,000 passengers were served at old Paul Baer Municipal Airport. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs Federal New Deal employment programs of the Great Depression further upgraded the airfield. In 1933, the Commerce Department's Aeronautics Branch and the Civil Works Administration (CWA) began a nationwide program of airport development. The CWA funded 13,108 man-hours of labor on Baer Field in 1933 alone, including drainage, lighting, sodding, tree removal, improved heating systems, improved parking areas, and the creation of flowerbeds. By 1934, the airport had improved the concrete runways and aprons, and in 1935 and 1936, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) funded more concrete pavement, lighting upgrades, and radio communication equipment. Old Baer Field was one of the largest WPA projects in Indiana. During this period, the airport enjoyed $311,058.42 in improvements paid for by the CWA, the Federal Emergency Relief Agency, the WPA, and the Allen County Scrip Organization. Famous pilots who have visited Smith Field include: \\"Wrong Way\\" Douglas Corrigan, race pilot and military hero General Jimmy Doolittle, stunt flyer Jimmie Hayslip, Walter Hinton, Howard Hughes, airmail pilot George Hill, Charles Lindbergh, Captain Charles Nungesser, and fighter \\"Ace of Aces\\" Captain Eddie Rickenbacker. Captain Sir George Wilkins flew into the airport in the aircraft he had piloted to the North Pole. Famed pilot and explorer Wiley Post also visited the field in the Lockheed Vega \\"Winnie Mae\\", which he flew around the world. As every prominent aviator arrived, so did the community. Ordinary Fort Wayne residents of that era literally rubbed elbows with the pioneer aviation \\"greats\\". The federal government's anticipation of World War II and old Baer Field's role in the pioneer airmail service brought the U.S. War Department to Fort Wayne in 1940. Baer Field had been included in a list of some 1000 airfields that the Army Air Corps evaluated for new military flight operations. The new Development of Landing Areas for National Defense (DLAND) program eventually funded construction at 535 airports during World War II. Fearing the loss of civilian access to Baer Field, city leaders took options to buy south of the city should the War Department decide to operate a military airfield in Fort Wayne. Early in January 1941, the War Department informed the city that it would locate a base in Fort Wayne if it could take possession by February 1. Some thirty local businessmen signed notes totaling the $125,000 needed to arrange for the acquisition by the city. The War Department signed a $1/year lease for the south side property and invited the community to suggest a name. The citizens of Fort Wayne supplied: \\"General Anthony Wayne Field\\", in honor of the Revolutionary War hero who was the builder of the first United States fort in Fort Wayne, and \\"Smith Field\\", celebrating Fort Wayne native Arthur \\"Art\\" Smith. Since Army Air Corps policy was to name airfields for deceased military aviators, a solution was found in naming the new Army airfield (south of town) after Paul Baer and renaming the existing municipal airport after Art Smith. The Army airfield (presently Fort Wayne International Airport) was officially designated the new \\"Baer Field\\" on June 14, 1941, and became a live Army base on December 6, 1941‚Äîthe day before the attack on Pearl Harbor‚Äîwith the arrival of 31 P-39 Airacobra fighter planes. Within days, as many as 100 of the planes were stationed there. The old Baer Field, now renamed Smith Field, would remain Fort Wayne's civil airport through World War II, and has since served general aviation.http://wikimapia.org/9385/Smith-Field Modern activity In 2010 Runway 5/23 was rebuilt.https://www.flickr.com/photos/flysmd/sets/72157625426148368/ The airport offers aviation instruction and plane rental through Sweet Aviation, a subsidiary of Sweetwater Sound.

In 2007 the airport had 20,109 aircraft operations, average 55 per day: 100% general aviation and <1% air taxi. 56 aircraft were then based at this airport: 96% single-engine and 4% multi-engine.

However, since Frans received a registered pupil in 1553 it is more likely that Frans had become a master in the Guild earlier.De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde] van 1453-1615, edited and published by Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, Antwerp, 1872-1876, p. 184 It is suspected that Gillis worked along Marten van Cleve and Maerten de Vos in the studio of Frans Floris, the leading Antwerp history painter of his time. Military expedition in winter Gillis Mostaert married Margareta Baes in 1563 and the couple had six children. He was well-respected by his fellow painters. The painters Peeter Baltens and Crispin van den Broeck were godfathers to his children born in 1571 and 1588. Mostaert established a thriving workshop in Antwerp and his work commanded high prices in the market. Inventories of art collections from most important collectors of the late 16th and early 17th centuries list many expensive cabinet paintings of Mostaert, which shows that his work received patronage of prominent and well-off private clients.Buyck Jean F., Gillis Mostaert - Christus door Pilatus aan het volk getoond at tento These collectors included Fran√ßois Perrenot de Granvelle (1559-1607) (younger brother of Cardinal Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle), Archduke Ernest of Austria (1553-1595) and Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria. Filips van Valckenisse who was the Lord of Hemiksem, head of the Antwerp militia and perhaps Antwerp's greatest art collector owned over 50 paintings by Mostaert.Gillis Mostaert, Lot and his daughters guided by angels, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah beyond at Sotheby's Landscape with the flight into Egypt He died in Antwerp. It is believed that he was heavily indebted at the time of his death and that the contents of his workshop was sold off or distributed to creditors to pay off these debts. Many of his works were acquired by Filips van Valckenisse, lord of Hemiksem, who still owned a number of these when he died himself in 1614. Work Very few works can be attributed with certainty to Gillis Mostaert as he signed few of his paintings. He added usually the monogram GM and the year on those works that he signed. Mostaert likely operated a large workshop with an important output. He seems to have worked mainly for private clients to whom he supplied pictures in a wide range of subjects. These included scenes of markets, fairs and village, allegories of the four seasons, winter and snow landscapes, scenes of war, hell and burning houses, religious subjects as well as parables and allegories.Gillis Mostaert (1528-98): a contemporary of Bruegel at codart Mostaert often used copper as a support for his oil paintings, which gives them a certain luster or glowing appearance. The haywain Mostaert is believed to have played an important role in the development in Antwerp of genre and landscape art, through his scenes depicting the activities of contemporary people by means of the many small figures in his compositions. He is further credited with the introduction into genre art of the Mannerist style of representing the human figure that was typical for the Antwerp Mannerists of the Frans Floris School. Key characteristics of this emerging style are the natural depiction of nature and reflecting surfaces, the inclusion of various small figures to animate his canvases and the blending of landscape with history.Christine G√∂ttler, ‚ÄúWit in Painting, Color in Words: Gillis Mostaert‚Äôs Depictions of Fires‚Äù, in: Trading Values in Early Modern Antwerp, Netherlands Yearbook for History of Art 64 (2014), ed. Christine G√∂ttler, Bart Ramakers, Joanna Woodall (Leiden: Brill, 2014), pp. 214-237 Village fair, 1590 He was in his time known for the wit displayed in his works. He reportedly painted a Resurrection of Lazarus, which included a self-portrait of himself amongst the crowd holding his nose so as not to smell Lazarus‚Äô smell of decay. He was thus regarded as continuing a Flemish artistic tradition of which Hieronymus Bosch was the earliest representative and of which his contemporary Pieter Bruegel the Elder was another example. He was active as an imitator of Hieronymus Bosch. For his Bosch-inspired compositions he drew his main inspiration from one of the five tapestries after Bosch that were woven for Cardinal Granvelle in Brussels in 1566. A composition inspired by Bosch is the Haywain (also known as the Allegory on worldly and clerical abuses) of which he produced various versions (e.g. Rijksmuseum on loan to the Museum Catharijneconvent). The picture is an allegorical painting, which satirizes the Roman Catholic Church. The battle for the hay represents the greed that leads to strife, misery, death and destruction. The 16th-century meaning of the expression \\"It's all hay\\" was: it's all worthless, a deception. In the picture Mostaert has placed monks and church dignitaries closest to the haywain in criticism of the Catholic clergy. Throughout the composition the seven deadly sins are represented: gluttony, sloth, envy, avarice, pride, wrath and lust. For instance, a man on the far left has fallen asleep on a bag of hay and represents sloth.Gillis (I) Mostaert, Hooiwagen at the Museum Catharijneconvent Landscape with marauding soldiers Mostaert's 'fire paintings' were listed in the inventories of important collectors of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Scenes depicting the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the burning of villages at night gave the artist the opportunity to show off his skill in rendering the effects of light and fire.Gillis Mostaert, Lot and his daughters guided by angels, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah beyond at Sotheby's One of his masterpieces in this genre is the Landscape with marauding soldiers (1569, Louvre). This composition offers a nightly view over a landscape with a river an at least 8 sources of fire extending over the whole horizon. The fires were likely set by soldiers, some of whom are shown under attack by villagers in retribution. The villagers appear to have gained the upper hand on the soldiers some of whom together with their female companions are shown on the foreground lying on the ground under threat of being killed. The loot including some gleaming pots and pans and some bundles is likely to be recovered by the villagers.David Kunzle, From Criminal to Courtier: The Soldier in Netherlandish Art 1550-1672, BRILL, 1 Jan 2002, pp. 175-176 The baptism of Christ Mostaert is credited with the invention of paintings of biblical scenes, which are framed on all sides by smaller scenes in grisaille painted on wood. An example is The Baptism of Christ (Fondation Custodia). Mostaert started creating these composite paintings from the 1570s onwards. Several of his paintings in this style were formerly incorrectly ascribed to Frans Francken the Younger who painted similar scenes into the 1620s.Martha Hollander, An Entrance for the Eyes: Space and Meaning in Seventeenth-century Dutch Art, University of California Press, 2002, p. 35. He was sought after as a staffage painter and added the figures in landscapes of his Antwerp colleagues such as Cornelis van Dalem (to whom he introduced Bartholom√§us Spranger as a pupil), Marten van Cleve, Cornelis Molenaer and Jacob Grimmer and in the architectural paintings and city views of Hendrik van Steenwijck I and Hans Vredeman de Vries .

He specialized in paintings of animal and nature scenes. Teodoro was known mostly for his drawings and illustration of animals. His brother Giorgio Ghisi, was a well-known engraver. Teodoro was a custodian of the Duchal summer house known as the Palazzo del Te in Mantua. The Duke's extensive natural history collection attracted a visit in 1571 from Ulisse Aldrovandi, for whom he executed some animal paintings, including those of two parrots. At around the same time he created the designs for Giorgio's engravings of Venus and Adonis and Angelica and Medoro. In 1576 he and Giorgio acquired a house in Mantua, where Teodoro worked for Dukes Guglielmo Gonzaga and Vincenzo I. Between 1579 and 1581 he contributed to the decoration of the Galleria dei Mesi in the Palazzo Ducale and probably worked with Lorenzo Costa the younger in the Sala dello Zodiaco there. Around 1579 he executed a Visitation for the cathedral at Carpi, and in 1586-7 he worked in the Palazzo di Goito (destr.). From 1587 to 1590 he was court painter to Guglielmo Gonzaga's brother-in-law Archduke Charles II of Austria (1564‚Äì90), in Seckau and Graz, where he painted the altarpiece Symbolum apostolorum (1588; Graz, Alte Gallery), showing the creation of Eve surrounded by depictions of articles of the Nicene Creed. He received a life pension from the Archduke in 1589 but returned to Mantua in 1590. There, he and Ippolito Andreasi decorated the cathedral for Bishop Francesco Gonzaga, with frescos that accorded with the dictates of the Counter-Reformation. The evangelists' animal symbols attest to Teodoro's continuing interest in nature. He indulged this further in his illustrations for Pietro Candido Decembrio's De animantium naturis.Rome, Vatican, Bib. Apostolica, MS.

Born to Danish parents, he began his studies in France and emigrated to the United States in 1986. His constructivist analysis of the co-production of psychical \\"facts\\" emphasises the accuracy of historical accounts of mental disorders. Borch-Jacobsen is known for his positions in the controversies surrounding psychoanalysis, especially with regard to the 2005 publication of Le Livre noir de la psychanalyse (\\"The Black Book of Psychoanalysis\\") to which he was a major contributor. In a review of Borch-Jacobsen's book Folies √† plusieurs. De l'hyst√©rie √† la d√©pression (\\"Many madnesses. From hysteria to depression\\"), Pierre-Henri Castel calls him \\"one of the most polemic thinkers with regard to the Freud Wars\\". Biography Borch-Jacobsen studied philosophy with Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy, two philosophers close in thought to, and in dialogue with, Jacques Derrida and Jacques Lacan. In 1981 at the University of Strasbourg he submitted his doctoral dissertation on The Freudian Subject and then began teaching in the department of Psychoanalysis at Vincennes University in Paris, where Jacques Lacan had first made his mark. In 1986 he emigrated to the United States. Criticism of psychoanalysis Hypnosis In 1983, Borch-Jacobsen participated in a meeting on the subject of hypnosis at the H√¥pital Fernand-Widal where he joined such other as L√©on Chertok, Ren√© Girard and Fran√ßois Roustang in the discussion of hypnosis. The following year, he published with √âric Michaud and Jean-Luc Nancy, Hypnoses. In this book, the authors consider the whole history of therapeutic hypnosis, the psychological or sociological theory becoming suspect to dangerous regressions from intellectual, ethical and political ideas. On 21 January 1985, he presented a conference paper entitled \\"L'hypnose dans la psychanalyse\\" (\\"Hypnosis in psychoanalysis\\") to the Society of Psychosomatic Medicine. The text of this paper was then published in collaboration with Chertok in 1987, with replies from many psychoanalysists, philosophers and sociologists, such as Georges Lapassade, Octave Mannoni and Franklin Rausky. In this paper, Borch-Jacobsen presented evidence that psychoanalytic transference is a form of altered state of consciousness, comparable with those that had existed in the work of psychotherapies which predate psychoanalysis, from Shamanism to the hypnotism of the Nancy School, by way of animal magnetism. He averred that \\"\\" (\\"On Freud's own admission, the phenomenon of transference is nothing other than the resurgence, in the bosom of [psycho]analytical] techniques, of the characteristic relationship (of 'rapport') of hypnosis techniques: dependence, submission, or again... exclusive worship of the doctor\\"). He emphasised that there is consequently an important risk of suggestion on the part of the psychoanalyst, even more so when the psychoanalyst himself is not conscious of these phenomena. Borch- Jacobsen then reaffirmed that Sigmund Freud, after having started to use the suggestive hypnotic psychotherapy of Hippolyte Bernheim in 1887, replaced it with the cathartic method in 1899, no longer using hypnosis as a means of direct suggestion, but to bring out suppressed feelings of patients' traumas. After practicing using free association in 1892, Freud totally abandoned hypnosis at the end of 1896. This is explained in the following manner by Chertok: \\"\\" (\\"In his opposition to hypnosis, Freud was known to have founded a scientific psychotherapy, destined, as such, to become the psychotherapy par excellence. The interpretation and awareness thus became the fulcrum of the cure. The affectivity in the new method certainly could not be discounted, but in it one can find it being channelled into transference, and by that, come to be controlled and put it at the service of knowledge. Such was the ambition of the founder of psychoanalysis [Freud], and the turn of the century was once again filled with the spirit of Positivism\\"). It is precisely this posture of Freud's that the consciousness is \\"dominating\\" that was put into question by Borch-Jacobsen. Bertrand M√©heust rebuked Borch-Jacobsen for accepting without further discussion a dated view of hypnotherapy, bequeathed by the positivist institutional medicine of the 19th century.M√©heust, p. 31 Furthermore, he argues that hypnosis follows a state of absolute passivity and therefore hurts well-being, and that hypnosis is induced in someone in which all consciousness is disconnected, a being totally immersed in the inner self, indeed a puppet who thinks and lives totally by the workings of another.M√©heust, p. 292 He takes sides with Puys√©gur and Deleuze, stating that lucid, magnetic phenomena are assumed to establish a kind of synergy between the higher functions of intelligence and the immediacy of instinct.  The case of Anna O.  In 1996 he completed a treatise on the case of Bertha Pappenheim, \\"Anna O.\\", subtitled (\\"A 100-year-old mystery\\"), in which, according to Claude Meyer, he \\"\\" (\\"put an end to one of the founding myths of psychoanalysis\\"). It is also the opinion of Elizabeth Loentz, who had also written a book on Pappenheim, and Paul Roazen, who considers this work a major stage of university and historiographical work on psychoanalysis, and a fly in the ointment of the \\"defenders of the status quo\\".  Le Livre noir de la psychanalyse  In 2005 he collaborated in writing (\\"The Black Book of Psychoanalysis\\"), a book which received a great reception and has been the subject of several commentaries.

Rucaparib is a first-in-class pharmaceutical drug targeting the DNA repair enzyme poly-ADP ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1). It is approved in the United States and in Europe as third line treatment in BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer. It can be taken orally in tablet form. The most common side effects include tiredness or weakness, nausea (feeling sick), increased levels of creatinine (which may indicate kidney problems) and liver enzymes in the blood (which may indicate liver damage), vomiting, anaemia (low red blood cell counts), decreased appetite, dysgeusia (taste disturbances), diarrhoea, thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets) and abdominal pain (belly ache).  Medical uses  Rucaparib is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adults with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy. Rucaparib is indicated as monotherapy treatment of adults with platinum sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic), high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have been treated with two or more prior lines of platinum based chemotherapy, and who are unable to tolerate further platinum based chemotherapy.  Development  It was discovered as part of a collaboration between scientists working at the Northern Institute of Cancer Research and Medical School of Newcastle University and Agouron Pharmaceuticals in San Diego, California. It is being developed by Clovis Oncology. In December 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an accelerated approval for use in cases of pretreated advanced ovarian cancer. In the European Union it was designated an orphan medicinal product on 10 October 2012. On 22 March 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a conditional marketing authorisation, intended for the treatment of relapsed or progressive ovarian cancer. It was approved for medical use in the European Union in May 2018. Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency.

Pharmacology Mechanism of action Rucaparib inhibits \\"the contraction of isolated vascular smooth muscle, including that from the tumours of cancer patients. It also reduces the migration of some cancer and normal cells in culture.\\" As a PARP inhibitor, rucaparib is expected to be more effective in the 9% of pancreatic cancers with a BRCA mutation (BRCA1 or BRCA2).  Clinical trials  After the FDA approval, TRITON2 and TRITON3 mCRPC studies were initiated in order to determine how patients with prostate cancer will respond to the rucaparib drug. The studies for these two trials are still going on and the estimated dates for the first results are range between 2019 and 2022.\\" The ARIEL3 and ARIEL4 are two randomized, double-blind phase III studies. The ARIEL3 study was designed to evaluate the effect of the investigational agent as a maintenance treatment for the advanced platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients compared placebo after their response to at least two prior chemotherapies. The top-line results from the study were presented at the ESMO 2017 congress and right after that, it was published in the Lancet journal in September 2017. The findings showed significant improvement in progression- free survival (PFS) in patients treated with Rubraca than placebo. Recently, in October 2017, a supplemental sNDA for the rucaparib ARIEL3 maintenance treatment has been submitted to the FDA. The ARIEL4 trial is still ongoing to evaluate how patients will best respond to treatment with rucaparib compared with chemotherapy. The estimated data collection date for primary outcome measurement will be in June 2022.\\"  See also  * PARP inhibitor  References   External links  Benzazepines Cancer treatments Indoles Lactams PARP inhibitors Fluoroarenes Orphan drugs ","title":"Rucaparib"},{"id":"25111669","text":"Zeljko Marasoviƒá (sometimes spelled Zeljko Marasovich; born in Zagreb, Croatia) is a Croatian American composer of classical and film music.http://www.tribehollywood.com/tribehollywood/Motor_DisplayProfile?id=1916006387 Biography Marasovich studied piano, organ and composition at the Zagreb Academy of Music and Santa Cecilia Conservatory in Rome.

Racing career 1999-2001 France She made her racing debut for owner/breeder Catherine Dubois in June 1999 and on July 16, 1999 got her first win in the Prix des Edelweiss at Aix-les-Bains racecourse. After winning the September 24 Prix de Mereville she was claimed by Jozef de Cock. From her twelve minor race starts that year, she won five and was second four times. Winless at age three in six starts, Starine made her final start of 2000 on November 30 in the Listed Prix Ceres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse in which she finished last in a sixteen-horse field after having to be pulled up. 2001-2002 France Brought to the United States by U.S. Hall of Fame trainer, Robert Frankel, Starine made her American debut on May 18, 2001 with a second-place finish in the Grade 3 Gallorette Handicap at Pimlico Race Course. Then, on June 6, 2001, she ran fifth in another Grade III, the Just A Game Breeders' Cup Handicap at Belmont Park. In her third American start, Starine won an Allowance race at Saratoga Race Course then on the same course captured the October 3 Grade 2 Diana Handicap. She next ran third in the Grade 1 Flower Bowl Invitational Handicap and tenth to the Frankel-trained Banks Hill in the 2001 Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf, both races at Belmont Park.

A bottle of white Bourgogne Hautes-C√¥tes de Beaune. Hautes-C√¥tes de Beaune is a subregion of the Burgundy wine region located to the west of the C√¥te de Beaune subregion. While C√¥te de Beaune consists of vineyards located on or close to the main C√¥te d'Or escarpment, Hautes-C√¥tes de Beaune covers the area on top of the escarpment, and the adjacent area of various valleys and slopes. Only one appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC), Bourgogne Hautes-C√¥tes de Beaune, covers the entire subregion; there are no specific AOCs named after villages in this subregion, and also no Premier Cru vineyards.BIVB: Bourgogne Hautes- C√¥tes de Beaune This AOC may be used for red and ros√© wines with Pinot noir as the main grape variety, as well as white wines with Chardonnay as the main grape variety, and was created in 1961. The AOC extends into two departments: * In the C√¥te-d'Or department: 12 communes situated above the escarpment (the actual Hautes C√¥tes), and the top parts of 10 communes that are mainly situated in C√¥te de Beaune. * In the Sa√¥ne-et-Loire department: four communes situated above the escarpment, and the top parts of three communes that are mainly situated in C√¥te de Beaune. The border between Hautes-C√¥tes de Beaune and Hautes-C√¥tes de Nuits to the north passes through Magny-l√®s-Villers.  Production  In 2008, there was of vineyard surface in production in the Hautes-C√¥tes de Beaune, and 39,496 hectoliter of wine was produced, of which 32,500 hectoliter red wine (including a small amount of ros√©) and 6,996 hectoliter white wine.BIVB: Les Appellations d‚ÄôOrigine Contr√¥l√©e de Bourgogne, accessed on November 17, 2009 The total amount produced corresponds to close to 5.3 million bottles, of which slightly over 4.3 million bottles of red wine and just over 900,000 bottles of white wine.  AOC regulations  For white wines, the AOC regulations allow both Chardonnay and Pinot blanc to be used, but most wines are 100% Chardonnay. The AOC regulations also allow up to 15 per cent total of Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris as accessory grapes in the red wines,AOC regulations, last updated 2006 but this not very often practiced. The allowed base yield is 50 hectoliter per hectare of red wine and 55 hectoliter per hectare for white wine. The grapes must reach a maturity of at least 10 per cent potential alcohol for red wine, 10.5 per cent for white wine and wine.
