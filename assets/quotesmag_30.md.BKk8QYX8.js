She contributed to the field of cancer research by studying the cure for melanoma. Cobb was an advocate for increasing the representation of women and students of color in universities, and she created programs to support students interested in pursuing graduate school.  Early life  Jewel Isadora Plummer was the only child of Frank V. Plummer, and Carriebel (Cole) Plummer. Her mother, Carriebel, found employment as a physical education and dance teacher who graduated from college with a B.A in interpretive dancing. She had re- entered college the same time Jewell enrolled resulting in both mother and daughter getting degrees in the same year. Jewell's father, Frank, was the first black person to graduate with a Doctor of Medicine from Cornell University, becoming a physician specializing in dermatology. Plummer's paternal grandfather was a freed slave who graduated from Howard University in 1898 making a living as a pharmacist. Cobb's economically privileged upbringing offered her a childhood of intellectual exploration. From her father's scientific library to her education at several multiracial institutions, Cobb developed an interest in learning from a young age. Although she anticipated becoming a physical education teacher, her interest in science solidified during her sophomore year of high school whilst looking through a microscope in biology class. This interest was encouraged by her biology teacher and she was fascinated by books on microorganisms like Paul DeKruif's The Microbe Hunters.  Higher education  Cobb matriculated at the University of Michigan in 1942, but, dissatisfied with segregated housing for African-American students at Michigan, she transferred to Talladega College in Alabama. Talladega College did not accept transfer credits forcing Cobb to start anew. In spite of this, she completed her course work in three years instead of the standard four. She graduated with a B.A. in biology in 1944 and became a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. Cobb initially was denied a fellowship for graduate study in biology at New York University, allegedly due to her race, but was granted the fellowship after an interview. She earned her M.S. degree from New York University in 1947, and her Ph.D. degree with a focus on cell physiology in 1950 Her dissertation, Mechanisms of Pigment Formation, examined melanin pigment granules formations in vitro using the enzyme tyrosinase.Warren, W. (1999). Black women scientists in the United States. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. In 1949, she was appointed an independent investigator at Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory.  Professional life  After receiving her Ph.D, Cobb became a biology teaching fellow at New York University while also working for the National Cancer Institute at Harlem Hospital (1950-1952).  University of Illinois College of Medicine  From 1952-1954 Cobb was an instructor in anatomy in Chicago at the University of Illinois College of Medicine where she taught histology.  Hunter College  Shortly thereafter, Cobb returned to New York, serving as an assistant professor for NYU's post graduate medical school (1955‚Äì60), while also working as a visiting lecturer at Hunter College (1956‚Äì57).\\"CC NEWS Press Release\\", February 12, 1969. Plummer Cobb Jewel, Folder 1. Linda Lear Center for Special Collections and Archives, Connecticut College, New London, CT.  Sarah Lawrence College  From 1960-69, Cobb was employed as head of the biology laboratory at Sarah Lawrence College. While there, she conducted research for participants in the National Science Foundation.  Connecticut College  Cobb served as a professor of Zoology and as Dean of Arts and Sciences at Connecticut College from July 1969 until July 1976. Cobb was the first black Dean in the College's history.\\"CC NEWS Press Release 1976.\\" Plummer Cobb Jewel, Folder 1. Linda Lear Center for Special Collections and Archives, Connecticut College, New London, CT. Upon accepting the position at Connecticut College, she expressed: \\"This is a college in transition, moving forward at an exciting pace. We need more black students and teachers to help us formulate and carry out our bold new plans.\\" During her time at Connecticut College, she implemented a Black Scholarship program that provided financial assistance to at least 37 Black undergraduates at the college. The scholarship intended to increase financial assistance needs for students of color. This work inspired similar programs at other universities. Cobb also established a Fifth Year Post-Baccalaureate Pre-Medical Program, which provided financial assistance and educational opportunities for minority students at the College who wanted to pursue careers in medicine or dentistry. Students were provided with resources for tutoring and counseling. Just five years after this program was established, these students were accepted into graduate programs, which included, Yale, Georgetown, and the University of Connecticut. While in Connecticut, Dr. Cobb also served as a member of the Lawrence and Memorial Hospital in New London, in addition to being elected Director of the American Council on Education, (1973-1976). Dr Cobb, as member of the National Science Board and advisor to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, chaired a conference of 30 minority women scientists to provide recommendations to schools, policy-makers and the US government on how to recruit more women of color into the sciences. The highly influential report was published as The Double Bind: The Price of Being a Minority Woman in Science. Playing these many roles, Cobb worked long hours. She did laboratory work in the early morning followed by administrative work before teaching in the afternoons.  Douglas Residential College  In July 1976, Cobb decided to leave Connecticut College and become a dean and professor of Biological Sciences at Douglass Residential College at Rutgers University. Cobb's decision to leave was not premeditated, rather it centered on an interest in becoming a full-time administrator for the Women's division of Rutgers. Cobb's greatest hesitation in leaving the College concerned her inability to continue research to the same degree in her new role. While at Douglass, Cobb (alongside nine other Americans) was selected by the Rockefeller Foundation to participate in a global conference in Italy concerning the future of higher education for women. Additionally, in April 1978, Cobb was nominated by President Carter as a member of the Board of Foreign Scholarships, best known as the organization responsible for determining Fulbright eligibility.  California State University, Fullerton  Cobb was appointed President of California State University, Fullerton in 1981 where she began to improve campus facilities from the start of her term. Cobb was successful in obtaining funds for the construction of an Engineering and Computer Science Building which was constructed with state funds, as well as the Ruby Gerontology Center, which was the first building in the College's history to be funded through private donations. She also acquired financial capital for the construction of the first ever student residence on campus. The completion of this apartment complex was later named in her honor. Cobb also negotiated an agreement with the Marriott Corporation and the city of Fullerton for a lease to construct a hotel, allowing her to use available funds for the construction of a campus sports complex. The majority of the planning for the Science Laboratory Center, now called Dan Black Hall, was done while Cobb was president. At Fullerton, some faculty members did not share Cobb's interests in research and rebuilding, holding that the primary mission of the college was to teach. Her decision to enter into the agreement to build the hotel on campus and to add a satellite campus in the southern part of Orange County thus generated criticism on campus. Cobb brought both of these issues to the Faculty Senate for a vote. Both times, her decisions were upheld. In 1990, aged 66, she was forced to retire under a rule imposed by W. Ann Reynolds, the Chancellor of the California State University System, requiring all campus presidents aged 65 or older to retire. In response to her departure, Julian Foster, a campus leader and prominent political scientist, expressed Cobb's emphasis on research and scholarship to be her most important contribution to Cal State Fullerton. Shortly after retiring, Cobb was named California State University Trustee Professor for its Los Angeles division. In 1991, she became the principal investigator at Southern California Science and Engineering ACCESS Center and Network, which assists middle school and high school students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursue a future in the fields of science and engineering. In 2001, Cobb became the principal investigator for Science Technology Engineering Program (STEP) Up for Youth‚ÄîASCEND project at California State University, Los Angeles. She also was named and served as a member of the Caltech Board of Trustees.  Research  Cobb's research included work on the relationship between melanin and skin damage, and on the effects of hormones, ultraviolet light, and chemotherapy agents on cell division. Cobb discovered that methotrexate was effective in the treatment of certain skin cancers, lung cancers, and childhood leukemia. This drug continues to be used in chemotherapy today to treat a wide range of cancers and autoimmune diseases. Cobb was the first to publish data on actinomycin D and its ability to cause a reduction of nucleoli in the nucleus of normal and malignant human cells. She received a $5,000 grant from the American Cancer Society to continue her research in\\"Direct Hormone Action to Human and Mouse Melanomas in Tissue Culture.\\" \\"Letter from American Cancer Society. \\"May 26, 1971. Plummer Cobb Jewel, Folder 1. Lear Center for Special Collections and Archives, Connecticut College, New London, CT. This grant supported her research and a broader examination of pigment cell growth and differentiation in human and mouse melanomas. Other support for her cancer research came through her post-doctoral fellowship, research grants from the: Damon Runyon, National Science Foundation, National Cancer Institute, and Public Health Services. Cobb was part of the United States International Cancer congresses in London (1958) and Moscow (1962) and served on the advisory board to Mohegan Community College. She was awarded the National Institute of Health Fellowship for $68,000, where she spent seven months in Naples, Italy continuing cell growth research at the International Laboratory of Genetics and Biophysics. Throughout her career, she collaborated with other notable researchers, including oncologist Jane C. Wright, Grace Antikajian, and Dorothy Walker Jones. Her most influential mentors were her bacteriology professor James R. Hayden and her biochemistry professor M.J. Kopac. In recognition of her research achievements, Cobb was elected to the Institute of Medicine in the National Academy of Sciences in 1974. She was also a member of the National Science Board from 1974 to 1980.  Additional societal contributions  Cobb was named Vice President of the Board for the 21st Century Foundation, dedicated to supporting the development of Black institutions that addressed issues in the Black community.\\"CC NEWS 1972\\" Plummer Cobb Jewel, Folder 1.

Programs established by the organization included: economic, educational, and community development with the purpose of creating opportunities for people of color. She was also a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which supported both women and people of color in the field.

Plummer Cob Jewel, Folder 1. Linda Lear Center for Special Collections and Archives, Connecticut College, New London, CT. She called for the equality of women, the abolition of abortion laws, and the demand for public child care in particular.  Final years and legacy  Many of the policies and programs Cobb initiated during her administrative careers take form in her 1979 paper, Filters for Women in Science, where she expressed concerns about female representation in science and engineering. Through an analogy connecting her passion for science and demand for equity, Cobb claimed that the characteristics of the filtrate passing through a filter are primarily determined by the size of the pores, which she connected with the limitations of female employment in science. Cobb's insistence on providing resources and programs to increase minority representation at her colleges of employment define her legacy outside of the laboratory.

Modelling himself on the famous French wire-walker Charles Blondin, L'Estrange performed a number of tightrope walks in the 1870s, culminating in three walks across Sydney's Middle Harbour in 1877. He remains the only tightrope performer ever to have walked across a part of Sydney Harbour. L'Estrange was an early balloonist, and attempted a series of flights in the early 1880s ‚Äì one being successful, one ending in Australia's first emergency parachute descent, and the last culminating in a massive fireball causing property damage, personal injury and a human stampede. He tried to return to his original career of tightrope walking but, with new forms of entertainment, humiliating falls and other Blondin imitators, he found success elusive. Public benefits were held in his honour to recoup financial losses and he dabbled in setting up amusement rides but ultimately he faded from public attention and was last recorded to be living in Fitzroy, Victoria in 1894. Early performances Henri L'Estrange was born about 1842 in Fitzroy, a suburb of Melbourne. Little is known of his early years, family or private life. He first came to public attention in 1873 as a member of a Melbourne performance group, the Royal Comet Variety Troupe, a gymnastic, dancing and comedic vocal combination with Miss Lulu L'Estrange and Monsieur Julian. As part of this troupe, L'Estrange performed in Melbourne and Tasmania throughout 1873 and 1874, with Henri and Lulu performing together on the tightrope. In 1876, L'Estrange performed solo for the first time in Melbourne, and quickly gained a reputation as a fearless performer. Tightrope walking had grown in popularity in Australia through the 1860s, following reports reaching the Australian Colonies of the exploits of the great French walker, Charles Blondin, who crossed Niagara Falls in 1859. By the mid-1860s, Australian wire walkers (funambulists) were modelling themselves on Blondin, copying his techniques, with several even calling themselves \\"the Australian Blondin\\". The popularity of the name surged after the original Blondin visited Australia in 1874, performing his highwire act in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. By the mid-1880s, there were at least five \\"Blondins\\" performing regularly in Sydney and elsewhere. L'Estrange began using the moniker \\"the Australian Blondin\\" from early 1876. Arriving in Sydney from Melbourne, L'Estrange erected a large canvas enclosure in The Domain and began a regular series of performances on the tightrope, copying the location and stunts of the real Blondin who had performed there in August 1874. His opening night on 26 January 1877 attracted a reported crowd of between two and three thousand people. Newspaper reports commented that his performance was so like that of the original Blondin that people could be forgiven for thinking they had seen the world-renowned rope-walker. With his rope suspended 40 feet (12 metres) above the ground, L'Estrange walked backwards and forwards, walked in armour, walked covered in a sack, used and sat on a chair, cooked and rode a bicycle, all on the rope. His show also included a fireworks display for the public's entertainment. L'Estrange performed in the Domain from January through to April 1877, but not without incident. On 7 February 1877, as L'Estrange neared the end of his wire act, sparks from the fireworks going off around him fell into the nearby store of gunpowder and fireworks, igniting them. The store's shed was demolished, a surrounding fence knocked down, part of L'Estrange's performance tent caught fire, and two young boys were injured. Sydney Harbour crossing L'Estrange, the Australian Blondin, crossing Middle Harbour in the Illustrated Sydney News 28 April 1877. In late March 1877, advertisements began to appear in the Sydney newspapers for L'Estrange's proposed harbour crossing. The first public performance was set for Saturday 31 March, with L'Estrange having organised 21 steamers to convey spectators from Circular Quay to a special landing stage close to his performance area. L'Estrange advised those wishing to see his performance to travel on his steamers as they were the only ones with permission to land passengers. This, of course this did not stop other entrepreneurs and captains from carrying spectators of their own. Whilst the event was profitable L'Estrange considered that the majority of viewers were non-paying \\"dead-heads\\". Prior to the public performance, L'Estrange undertook the crossing for a select audience including members of the press. That crossing was a success, and was well reviewed in the papers, no doubt adding to the crowd's anticipation for the Saturday show. Sadly, bad weather postponed the performance, which did not go ahead until 14 April. At 1 o'clock on Saturday 14 April, the steamers began leaving Circular Quay, conveying 8,000 of an estimated 10,000-strong crowd to Middle Harbour ‚Äì a large crowd considering the alternative attractions that day of Sydney Royal Easter Show (known then simply as \\"the Exhibition\\") and horse racing. The remainder were reported to be walking from St Leonards, with a toll being collected along the way. Spectators clambered up the sides of the bay for vantage points, while hundreds more stayed on board steamboats, yachts and in row boats below. The rope was strung across the entrance to Willoughby Bay, from Folly Point to the head of the bay, a reported length of , above the waters below. The distance meant that two ropes were required, spliced together in the centre, to reach the other side, with 16 stays fixed to the shore and into the harbour to steady the structure. The successful crossing was greeted with enthusiastic cheers, the tunes of the Young Australian Band, the Albion Brass Band and Cooper and Bailey's International Show Band, who had all come to entertain the crowds, and the shrilling of the steamers' whistles. L'Estrange soon reappeared in a small row boat to greet the crowds, although many had already rushed the steamers to leave, resulting in a few being jostled into the harbour. While the Illustrated Sydney News proclaimed it a truly wonderful feat, performed with the greatest coolness and consummate ability, not all of Sydney's press were so enthusiastic. The Sydney Mail questioned the worth of such a performance beyond the profits made, commenting that it was, \\"...a mystery to many minds why such large concourses of people should gather together to witness a spectacle which has so little intrinsic merit. There is nothing about it to charm the taste or delight the fancy.\\" Despite the criticism, L'Estrange performed at least once more at Middle Harbour, although crowds were down to a few hundred, requiring only four steamers to transport them. The same night he was guest of honour at a testimonial dinner held at the Victoria Theatre where The Young Australian Band played \\"The Blondin March\\", a piece composed specially by their conductor Mr J. Devlin. He was presented with a large gold star, engraved with a scene of his latest triumph, the date of his public performance. Measuring across, it was centred with a 1¬Ω carat diamond and suspended by a blue ribbon to a clasp featuring the Australian coat of arms in silver. An illuminated address and a bag of sovereigns, collected from his admirers, were also given. L'Estrange thereafter took his show on the road, going first to Brisbane in May 1877, and reportedly afterwards to Singapore, England and America. Ballooning In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian scene with a new performance ‚Äì gas ballooning. The first balloon ascent in Australia had been made in Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The idea that people could be lifted from the ground to fly and return safely fired the imagination of the public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very real chance of disaster and injury added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon. L'Estrange came to Sydney with his balloon in November 1878, accompanied by reports of successful flights already made in India and The Sydney Morning Herald offered a confident appraisal of L'Estrange's new venture: In a letter to the Sydney City Council, L'Estrange sought permission for the use of the Exhibition grounds in Prince Alfred Park, behind Central railway station for his first attempt.City of Sydney Archives, 2 November 1878, Letters Received 26/154/0981. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. L'Estrange struggled to fill the balloon through the afternoon of 17 November 1878, with gas supplied by the Australian Gas Light Company. By 5pm, the crowd was getting restless and L'Estrange decided to attempt liftoff, despite the balloon not being fully inflated. To lighten the load he removed the car in which he was to sit and instead sat in a loop of rope. The balloon managed only to drag him across the park before clearing the fenceline and landing on a railway truck in the yards of Central railway station next to the park. L'Estrange blamed the failure on having been supplied with \\"dense\\" gas and a filling pipe that was too narrow and leaky. L'Estrange wrote to the Council again, this time asking for permission to use Belmore Park for a second attempt.City of Sydney Archives, 21 November 1878, Letters Received 26/154/1044. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. Much like his first attempt, the second ended in failure. Once again the balloon took much of the day to fill, with the lift going ahead at 5 pm on the afternoon of 7 December 1878. The first attempt dragged him approximately through the crowd. Returning to the start point, L'Estrange tried again, shooting up into the air approximately and sailing away towards the south, before descending again and being dragged across the park. The crowd feared the balloon would crash but once more it lifted, up and over the roof of Carters' Barracks. L'Estrange, realising that the balloon was not going to lift higher, threw out the anchor, which caught in the spouting of a building and threw the balloon into the drying yard of the Benevolent Asylum, where it caught in the washing lines and wires and was practically destroyed. Still, L'Estrange's place in Sydney hearts had been established and a well-attended benefit was held at the Theatre Royal on 19 December 1878. L'Estrange survived an even more disastrous attempt in Melbourne less than six months later at the grounds of the Agricultural Society in a balloon named Aurora. Having been supplied with a much higher quality gas from the Metropolitan Gas Company he miscalculated the speed at which the balloon would ascend. Having floated much higher than originally anticipated the balloon greatly expanded and a weak seam in the calico fabric suddenly burst. L'Estrange had the presence of mind to deploy the silk parachute which slowed the rate of descent. His landing was softened by a tree and although severely shaken, L'Estrange was uninjured. The whole journey took nine minutes. The \\"catastrophe\\" was widely reported with the story appearing in local newspapers in Adelaide, Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane within the week. This was the first emergency descent by parachute in Australia, predating the Caterpillar Club by over 50 years. Despite these setbacks, L'Estrange persisted, returning to Sydney in August 1880 to prepare for another attempt. Success finally came with a flight on 25 September 1880 from Cook Park, Northwards over the Garden Palace and Sydney Harbour to Manly. Final balloon flight Buoyed by his achievement, L'Estrange set himself a second flight day in March 1881. With his reputation already well known in Sydney, and a successful flight on record, a crowd of over 10,000 turned up in the Outer Domain. As a result of high atmospheric pressure and heavy dew weighing down the balloon, inflation took longer than anticipated, and the crowd grew restless. The officer representing the company supplying the gas also refused to provide a new supply. L'Estrange was presented with what was described as a \\"Hobson's choice\\", \\"...either to abandon the attempt and risking being seriously maltreated by the mob, or proceed heavenwards without the car, accepting the attendant [risks] of such an aerial voyage.\\" He chose the latter and the lift commenced at 9.30 pm with L'Estrange sitting in a loop of rope much like his attempt three years previously. At first all seemed well, as the balloon lifted above the heads of the crowd, hovering for a moment before first heading over Hyde Park. He described the rest of his voyage in a letter to a friend: Managing to right himself, he became faint from the escaping gas and lashed himself to the ropes to prevent a fall. Realising the attempt was now a danger to himself and the balloon, L'Estrange set out the grappling hooks to catch onto something and bring the balloon down. However the ropes had become tangled and the hooks were too short. L'Estrange's balloon descended rapidly over the rooftops of Woolloomooloo, slamming into a house near the corner of Palmer Street and Robinson Lane. L'Estrange managed to disentangle himself and fell first onto a chimney then a shed below. He scrambled down from the rooftops to a waiting mob, who whisked him away to Robinson's hotel on the William Street corner and would not let him leave. At the crash site, during an attempt to free the balloon, the escaping gas was ignited when the resident of the house opened a window to see what the commotion was and the gas came into contact with the open flame of the room's chandelier. The resulting fireball destroyed the balloon, burnt a number of bystanders and was bright enough to \\"...cast a brief but vivid illumination over the entire suburb\\". A panicked crush developed as groups tried to both flee from and rush towards the brief, but extremely bright, conflagration while those further away at the launch site assumed L'Estrange had been killed. Several people were injured in the crush or burned by the fire with one lady reportedly being blinded. Although a Masonic benefit was held in his honour to try to recoup some of his financial losses, the fiasco spelt the end of L'Estrange's aeronautical career. Return to tightrope walking In a change of direction in March 1882, L'Estrange applied to the Sydney City Council to establish a juvenile pleasure gardens at the Paddington Reservoir. The fun park was to have a variety of rides, a maze, merry-go-round and a donkey racecourse. L'Estrange proposed the park to be free entry with all monies being made via the sale of refreshments on site. While he was given permission, the park does not appear ever to have opened.City of Sydney Archives, 22 March 1882, Letters Received 26/183/475. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. Studio portrait of L'Estrange demonstrating riding a bicycle on a tightrope Following the disastrous balloon attempt and the failed pleasure grounds, L'Estrange decided to return to what he knew best, tightrope walking. In April 1881 L'Estrange, given top billing as \\"the hero of Middle Harbour\\", performed at the Garden Palace on the high-rope as part of the Juvenile Fete, with other acrobats, contortionists and actors. With proof of the continuing popularity of the rope act, he decided to return to his greatest triumph; the spectacular crossing of the harbour in 1877 which had still not been repeated. On 23 December 1882, L'Estrange advised the public that he would cross the harbour once more, this time riding a bicycle across Banbury Bay, close to the site of his original success. As with his previous crossings, steamers took the crowds from Circular Quay, although this time only four were needed, while another 600‚Äì700 people made their own way to the site. The ride was scheduled for 3 pm on 23 December, but delays meant L'Estrange did not appear until 6 pm. Although the length of rope was over 182 metres, it was only just over nine metres above the water. The stay wires were held in boats on either side, with the crews rowing against each other to keep it steady. L'Estrange rode his bicycle towards the centre, where, with the rope swinging to and fro, he stopped briefly to steady himself but instead, realising he was losing his balance, he was forced to leap from the rope and fell into the water below. Although he was unhurt, it was another knock to his reputation. A repeat attempt was announced for the following weekend. Again steamers took a dwindling crowd to Banbury Bay where they found L'Estrange's rope had been mysteriously cut, and he cancelled the performance. The Daily Telegraph reported that many in the crowd, who had paid for tickets on the steamers, felt they had been scammed. Late career With his reputation in tatters after the balloon crash and the attempted second harbour crossing, L'Estrange slowly slipped out of the public eye. In December 1883 he was reported as performing again on the highwire at the Parramatta Industrial Juvenile exhibition. While his act attracted favourable publicity, \\"his efforts were not received with the amount of enthusiasm they certainly deserved\\". In April 1885 a benefit was held for L'Estrange, again at the Masonic Lodge, like the one held after his balloon misadventure. It was advertised that the benefit, under the patronage of the Mayor and Aldermen of Sydney, and with Bill Beach, world champion sculler in attendance, was prompted because L'Estrange had \\"lately met with a severe accident\\". The nature of the accident is unknown, but it is speculated to have been a fall from his tightrope, explaining the end of his performances. His apparent decline in popularity may have been as much a reflection of the public's changing taste for entertainment as it was a comment on his act. By the time L'Estrange returned to Sydney to attempt his second harbour crossing in 1882, the city was awash with Blondin imitators performing increasingly dangerous, and probably illegal, feats. At least five were performing in Sydney from 1880 under variations of the title from the \\"Young Blondin\\" (Alfred Row) to the \\"Blondin Brothers\\" (Alexander and Collins), the \\"Great Australian Blondin\\" (James Alexander), the \\"original Australian Blondin\\" (Collins), the \\"Great Australian Blondin\\" (Signor Vertelli), the \\"Female Australian Blondin\\" (Azella) and another \\"Australian Blondin\\" (Charles Jackson). In 1886 L'Estrange again applied to the Sydney City Council for permission to establish an amusement ride called \\"The Rocker\\" in Belmore Park. The Rocker consisted of a boat which, propelled by horsepower, gave the impression of being at sea. Permission was granted but like his juvenile pleasure grounds, there is no evidence that it was ever erected.City of Sydney Archives, 12 January 1886, Letters Received 26/209/0105. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. After this, L'Estrange slipped from view in Sydney. In 1894 Edwin L'Estrange \\"who a few years ago acquired some celebrity as the Australian Blondin\\" appeared in court in Fitzroy, Victoria having been knocked down and run over by a horse and buggy being driven by a commercial traveller. The driver was fined and L'Estrange's injuries are not recorded.  In popular culture  A children's book featuring L'Estrange's exploits entitledThe Marvellous Funambulist of Middle Harbour and Other Sydney Firsts was published in 2015.

Exploiting different modes of photoreversibility in this molecule allow plants to respond to different levels of light. There are three main types of fluence rate governed responses that are brought about by different levels of light. Very low fluence responses As the name would suggest this type of response is triggered by very low levels of light and is thought to be mediated by phytochrome A. It can be initiated by fluences as low as 0.0001Œºmol/m2 up to about 0.05Œºmol/m2. Germination of Arabidopsis can be induced with very low levels of red light, as can oat seedlings. Such low levels of light are sufficient for inducing this response since they only convert 0.02% of the phytochrome to its active form. The backward reaction by far red light is only 98% efficient making the conversion non-photoreversible and allowing the response to proceed. VFLRs can also be induced by making up the required fluence by brief flashes of light. Since this depends on light levels and time it is known as the law of reciprocity. Low fluence responses These responses require at least 1Œºmol/m2 to be initiated and become saturated at about 1000Œºmol/m2. Unlike VLFRs, these responses are photoreversible. This was shown by exposing lettuce seed to a brief flash of red light causing germination. It was then shown if this red flash was followed by a flash of far red light, germination was again inhibited. LFRs also follow the law of reciprocity. Other examples of LFRs include leaf de-etiolation and enhancement of rate of chlorophyll production. High-irradiance responses HIRs require long exposure to relatively high light levels. The degree of response will depend on the level of light. They are characterised by the fact that they do not follow the law of reciprocity and depend on the rate of photons hitting the leaf surface, as opposed to the total light levels. This means that neither long exposure to dim levels of light nor very bright flashes of light are enough to trigger these responses. HIR does not show red and far red photoreversibility and does not obey the law of reciprocity.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Blackburn with Darwen, the archdeaconry of Blackburn, and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It was a Commissioners' church, having received a grant towards its construction from the Church Building Commission. History The church was built between 1827 and 1829 to a design by Thomas Rickman and Henry Hutchinson. A grant of ¬£5,501 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) was given towards its construction by the Church Building Commission. The total cost of building the church was ¬£6,786 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). The foundation stone was laid on 19 July 1827, and the church was consecrated on 13 September 1829. During the 2nd World War a young Don Estelle sang in the choir as a boy soprano, he later went on to appear in the hit 1970s sitcom It Ain't Half Hot Mum and had a number one in the UK Singles Chart with Whispering Grass. The original dedication was to the Holy Trinity, but this was changed to St Peter in 1972, when its parish was merged with two other parishes. Architecture Exterior St Peter's is constructed in sandstone with a slate roof. Its plan consists of a seven-bay nave and apsidal sanctuary in one cell with a clerestory, north and south aisles, north and south porches, a north vestry, and a west tower. Its architectural style is Perpendicular. The tower is in three stages, with buttresses, and a stair turret at the northwest corner. It has a west doorway, above which is a cinquefoil window. In the top stage are five-light louvred bell openings. The parapet is battlemented with eight flat- topped pinnacles. Along the sides of the church is a plain parapet. The windows in the clerestory have flat heads and three-lights with cinquefoil heads. Along the sides of the aisles are buttresses and transomed two-light windows with cinquefoil heads containing Perpendicular tracery. In the second bay on each side is a porch with an embattled gable. The apse contains three windows similar to those on the sides of the aisles. Interior Inside the church are seven-bay Perpendicular-style arcades carried on slim piers, and galleries on three sides. The west end has been partitioned under the gallery. The alabaster reredos dates from 1923 and is a memorial to the First World War. The stained glass in the central east window is by Shrigley and Hunt and dates from 1896. There is also a window by J. Holmes dating from the later part of the 19th century. The three-manual organ was built in 1887 by Jardine. It was cleaned and overhauled in 1910 by Norman and Beard. In 1934 it was rebuilt by Binns, Fitton and Haley. There is a ring of six bells, all cast in 1831 by William Dobson.

Alvarez, 567 U.S. 709 (2012), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court struck down a portion of the Stolen Valor Act, a federal law that criminalized false statements about having a military medal. The law had been passed as an effort to stem instances where people falsely claimed to have earned the medal in an attempt to protect the valor of legitimate recipients. While a 6-3 majority of the Supreme Court agreed that the law was unconstitutional under the First Amendment's free speech protections, it could not agree on a single rationale. Four justices concluded that a statement's falsity is not enough, by itself, to exclude speech from First Amendment protection. Another two justices concluded that while false statements were entitled to some protection, the Stolen Valor Act was invalid because it could have achieved its objectives in less restrictive ways. Veteran organizations and politicians reacted negatively. Several months after the decision, both chambers of Congress passed new versions of the Stolen Valor Act based on the suggestions in the Court's opinion. Despite the Supreme Court having struck down the conviction under the Act, Alvarez remained in prison for fraud on other matters. Background Stolen Valor Act President George W. Bush signed the Stolen Valor Act of 2005, (18 U.S.C. ¬ß 704), into law on December 20, 2006. The Act broadens previous provisions addressing the unauthorized wear, manufacture, or sale of any military decorations and medals by making it a misdemeanor to falsely represent oneself as having received any U.S. military decoration or medal. If convicted, defendants may be imprisoned for up to six months, unless the decoration lied about is the Medal of Honor, in which case imprisonment could be up to one year. Proponents in Congress argued that the law was passed to prevent imposters from \\"stealing the valor\\" of soldiers returning from engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan. Alvarez's statements In 2007, at a Three Valley Water District Board meeting in Claremont, California, new member Xavier Alvarez introduced himself by saying, \\"I'm a retired Marine of 25 years. I retired in the year 2001. Back in 1987, I was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. I got wounded many times by the same guy.\\"617 F. 3d 1198, 1201-1202 (CA9 2010). As this statement was not true, Alvarez was indicted for violating the Stolen Valor Act. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, the place where the trial was to occur, rejected Alvarez's claim that the Act was unconstitutional. This decision was reversed by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which held the law invalid.617 F. 3d 1218 (CA9 2010). A rehearing en banc by the Ninth Circuit was denied over the dissent of seven judges.638 F. 3d 666 (2011). Judge Smith, one of the dissenters, argued that the panel \\"incorrectly rested its laurels on Supreme Court rulings in defamation cases that false facts did not receive First Amendment protections.\\"638 F. 3d 666, 669 (2011). Smith argued that this was not a defamation case, because even if the act was intended to prevent injury to military personnel, \\"the right against defamation belongs to natural persons, not to governmental institutions or symbols.\\"617 F. 3d at 1205 The government appealed the Ninth Circuit's decision, which was subsequently granted by the Supreme Court in 2011. Supreme Court oral arguments The Supreme Court heard oral argument on February 22, 2012.Oral Argument Transcript Donald Verrilli, Jr., Solicitor General of the United States, appeared on behalf of the United States. Jonathan D. Libby, Deputy Federal Public Defender, appeared on behalf of Alvarez. Verrilli spoke first; he began by explaining that military honors touch on the core values of the armed forces, and the Stolen Valor Act simply aims to protect those core values. Almost immediately Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Verrilli a hypothetical: Verrilli responded by suggesting that such an act would be covered by the Act only if it were \\"reasonably understood by the audience as a statement of fact or as an exercise in political theater.\\" The questions during Verrilli's argument focused on the lack of injury caused by false claims of military honors.Id. at 5. In nearly all the cases that the United States cited to support the proposition that there is no First Amendment value in falsity, the Court had addressed a false statement that harmed another, such as a defamatory statement. Relying on these cases, Verrilli stated, \\"[T]his Court has said in numerous contexts, numerous contexts, that the calculated factual falsehood has no First Amendment value for its own sake.\\"Id. at 4-5. Justice Anthony Kennedy immediately retorted: Libby opened the defense argument by emphasizing that the First Amendment is intended to protect personal autonomy. In response to several questions, Libby played on the Court's discontent with the apparent lack of harm by stating that there is value in falsity \\"so long as it doesn't cause imminent harm to another person or imminent harm to a government function.\\"Id. at 27. Libby stumbled in the Court's estimation, however, when he conceded that the Act did not chill any truthful speech. In response, Justice Kagan stated, \\"So, boy, I mean, that's a big concession, Mr. Libby. Then you're saying, you can only win this case if this Court decides that the Gertz statement was a kind of overstatement, an exaggeration, puffery.\\"Id. at 36-37. Supreme Court's decision On June 28, 2012, a divided Supreme Court held that the Stolen Valor Act's prohibition against making false statements of having been awarded a military medal violated the First Amendment. However, the six justices in the majority could not agree on a single rationale for the decision. Kennedy's plurality opinion Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for a plurality consisting of himself, Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, wrote that false statements are not, by the sole reason of their falsity, excluded from First Amendment protection. \\"The Court has never endorsed the categorical rule the Government advances,\\" Kennedy wrote. \\"Our prior decisions have not confronted a measure, like the Stolen Valor Act, that targets falsity and nothing more.\\" Even though there are several examples of the use of penalizing false speech (like perjury), Kennedy argued that \\"[t]he Government has not demonstrated that false statements generally should constitute a new category of unprotected speech...\\" The plurality opinion also expressed the wide applicability of the Stolen Valor Act. \\"The Act by its plain terms,\\" Kennedy wrote, \\"applies to a false statement made at any time, in any place, to any person\\". Such breadth means that the law is \\"sweeping... [the] reach of the statute puts it in conflict with the First Amendment... the statute would apply with equal force to personal, whispered conversations within a home.\\" When balanced against the Government's need to protect the value of the Medal, the plurality said that \\"the link between the Government's interest in protecting the integrity of the military honors system and the Act's restriction on the false claims of liars like respondent has not been shown.\\" Additionally, Kennedy wrote that 'counter-speech' was a sufficient solution to the problem: \\"It is a fair assumption that any true holders of the Medal who had heard of Alvarez's false claims would have been fully vindicated by the community's expression of outrage... Truth needs neither handcuffs nor a badge for its vindication.\\" Wrote Kennedy: \\"Permitting the government to decree this speech to be a criminal offense, whether shouted from the rooftops or made in a barely audible whisper, would endorse government authority to compile a list of subjects about which false statements are punishable. That governmental power has no clear limiting principle. Our constitutional tradition stands against the idea that we need Oceania‚Äôs Ministry of Truth,\\" invoking George Orwell's novel 1984. Breyer's concurrence Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by Justice Elena Kagan, agreed that the Stolen Valor Act was unconstitutional, but on entirely different grounds. Breyer based his finding not on a strict scrutiny test that the plurality had used, but on a \\"proportionality\\" or \\"intermediate scrutiny test\\". This test examines \\"whether the statute works speech-related harm that is out of proportion to its justifications.\\" After holding that Congress could create a database of those who had won the Medal, among other alternatives to the existing law, Breyer said that there were lesser restrictive means to achieve the government's interest. Alito's dissent Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, dissented from the Court's decision striking down the Act. For Alito, the ruling had \\"[broken] sharply from a long line of cases recognizing that the right to free speech does not protect false factual statements that inflict real harm and serve no legitimate interest.\\" \\"The Stolen Valor Act,\\" Alito wrote, \\"represents the judgment of the people's elected representatives that false statements about military awards are very different from false statements about civilian awards... [the Act] is a narrow law enacted to address an important problem, and it presents no threat to freedom of expression.\\" Subsequent developments Reaction The decision received praise on constitutional grounds from across the political spectrum. The First Amendment Center called the decision \\"a victory for free speech and common sense.\\"http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/stolen-valor- ruling-a-win-for-free-speech-common-sense Several veterans organizations leaders were dismayed by the decision. A spokesperson for the Veterans of Foreign Wars said \\"Despite the ruling, the VFW will continue to challenge far- fetched stories, and to publicize these false heroes to the broadest extent possible as a deterrent to others.‚Äù Harold A. Fritz, a recipient of the medal from the Vietnam War, agreed with the VFW that \\"It‚Äôs more than just a piece of metal suspended on a piece of cloth on a pin. . . . And people who abuse that . . . need to be penalized.\\" Proponents of the Stolen Valor Act promised to bring forward more limited legislation in the future. The American Legion expressed hope that a narrower law would survive constitutional scrutiny. \\"We felt good about portions of the decision which suggest that a more narrowly tailored bill which incorporates traditional fraud elements would be upheld,\\" said Fang Wong, national commander of the American Legion.http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/judicial/story/2012-06-28/supreme- court-stolen-valor/55895020/1 Alvarez's attorney praised the decision, saying \\"The First Amendment protects a lot of what we as Americans get to say...The government doesn't get to decide what we can and cannot say.‚Äù Aftermath Alvarez remained in legal trouble due to allegations that he defrauded the government by falsely receiving health insurance benefits. He was convicted of misappropriation of public funds, grand theft, and insurance fraud in 2009 and sentenced to five years in state prison, and was discharged in March 2012 from Calipatria State Prison. Revised Stolen Valor Act In 2012, an effort was initiated to revise the Stolen Valor Act to comply with the Supreme Court's decision.

John Hinkston. A famous \\"Indian fighter\\", he was on numerous occasions the hero of attacks against pioneer settlements, was dispatched on many expeditions, and was involved in many other aspects of the New West. Biography Haggin was born in 1753, in Winchester, Virginia, son of Samuel Haggin and Mary Florence Fairfax. He moved to western Pennsylvania, where he married Agness Nancy Gibbs (later fathering twelve children). He served in Dunmore's campaign in 1774. He went to Kentucky the following spring, one of the first settlers of the state. The next year he brought out his family and built a cabin on Hinkston's fork of the Licking River, but because of Indian hostilities he removed that summer to McClelland's Station, on the site of the modern Georgetown. He was camped with a group of \\"long rifles\\" on the site of present-day Lexington, Kentucky when they received news of the inauguration of the American Revolutionary War. The hunters named their encampment Lexington, after the Battle of Lexington. Haggin was very politically active in the movement toward Kentucky statehood and was a judge on the first Kentucky Court of Appeals. Court records show that John Haggin had a racetrack in Harrodsburg before 1785, as there were prosecutions for disorderly behavior there, well before better known claims to the first racetrack in Kentucky (those made for William Whitley, who opened a track in 1788 in Lincoln County, and a Lexington track which opened in 1789). Haggin's track was thus one of the earliest if not the earliest racetrack in Kentucky. By the time of his death he had acquired vast land holdings and great wealth. Unlike some of his fellow entrepreneurial contemporaries, he was seen as honorable and industrious and apparently instilled those values in his offspring.

In order to make use of all musicians in the Philharmonic as often as possible, Hattner often uses Romantic music and symphonies and ballets from the early 20th century in his programs. The Philharmonic began offering chamber orchestra concerts during his tenure. Style and interests Hattner has said of his conducting style, \\"It is generally somewhat of a collaborative process between myself and the musicians, having been a player myself. I'm fairly specific about what I'm asking for in terms of the tempos and the phrasing, but bits of individual expression comes from the hearts and minds of the players themselves. I don't try to micromanage every detail.\\" In addition to conducting and clarinet performance, Hattner has participated in multimedia work with silent film both nationally and internationally. He continues to perform clarinet in ensembles such as 45th Parallel, Martingale Ensemble and other projects.Sources for Martingale Ensemble: Sources for other projects: See also * List of clarinetists * List of Northwestern University alumni * Music education for young children * Music education in the United States References External links * Video: David Hattner's appearance on Oregon Public Broadcasting's Oregon Experience Living people 20th-century American conductors (music) 21st-century American conductors (music) 21st-century clarinetists American clarinetists American male conductors (music) Aspen Music Festival and School alumni Bienen School of Music alumni Interlochen Center for the Arts alumni Musicians from Toledo, Ohio Portland Youth Philharmonic conductors Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"David Hattner"},{"id":"34122783","text":"Sam Hanna Bell (19091990) was a novelist, short story writer, playwright, and broadcaster who lived in Northern Ireland. He was born in Glasgow to Ulster Scots parents. Following the death of his father he was brought at the age of seven to be reared in the Strangford Lough area of County Down, where his acclaimed novel of Ulster rural life, December Bride (1951), would be set. He moved to Belfast in 1921, where he worked at a variety of manual jobs before securing a post with the BBC in 1945. He was a co-founder of the left-leaning literary journal Lagan in 1943. His first collection of short stories, Summer Loanen and other stories, was published in 1943. His novels include December Bride (1951), The Hollow Ball (1961), A Man Flourishing (1973) and Across the Narrow Sea (1987). Bell was recruited to the BBC, in 1946, along with fellow writer, W.R.Rodgers, by the Irish poet and radio producer, Louis MacNeice. (Sean MacMahon, 1999, Sam Hannah Bell: a biography, Belfast: The Blackstaff Press, page 44). Some of his work as a radio producer was highly innovative. 'This is Northern Ireland, An Ulster Journey' of 1949 is a classic radio feature incorporating actuality, poetry, music and narration. in later work Hanna Bell incorporated the voices of 'ordinary people' in his attempt to paint a picture of Ulster as rooted in the lives and traditions of its people. His collaboration with W.R.Rodgers, The Return Room (1955) is one of the most important post-war Irish radio features and shows the influence of Dylan Thomas on Rodgers the poet. Along with his BBC colleague John Boyd, the essayist (and anti-Partition activist) Denis Ireland, actors Joseph Tomelty and J. G. Devlin, poets John Hewitt and Robert Greacen, and the Rev. Arthur Agnew, in the 1940s Bell was one of an intellectual set, \\"the club of ten\\" Linen Hall Library members that used to meet weekly next to the library in Campbell's cafe. In 1977 he was honoured with an MBE in recognition of his contribution to the cultural life of Northern Ireland. December Bride was made into an acclaimed film in 1990. Reviewing the film, Irish Times columnist and literary critic Fintan O'Toole said it was \\"not just a remarkable artistic achievement, but also a remarkable political one...restoring a richness and complexity to a history that has been deliberately narrowed\\". In April 1999 December Bride was selected by award-winning novelist and critic Colm T√≥ib√≠n and publisher, writer and critic Carmen Callil for inclusion in The Modern Library: The 200 Best Novels in English Since 1950 (Picador). Sam Hanna Bell died in 1990 just before the premiere of the film of December Bride. On 15 October 2009, a blue plaque was unveiled by Northern Ireland Culture Minister Nelson McCausland on the Belfast house where Sam Hanna Bell wrote December Bride. (Such plaques are erected to commemorate and honour notable people.)

In December 1971 the Proteas embarked on a six-match tour of Britain and Holland ‚Äì the first \\"Coloured\\" rugby team to tour abroad. Arriving on the 13th, they were met at the airport by protesters from anti- apartheid movements. The Proteas lost their first match 3‚Äì14 to Hertfordshire at Croxley Green on 16 December, after the home side had led 10‚Äì3 at half- time. A fight broke out during the game, which the press blamed on the Proteas' tactic of tackling at head height. The tour ended with a 33‚Äì3 loss to the United Hospitals on 2 January 1972 in London. Cuthbert (Charles) Loriston, the Proteas' team manager and SARFF's first president, explained that the purpose of the tour was \\" 'to test our strength' \\". He said that the two wins, a draw, and three losses proved that \\" 'we have the technical know-how and enthusiasm to build strong opposition within the next five years' \\". The wins came against county side Oxfordshire (33‚Äì5) and a London team (19‚Äì12). Loriston said that the next steps would be to play against white teams that tour South Africa, such as England's intended visit the next year; to play white South African teams; and then move towards integration of sports. He concluded that the Proteas had found, despite their initial scepticism, that they were treated \\" 'differently than...at home' \\". The first of Loriston's next steps was duly made on 22 May 1972 when the Proteas side lost narrowly (6‚Äì11) to John Pullin's touring England side in Cape Town. England had undertaken a short, unbeaten seven match tour to the Republic and whilst the headlines in the UK were undoubtedly linked to his side's 18‚Äì9 test match victory, the Proteas versus England fixture remains the first reported international rugby match in which coloureds played against whites on South African soil. The Sunday Times later reported that the showings of both the Proteas side and the black's Leopards side (who lost considerably more heavily against England two days later in Port Elizabeth) \\" gave the lie to the oft- repeated claim in South Africa that no blacks are ready for a trial against the top local white players.\\" Sunday Times 4 June 1972 and 16 July 1972 On Tuesday 4 June 1974 the Proteas played against the touring Lions side at Goodwood Showground in Cape Town. Fly-half Errol Tobias scored the only points (a penalty and a drop-kick) for the Proteas, who were beaten 6‚Äì37 by the visitors. The team included Hennie Shields, John Noble, Turkey Shields, and Doug Dyers. For the Lions, centre Dick Milliken, wing J. J. Williams, lock Gordon Brown, flank and captain Fergus Slattery scored a try each. Fullback Andy Irvine (a conversion, three penalty kicks) and fly-half Alan Old (two penalties) also contributed. 1974 also saw the Proteas compete against the Leopards in what have been referred to as two mini tests in Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth, respectively. 1975 saw the French undertake an eleven match tour to South Africa which included two tests. They played their third tour fixture against the Proteas at Goodwood in Cape Town on 4 June 1975 winning by a comfortable 37‚Äì3 margin. It was perhaps the events that unfurled at Newlands some three days which resonated louder when a South African Invitation XV,the first official mixed-race team (containing white, black and coloured players) ever fielded in South Africa ran out 18‚Äì3 winners against the touring side. Strand prop Turkey Shields and Stellenbosch's try-scoring wing, John Noble represented the Federation in the victorious Invitation XV. During the 1976 All Black tour of South Africa, the Proteas were defeated 3‚Äì25 by the tourists on a wet 7 July at Goodwood Oval in Cape Town before a crowd of 10,000. The full-strength All Black team included players such as Laurie Mains, Bill Osborne, Sid Going, Andy Leslie, Frank Oliver and Lawrie Knight. Among the Proteas were John Noble and Charles Williams (who would later go on to represent the South African Barbarians side who toured Britain in 1979). Billy Beaumont's British and Irish Lions touring side of 1980 defeated a Proteas XV 15‚Äì6 in front of a crowd of 15,000 at the Danie Craven Stadium on 27 May 1980. The nomenclature Proteas XV is of import here and the distinction is made since whilst the Proteas' running backline included notable SARFF star players such as Ronnie Louw, John Noble, Hennie Shields, Charles Williams, Frankie Davids, Errol Tobias (who notched two penalties on the day) and Attie Lategan, the Proteas' forward pack's front five was composed entirely of white Western Province players. A similar arrangement had been witnessed when the Lions played a Leopards XV bolstered by numerous WP and Northern's personnel a little under two weeks earlier in the tour match in Border and signified recognition that the touring party had expressed a commitment that it would not compete against teams overtly selected on racial grounds alone. Within four months, the Federation's star outside half, Errol Tobias was included in the Springboks' Tour party to South America and 30 May 1981 saw Tobias become the first non-white to be capped when he was selected at outside centre in the 12‚Äì10 defeat of Fergus Slattery's Irish touring side.

It was launched on 1 February 2015 and almost immediately shut down. The channel was owned by Saudi prince and entrepreneur Al-Waleed bin Talal, and was based in Manama, Bahrain. Creation In July 2010, Prince Al-Waleed, owner of a stake in News Corporation, planned to collaborate with News Corp to launch a 24-hour Arabic-language news channel. After a year of deliberation, Al-Waleed announced on 13 September 2011 the launch of Alarab as a personal private venture. He said the channel's editorial stance would be \\"inspired by the recent political events that have transformed the region, with particular attention to be paid to freedom of speech.\\" The channel was supposedly entirely privately funded, with Al-Waleed insisting that it would not receive instructions from the Saudi government. At the time of the launch, no mention was made of News Corp's involvement. In December 2011, Manama, Bahrain, was chosen as the network's headquarters. Doha, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Beirut were also among the cities considered to host the network. Prince Al-Waleed retained close ties with the Bahraini royal family while his Kingdom Holding Company maintains a presence in the country through indirect investments in the banking sector. Al-Arab was launched on 1 February 2015. Al-Arab's regional competitors were Qatari-owned Al Jazeera and Saudi-government-owned Al Arabiya, along with BSkyB's Sky News Arabia. In a January 2012 interview, Al-Waleed described Al Jazeera as the \\"masses channel\\" while implying that Al Arabiya is the \\"government channel\\" among the two main news channels in the Middle East. He stated his goal for Al-Arab to \\"takes the centre‚Äôs point of view\\" between the two networks. Ownership and management Al-Arab was privately owned by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, independent from Kingdom Holding Company and Rotana Group, two corporations controlled by the prince. It was headquartered in Manama's Media City complex. The channel was based outside Saudi Arabia as the country does not allow independent news channels to operate within its borders. The channel's director was Jamal Khashoggi, former editor of Al Watan, a newspaper in Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi was removed as editor in 2010 after Al Watan published an article criticizing Salafism, the fundamentalist Islamic movement that is Saudi Arabia's official state religion. The channel partners with US financial news channel Bloomberg Television, which would have provided five hours of daily programming, including financial bulletins, analysis, reports on regional business leaders, and global financial news. The partnership would have brought al-Arab into direct competition with Arabic-language financial news channel CNBC Arabiya. Censorship and shutdown On 1 February 2015, al-Arab's first day of programming included an interview with Bahraini Shi'a politician and former member of the Council of Representatives, Khalil al-Marzooq, who discussed the cancelling of 72 Bahrainis' citizenship. Broadcasting was suspended after the interview. Al-Arab stated that the suspension was for \\"technical and administrative reasons\\", while the newspaper Akhbar al-Khaleej attributed the suspension to al-Arab \\"not adhering to the norms prevalent in Gulf countries\\". The shutdown of Al Arab TV was a result of the media censorship vigorously enforced by the ruling regime, where any criticism of the absolute monarchy or the mention of Shia majority oppression is not tolerated.

Mirsky's theorem is named after him. Biography Mirsky was born in Russia on 19 December 1918 to a medical family, but his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle, a wool merchant in Germany, when he was eight. His uncle's family moved to Bradford, England in 1933, bringing Mirsky with them. He studied at Herne Bay High School and King's College, London, graduating in 1940. Because of the evacuation of London during the Blitz, students at King's College were moved to Bristol University, where Mirsky earned a master's degree. He took a short- term faculty position at Sheffield University in 1942, and then a similar position in Manchester; he returned to Sheffield in 1945, where (except for a term as visiting faculty at Bristol) he would stay for the rest of his career. He became a lecturer in 1947, earned a Ph.D. from Sheffield in 1949, became senior lecturer in 1958, reader in 1961, and was given a personal chair in 1971. He retired in September 1983, and died on 1 December 1983. Mirsky was an editor of the Journal of Linear Algebra and its Applications, the Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications, and Mathematical Spectrum. Research Number theory Mirsky's early research concerned number theory. He was particularly interested in the r-free numbers, a generalization of the square-free integers consisting of the numbers not divisible by any rth power. These numbers are a superset of the prime numbers, and Mirsky proved theorems for them analogous to Vinogradov's theorem, Goldbach's conjecture, and the twin prime conjecture for prime numbers. With Paul Erd≈ës in 1952, Mirsky proved strong asymptotic bounds on the number of distinct values taken by the divisor function d(n) counting the number of divisors of the number n. If D(n) denotes the number of distinct values of d(m) for m ‚â§ n, then :D(n) = \\\\bigl(1+o(1)\\\\bigr)\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{8\\\\log n}}{\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\log\\\\log n}\\\\right). The Mirsky‚ÄìNewman theorem concerns partitions of the integers into arithmetic progressions, and states that any such partition must have two progressions with the same difference. That is, there cannot be a covering system that covers every integer exactly once and has distinct differences. This result is a special case of the Herzog‚ÄìSch√∂nheim conjecture in group theory; it was conjectured in 1950 by Paul Erd≈ës and proved soon thereafter by Mirsky and Donald J. Newman. However, Mirsky and Newman never published their proof. The same proof was also found independently by Harold Davenport and Richard Rado.. Linear algebra In 1947, Mirsky was asked to teach a course in linear algebra. He soon after wrote a textbook on the subject, An introduction to linear algebra (Oxford University Press, 1955), as well as writing a number of research papers on the subject. In his research, Mirsky provided necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of matrices of various types (real symmetric matrices, orthogonal matrices, Hermitian matrices, etc.) with specified diagonal elements and specified eigenvalues. He obtained a tightening of the Birkhoff‚Äìvon Neumann theorem with H. K. Farahat stating that every doubly stochastic matrix can be obtained as a convex combination of permutation matrices. In Mirsky's version of this theorem, he showed that at most n^2-2n+2 permutation matrices are needed to represent every n\\\\times n doubly stochastic matrix, and that some doubly stochastic matrices need this many permutation matrices. In modern polyhedral combinatorics, this result can be seen as a special case of Carath√©odory's theorem applied to the Birkhoff polytope. He also worked with Hazel Perfect on the spectra of doubly stochastic matrices. Combinatorics In the mid 1960s, Mirsky's research focus shifted again, to combinatorics, after using Hall's marriage theorem in connection with his work on doubly stochastic matrices. In this area, he wrote the textbook Transversal Theory (Academic Press, 1971), at the same time editing a festschrift for Richard Rado. He derived conditions for pairs of set families to have simultaneous transversals, closely related to later work on network flow problems. He also was one of the first to recognize the importance of transversal matroids, and he showed that transversal matroids can be represented using linear algebra over transcendental extensions of the rational numbers. Mirsky's theorem, a dual version of Dilworth's theorem published by Mirsky in 1971, states that in any finite partially ordered set the size of the longest chain equals the smallest number of antichains into which the set may be partitioned. Although much easier to prove than Dilworth's theorem, it has many of the same consequences.

The organization's restated mission is \\"to empower people who live and work on the margins of society.\\" , Conard House web site Resources in support of this mission include supportive housing, case management, psychiatric rehabilitation, harm reduction, supported employment, money management and computer technology training. Together, these resources are generally referred to as community supported self-management.  History  Conard House was founded in 1960 by Elaine Mikels (1921-2004), who, with her mentor, Conard Rheiner, believed that people learning to live with, or recovering from, mental illness needed not only housing appropriate for their needs but additional outpatient therapeutic, social rehabilitation support and long-term stability in order to reintegrate into the local community. With the opening of Jackson Street in 1960, Conard House assumed a leading role in the deinstitutionalization movement in the United States with one of the first halfway houses in California, and nationally, for patients discharged from state mental institutions, in this case Napa State Hospital. These halfway houses became the early model for newer federal supportive housing designs, such as Housing First, to address chronic homelessness. Supportive Housing Conard House owns, leases and manages 35 residential properties that provide various in-home supportive services, resource linkages and services coordination. Residents, many previously chronic homeless and experiencing serious mental illness, acquire tenancy and can voluntarily access the many resources offered. Conard House owns 9 residential hotels, master-leases 3 other single room occupancy (SRO) hotels and numerous scattered-site residential cooperatives. These include SROs contracted under San Francisco Proposition N (2002) Care Not Cash welfare reform program for homeless single adults, many with dual diagnosis. In all, this housing provides 725 permanent supportive housing units throughout San Francisco. Taken together, these supportive housing programs incorporate a Housing First approach to homelessness. Case Management Many people with serious mental health and medical acuities, especially those with dual diagnosis, often have difficulty taking care of their basic needs, experiencing impairments to one or more daily life functions. Case managers provide client-centered services, helping with budgeting, facilitating support groups and assisting residents and clients with access to critical resources. Residents in the cooperatives live independently, and are provided with social rehabilitation, mental health counseling and support through the clinical headquarters, located in the historic Jackson Street building in Pacific Heights. Supportive Employment Conard House provides vocational assessment, counseling, job training, placement and employment retention services for residents moving through different stages of recovery. Supportive housing residents are employed in a variety of property management, clerical, janitorial and courier positions. Another component of supportive employment is placement of residents in pre-vocational volunteer positions with other service providers linked into local systems of care. As well, residents are transitioned into permanent part- and full-time employment with mainstream employers. Supportive employment is important for the Jackson Street Co- Operative program because of its requirement that clients secure employment within three months of entering the program. Community Service Centers Conard House operates four community service centers offering critical services for resident and non-resident community members throughout San Francisco. The centers have provided money management and social support services to thousands of San Francisco residents through the years, supplementing the agency's primary supportive housing programs for single adults who have experienced chronic homelessness and mental health barriers. Financial management of federal, state and county disability benefits is an evidence-based practice which acts as an eviction prevention strategy to reduce recidivism, keeping at-risk and vulnerable residents housed. Broadband Technology In 2010, Conard House, as a sub-recipient under San Francisco Department of Aging and Adult Services, received federal reinvestment act money under the Broadband Technology Opportunity Program (BTOP). Following the goals of BTOP, Conard House has used this money to create computer training centers, infrastructure and increase sustainable broadband access among Conard House residents. The computer centers are free for all residents and clients of Conard House and offer classes and general computer support. The intended goal of this program is bridging the digital divide by increasing self-sufficiency through computer literacy in a society that is becoming rapidly dependent on broadband technologies.

Assisting the minister of defense, a military non-professional, Grigoryants was simultaneously named to the post of first deputy defense minister. His formal position was changed to head of the general staff and first deputy minister of defense soon after, when the position of the overall Armenian Army commander was phased out in the course of the ongoing military reform, but he remained a key figure in organizing the Armenian military into an effective force and developing the country's military doctrine.

He is a member of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea, vice-chairman of the National Defence Commission of North Korea and vice-marshal of the Korean People's Army. He is the second oldest member of the central leadership of North Korea after Kim Yong-ju. Biography Youth Ri was born in South Pyo'ngan Province, Pyo'ngso'ng in Japanese-occupied Korea. He attended the second central political school. Kim Il-Sung era (1948-1994) After the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea he was named military attache to the North Korean embassy in the People's Republic of China. In 1964 he was made first vice-chairman of the Politburo of the Korean People's Army (not to be confused with the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea) and promoted to lieutenant general. At the 5th Congress of the Workers' Party in 1970 he was elected to the Central Committee. In 1973 he was promoted to general and made chairman of the Politburo of the Korean People's Army. He was subsequently elected to the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea in 1974. Ri was purged in 1977 and demoted to a low administrative position. He was however rehabilitated a decade later and made an alternate member of the 6th Central Committee in 1988, to be finally restored to full central committee member in 1989. Kim Jong-Il era (1994-2011) Ri was elected to the National Defence Commission in 1998, being also promoted to the second highest military rank of vice-marshal. He was reelected in 2003 and 2009. As the Workers' Party politburo, central military commission and central committee were de facto suspended under Kim Jong-Il's \\"military first\\" policy from 1994 to 2010, the National Defence Commission became in practice the highest decision-making body in the country and Ri hence part of the innermost circle of power. When in 2010 Kim Jong-Il revived Workers' Party operations after 16 years of dormancy, Ri was also elected to the politburo. Kim Jong- Un era (2011-) Upon the death of Kim Jong-Il in 2011, Ri was ranked 13th in the funeral committee. This presumably corresponds to his ceremonial rank in the top leadership at that time. Ri retained his place in the Politburo at the 4th Party Conference in 2012, and was reelected to the National Defence Commission by the 2014 Supreme People's Assembly.

Three aircraft were built, each with different engine or wing positions, but no production followed. Design and development G√ºnther P√∂schel designed the Equator as a small executive transport which could operate from land or water. It used the then quite novel glass-fibre composite material for the skin of its flying surfaces and fuselage in order to achieve a smooth and watertight finish. The first version to fly, the P-300 Equator, was completed as a landplane with a fixed undercarriage and was intended to provide proof of principle. It had a high, cantilever wing of straight tapered plan and no dihedral, carrying a full span combination of ailerons and slotted flaps. These surfaces replaced the original full span flaps plus lateral control spoilers, which were found ineffective. Despite its landplane configuration, this first aircraft had the small outboard floats intended for production amphibians; these rotated to the wingtips in flight and remained rotated for land operation. The P-300 Equator's fuselage was a composite skinned, metal semi-monocoque structure. The cabin extended from near the nose to just aft of the wing leading edge. Three rows of seats were enclosed by a long, smooth windscreen and two long side transparencies which hinged upwards for access, with two smaller windows behind. The most unusual feature of the P-300 was its engine and propeller layout: the six cylinder, 310 hp (230 hp) Lycoming TIO-541 was placed within the fuselage behind the cabin, with a long drive shaft extending aft to the tail. The P-300 had a T-tail and the drive shaft first turned through 90¬∞upwards into it, then turned again to emerge from a slender fairing at the fin/tailplane intersection, where it drove a two blade, tractor configuration propeller. The tail was unswept, carrying horn balanced elevators and rudder. The fixed, tricycle undercarriage had short, almost horizontal, cantilever main legs; all wheels had fairings. The prototype P-300 was exhibited at the June 1973 Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport. The P-300 was followed by the P-400 Turbo-Equator, powered by a 313 kW (420 hp) Allison 250-25-B17B turboprop engine. Lighter and small in diameter than the Lycoming, this engine was mounted on a revised, cruciform, tail at the fin/ tailplane intersection, driving a three blade propeller. A new, all-moving tabbed tailplane was fitted and the rudder had gained a trim tab. The displacement of the engine from the fuselage enabled another row of seats to be added, making eight places in all. The cabin had a glazed door in place of the P-300's hinged transparencies. The wings had the same plan and dimensions as before but were fitted with the earlier, full span spoilerons. The wingtip floats were removed and the aircraft stabilized on water with short fuselage mounted sponsons. A retractable tricycle undercarriage was fitted, the wheels housed within the fuselage. The P-400 first flew on 24 August 1977 but was destroyed during its eighth land take-off when the propeller went into reverse pitch. The final Equator, numbered P-300 like the first, reverted to Lycoming piston power but with the engine mounted in pusher configuration on a pylon above the fuselage and wing, partly to allow later models to use different engines or even to have two engines in push-pull configuration. The sponsons were removed and wing roots were lowered to below mid-fuselage line and dihedral added, stabilizing the aircraft on the water with a \\"water-wing\\", the centre section undersides in contact with the water, an idea developed by the US Navy and used in the Taylor Coot homebuilt amphibian. The earlier upright fin was replaced by a wide chord, swept but still cruciform tail. The new wing position resulted in a revision of the cabin side transparencies, with three well-spaced square windows on each side. Cabin access was via a portside door. Some water trials had been made by March 1981 and one P-300 is known to have flown from land. Many variants were proposed but not proceeded with.

The practice focuses on promotion, maintenance and restoration of health, prevention of illness and injury, and protection from work‚Äêrelated and environmental hazards. Occupational health nurses (OHNs) aim to combine knowledge of health and business to balance safe and healthful work environments and a \\"healthy\\" bottom line.American Association of Occupational Health Nurses. (2012). \\"AAOHN Fact Sheet\\". Retrieved on October 24, 2013: www.aaohn.org Job Functions Occupation health nursing can be found in almost every major healthcare facility. Saldana, Pimentel, and Posada (2019) describe occupation health as a niche in nursing that specializes in assessing and evaluating the \\"health status\\" of employees and function to maintain the highest level of well-being of the workforce. The key components of occupational health nursing involves prevention of illness and injury in the workplace, health and wellness, protection, and education (McCullagh & Berry, 2015). Nurses in occupational health also have a role in implementing research projects and incorporating evidence based practice into clinical practice (Saldana et al., 2019). Occupational health nursing is an important niche and works to protect and promote the wellbeing of the community and workforce (Saldana et al., 2019). KWiggancsu  In the United States  In the United States the role of the occupational health nurse started in 1888. A nurse named Betty Moulder was hired by multiple coal mining companies in Pennsylvania to take care of their employees and families because of the conditions at the workplace. Because of this many people consider Pennsylvania as the birthplace of occupational health nursing Through the years occupational health nursing grew in order to fight against infectious diseases and health issues related to labor shortages. Today employees with poor health will cost companies one trillion dollars. Occupational health nurses are hired by companies within the United States in order to decrease job related injuries and absentee percentages. According to the CDC (2017), studies have shown that occupational health nurses provide significant financial benefits to employers and their employees. As of 2012, there were approximately 19,000 occupational health nurses in the U.S.Thompson, Margaret, and Wachs, Joy. (2012). \\"Occupational Health Nursing in the United States,\\" Workplace Health & Safety (60)3: 127-133 Occupational health nurse training in the U.S. is supported by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health through the NIOSH Education and Research Centers.  Roles and Responsibilities  Modern roles of Occupational Health Nurses are as diverse as clinicians to educators. As the profession progresses the responsibilities of this profession have also grown. Some of the areas that occupation nurses are responsible for but are not limited to: Case Management: OHNs routinely coordinate and manage the care of ill and injured workers. Occupational Health Nurses role as case managers has grown as they now assist with the coordination and management of work-related and non-work related injuries and illness, which includes group health, worker's compensation and Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) as well as short/long term disability. Health Promotion and risk reduction: OHNs develop programs that promote lifestyle change and individual efforts that lower risk of disease and injury. OHNs also assist in creating environments that provide a sense of balance among work, family, personal, health and psychosocial concerns. Additional strategies to assist in health promotion to keep workers healthy and productive include immunizations, smoking cessation, exercise/fitness, nutrition and weight control, stress management, chronic disease management, and use of medical services. Counseling and crisis intervention: Occupational Health Nurses (OHNs) offer counseling to workers for many issues. They provide counseling for common challenges such as work-related issues and injuries (American Association of Occupational Health Nurse [AAOHN], n.d.). They also provide counseling for other issues such as substance abuse, psychological issues, concerns for health and wellness, etc. (AAOHN, n.d.). OHNs can also manage employee assistance programs, take charge of referrals, and coordinate follow-up of community resources (AAOHN, n.d.). (apaulCSU) Workplace hazard identification: OHNs can detect hazards or potential hazards in the workplace. They are able to conduct research in order to monitor, evaluate, and analyze certain hazardous elements (AAOHN, n.d.). Conducting research assists in developing a safety plan and implementing preventative and control measures (AAOHN, n.d.). Examples of workplace hazards include toxic chemical exposure, confined spaces, frayed cords, infectious material exposure, extreme heat/cold conditions, and injuries such as falls. It is important to detect patterns and implement changes to promote a safer workplace environment. (apaulCSU) American Association of Occupational Health Nurses. (n.d.). What is occupational and environmental health nursing. Retrieved from http://aaohn.org/page/profession-of-occupational-and-environmental-health- nursing (apaulCSU).  Requirements  Occupational Health Nurses need a license in the state they practice. Nurses usually have a baccalaureate in nursing and experience in community health, ambulatory care, critical care or emergency care (Wachs, 2017). Most occupational health nurses get their master‚Äôs degrees in public health, advanced practice or business to have a higher professional competency (Wachs, 2017). Nurses can get certified in occupational health nursing through The American Board for Occupational Health Nurse, INC (Wachs, 2017).  Future of Occupational Health Nursing  Occupational Health is projected to grow by 12% 2022 (McCauley & Peterman, 2017). Health and wellness in the workplace areas becoming more important than ever. Healthcare reform is set to improve access to deliver healthcare services for all individuals (McCauley & Peterman, 2017). The demand for occupational health nurses will increase due to the reform. Workplaces today have rising insurance costs and worker compensation cases, this creates a need for qualified occupational health nurses who understand the healthcare market (Peckham et al., 2017). Most cooperation‚Äôs have incorporated a wellness program to help decrease employee related injury and illness (Peckham et al., 2017). Also, many companies are taking precautions to prevent lawsuits.

Additionally the concept highlights ethnographic findings that, in a wide swath of human societies, people understand, conceptualize and symbolize their relationships predominantly in terms of giving, receiving and sharing nurture. The concept stands in contrast to the earlier anthropological concepts of human kinship relations being fundamentally based on \\"blood ties\\", some other form of shared substance, or a proxy for these (as in fictive kinship), and the accompanying notion that people universally understand their social relationships predominantly in these terms. The nurture kinship perspective on the ontology of social ties, and how people conceptualize them, has become stronger in the wake of David M. Schneider's influential Critique of the Study of KinshipSchneider, D. (1984) A Critique of the Study of Kinship. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. and Holland's subsequent Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship, demonstrating that as well as the ethnographic record, biological theory and evidence also more strongly support the nurture perspective than the blood perspective (see Human inclusive fitness). Both Schneider and Holland argue that the earlier blood theory of kinship derived from an unwarranted extension of symbols and values from anthropologists' own cultures (see ethnocentrism). Intellectual background Reports of kinship ties being based on various forms of shared nurture date back at least to William Robertson Smith's (1889) compiled Lectures on The Religion of the Semites: At this stage, Robertson Smith interpreted the kinship ties emerging from the sharing of food as constituting an alternative form of the sharing of substance, aside from the sharing of blood or genetic substance which many anthropologists (e.g. Lewis H. Morgan) assumed was the 'natural basis' of social ties. However, later observations focused on the nurturing qualities of food-sharing behavior, allowing a potential distinction between the earlier emphasis on kinship as shared substance (e.g. food or blood) and kinship as performance (of care-giving or nurturing behaviors): Sometimes the line between conceiving of kinship as substance or as nurture is blurred by using both concepts. For example, the substance of food or milk may be conceived as the medium or vehicle through which the nurturing behavior is performed (e.g. Strathern 1973). The notion that it is the nurturing acts themselves that create social ties between people has developed most noticeably since the 1970s: The term \\"nurture kinship\\" may have been first used in the present context by Watson (1983),Watson, J. (1983) Tairora culture: Contingency and pragmatism.Seattle: University of Washington Press. who contrasted it with \\"nature kinship\\" (kinship concepts built upon shared substance of some kind). Since the 1970s, an increasing number of ethnographies have documented the extent to which social ties in various cultures can be understood to be built upon nurturant acts.Holland, Maximilian. (2012) Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches. North Charleston: Createspace Press. Ethnographic examples Marshall on the Truk (now known as the Chuuk) of Micronesia: Gow on the Piro of Amazonia: Thomas on the Temanambondro of Madagascar: Storrie on the Hoti of Venezuelan Guiana: Viegas on a Bahian Amerindian Community in Brazil: Link with attachment theory It can be seen from the ethnographies that several anthropologists have found that describing social ties in terms of emotional attachments is appropriate. This has prompted some to suggest that an inter-disciplinary collaboration might be useful: Within the discipline of psychology, the formation of social and emotional ties are treated by attachment theory. Drawing on animal studies from the 1950s onwards, John BowlbyBowlby, J. (1982) Attachment, 2nd edition. Vol. 1. London: Hogarth. and colleagues described how‚Äîfor all primates, including humans‚Äîthe reliable provision of nurture and care leads to strong bonds of attachment between the carer and cared-for. Following the nurture kinship approach thus allows a synthesis between the extensive cross-cultural data of ethnographers and the long-standing findings of psychology on the nature of human bonding and emotional ties. Link with evolutionary biology David Schneider suspected that the traditional anthropological models of blood kinship were not mirrored by the \\"scientific facts of biology\\". Holland subsequently showed that Schneider's intuition in regard to the 'scientific facts' was correct. In evolutionary biology, the theory treating the evolution of social cooperation emerged in a formal version in the 1960s and 1970s in the form of inclusive fitness theory, and a related theory, kin selection. The theory specifies that one criterion for the evolution of certain kinds of social traits is a statistical association of identical genes, as would exist when close genetic relatives associate with one another. Early applications of the theory applied to humans (darwinian anthropology) took as their starting position the former anthropological perspective that human kinship is fundamentally \\"based on\\" blood-ties. However, these extensions emerged at precisely the time that anthropology was reflexively critiquing this \\"blood\\" assumption behind traditional kinship theorizing. This reversion to \\"blood\\" led some anthropologists to strongly attack the emerging biological perspectives as suffering the same ethnocentric assumptions (e.g., \\"blood is thicker than water\\") that the anthropologists themselves had recently eschewed. This clash of perspectives led to something of a stand-off and a lack of communication between the disciplines, resulting in little cooperation and progress for three decades. The stand-off was resolved by Holland's Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship which re-visited biological inclusive fitness theory to draw a distinction between the statistical evolutionary mechanisms for the emergence of social traits and the non-deterministic proximate mechanisms through which they are expressed. In a strict interpretation of the theory, a statistical association of related genes (as would be present in the interactions of close genetic relatives) is understood as a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for the evolutionary emergence of certain traits relating to social cooperation (see kin selection). However, this does not entail that the proximate mechanisms governing the expression of such social traits in primates and humans necessarily depends on (or are determined by) conditions of genetic relatedness per se. For the vast majority of social mammals‚Äîincluding primates and humans‚Äîthe formation of social bonds (and the resulting social cooperation) are based on familiarity from an early developmental stage, and the same kinds of mechanisms that attachment theorists (see above) have outlined. In short, in humans and in other primates, genetic relatedness is not necessary for the attachment bonds to develop, and it is the performance of nurture that underlies such bonds and the enduring social cooperation that typically accompanies them (see Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship). Therefore, the nurture kinship perspective leads to the synthesis of evolutionary biology, psychology, and socio-cultural anthropology on the topic of social bonding and cooperation, without reductionism or positing a deterministic role to genes or genetic relatedness in the mechanisms through which social behaviors are expressed. Alternative perspectives and critiques In all of the above examples that are argued to support the 'nurture kinship' perspective, alternative interpretations may be equally persuasive or more insightful. In many such small communities, which may be isolated (such as the ones of the Chuuk of Micronesia), the relatedness between members of a group is to be assumed. This may also be the case for an amerindian tribe, (such as the Hoti of Guyana, and the Bahian Amerindians). So it can be argued that those bonds of affection are what naturally link parents to children exactly because of their existing relatedness. In many of these cases, even if 'symbolic valuation' (and explicit recognition) of blood is not present, most of the time nurturing may anyway be concentrated between (blood) siblings (e.g. the Piro of Amazonia). In the case of the Temanambondro of Madagascar, as in the above case of the Navajo, nurturing is a complementary element of kin-familial and social life and not an antithesis of it. Likewise, in the Bahain Amerindian (Brazil) case of fostering, the recognition of their legitimate parents does not cease to be made, and it is not rejected. Such attachment is only seen, however, in the perspective of the offspring, rather than in the one of the progenitors. These samples show common elements between them but also with cases in other, including Western civilizacional (where milk or breastfeeding siblings and exposed children were common for centuries), similar cases where children are not able to be nurtured by their own birth parents but are nurtured by someone else, but they do not say in themselves that parents in general are not attached, in normal conditions, to their offspring, or if that is a common situation. It should also be noted that these ethnographic examples correspond to a small minority of the World's population. In many cultures, people often value and even pay respect to deceased ancestors they never met, as well as a beloved parent they don't know without being his or her fault. Also, feelings towards relatives should be seen as a more personal and individual issue and particular circumstances be hold into account instead of a common whole-group mentality. Situations where the bond between kindred is broken are also the exception rather than the rule. Overall the 'nurture kinship' perspective does not necessarily mean that human non-blood relationships such as the relationships based on nurturing are more important than the ones based on blood-kinship, since their motivation is also related to one's survival and perpetuation, or that people are necessarily bond to the culture they are inserted in, nor can it be generalized to the point of claiming all individuals always undervalue blood- kinship in the absence of nurturing. Herbert Gintis, in his review of the book Sex at Dawn, critiques the idea that human males were unconcerned with parentage, \\"which would make us unlike any other species I can think of\\". Therefore, the nurture kinship perspective enables common ground between evolutionary biology, psychology, and socio-cultural anthropology on the topic of social bonding and cooperation, without reductionism or positing a deterministic role to genes or genetic relatedness in the mechanisms through which social behaviors are expressed.

Washington stated that Nelson was his most favored horse to use during the Revolutionary War, as he was not easily provoked by gunfire. Washington rode Nelson when accepting Cornwallis' surrender at Yorktown. The other horse he rode during the Revolutionary War, and on whom he is more often portrayed, was his gray horse, Blueskin.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Whalley, the archdeaconry of Blackburn, and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. It was a Commissioners' church, having received a grant towards its construction from the Church Building Commission. History The church was built between 1827 and 1829 to a design by Thomas Rickman and Henry Hutchinson. A grant of ¬£5,534 () was given towards its construction by the Church Building Commission. The cost of construction of the church was ¬£5,496. It was restored and altered in 1897‚Äì99 by Austin and Paley who created a chancel by raising the east end, and building a screen and furnishings for the choir. Architecture Exterior St Mary's is constructed in sandstone with a slate roof. Its plan consists of a six-bay nave with a clerestory and a continuous chancel, north and south aisles, and a west tower. The tower is in three stages with angle buttresses. There is a west door above which is quatrefoil in a circular surround. There are single-light windows in the middle stage, and the bell openings in the top stage also have a single light. The tower is surmounted by a needle spire, set back from the parapet. It contains openings under gablets. In the angles between the tower and the nave are single-storey projections with buttresses and single-light west windows. The bays along the walls of the aisles are separated by buttresses, and each bay contains a pair of lancet windows. The clerestory bays also contain paired windows. In the angles between the aisles and the chancel are more single- storey projections. On each side of the chancel are single-light windows, and the east window consists of five stepped lancets. Interior Inside the church are five-bay arcades with pointed arches carried on piers consisting of four clustered columns. There is a west gallery with carved traceried panels that contains an organ. Between the nave and the altar is a screen that incorporates a pulpit on its northern side. The font is in white marble, and has a carved cover including a pyramidal spire with angels. The stained glass includes windows in the south aisle by Capronnier dating from the later part of the 19th century, and a window in the north aisle dated 1928 by Whitefriars. There are also two windows from the early 20th century that are possibly by Shrigley and Hunt. The three-manual organ was built by Renn and Boston, and was extended in 1897 by Edwin Smith of Blackburn.

The project organizers invited input broadly from many sectors in planning to establish the EGF. The project was also presented as a cultural investment towards strengthening national identity by contributing to global research. At the time, many research teams were organizing similar projects, but this project was projected to be the world's largest. An early goal of the project was to collect biological specimens and health data from 70% of Estonia's population of 1.4 million within its first 10 years. By 2004 the EGF had collected data from 10,000 people, and faced fiscal reorganization as they and their primary financier, EGeen, dissolved their partnership. As of February 2014 the project had collected genes, questionnaire data on health (e.g. diet, lifestyle and clinical diagnoses) and GP standard health examinations from 52,000 adult gene donors and the aim had been adjusted downwards to collect genealogical, genome and health data from 5% of the population.

Terzuola is an American knife maker who popularized the type of knife known as the tactical folding knife. Early life Terzuola was born in Brooklyn, New York on 14 September, 1944. He attended Stuyvesant High School where his academic achievements earned him a full scholarship to New York University where he studied vocational education. Upon graduation in 1966 he joined the Peace Corps and went to Panama as a volunteer for two years, after which he was invited to become a Peace Corps trainer in Puerto Rico. He worked as a field supervisor for several experimental education projects in Guatemala and in the mid-eighties, directed the War Damage Surveys in El Salvador and Guatemala for AID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance. Terzuola taught himself jade carving and became General Manager of a Jade Jewelry company in the town of Antigua,Guatemala. By 1980, Terzuola began making knives professionally while managing the Jade business and that same year joined the Knifemakers' Guild on an endorsement from Bob Loveless. Terzuola has also enjoyed membership in the German and Italian Knifemakers Guilds. Knifemaking Terzuola's first knives were fixed blade, combat designs, made for soldiers, CIA operatives and security personnel working in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. In 1984 he relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico and began making folding knives. Seeing a need for a knife that could be carried discreetly he developed a model using black micarta for scales and bead- blasted titanium frames; for this effort he coined the term \\"Tactical Knife\\". Terzuola's most popular model is the ATCF (Advanced Technology Combat Folder), a linerlock folding knife. This was his first tactical folding knife, although he makes it with non-tactical materials on occasion with ivory or stag scales and damascus steel blades. He is widely considered to be the first maker and ‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù of tactical folding knives. Terzuola has authored a book about the design of tactical knives which was updated and expanded in the 2019 edition. He has authored articles about tactical knives and knifemaking for Blade, Soldier of Fortune and other publications. In 2008 he relocated his shop to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Terzuola has collaborated with other knifemakers and production companies including Spyderco, Strider Knives, and Microtech Knives. Terzuola's first factory collaboration was with Spyderco to produce the C-15 model in 1989. This knife became historic because it was the first liner lock system folder produced by a commercial factory, was the first production knife to use G-10 scales and ATS-34 steel, the first production knife to have parts blanked by laser instead of stamping and the first knife to be produced by a new, start-up company named \\"Benchmade\\". In 2016, Bob and his wife Suzi moved his home and shop to San Diego, California where he continues to hand-make high quality folding and fixed blade knives.

Research Interests  The fastest super- shear cracks on Earth: Bimaterial delamination; shear rupture of a graphite composite; and rupture of a frictional interface simulating a laboratory earthquake.Professor Rosakis is the author of more than 260 works on quasi- static and dynamic failure of metals, composites, interfaces and sandwich structures, with emphasis on the use of high speed visible and IR diagnostics and laser interferometry for the study of dynamic fracture and dynamic localization. His early work includes the study of dynamic, ductile failure of structural metals by using high speed photography, the real-time measurement of temperature fields at the vicinity of dynamically growing cracks and adiabatic shear bands and the development of a variety of optical and dynamic infrared diagnostic methods. He and his coworkers invented Coherent Gradient Sensing, CGS, interferometry, a method sensitive to gradients of optical path gradients which has been used in both fracture mechanics and thin film stress measurements at the wafer level. Other interests include dynamic fragmentation; shear dominated intersonic rupture of inhomogeneous materials and composites, rupture mechanics of crustal earthquakes, shielding of spacecraft from hypervelocity micrometeoroid impact threats, the reliability of thin films and wafer level optical metrology. Professor Rosakis holds thirteen US patents on thin-film stress measurement and in situ wafer level metrology as well as on high speed infrared thermography. In the late eighties, Rosakis introduced the concept of \\"laboratory earthquakes\\" and since then his research interests have mainly focused on the mechanics of seismology, the physics of dynamic shear rupture and frictional sliding and on laboratory seismology. The goal of this body of work is to create, in a controlled and repeatable environment, surrogate laboratory earthquake scenarios mimicking various dynamic shear rupture process occurring in natural earthquake events. Such, highly instrumented, experiments are used to observe new physical phenomena and to also create benchmark comparisons with existing analysis and field observations. The experiments use high-speed photography, full-field photoelasticity, and laser velocimetry as diagnostics. The fault systems are simulated using two photoelastic plates held together in frictional contact. The far field tectonic loading is simulated by pre- compression while the triggering of dynamic rupture (spontaneous nucleation) is achieved by suddenly dropping the normal stress in a small region along the interface. The frictional interface (fault) forms various angles with the compression axis to provide the shear driving force necessary for continued rupturing. Rosakis and his co-workers, investigate the characteristics of rupture, such as rupture speed, rupture mode, associated ground motion under various conditions such as tectonic load, interface complexity and roughness. Both homogeneous and bimaterial interfaces (abutted by various elastic and damaged media) are investigated. Rosakis and his coworkers have been credited with the experimental discovery of the \\"intersonic\\" or \\"supershear rupture\\" phenomenon. They also have investigated this new phenomenon in various engineering and geophysical settings involving shear dominated rupture in the presence of weak interfaces or faults. Their experimental discoveries of supershear rupture has refocused the attention of the geophysics community to the study of supershear earthquakes. Another recent research interest for Professor Rosakis is hypervelocity impact. Hypervelocity impact is a rising concern in spacecraft missions where man-made debris in low Earth orbit (LEO) and meteoroids are capable of compromising or depleting the structural integrity of spacecraft. To address these concerns, the goal of current research is to experimentally investigate the underlying mechanisms responsible for deformation and damage evolution during hypervelocity impact utilizing Caltech/JPL's Small Particle Hypervelocity Impact Range (SPHIR) facility. By combining high speed photography, optical, spectroscopic and infrared techniques, including Coherent Gradient Sensing (CGS) interferometry, the dynamic perforation behavior involving crater morphology, debris and ejecta formation and solid/fluid/plasma transitions and interactions have been examined.

In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \\"five‚Äìfor\\" or \\"fifer\\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement. As of January 2020, 156 cricketers have taken a five- wicket haul on their debut in a Test match, with nine of them being taken by New Zealand cricketers. They have taken a five-wicket haul on debut against six different opponents: three times against England, twice against Pakistan, and once against India, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe each. Of the nine occasions, New Zealand won the match four times, drew three times, and lost twice. The players have taken five-wicket hauls at nine different venues, including six outside New Zealand; the most recent was taken at Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium, Abu Dhabi. The first New Zealand player to take a five-wicket haul on Test debut was Fen Cresswell who took six wickets for 168 runs against England in 1949. Cresswell, Alex Moir and Colin de Grandhomme are the only bowlers to have taken six wickets each on debut. Six other players have taken five wickets on their Test debut. De Grandhomme took six wickets for 41 runs, the best bowling figures by a New Zealand bowler in an innings on Test debut, against Pakistan in 2016, at Hagley Oval. He accumulated seven wickets for 64 runs in the match, the best bowling figures by a New Zealander in a Test match on debut. De Grandhomme and Ajaz Patel are the only players to get the man of the match award on their Test debuts. Amongst the bowlers, Bruce Taylor is the only player \\"to achieve the all-round feat\\" on his Test debut against India in 1964‚Äì65 at Eden Gardens, Calcutta; he scored 105 runs and took 5 wickets for 86 runs. Paul Wiseman's five-wicket haul is the most economical, with 1.75 runs per over, and Tim Southee has the best strike rate. As of November 2018, the most recent Zealand cricketer to achieve this feat was Ajaz Patel. Moir, Wiseman and Patel are the only spin bowlers to achieve this feat, the others being fast bowlers.

Its focus is on encouraging pluralistic discourse in the South Caucasus, including the countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. Its goal is to promote inclusive policy-making in Armenia through conducting research, producing and advocating policy documents and encouraging a pluralistic and informed public policy debate. The Institute is located in downtown Yerevan. It was first founded in 2002 as the Caucasus Media Institute and then, in 2008, was renamed to Caucasus Institute. The Caucasus Institute organizes its trademark event, the Annual Caucasus Conference, an international event that brings together experts from the South Caucasus (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia), Russia (including the Northern Caucasus), Turkey, the U.S. and the EU to assess and discuss the situation with governance, transition and development in the region. The event is followed by the publication of CI Caucasus Yearbook in Russian, summing up the events of the yesteryear in the region. The yearbook contains the results of research on nation-building, democratization, development, regional and European integration of the Caucasus. History The Caucasus Institute was founded in 2002 by a group of professionals who had worked in journalism, social sciences and media development in various post-Soviet countries. The Caucasus Media Institute was partly rooted in another project in the 1990s called the Caucasus Media Support Project (CMSP): a conflict resolution project implemented by journalists. Initiated from Geneva by Vicken Cheterian, and funded by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, its aim was to create contacts and exchanges between journalists from the various conflict regions of the South Caucasus and to give them an opportunity to report from the \\"other side\\". The assumption was that if a journalist visit an \\"enemy territory\\", they will be capable of more balanced or at least more nuanced reporting. During the CMSP, journalists from Abkhazia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Karabakh and South Ossetia took part in twelve meetings held in various towns of the South Caucasus. Although the project was a diplomatic success, it also showed the limits of journalism in the region. Journalists engaged in the project displayed great courage by daring to travel to the \\"other side\\". Yet, the media coverage that came out of such rich occasions was often thin, failing to capture to the experience in all its complexity and flavour. Another project that crystallized ideas behind the CMI was Central Asia Media Support Project (CAMP), similar to the CMSP, carried out in Central Asia countries sharing the sublime, yet highly tense Fergana Valley, including Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. CAMP aimed at using journalism to raise awareness of the social, economic, demographic and other sources of tension in Fergana. The three founder of the Caucasus Media Institute were all engaged in the CAMP, getting rich insight into the mechanisms and limitations post Soviet media culture. The readiness of Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation to support a media development initiative gave the possibility to design the precise content of the initiative. During 2001, the founders conducted needs- assessment missions in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, looking at media development and its resources. in late 2001, SDC agreed to fund the project, and in February 2002 Vicken Cheterian moved from Geneva to Yerevan and started the logistic preparations together with Mark Grigorian. In April 2002, Alexander Iskandaryan and Nina Iskandaryan joined the team by moving to Yerevan from Moscow. The Main Training Programme started in October 2002, with twelve novice journalists coming from three countries- Armenia, Moldova and Russia (Republic of Chechnya). The students took courses and did internships at local media organizations combining schooling and practice. From its first year, CMI was more than a journalism school. The work of the Research and Publication unit focused on issues of regional interest, including elections, migration, religion and politics, nation building and conflict resolution. Though based in Yerevan, CMI began to operate on a regional scale using a multicultural approach to education. It had interns from various countries, including the U.S., the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland, and students from Armenia, Georgia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Jordan, Southern Russia (Chehcnya, Daghestan, Karachevo-Cherkessia, Karbadino-Balkaria and North Ossetia) and de facto states such as Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh and South- Ossetia. For the 2003 parliamentary and presidential elections, the CMI published trilingual elections guides (Armenian, English, Russian) for journalists and observers. The CMI soon started working on photojournalism. In 2003, the Amsterdam-based World Press Photo (WPP) partnered with the CI to bring its yearly exhibition to Armenia for the first time and in 2004, the cooperation was developed into yearly courses. CI invited renowned Armenian photojournalist Ruben Mangasaryan to supervise the courses with the methodological support of WPP; world-famous photo-journalists came to Yerevan and taught classes to CMI students, and the WPP exhibition visited Armenia three more times. The project brought a new visual culture to Armenia and formed a new approach to photojournalism among the young generation. Ruben prematurely died in March 2009 yet the impact of the work he did will persist for decades. In 2004, the CMI launched a unique format of Yearly Caucasus Conferences which analyse regional developments of the previous year. The papers presented in these conferences are collected and published in a special series called the Caucasus Yearbook. Fourteen volumes of the Caucasus Yearbook have already been published, providing rich analytical material and information about the current history of the region. The Yearly Conferences and the Caucasus yearbook series constitute part of the CMI efforts to develop Caucasus Area Studies. In 2008, the direction of the CMI decided to rename the institute to simply the \\"Caucasus Institute\\" or CI, to reflect it diverse activities, including research on contemporary politics, Caucasus area studies, advocacy and consulting.

He originally started his career working for Kaientai Dojo in Japan, where he became a one-time Strongest-K Champion and a three-time Strongest-K Tag Team Champion alongside Ryota Chikuzen, Kengo Mashimo and Miyawaki. After his release from WWE, he returned to Japan as Kazma Sakamoto, working as a freelancer for Kaientai Dojo, Pro Wrestling Zero1 and Wrestle-1. In 2015, he signed with Wrestle-1. Professional wrestling career Kaientai Dojo (2003‚Äì2011) Kazma was trained by Taka Michinoku at his Kaientai Dojo wrestling school and made his debut for the promotion on 3 May 2003. In 2005, Kazma took on Taka Michinoku for the Strongest-K Championship and a few days later took part in the Strongest-K 2005 tournament and would lose both. In 2005, under the guidance of former Far East Connection manager, 296, Kazma formed a stable along with Kengo Mashimo called Kinnoutou and started to dominate, eventually taking on Ryota Chikuzen and Kunio Toshima as well. Mashimo and KAZMA were very successful as a group, Mashimo and Kazma went on an undefeated streak since the formation of Kinnoutou and did not drop a fall until well after he left the group. Kengo Mashimo and KAZMA won the first Strongest-K Tag Team tournament and were crowned the first ever Strongest-K Tag Team Champions. The two began dominating the tag team scene in K-DOJO as they also won the UWA and UWF Intercontinental Tag Team championships, absorbing them into the Strongest-K Tag Team championship. When K-DOJO split its roster into two, Kazma, along with the rest of his Kinnoutou allies were drafted to GET. Early 2006 saw Mashimo and KAZMA lose their first ever tag match together, losing the STRONGEST-K Tag Team titles in February to Makoto Oishi and Shiori Asahi. After losing, signs of friction started to grow in Kinnoutou with Kunio Toshima's sense of justice saving TAKU Michinoku from a Kinnoutou attack. In the beginning of 2007, Kazma began teaming up with Taka Michinoku and together participated in Strongest-K Tag League 2007 and reached the finals before they were eliminated by Makoto Oishi and Shiori Asahi. In March, Kazma defeated MIYAWAKI to become the number one contender for the Strongest-K Championship and a month later took on former Kinnotou member Kengo Mashimo for the championship and lost. Kazma teamed up with Ryota Chikuzen to take on MIYAWAKI and YOSHIYA for the Strongest-K Tag Team Championship and lost. In summer 2007, Kazma participated in STRONGEST-K Tournament 2007 and reached the semifinals before being knocked out of the competition. On 4 September 2007, Kazma and Chikuzen defeated MIYAWAKI and Naoki Tanizaki to become the Strongest-K Tag Team Champions and held the titles for about a month before losing them to Kengo Mashimo and Madoka. KAZMA, Kengo Mashimo and Ryota Chikuzen teamed up to defeat JOE, TAKA Michinoku and Taishi Takizawa in Ryota Chikuzen K-DOJO retirement match and with Chikuzen leaving, Kinnotou was no more. In the beginning of 2008, Kazma teamed up with Taishi Takizawa and lost in the first round of the KAIENTAI DOJO Tag League 2008. With this loss Kazma teamed up with Yuji Hino to take part in the same tournament and reached the final before being eliminated by Kengo Mashimo and Madoka. After the tournament, Kazma joined the stable OMEGA and for most of the first part of 2008 teamed up with members of OMEGA to take part in tag team matches against rivals Handsome and Slum. On 20 June 2008, Kazma and MIYAWAKI defeated Handsome members, JOE and Taka Michinoku, for the Strongest-K Championship. After winning the championships, Kazma participated in the STRONGEST-K Tournament 2008 and in the first round, Michinoku would get his revenge by knocking Kazma out of the competition. In August, Kazma and MIYAWAKI lost the tag team championship to the former champions. He would eventually leave the stable to form a new one with former Kinnotou member, Kengo Masimo. Along with Kazma and Kengo Masimo, Kaji Yamato, Daigoro Kashiwa and Hiro Tonai were also part of Monster Plant. For most of 2009, Kazma would take on members of other stables and factions in both singles and tag team match ups. In the STRONGEST-K Tournament 2009 he would lose to Daigoro Kashiwa in the semifinals. Kazma would take part in two tournaments in quick succession, the first being a one-day three-way tournament, which was won by Yuji Hino, and Strongest-K Tournament 2009, where he was eliminated by Kashiwa in the semifinals. On 17 October 2009, Kazma would finally defeated Taka Michinoku to become Strongest-K Champion. He went on to team up with Tonai in the KAIENTAI DOJO Tag League 2010 and earned four points which two other teams in block A had also and therefore took part in a decision three-way won by Shiori Asahi and Yuji Hino. Throughout 2009 and 2010 Kazma would defend his championship on multiple occasions and always retaining it until 15 August 2010, where he lost it to Yuji Hino. With the loss of his title Monster Plant would disintegrate, leaving Kazma on his own. With no stable or faction Kazma would be alone and his prospects would suffer as a result. Throughout 2011, Kazma had multiple opportunities to become a champion or the number one contender and lost all of them. Kazma and HARASHIMA would lose to Hiroki & Kengo Mashimo for the Strongest-K Tag Team Championship. Kazma also lost his rematch for the Strongest-K Championship. In the summer of 2011, he participated in number one contendership for the Strongest-K Championship in battle royals and other types of match ups. In the Strongest-K tournament Kazma would gain a total of six points in block B which was not enough to progress to the semifinals. Kazma's last match for Kaientai Dojo came on 10 September 2011, he teamed with Shiori Asahi and lost to Hiro Tonai and Taishi Takizawa. WWE (2011‚Äì2013) In the summer of 2011, he went on an excursion to North America and was subsequently signed to a developmental contract by WWE and assigned to their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling under the name Sakamoto. Sakamoto made his FCW debut on 4 December 2011 alongside fellow K-Dojo alum Jiro in a loss against the team of Big E Langston and Nick Rogers. Sakamoto went on to lose every televised FCW match he participated in, including defeats to Dean Ambrose and Mike Dalton. On 26 March 2012, Sakamoto made his first appearance on WWE television in a vignette for the re-debuting Lord Tensai. Sakamoto made his debut on the 2 April 2012 episode of Raw as the follower of Tensai. Sakamoto would aid Tensai by interfering in his matches and attacking his adversaries. From June, with Tensai losing more frequently, he would often vent his frustrations by abusing and attacking Sakamoto, who would remain loyal to his master. By September, Tensai stopped appearing with Sakamoto, who disappeared from television. Following his disassociation from Tensai, Sakamoto returned to WWE's developmental territory, the former FCW, which had been rebranded into NXT Wrestling; he made his NXT debut on the 16 January 2013 episode, losing to Adrian Neville. While facing Briley Pierce on the 8 May episode of NXT, both men were attacked by Conor O'Brian; this led to both men challenging O'Brian to a handicap match during the next episode, which O'Brian won. On 17 May 2013, Sakamoto was released; his last match was a battle royal on the 29 May episode of NXT (which was taped before his release) to determine the #1 contender for the NXT Championship where he and Pierce were the first men eliminated from the match courtesy of Mason Ryan. Return to Japan (2013‚Äìpresent) On 11 June 2013, Kazma, billed under the ring name Kazma Sakamoto, returned to Japan at a Pro Wrestling Zero1 event, where he announced that he would be taking part in the 2013 Fire Festival. On 15 July, Sakamoto wrestled his first match since his WWE release, when he defeated Tank Nagai at a Kaientai Dojo event. Sakamoto finished his Fire Festival on 4 August with a record of two wins, one draw and two losses, failing to advance to the finals of the tournament. On 15 September, Sakamoto made his debut for Wrestle-1, teaming with Ryoji Sai in a tag team match, where they defeated Ryota Hama and Yasufumi Nakanoue. Sakamoto replaced an injured Kohei Sato as a member of a heel stable named Desperado, led by Masayuki Kono, and later in the event helped Kono defeat Masakatsu Funaki. Back in Kaientai Dojo the following day, Sakamoto and Kengo Mashimo defeated Daigoro Kashiwa and Ricky Fuji to win the Strongest-K Tag Team Championship. They lost the title in their first defense on 10 November to the team of Kaji Tomato and Taka Michinoku. On 11 January 2014, Sakamoto made his debut for Wrestling New Classic (WNC), defeating Masaya Takahashi, after which he challenged and attacked WNC Champion Tajiri. This led to a title match between the two on 30 January, where Tajiri retained his title. Through Wrestle-1's working relationship with American promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), Sakamoto worked TNA's Bound for Glory event in Tokyo on 12 October, losing to MVP. On 30 January 2015, Sakamoto received his first title shot in Wrestle-1, when he and Desperado's newest member Koji Doi unsuccessfully challenged Kaz Hayashi and Shuji Kondo for the Wrestle-1 Tag Team Championship. On 26 June 2015, it was announced that Sakamoto had signed with Wrestle-1, officially ending his days as a freelancer. Shortly afterwards, Sakamoto became the new leader of Desperado, after kicking Kono out of the group. Under the new leadership, the stable was renamed \\"Real Desperado\\" on 13 October. On 3 November, Sakamoto, Koji Doi and Nosawa Rongai defeated Jackets (Jiro Kuroshio, Seiki Yoshioka and Yasufumi Nakanoue) for the UWA World Trios Championship. They lost the title back to Jackets on 27 November. On 6 March 2016, Sakamoto and Real Desperado's newest member Yuji Hino defeated Masayuki Kono and Shuji Kondo for the Wrestle-1 Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to Yasufumi Nakanoue and Yuji Okabayashi on 8 June. On 31 August, Sakamoto's contract with Wrestle-1 expired and he became a freelancer once again. Other media Sakamoto appeared on the 81st episode of Zack Ryder's YouTube show, Z! True Long Island Story, in a segment called \\"Where's Trent?\\".

History A manor house was built at Bishopstrow in the late 18th century, between the Salisbury road and the River Wylye, but this was destroyed by fire in 1817. The present-day house was then begun on the north side of the road, nearer to the escarpment of Salisbury Plain, and was completed by John Pinch the elder in 1821. The gardens of the earlier house were retained and are linked to the new site by a tunnel under the road. In 1950 the house was bought by W. Keith Neal, a firearms collector, and in 1976 it was purchased by Kurt Schiller, who the next year turned it into a ten-bedroom hotel. It has since been extended to provide more rooms. In 1988 the hotel was bought by the Blandy family, owners of the five-star Reid's Hotel and winery in Madeira. In 1995 it was again sold; in 2001 it became part of the Von Essen hotels group, and in 2011 part of the Longleat Hotel Group. In 2018, the hotel was bought by Frank Mountain's Versant Developments. The house is set in grounds of some twenty-seven acres. As of 2001 it had twenty-four double bedrooms, six suites, and two family rooms. The River Wylye runs through the grounds, and a summerhouse and a boathouse stand alongside it. The grounds also contain two ancient burial mounds: a long barrow and a bowl barrow.

Governance of Hydropower in Scandinavia  National governments in Scandinavia consult with all stakeholders affected by hydropower plants. The interaction between stakeholders on hydropower projects in Norway can be classified as participatory governance. After the Scandinavian countries de-regulated their markets, they connected their individual markets into one common market, Nord Pool Spot. The energy that is not traded through the market is traded through contracts between suppliers, retailers and consumers.Nord Pool Spot. (2011) The power market - how does it work, Nord Pool Spot, Nord Pool Spot, [Online] [Accessed on 16/12/2011] http://www.nordpoolspot.com/How-does-it-work/  Sweden  The Swedish electricity market was deregulated in 1996, transforming the industry from a government hierarchical system to a governance steering structure.Palm, J. (2008) ‚ÄòEmergency management in the Swedish electricity market: the need to challenge the responsibility gap,‚Äô Energy Policy, vol. 36, issue. 2, pp. 843-849 The law stated that ‚Äòpower trading and network operations may not be conducted by the same organisation but numerous organisations thus the production and trade of electricity became competitive. The industry would be regulated by public authorities, the Energy Market Inspectorate within the Swedish Energy Agency. Its responsibilities included monitoring network tariffs and ensuring that network operators do not subsidise other interests.  Denmark  Most of Denmark's hydropower electricity comes from Norway and Sweden, supplied partly through Nord Pool Spot. Denmark has increased its renewable energy sources (wind and biomass) from approximately 0% in 1970 to 20% in 2005, which leaves them on target for the RES directive. Wind share was 39% in 2014.Rasmussen, Jesper N√∏rskov. \\"Vindm√∏ller slog rekord i 2014 \\" Energinet.dk, 6 January 2015. Accessed: 6 January 2015.  Norway  The different levels of governance in Norway concerning hydropower can be seen through the economic interests, and the social responses, to the installation and expansion of hydropower projects. = Local level = At the local level hydropower can have an enormous effect on communities; creating employment, improving infrastructure, and building new or enhanced roads. However, some communities can be resistant to hydropower, especially when local incomes are dependent on tourism. For example, fishing is an important recreational sport in Norway; and hydropower may prevent local people from participating. Also the installation of hydropower upon historic sites, and areas of natural beauty, is other major concern. Local communities have been known to bring in NGO's such as WWF Norway, or Friends of the Earth, in order to resist the installation of hydropower plants.Knudsen, J. K., Ruud, A. (2011) Changing currents in Norwegian hydropower governance? The challenge of reconciling conflicting interests, Oslo: SINTIF, (TR A7111), pp. 1-84 = Regional = The municipality's response to hydropower typically represents the response of local communities. Municipality must manage the concerns of the stakeholder's communities, energy companies and NGO's regarding the installation of hydropower plants. Various municipalities have shares and direct ownership of hydropower companies. Energy companies rely on municipalities to provide information on the local environment, and cooperate to create environmental impact assessments. This can involve numerous municipalities, as the watercourse may flow through several municipalities, and therefore are bound by regulations to work together on hydropower projects. Hydropower companies pay fees to the local municipalities in the form of taxes and license fees. Smaller hydropower plants are exempt from taxes in order to economically stimulate local development. The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) determines the license fees paid to municipalities by hydropower companies. The NVE assess various factors such as degree of environmental disturbance and the profitability of the project. = National level = Hydropower has long been \\"associated with a nation-building process, representing the key infrastructure for economic growth and welfare, through electrification\\". In 1991 Norway de-regulated its market and these institutions became the network for governing hydropower in Norway: * The Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (MoPE): Energy policy of Norway, and thereby also the policies affecting hydropower. * The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE): (Provides licences for hydropower plant projects) Managing Norway's water resources; promoting an efficient energy market and cost-effective energy system; and promoting efficient energy use. * The Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management (DN) (Executive and advisory body for the MoPE): nature protection and management, the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, as well as outdoor recreation. * The Norwegian Climate and Pollution Agency (KLIF): The regulation of pollutants related to energy production, or other factors affecting the chemical composition of watercourses. * Directorate for Cultural Heritage (RA): the cultural landscape and provides for hearing comments on hydropower projects. = International level = * The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) provide the license for the Nord Pool Spot to organise and operate a market place for trading power. The Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (MoPE) to facilitate the power market with foreign countries. * Norway has been in negotiations with the EU commission to agree on a national target for the EU Renewable Energy Source (RES) directive. A draft has been produced giving Norway a target of 67.5% by 2020. This is higher than any other country in the EU. * Norway's commitment to this regulation was one of the principles required by Sweden for the joint certificate scheme. *\\"Norway and Sweden signed a protocol on the fundamental principles and the further follow-up of the common green certificate scheme. At the same time, a proposal for a Norwegian act on the system ‚Äì reflecting the current Swedish legislation and the protocol, was forwarded to a public consultation. In April 2011, the Government put forward a proposal for a law based on the consultation. The law is expected to be adopted by the Parliament in near future in order to ensure an implementation from January 2012.\\" = Participatory governance example = * For the implementation of large hydropower plants in Norway numerous stakeholders need to be consulted: * NVE conducts the initial assessment, consider the need for impact assessments, and coordinate different inputs and viewpoints received through the public consultations. * The NVE forwards a recommendation to the MoPE. * MoPE then prepares the case for the Government. * The Government presents the application to the King in Council. In Norway, the King must sign all the Government's decisions before they can be implemented. = Criticisms of Governance = * Using horizontal structures can create a lack of responsibility, and this can lead to a lack of co- ordination. * Governance can include too many stakeholders, which can prevent the network from functioning efficiently.Prell, C., et al. (2007) Stakeholder Analysis and Social Network Analysis in Natural Resource Management. Leeds: Sustainability Research Institute, University of Leeds, pp. 1-21 * Identifying the relevant stakeholders for participatory processes is complex, as certain stakeholder groups may have been excluded from previous decisions. * There is no definitive concept, or precise usage, of 'governance'; consequently this makes it difficult to create a structure to the network, as there is no easily identifiable framework to follow.Hurst, P.

In a career that lasted from 1874 to 1877 he ran eight times and won three races. In 1877 he won The Derby and the St Leger. At the end of the 1877 season he was retired to stud where he had success both in England and France. Background Silvio was bred by his owner Evelyn Boscawen, 6th Viscount Falmouth at his stud at Mereworth Castle in Kent. He was sent into training with Mathew Dawson at his Heath House stables at Newmarket, Suffolk. His sire, Blair Athol, was an outstanding racehorse who won the Derby and the St Leger in 1864 and went on to be Champion Sire on four occasions. Silvio‚Äôs dam, Silverhair, was a successful racehorse and produced other winners including the colt Garterly Bell, who finished fourth in the 1875 Derby, and the filly Silver Ring, who won six races including the Bretby Stakes. Racing career 1876: two-year-old season As a two-year-old in 1876, Silvio showed promising form to win four of his five races. On his racecourse debut, Silvio won the Ham Stakes at Goodwood. He then won three races at Newmarket: the Clearwell Stakes on 2 October, the Post Stakes, and the Glasgow Stakes in which he was the only starter and walked over. He then finished second to the French colt Verneuil in the Buckenham Stakes. 1877: three-year-old season Silvio began the season being regarded as the second string of Lord Falmouth's horses behind the filly, Lady Golightly, and was offered at odds of 33/1 for the Derby in late March. On his seasonal debut he was strongly fancied for the Newmarket Biennial Stakes in mid-April, but finished unplaced behind Grey Friar. The race was run in a violent storm, leading some observers to suggest that the form was not very reliable. On 3 May he showed much improved form in the 2000 Guineas in which he started at odds of 100/6 (16/1). Ridden by the Champion Jockey Fred Archer he finished third, beaten just over a length behind the French-bred favourite Chamant and the American Brown Prince. On 30 May at Epsom, Silvio started at odds of 100/9 (11/1) against sixteen opponents in the Derby. Ridden again by Archer, he was settled in the middle of the field in the early stages and turned into the straight just behind the leaders. Silvio moved into second place two furlongs from the finish and passed Glen Arthur to take the lead a hundred yards from the line. He won \\"cleverly\\" by half a length from Glen Arthur, with Rob Roy, who may have been unlucky in running, three quarters of a length further back in third In mid-June, Silvio beat Glen Arthur much more decisively in the Ascot Derby, the race now called the King Edward VII Stakes, despite carrying a weight penalty for his Derby win. On 12 September at Doncaster, Silvio started 13/8 favourite in a field of fourteen for the St Leger. He took the lead early in the straight and won very easily by three lengths from his stable companion Lady Golightly, with another filly, Manoeuvre in third. On his final start of the year he was no match for Springfield in Champion Stakes over ten furlongs. Silvio's earnings of ¬£12,150 made him the biggest money winner of the season in Britain. 1878: four-year-old season On his four-year-old debut Silvio ran in the Biennial Stakes at Newmarket in April and won easily by three lengths from Rifle. On the 2000 Guineas card two weeks later he won the Newmarket Prince of Wales's Stakes in which he gave ten pounds to his only rival Thunderstone and won very easily. In the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot in June he was never able to get on level terms with Verneuil and finished second, beaten six lengths, ahead of the Grand Prix de Paris winner St Christophe and Hampton. Speculation concerning a match race between Silvio and the 1876 Derby winner Kisber at York came to nothing. At Newmarket in October Silvio ran against his stable companion Jannette, the 1878 St Leger winner, in the Champion Stakes. He led from the start but was caught by the filly, to whom he was attempting to concede fifteen pounds, inside the final furlong and was beaten by a neck. He finished well ahead of Verneuil, Glen Arthur and Petrarch. On his last start of the season he recorded his most important win in over a year when he won the Jockey Club Cup very easily from Insulaire. 1879: five-year-old season Silvio stayed in training as a five-year-old but failed to win. In June he ran twice at Royal Ascot firstly in the Gold Vase on the opening day for which he started odds-on favourite but was beaten half a length by Isonomy, who was receiving seven pounds. Isonomy went on to be the most successful horse of the season in England. Two days later he started odds-on again in the Hardwicke Stakes, avoiding a rematch with Isonomy in the Gold Cup. He took the lead in the straight and looked certain to win, but was caught in the last strides by the three-year-old Chippendale, and beaten by a head. Silvio was attempting to concede twenty-four pounds to the winner. At the July meeting at Newmarket, Silvio was beaten a head by the four-year-old Phoenix after a \\"magnificent race\\" for the Bunbury Stakes. Stud career Silvio began his stud career in England and had little impact. He was sold for ¬£7,000 to the Duc de Castries and exported to France after two seasons and was more successful becoming leading French sire in 1886. His winners in France included May Pole (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches), Jupin (Prix Lupin) and Viennois (Prix d'Ispahan) In April 1890 he sustained a fetlock injury which became infected, and, despite veterinary treatment, Silvio had to be euthanized soon afterwards.

Still Life: Flowers in a Vase (1909‚Äì1913), oil on canvas, 520 x 420 mm, Sanlam Art Collection After attending the farm school Rocklands, she left for boarding school at Bloemhof Seminary, Stellenbosch, where she was introduced to the art of drawing. She returned to the farm in 1901, and during a visit to Cape Town she met Beatrice Hazel, a realistic romantic style painter, who introduced her to Edward Roworth, giving impetus to her desire to study painting. In 1903 she convinced her parents to let her go to Cape Town once a week for singing lessons. The difficulty of travel and the low opinion her mother had of her mezzo-soprano voice discouraged her, but it was at this stage that she started painting on her own. She studied painting under Roworth in Cape Town for two months of 1903, during which time she received a silver medal for her work. By 1907 she had become proficient enough to be elected to the South African Society of Artists (SASA) and, in 1909, she was represented at the annual exhibition of the SASA and the Fine Arts Association of Cape Town. By 1910, she had her own studio in Strand Street, Cape Town. During a 1912 visit to her nephew, Gert Coetzee, in Pretoria, she took up employment as a governess on a farm owned by the Wolmarans family in Ermelo district, Transvaal, where she also taught art and needlework. While on vacation in Durban with a friend, Sophie Fisher, she befriended Jan Hendrik Arnold Balw√© (Consul for the Netherlands in Durban 1903‚Äì1913), a shipping-line owner who offered to finance her and her sister Hannah's studies abroad. Holland and England Laubser and her sister left for Europe on 4 October 1913, initially living in an artists' colony at Laren, Noord-Holland in an area called het Gooi. She met Ita Mees, a concert pianist and Frederik van Eeden, author and poet. She also befriended Laura Knight and Frans Langeveld, both painters. In the last years of his life, Anton Mauve (1838 ‚Äì 1888), who was an important influence on Vincent van Gogh, lived in Laren. Laubser worked in the studio he established there. At the outbreak of World War I she went to London. She initially stayed in Huntingdonshire and then, in October 1914, moved to a London hotel and registered at the Slade School of Art for the period October 1914 to March 1919. Henry Tonks, Walter Westley Russell and Ambrose McEvoy taught her drawing, while Philip Wilson Steer lectured her in painting. It seems that she never painted during her time at the Slade, instead concentrating her efforts on drawing of portraiture and figure studies. Laubser returned to South Africa briefly in 1915 to visit the new family farm at Oortmanspost, near Klipheuwel in the Cape Province and again in March 1919, after her studies were concluded. Early career and travels Belgium, June 1919 to September 1920 Laubser left London on 6 June 1919 for Belgium, staying at Antwerp and the Villa Chenes in the Nachtigalen Lei in Schoten. She befriended Arnold Balw√©, son of her patron, who studied at the Academy. She might have accompanied Balw√© as an occasional student, as is evidenced by a number of nude studies sketched during this period. There is also some evidence that she came into contact with the art of Die Br√ºcke and Der Blaue Reiter during a stay in Munich in 1919. Italy, October 1920 to August 1921 Pink Blossoming Tree, (1920‚Äì1921), oil on cardboard, 340 x 400 mm, Sanlam Art Collection Laubser travelled with Balw√© to Italy in August/September 1920 and lived and worked at Torri del Benaco and San Vigilio on the Garda Lake. During this time the couple was supported financially by Balw√©'s father and this gave them freedom to work on paintings for possible exhibitions instead of sale. A large number of signed and dated works from this period give some support to this. J. H. A. Balw√© had been ill towards the end of 1920, and Arnold Balw√© and Laubser accompanied him to Bad Kissingen in mid-April 1921, where he died in April or May of that year. After Balw√©'s death Laubser travelled to Venice, where she visited the Doge's Palace (June/July 1921), then to Milan and, on 18 August 1921, back to Germany. On 19 September 1921 she arrived in Cape Town on the Union-Castle Line. Germany, November 1922 to November 1924 Portrait of a Man, Berlin, (circa 1923), oil on board, 595 x 475 mm Laubser was issued with a visa by the German Consulate in Cape Town on 16 November 1922 and was installed at Kurf√ºrstendamm 40, Berlin by 1 January 1923. Her address had apparently changed to Kurf√ºrstendamm 43, Berlin by 23 January 1923. She looked up Irma Stern and they undertook a trip to the Baltic Sea at Ahrenshoop for three weeks in July 1923. After trips to Weimar and Bavaria and another change of address from Kalckreuthstrasse 5 to lodgings with a Fr√§ulein Finck at Von der Heydt Strasse 1, south of the Tiergarten, which she obtained with the help of her friend Kate M√§dler, she settled down to the cultural life of Berlin. She met members of the diplomatic corps, painted portraits and attended music concerts. She befriended pianists William Busch, p. 146 and Otto Glore. It was in Berlin, from 1922 to 1924, that she came into contact with German Expressionism and was encouraged by Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. The works of Emil Nolde, Max Pechstein, Franz Marc and Erich Waske were available to her and clarified her ambitions. She singled out Franz Marc of Der Blaue Reiter and Nolde, Schmidt-Rottluff and Pechstein of Die Br√ºcke as significant to her personality, although she would claim not to have been influenced by them. The extent of their influence is evident in that she came closest to the German Expressionist style during these years, in which she produced a series of ten lithographs called Visionen. On 14 August 1924 she made arrangements with Allison Bros., London to ship her paintings to South Africa. South African debut and critical reception Bloublommetjieskloof, oil on canvas laid-down on board, 270 x 365 mm In November 1924, Laubser returned to South Africa and settled at Oortmanspost, the family farm. She met sculptor Moses Kottler and the cartoonist D. C. Boonzaier, who introduced her to his son Gregoire, founding member of the New Group, and renewed her friendship with painters Ruth Prowse and Nita Spilhaus. She was asked to exhibit in Cape Town, and was cruelly disillusioned. Her work, like that of Irma Stern, met with fierce criticism, most notably from Bernard Lewis of Die Burger and The Cape Times, who as late as 1931 was able to write of her work in a group show: In April 1929 she met P. Serton and his wife, as well as A. C. Celliers and Koos Botha, all of whom encouraged her to have a one-man exhibition. Her first solo exhibition was held in Stellenbosch, with support from A. C. Bouman and Con de Villiers. During this time she also met Martin du Toit, who would become a fervent supporter, organising her first exhibition in the Transvaal in 1931. Empire Exhibition, Johannesburg, 1936 On 3 May 1936, Laubser's father died, leaving the farm to her brother, and establishing a trust fund for her mother. Laubser would inherit the balance of the trust fund when her mother died on 20 November 1936. Although she was treated harshly by the press, Laubser was elected to the selection panel of the prestigious British Empire Exhibition, the convener of which was M. L. du Toit, without her parents living to see this success. The Empire Exhibition was a quadrennial exposition, which in 1936 was held in Milner Park, Johannesburg, and it was representative of the best South Africa had to offer. It was here that Laubser became familiar with Alexis Preller, who would attract the ire of the critics for his work at the first New Group exhibition on 4 May 1938. Laubser would also be a member of the New Group, and present at the exhibition of 1938. Later years and legacy Annie of the Royal Bafokeng, 1945, oil on canvasboard Laubser with Annie of the Royal Bafokeng in 1945 Laubser was active from as early as 1900 and continued working uninterrupted until her death in 1973. The catalogue raisonn√© compiled by Dalene Marais contains 1784 individual works. Her predominant style of work is generally accepted by many authors to be Expressionist, but there are also identifiable elements of Fauvism at work, and a pastoralism that belie the German Expressionist prototypes to which Laubser was exposed. After the death of her parents she settled in Cape Town in 1937, taking a studio in Three Anchor Bay. In 1942, she moved to the Strand. She built a cottage there, called Altyd Lig (Always Bright), in 1947. On 28 May 1946 Prof. P. J. Nienaber announced that Laubser would receive the honorary medal of the Academy of Arts and Science. In 1945 she painted Annie of the Royal Bafokeng.https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/18788/lot/208 In 1947 she received the Oscar Award for painting from Die Vaderland, a newspaper. In 1948, membership of the South African Academy for Arts and Science was awarded to her and the poet Elisabeth Eybers.Die Burger, 2 September 1948, p. 12 She continued painting and continued to evolve her style, and in 1959 she was presented with an honorary membership of the Academy of Art and Science. The South African Association of Arts honoured her with a medal in 1968, presented by Prof. A. L. Meiring. The South African National Gallery and the Pretoria Art Museum combined to host a major retrospective exhibition of Laubser's works in 1969. This was followed in 1987 by a retrospective of early works, again at the South African National Gallery, which ran from 2 December 1987 to 31 January 1988. Maggie Laubser died on 17 May 1973 at Altyd Lig. There was an unfinished canvas on her easel.

His parents belonged to a local cultural elite visited by writers such as Maria Konopnicka and Konrad Pr√≥szy≈Ñski. The estate was nationalized after World War II, but the actual manor remained his until the end of his life. Szaniawski went to school in Warsaw and studied agriculture in Lausanne, France, before returning there. He debuted in 1912 with a series of short novellas published in Kurier Warszawski and in a satirical weekly Sowizdrza≈Ç. The stories were soon collected in his volume ≈Ågarze pod Z≈ÇotƒÖ KotwicƒÖ (Liars under a Gold Anchor, 1928).

Since then, his plays were performed regularly by many Polish theatres. In the 1920s Szaniawski wrote a whole series of stage plays, notably: Papierowy kochanek (Paper-made Lover, 1920), Ewa (1921), Lekkoduch (Trifler, 1923) performed by Reduta; as well as Ptak (Bird, 1923), ≈ªeglarz (Sailor, 1925), and Adwokat i r√≥≈ºe (Attorney and roses, 1929) which won the national literary prize a year later.

Later years and controversy surrounding his death After the war, Szaniawski resided in Krak√≥w for a time, where he wrote his famous play Dwa teatry (Two Theatres) in 1946. It premiered there at the Teatr ≈ªo≈Çnierza Polskiego, with set-design by Tadeusz Kantor. Until the end of Stalinism in Poland, it was his most frequently performed play.

The construction architecture is Burr truss consisting of multiple king-posts with panel posts generally spaced 10 feet apart. A number of reasons have been offered to explain the construction of covered bridges in Kentucky during the 19th century. The protection the cover provided against wood deterioration was likely most important. The yellow poplar used in the construction was thought - at the time - to be almost indestructible when shielded from the weather. The cover allowed timbered trusses and braces to season properly and kept water out of the joints, prolonging the life by seven to eight times that of an uncovered bridge. A second plausible reason is that the boarded sides and shingled roofs prevented horses from seeing the drop to the water below and becoming \\"spooked\\". \\" References Buildings and structures in Bourbon County, Kentucky Covered bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Kentucky Wooden bridges in Kentucky Covered bridges in Kentucky Road bridges in Kentucky National Register of Historic Places in Bourbon County, Kentucky Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Kentucky Burr Truss bridges in the United States Bridges completed in 1877 ","title":"Colville Covered Bridge"},{"id":"34126943","text":"Roderick Ainsworth was a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly.

Located at 176 Peachtree Street in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, United States, the Winecoff Hotel was advertised as \\"absolutely fireproof\\". While the hotel's steel structure was indeed protected against the effects of fire, the hotel's interior finishes were combustible, and the building's exit arrangements consisted of a single stairway serving all fifteen floors. All of the hotel's occupants above the fire's origin on the third floor were trapped, and the fire's survivors either were rescued from upper-story windows or jumped into nets held by firemen. The fire was notable for the number of victims who jumped to their deaths. A photograph of one survivor's fall won the 1947 Pulitzer Prize for Photography. The fire ‚Äì which followed the June 5, 1946, La Salle Hotel fire in Chicago (with 61 fatalities), and the June 19, 1946, Canfield Hotel fire in Dubuque, Iowa (with 19 fatalities) ‚Äì spurred significant changes in North American building codes, most significantly requiring multiple protected means of egress and self-closing fire-resistive doors for guest rooms in hotels. Winecoff Hotel The Winecoff Hotel (now the Ellis Hotel) opened in 1913 as one of the tallest buildings in Atlanta. The steel-framed structure was built on a small lot measuring by , bounded by Peachtree Street, Ellis Street and an alley, with per floor. Guest rooms extended from the third to the fifteenth floors, with fifteen rooms on a typical floor. Corridors on guest floors were arranged in an H-shape, with two elevators and the upward flights of stairs opening into the cross halls, and opposing downward runs of stairs converging on a single landing from the legs of the H. The single stairway, of non-combustible construction, was not enclosed with fire-resistant doors. While the use of multiple stairways was becoming common practice in tall buildings, the Atlanta Building Code of 1911 permitted buildings on lots of less than to have a single stairway. The steel structure was protected by structural clay tile and concrete fireproofing. The hotel was touted in advertisements and on its stationery as \\"absolutely fireproof\\". Interior partitions, including the walls between corridors and guest rooms were hollow clay tile covered with plaster. Room doors were wood, with movable transom panels above each door for ventilation between the rooms and the corridors, closed by a wood panel of less than in thickness. The corridor walls were finished with painted burlap fabric extending up to wainscot height. Guest rooms were finished with as many as seven layers of wallpaper. The hotel had a central fire alarm system, manually operated from the front desk, and a standpipe with hose racks at each floor. There was no automatic sprinkler system. The Winecoff was within two blocks of two Atlanta Fire Rescue Department engine and two ladder companies, one of which was within thirty seconds of the hotel. Fire The rear of the Winecoff Hotel with the fire escape stairway added during reconstruction after the fire The fire's point of origin was on the third floor west hallway, where a mattress and chair had been temporarily placed in the corridor, close to the stairway to the fourth floor. One theory suggests that a dropped cigarette may have ignited the mattress or other combustibles in the corridor. The fire was first noticed about 3:15 a.m. by a bellboy who had gone to the fifth floor to help a guest and was trapped. However, the first (and only) call to the fire department was made at 3:42 a.m. by the night manager, who was reported to have attempted to warn guests by telephone of the fire. The building fire alarm was not sounded, although by that time no escape was possible from the upper floors in any case. A survivor recounted being awakened and made aware of the fire by the sound of people screaming. The first engine and ladder companies arrived within thirty seconds of the call. By that time people were already jumping from windows. Fire department ladders could extend only part way up the building, but many guests were rescued in this manner. Other people were rescued via ladders placed horizontally across the alley to an adjoining building. Mortgage Guaranty Building Fire spread was initially hampered by the stair arrangement. While the stairs were not closed off by doors, the configuration placed ascending and descending runs around the corner from each other, keeping fire and hot gas from quickly ascending the stair. Fire did not spread through the enclosed elevator shafts, nor through the laundry or mail chutes. Open transoms between the rooms and the corridors admitted fresh air for combustion, eventually creating a flue-like effect with the fire climbing to all but the two top floors. Once established in the corridors, the fire fed on the burlap wallcoverings and ignited room doors and transoms. Doors and transoms were burned through on all but the fourteenth and fifteenth floors. Guests opened windows seeking fresh air and rescue, further enabling the draft of fresh air to the fire. The fire investigation revealed that an open transom was closely associated with the ignition of a given guest room and its contents.  Firefighters  Firefighters were hampered, and in some cases injured, by falling bodies. A number of guests tied bedsheets together and tried to descend. Others misjudged the ten-foot-wide alley between the rear of the Winecoff and the Mortgage Guaranty Building and attempted to jump across. The Atlanta Fire Department mustered 385 firefighters, 22 engine companies and 11 ladder trucks, four of which were aerial ladder units, at the scene. A second alarm was sounded at 3:44 a.m. and a third at 3:49 a.m., with a general alarm (all available units respond, including off-duty personnel) at 4:02 a.m. Mutual aid from surrounding departments brought a total of 49 pieces of equipment. Firefighters climbed adjoining buildings to fight the fire and rescue guests, including the 12-story Mortgage Guaranty building across the wide alley, and the six-story Davison-Paxon department store (later Macy's) on the opposite side of Ellis Street. Casualties Of the 304 guests in the hotel that night, 119 died, about 65 were injured and about 120 were rescued uninjured. The hotel's original owners, the Winecoffs, who lived in an apartment in the hotel, died in the apartment. Thirty-two deaths were among those who jumped, or who fell while trying to descend ropes made of sheets tied together to reach the ground or too short fire ladders. Among the hotel guests were forty high school students on a State YMCA of Georgia (\\"Y\\" Clubs) sponsored trip to Atlanta for a state youth-in-government legislative program, thirty of whom died. The students had mostly been placed two to a room at the back of the hotel next to the alley, where many of the windows had been covered by louvered shutters for privacy. The occupants of the shuttered rooms were killed on every floor above the fifth floor. Between $3 million and $4 million in claims were brought against the hotel's owners, but insurance awards totaled only about $350,000. Among the casualties were: * William Fleming Winecoff (age 76), the hotel's builder and namesake. He lived with his wife for 31 years in suite 1011‚Äì1012. He was found dead in a nearby hall. * Grace Smith Winecoff (age 76), the builder's wife. She died on the sidewalk of Peachtree Street. * Patricia Ann Griffin (age 14), daughter of Marvin Griffin and one of 40 delegates of the second Youth Assembly at the Georgia State Capitol who were staying at the Winecoff. She suffocated with another delegate and their chaperone in room 926. * Christine Adams Hinson (age 17), daughter of Isham Lamar Hinson, Sr. and one of the 40 delegates of the second Youth Assembly at the Georgia State Capitol who were staying at the Winecoff. She was staying in room 1430. * Ernest Benedict Weatherly (age 63), former chairman of a federally appointed committee on the beef industry. He jumped to his death from room 1024. * Margaret Wilson Nichols (age 30). A onetime Miss Atlanta runner-up and a well-known former box-office girl at the Fox and Paramount in Atlanta, Georgia, she died falling from room 720 to the alley behind the hotel. * Elmer Andrew Conzett (age 32), Navy Lieutenant Commander, bomber pilot in World War II * Ashley John Burns (age 26), grandson of William J. Burns. He suffocated in room 1416. * Borgia McCoy (age 58), mother-in-law of British vice-consul Thomas Bolton. In town to help with her grandchild, she suffocated in room 724. * Florance Allen Baggett (age 43), a well-known auctioneer. He was staying in suite 1108-1110-1112 with his first cousins Sarah Baggett Miller (died) and Catherine Baggett McLaughlin (survived). Catherine made it down safely, Sarah fell, and Florance suffocated in the room. * Nell Zorn Sims (age 33), president of the Business and Professional Women's Club of Barnesville, Georgia. She climbed out of room 1504, slipped from the cornice and fell 15 stories, landing on the hood of a fire truck and breaking her neck. One of the fire's victims, Daisy McCumber, falls after jumping from a window. She survived, with serious injuries. This photograph by Arnold Hardy won a 1947 Pulitzer Prize. Press coverage Arnold Hardy, a 24-year-old Georgia Tech graduate student, won the 1947 Pulitzer Prize for Photography, capturing the fall of Daisy McCumber from the building with his last flashbulb. Hardy had been coming home from a dance. Hearing sirens, he called the fire department to find the location and went to the fire scene. Atlanta Journal photographer Jack Young, suffering from pleurisy, checked into Grady Memorial Hospital at 3:30 AM on December 7. When the hospital received news of the mass-casualty incident, Young dressed and left the hospital for the fire scene. AP photographers Rudy Faircloth and Horace Cort also arrived at the scene. Following the fire, Hardy appeared at the AP office with his own images, three of which were usable, one of which was of McCumber's fall. The AP bought Hardy's pictures for $300. McCumber survived her fall. Impact on fire codes The fire, coming on the heels of the La Salle Hotel fire, had a major impact on building codes. A national conference on fire prevention was convened in 1947 at the direction of U.S. President Harry S. Truman in response to the La Salle and Winecoff fires. Both fires had highlighted the problems associated with unprotected stair openings, which provided paths for the spread of smoke (in the case of the La Salle Hotel) and fire (at the Winecoff), simultaneously preventing the use of the stairs for escape. The National Fire Protection Association's Building Exits Code of 1927 had already set forth principles requiring the use of multiple, protected means of egress, and was further revised to allow the code to be incorporated as law. Emphasis in building design and construction was changed from the protection of property ‚Äî the Winecoff's \\"completely fireproof\\" statement on its stationery was accurate insofar as it was confined to the building's structure ‚Äî to place primary emphasis on the protection of life, with property protection subordinated to that goal. Georgia Governor Ellis Arnall reacted to the narrowly defined \\"fireproof\\" statement, stating: Fireproof construction was a term primarily originating with the insurance industry, which was chiefly concerned with property loss claims. A \\"fireproof building\\" could withstand a severe fire and be returned to service once its interior finishes were replaced, without total loss due to collapse or damage to adjoining structures. The Building Exits Code was significantly revised in 1948 to address issues of finish combustibility, detection and warning, and provisions related to the number of people in the building. To highlight its principal emphasis, the Building Exits Code was retitled the Code for Safety to Life from Fire in 1966, which was further developed and re-titled as the Life Safety Code. The Winecoff fire led to the incorporation of wartime research into the flammability of building materials into code requirements and design standards, recognizing the existence of flashover as a means of fire propagation. The Winecoff was cited as a notable example in which multiple flashovers served to propagate the fire at each successive level.Maines, pp. 114‚Äì115, quoting from the 1948 NFPA Handbook of Fire Protection The La Salle and Winecoff fires, in which combustible finish materials were prominent hazards, spurred the adoption of the Steiner tunnel test which had been used by Underwriters Laboratories to establish the relative fire hazard of materials as the ASTM-E84 and NFPA-255 standards from 1958. The prohibition of operable transoms in guest rooms was a direct result of the Winecoff fire. The Winecoff fire also stimulated debate concerning the ex post facto enforcement of new fire code requirements in older properties. Until the rash of hotel fires in 1946, such legislation was regarded as an unconstitutional taking of property. Newer legislation enabled the enforcement of standards for existing buildings in addition to new construction.  Memorials  Georgia Historical Marker for the Winecoff Fire Family and friends of victims and survivors gathered in Sandy Springs for the 70th anniversary of the fire and remember the victims. South of the hotel, stands a historical marker that commemorates the victims, survivors and the fire.

A grand muftiate is more significant than a muftiate, and is presided over by a grand mufti. A grand muftiate or muftiate is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the directorate, and oversees the local boards, clerics, mosques, and trusteeships. The structure of Russian- and south-eastern European muftiates were never prescribed by Islamic doctrine, but instead are based on the principle of an all-encompassing legal and administrative order in parallel fashion to Christian dioceses with the purpose of regulating the Islamic religion. History In 1788 the Russian Empire under Empress Catherine II established the first muftiate in Russia named ‚ÄúThe Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly‚Äù governed by a supreme mufti who oversaw the appointment of imams and the management of mosques across the empire. The mufti was initially appointed by the emperor, but with a decree signed by Emperor Alexander I in 1817, it was determined that the mufti should be elected by the Muslim community with imperial approval. Most of the muftis, their assistants and ordinary mullahs were elected from the Kazan Tatars. The mufti's duties included overseeing the Muslim clergy, clerical appointments, the construction of mosques, marriages and divorces, inheritances, property disputes, endowments (waqf), cases of disobedience to parents by children, the correctness of the execution of Muslim worship, and birth registrations. With the creation of the Soviet Union the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly was replaced with the Central Spiritual Board of Muslims.Creating Enemies of the State: Religious Persecution in Uzbekistn http://www.refworld.org/cgi- bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=publisher&publisher;=HRW&type;=&coi;=UZB&docid;=41528e504&skip;=0 After 1944 the management of spiritual affairs of the Muslim population in Russia was carried out by four independent spiritual boards: The Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia and Kazakhstan (Tashkent), The Spiritual Administration of Muslims of the Caucasus (Baku), The Spiritual Administration of Muslims of the Northern Caucasus (Buynaksk), and The Spiritual Administration of Muslims of the European Part of the USSR and Siberia (Ufa).The Politicization of Islam in Postsoviet Central Asia http://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rss/31-2_097.pdf The breakup of the four spiritual boards came with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Today, each of the former Soviet Republics with significant Muslim populations have their own independent Spiritual Boards. Attempts have been made to unite all the Islamic religious organizations in Russia into one single umbrella organization without success. In the 19th century the Austrian Habsburgs and Russians expanded into southeastern Europe, carving territory out of the Ottoman Empire and helping establish newly independent countries. The Muslim population in these countries were organized under muftiates in a similar fashion to those in Russia. Today, the majority of muftiates in south-eastern Europe are independent from government control. Countries South-Eastern Europe Countries in southern-eastern Europe who inherited large Muslim populations after gaining their independence from the Ottoman Empire between the 17th and 19th centuries include: Albania, Bosnia-and-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia. Many of these muftiates were established by these countries following their independence from the Ottoman Empire. Former Soviet Union Former republics of the Soviet Union that retained muftiates or \\"spiritual boards\\" after the breakup of the USSR: Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Four spiritual directorates presided over the territory of the Soviet Union until the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. The newly independent countries established their own independent muftiates or \\"spiritual boards\\" based on the remnants of the Soviet system. Structure and organization At the top of the structure of a grand muftiate is a grand mufti and his council, followed by muftis and their councils. Independent muftiates are governed by a mufti and a council. In Russia (as was during the Soviet Union) a muftiate is further divided into qadiyats which are led by qadis. Directly subordinate to qadiyats are muhtasibats which are headed by a muhtasib (originally an Ottoman official charged with supervising proper weights and measures in markets and the proper conduct of certain rituals). In some muftiates the qadis rank below a muhtasib. Each mahalla or congregation is managed by an elected body called a mutavalliat composed of members of the congregation. The level of governance differs from country to country and even from muftiate to muftiate. In some countries muftis are elected by adherents while in others they are appointed to the post by the council of muftis or appointed by the government.http://criticaleurope.com/2013/04/the-reorganization-of-muslim- structures-in-russia-an-example-for-europe-164/ See also * List of Islamic Muftiates * Grand Mufti * Mufti * Qadiyat * Muhtasibat * Mahallah  References  Islamic legal occupations Religious leadership roles Administrative territorial entities by type ","title":"Muftiate"},{"id":"34127076","text":"\\"To the Lost\\" is the twelfth episode of the second season of HBO television series Boardwalk Empire and the season finale, which premiered on HBO December 11, 2011. The episode was written by series creator Terence Winter and directed by Tim Van Patten, both executive producers. The episode received wide critical acclaim, particularly for Michael Pitt's performance, Tim Van Patten's direction and Terence Winter's writing. Plot Jimmy attempts to make amends for betraying Nucky, despite knowing that Nucky will never forgive him. Aided by Richard, he ends the workers strike by kidnapping the Klansmen responsible for the raid on Chalky‚Äôs warehouse and delivering them to Chalky, along with compensation for the families of the men they killed. Jimmy asks Chalky to arrange a meeting with Nucky, which he expresses a desire to make things right and blames Eli for the assassination attempt. Nucky asks Jimmy to sabotage the criminal charges against him. Jimmy destroys the Commodore‚Äôs will to ensure that he will inherit his estate, and forces Neary to write a statement implicating Eli at gunpoint; Jimmy and Richard then stage Neary's death as a suicide. Mickey brokers a meeting between Nucky and Manny Horvitz, who suggests they partner up and kill Jimmy. Nucky, concerned that Margaret Schroeder will testify against him, proposes to her and admits that he is asking her to save his life. When she sees Nucky caring for Emily, who is still recovering from polio, Margaret agrees to marry him prior to the trial. The judge grants a mistrial given Neary's death and the recanting of other witness statements. Meanwhile, Congress announces its intention to supply the road appropriations funding Nucky needs to profit from his investment in a tract of land between Atlantic City and Philadelphia, which he plans to use for a lucrative construction deal. He asks Margaret to sign the land back over to him now that the threat of asset forfeiture has been lifted. Jimmy spends a day taking his son to the beach and drinking with Richard while recounting war stories. Nucky approaches Eli and convinces him to plead guilty with the promise of minimal prison time. Eli lies to Nucky, claiming that he was not involved in planning the assassination attempt. Elsewhere, Luciano approaches Rothstein regarding heroin distribution. Nucky calls during the meeting to ask Rothstein for permission to kill Manny, but says that he is uncertain that he will do so. Nucky calls Jimmy and arranges to meet him at the Atlantic City War Memorial, claiming to have captured Manny. Jimmy insists on going alone and unarmed to the meeting, correctly predicting that Nucky plans to kill him. He accepts his fate, stating he really died in the trenches, and tries to talk Nucky through the process. Nucky shoots him in the face, but initially fails to kill him outright. Standing over a mortally wounded Jimmy, Nucky coldly proclaims, \\"I am not seeking forgiveness.\\" He then fires once more, killing Jimmy. As he dies, Jimmy flashes back to going over the top of a trench during the war. The following morning, Nucky lies to Margaret about his whereabouts, and his involvement in the murder, claiming that Jimmy had re-enlisted in the army. He then drives out to meet his fellow land buyers to celebrate their new fortune, while Margaret, without Nucky's knowledge, donates the land to her parish. Production When series creator Terence Winter and the other Boardwalk Empire writers were plotting the second season's storyline, they decided to have Nucky cross the line. \\"Once we started plotting the season out, when we were honest with ourselves, we said, if the idea was to bring Nucky from (Jimmy telling him) 'You can't be half a gangster anymore' to the point where he crosses the line and is engaging in gangster behavior himself,\\" he said. They wrestled with the idea of killing off Pitt's character. \\"Once we started to come to that conclusion, there was a good number of months where we really wrestled with it, asking, 'Is there any way? Can he kill someone else? Let Jimmy off the hook?' And the honest answer kept coming back to 'No, this is it,'\\" he added. The storyline worked out for the writers in the end as, Winter stated, \\"Just given the fact that episodic TV being what it is, the audience is so in tune to the rhythm of things: Okay, well, they'll never kill a main character. If this happens, it'll happen in season five.\\" He spoke of the incest scene in the previous episode, \\"It came to us as season 1 was developing. Searching back in my memory of how even Gillian developed, I knew I wanted his mother to be a showgirl, so if she's a showgirl, she can't be 50 years old, she's gotta be younger. So she's a young woman, so she had him as a kid. Why don't we push that as far as we can go, she had him when she was 13 years old. And if she was a child herself, they would have a very odd relationship; he probably grew up in dance halls, and around a lot of naked showgirls, seen his mother naked a million times. This has just been a strange childhood for this guy.\\" On Margaret's storyline, Winter spoke of Margaret's feeling of being \\"duped\\" by Nucky and his ongoing lies: \\"It's not just Jimmy. I think she felt completely duped. As soon as Nucky came home and said Jim Neary had committed suicide, she's been down this road before. I think she made her decision at this point, that this guy will never change. The whole sappy story about God and the family ‚Äî it's not that she doesn't believe he loves her and the kids, because he does, but in terms of him learning any kind of lesson or changing in any way, I think she knows things are pretty much the same, if not worse.\\" He continued, \\"The Jimmy thing at the end just caps it for her, she knows he's absolutely lying and that Jimmy didn't rejoin the Army. In giving away that land, signing the deed over, it's that all debts are paid to God.\\" Winter also teased that Van Alden would return in Cicero, where Al Capone rose to power.

An example of his \\"no holds barred\\" writing comes from the Introduction to Modern Art; the Men, the Movements, the Meaning: However, despite the fact that he could be caustic, he was equally capable of providing praise. In describing John Steuart Curry's painting Baptism in Kansas, he says, \\"There was no burlesque in the picture, no satire, no sophisticated fooling. It was conceived in reverence and spiritual understanding, and executed with an honesty of purpose that is all too rare in any art.\\"Catalog of a Loan Exhibition of Drawings and Paintings by John Steuart Curry, Lakeside Press, 1939, page 5.

His works date to the middle of the 13th century and are counted among the most important artworks of the European Middle Ages. The Naumburg Master very likely learned his craft in northern France in the heyday of the High Gothic style. He was active in the towns of Noyon, Amiens, and Reims around 1225, and later possibly came to Metz in the Holy Roman Empire. Around 1230 he worked on Mainz Cathedral, where he created the fragmentary rood screen, including a sandstone relief of Saint Martin that became known as the Bassenheim Horseman. Afterwards he traveled east along the Via Regia to the episcopal see of Naumburg, where the rebuilding of Naumburg Cathedral had started around 1210 and the Gothic west choir was added from about 1245-1250. Construction was likely finished by 1257, including the twelve monumental donor portraits that are considered his masterpieces, and it is from thence that his notname derives. Made of Grillenburg Sandstone, some of the sculptures are identified by name while others could not be assigned with certainty. The portraits of the main benefactors Margrave Eckard II of Meissen and his consort Uta von Ballenstedt as well as Margrave Herman I and his spouse Regelinda stand on both sides of the choir entrance. Considering his characteristic style, the Naumburg Master is also identified as the creator of the founder figures in Meissen Cathedral and of the tomb slab of one knight Hermann von Hagen, the relative of a Naumburg canon, in Merseburg Cathedral. His art shaped the work of numerous masons all over Central Germany. He was thus a decisive conveyor and pioneer of the ground-breaking innovations in architecture and sculpture of the late Hohenstaufen period in the 13th century.

History  The old earthen ramp in the 1970s. Until 2004 an earthen ramp allowed non-Muslim visitors direct access to the Temple Mount through the Mughrabi Gate. An 800-year-old wall holding back part of the hill jutting out from the Western Wall leading up to the Mughrabi Gate partially collapsed. Authorities believed a recent earthquake may have been responsible. During the winter of that year heavy snowfall (by Israeli standards) caused the ramp to collapse. In 2007, the current wooden bridge was built, originally intended as a temporary measure that would stand for several months until a more permanent bridge was constructed. In order to build a permanent bridge, the remains of the old ramp and the dirt under it had to be excavated, which resulted in accusations by the Waqf that Israel was trying to destabilise the Temple Mount and collapse the Dome of the Rock from the location of the rampwhich in turn resulted in international criticism, violent protests and calls for a third Intifada. Several of the neighbouring Arab states argued that the work threatened their internal stability, while other states threatened war. As a result, the bridge was still standing at the end of 2011, when the city engineer of Jerusalem issued an order to close the structure because it was not safe. In 2012 and 2013, the support scaffolding of the bridge was replaced with a large metal beam structure and the area under the bridge was again open for visitors to walk around, resulting in a 1.5‚Äì2x increase in size of the Western Wall's women's prayer area (but not greater than the original area prior to construction). 2014 addition In August 2014, construction was started on a second bridge to the Mughrabi Gate. The second bridge would be a supplement to the 2007 Mughrabi Bridge. This secondary bridge became controversial, and at the wishes of the Jordanian government, work was halted and what had been built was torn down.  Significance  The Mughrabi gate is the only gate to the Temple Mount that the Waqf allows non-Muslims to use for visiting the Temple Mount complex. The bridge is the only way to reach the gate. The bridge and excavation of the historic ramp leading up to the gate, have been a point of contention contributing to the hostility of the Arab- Israeli conflict.

It is located between the north-west corner of the market square, and Castlegate, on the B1257 road north of Helmsley Castle. Dedicated to All Saints, it has been part of the Church of England since the Reformation. It is one of four churches in the same benefice: Sproxton, Rievaulx, and East Moors. The church was granted Grade II* listed building status on 4 January 1955. History There has been a church in Helmsley since before the Norman conquest, and the churchyard was used as a market place in Anglo-Saxon times. Another measure of the church's antiquity is the hogback gravestone in the porch. A church was recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086. An organ by Mr. Whitehead of York was installed in 1852-53. The opening service was on 27 January 1853 when the choir of York Minster were in attendance. There was much rebuilding in the 19th century, between 1866 and 1869 funded by the Earl of Feversham by the architects Banks and Barry and the contractors Barton and Smith of Helmsley, at a cost of ¬£16,000 (). Many changes were made in the rebuilding, and Norman and later features were lost, including the font, which was replaced in 1868; the original medieval font is now in the church at Pockley. However, the church gained some fine stained glass by Hardman & Co. of Birmingham. In 1931 a Harrison and Harrison pipe organ was installed on a platform immediately west of the chancel. This organ replaced an existing instrument installed in 1868 by the Walker organ company. Mr Arthur Harrison retained some of the existing pipework and incorporated this in the new instrument. Architecture In the 12th century the church was built in the Norman style and two arches, one over the entrance doorway, the other over the chancel, remain in place. They are rounded arches in the Norman style, as opposed to the Early English in which pointed arches were used in later developments. The church has a three-stage west tower, a four- bay nave, a two-bay chancel, transepts, vestry and south porch. Its 19th- century restoration was in the Gothic Revival style but incorporates work from the old church. It is constructed of sandstone ashlar with a steeply sloping stone slate roof. The tower has 13th-century lancet windows to its west and north faces at the second stage. Its other lancet windows, round-headed belfry windows and octagonal turrets date from the 19th-century restoration. The south porch is entered by a round arch accessing a 12th-century doorway. Windows installed in the 19th century in the north aisle and at the west end have reticulated tracery. The chancel has round-headed and lancet windows. Photographs reveal that the roof was altered in the restoration of 1866‚Äì69 and the church had a parapet with battlements on the southern side. The north chapel is dedicated to Aelred, third abbot of the Cistercian monastery at Rievaulx Abbey. It contains a statue of the Virgin Mary, and votive candles. The south chapel is dedicated to Columba, a missionary from Ireland who brought Christianity to much of northern England. The chapel contains wall paintings of contemporary events, including depictions of Saint Oswald and a knight slaying a dragon emblazoned with the pagan gods. Modern usage There is a congregation of around 70 people, and services use the Harrison and Harrison pipe organ, which is above and behind the pulpit.

He was stabbed to death during the uprising in Sobib√≥r by inmates. Beckmann was a member of the NSDAP (member 305,721) and the SS. Nothing is known about his early life. SS career Beckmann worked initially in the cremation process at the Nazi Action T4 killing centers of Grafeneck Castle and Hadamar Euthanasia Centre, where the disabled were gassed. For Aktion Reinhard, he was transferred to the Sobib√≥r extermination camp, where he was mainly in Camp II as head of the sorting commands, where the clothing was sorted, and was responsible for tending to horses. Sorting command After the Jews had arrived on the ramp, they were forced to strip naked and put all of their clothes and luggage to the side. Those who could not walk were taken away in carts.Schelvis: Vernichtungslager Sobib√≥r. p. 84 If this was happening too slowly, their clothes were torn from their body by force. Then the order came to go into the bath house (gas chamber). Prior to that, they had to pass a counter, at which was SS Oberscharf√ºhrer Alfred Ittner, who took from them all the valuables, such as gold and other jewelry. Once they were in the gas chamber, Walter Nowak and the brothers Josef Wolf and Franz Wolf, the cast-off clothes were brought to the nearby barracks for luggage and sorting. Then came the command of Rudolf Beckmann and Paul Groth; all papers, documents and objects that were not in the sorting barracks were stuffed in bags and brought to the cremation ground. Then, the ground was raked. \\"All this had to happen at a fast pace, so that subsequently the next group of Jews could be gassed in the same way as quickly as possible.\\"Schelvis: Vernichtungslager Sobib√≥r. p. 82 Managing director and death He also worked as managing director in the so-called Forest House, in which the management of the camp was located. The plans of the rebels stipulated that Beckmann and Thomas Steffl should be killed there. He was covertly killed, along with 10 other German guards and an unknown number of Ukrainian auxiliary guards during the camp uprising. When his death was discovered by SS-Oberscharf√ºhrer Erich Bauer, the escape plan was forced to proceed earlier than planned.

The Vidbo Runestones are two Viking Age memorial runestones that are located in the churchyard of the Vidbo church, which is about ten kilometers east of Knivsta, Uppsala County, Sweden, in the historic province of Uppland. U 375 U 375 at the Vidbo Church. Uppland Runic Inscription 375 or U 375 is the Rundata catalog listing for a granite runestone that is 1.9 meters in height which consists of runic text carved in the younger futhark on two serpents which bracket a figure on a horse and a bird. Several other Scandinavian runestones include depictions of horses, including DR 96 in √Ölum, N 61 in Alstad, S√∂ 101 in Ramsundsberget, S√∂ 226 in Norra Stutby, S√∂ 239 in H√§ringe, S√∂ 327 in G√∂ksten, U 488 in Harg, U 599 in Hanunda, U 691 in S√∂derby, U 855 in B√∂ksta, U 901 in H√•m√∂, U 935 at the Uppsala Cathedral, and U 1003 in Fr√∂tuna. The two serpents have fetters around their necks and, near the bottom of the inscription, their tails, perhaps intended to bind them to the stone. The runic text is read clockwise from the head of the right-hand serpent and then from the tail of the serpent on the left. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr2, which is also known as Ringerike style. This is the classification for runic text bands that have attached serpent or beast heads depicted as seen in profile. U 375 was described by one runic scholar as being a \\"good example\\" of a stone carved in style Pr2. p. 121. Records from the 1600s indicate that the runestone was in three pieces in the churchyard, where it was later reconstructed and raised. The runic text states that the stone was raised by two parents named Sigfastr and Ginnlaug in memory of their son Vinaman, and states that he died in a location listed in the text as buhi. While some scholars consider this location to be uninterpretted, others have suggested that it translates as B√≥gi and refers to a former Viking Age harbor in Gotland. The name Boge today survives for a Gotland synod. pp. 183-85. There are several other runestones which mention Gotland, including S√∂ 174 in Asp√∂, the now-lost U 414 in Norrsunda, U 527 in Fr√∂tuna, U 614 in Tors√§tra, DR 220 in S√∏nder Kirkeby, DR 259 in Fuglie, and possibly S√∂ 47 in V√•lsta, where the text has been damaged. The runes aukinla-h on the stone, which translate as \\"and Ginnlaug,\\" follow the rule that double consonants are represented with only a single consonant, even if one of the two consonants are at the end of one word and the second is at the beginning of the next word. The transliteration of the runic text for these words, auk kinla-h, shows word divisions and a separate k-rune for each of the two words.

U 376 Uppland Runic Inscription 376 or U 376 is the Rundata catalog listing for a runestone located in the Vidbo churchyard. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. The text indicates that the inscription was carved by a runemaster with a normalized name of Sten. U 376 is the only surviving runestone that was signed by this runemaster. The runic text states that the stone was raised by Inga in memory of her son Ragni, who was the husband of a second sponsor named Ragnhildr. The inscriptions states that the sponsors also had a bridge made in memory of Ragni. The reference to bridge-building is similar to that on other runestones during this period. Some are Christian references related to passing the bridge into the afterlife. At this time, the Catholic Church sponsored the building of roads and bridges through a practice similar to the use of indulgences in return for the church's intercession for the soul of the departed. pp. 490-492. The text also refers to the raising of \\"stones,\\" suggesting that a second runestone was also raised, with perhaps a stone originally located near each end of the bridge. Since U 376 is currently located at the Vidbo church, the stone was likely moved from its original location and then brought to the church. Before the historic significance of runestones was understood, they were often reused as materials in the construction of churches, walls, and roads.

The power station is located south of Muzaffarabad, and has an installed capacity of 969 MW. Construction on the project began in 2008 after a Chinese consortium was awarded the construction contract in July 2007. After delay of many years, the first generator was commissioned in April 2018 and the entire project was completed in August 2018 when the fourth and last unit was synchronized with the national grid on 13 August and attained its maximum generation capacity of 969 MW on 14 August 2018. It will generate 5,150 GWh (gigawatt hour) per year at the levelised tariff of Rs 13.50 per unit for 30 years. The plant has managed to reach 1040 MW production on a few occasions, which is beyond its capacity and a rare precedence in hydel power sector.https://www.dawn.com/news/1475055/neelum-jhelum-generates-power-beyond- its-installed-capacity Background After being approved in 1989, the design was improved, increasing the tunnel length and generation capacity. The project was intended to begin in 2002 and be completed in 2008 but this time- frame experienced significant delays due to problems meeting rising costs. Additionally, the 2005 Kashmir earthquake which devastated the region required a redesign of the project to conform to more stringent seismic standards. On 7 July 2007, the Chinese consortium CGGC-CMEC (Gezhouba Group and China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation) were offered a contract to construct the dam and power station. Terms were settled by the end of the year and in January 2008, the letter of commencement was issued. On 8 February, Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf announced that the project would begin. In October 2011, the diversion tunnel required to reroute the Neelum River around the dam site was completed. On 1 November, Pakistan's Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani publicly stated his concern for the project's delay. At its appraisal in 1989, it was to cost $167 million USD (2011) and after another redesign in 2005, that cost rose to $935 million USD (2011). Currently costs have risen to $2.89 billion USD (2011). The project was constructed under the supervision of the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and funding was achieved through the Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company, taxes, bond offerings, middle- eastern and Chinese banks. WAPDA successfully secured loans from a consortium of Chinese banks and from Middle East. Tunnel-boring machines (TBM) were brought to help speed up the excavation of the remaining tunnels. They became operational in February 2013. The project was 66 percent complete as of August 2013 while at the same time the diversion tunnel was 75 percent complete. US$475 million in funding was still not secured by the Economic Affairs Division at that time. In mid-2014, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif visited the construction site and expressed the hope that at least one generator would be operational by mid-2015. On 24 December 2014 a wall near the diversion tunnel's intake collapsed, killing four workers including a Chinese engineer. On 5 November 2016, the project entered into terminal phase with 100 percent perfect design while achieving 85.5 percent progress and is heading towards completion despite all delays in release of funds, weather conditions, non- availability of power during early stage of construction and delays in land acquisition. In March 2017, it was reported that the cost of the dam had escalated to PKR 500 billion. thus the cost of electricity from Neelum Jhelum will be Pakistani Rupees 20 per unit. All the civil work including tunnel boring, installation of generators and turbines was completed and water filling of the dam began on 17 October 2017 to put it on the test. https://tribune.com.pk/story/1534015/water-filling-begins-neelum-jhelum- project/ In October 2017, residents of Muzaffarabad expressed serious concerns that the commissioning of Neelum Jhelum project will drastically reduce the flow of Neelum river thru Muzaffarabad town. In January 2018, it was reported that the retaining wall of the rock filled dam has got shifted by 18mm from its original position in Nov 2017 when the dam was loaded to design height of 1017 meter. The electricity generation from the dam may be delayed to June- July 2018. In early March 2018, it was reported that the filling of water in the head race tunnel has started and the first unit will start electricity generation by end-March, followed by the second, third and fourth units at one month intervals respectively https://tribune.com.pk/story/1648558/2-hydel- power-neelum-jhelum-set-start-electricity-generation/ In April 2018, the first unit of 242.25 MW was commissioned at a levelised tariff of Rs 13.50 per unit. The strategically crucial Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project achieved a historic landmark, as the project attained its maximum generation capacity of 969 megawatts (MW) on 14 August 2018. All units of the project are generating power to their maximum capacity. Impact of India's Kishanganga Project In 2007, India began construction of a run-of-the-river power station on the Neelum River (called Kishanganga in India) upstream of the Neelum‚ÄìJhelum Dam. The Kishanganga Hydroelectric Plant operates in a similar way to the Neelum‚ÄìJhelum, using a dam to divert a portion of the Neelum waters () to a power station before it is discharged into Bonar Nalla, another tributary of Jhelum. Pakistan has estimated that, as a result of the Kishanganga project, it would experience a 21 percent reduction in the waters of Neelum in Pakistan, causing a 10 percent reduction in the power generated by Neelum‚ÄìJhelum. The reduction is not significant because 70 percent of the waters of Neelum are generated within Pakistan-administered Kashmir.Ramaswamy R. Iyer, Arbitration & Kishenganga project, The Hindu 25 June 2010. In 2010, Pakistan raised a dispute under the Indus Waters Treaty, taking it to the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The court ruled that India was permitted to divert waters from one tributary to another for power generation, and it had priority as it started the Kishanganga project before Neelum‚ÄìJhelum. The Kishanganga project became operational on 19 May 2018. Design and operation The Neelum‚ÄìJhelum Dam is a tall and long gravity dam. It withholds a pondage (reservoir) with a capacity of which is peak storage. The dam diverts up to of the Neelum southeast into a long head-race tunnel, the first of the head-race is two tunnels which later meet into one. The tunnel passes below the Jhelum River and through its bend.

For years Rosado taught at the rural schools in the towns of Ceiba and Humacao. Ponce massacre On March 21, 1937, Rosado was listening to the radio, where she heard the events involving what is known as the Ponce massacre.

The outcome of the Ponce massacre served as an influential factor in her decision to join the Nationalist Party and to become a follower of Pedro Albizu Campos. Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s On May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and nationalist movements on the archipelago. The Senate, which at the time was controlled by the Partido Popular Democr√°tico (PPD) and presided by Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, approved the bill.\\"La obra jur√≠dica del Profesor David M. Helfeld (1948-2008)'; by: Dr. Carmelo Delgado Cintr√≥n This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law, technically \\"Law 53 of 1948\\") when the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero, signed it into law on June 10, 1948. Under this new law it became a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both. According to Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa, a non-PPD member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, the law was repressive and was in violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution which guarantees Freedom of Speech. He pointed out that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico.La Gobernaci√≥n de Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero y la Guerra Fr√≠a On October 30, 1950, Nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos ordered an uprising by the against United States Government rule of Puerto Rico and against the approval of the creation of the political status \\"Free Associated State\\" (\\"Estado Libre Associado\\") for Puerto Rico which was considered a colonial farce.Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico-FBI files The uprisings occurred in various towns, among them Pe√±uelas, Mayag√ºez, Naranjito, Arecibo and Ponce, of which the most notable occurrences being in Utuado, where the insurgents were massacred, Jayuya, the town where the \\"Free Republic of Puerto Rico\\" was declared, and which was heavily damaged by the military in response to the insurrection, and in San Juan where the Nationalists made an attempt against then-Governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n at his residence \\"La Fortaleza\\". Even though Rosado did not participate in the revolts, she was accused by the US Government in doing so. She was occupied in her job as a school social worker when the police came and arrested her. Rosado was sentenced to serve fifteen months in jail and fired from her job. Since she was unable to earn a living in the public school system, she obtained a position in a private school. On March 1, 1954, four Puerto Rican nationalists, Lolita Lebr√≥n, Rafael Cancel Miranda, Andres Figueroa Cordero, and Irvin Flores Rodr√≠guez, shot 30 rounds from semi-automatic pistols from the Ladies' Gallery (a balcony for visitors) of the House of Representatives chamber in the United States Capitol.

The following morning the police attacked the Nationalist headquarters in San Juan with tear gas. Albizu Campos was carried out unconscious and those in the building, including Rosado were arrested and imprisoned. Rosado was sentenced to serve eleven years in prison. She was released from prison in 1965, via a Habeas Corpus. Later years In 1979, Rosado participated in an ecumenical prayer service on Vieques naval territory.

There is evidence he was called to the bar, and practised as a barrister. He died in Crane Lane Court, Fleet Street, London in 1690. Works Molloy was the compiler of an extensive treatise on maritime law and commerce, entitled De Jure Maritimo et Navali. It was successful despite its derivative nature:Nine editions in London:1676, 1677, 1682, 1688, 1690, 1707, 1722, 1744, 1769, 1778. its content was not much advance on the Consuetudo vel Lex Mercatoria by Gerard Malynes, and the coverage of law concerning bills of exchange was said by a later authorJames Kent, Commercial and Maritime Law, p. 122. to be inferior to the treatise of John Marius. It was a standard work on the subject, till superseded by the publications of James Alan Park, Samuel Marshall, and Lord Tenterden.

He entered Trinity College, Dublin, obtained a scholarship in 1701, and graduated B.A. in 1703. In 1729, Prior published his 'List of Absentees of Ireland' which condemned absentee Irish landlords, named those he considered delinquent and garnered himself some notoriety in doing so. Prior subsequently devoted himself to economic promotion, working among the Protestant population in Ireland. With Samuel Madden and eleven other friends, Prior in 1731 established the Dublin Society for the Promotion of Agriculture, Manufactures, Arts, and Sciences, at a meeting of held in Trinity College, 25 June 1731;A Compendium of Irish Biography others involved included Francis Bindon, Patrick Delany, and Sir Thomas Molyneux.

An area of disturbed weather was first detected on September 11 near Ponape. After moving westward, the system gradually became better organized and thunderstorm activity increased. On September 16, the system attained tropical storm status. Two days later, Clara attained typhoon intensity and subsequently began to deepen at a faster rate. On September 19, Clara reached maximum intensity, before making landfall along the northern tip of Luzon. Clara steadily weakened after interacting with land, but by late on September 20, Clara leveled off in intensity over the South China Sea. The next day, Clara moved ashore to the east-northeast of Hong Kong while still at typhoon intensity before rapidly dissipating over land. In the Philippines, 55 people perished. A total of 7,125 homes were damaged and 1,195 houses were destroyed, which left nearly 4,000 people homeless in one province alone. Damage was estimated at $13.4 million (1981 USD), mostly from crops. Offshore, two ships were wrecked, leading to 79 fatalities, although 48 others were rescued. Across China, almost of farmland were flooded or destroyed, several thousand individuals lost their homes, and 62 people were killed.  Meteorological history  An area of disturbed weather was first detected by satellite imagery on the afternoon of September 11 near Ponape embedded in the monsoon trough. The disturbance tracked westward, with its development aided by a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough that provided divergence aloft. Despite some wind shear, thunderstorm activity increased in organization and coverage by the afternoon on September 13. At 18:00 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the cyclone, classifying it as a tropical depression. Less than two hours later, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Thunderstorm activity continued to increase as the shear relaxed, and at 19:23 UTC on September 14, the TCFA was re-issued. After passing south of Guam, the JTWC initiated warnings on the system early on September 15. Eighteen hours later, the JTWC classified the system as a tropical storm. At 18:00 UTC on September 16, the JMA did the same. Upon becoming a tropical storm, the JTWC initially expected Clara to track into Luzon. At 18:00 UTC on September 17, the JMA declared Clara a severe tropical storm. The same day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started monitoring the storm and assigned it with the local name Rubing. By September 18, the JTWC had modified its forecast and called for the storm to re-curve out to sea in response to a weakness in a ridge to its north, but this weakness was only enough to enable a west-northwest track. After satellite images indicated that Clara developed an eye, both the JTWC and JMA reported that Clara had intensified into a typhoon, and subsequently began to rapidly intensify. Midday on September 19, the JTWC raised the intensity of Clara to , equal to low-end Category 4 intensity on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). At this time, hurricane hunters measured a barometric pressure of . However, the JMA estimated a slightly higher pressure of . At 18:00 UTC on September 19, the JTWC estimated a peak wind speed of while the JMA reported a peak intensity of . At 22:00 UTC, the typhoon briefly made landfall on the northern tip of Luzon at the same intensity, with the storm passing approximately north of Calayan. After entering the South China Sea, the typhoon began to move northwest, but a ridge to its north prevented re-curvature. The storm weakened some due to land interaction, but leveled off in intensity late on September 20. At 12:00 the next day, Clara made landfall around east-northwest of Hong Kong, or near Shanwei, with the JTWC and JMA reporting winds of and respectively. Clara rapidly dissipated over the hilly terrain of China, but the JMA did not cease tracking its remnants until October 2, after the storm turned to the north and reached 56¬∞N.  Impact  Near where the storm made landfall in northern Luzon, winds of and a pressure of was reported. In the city of Baguio, several small landslides occurred. There, a total of 36 families sought shelter in higher ground due to floodwaters high while many towns in the surrounding area were isolated. Throughout the Cagayan province, 3,725 people were rendered homeless and property damage totaled $1.8 million. Nationwide, 55 people died. Nearly 48,000 people sought shelter. A total of 7,125 homes were damaged and 1,195 houses were destroyed. Damage was estimated at $13.4 million, with $10.9 million from crops, $2 million from public infrastructure, and roughly $500,000 from private infrastructure. Offshore Calayan Island, the vessel Datu Kalantiaw was wrecked by a coral reef, with 19 of the 97 people necessitating rescue. A total of 52 bodies from the shipwreck were recovered and the remaining others were presumed dead. Additionally, the ship Sweet Trip sank offshore Zamboanga del Norte Province; 29 of the 30 people aboard were rescued and the remaining person was presumed dead. Twelve victims sustained injures. To search for the missing, authorities dispatched four helicopters, one C-130 transport plane, and an ammunition ship. The United States Navy also provided some assistance initially, but gave up searching on September 23. While the typhoon passed just south of Dongsha Islands, winds of and a pressure of were measured. Across China, 62 people were killed. In the Fujian province, nearly of rice paddies and of sugar cane were damaged. Many highways were impassable and there was widespread loss of communication. About of farmland were flooded in Shantou alone, where winds of were recorded. Several thousand people were homeless due to the flooding. In Hong Kong, a No 1. hurricane signal was issued on September 20. The next day, the signal was increased to a No 3. hurricane signal. All signals were dropped after the typhoon moved inland. On Cheung Chau, a peak wind speed of and a peak wind gust of was reported. Tate's Cairn observed of rain over a 24-hour period, the highest in the region.

It is a 1936 replica of a structure that had been erected circa 1779 by Nacogdoches militia commander Antonio Gil Y'Barbo. The original building was never a fort, in spite of its sobriquet. After more than a century serving various purposes, the original structure was demolished. The replica was erected with help from the local Cum Concilio civic organization, and funding from the New Deal economic program of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. The museum is open to visitors and provides historic exhibits on the grounds of the university. Origins and history The original Old Stone Fort was built of native iron ore, circa 1779, as a mercantile house by Antonio Gil Y'Barbo. Because of its iron-brick construction, it was referred to as the Stone House. In 1805, he sold the structure to Jos√© Luis de la Bega, and in 1806, Bega sold it to William Barr. Along with fellow merchants Peter Samuel Davenport, Luther Smith, and Edward Murphy, Barr operated the House of Barr and Davenport, an import-export business catering to the indigenous tribes of the area. Davenport established his headquarters as the Nacogdoches agent for the firm in the Old Stone Fort. Davenport outlived his partners‚ÄîSmith died in 1807, Murphy in 1808, and Barr in 1810‚Äîleaving Davenport as the sole proprietor. During the next several years, the structure also served as various government facilities. Article by Lee C. Harby entitled \\"The Old Stone Fort of Nacogdoches\\" published in left In a prelude to the Fredonian Rebellion, Benjamin Haden, brother to Empresario Haden Edwards, led several followers in seizing the building on December 16, 1826. Shortly thereafter, Col. Jos√© de las Piedras used the structure as his headquarters. In 1829, John Marie Durst purchased the Stone House from Juan Benigno Davenport, Peter Samuel Davenport's son and heir. Durst and his family lived there until 1834 when he sold it to Vicente C√≥rdova. In 1837, the Republic of Texas used the structure as a courtroom under Judge Robert McAlpin Williamson, who also was known as Three-legged Willie. In 1838, C√≥rdova sold the structure to John S. Roberts, one of the signers of the Texas Declaration of Independence. Roberts, a former sheriff of Natchitoches, had participated in the battle of Nacogdoches in 1832 and the Siege of B√©xar in 1835. He operated a variety of commercial ventures in the structure before selling it to William and Charles Perkins. They became the last owners of the original building. Current structure The Perkins family dismantled the building in 1902, but some of its original stones were preserved by Cum Concilio, a civic organization in Nacogdoches. In 1907, the club used the stones for a small building in Washington Square. Decades later, the New Deal economic program of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration provided funding for the construction of a replica of the old fort on the grounds of Stephen F. Austin State College. Dedication ceremonies were held October 16, 1936. The Building became a museum, which is open to visitors and hosts historic exhibits.

It is the only US military command located in South America. Its mission is to identify infectious diseases threats of military and public health importance and to develop and evaluate interventions and products to mitigate those threats. NAMRU-6 consists of of laboratory and office space in Lima; 5000 square feet of lab space in Iquitos, Peru and 2000 square feet of lab space in Puerto Maldonado, Peru. The Lima facility includes Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) facilities, while the other two laboratories are only biosafety level 2 rated. The Lima facility also contains a vivarium for animal research that is Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) certified. Mission Implementation of NAMRU-6‚Äôs mission is via threefold means: # to investigate prophylactic agents such as vaccines and pharmaceuticals against tropical infectious diseases which cause severe mortality or morbidity to the US military member in the deployed environment. Generally the focus of study is ‚Äùorphan‚Äù illnesses with little or no investment by major pharmaceutical companies and includes parasitic infection such as malaria and leishmaniasis, viral diseases such as dengue fever and other arboviruses, and bacterial illnesses like traveler‚Äôs diarrhea (ETEC, campylobacter, shigella). # to augment public health and military medical infrastructure of host and partner nations by assisting in surveillance of outbreaks and providing laboratory surge capacity during pandemics. # to provide assistance in training host nation scientists in epidemiologic techniques or modern laboratory molecular biology methods. Via these collaborations with partner nations, the NAMRU gets to conduct research on diseases that threaten troops on deployment but are not commonly seen in the US, and to get advanced notice of impending pandemics such as avian influenza that might affect military operational readiness. The host nation benefits by getting access to state of the art treatments and protection against diseases endemic to their country and a more robust public health infrastructure and better trained microbiology and physician population. This results in both military and political benefits to both nations and as such all NAMRU personnel are considered diplomats and counted as members of the US embassy in the host country. Partner nations include ministries of Defense or Health in Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Ecuador, Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Colombia. The lab conducts research throughout Peru including the cities and districts of Arequipa, Cuzco, Junin, La Libertad, Lambayeque, Madre De Dios, Piura, San Martin, Tumbes, Puno, Lima, Loreto and Ucayali. All animal research conducted at NAMRU-6 is subject to approval by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)and all human research conducted by NAMRU-6 is conducted under supervision of duly constituted Institutional Review Board (IRB). History The idea for NAMRU-6 originated in 1978 with an idea of ADM Dileo- Paoli, the Peruvian Surgeon General, who proposed to the US Navy Surgeon General to establish a program of tropical medicine with joint participation between the US and Peruvian Navies. The command began with the arrival of 4 US Navy Active duty members under the Officer in Charge, CDR Michael Kilpatrick on January 20, 1983. NAMRU-6 was signed into agreement on October 21, 1983 in Lima between Fernando Schwalb Lopez Aldan, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Peru and Ambassador Frank V. Ortiz. This agreement was further signed by RADM Jorge Tenorio De la Fuente, the Peruvian Surgeon General and VADM Lewis H. Seaton the US Navy Surgeon General in Washington D.C. on November 14, 1983. On Jan 6th 1984, The US Chief of Naval Operations established the laboratory as a detachment of Naval Medical Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, it was then known as the acronym NMRID. In December 1983, Rear Admiral Roger F Milnes represented the US Navy Surgeon General in a ceremony laying the cornerstone of the new 7330 meter facility, jointly funded by the Peruvian and US Navies. This first building was inaugurated on July 4, 1985 by the President of Peru, the Architect Fernando Belaunde Terry and the US Ambassador David Jordan. An annex building for animal research was inaugurated in 1987. The facility was one of the first in Peru to be able to work with BSL-3 agents such as Brucella melitensis, Yersinia pestis and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis. Additionally in July 1985, the first clinics of investigation were inaugurated on the grounds of the Naval Clinic in Iquitos, Peru. In 1998, NAMRU-6 became part of the newly reorganized Naval Medical Research Center. The Base Re-alignment and Closure (BRAC) process had ordered the closure of NMRI on the Bethesda campus and its relocation to the Walter Reed Forest Glen Annex with Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, where it was established as Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), NAMRID was subsequently renamed as NMRCD to reflect the change of name of its parent command. On 16 November 2010, NMRCD officially changed its command status from a detachment of NMRC with an officer-in-charge, to a full command, NAMRU-6 with a commanding officer. A modern laboratory facility was constructed and inaugurated in Iquitos in July 2005 by US Ambassador Curtis Struble and Vice Admiral Jose Ricardo Rafael Aste Daffos, the head of Amazonian Operations for the Peruvian Navy. The civilian staff has been awarded the Department of the Navy Award of Merit for Group Achievement twice, once in 1990 and again from 1995-1997. Important scientific achievements include completing a Cholera vaccine field efficacy trial on 18,000 volunteers in Peru in 1993, development of an FDA approved rapid malaria diagnostic test (BinaxNow) from 1996‚Äì2001, the first clinical descriptions of Mayaro virus in 1999, the first identification of novel strains of dengue in Peru in 2000-1, investigations of HIV and hepatitis, conducting field efficacy trials resulting in region specific national malaria treatment guidelines in 2000, association of spotted fever rickettsia with an outbreak of febrile illness in 2004, demonstrating superiority of glucantime to pentamidine therapy for cutaneous leishmaniasis in 2005, developing non-human primate models of campylobacter and Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli diarrhea, a field trial of 2 yellow fever vaccines in children in 2005, and the discovery of Iquitos virus in 2010.

On the island are the remains of several churches built between the fourth and sixth centuries AD, along with a variety of associated buildings. Archaeologists believe it was the location of the original tomb of Saint Nicholas. History The Byzantine ruins of five Greek churches built between the fourth and sixth centuries AD remain on the island, along with a processional walkway. Other remains from the same period include around forty other ecclesiastical buildings and over fifty Christian tombs. One of the churches was cut directly from the rock at the island's highest point, and is located at the far western end of the processional walkway. It is possible that the Island was used by Christian pilgrims en route to the Holy Lands. Modern archaeologists believe that the island may be the location of St. Nicholas' original tomb. The traditional Turkish name for the island is Gemiler Adasƒ±, meaning \\"Island of Boats\\", which may be a reference to St. Nicholas's role as the patron saint of sailors; the island was also referred to as St. Nicholas Island by seafarers in the medieval period. Archaeologists believe he was interred in the rock-hewn church following his death in 326. His relics remained there until the 650s, when the island was abandoned as it was threatened by an Arab fleet. They were then moved to the town of Myra some to the east. Economy The island is currently a popular destination for large Turkish gulets (for instance from Olu Deniz), bringing many tourists to the island as well as many smaller private boats since the crescent-shaped bay can be used as a safe anchorage. The Byzantine ruins can be seen from the sea. A small makeshift restaurant stands in the bay for the summer sailors. The owners do not live on the island, but return to the mainland when there are no boats around. A charge of 10TL is currently levied upon visitors to the ruins.

Life He was born in the north of Ireland, and was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated B.A. and M.B. in 1676, and M.D. in 1684. In the latter year he was apparently elected fellow of the College of Physicians in Ireland. He attempted original research in anatomy, and became a prominent member of the Dublin Philosophical Society, to which he contributed valuable papers on human and comparative anatomy. The most important was that in which he described the vascularity of the lens of the eye, to the discovery of which he appears to have been led by the dissection of an elephant. On 18 July 1683 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. A discreditable love affair obliged him to remove to London in 1686, and thence he went with William O'Brien, 2nd Earl of Inchiquin, in 1690 to the West Indies, hoping to improve his fortunes by the discovery of some mines there. He died soon after landing at Barbados from the effects of intoxication. Works Mullen published 'An Anatomical Account of the Elephant accidentally burnt in Dublin on 17 June 1681; together with a Relation of new Anatomical Observations on the Eyes of Animals. By A. M.,' &c.;, 2 pts. 4to, London, 1682. His examination was made with such accuracy that his descriptions have been quoted by writers down to the present time. The 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1685 contain an account of his dissection of a 'monstrous double cat' (xv. 1135). In the volume for 1687, he gave a close estimate of the quantity of blood contained in the body (xvi. 433). His experiments 'On the Injection of Mercury into the Blood' (xvii. 486), 'On a Black shining Sand brought from Virginia' (xvii. 624), and 'Anatomical Observations on the Heads of Fowls' (xvii. 711) are also recorded. His discovery of several structures in the tunics of the eye is acknowledged by Albrecht von Haller.

Beevers was a member of the National Academy of SciencesNew York Times:Academy of Sciences Elects 60 New Members and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Beevers received honorary doctorates from Purdue University, the University of Nagoya in Japan, and Newcastle University on Tyne in England. Oxford University honored Beevers by naming a building in his name, the Harry Beevers Laboratory. Beevers received Stephen Hales Prize in 1970 and Charles Reid Barnes Life Membership Award in 1999. Career and life Early life Harry Beevers was born in Shildon, County Durham in the north east of England in on January 10, 1924. His parents felt strongly about the benefits of education and six of their eight children (of whom Harry was the second) went on to earn university degrees. At the age of six the family moved to Upper Weardale where Harry attended schools in Wearhead and St. John's Chapel. He went on to attend Wolsingham Grammar School. While at Wolsingham, Harry had aspired to become a teacher specialising in woodwork, arts and crafts. However, due to wartime shortages the school were unable to teach the courses in these fields. It was at this point he discovered science while under the tutorage of David Hughes, the school biology teacher.  Durham University  Going on to university, he graduated from King's College in Newcastle upon Tyne (then part of Durham University) with a BSc. first class honours degree in botany. The course was part of an accelerated wartime degree programme. As he was attending university during the Second World War Harry undertook fire- watching duties at night on campus. His companions included members of the faculty, among whose number was Professor Meirion Thomas. Thomas went on to become Beevers' Ph.D. mentor. After gaining his BS.c. he received a deferment on his military service and began his doctoral research. This was completed in 1946 when he received his Ph.D. in plant physiology. Beevers added to his student grant through beating at grouse hunts and gathering rose hips which were made into a vitamin C rich dietary supplement.  Oxford University  Harry went on to be assistant, then chief research assistant, in the laboratory of W.O. James at Oxford University. It was here that Harry looked at the biosynthesis of tropane alkaloids. Progress was hampered by the technology available so Beevers moved on to other matters. These included the high rate of respiration of the spadix of Arum maculatum. While at Oxford he also collaborated with Eric Simon which lead to the publication of an academic paper in 1952. This came from their work looking at the uptake of weak acids and weak bases by plants.  Purdue University  Realising that work opportunities were limited in the United Kingdom, Beevers secured a one-year appointment as an assistant professor at Purdue University in the Department of Biology in the United States. This position was secured through R. E. Girton, a Purdue plant physiologist who was taking a sabbatical year in W. O. James' Oxford laboratory. In 1950, not long after his arrival in America, Harry attended his first meeting of the American Society of Plant Physiologists in Columbus, Ohio. An organisation to which he was elected President, serving the period 1961‚Äì62. It was also in this period at Purdue that he became a United States citizen.  University of California  Beevers was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1969, the same year Professor Kenneth Thimann a member of the Academy, persuaded Harry to join the biology department at the University of California in Santa Cruz.  Personal Life and Family  While at Wolsingham Grammar School, Beevers met Jean Sykes whom he married in 1949. In 1961, Harry's brother Leonard Beevers (d. 2014) made the journey to America with his wife Pat. Also a plant physiologist where he worked on nitrogen metabolism.  Later life  Harry Beevers died at his home in Carmel in California on April 14, 2004 following a brief illness. He was survived by his wife Jean Beevers, son Michael Beevers, sisters Win Allinson, Edna Emerson, Elsie Chapman and Vera West. Along with two brothers, Alec Beevers and Leonard Beevers. He also had and one granddaughter.

He went to Paris in 1808 as a medical student. There he studied under Fran√ßois Magendie, wrote a thesis on the physiology of the eye, and became Magendie's assistant. Edwards was naturalised in France in 1828, Claude Blanckaert, Un fil d‚ÄôAriane dans le labyrinthe des origines‚Ä¶ Langues, races et classification ethnologique au XIXe si√®cle. and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1829.Royal Society database, Edwards; William Frederick.

Scientific works Edwards began independent research in 1815‚Äì6, working on manganese oxide compounds with Pierre Chevillot. At the same time he began investigations on asphyxia in animals.Charles Richet, William Milne Edwards: La Chaleur Animale: 1777‚Äì1842 (1893), p. 9; archive.org. Edwards was a vitalist who studied the effect of physical forces on processes in living organisms. His work led to the book De l'influence des agens physiques sur la vie (1824) (English translation by Thomas Hodgkin). Edwards was following a direction in Lavoisier's research on \\"animal chemistry\\", and addressing questions raised in Magendie's journal. He carried out experimental work at the Coll√®ge de France. Racial theories Edwards was influenced by Am√©d√©e Thierry,Martin S. Staum, Labeling People: French scholars on society, race and empire, 1815‚Äì1848 (2003), p. 129; Google Books. to whom he addressed his 1829 essay Des caract√®res physiologiques des races humaines consid√©r√©s dans leurs rapports avec l'histoire.Staffan M√ºller-Wille, Hans-J√∂rg Rheinberger, Heredity Produced: at the crossroads of biology, politics, and culture, 1500‚Äì1870 (2007), p. 363; Google Books. Thierry had studied the backgrounds of the Gauls and Franks of the Late Antique period in France. Edwards took up a theory of \\"permanence of types\\", influenced also by Ren√© Primev√®re Lesson. As related by Edwards, he had been convinced of such a permanence since the early 1820s, when on a visit to London he was discussing the works of James Cowles Prichard with Hodgkin and Robert Knox. Knox convinced him, with the help of an Ancient Egyptian tomb exhibited by Giovanni Battista Belzoni, that Egyptian and other ethnic \\"types\\" persisted from antiquity. As Edwards made clear, his notion of \\"type\\" was flexible; and racial types became fundamental to 19th century debate on ethnology.Martin Bulmer (editor), Racism, Oxford Readers (1999), p. 35; PDF. He followed on from the studies of Johann Kaspar Lavater and Franz Joseph Gall in physiognomy, and pioneered the concept of race as determined by the shape of the face and head. He supplemented his physiological work with a study of the Celtic languages. Stendhal took his ideas on race from Edwards, who in fact established the concept of ethnologie (ethnology) in France.Bronwen Douglas, Chris Ballard (editors), Foreign Bodies: Oceania and the science of race 1750‚Äì1940 (2008), p. 53;Google Books. Another personal contact among writers was Jules Michelet: Edwards became his physician, and Michelet took ideas about \\"persistence of races\\" from Edwards and Thierry. This theorising applied very much to Europeans and particularly French people, and Edwards believed his own observations confirmed it. Edwards has been called the first anthropologist to discuss race. One of his concerns was justification of French nationalism. Edwards came to theorise broadly about human diversity, influenced by polygenism, and argued in favour of fixed types and characters attached to populations. He undermined the environmentalist monogenism of Prichard, in which climate had affected human populations after a single creation: he made a point of discounting the influence of climate on animal physiology in general. A remark he made about cross-bred animal populations, to the effect that one type comes to predominate, was quoted by Charles Darwin in The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication.s:The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication/XV Soci√©t√© Ethnologique de Paris and its influence Edwards followed up his work correlating physiological characteristics with races, and other interests, by the foundation in 1839 of the Soci√©t√© Ethnologique de Paris, with a broader programme including also languages and traditions; its goal was to define human groups and identify their origins. The foundation of the Ethnological Society of New York and Ethnological Society of London followed within a few years.Paul Broca, History of the Proceedings of the Anthropological Society of Paris, in Anthropological Review (1863) vol. 1 II p. 278; archive.org. When Paul Broca founded the Soci√©t√© d'Anthropologie de Paris in 1859, he drew on the definition Edwards had given of ethnology.

Part Three emphasizes applications. Reviews and influence Reviews have appeared in PsycCRITIQUES, Practical Matters, the Journal of Psychosocial Research, Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies, Psycho-Oncology, and Choice. In PsycCRITIQUES, Edward F. Bourg stated that \\"in a time full of sensory and information overload, this is a welcome book.\\" While mindfulness \\"has entered the popular imagination as a curative factor\\" for health and well-being, this book shows that many other forms of contemplative practice are also being used successfully. The book's \\"twofold\\" premise is that both Eastern and Western traditions have a contemplative side, and \\"Doing, not saying, is what counts.\\" He stated that although generally \\"the various chapters are very well integrated,\\" the book \\"isn‚Äôt seamless,\\" and some Part III chapters analyze practices, such as lamentation and fire-walking, that \\"are somewhat unusual... and... would appeal to very few of us.\\" In Practical Matters, Eric J. Kyle of the Claremont School of Theology wrote that the book was \\"a rich source of wisdom [on] the intersection of contemplative practices and... well-being. \\" providing a \\"robust introduction to the breadth of contemplative approaches\\" from \\"various religious traditions.\\", although he wondered why there was no coverage of \\"native or aboriginal spiritualities.\\" In the Journal of Psychosocial Research, Uma Gupta of Banaras Hindu University stated that a \\"strength of this book is its comprehensive identification of issues that are relevant to reducing hypertension in the present era that values speed, productivity and multitasking.\\" To Gupta, the book provides \\"excellent summaries of historical roots, current research, directions for future research and general applications of the contemplative practices from Eastern and Western religious and spiritual traditions.\\" She also described the book as \\"capable of transforming the life of the reader in making life more meaningful, purposeful and joyful.\\" In Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies, KJ Sherman wrote that she found the book \\"unsatisfying,\\" since \\"for many traditions, the studies reported seemed to focus on religious or mental health outcomes, rather than physical health.\\" She found \\"no logic to the traditions included,\\" since they varied greatly in their level of empirical support, and would not recommend the book to healthcare providers or researchers. However, \\"the description of the practices themselves\\" may be useful to \\"healthcare providers whose patient populations may embrace contemplative practices in the context of multiple spiritual traditions,\\" and to \\"religious scholars who want to understand how other practices may be similar to those of their tradition.\\" In Psycho-Oncology, JL Kristeller stated that \\"Even those familiar with selected contemplative traditions should find distinctive perspectives,\\" and that the book \\"lays out a surprising richness of resources related to engaging spiritual well-being though a world heritage of contemplative practices.\\" In Choice, G. R. Thursby of the University of Florida wrote that the book was structured into \\"a meaningful whole that can serve as a tool kit for health care professionals and enable religious leaders to find positive points of contact,\\". He stated that \\"among the best in the book\\" are the three chapters about Easwaran's Passage Meditation, Keating's Centering Prayer, and Delbecq's meditation program for Silicon Valley leaders.

A fable attributed to Aesop was eventually created about the two creatures and later still yet another fable concerning a crab and its offspring was developed to make the same point. The fables and their origin The first known mention of the snake and the crab is found in a drinking song dating from the late 6th or early 5th century BCE: ::::The crab spoke thus, ::::seizing the snake in its claws, ::::'One‚Äôs comrade should be straight ::::and not think crooked thoughts.‚ÄôFrancisco Rodr√≠guez Adrados, History of the Graeco-Latin fable I, Brill, Leiden NL 1999, p.146 Since the movement of both creatures is far from direct, this is as much as to say that the pot should not call the kettle black. A later fable, attributed to Aesop and numbered 196 in the Perry Index,Aesopica site relates that the two were once friends. When the snake ignored the crab's advice to lead an honest life, it was killed by the crab. The snake then became rigid and the crab commented that if it had done so earlier it need not have died. The story only appeared in Greek sources until it was included in European collections of the fables during the Renaissance. In England it was recorded by Roger L'EstrangeSee online and Samuel Croxall.Fables of Aesop, London 1722, Fable XII These portray the crab as honest and plain dealing, drawing the moral that one should be straightforward in behaviour and beware of friendship with those who are not. The story had therefore travelled a long way from being an illustration of hypocritical behaviour. The crab and her daughter Scholars believe that the fable of \\"The Two Crabs\\", alternatively known as \\"The Young Crab and its Mother\\" (Perry Index 322),Aesopica site also derives from the original Greek idiom.Francisco Rodr√≠guez Adrados, History of the Graeco-Latin Fable III, Brill, Leiden 2003, p.273 In this version, a young crab is told to walk straight by its mother and asks for a demonstration of how that is done. The story, recorded by Babrius and Aphthonius of Antioch in Greek and by Avianus in Latin, was taken up by William Caxton and later made the subject of new Latin poems by the German Renaissance poets Hieronymus Osius (1564)Text online and Caspar Barth (1612).Text online It is given the moral that those who teach should first set a good example, which at least preserves the bite of the Greek original. In the following century, La Fontaine's Fables subtly subvert the story. He titles it L'√©crevisse et sa fille (The lobster and her daughter, XII.10)Elizur Wright's translation but begins with a eulogy of political deviousness: ::::The wise, sometimes, as lobsters do, ::::To gain their ends back foremost go. ::::It is the rower's art... before telling a fable of a mere five lines out of a total of thirty. The mother instructs her daughter to be straightforward and is answered by an appeal to the force of example, of which the ironical La Fontaine approves. Artistic use Illustrations in fable collections before the 19th century generally portrayed two crabs (or cuttlefish) together on a sandy shore. The same may be said of Vincent van Gogh's painting of \\"Two Crabs\\". While it has been suggested that this is an imitation of a Japanese print,National Museum site it may equally well refer to the fable, which was known as \\"The Two Crabs\\" (De twee krabben in the Netherlands). There have also been a few musical treatments of the fable, including Mabel Wood Hill's setting for piano and voice in Aesop's Fables Interpreted Through Music (1920)Published in New York with words and music and in Edward Hughes Songs from Aesop's fables for children's voices and piano (1965). The earlier fable was set by the German Andre Asriel as Die Schlange und der Krebs for mixed a cappella voices as part of his 6 Fabeln nach Aesop in 1972.Performance on YouTube References External links Illustrations in books from the 15th - 20th century Snake and the Crab Snake and the Crab Snake and the Crab Snake and the Crab ","title":"The Snake and the Crab"},{"id":"34128548","text":"The Tuhutum Monument (; ) was an obelisk in ZalƒÉu, Romania.

A seventeenth-century print of the statue exists in the Teylers Museum, Harlem, the Netherlands.  History  Statue of Saint Bibiana is the first example of this Christian Baroque type. It was commissioned in 1624 by rediscovering of saint's body at the beginning of the pontificate of Urban VIII., who that event considered as a good sign of the beginning of his papacy. Therefore, he initiated rebuilding of the original church in the new Baroque style, also with creating of interior and new high altar of Saint Bibiana. Execution of the works and sculpture was commissioned to Gian Lorenzo Bernini.  Iconography  Statue of St. Bibiana is created as standing female figure draped in a robe along with her attributes column and palm branches. The essence of the work is based on gestures and expressions of St. Bibiana. Her opened mouth and view heading to the skies, evokes emotional conflict of the face. While one hand is holding the palm branch in calm, the other hand lying on the column with forearm gently in front of evoking resistance to story. Statue does not shows the ceratian point of the Saint's life, but only abstract story characterized figure. The more is possible to see emotions of Saint Bibiana and her illusive devotion. The statue is placed in a niche of the altar, which is located at the end of the church. Creating of new unusual window above of the altar brings bright glow of light and supports that mystical feeling of the whole scene. Theatricality and play with light is also created by small windows in vault of the church that illuminates statue of Saint Bibiana itself .  Contemporary Damage  The sculpture was shown as part of the large Bernini retrospective at the Galleria Borghese in Rome (2017-18) On its return to the church of Santa Bibiana, the ring finger of the saint's right hand was broken off.

The Hopewell was expended in an attempt to set light to the French ships, and later volunteered with a boat part that succeeded in firing the French ships. Jumper quickly moved through the command of several fire ships, joining in June 1692, in October 1692 and then the 44-gun in July 1693, before he was given the command of the new ship in March 1694. From 30 October 1698 he was flag captain to Sir Cloudesley Shovell aboard the 66-gun . He was with Swiftsure until 13 July 1699, and returned on 13 September and commanded her until January 1700. Jumper was appointed captain of the newly commissioned third rate ship of the line in 1701.HMS Lennox, threedecks.org, accessed 3 May 2013 Jumper was part of Sir George Rooke's fleet at the attack on Cadiz in 1702. In 1704 he was one of the first captains to set foot on land during the successful capture of Gibraltar. He and Captain Wilkes led troops whilst Edward Whitaker tried to obtain permission for a landing. Jumper was mentioned particularly by Whitaker and he was later honoured by having Jumper's Bastion in Gibraltar named after him. Jumper took part in the Battle of M√°laga on 13 August 1704, sustaining injuries to his back and shoulders during the battle. Jumper was knighted in 1704. Also at this time, he owned a manor house in Yelsted, Kent. After he died, his son William Jumper, esquire owned the house. Jumper went out to the Mediterranean again in 1707, and narrowly avoided the fate of Sir Cloudesley Shovel and almost 2,000 of his men on their return home, when a substantial part of the fleet was shipwrecked on the Scilly Isles. Jumper arrived safely in Falmouth on 22 October 1707. He petitioned for a posting at home after this, and was appointed commissioner at Chatham Dockyard. In 1714 Jumper became resident Navy Commissioner at Plymouth and died on 12 March 1715.A Compendium of Irish Biography He was buried three days later at St Andrew's Church, Plymouth.

It was closer to a Pennsylvania‚ÄìKentucky style rifle than a military styled rifle. Deringer began making these rifles for the army before winning the 1814 contract making 51 rifles that were accepted for military service. One example of these rifles survives today. Unlike the Wickam type, the pre-production model was not iron mounted. The rifle is full stocked, with a 38-inch barrel that is octagon near the flintlock and becomes round about a third of the way down the barrel. It had a long-rectangular bronze patch box mounted in the buttstock. ;Indian rifle A smoothbore version was also under contract with the government as a trade rifle, for sales to the Native Americans.

The project was initiated in June 2011 but canceled in May 2012 due to numerous issues, among which were capacity constraints on the Buckingham Branch Railroad and Federal approval of the train's engineering.  History  Following his purchase of The Greenbrier resort in his native West Virginia, billionaire coal entrepreneur Jim Justice launched a number of new initiatives aimed at reinvigorating the struggling property, including significant renovations, the Greenbrier Classic PGA Tour event, and the construction of a casino. He unveiled concept drawings for the Greenbrier Presidential Express, designed to bring guests to and from the resort, at a June 2011 launch party in Washington, D.C. Efforts to prepare for the new train began with a $15 million investment by Justice to purchase and rehabilitate 15 passenger cars at a plant in Pennsylvania. The train's consist was to have been made up of baggage cars, club cars, and dining cars offering Greenbrier-style luxury. Most cars were to be named after presidents who summered at the resort. The decor for these cars was being supervised by interior designer Carleton Varney, the student of the woman behind the Greenbrier's signature style, Dorothy Draper. Deluxe cocktails would have been served during the 6-hour journey, and plans called for a registered nurse to be on hand to serve the passengers and plan treatments at the resort's spa and medical facilities. Upon arrival, guests would be met by horse-drawn carriages at the station and conveyed across the street to the resort's main building. 4-8-4 steam locomotive No. 614, formerly used by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway was painted in Greenbrier Presidential Express livery intended to eventually serve as the power for the train, it was displayed at Clifton Forge, VA to promote the train. Trains magazine reported in January 2012 that the future of the Presidential Express was in doubt due to capacity problems on the Buckingham Branch Railroad, a problem also affecting plans to make Amtrak's Cardinal (which also serves White Sulphur Springs) a daily train.

Like ductless minisplits, VRFs use refrigerant as the cooling and heating medium. This refrigerant is conditioned by a single or multiple condensing units (which may be outdoors or indoors, water or air cooled), and is circulated within the building to multiple indoor units. VRF systems, unlike conventional chiller-based systems, allow for varying degrees of cooling in only certain areas, reducing energy consumption. Description VRFs are typically installed with an air conditioner inverter which adds a DC inverter to the compressor in order to support variable motor speed and thus variable refrigerant flow rather than simply perform on/off operation. By operating at varying speeds, VRF units work only at the needed rate allowing for substantial energy savings at load conditions. Heat recovery VRF technology allows individual indoor units to heat or cool as required, while the compressor load benefits from the internal heat recovery. Energy savings of up to 55% are predicted over comparable unitary equipment. This also results in greater control of the building's interior temperature by the building's occupants. VRFs come in two system formats, two pipe and three pipe systems. In a heat pump two pipe system all of the zones must either be all in cooling or all in heating. Heat Recovery (HR) systems have the ability to simultaneously heat certain zones while cooling others; this is usually done through a three pipe design, with the exception of Mitsubishi and Carrier, whose systems are able to do this with a two pipe system using a branch circuit (BC) controller to the individual indoor evaporator zones. In this case the heat extracted from zones requiring cooling is put to use in the zones requiring heating. This is made possible because the heating unit is functioning as a condenser, providing sub-cooled liquid back into the line that is being used for cooling. While the heat recovery system has a greater initial cost, it allows for better zoned thermal control of a building and overall greater efficiencies.Goetzler (April 2007). \\"Variable Refrigerant Flow Systems\\". ASHRAE Journal: 24‚Äì31. In heat recovery VRF systems, some of the indoor units may be in cooling mode while others are in heating mode, reducing energy consumption. If the coefficient of performance in cooling mode of a system is 3, and the coefficient of performance in heating mode is 4, then heat recovery performance can reach more than 7. While it is unlikely that this balance of cooling and heating demand will happen often throughout the year, energy efficiency can be greatly improved when the scenario occurs.Rostamabadi, Mehrdad (2017). VRF HVAC Systems. Shafaf. VRF systems may be air or water cooled. If air cooled, VRF condensing units are exposed to outside air and may be outdoors, and condensing units are the size of large refrigerators, since they need to contain a large condenser (heat exchanger) to transfer heat to the surrounding air, because air doesn't have a high heat capacity. If water cooled, the condensing units are placed indoors and are much smaller and cooled, using water, possibly by a cooling tower. Japan VRF systems have been used in Japan since the 1980s. By 2007, in Japan, VRFs are used in 50% of midsize office buildings (up to 70,000 ft2 or 6,500 m2) and 33% of large commercial buildings (more than 70,000 ft2 or 6,500 m2). Daikin, a Japanese company, is the inventor of variable refrigerant volume systems (or VRV by Daikin air conditioning, other manufacturers remarketed this as VRF as VRV is a trademark). Home automation integration Today, there are dedicated gateways that connect VRFs with Home Automation and BMS (Building Management Systems) controllers for centralized control and monitoring. In addition, such gateway solutions are capable of providing remote control operation of all HVAC indoor units over the internet incorporating a simple and friendly user interface.

Products commercialised included tires, car batteries, cables, clothing, electronics, bedding, condoms. Facing financial difficulties, it rapidly spun off and sold its non-core assets before renaming itself Ansell in 2002. In 2006, it sold its tyre making business to Goodyear to focus on the manufacturing of latex products.  History  Pacific Dunlop has its roots in the Irish Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company, which established the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company of Australasia in 1893, which included a local finishing factory and office in Melbourne to supply the market with bicycle tyres. In 1899 downturn in cycling's popularity and speculation from the parent company led to the sell-off of Dunlop's Australasian and North American operations, and the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company of Australasia was floated with 80,000 shares, costing ¬£1 per share. The company was listed on Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide stock exchanges. In 1906, the company changed its name to the Dunlop Rubber Company of Australasia. World War One and the rise of the automobile proved to be a boom in demand for rubber products, and the company grew. In 1920, the company was incorporated in Victoria and Dunlop continued to expand merging with the Perdriau Rubber Company, a manufacturer of raincoats and boots in 1929, again renaming itself Dunlop Perdriau. In 1941, it again changed its name to Dunlop Rubber Australia. in 1969, Dunlop acquired Ansell Rubber, a disposable glove and condom manufacturer, and continued to expand. Establishing operations producing footwear, bedding and clothes. During the 1970s, the company streamlined its rapidly growing operations and profits soared. In 1980, Dunlop merged with Olympic Industries, another manufacturer of tyres and cables, and owner of the Beaurepaires automotive service chain. The company was also renamed Dunlop Olympic. By 1984, the Dunlop Olympic severed all ties with Dunlop UK. In 1986, Dunlop Olympic changed its name to \\"Pacific Dunlop\\", to reflect its region-wide status. The company was listed on the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges. Pacific Dunlop and Goodyear formed a joint venture that consolidated both companies tyre manufacturing operations in the Asia Pacific region named South Pacific Tyres, or SPT. SPT made tyres featuring the Dunlop, Goodyear and Olympic brands. During the 1980s, the company continued to expand, acquiring Nucleus Limited and buying assets from the failing Adelaide Steamship Company, notably Petersville Sleigh, owners of Peters Ice Cream, Birds Eye and Edgell.

Early life He was born in Vnorovy, Habsburg Monarchy, at the beginning of the 17th century. He had a brother, Strahinja.  Great Turkish War   Background  During the Great Turkish War Serbs gave big support to Austrian side. The Ottoman Empire had suffered partial military collapse against the Austrians in the 1680s, most notably at the Battle of Vienna in 1683, and the loss of Belgrade to Maximilian II of Bavaria in 1688 and Bosnia in 1689. However, with the beginning of the Nine Years War in the west, the early 1690s were to see an end to Habsburg conquests in the Balkans and a partial Ottoman recovery.McKay & Scott. The Rise of the Great Powers 1648‚Äì1815, p.75 Despite the Ottoman recovery and weakening of the Habsburg military presence on the Danube (most Habsburg soldiers were sent to fight against the France in the War of the Grand Alliance) Habsburg supreme command planned offensive activities against Ottomans, heavily relying on the Serb soldiers of Serbian Militia and Serbian rebels on the Balkans. In 1689 Louis William was appointed as chief commander of the Imperial army in its invasion of Serbia. Before the invasion Louis William recruited Serb rebels all over Serbia, whose infantry units were called hayduks while cavalry units of Serb rebels were called Serb hussars.  Invasion of Serbia (1689‚Äî1690)  On September 24, 1689, the Austrian army captured Ni≈° after defeating the Ottomans at the Battle of Ni≈°. Following the plan of their supreme command, Austrian army was then split on two parts. One part under command of Louis William headed toward Vidin, while remaining part of 3,700 soldiers under command of general Piccolomini went from Ni≈° via Prokuplje to Kosovo Vilayet in the middle of October 1689. Major part of his soldiers were members of Serbian Militia under command of Antonije Znoriƒá. Ottoman forces defeated Habsburg army in the region of Dragoman on October 29 and headed toward Prizren. The whole Habsburg garrison, consisting of Piccolomini's regiment and 2,500 Serbs of Serbian Militia under the command of Antonije Znoriƒá, retreated before the Ottoman troops reached Prizren. Znoriƒá and his Serbian Militia first retreated to Belgrade and then came back to Ni≈° following Piccolini's order. During his retreat Znoriƒá burned down Prokuplje. On January 23, 1690 Znoriƒá won the battle against the Ottoman unit of around 3,000 men, and on March 15 he attacked Peƒá. After he returned from Peƒá to Ni≈°ka Banja Znoriƒá won the battle against Ottoman units in Pernik near Sofia on March 20, and returned to Pirot with spoils of war.  Banat (1690‚Äî1695)  After Austrian troops retreated from Serbia to Banat in 1690, Znoriƒá was appointed for the commander of Caransebe≈ü which became his place of residence, with Serbian Militia still under his direct command. Friedrich von Veterani recommended Znoriƒá for promotion and salary increase on August 28, 1691. At the beginning of September 1691 Znoriƒá won the battle against an Ottoman company in the area of Danube's Iron Gate and another one in the area of Caransebe≈ü in November 1691. In spring 1694 Serbs were successfully mobilized and cavalry unit of 2,000 Serbs was put under the command of Antonije Znoriƒá who was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel (Oberstleutnant) on May 11, 1694. At the beginning of July 1694 Znoriƒá and his unit invaded territory of the Ottoman Empire (today part of Serbia) and destroyed a bridge on the river Morava, robbed five Ottoman ships which sailed on Danube loaded with army supplies and sank two Ottoman ships. Austrian War Council sent instructions to Znoriƒá for his further combat activities on July 31, and he complained that he had only 1,000 soldiers left after some of his men deserted him because they have not received their salaries. After Znoriƒá's complaint War Council paid overdue salaries to Serb soldiers. Znoriƒá was killed in the battle against the Ottomans near Lugoj on September 21, 1695. He was commander of the units of Serbian Militia within Austrian army that day.

Rosalind Russell stars as a judge targeted by a newspaper tycoon unhappy with her decision in his divorce case. Mary Beth Hughes in the film trailer Plot When wealthy newspaper publisher Judson M. Blair (Edward Arnold) divorces his wife Adele (Mary Beth Hughes), Judge Cornelia C. Porter (Rosalind Russell) awards Adele alimony of $4000 a month for five years or until she remarries. After learning from his lawyer, Northcott (Thurston Hall), that Porter refuses to hear an appeal, the furious Blair tries using his influence with her boss, Judge Graham (Guy Kibbee), to have her transferred, but to no avail. Reporter Jeff Sherman (Walter Pidgeon), recently fired by Blair, offers a solution in exchange for a promotion, a raise, a bonus and an unlimited expense account. After trying to bargain, Blair gives in to all his demands. Sherman gets his manicurist girlfriend Dotty (Jean Rogers) to pretend to agree to marry him in a couple of months. He then sets out to romance the judge, intending to threaten her with an alienation of affection scandal to force her to reduce Blair's alimony burden. When Porter takes a two-month vacation, Sherman follows along. Having researched her interests, Sherman pretends to be a sculptor. To obtain an artist's studio in the fully booked resort town where Porter is staying, Sherman persuades real sculptor Alexander Raoul (Leon Belasco) that Blair has offered him a commission to decorate his building. Sherman then starts working on Porter. She makes it very plain that she considers him a nuisance, but after much effort, he is able to win her love. To his dismay, however, he finds that he has fallen for her as well. When Porter runs into Raoul at Sherman's \\"studio\\", she learns about the scheme before Sherman can confess, and has both Blair and Sherman arrested. At their trial, Sherman acts as his own lawyer and calls Porter to the witness stand, where he asks her to marry him. Under questioning (and under oath), she is forced to admit that she did love him at one point. Porter runs out in tears. When Sherman chases after her, he is knocked down. Believing he has been hurt, Porter rushes back to him, and they are reconciled. Meanwhile, Blair becomes irate when he discovers that after he got his ex-wife to agree to a lump sum settlement, she promptly married another wealthy magnate.

In some cases, officials have stated that ministers should refuse communion to such politicians per canon 915 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law; elsewhere, that the politicians should, on their own, refrain from receiving communion ad normam canon 916; and in other cases, excommunication has been suggested. United States General statements In 2004, there was discussion of whether communion should be refused to American Catholic politicians who voted against laws banning abortion. With a few American bishops in favor of withholding communion from politicians and the majority against, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops decided that such matters should be decided on a case-by-case basis by the individual bishops. In 2005, Archbishop Donald Wuerl of Pittsburgh said no individual bishop should on his own deny communion to politicians because of \\"national ramifications\\", and suggested that such an action should be taken only on the basis of a two-thirds majority of all of the bishops or as mandated by the Vatican, while bishops Thomas Olmsted of Phoenix and Charles J. Chaput of Denver stated they would act on their own initiative and apply the sanctions put forward by a 2004 USCCB document entitled \\"Catholics in Political Life\\", though only, Chaput declared, in \\"extraordinary cases of public scandal\\". In 2008, Raymond Burke, former archbishop of St. Louis and assigned in that year to the Vatican, said communion should not be given to such politicians, arguing that support for abortion rights is a mortal sin that makes a person unfit for communion, and denial of communion would prevent other Catholics from thinking, because they see that pro-abortion rights politicians can receive communion, that being pro-abortion rights is an acceptable political position. A minority of American bishops support denying communion to pro-abortion rights Catholic legislators, interpreting canon 915 as justifying such action.Michael Sean Winters, \\"Chaput Cites Disunity Among Bishops on Canon 915\\" in National Catholic Reporter, 12 April 2011 In 2009, Wuerl argued that communion was not intended to be used as a weapon and that a pastoral approach would be more effective for changing minds than a canonical one. These statements of intent from church authorities have sometimes led American Catholic voters to vote for candidates who wish to ban abortion, rather than pro-abortion rights candidates who support other Catholic Church positions on issues such as war, health care, immigration, or lowering the abortion rate. Penalties of this kind from bishops have generally targeted Democrats, possibly because pro- abortion rights Catholic Democrats are more vocal in their support for abortion rights than the few pro-abortion rights Catholic Republicans. Proposals to deny communion to pro-abortion rights politicians are more common in the United States. Suggested reasons for this are a politicization of pastoral practice and abortion's constitutional status as a right.\\"The Word from Rome\\", John L. Allen, Jr. in National Catholic Reporter, 28 May 2004 While there was thus disagreement among the bishops about the opportuneness of refusing the Eucharist to Catholic politicians promoting legalization of abortion, there was unanimity regarding the moral obligation of Catholic politicians who participate in what their Church considers a seriously sinful action to refrain from going to Communion, an obligation stated on several occasions.Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark, \\"The Obligations of Catholics and the Rights of Unborn Children\\" Code of Canon Law, canon 916 Incidents The first instance of a pro-abortion rights politician being censured via denial of communion was in 1989. During a special election for the California Senate, Pro-abortion rights Catholic Lucy Killea was barred from communion by Leo Thomas Maher, then bishop of San Diego. She received communion in Sacramento with the consent of Bishop Francis Quinn. The incident brought publicity to Killea's candidacy and gained her the voters' sympathy, helping her to win the election. In 1984, Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor, then archbishop of New York, considered excommunicating New York Governor Mario Cuomo. He also condemned Cuomo's statements that support for abortion rights did not contradict Catholic teaching, but did not suggest that Cuomo should stop receiving communion.Mike Dorning, \\"Catholic politicians feel church heat on abortion\\" in Chicago Tribune, 26 April 2003 In January 2003, Bishop William Weigand of Sacramento said Governor of California Gray Davis, a Catholic who supported abortion rights, should stop receiving communion. In 2004, then- Archbishop Burke said he would not give communion to 2004 presidential candidate and Senator John Kerry, in part because of his position on abortion. According to religion experts, such a denial of communion would have been unprecedented. Kerry's own Archbishop Sean O'Malley refused to specify the applicability of his earlier statement that such Catholics are in a state of grave sin and cannot properly receive communion. The issue led to comparisons between Kerry's presidential campaign and that of John F. Kennedy in 1960. While Kennedy had to demonstrate his independence from the Roman Catholic Church due to public fear that a Catholic president would make decisions based on the Holy See agenda, it seemed that Kerry, in contrast, had to show obedience to Catholic authorities in order to win votes. According to Margaret Ross Sammons, Kerry's campaign was sufficiently damaged by the threat to withhold communion that it may have cost him the election. Sammons argues that President George W. Bush was able to win 53% of the Catholic vote because he appealed to \\"traditional\\" Catholics. In February 2007, as emerged two and a half years later, Bishop Thomas Tobin asked Representative Patrick Kennedy not to take communion because of his position on abortion. Kennedy told the Providence Journal that Tobin also instructed priests in the diocese not to give him communion; Tobin denied this. In 2007, Burke said that he would deny communion to 2008 Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani because of his views on abortion, and that Giuliani should not seek the sacrament. In May 2008, Kansas City Archbishop Joseph Naumann said that Kathleen Sebelius should stop receiving communion because of her support for abortion rights, and that she should not again take it unless she publicly stated that she opposed abortion rights. After Joe Biden was nominated as a vice presidential candidate in the 2008 presidential election, Bishop Joseph Francis Martino of Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, said Biden would be refused communion in that diocese because of his support for abortion. Biden was not refused communion in his then-parish of Wilmington, Delaware. In October 2019, Biden was reportedly refused communion at a church in Florence, South Carolina. Europe In Europe, Catholic bishops have less often raised the question of refusing communion to pro-abortion rights Catholic legislators: there \\"rigorous principles coexist with more flexible pastoral customs\\". In January 2001, Pope John Paul II gave Communion to Mayor of Rome Francesco Rutelli, whose position is that of being \\"personally opposed to abortion, but not willing to impose his stance through law\\". Similar cases are found among parliamentarians in Austria, Belgium and Germany. When the Spanish Parliament voted to liberalize that country's abortion laws in 2010, the Bishops Conference declared that the parliamentarians who chose to vote for the new law were not excommunicated, but that they \\"seriously separated themselves from the church and should not receive Communion.\\" King Juan Carlos, who was constitutionally required to sign the law, did not fall under any church sanctions. During parliamentary debate over changing Ireland's abortion laws, bishops in that country expressed positions both for and against denying communion to, or excommunicating, legislators who support changes to the law. Eamon Martin, successor to the archbishopric of Armagh, said that pro-abortion rights politicians should not seek communion and were excommunicated. Diarmuid Martin, archbishop of Dublin, was asked for comment on Martin's statements, and responded that communion should not be a site of debate or used for publicity reasons. Cardinal Se√°n Brady remarked that, among the bishops, \\"there would be a great reluctance to politicize the Eucharist\\". Holy See Recent popes have presided over Masses at which pro-abortion rights politicians have been given communion on many occasions. Pope John Paul II gave communion to Tony Blair and Cherie Blair, as well as to Rome Mayor Francesco Rutelli.https://www.osv.com/OSVNewsweekly/Article/TabId/535/ArtMID/13567/ArticleID/8377/Return- of-the-Communion-Wars.aspx At a Mass in St. Patrick's Cathedral in 2008 celebrated by Pope Benedict XVI, pro-abortion Catholic politicians Nancy Pelosi, John Kerry, and Rudy Giuliani received the sacrament.https://www.ncronline.org/news/no-hard-line-pope-communion-pro- choice-pols-0 Italian politician Nichi Vendola has also taken the Eucharist at a Mass celebrated by Benedict.https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/catholic- communist-and-gay-1.309190 Mexico In May 2007, Pope Benedict XVI expressed support for the Mexican bishops' envisaged excommunication of politicians who had voted to legalize abortion in Mexico City. Responding to a journalist's question, \\"Do you agree with the excommunications given to legislators in Mexico City on the question?\\" the Pope said, \\"Yes. The excommunication was not something arbitrary. It is part of the (canon law) code. It is based simply on the principle that the killing of an innocent human child is incompatible with going in Communion with the body of Christ. Thus, they (the bishops) didn't do anything new or anything surprising. Or arbitrary.\\" According to Der Spiegel, many journalists were wondering if that support could be interpreted as a wish to excommunicate such politicians.Der Spiegel. Pope Attacks Mexico City Politicians. May 10, 2007. Time magazine reported that it was in fact such a declaration. However, church officials said that it was not a declaration but appeared to be a misunderstanding. Federico Lombardi, director of the Holy See Press Office, clarified that the Pope was not excommunicating anyone since the Mexican bishops had not in fact declared an excommunication. However, Lombardi said that \\"politicians who vote in favor of abortion should not receive the sacrament of Holy Communion\\" because their action is \\"incompatible with participation in the Eucharist.\\" Uruguay In 2012, various news outlets reported that all of the Catholic legislators who supported the decriminalization of abortion in Uruguay had been excommunicated by the country's conference of bishops. That was the result of a misunderstanding and the secretary-general of the conference of bishops later said that the penalty of automatic excommunication applies to those who are directly involved in an abortion, \\"which does not include those who vote for a law that allows it.\\" References Abortion Eucharist in the Catholic Church Politicians ","title":"Eucharist denial to Catholic politicians over abortion"},{"id":"34129988","text":"The 1908‚Äì09 season was the 17th in the history of the Western Football League.

The Moscow Exchange Group also operates Russia's central securities depository (National Settlement Depository) and the country's largest clearing service provider (National Clearing Centre). The exchange is a result of December 2011 merger of the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange (MICEX) and the Russian Trading System. In April 2018, Moscow Exchange signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Shanghai Gold Exchange. History Moscow Exchange was established on 19 December 2011 by merging the two largest Moscow-based exchanges, the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange (MICEX) and the Russian Trading System (RTS), hence the name \\"Moscow Exchange MICEX-RTS\\". Both organisations had been formed in the 1990s and were the leading Russian exchanges for two decades with their MICEX Index and the RTS Index. The merger created a single entity and advanced Russia's plans to turn Moscow into an international financial centre. The exchange rebranded in July 2012. The exchange completed its initial public offering (IPO) on 15 February 2013, raising 15 billion rubles (approximately $500 million). The IPO, at the time the largest ever held exclusively in Moscow, was more than twice oversubscribed and drew demand from institutional investors globally. The Exchange's shares were included in the MSCI Russia Index as of 26 November 2013. In July 2014 the Central Bank of Russia, the largest shareholder of the exchange, completed the public sale of shares representing nearly 12% of the exchange. A Russian federal law requires the Central Bank to fully sell its stake in the exchange by 1 January 2016. In October 2018, Moscow Exchange launched the trading of deliverable gold futures on its Derivatives Market. Gold are delivered through precious metals market spot section.

As a result of regulatory changes, the international central securities depositories Euroclear and Clearstream now offer settlement services for Russian stocks and bonds. In addition to attracting international investors to trade on its platform, Moscow Exchange is focused on further developing the domestic investor base. Recent changes to the regulation of pension funds, together with changes to the listing rules, allow more assets of non-state pension funds to be invested into the market. Other legislative changes incentivise retail investors through reduced taxation to invest into stocks and bonds. Foreign Exchange and Money market Moscow Exchange's FX and Money Market is a key element of the Russian financial system. The Bank of Russia uses the Exchange's infrastructure to implement monetary policy and provide liquidity to the market through repo transactions and FX swap transactions.

It is no longer open to vehicular traffic. The bridge was constructed in 1867 and is one of thirteen remaining in the state. The lack of siding under the eaves creates a clerestory effect along the entire length. Around 1914, Louis Bower reinforced the Burr truss structure by adding an arch on either side, requiring the addition of skew backs where the arch meets the abutments. A number of reasons have been offered to explain the construction of covered bridges in Kentucky during the 19th century. The protection the cover provided against wood deterioration was likely most important. The cover allowed timbered trusses and braces to season properly and kept water out of the joints, prolonging the life by seven to eight times that of an uncovered bridge. Numerous dates have been listed over several decades for the construction of the Cabin Creek Bridge. Fiscal Court records quoted by Rev. O. G Ragan in his History of Lewis County, Kentucky. Press of Jennings and Graham, 1912, list 1869 as the date of charter of the Cabin Creek Turnpike; 1870 as the date in which the turnpike company was authorized to cross Cabin Creek \\"at William Henderson's;\\" and 1871 as the date of construction of the bridge. The circa 1914 Bower reconstruction has been confirmed through announcement in the Maysville Evening Bulletin to have begun in September, 1907. The builder of the Cabin Creek Bridge was generally and officially stated as unknown for decades. In recent years it has been attributed to both Jacob Bower and to William Henderson - then owner of adjacent property. The assertion that Henderson constructed the bridge is based upon a letter written in the 1970s to the Vanceburg newspaper disputing a statement made in an article that the bridge was constructed by Mackey Hughes. The author of the letter was Ms. Birdie Henderson, great great granddaughter of William Henderson.It has been handed down through several generations of the Henderson family that Mr. Henderson was the builder of the bridge. From Fiscal Court records transcribed in Ragan, the builder of the bridge was \\"a Mr. Bryant of Ohio.\\" \\"Mr. Bryant\\" was in all likelihood Josiah Bryant, a noted covered bridge builder from Mt. Orab, Brown County, Ohio. The structural and empirical details of several Ohio covered bridges confirmed to have been built by Bryant validate this contemporaneous documentation. Cabin Creek is NOT a Burr truss. The definition of it and several other bridges as a \\"Burr truss\\" was proposed by Vernon White in a paper he wrote titled \\"A Treatise on the Burr Family of Trusses.\\" Vernon had determined that the \\"multiple kingpost\\" truss was an unarched variation of the Burr and this information has been used frequently to describe these trusses in Kentucky. Vernon was a sociologist and had no formal training in structure. His treatise is generally accepted as flawed and not well researched. The specific improvement that Burr advanced in bridge design was to place the roadway BETWEEN the arches as opposed over them. As the triangle is the most sturdy structure in engineering, use of the simple multiple kingpost was sensible in stiffening the arch. Cabin Creek was closed to vehicular traffic in 1983 and was restored by Arnold M. Graton Associates of Ashland, New Hampshire, 2012‚Äì2014.

He has a cut fastball around 87, which has drawn praise for its late, darting movement into right-handed hitters and away from lefties. Since 2014, he has re-added a changeup in the 83 mph range that he throws almost exclusively to right-handed hitters. He will also mix in a slider (83‚Äì85) on occasion.

He is currently the offensive coordinator at the University of Oregon. He was previously the head coach at Mississippi State University from 2018‚Äì2019. Prior to entering coaching, Moorhead played as a quarterback at Fordham University from 1992‚Äì1995 and professionally for the Munich Cowboys of the German Football League in 1996. Coaching career Early years After a short professional playing career, the Pittsburgh-born Moorhead began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at the University of Pittsburgh. He was hired as running backs coach at Georgetown University in 2000, eventually being elevated to quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator by 2003. In 2004, Moorhead began a five-year stint at the University of Akron, including two years as the offensive coordinator. Moorhead joined the University of Connecticut staff in 2009 as offensive coordinator. The Huskies won a Big East Championship in 2010 and made an appearance in the Fiesta Bowl. Fordham Moorhead was named the head football coach at Fordham University on December 16, 2011. He is believed to be the first former Patriot League player to return to the conference as a head coach. Inheriting a 1‚Äì10 team, the Rams had the second largest turnaround in FCS in 2012 (6‚Äì5). The Rams opened the 2013 season with ten consecutive wins, the best start in Fordham's history. Penn State On December 12, 2015, Moorhead was named the offensive coordinator for the Penn State football team. During James Franklin's first two years as head coach (and prior to Moorhead's arrival), the Penn State offense averaged 335.3 yards per game in 2014 and 348.4 yards per game in 2015. Under Moorhead's offensive system during the 2016 season, offensive output at Penn State improved to 432.6 yards per game. On August 24, 2017, Moorhead was named the No. 1 rising assistant in college football by Sports Illustrated and Yahoo. Mississippi State On November 28, 2017, Moorhead was hired as the head coach at Mississippi State University, replacing Dan Mullen who had been with Mississippi State for nine seasons before being hired by the University of Florida. Moorhead led the Bulldogs to an 8-4 record in 2018, tied for the most wins for a first-year coach in school history. However, his second season got off to a rough start when it emerged that 10 players allowed a tutor to take tests and complete coursework for them. The players were all suspended for eight games, severely limiting the Bulldogs' depth. Fans were also angered by a pedestrian offense and upsets by Kansas State and Tennessee. There was also concern that he didn't really fit in with Mississippi State's culture, even though he'd taken the podium ringing a cowbell when he was formally introduced as head coach.Joe Moorhead's first press conference as head coach from Mississippi State athletics According to ESPN, Mississippi State officials intended to fire Moorhead if he didn't defeat Ole Miss in the 2019 Egg Bowl. However, the Bulldogs won that game 21-20 to become bowl-eligible, making Moorhead only the third Bulldog coach to win his first two Egg Bowls. At an emotional press conference the following day, Moorhead tried to knock down the rumors about his job security, saying, \\"This is my school, this is my team, this is my program,\\" and that anyone who thought otherwise could \\"pound sand and kick rocks.\\" He added, \\"You'll have to drag my Yankee ass out of here.\\"[ However, on January 3, 2020, Moorhead was fired after finishing 6‚Äì7 following a 38‚Äì28 loss to Louisville in the Music City Bowl. Besides the Bulldogs' lackluster performance in that game, athletic director John Cohen and other school officials were angered when they learned quarterback Garrett Shrader had suffered an eye injury during a fight in practice. Shrader had missed the game with what Moorhead initially described as an \\"upper body injury.\\" Oregon After his firing from Mississippi State, Moorhead was named the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at the University of Oregon on January 21, 2020.

Thompson, is a heuristic for choosing actions that addresses the exploration-exploitation dilemma in the multi-armed bandit problem. It consists of choosing the action that maximizes the expected reward with respect to a randomly drawn belief.  Description  Consider a set of contexts \\\\mathcal{X}, a set of actions \\\\mathcal{A}, and rewards in \\\\mathbb{R}. In each round, the player obtains a context x \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}, plays an action a \\\\in \\\\mathcal{A} and receives a reward r \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} following a distribution that depends on the context and the issued action. The aim of the player is to play actions such as to maximize the cumulative rewards. The elements of Thompson sampling are as follows: # a likelihood function P(r\\\\theta,a,x); # a set \\\\Theta of parameters \\\\theta of the distribution of r; # a prior distribution P(\\\\theta) on these parameters; # past observations triplets \\\\mathcal{D} = \\\\\\\\{(x; a; r)\\\\\\\\}; # a posterior distribution P(\\\\theta\\\\mathcal{D}) \\\\propto P(\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\theta)P(\\\\theta), where P(\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\theta) is the likelihood function. Thompson sampling consists in playing the action a^\\\\ast \\\\in \\\\mathcal{A} according to the probability that it maximizes the expected reward, i.e. action a^\\\\ast is chosen with probability :\\\\int \\\\mathbb{I} \\\\left[ \\\\mathbb{E}(ra^\\\\ast,x,\\\\theta) = \\\\max_{a'} \\\\mathbb{E}(ra',x,\\\\theta) \\\\right] P(\\\\theta\\\\mathcal{D}) d\\\\theta, where \\\\mathbb{I} is the indicator function. In practice, the rule is implemented by sampling, in each round, parameters \\\\theta^\\\\ast from the posterior P(\\\\theta\\\\mathcal{D}), and choosing the action a^\\\\ast that maximizes \\\\mathbb{E}[r\\\\theta^\\\\ast,a^\\\\ast,x], i.e. the expected reward given the sampled parameters, the action and the current context. Conceptually, this means that the player instantiates their beliefs randomly in each round according to the posterior distribution, and then acts optimally according to them. In most practical applications, it is computationally onerous to maintain and sample from a posterior distribution over models. As such, Thompson sampling is often used in conjunction with approximate sampling techniques.  History  Thompson sampling was originally described by Thompson in 1933. It was subsequently rediscovered numerous times independently in the context of multi-armed bandit problems. A first proof of convergence for the bandit case has been shown in 1997. The first application to Markov decision processes was in 2000. A related approach (see Bayesian control rule) was published in 2010. In 2010 it was also shown that Thompson sampling is instantaneously self- correcting. Asymptotic convergence results for contextual bandits were published in 2011. Nowadays, Thompson Sampling has been widely used in many online learning problems: Thompson sampling has also been applied to A/B testing in website design and online advertising; Thompson sampling has formed the basis for accelerated learning in decentralized decision making; a Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS) algorithm has been proposed for dueling bandits, a variant of traditional MAB, where feedbacks come in the format of pairwise comparison.  Relationship to other approaches   Probability matching  Probability matching is a decision strategy in which predictions of class membership are proportional to the class base rates. Thus, if in the training set positive examples are observed 60% of the time, and negative examples are observed 40% of the time, the observer using a probability-matching strategy will predict (for unlabeled examples) a class label of \\"positive\\" on 60% of instances, and a class label of \\"negative\\" on 40% of instances.  Bayesian control rule  A generalization of Thompson sampling to arbitrary dynamical environments and causal structures, known as Bayesian control rule, has been shown to be the optimal solution to the adaptive coding problem with actions and observations. In this formulation, an agent is conceptualized as a mixture over a set of behaviours. As the agent interacts with its environment, it learns the causal properties and adopts the behaviour that minimizes the relative entropy to the behaviour with the best prediction of the environment's behaviour. If these behaviours have been chosen according to the maximum expected utility principle, then the asymptotic behaviour of the Bayesian control rule matches the asymptotic behaviour of the perfectly rational agent. The setup is as follows. Let a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_T be the actions issued by an agent up to time T, and let o_1, o_2, \\\\ldots, o_T be the observations gathered by the agent up to time T. Then, the agent issues the action a_{T+1} with probability: :P(a_{T+1}\\\\hat{a}_{1:T}, o_{1:T}), where the \\"hat\\"-notation \\\\hat{a}_t denotes the fact that a_t is a causal intervention (see Causality), and not an ordinary observation. If the agent holds beliefs \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta over its behaviors, then the Bayesian control rule becomes :P(a_{T+1}\\\\hat{a}_{1:T}, o_{1:T}) = \\\\int_{\\\\Theta} P(a_{T+1}\\\\theta, \\\\hat{a}_{1:T}, o_{1:T}) P(\\\\theta\\\\hat{a}_{1:T}, o_{1:T}) \\\\, d\\\\theta, where P(\\\\theta\\\\hat{a}_{1:T}, o_{1:T}) is the posterior distribution over the parameter \\\\theta given actions a_{1:T} and observations o_{1:T}. In practice, the Bayesian control amounts to sampling, in each time step, a parameter \\\\theta^\\\\ast from the posterior distribution P(\\\\theta\\\\hat{a}_{1:T}, o_{1:T}), where the posterior distribution is computed using Bayes' rule by only considering the (causal) likelihoods of the observations o_1, o_2, \\\\ldots, o_T and ignoring the (causal) likelihoods of the actions a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_T, and then by sampling the action a^\\\\ast_{T+1} from the action distribution P(a_{T+1}\\\\theta^\\\\ast,\\\\hat{a}_{1:T},o_{1:T}).  Upper-Confidence-Bound (UCB) algorithms  Thompson sampling and upper-confidence bound algorithms share a fundamental property that underlies many of their theoretical guarantees. Roughly speaking, both algorithms allocate exploratory effort to actions that might be optimal and are in this sense \\"optimistic\\". Leveraging this property, one can translate regret bounds established for UCB algorithms to Bayesian regret bounds for Thompson sampling or unify regret analysis across both these algorithms and many classes of problems.

The band was formed in the mid-1960s, at a Boy Scout camp, when the members were only children (the youngest was six years old). Mama Djombo is the name of a spirit that many fighters appealed to for protection during Guinea-Bissau's War of Independence. In 1974, the politically conscious band leader Adriano Atchutchi joined. The group became immensely popular in the young country, which had gained its independence the same year. They would often play at President Lu√≠s Cabral's public speeches, and their concerts were broadcast live on radio. In 1978, the group traveled to Cuba and appeared on the eleventh youth music festival in Havana. Early in 1980, they went to Lisbon and recorded six hours of material. The first album Na camban√ßa was released the same year, and the song Pamparida, which was based on a children's song, became a huge hit throughout West Africa. In 1980 Cabral was overthrown, and the new regime under Jo√£o Bernardo Vieira no longer supported the band. They had fewer opportunities to perform, and broke up in 1986. However, the soundtrack to Flora Gomes' film Udju Azul di Yonta (The blue eyes of Yonta) (1993) was recorded by Adriano Atchutchi and other members of the original band under the name of Super Mama Djombo. In 2012, Super Mama Djombo toured Europe appearting at Afrika Festival Hertme. The band included several of the original members, drummer Z√© Manel, guitarist Miguelinho N'Simba, percussionist Armando Vaz Pereira and Djon Motta, together with new members such as solo guitarist Fernando Correia from the band Freaky Sound. Although Adriano Atchutchi, the original lead composer and bandleader, is not part of the current line up, the military coup in April resulted in him having to leave his post as a provincial governor when the military took over the functions of the government, so he was able to attend rehearsals to help the band prepare for the tour.

It is located in the town of Arendal. The church is the only church in the Trefoldighet parish, which is part of the Arendal Deanery in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark. The dean of the Arendal Deanery is based at this church. The red, brick, cruciform church is a basilica in the neo-Gothic style. The long church has short cross-arms but seats about 1,200 people. History There have been three churches in the town of Arendal, and all of them were called Trefoldighet 'Trinity Church'. Plans to build the present church building were adopted by the Arendal town council in 1883. The foundation stone was laid down on 7 August 1885, and on 29 June 1888 the church was consecrated. First church Drawing from c. 1800, Arendal with the first Trinity Church The first church was built of timber in an east‚Äìwest direction. The eastern section was divided into two wings, one was the altar and the king's chair, the other an organ. The pulpit was placed where the wings meet. The church was consecrated on 6 December 1670 and was dedicated to the Trinity. The church became too small and was demolished in 1832 to make room for the new church. Second church The town's second church was built in the Empire style in 1836 in the same location as the first church. This church was designed by Christian H. Grosch, was octagonal, and had 555 seats. The foundation stone was laid down in 1833 by Crown Prince Oscar (later, he became the king of Sweden and Norway). The church had no altar, but a large gypsum replica of Bertel Thorvaldsen's famous Christ sculpture. Today's church In 1880, when Arendal was at its height as a town based on shipping, it was decided to build a new, much larger church. An architectural competition was then announced to design the church. The competition was won by the 27-year-old architect Christian F√ºrst, who was a student of the German architect Johannes Otzen. The foundation stone was laid down on 7 August 1885 in a large ceremony. This Trinity Church is built of brick. The church has 1,200 seats and is the largest church in Aust-Agder county. The roof is covered with copper plates. The influence of Otzen is also seen in the use of materials, a brick stone type with smooth surface. The church has three church bells in addition to a carillon. The altarpiece scene is \\"Jesus blesses the eleven apostles before his ascension.\\" The altarpiece was painted by August Eiebakke. Location Trinity Church is located in a sloping terrain in the town of Arendal. To improve the church's surroundings, a bazaar was built around the church into the street shortly after the church was built. The church bazaar is a plaza surrounded by a brick wall with round arches. It is the only church bazaar in Norway that was designed and built simultaneously with the church.

It was first noted within the South Pacific Convergence Zone at the start of December 1992, as a shallow tropical depression in the vicinity of the island nation Tuvalu. Over the next few days the system gradually developed further as it affected Tuvalu, before it was declared to be a tropical cyclone and named Joni by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) during December 7. Over the next couple of days the system intensified further as it was steered south-westwards and posed a threat towards the Fijian dependency of Rotuma and the French territory of Wallis and Futuna. The system subsequently peaked as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale as it approached the Fijian Islands during December 10. Over the next couple of days the system moved through the Fijian Islands, before it became an extratropical cyclone during December 13. The system was last noted during the next day as it was absorbed by a mid-latitude trough of low pressure to the east of New Zealand. Joni caused gale to storm force winds on the Tuvuluan island of Niulakita and minor damage to most of the Tuvuluan islands. Total damages to crops in the island nation were estimated at (). There were no damages reported on the islands of Wallis and Futuna or Rotuma, while 1 person was killed, 10 people went missing and total damages were estimated at () in Fiji. The main impacts of Joni in Fiji were confined to the Western Division, with the islands of Yasawa, Mamanuca, Viti Levu, Kadavu and Vatulele being the worst affected areas. Damages in both Tuvalu and Fiji were exacerbated a month later by Severe Tropical Cyclones Nina and Kina interacting with each other. Due to the impact of this system, the name Joni was subsequently retired from the list of names for the region by the World Meteorological Organization. Meteorological history At the start of December 1992, a shallow tropical depression developed along the South Pacific Convergence Zone in the vicinity of Tuvalu. Over the next few days the system persisted near Tuvalu, before it started to move south-eastwards and develop further during December 5. During December 6, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 03P and initiated advisories, while the system was located on the 180th meridian about southeast of Funafuti, Tuvalu. Over the next couple of days, the system slowly deepened as it organised further and caused gale to storm force winds on the island of Niulakita and strong squally winds over the rest of Tuvalu. During December 7, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) reported that the depression had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it Joni. After it had been named the system passed near Niulakita as it was steered towards the southwest by a low to mid level flow and intensified further. The FMS classified Joni as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone during December 9, after an eye had become apparent in satellite imagery. The system subsequently slowed down and started to recurve and move southwards towards Fiji, due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge of high pressure. Early on December 10, the FMS reported that Joni had peaked as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone, with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 165 km/h (105 mph). The JTWC also reported at around this time that the system had peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 205 km/h (125 mph), which made it equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. During that day Joni passed near or over the Fijian island groups of Yasawa and Mamanuca, before it passed about to the west of the main Fijian island: Viti Levu. At around 10:30 UTC (22:30 FST) on December 10, the system was successfully located on the Nadi weather radar, while it was located about to the west- southwest of Nadi. Over the next few hours the system was located by radar, until it passed near or over the island of Vatulele. After passing near the island, the system moved south-eastwards towards Kadavu and Ono-i-Lau, with the eye of the system passing directly over Kadavu during December 11. The system subsequently started to weaken and transition into an extratropical cyclone, as it entered a region of strong vertical wind shear and cooler sea waters. The system was declared to be an extratropical cyclone early on December 13, before it was absorbed by a mid-latitude trough of low pressure to the east of New Zealand during December 14. Preparations and impact Severe Tropical Cyclone Joni impacted the island nations of Tuvalu and Fiji, while it also threatened the Fijian dependency of Rotuma and the French territory of Wallis and Futuna. The majority of the Tuvaluan islands suffered minor damage from Joni, while in Fiji the system caused a moderate to severe amount of damage. Due to the impact of this system, the name Joni was subsequently retired, from the list of names for the region by the World Meteorological Organization. This would normally mean that the name would not be used again in the region, however, the name remained on the list and was used during the 2008‚Äì09 season. During its developing stages, Joni was the first of two tropical cyclones to affect Tuvalu during the 1992‚Äì93 season. As the system started to affect the islands during December 5, the FMS issued a gale warning for Niulakita, while strong wind warnings were issued for the rest of the island nation. Joni subsequently passed near Niulakita during December 7, where it caused gale to storm force winds and minor damage to the islands. The system also caused some damage to crops which were valued at (). A tropical cyclone alert was issued for Wallis and Futuna during January 6, while a gale warning was issued for Rotuma during January 7. There was subsequently no damage reported in either the French Territory or the Fijian dependency. Between December 9‚Äì11, 1992, Joni became the first named tropical cyclone to directly impact the Fiji Islands since Severe Tropical Cyclone Sina of 1990. Joni caused a moderate to severe amount of damage to Viti Levu, with an overall damage total of about (). At various times between December 7 ‚Äì 11, the whole of the main Fijian islands were placed under either a gale, storm or hurricane-force wind warning by the FMS. Ahead of the system affecting Fiji, international and domestic flights to and from the Nadi International Airport were cancelled during December 9 and 10, while ships and small boats in Lautoka were moved to a nearby river. Hundreds of tourists on Fiji's offshore islands were evacuated to the mainland before the cyclone hit, while around 350 elected to ride out the system at island resorts. Other preparations included the erection of hurricane shutters, while people rushed to stock up on supplies with shelves cleared of emergency supplies. On some islands, villagers were evacuated to community centres, schools and churches at the height of the storm. Joni's impact on Fiji was generally confined to the Western Division, with the islands of Yasawa, Mamanuca, Viti Levu, Kadavu and Vatulele being the worst affected areas. The system caused high seas and widespread flooding including in several rivers on Viti Levu, which led to a substantial loss of livestock. In the immediate aftermath of the system a total of ten people were left missing, including a group of three fishermen in the Yasawa Islands. A group of three females on a fishing trip also went missing and were later found on an offshore island. A search party of four men went missing off Vanua Levu, while looking for the women, however, one swam ashore, while the other three were picked up by a cargo ship. Parts of Fiji's main cities of Suva, Nadi, and Lautoka were left without power, as falling trees brought down power lines. The Fijian Government reported that coconut plantations had been extensively damaged and that there was limited communications with the Western Division. Despite Joni's eye passing directly over Kadavu during December 11, the damage on the island was limited to wave induced coastal erosion, root crop damage and the loss of a few trees. The system passed near the wave rider station on the island, which recorded a peak wave height of about as Joni made its closest point of approach. During December 12, an army helicopter was deployed to conduct a damage survey of offshore islands. A total of six people were subsequently arrested in Suva and Nadi on December 14, in relation to a series of burglaries, committed during power blackouts caused by the cyclone. Joni's damage in both Tuvalu and Fiji was exacerbated a month later, by Severe Tropical Cyclones Nina and Kina interacting with each other.

Total losses from Kina are estimated to be near (). The system was first noted as a tropical depression, to the east of the Solomon Islands on December 23. Over the next few days the system moved south-eastwards and gradually developed further, before it was named Kina, after it had developed into a tropical cyclone during December 26. Meteorological history During the middle of December 1992, an active phase of the Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation combined with a low-level equatorial surge and an upper-level ridge of high pressure, to provide favourable conditions for the development of several circulations within the monsoon trough. During December 26, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) started to issue gale warnings on one of the circulation and classified it as a tropical depression, while it was located just to the east of the Solomon Islands. During that day, as the depression started to develop further, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 07P. At this time, the system appeared to be moving south-southeastwards, however, the FMS thought that the system posed a threat to Vanuatu and started to issue special weather bulletins for the island nation. The system continued to develop during December 27, before it was named Kina by the FMS, after it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. The system subsequently continued to develop as it moved south-eastwards away from Vanuatu and environmental conditions became more favourable with a warm spot appearing on satellite imagery during December 28. During December 29, the JTWC reported that Cyclone Kina had reached its peak intensity with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 220 km/h (140 mph), which made the system equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS. At around the same time TCWC Nadi also reported that the system had reached its initial peak intensity, with 10  minute sustained wind speeds of 150 km/h (90 mph) which made it a category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale. The system subsequently remained at its peak intensity until early on December 31, when it start to weaken and move eastwards towards the Yasawa island group. During the next day as the system approached the Northern Yasawa islands, Kina turned sharply towards the southeast, which made it pass between Fiji's two main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Preparations and impact Severe Tropical Cyclone Kina impacted the island nations of Fiji and Tonga, while it also threatened Vanuatu during its developing stages. Kina was one of the most destructive tropical cyclones to affect Fiji, with parts of the archipelago experiencing the full brunt of a cyclone, for the first time in twenty years. Fiji also suffered its second-greatest ever financial loss from a tropical cyclone, as a result of Kinas strange track through the island nation. The only cyclone to cause more damage in Fiji was Winston of February 2016. Due to the impact of this system, the name Kina was subsequently retired, from the list of names for the region by the World Meteorological Organization. The systems rain bands started to impact the island nation during December 28, and over the next few days produced torrential rainfall throughout the archipelago. Strong winds were observed in the islands during January 1 and gradually increased to hurricane force over the next few days, as the system passed virtually through the middle of Fiji. As a result, most parts of the archipelago suffered moderate to severe damage was recorded, while 23 people were killed in Fiji by Kina mostly as a result of drowning and being struck by flying objects. Tonga Late on January 2, the FMS issued a gale warning for the Tongan island groups of Ha ªapai, Tongatapu and Vava ªu, while the system was located about to the northwest of Nuku'alofa. During the next day as Kina moved more towards the south-southeast than had been expected, a hurricane warning was issued for Tongatapu, while a storm warning was issued for Ha ªapai. Later that day the cyclone subsequently passed about to the southwest of Nuku'alofa. The FMS subsequently downgraded the warnings to gale force as the system moved rapidly towards the south, before all warnings were cancelled early on January 4. Within the islands major damage was confined to the Tongatapu group where the system caused a moderate amount of damages, with severe damage reported to food crops while a minimal amount of damage was reported to dwellings. Within Nuku'alofa two people drowned, while another person was electrocuted. Wallis and Futuna In conjunction with Kina, Nina affected Wallis and Futuna between January 3‚Äì4, however, there were no tropical cyclone warnings were issued for the French Territory by the FMS. Kina affected Futuna during January 3, where sustained winds of up to and wind gusts of up to were recorded. Nina affected Wallis Island later that day where sustained winds of up to and wind gusts of up to were recorded. Within the islands some damage to crops and houses was reported. Tuvalu After Severe Tropical Cyclone Joni had affected Tuvalu during the previous month, Nina and Kina indirectly impacted the island nation during the opening days of January 1993. The systems contributed to the strength of the westerly winds that were already present over the islands, with winds of up to reported throughout the islands. As these winds combined with a heavy westerly swell and high seas, where they caused flooding of up to over the islands of Nanumea, Nanumaga, Niutao, Nui and Vaitupu. As a result, damage was reported to crops and several buildings in the island nation, including thirty houses. The two cyclones caused a severe amount of erosion in the island nation, with the shoreline on Vaitupu, receding by about . The Vaitupu Fisheries Harbour, that had only just been built during 1992, was seriously damaged by waves attributed to the two cyclones. On the island of Nanumea, a poorly designed sea wall trapped the storm surge on the island, which caused salt water contamination of the island vegetation and killed several trees. The An appeal for international assistance was subsequently made by the Government of Tuvalu, as supplied of food and other essentials like petrol and kerosene on the worst affected islands were running low. International assistance was subsequently provided, by the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs, who provided an emergency grant of . The European Commission also provided emergency aid to Tuvalu which enabled the Red Cross, to provide foodstuffs, shelter, medical supplies and utensils to people whose homes were destroyed.

The system was first noted as a tropical low over the Cape York Peninsula on December 21. Over the next few days the system moved south-westwards and moved into the Gulf of Carpentaria where it was named Nina, after it had developed into a tropical cyclone during December 23. The system was subsequently steered south- eastwards by an upper level trough of low pressure, before it made landfall as a Category 2 tropical cyclone on the Cape York Peninsula near Cape Keerweer during December 25. Over land the system weakened into a tropical low before it regenerated into a tropical cyclone over the Coral Sea during December 28. The system subsequently moved north-eastwards, under the influence of Severe Tropical Cyclone Kina and an upper level ridge of high pressure. During January 1, 1993, Nina peaked with sustained wind speeds of 140 km/h (85 mph), as it affected Rennell, Bellona and Temotu provinces in the Solomon Islands. The system subsequently gradually weakened as it accelerated eastwards and affected Rotuma, Wallis and Futuna, Tonga and Niue. Nina was subsequently absorbed by Kina, while both systems were located near the Southern Cook Islands during January 5. Meteorological history During the middle of December 1992, an active phase of the Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation took place which helped to reinforce atmospheric convection across Northern Australia and the western Pacific Ocean. A tropical low subsequently developed, within this area of atmospheric convection over the Cape York Peninsula, under the influence of the warm waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria during December 21. Over the next couple of days, the system moved south-westwards and moved into the Gulf of Carpentaria, where the upper level support was favourable for further development. During December 23, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology named the system: Nina, after it had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. During that day the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated advisories and designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 03P, while Nina started to be steered south-eastwards by an upper level trough of low pressure. Over the next day the system continued to intensify before both the JTWC and the BoM reported that Nina had peaked with winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) during December 25, which made it a category 2 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale. The system subsequently made landfall on the Cape York Peninsula during that day near Cape Keerweer, where it weakened into a tropical low and emerged into the Coral Sea during December 27. The system re-intensified into a tropical cyclone during December 28, as it moved north-eastwards, under the influence of Severe Tropical Cyclone Kina and an upper level ridge of high pressure. Over the next few days, the system continued to re-intensify as it moved north-eastwards, before both the JTWC and the BoM reported that Nina had peaked with winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). This made it a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale and equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. During January 1, Nina passed over Rennell Island at its peak intensity, as it moved into the South Pacific basin. Over the next few days, the system gradually weakened, as it accelerated eastwards through Temotu Province and around the eastern side of Kina. During January 3, Nina passed to the north of the Fijian dependency of Rotuma, before it passed in between the islands of Wallis and Futuna. During the next day the system weakened into a tropical low, as it turned south- eastwards and passed in between Tonga and Niue, before it was absorbed into Kina's circulation, while both systems were located near the Southern Cook Islands during January 5. Preparations and impact Severe Tropical Cyclone Nina impacted the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Cape York Peninsula, Niue, Rotuma, Tonga, Tuvalu, the Solomon Islands, Wallis and Futuna. Due to the impact of this system, the name Nina was subsequently retired, from the list of names for the Australian region by the World Meteorological Organization. Gulf of Carpentaria As Nina developed in the Gulf of Carpentaria, tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued, for parts of the Northern Territory and Queensland. These areas included Nhulunbuy in the Northern Territory, Mapoon, Aurukun and the Lockhart River in Queensland. The system subsequently moved eastwards and affected sparsely populated and uninhabited areas of the Cape York Peninsula, where torrential rainfall was recorded during December 25. As a result of Nina impacting Queensland, the State Disaster Coordination Centre in Brisbane operated around the clock, while SES units, local authorities and disaster district coordinators in the region were put on full alert. Ahead of the system affecting Port Stewart, ten members of a twenty-member fishing party were evacuated to safety while the other ten refused to be evacuated. As a result, they were left stranded at the port, by the swollen Stewart River and its flooded tributaries until a rescue helicopter rescued them. Within the Aurukun Aboriginal community and Pormpuraaw widespread damage to trees were reported, while four houses were damaged by flying tree branches. Solomon Islands After impacting Queensland, Nina impacted the Solomon Islands between December 30 and January 3, where it caused extensive damage to southern and eastern islands including Rennell and Bellona. Islanders were caught almost unprepared for Nina, because of preparations for the traditional New Year Celebrations. There were 3 people killed in the islands with an elderly woman killed on Bellona after she was trapped under a collapsed house while twins born at the height also died from lack of warm dry linen and shelter. The only buildings left standing were the Australian built Seventh Day Adventist churches in these islands. The Solomon Islands Government declared parts of Rennell and Bellona, Southern Guadalcanal, Temotu, Makira and Malaita Provinces disaster areas. The Government subsequently shipped and airlifted relief materials to the affected areas, including food supplies, medical supplies, tarpaulins and water. The Solomon Islands Red Cross also helped with the relief effort and dispatched 113 tarpaulins to four provinces to shelter the homeless, along with blankets, clothing and various household items. They used reserve funds in order to transport these supplies to the islands affected by canoe and plane. The Government of the Solomon Islands subsequently launched an appeal for international assistance, with food assistance, tapualins, tents, water containeds and chainsaws amongst the things asked for. A need also existed for helicopters and aircraft services, in order for field assessments to take place and the transportation of water engineers. Rotuma, Wallis and Futuna, Samoa and Tonga Ahead of the system affecting Rotuma, a storm force wind warning was issued for Rotuma, with sustained wind speeds of and wind gusts of up to were forecast to occur. However, the system only had a minimal effect on Rotuma, with a few rain showers and sustained winds of occurring for a brief period. In conjunction with Kina, Nina affected Wallis and Futuna between January 3‚Äì4, however, there were no tropical cyclone warnings were issued for the French Territory by the FMS. Kina affected the island of Futuna during January 3, where sustained winds of up to and wind gusts of up to were recorded. Nina affected Wallis Island later that day where sustained winds of up to and wind gusts of up to were recorded. Within the islands some damage to crops and houses was reported. Ahead of Nina affecting the Samoan Islands, residents living near the sea were warned to move inland, while ships were ordered to remain in port. The system subsequently passed to the south of the Samoan Islands during January 4, where it brought high winds and caused wind gusts of at Pago Pago in American Samoa. Some minor damage to roofs, bananas and breadfruit was reported, while total damages in American Samoa to both property and crops were estimated at between $ and $. Nina affected Northern Tonga during January 4, just after Kina had affected Tonga's southern islands with hurricane-force winds. Ahead of Nina affecting the islands, a gale warning was issued for the islands of Niuafo'ou and Keppel, where some damage to houses and crops were recorded. A gale warning was also issued for the island nation of Niue during January 4, where winds of up to caused damage to the island nations port. Tuvalu After Severe Tropical Cyclone Joni had affected Tuvalu during the previous month, Nina and Kina indirectly impacted the island nation during the opening days of January 1993.

The main idea behind the book is that women are not oppressed by men but rather control men to their advantage. A third edition of the book was released in January 2009. Synopsis The book argues that, contrary to common feminist and women's rights rhetoric, women in industrialized cultures are not oppressed, but rather exploit a well-established system of manipulating men. Vilar writes, \\"Men have been trained and conditioned by women, not unlike the way Pavlov conditioned his dogs, into becoming their slaves. As compensation for their labours men are given periodic use of a woman's vagina.\\" The book contends that young boys are encouraged to associate their masculinity with their ability to be sexually intimate with a woman, and that a woman can control a man by socially empowering herself to be the gate-keeper to his sense of masculinity. Vilar states that this has been going on for some time. The author says that social definitions and norms, such as the idea that women are weak, are constructed by women with their needs in mind. Vilar explains how it works: if women are viewed as weak, less is expected of them; and therefore they are given more leeway in society than men. Vilar states that women are generally \\"gold diggers\\" who attempt to extract money and other material resources from men. One means by which women control men to effect this transfer of resources is praise. Women dole out praise to men only when their needs are met in some way. Another means of manipulation is the calculated use of emotional displays. Vilar claims that women can control their emotional reactions whereas men cannot, and that women create overly-dramatized emotional reactions to get their way: they \\"blackmail\\" men emotionally. Women also use sex as a tool of manipulation and control but also traditional concepts of love and romance, which are seen more positively than sex, to control men's sexual lives. Vilar writes that men gain nothing from marriage and that women coerce them into it under the pretense that it fulfills their romantic desires. The book closes with Vilar stating that it would be difficult to change the situation by appealing to women, as women are unsympathetic to the plight of men, and unwilling to give up their comfortable position in society. It is up to men to see past the deception and emotional blackmail and subject it to open criticism before any meaningful changes can occur. Critical reception The Manipulated Man was quite popular at the time of its release, in part due to the considerable press coverage it received.E.

Swain (18 July 1834 - 25 December 1910) was a physician and missionary of the Methodist Episcopal Church. She has been called the \\"pioneer woman physician in India,\\" and as well as the \\"first fully accredited woman physician ever sent out by any missionary society into any part of the Non-Christian world\\". Her call to service in India fell from a need to have a female physician provide quality medical care to high-caste women, that were religiously secluded to zenana. Supported by the Women's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, Swain left the United States in 1869, for Bareilly, India, where she spent the next twenty-seven years of her life treating women and children from illnesses, while simultaneously working to evangelize natives. By the end of her first year in Bareilly, Swain had acquired seventeen medical students, clinically trained under her supervision, and had treated at minimum, 1,300 patients. Within the next four years, she helped establish the first hospital in India for women and children.  Early life and education  Swain was born in Elmira, New York and raised in Castile, New York. Her father, John Swain, was of Irish descent and her mother, Clarisa Seavey, carried New England ancestry. At age eight, Swain joined the Methodist Church, a decision that would influence her aspirations of assuming a \\"Christian profession\\". Following her religious studies, at age twenty-one, Swain began teaching private pupils in Castile and subsequently moved to Canandaigua, New York to formally teach at a school. There, she developed an interest in medicine by caring for the sick. Swain began her medical training at the Castile Sanatorium, under the direction of Dr. Cordelia A. Greene. Three years later, she applied and was accepted to the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, graduating in the spring of 1869.  Working in Bareilly  thumb Mrs. Thomas, the director of the girls' orphanage of the Methodist Mission in Bairelly, sent out a letter to Mrs. J.T. Gracey (a former missionary), requesting for a female physician to aid the village. Mrs. J.T. Gracey in turn, sent for Dr. Swain. Swain accepted the appeal and in November 3, 1869, she sailed from New York and arrived in Bairelly on January 20, 1870.  Medical training for native women  Upon arriving in Bareilly, Swain made it an imperative to train local women to help assist her with patients. Swain began with the fourteen native Christian women that Mrs. Thomas had previously been educating. Beginning March 1, 1870, these women were given clinical experience by working with the orphaned sick and \\"Christian village\\", and were taught basic lessons in \\"anatomy, physiology, and materia medica,\\" by Swain herself. They soon became \\"proficient in compounding and dispensing machines.\\" Swain had spent two to three hours a day with her students, preparing them for the \\"examination of fourth-grade doctors,\\" supervised under two civil surgeons and an American physician. Thirteen of her students passed the exam, and on April 10, 1873, they were bestowed \\"certificates for practice in all ordinary diseases.\\" Of these graduates, Swain chose three as \\"Bible women\\" to help promote the religious mission of the hospital. In the 1890s, the Christian Medical College Ludhiana was founded to provide formalized medical courses in lieu of the basic training that the assistants were previously offered. Furloughs Accommodating the constant influx of patients, outpatient visits, and the rapidly increasing work eventually took a toll on Swain's physical and mental health, causing her to return to America in March 1876. On September 25, 1879, Swain left the states, and arrived at Bombay, India on November 6. She was then appointed to resume her work, in January 1880. Her second return to America was triggered by a deterioration of health in both her sister and herself. She left Khetri, India in March 1888, and returned a year and a half later.  Clara Swain Hospital  In 1906 Although there had been indigenous resistance to Western medicine and religion in India, the mission had successfully procured an estate from the Nawab of Rampur, on which to expand medical facilities. Such was not an uncommon thread of families of princely states, since many of them in this area were in favor of \\"mission-sponsored initiatives for female education or medical work.\\" In allotting the gift, The Nawab of Rampur was quoted saying, \\"Take it! It is yours! I give it to you with great pleasure for such a purpose.\\" On January 1, 1872, Swain moved her team over to the Nawab's former property. By May 1873, a dispensary building was erected and by January 1, 1874, the first in-estatehouse patients were treated.

Asmussen was a pastor in Altona, Hamburg. He was removed from office by the Nazis because of his activity in the Reich Fraternal Council of the Confessing Church. He was jailed several times before 1945. He was co-author of the protest \\"Word and Affirmation of Altona Pastors amid the Misery and Confusion of Public Life\\" (11 January 1933), which rejected a pact with National Socialism and thus became a preliminary step toward the theological declaration of the Barmen Confessional Synod. From 1945 to 1948, Asmussen presided over the Evangelical Church Chancellery, and from 1949 to 1955, he was dean () in Kiel; he was a promoter of ecumenical dialogue. His writings include Seelsorge (Pastoral Care; 1934) and Der R√∂merbrief (Letter to the Romans; 1952).  Life  Early life Asmussen, the son of a headmaster, Jes Georg Asmussen, attended high school in Flensburg. His family came from a conservative, pious roots and was influenced greatly by Pastor Emil Wacker, a charismatic revival pastor. While in high school, he studied military combat in the tactics of the First World War until 1917. It was then his eldest brother was killed in the war, and he enlisted in the army. After serving until the war's end, he went on to study Protestant theology at the University of Kiel and University of T√ºbingen. While at Keil he, and a number of students, formed the ‚ÄúLeague of Lutheran Brethren‚Äù in opposition to the rising popularity of liberal theology. While at T√ºbingen the group was known as ‚Äúthe archconservatives from Flensburg‚Äù. He then, in 1921, became vicar and later curate at the Deaconess House in Flensburg. In 1925 he took a pastorate in Albersdorf (Dithmarschen), from where he later moved in 1932 to the pastorate of the Church of St. Trinitatis in Altona. While at Albers, he worked to reform the local church to bring in a greater portion of the populace. The conservative local populace found his views appealing, as they shared a mutual distaste in the Weimar Republic. The local populace was insistent in its refusal to fly the flag of the Weimar Republic, and thus Asmussen's choice to fly old Imperial flags gained him considerable rapport. Ecclesiastical resistance to Nazi Party After the Altona Bloody Sunday incident in July 17, 1932 where eighteen people were killed in street fighting between the Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS), the Prussian police, and Communist Party (KPD) Asmussen attempted to calm tempers by holding the funerals and stressing that vengeance was not the solution. However Hitler declared that the Nazi dead were ‚ÄúChristian martyrs‚Äù, released a pamphlet titled W√∂hrden‚Äôs Bloody Night and Its Consequence and used the incident to spark more demonstrations. Asmussen wrote letters to the Nazi party and Hitler himself first begging for them to end the violence, later denouncing their action. Asmussen was one of the main authors of a piece published on January 11, 1933 from Altona pastors stressing their concern with the affairs of Germany, which became known as the Altona Confession in the story. It denounced Hitler's use of the event for political gain and stated that the Church was not sided with the National Socialists, nor did it side with the Communists. It declared that no political party could claim to be ruled by the word of God. Its mission was also to bring both sides to peace and resolve their conflicts without violence. This declaration is considered a harbinger of the later and more famous Barmen Theological Declaration. Hitler soon rose to power and intended to consolidate the German clergy into a single Church that supported the Nazi party. He established the German Christians, a group of pro-Nazi clergy who had government backing. After the victory of the German Christians in the church elections of 1933 in the Schleswig-Holstein church, Asmussen, as its avowed opponent, was suspended and sent into early retirement in 1934. Asmussen moved to Berlin and took over leading functions in September 1933 of the Pastors out Confessing Church. He belonged to the Reich Fraternal Council, and along with Karl Barth and Thomas Broad, drafted the Barmen Declaration and presented it at the first Barmer Confessional Synod of 1934 as the introduction speech. In 1935 Asmussen founded, and was the director for, the Church University of Berlin-Dahlem which was opened on 1 November 1935 where he taught Practical Theology. However, in 1937 Heinrich Himmler decreed any training and tutelage of young theologians was prohibited for non-party clergy. Asmussen was a signatory of the Evangelical Church memorandum in the spring of 1936 and held a memorial service on 19 February 1937 at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp for the murdered chief legal advisor to the Provisional church leadership, Friedrich Weissler.Eberhard R√∂hm, J√∂rg Thierfelder: Juden, Christen, Deutsche. Band 2/I: 1935-1938. Entrechtet. Calwer, Stuttgart 1992, S. 184f., In 1939, a wide- ranging speech and sermon ban was imposed on Asmussen and other non-state clergy, who were on the lists of BK for the persecuted Christians.Eberhard R√∂hm, J√∂rg Thierfelder: Evangelische Kirche zwischen Kreuz und Hakenkreuz. Bilder und Texte einer Ausstellung. Calwer, Stuttgart 3. Aufl. 1983, S. 98ff., By 1941, Asmussen was a member of the faculty circle and the audit committee, the examinierte theological chaired by Martin Albertz candidates. In addition, he served as pastor in the Berlin parrish. In May 1941, Asmussen was arrested at Albertz, along with G√ºnther Dehn and vicar Elisabeth Gray and sentenced on 22 December 1941 by the Berlin Special Court I to imprisonment.Heinrich Vogel, G√ºnther Harder: Aufgabe und Weg der Kirchlichen Hochschule Berlin 1935-1955, Berlin 1956, S. 58-61 In 1943 Bishop Theophil Wurm brought him into the W√ºrttemberg church. Theological career after 1945 In 1945 he was elected as Chairman of the Council of the EKD brotherhood. When church leaders held a conference in Treysa (today Schwalm City) in August 1945, he represented the emerging Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) and was elected to head the church office, which he built at his home in Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd. After the surrender of Nazi Germany, he sought to publicly apologize on behalf of all Evangelical Christians for the complicity of much of the clergy to the Nazi regime. Drafted by Asmussen and Martin Niem√∂ller, a written apology was published on 19 October 1945 in Stuttgart by the Council of the EKD.Evangelisches Zentralarchiv in Berlin, 2/1790 The Declaration states in part: In the following years Asmussen fell increasingly out of favor with the EKD Council, because he called for a more autonomous role of Lutheranism within the EKD Council. He had become rather critical of the church policy of Karl Barth and Niem√∂ller and their desire to politicize the church, particularly with the Darmstadt edict of 1947. In 1948 he was relieved of his post as president of the church office and not re-elected on the Council of the EKD. From 1949 to 1955 he was a provost in Kiel. In the 1950s Asmussen, who had also become a member of the CDU, criticized the Church's stance against nuclear weapons; a widely held view among the church. Asmussen was highly critical of the Soviet Union believing its aspirations of spreading its influence or conquering the west would entail the deprivation of rights and freedoms of Germans and Christians. He therefore believed nuclear weapons might be needed to deter this and that it was not the place of the Church to denounce the NATO government's defense efforts.Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirchenzeitung 7/1958, S. 331.

Berlin 2009, S. 118-120; PDF-S. 126-128 Late life In the last decade of his life, he became increasingly involved in Ecumenism and progressively closer to the Roman Catholic Church. Asmussen died on 30 December 1968 and was buried in the Park Cemetery Eichhof in Kiel. Honors Asmussen received honorary doctorates from the universities of St. Andrews in 1939 and Kiel in 1949.

The group grew out of desperation and in reaction to the New York art market. The movement primarily involves visual arts, literature, film, art manifestos and graphic design. The Antagonist Art Movement articulates its anti-commercial politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in the art market and focuses its efforts on creating non-commercial cultural works and venues. Its purpose is to ridicule the meaninglessness, superficiality and artificiality of the commercial art world. The Antagonists foster emerging talent by providing opportunities for the exhibition of works, networking with other artists, mentoring and resources. The Antagonist Movement has worked with more than 3,500 artists from around the world over the past 14 years.  Overview  Antagonist activities have included public gatherings, demonstrations, the publication of art/literary journals, the production of documentary films, a clothing line, weekly art shows, writer's nights and a public access television show. For many of its members, the Movement is their protest against the established commercial art market in which there is little chance for unknown artists to succeed, regardless of how talented they may be. Based in Manhattan's Lower East Side, the Antagonist Movement also has participants in other US cities, Europe and South America. Influenced by punk rock, pop art and by the Dada movement, the Antagonist Movement seeks to be inclusive of all forms of art and individual artist‚Äôs styles and expressions as long as the work provokes.  History  Ethan Minsker, Sergio Vega, and Anders Olson first conceived of the Antagonist Movement while working in bars in the Lower East Side. They wanted to create an event that would also incorporate their individual passions: art, film, music and writing. The first art show was held in the basement of Niagara Bar in January 2000. It featured art by Minsker, Olson and Dima Drjuchin. The owners of the bar asked the group to do this pop-up art event every Thursday for one year. They would end up doing these one-night art shows for over 11 years, showcasing the works of more than 3,000 up-and-coming artists. The Antagonists added live performances to the events, such as Schocholautte, Lisa Jaeggi, Carla Rhodes, Champions of Sound, Dead on a Friday and Vic Ruggiero. Minsker used film to document the larger events of the group and events held in other US cities and abroad. In 2002, the Antagonists began a writer's night on Sunday nights at Black & White Bar, just a few blocks away. The actor and comedian Jonah Hill was discovered performing at one of these events. Past hosts of the writer's night have included Bryan Middleton, Richard Allen and Brother Mike Cohen. Minsker took the helm of the Antagonist Movement in 2003 when Vega and Olson began spending more time on other projects. Around this time, the group appointed its first art directors who would guide the artistic direction of the movement. Gabriel Coutu-Dumont and Anders Olson served in this capacity from 2000-2005. Ted Riederer was the artistic director from 2005 to the present. Riederer's other major projects include Never Records.  Events   Weekly events  = Ignite (2000‚Äì2011) = One night art shows on Thursdays. Three to six artists showed new works every Thursday at Niagara Bar on East 7th Street in New York City. The art was installed between 8 pm and 9 pm and stayed up until 2 am. The Antagonists took a small commission and the artists kept the rest. Money earned from the art sales, in turn, was used to fund Movement projects. However, most artists did not sell anything. The focus of the event was to build a community who could support and help each other. For many artists, it was their first public showing. Along with the art slams, there often was live music and/or performance art. The events were held in the basement of the bar until 2008 when the bar owners created a gallery space on the ground floor, at the back of the bar. The Thursday night art shows ended in the fall of 2011 after the Antagonists and the owners could not reach an agreement upon a different night to show. = Alphabet City Soup (2009‚Äì2011) = Live music on Monday nights. From punk rock to chiptunes, on any given Monday from 8 pm to 10 pm, free live shows were performed in the back of Niagara bar under the banner of the Antagonists. For the first year, the Monday night shows were hosted by the band Schocholautte, who also composed music for two Antagonist films, This Is Berlin, Not New York and The Dolls of Lisbon. In 2010, music bookings were taken over by Marissa Bea. Bea would also act as managing editor on much of the literature published by the Antagonist Movement. = Fahrenheit (2002-present) = Open mic Sundays. Writer's night is held at Black & White bar at 86 East 10th Street New York City. Originally, it was held every Sunday night but it has since been reduced to the first Sunday of every month. This event was created by the first host, Bryan Middleton. The rules are writers have five minutes, and no poetry. But the rules are constantly broken. In later years, a timer was added to keep the writers within their allotted time. To control noisy bar patrons during readings, the bartender keeps a two-sided sign. One side reads: \\"Please respect our writers and keep your voices down.\\" If that fails to work, the other side reads: \\"Now shut the F--- Up!\\" The writers range from a retired wrestler to published authors, and everyone in between. Linda Kleinbub and Jennifer Juneau began hosting Fahrenheit on 7 October 2018. The show continues to be on the first Sunday of the month with sign up at 6:30 and showtime from 7 to 10 pm.  One-off events  Over the years, the Antagonists have sponsored dozens of themed shows, often held in the front room of Niagara or on the streets of the Lower East Side. Theme shows have included \\"The Box Show\\", \\"The Photo Booth Show\\", \\"New York Underwater Show\\" and \\"Caffeinate and Decimate.\\" Under the guidelines the pieces had to be new and produced based on the theme. Themes are determined by a combination of curators, artists, and members of the Antagonist Movement. These shows ranged from 10 to 100 artists. The goal of these events was to bring together a diverse community of artists for networking and production opportunities. = Sketchbook Party (2009) = This event was a gathering of 30 artists. The warm-up consisted of passing around the artists‚Äô sketchbooks before competing in a battle for the best artist, judged by the audience. In the first round of competition, two artists faced off, drawing each other within three minutes. The winner moved on to round two, where the artists drew the artist facing him/her in addition someone standing next to the artist. In round three, artists drew the other artist, a person standing next to him/her and a prop. Because most artists work alone, this event brought a social and fun aspect to the artists‚Äô creativity. = Rat House Project (2010) = In the East Village, middle school kids were making bird houses as part of their school projects. The neighbors began complaining when they discovered that rats were getting into the bird houses and eating the bird food. Eleven artists made elaborate homes for rats, each less than two square feet. The rat houses were installed in a vacant lot on 14th Street in New York City and remained up for three weeks until many were stolen, and the owner of the lot had the rat houses removed. = Obscure Dictators = This was a two-month theme show of portraits of normal people depicted as dictators. Based on the theory that dictators are average people with access to power, any of us could be a dictator. Eleven artists took part, including Kevin Cyr, Catharine Lyons, Thomas Sarvello, Ted Riederer and Pete Petrine. This show was exhibited in the front room of Niagara bar and is featured in the Antagonist movie Mark of the Ninja.  Gallery Shows  From time to time, the Antagonist Movement holds group art shows in small commercial galleries to exhibit works of selected artists. = \\"Behold, the Antagonist,\\" Dead Cat Gallery, Providence Rhode Island (2008) = More than 20 New York based artists traveled to Providence to participate in a special exhibition. Curated by Ted Riederer, the artists‚Äô works were diverse and dynamic, including videos, sculptures, interactive, photography and paintings. The artists used the visit to Rhode Island to meet New England artists for an exchange of ideas, experiences and sociability. = Mindy Wyatt Gallery, New York, New York (2009) = Held in conjunction with the Royal Flush Festival, the Mindy Wyatt Gallery presented a curated group show of select artists of the Antagonist Art Movement. Exhibiting artists included Pat Conlon, Sylvia Ortiz, Jeffrey Beebe, Jeramy Fletcher, Ted Riederer, Anders Olson, Alex Passapera and Daniel York Krupin. = \\"Pop Up Lisboa,\\" Lisbon, Portugal (2010)= The Antagonist Art Movement combined the efforts of artists from all over the world to put together a doll show within the Pop Up Lisboa show. Blank dolls were sent to more than 60 artists worldwide, who painted, sewed, demolished, or otherwise marked up their doll, and returned it to New York City. The dolls were then brought to Lisbon and displayed. This was prominently featured in the film The Dolls of Lisbon. = \\"Weapon,\\" Fardom Gallery, Long Island City, NY (2012) = This show featured the art of Gavin Kenyon, Ethan H. Minsker, Ted Riederer, Shannon Daugherty and Jay Ivcevich. The fascination with weaponry has been a longstanding human trait. From man‚Äôs beginning, and one of the reasons for its distinction, weapons have played a crucial role as the provider and protector, satiating the thirst for power. Weaponry is the essential tool for settling disputes, defining heroes, villains, victims, and victors, acting as both the liberator and the repressor. Often, the harshest verdict is the ultimate result of our intrigue and obsession with weaponry; a fetish fueled by the necessity to nurture and harness man‚Äôs volatile ego.  International activities  Starting in 2007, the Antagonist began actively developing cultural exchanges with artists in other countries. Antagonist artists traveled to Germany in 2007, to Portugal in 2010, and to Ecuador in 2013. In addition, the Antagonist Movement is actively seeking contacts with artists in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.  Films  These low-budget films were made with funding from the Thursday night art shows and from sales of art and Antagonist merchandise. In recent years, the Antagonists have used Kickstarter.com to fund production of a series of films, many of which document Antagonist art events and profile upcoming artists. Each film acts as a vehicle for promoting local talent, highlighting artists, actors, filmmakers, writers and musicians.  The Soft Hustle (2000)  The 70-minute narrative film is the story of a Lower East Side lowlife who makes a bet for $1,000, which he promptly loses. The film took four years to complete. Ethan H. Minsker and his crew filmed one scene per week until its completion. Real guns were used as it was cheaper than renting props or getting required city permits. The drugs in the Atlantic City scenes were also authentic. The story is based on real events that took place in the bar where Minsker had begun to bartend. It is a narrative film made from donated or stolen resources.  Mark of the Ninja (2004)  This film covers the art events of the Antagonist Movement in 2004. It showcases one night art shows, writers nights and a street art project. The film won the award as Best Documentary in the Evil City Film Fest. It has been screened at the New Directors Series at the Anthology Film Archives in New York. The film was re-released on DVD with the film Anything Boys Can Do by the Antagonist Movement and is sub-distributed by Emphasis Entertainment Group.  This Is Berlin, Not New York (2008)  This 72-minute feature art documentary is about Antagonist artists making art and friends overseas. The film is sold at places like St. Mark's Bookshop and the Brooklyn Museum of Arts gift shop. The DVD is distributed by the Antagonist Movement and sub-distributed by Emphasis Entertainment Group.  The Dolls of Lisbon (2011)  This 72-minute art documentary features underground artists from the United States, Ecuador, Portugal, and fellow Antagonist artists in Europe. In this film, interviews of artists in their own studio space are featured throughout the film as well as covering three weeks of events in Lisbon. It took three years to complete.  Self Medicated (2014)  \\"Whether you are a successful artist, an unproven entity, or struggling to create while working a 9-5, there is a common thread amongst most creative types: a depression that is kept at bay by producing new works. Art can serve an artist much in the same way any drug might.\\" Self Medicated is a film about art, artists, and their struggles to stay happy. This film documents the entire history of the Antagonist Movement and the artists involved, employing animation, stop-motion film techniques, interviews, and a killer soundtrack that spans the globe. From the street to the gallery and back again, Self Medicated reveals a new wave in art from the last American art movement.  Broadcast   Current TV (2007‚Äì2008)  Originally scheduled to be a ten episode series about the Antagonist Movement, only four episodes were broadcast after the channel changed its format to half-hour shows. NYC Underwater, Angst, Lies & Audio Tape, Make Your Own Damn Shirt and Album Armor were featured in the shows. The producer of this series, Anthony Ferraro, is a member of the Antagonist. He worked on a number of Antagonist films before moving to California and beginning work at Current TV. Some of the short Antagonist videos where featured on Current‚Äôs foreign channels as well as in-flight programming for Virgin Atlantic.  Public Access TV (2003-present)  Titled \\"Antagovision\\", this show is broadcast on Manhattan Neighborhood Network Channel 67 every Tuesday night at 11 pm. There are more than 60 28-minute episodes, interviews, live music and short films of the events sponsored by the Antagonist Movement.  Publishing  The Antagonist Movement began its publishing department after taking over Psycho Moto fanzine, which created yet another outlet for artists and writers. Attempting to diverge from the publishing establishment, the Antagonists placed an emphasis on multiple layers of editing and art direction. Each published work is designed to be a stand-alone piece of art. Writers and artists are paired up for each project. Promotion sometimes consists of plastering the New York City with posters and stickers of the books. Each book release incorporates an art show based on the theme of the book or publication.  Psycho Moto Zine (2000‚Äì2006, 2013-Present)  The new incarnation of the fanzine took on a role of supporting young artists. The idea was born from a realization that there are few opportunities for struggling artists and writers to showcase their work. The fanzine serves as a platform for exposure. Ethan H. Minsker's experience with producing this fanzine in its previous form (East Coast Exchange) inspired the formation of the Antagonist Movement.  Somewhere Between a Punch and a Handshake (2004)  Published by the Antagonist Movement, this book was written by Brother Mike Cohen with artwork by Andy Mags, Un Lee and Vickers Gringo. The book features disturbing short stories of the life and times of Brother Mike who has an obsession with classic rock and a love for Buffalo New York and his cat. Brother Mike hosts the writer's night and was discovered while working as a DJ at Niagara bar. Brother Mike's spoken word performance can be seen in the movie, Mark of the Ninja.  Rich Boy Cries for Momma (2010)  A fictional memoir by Ethan H. Minsker. A coming-of-age novel that is set during the period of D.C.‚Äôs now legendary hardcore music scene. It follows Minsker's boot prints: the privileged son turned punk rocker. The story is drawn from Minsker's experiences growing up in Washington, D.C. during the '70s and '80s as the son of prominent lawyers. The book features original illustrations by up-and-coming artists: the cover art is the work of Kevin Cyr and the inside illustrations are by Ted Riederer. In August 2011, Rich Boy Cries for Momma was featured in the art show \\"I Bleed Black\\" at the Marianne Boesky Gallery.  Barstool Prophets (2011)  A fictional memoir by Ethan H. Minsker. The second in a trilogy of novels, is set in the bars of New York's Lower East Side. Giving fictional accounts of true events, the novel follows the lives of a wild spectrum of characters, narrated by a young writer working in a bar. The story chronicles an iconic neighborhood over a period of 20 years, from its seedy early '90s to its recent gentrification into a Manhattan hot spot. The cover art is by Dan Krupin and the inside illustrations are by Dan Krupin and Un Lee. This book was produced in the same vein as Minsker's first book, Rich Boy Cries for Momma; it is both a work of art and of literature.  Iconography   Clothing line  Beginning with a line of T-shirts, the Antagonists hand-printed a limited number of original designs by a variety of artists all of whom had show previously with the Antagonists. The clothing line has been expanded to hats, patches, jackets, pins, wristbands and sweatshirts. Some of the clothing items were made in collaboration with designer Michael Houghton. The money raised from sales of clothes and movie DVDs fund art projects, films, fanzines and travel expenses.  Logos  The different logos of the Antagonist Movement were designed by Gabriel Coutu- Dumont, Un Lee, Doug McQueen and James Jajac.

Burt House is a historic house located at 400 Fifth Avenue in Leavenworth, Kansas. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 27, 1987. Source of information about the Burt children and Carroll Mansion Museum is from the Leavenworth County Historical Society at the Carroll Mansion Museum (next door to the Burt House), 1128 Fifth Avenue.  Architectural design  Nathaniel H. Burt had become a prominent Leavenworth businessman by 1895 when he built the Nathaniel H. Burt House at 1200 Fifth Avenue for his wife and two sons. The architect was William Pratt Feth, a native of Leavenworth, who had just returned after several years of schooling at the Armour institute in Chicago and apprenticed work in Denver on the famed Dennis Sheedy Mansion. Mr. Feth remained in Leavenworth the rest of his life where there are over 60 public and residential structures to his credit. These include the County Courthouse, City Hall, the AXA Building, the Corner Pharmacy, and the former Montgomery Ward building, now known as J.W. Crancers. Mr. Feth designed the home in the Romanesque Revival style reminiscent of the work of H.H. Richardson. The overall irregular facades are typical of the late Victorian period. Using brick with limestone trim and foundation, the exterior is highly ornamented. Original blueprints of the approximately 54‚Äô by 65‚Äô structure are maintained by the current owners as well as Leavenworth Public Works. The carriage house, immediately behind the main building, was constructed in 1920, and reflects the style of the main house.  Refurbishment and renovations  The home underwent an extensive interior refurbishment in the early 1980‚Äôs under the oversight of both William and Annett McCollum as well as Leah S. Waage. Extensive use of the Bradbury and Bradbury Victorian Wallpaper Company have been integrated throughout the home. The extensive use of these wallcoverings were custom made for each room where they were installed. They portray the early The Victorian Era (1837-1901), which was a period of transformation. In the decorative arts, this vibrant era did not produce merely one style, it produced many. Historical revivals, an anti-industrial return to nature, futurism, and Oriental exoticism all coexisted in the public imagination, and were often found in enthusiastic, if not startling, decorative combinations. Additional notable interior features include the large stained glass window and fully functional curved radiator on the stairway, Oak, cherry, and bird‚Äôs eye maple pocket doors, and the chandelier within the foyer. In its current configuration, the home has 5 bedrooms, 3 ¬Ω baths, and three separate levels.  The Burt family and ownership  In 1876 Nathaniel Henry Burt married Rosamond O. Pratt. She was born at the Baptist Indian Mission, south of Leavenworth, March 26, 1854, the daughter of missionaries, Rev. John Gill Pratt and his wife, Olivia E. Evans. They had come from Boston to the Shawnee Baptist Mission in Johnson County in 1837, taking charge of the printing office of the Rev. Jotham Meeker. Children born to Nathaniel and Rosamond were Nathaniel Pratt (born 1877) and Eugene (born 1881). Nathaniel Pratt married Dorothy Gordon and inherited the house when his father died in 1923. After her husbands death in 1960, his wife sold the home in 1962 to Robert G. & Daphne M. Mundinger. There have been three subsequent families since then; Charles & Louise Moore, Robert & Audrey Wallis, and William & Annette McCollum, all prior to the current owners, Mr. and Mrs. Austin. Both Burt sons were involved in the Great Western Stove Company and inherited their fathers interests. Eugene and his wife Edith, daughter of Joseph & Sadie Cranston, who lived just up the street, had two daughters: Rosamond and Barbara. Rosamond married John Brock Taylor, who was affiliated with the First National Bank. Nathaniel P. Burt donated a good number of the Burt family early day furnishings to the Carroll Mansion Museum, which date from around 1900. The famous ‚ÄúKeller Dog‚Äù that stands on the front lawn of the museum was donated by Rosamond Burt Taylor. The Everhard Glass Plate Negative Collection, owned by the museum, includes numerous portraits of the Burt family. Its original owner, Nathaniel H. Burt, moved to Leavenworth in 1875 and started working for the Great Western Stove Company. He became the treasurer of the company in 1885, then became its president in 1911. His house, built in 1895, was fitting for a prominent city businessman. The houses architect, William P. Feth, had recently returned to Leavenworth after architectural school and training in Chicago, from 1885 through 1890, and more training in Denver from 1890 through 1895. The design of the house is influenced by Henry Hobson Richardson elements, such as its material, form, and overall feeling. Some influence of Richard Morris Hunt's architecture is reflected in the ornamented dormers and an oriel window. and '  Register  In October 1987, the Burt house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its significance as the residence of one of the cities early & influential industrial families. It was also awarded a historical plaque by the Leavenworth County Historical Society in May 1997.

Asco adopted its name as a collective in 1973, making a direct reference to the word's significance in Spanish (\\"asco\\"), which is disgust or repulsion. Asco's work throughout 1970s and 1980s responded specifically to socioeconomic and political problems surrounding the Chicano community in the United States, as well the Vietnam War. Harry Gamboa, Jr., Glugio \\"Gronk\\" Nicandro, Willie Herr√≥n and Patssi Valdez form the core members of the group. Origins  Political and Cultural Influences  The term Asco functions as a means of contextualizing and responding to the effects of the Vietnam war. This era, which art historian Arthur C. Danto has described as an era of revulsion, compelled young people to seek a new vocabulary for opposition through the growing importance of media, the impact of public mobilization, and new modes drawn from Happenings and spontaneous \\"be-ins\\". Socio-economic and regional factors additionally gave cause for revulsion. The shifting landscape of East Los Angeles during the 70s was particularly influential in Asco's work. The construction of freeway interchanges and the retention of walls dividing formerly connected neighborhoods fostered a hostile environment. Asco as a group was part of what Raul Homero Villa deems the \\"expressway generation\\", a generation aware and affected by how public policies and urban planning could create conditions of disparity and stratification both economically and geographically. Last year at this time I was very active in the affairs of my community. I was deeply bothered and disgusted with the condition of my community and of the Mexican American people. I learned to distrust and dislike everything that was pro- establishment.‚ÄîHarry Gamboa Jr., 1969.Harry Gamboa, Jr. \\"Autobiography: 1960 EOP Admissions Statement,\\" M753, Box 2, Folder 26, East Los Angeles Walkouts and related miscellaneous/ Garfield High School, c. 1968-70, Gamboa Collection, Stanford Libraries Special Collections, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA The members were, as Mr. Gamboa has described it, \\"self-imposed exiles\\" who felt the best way to exercise artistic freedom and express solidarity with the Mexican-American cause was, paradoxically, to run screaming from most Mexican-American art at the time, or at least from its political structures and the stereotypes imposed on it by mainstream culture. Asco's emphasis on the street in their work and media hoaxes they manufactured illustrated the mergence of performance art with activism and protest. Asco occupies a unique place in the cultural landscape of Los Angeles. It deviated from the Chicano Muralism movement which was heavily nationalistic, instead occupied a balanced position between the mainstream and its counter-movement.  Artistic Influences  Some heavy influences of Asco art were Dada and Arte Povera. They used similar methods of recycling and appropriation to make something entirely different in meaning and form.  Historical context in East LA  \\"Geographically and culturally segregated from the then-embryonic L.A. contemporary art scene and aesthetically at odds with the dominant Chicano nationalism, at times Asco found a home in the new, interdisciplinary, artist-run spaces like Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE). On other occasions they chose to bypass galleries and museums altogether, and exhibit and perform in the streets.\\" \\"We only know the east side, we don't really know the west side and the west side doesn't know us.\\" ‚Äì Willie Herron > Los Angeles has little sense of the past or of place. A partial explanation > for this is that Euroamericans have devoted little time or energy to > learning the history of the region, treating that history much the same as > they do learning other languages ...

Additional members In addition to the core members, the following notable artists were also involved with Asco at one point or another: * Robert Beltran * Cyclona (Robert Lagorretta) * Jerry Dreva * Diane Gamboa * Mundo Meza * Humberto Sandoval * Ruben Zamora  Community and Method  Asco's aesthetic proposals were principally informed by questions that dealt with the way in which U.S. national politics affected the Chicano community, which they culturally identified with, and addressed through their works. That said, Asco really defied older Chicano methods of artistic resistance against exclusion. There was a considerable amount of anti-Chicano propaganda through mainstream journalism and commercial television therefore creating within Asco an artistic response that would counter the saturation of negative images about the Chicano movement. They decided to create works which were concerned with socioaesthetic modes such as violence and street life. The surreal nature of the work jarred the sensibilities of the traditionalist audience.Jackson, Carlos F. Chicana and Chicano Art: Protestarte. Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 2009. Print. Their methods evolved and tried to move away from the static nature of Muralism towards performance where they had public displays of what they called no emotion, and finally these performances were conceptualized for their new photographic genre of the No Movie.Jackson, Carlos F. Chicana and Chicano Art: Protestarte. Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 2009. Print. The sequence of No Movies was conceptualized by Gamboa as a photonovela, like a comic book illustrated with photographs.James, David E. \\"Hollywood Extras: One Tradition of \\"Avant-Garde\\" Film in Los Angeles.\\" October 90 (1999): 3-24. Web. The implication of the No Movies' merging of protocinematic performance and the still image into which it was condensed becomes evident when we contrast it with the murals which they were initially constructed against. Asco's work had a transient nature along with the poverty of their means, and their aestheticization of everyday barrio life they signaled a critique of the Murals commitment to durability, idealized imagery, and at some times the use of expensive paint. Therefore, with all this in mind the singularity of the photographs found in the No Movies gesture towards a narrative yet unlike industrialized and glamorized Hollywood they are Imperfect, materially limited alluding by that to their political situation. Works Regeneraci√≥n (1971) Gamboa, Gronk, Herron, and Valdez's first collaboration was Regeneraci√≥n, a journal propagating Chicano cultural and political nationalism. Harry Gamboa Jr. became editor in 1971 and Gronk, Herron, and Valdez were recruited individually by Gamboa to create art for the journal. Initially the magazine was published as Carta Editorial under activist Francisca Flores. The name change to Regeneraci√≥n in 1970 pays homage to the radical newspaper of the same name published in Los Angeles by the Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM) led by Ricardo Flores Magon during the Mexican Revolution in the 1900s. The name change marks a shift of editorial emphasis and format provoked by the advent of a new political era while both referencing and embodying historical continuity of Chicano activism in Los Angeles . Regeneraci√≥n was one of the many publications produced during the Chicano movement. Each publication had its own regional focus and political agenda. Regeneraci√≥n functioned as a venue for both early Chicana feminist thought and for the artwork of the Asco, who had recently graduated from high school. It is characteristic of the print culture of the Chicano movement through its convergence of commentary, news, photojournalism, poetry, and visual art. As opposed to the conventional medium of Social Realism, Asco instead contextualized aspects of the avant-garde into their own circumstances. The images they produced expressed the absurdity and violence of their experience in East Los Angeles in the early 1970s. The magazine's studio space was provided by Herron, who used his mother's garage as an art studio. Regeneraci√≥n's first volume featured artwork directly corresponding with the political and cultural orientation of other Chicano publications and also adopted a lengthier magazine format. =Gamboa's involvement with Regeneraci√≥n= Gamboa joined Regeneraci√≥n in the midst of the riot of August 29, 1970, in East L.A. at the Chicano Moratorium. He encountered Francisca Flores, where she handed him her copy of Regeneraci√≥n and agreed to allow Gamboa to edit the next issue. This event proved decisive in creating a sense of urgency within the Chicano movement and was highly influential in the work of Asco. Gamboa's drawings appearing in the subsequent issue drew on pre- Conquest imagery while coinciding with the iconography associated with the radical press and the Chicano movement. The following volume included contributions from Willie F. Herr√≥n III and Patssi Valdez. Their contributions allowed artwork to gain a more prominent role in the magazine. Their artwork conveys the group's (and mainly Gamboa's) anger, frustration, and despair at the events and aftermath of the Chicano Moratorium. Their frustrations were aimed namely towards corruption in the police force and towards the death of journalist Ruben Salazar by the L.A. County Sheriffs, which perpetuated violence towards the Chicano population. =Herr√≥n, Valdez's and Gronk's contributions= In contrast to the specificity of Gamboa's contributions, Herr√≥n's contributions focus on the broader conditions of life in the barrio, namely the environment of violence and poverty and the suffering it imposes. His work is characterized by a level of abstraction which produces imagery that is frequently dark, pessimistic, and grotesque. His influences extend from die Neue Sachlichkeit and German Expressionism to Surrealism. Valdez contributed a number of drawings to the first issues and by the final issue of Regeneraci√≥n she expanded her work to combine ink drawing with collage, performance, photography, and texts. Many of her mixed media collages and photographs address the representation of femininity and self in terms of performativity. Gronk's drawings were described as \\"broodingly implicit with dream-sexual connotations.\\" Performance art and No Movies During the 1970s Gamboa, Gronk, Herron, and Valdez collaborated on numerous projects which addressed contemporary popular culture and specifically the media. =Stations of the Cross and Walking Mural= Stations of the Cross, a reference to Christ's carrying of the cross to his crucifixion, was one of Asco's earliest collaborations. Performed on Christmas Eve in 1971, Stations of the Cross functioned as a Vietnam war protest and poked fun at Catholic traditions. The members of Asco dressed in costumes and carried a huge cardboard cross down Whittier Boulevard in East Los Angeles, and subsequently a crowd of holiday shoppers gathered. Asco led them to the local U.S. Marine recruiting station, then used the cross to blockade the entrance. The performance was meant to mock the Chicano mural movement by utilizing stereotypical religious iconography prevalent in Chicano Muralism. The group performed Walking Mural the following year on Christmas Eve. The members of the group appropriated stereotypical Chicano iconography into their dress, with Valdez parodying the ubiquitous Virgen de Guadalupe. This piece put Asco into a dangerous situation due to the potential for violent community reaction. Regarding this fact, Gamboa reflected that, \\"Ether the police were going to take care of you or someone in the neighborhood was going to take care of you. So you met a lot of resistance because it was so conservative. And to even to stray into the sensitive area of religious icons or even hinting that you might not believe in certain things or might even question what America is all about, again, you were setting yourself up to be someone that's punished\\". =Spray Paint LACMA= Asco, Spray Paint LACMA, 1972. Colour photograph. Photograph: Harry Gamboa, Jr, showing Patssi Valdez. Spray Paint LACMA is Asco's most well-known No Movie. The piece was done in reaction to racial prejudices against Chicanos perpetuated by a curator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1972. Gamboa met with the curator to discuss the possibility of including Chicano art in future exhibitions, only to be told that Chicanos were incapable of producing anything other than folk art. In response, Asco spray-painted their names onto the outside entrance of LACMA. Utilizing graffiti as a technique alludes to the stereotype of the Chicano as a gang member who vandalizes public spaces. Asco appropriates the technique of graffiti as an assertive means of resistance. Spray Paint LACMA was documented in photos by Gamboa and Valdez and their names were whitewashed within the next day. ‚âàInstant Mural‚âà This piece up was created by, ‚ÄúGronk, who had previously established himself alongside Herr√≥n as a noteworthy muralist, performed as auteur in Instant Mural (1974), taping Valdez and frequent collaborator Humberto Sandoval to a wall.‚Äù In an article written by Emily Colucci, she writes, ‚ÄúForcing the general public to confront the Chicano body, Asco again deftly merged art and politics.‚Äù (Hyperallergic). With this statement it further supports the purpose of the mural, which is being able to identify and accept the varieties of how the Chicano body is presented. Williams Magazine further adds, ‚ÄúInstant Mural is a metaphor for thinking about how people can be confined in conditions of oppression or discrimination, poverty and other social‚Äîand psychological‚Äîissues.‚Äù https://hyperallergic.com/37283/occupy-wall-street-artforum-asco/ https://magazine.williams.edu/2012/spring/feature/asco-claiming-power-with- art/ No Movies No Movies addresses the exclusion of Chicanos within both mainstream Hollywood and the avant-garde cinemas of Los Angeles. No Movies consisted of conceptual performance art which usually involved elaborate scenarios and utilizing the landscape of Los Angeles as a set. The scenarios were recorded on 35 mm slides, with one chosen for projection as the official record. The final film still functioned as a poster, summarizing and advertising a movie that was non-existent. No Movies occupy a liminal space between the mural movement and the Super-8 films. Asco utilized the limited material resources available to them to allegorize their political situation. The stills were later disseminated throughout the community through their use in presentations in schools, colleges, and public libraries, and eventually into the art world and media. Additionally the group invented the Asco Awards, also known as the Aztl√°n or No Movies Awards, in order to parody similar ceremonies held by Hollywood. List of No-Movies * Tumor Hats: 1973: Gronk, Herron, and Valdez held a parody of a fashion show by posing in an empty theater while wearing hats made with junk materials. * First Supper (After a Major Riot)/Instant Mural: 1974: Asco set a dinner table decorated with paintings of tortured corpses, a large nude doll, and mirrors on a traffic island on Whittier Boulevard, where three years earlier the police opened fire with shotguns on an assembled crowd. Asco prepared a celebratory feast of fruit and drink on the table. They designed the feast in order to encourage people to express themselves publicly, so as to contest the paramilitary police occupation of the barrio. At the end of the supper Asco performed Instant Mural. Gronk taped Patssi Valdez and Humberto Sandoval to a wall by a bus stop. The pair ignored passersby who offered to help untangle them. After an hour, Valdez and Sandoval walked away from the scene as if nothing had happened. Gronk felt that, \\"...the idea of oppression was that tape ... It had a conceptual message--a thought-provoking one: how we are bound to our community and get bound to our environment. How we get caught up in the red tape\\". * Cruel Profit (1974): Herr√≥n ritualistically destroys a doll in a still orchestrated by Gamboa, which was later translated to video. * √Å La Mode (1976): After ordering apple pie and coffee at Philippe's Original Sandwich Shop in Los Angeles, Asco members struck poses invoking classic movie stills while simultaneously expressing disdain towards the more fashionable patrons of the restaurant. * Search and No Seizure, La Dolce, Waiting For Tickets: 1978: These three No Movies chronicle a melodramatic love affair between Valdez and Guillermo Estrada (a.k.a. Billy Star). Search and No Seizure was a performance piece in which the lovers posed in a passionate embrace in a tunnel under Bunker Hill. The piece was interrupted by harassment from the police. The next segment of the series, entitled La Dolce, parodies Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita. La Dolce was performed at the Music Center, where cultural forms including the Opera and Symphony Orchestra of the city intersect with the downtown financial establishment. Waiting for Tickets concludes the series with the lovers embracing and rolling down the Music Center's steps. The scene functions as a mock \\"Odessa Steps\\" sequence, which Asco considered satire. Waiting for Tickets ridicules the city's cultural elite by expressing despair over the impossibility of being admitted to these institutions. The title refers to Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot.

He passed the entrance examination from Sylhet Government Pilot High School in 1966 and Intermediate examination from Sylhet MC College in 1968. He received his graduate and post-graduate degree from the University of Dhaka respectively in 1971 and 1972. Later he went to Canada and earned a PhD from Queen's University, Kingston in 1981. In 1989, he went to the University of Southern Mississippi at Hattiesburg as a Fulbright Scholar and taught there one semester. He retired from the faculty position at the University of Dhaka and joined University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh. Literary writings Islam used to write from his childhood. While reading in class six, he published his writing in a magazine, Shikkhok Samachar. During his university days as a student, his friend's father fell sick and died in pain. This emotionally affected Islam and led him to write his first story, \\"Bishal Mrittu\\" in 1973. It received a positive response; but he abstained from publishing anything during his days in Canada. On his return to Bangladesh, he returned to writing and began contributing a regular column \\"Olosh Diner Hawa\\" in the literary section of the Dainik Sangbad. He wrote on issues including art and literature. In 1989, Islam started writing for the magazine Bichinta, which published many of his post-modern stories. Islam describes himself as \\"a critic by training and a writer by compulsion\\". Though he writes in many genres, he himself values his fictional work more than his other writings. In his stories, he usually incorporates his own experiences. He tries to live the life of his characters, seeing the world through their eyes and describing their pain and happiness.

Parish church Tradition holds that Edward the Confessor (circa 1004‚Äì66) was baptised in a church in Islip. The Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas the Confessor has certainly existed since at least 1065, but the earliest part of the present building is the arcade between the nave and north aisle, which was built in about 1200 in the Transitional style between Early English and Decorated Gothic. The chancel was rebuilt in 1780. In 1861 the Gothic Revival architect E.G. Bruton remodelled the chancel and restored the rest of the church. In 1824 some medieval wall-paintings were uncovered in the south aisle. They included an Adoration of the Magi and a weighing of souls, both of which were considered to have been painted late in the 14th century. There was also an earlier Adoration, over which the later version had been painted, and there was also a Resurrection. All the paintings were plastered over during Bruton's restoration of the St. Nicholas' in 1861. William Buckland, theologian, geologist and palaeontologist, is buried at the church. St. Nicholas' parish church is Islip's only Grade I Listed Building. Bells and clock The belltower had a ring of five bells cast in the 17th century. In 1859 George Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry recast them into a ring of six. In 1956 Mears and Stainbank of Whitechapel increased this to eight by casting the present treble and second bells. St. Nicholas' has also a Sanctus bell cast in 1652 by James Keene of Woodstock. The date of the church clock is unknown. It may be late 17th century, and is believed to have been made by Edward Hemins (the elder) of Bicester. Benefice Past incumbents of the parish include John Islip, Hugh Weston (1554 until 1558), John Aglionby (1600 until 1611), Thomas Atkinson (from 1638), Robert South (1678 until 1716), William Freind (1748 until 1766), William Vincent (1807 until 1815), John Ireland (1816 until 1835), the geologist William Buckland (1846 until 1856), Francis Trench (1857 until 1875) and Michael Scott-Joynt (1976 until 1981). The Church of England parish is now part of the Benefice of the Ray Valley. Rectory Rev. Dr. South, who founded Islip's parish school in 1710, had the then Rectory built for him in 1689. The Rectory is a Cotswold stone double pile house of five bays with attic dormer windows, 18th century sash windows and a central doorcase with canopy on carved brackets. William Vincent had the house enlarged in 1807, and it was restored in the middle of the 19th century. The Old Rectory is Islip's only Grade II* Listed Building. Edward the Confessor's chapel King Edward the Confessor was born in Islip in about 1004. A chapel associated with him used to exist north of the church. Monks from Westminster Abbey studying at Gloucester College, Oxford used to celebrate the feast of St. Edward at the chapel. In April 1645 during the English Civil War the chapel was damaged in a military engagement, and in the 1780s it was demolished. In 2006 the Channel 4 archaeology programme Time Team visited Islip and tried unsuccessfully to find the remains of the chapel.

It diverts water from the Kishanganga River (Neelum River) to a power plant in the Jhelum River basin. It is located north of Bandipore in Jammu and Kashmir and has an installed capacity of 330 MW. Construction on the project began in 2007 and was expected to be complete in 2016. Construction on the dam was temporarily halted by the Hague's Permanent Court of Arbitration (CoA) in October 2011 due to Pakistan's protest of its effect on the flow of the Kishanganga River (called the Neelum River in Pakistan). In December 2013, the Court ruled that India could divert water for power generation while ensuring a minimum flow of 9 cumecs (m3/s) downstream to Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir.Kishanganga project: Victory claims cloud final arbitration award, The Express Tribune, 22 December 2013. All three units of 110 MW each were commissioned and synchronized with the electricity grid by 30 March 2018. On 19 May 2018, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the project. Design The west-flowing Jhelum River has two main tributaries, one being the Kishenganga River (Neelum River) in the north, at a higher elevation, and the other being the Jhelum river itself at a lower elevation. The two rivers originate in Indian-administered Kashmir and flow west into Pakistan-administered Kashmir, joining together near Muzaffarabad. This situation presents a unique opportunity of diverting waters from the Kishenganga river into the Jhelum river through a tunnel and using the consequent flows to generate power. Both India and Pakistan have explored the possibility and came up with respective projects: the Kishenganga project in Indian-administered Kashmir and the Neelum‚ÄìJhelum project in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The Kishanganga project includes a tall concrete-face rock-fill dam which diverts a portion (58.4 m3/sec) of the Kishanganga River south through a tunnel. The tunnel is received by a surge chamber before sending water to the underground power house which contains Pelton turbine-generators. After the power plant, water is discharged through a tail race channel into Bonar Nallah, another tributary of Jhelum (at ). After a short distance the Bonar Nallah drains into the Wular Lake, on the course of the Jhelum River. The drop in elevation from the dam to the power station provides a hydraulic head of . The dam is equipped with a lower level orifice spillway to transfer flood water as well as silt downstream to protect the power generation reliability and the operating life of the project. The arbitration award permitted the lower level orifice spillway as envisaged by India but prohibited the depletion of dead storage. Indus waters dispute The waters of the Jhelum river and its tributaries are allocated to Pakistan under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 (part of the three 'western rivers' ‚Äì Indus, Jhelum and Chenab). However, India is allowed \\"non-consumptive\\" uses of the water such as power generation. Under the treaty, India is obliged to inform Pakistan of its intent to build a project six months prior to construction and take into account any concerns raised by the latter. Pakistan strenuously objected to the project, claiming that India was not permitted under the Treaty to divert waters from one tributary to another. Experts have disagreed with this contention. John Briscoe, a former World Bank water expert, points out that the \\"far-sighted Indian and Pakistani engineers\\" who drafted the treaty very well anticipated the situation.John Briscoe, Winning the battle but losing the war, The Hindu, 22 February 2013. The paragraph 15 of Annexure D states, Nevertheless, Pakistan maintained that the diversion of water was prohibited. Asif H. Kazi, an influential water professional, declared, \\"the treaty absolutely forbids India from undertaking their project\\".Kazi, Asif H. \\"Misusing the Indus Treaty\\", The News, 1 July 2011. Other than the legal objection, Pakistan also had concerns that the project would affect the flow of waters into Pakistan-administered Kashmir along the Kishanganga riverbed, impacting agriculture in \\"thousands of acres\\" as well as Pakistan's own planned Neelum‚ÄìJhelum project downstream. Experts estimated that the impact on the Neelum‚ÄìJhelum project would be only about 10 percent, because 70 percent of the waters of Kishanganga/Neelum are generated within Pakistan-administered Kashmir (after passing through the Kishanganga project)Ramaswamy R. Iyer, Arbitration & Kishenganga project, The Hindu 25 June 2010. and the project itself reduces the flow by only 21 to 27 percent. Unable to agree with India, Pakistan raised a 'dispute' under the Indus Waters Treaty, asking the World Bank to assemble a Court of Arbitration. This was the first time a Court of Arbitration (CoA) was assembled under the treaty.  Court of Arbitration  Judge Stephen Schwbel, chairman of the Court of Arbitration A Court of Arbitration assembled under the Indus Water Treaty is expected to have seven members, two members each nominated by India and Pakistan, and three 'umpires' appointed by recognised authorities: the chairman appointed by the United Nations secretary-general and the World Bank president, a legal member/umpire appointed by US Chief Justice and Lord Chief Justice of England, an engineer member/umpire appointed by the President of MIT and the Rector of Imperial College, London.B. G. Verghese, Ideology Threatens Indus Treaty, The South Asian Journal, 25 March 2010. A distinguished panel was thus assembled to hear the case. The Court began by rejecting Pakistan's arguments that the Kishanganga project violated the provisions of the treaty. Then it considered whether the project satisfied the treaty's requirements for hydroelectric plants. Article III(2) obligates India to \\"let flow all the waters of Western Rivers\\" and \\"not permit any interference with the waters\\". Pakistan argued that the project violated Annexure D of the treaty in three respects: * by the permanent diversion of waters from one tributary to another, * by failure to conform to the requirements for a permitted run-of-the-river plant (by locating the plant along a diversion rather than at the dam site), and * by a diversion of waters between two tributaries that was not \\"necessary\\". The court rejected all three objections by analysing the treaty and its negotiating history. The final question was whether the diversion met the requirement of protecting \\"the then existing agricultural use or hydro-electric use by Pakistan\\". The court addressed the issue with a sophisticated Vienna Convention analysis. It rejected Pakistan's \\"ambulatory\\" interpretation that all its future uses that might evolve over time were protected, and upheld India's interpretation that only those uses existing when Pakistan was given complete information about the project were protected. The court determined that the Neelum‚ÄìJhelum project did not exist at the time the Kishenganga project \\"crystallized\\". Hence, it was not protected by the treaty provisions. The court upheld India's right to proceed with the Kishanganga project. But it also concluded that the treaty and the customary international law required India to ensure a minimum environmental flow along the Kishanganga/Neelum riverbed. After requesting additional data from India and Pakistan to determine the requirements for minimum flow, the court determined this to be 12 cumecs. Balancing this figure against India's right to the satisfactory operation of its project, it set down 9 cumecs as the required minimum flow to be ensured at all times.  Drawdown flushing  The CoA also ruled that India shall not lower/draw down the water level below the dead storage level for sediment flushing purpose. CoA also stipulated in its verdict that India shall maintain minimum environmental flows in the Kishanganga river at the line of control point not be less than 9 cumecs continuously. However, the minor differences between India and Pakistan over the project are still not settled. Construction The Project was taken up by National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC). The construction was carried out by Hindustan Construction Company.Nirupama Subramanian, Long objected by Pakistan, Kishanganga Hydro Electric Project set for inauguration next month, The Indian Express, 30 April 2018. Benefits In addition to generating 330 MW power, the diverted water from the Kishanganga River is used for the purpose of irrigation or to generate additional electricity from the downstream Lower Jhelum (105 MW), Uri (720 MW) and proposed Kohala (1124 MW) (Pakistan) hydel projects located on the Jhelum River. Future scope It is stipulated by the CoA that India shall release 9 cumecs (nearly 283 million cubic meters in a year) for the purpose of environmental flows into the river to reach Pakistan territory. Though there is no stipulation per IWT to maintain minimum environmental flows for a run of the river hydropower plant, CoA stipulated the same as the requirement under Customary international law. The CoA verdict (page 43) also made provision to contest the minimum environmental flow requirement after 7 years of commissioning the Kishanganga power plant. In case of storage works, Annexure E(20) of IWT clearly permits that the stored water can be used fully in any manner by India without the need to release water to the downstream for minimum environmental flows. There is nearly 50 square kilometers river catchment area below the Kishanganga dam before the river enters in to Pakistan. Downstream of the Kishanganga dam, the river is taking U-turn to enter in to the Pakistan territory. Nearly 100 million cubic meters capacity storage dam can be envisaged close to the LoC to impound all the inflows which can be further pumped through a 6 km long tunnel in to the upstream Kishanganga dam reservoir. The augmented water in to the Kishanganga dam reservoir is also diverted to the Jhelum river to generate additional power by the 330 MW power plant. As the pumping head (90 m) is not exceeding 15% of the 664 m head available for the power generation, the storage reservoir with pumping facility is highly economical to utilize all the waters of Kishanganga river flowing in India. Water pumping from the storage works/reservoir could be achieved by installing a pumped storage scheme to generate peaking and secondary power additionally. Inauguration Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Kishanganga power plant in the state of Jammu and Kashmir on 19 May 2018. The 330MW Kishanganga hydropower station, work on which started in 2009, is one of the projects that India has fast-tracked in the volatile state amid frosty ties between the nuclear-armed countries. \\"This region cannot only become self-sufficient in power but also produce for other regions of the country,\\" Modi said in the state's capital, Srinagar. \\"Keeping that in mind we have been working on various projects here for the past four years.\\" Pakistan has opposed some of these projects, saying they violate a World Bank-mediated treaty on the sharing of the Indus River and its tributaries upon which 80 percent of its irrigated agriculture depends. Local Concerns In 2013 local population of Bandipora protested against Hindustan Construction Company (HCC) executing the 330 MW Kishenganga hydroelectric project in the area.

She had a probing intellect and a sense of \\"brutal\\" honesty. She also had an \\"encyclopedic\\" knowledge of art history and a passion for Chicana/o art. Life Goldman grew up in New York City and moved to Los Angeles after World War II. Her parents, a trade unionist mother and a political activist father came from Poland and Russia and both exposed Goldman to art and politics at an early age. Goldman went to the High School of Music and Art in New York. When her family moved to Los Angeles, Goldman enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). During her time there, she became involved in civil rights. She took part in the student boycott against barbers in Westwood who would not cut the hair of Black Veterans. Goldman did not finish her degree at this time; instead she chose to dedicate herself to civil rights for Mexican-Americans. She lived in East Los Angeles, where she learned to speak Spanish and in 1952 married John Garcia. Her marriage to Garcia lasted a short time and later she had another brief marriage. For some time, Goldman worked in a factory and then as a bookkeeper to support herself and her son, Eric Garcia. During this time, she continued to be a civil rights activist and was subpoenaed to appear at the panel of the House Un-American Activities Committee where she did not answer any of their questions. In the 1960s she returned to UCLA to complete her B.A. in art. Goldman received a M.A. in art history from California State University, Los Angeles (1966)and returned to UCLA to get her PhD in art history in 1977. When Goldman chose her doctoral topic for her PhD, she had to wait several years for a faculty member to approve her choice of modern Mexican Art. She taught at Santa Ana College, until 1992. She helped save the \\"America Tropical\\" mural, by David Alfaro Siqueiros. Goldman had an impressive collection of archival material relating to art and artists which she donated to the California Ethnic and Multicultural Archives at UC Santa Barbara.

In the past, it was seen as part of a \\"Great Rift Valley\\" that ran from Mozambique to Syria. Description The Great Rift Valley lies between the Ethiopian Plateau to the north and the Somalia Plateau to the south. The rift developed as the Nubian and Somali plates began to separate during the Miocene Period along the East African rift system. Rift initiation was asynchronous along the Ethiopian rift valley: deformation began around 18 million years ago at the south end, around 11 million years ago close to the Afar depression and probably around 6-8 million years ago in the central sector.Bonini M., Corti G., Innocenti F., Manetti P., Mazzarini F., Abebe T., Pecskay Z; The evolution of the Main Ethiopian Rift in the frame of Afar and Kenya rifts propagation, Tectonics, 24, TC1007, doi:10.1029/2004TC001680 The rift is extending in an ESE-WNW direction at about annually.Corti, G.; Continental rift evolution: from rift initiation to incipient breakup in the Main Ethiopian Rift, East Africa, Earth-Science Reviews, v. 96, p. 1‚Äì53 The Ethiopian rift valley is about wide and bordered on both margins by large, discontinuous normal faults that give rise to major tectonic escarpments separating the rift floor from the surrounding plateaus. These faults are now thought to be inactive at the northern rift valley termination, whereas to the south they are still tectonically and seismically active.Keir, D., Ebinger, C.J., Stuart, G.W., Daly, E. and Ayele, A. Strain accommodation by magmatism and faulting as rifting proceeds to breakup: seismicity of the northern Ethiopian rift, Journal of Geophysical Research, 111(B5), B05314, doi: 10.1029/2005JB003748Agostini A., Bonini M., Corti G., Sani F., Manetti P.; Distribution of Quaternary deformation in the central Main Ethiopian Rift, East Africa, Tectonics, 30, TC4010, doi:10.1029/2010TC002833 The rift floor is cut by a series of smaller en echelon, right-stepping, rift basins of Quaternary to recent age. These basins are about wide and long. In the northern part of the rift, extension within the valley is now thought to be mainly along these faulted and magmatically active segments. These segments are considered to be developing mid ocean ridge spreading centers.Ebinger, C. J. and M.

The Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes occupy the floor of the rift valley between the two highlands. Most of the Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes do not have an outlet, and most are alkaline.

Buildings or roadway or other artifacts at these sites have been preserved and still evoke the army's passage in 1781 and its return in 1782. A multiple- property documentation study completed in 2001 addressed many of the Connecticut sites, and outlined criteria for NRHP-eligibility of others. Recognized historic sites include, from East to West: * University Hall (), Providence, Rhode Island. (1st camp was Providence) * Waterman's Tavern (2nd camp) (), Coventry, Rhode Island * Dorrance Inn (), Sterling, Connecticut * Sterling Hill Historic District () * March Route of Rochambeau's Army: Plainfield Pike () is a 3.6-mile-long road segment in Plainfield and Sterling, Connecticut that is a portion of the historic march route. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. It is a portion of Connecticut Route 14A, locally known as Plainfield Pike, which is level in the eastern part but generally hilly with curves. Along the route is open land including pasture and cornfields, wooded areas, and streams including Ekonk Brook. It is bordered by stone walls about 50 feet apart on both sides for most of the way. The only concentration of houses as of 2002 was of 18th- and 19th-century homes in the Sterling Hill Historic District. The roadway was poor and caused difficulty for the artillery and baggage trains. The segment includes views of countryside evocative of how the land would have been in 1781 for the troops marching through. and * March Route of Rochambeau's Army: Old Canterbury Road () is a historic site in Plainfield, Connecticut along the march route of Rochambeau's army. It includes a stretch of what is now Old Canterbury Road and a stretch of Canterbury Road (Connecticut Route 14A). It is a site that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. This particular segment of the route was deemed historically significant in 2002 \\"because it allows one to imagine the appearance of the Connecticut countryside‚Äîthe cultivated fields, woods, stone walls, and narrow, windy roads‚Äîthat the French army encountered as it made its way to and from the Battle of Yorktown, the engagement that decided the outcome of the American Revolution\\". It was traversed by Rochambeau's troops in June 1781 on their way to Virginia, and again in November 1782 on their return to Rhode Island. Part of the site is a narrow, curving paved road with a border of shrubs and vines and stone walls along much of its length. A stand of mature sugar maple trees gives shade to a portion of the site. Houses along the section are more modern than the 1781-82 era but are set back far enough to not interfere with the evocation of Rochambeau's marching troops. and At the east end of the segment, stone walls are preserved on both sides of the road, and \\"there are expansive views of plowed fields and pasture both to the north and to the south\\" as of 2002. The passage of the French army along this route is documented by a period route map drawn by French military engineer Louis- Alexandre Berthier, republished by Rice and Brown in 1972 and reproduced in the 2002 NRHP nomination document. Manship and Barstow Roads junction Barstow Road to Westminster Road * March Route of Rochambeau's Army: Manship Road- Barstow Road () is part of the march route in Canterbury, Connecticut that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. It is significant as a preserved section of the march route which is followed in this area by Connecticut Route 14. This section, however, is a bypassed loop of road, cut off by a road realignment in the 1930s, and therefore without traffic and not modernized. The section is approximately 1,400 feet of bypassed loop of road on the north side of the main road along Manship Road and Barstow Road, starting from a junction of the loop with Manship Road and running to Westminster Road. It is paved road about 20 feet wide, plus a margin to stone walls lining the road. The designated area is about 50 to 55 feet wide, extending to the walls. The National Register nomination of 2001 includes six photos of narrow roadway, stone walls, and the one house along this section. The house is also historical, dating from about the 1840s, and adds to rather than detracting from the historical feel. Rochambeau's troops marched through here in June 1781 and found the road along this general area to be the most difficult along their whole journey. The road has been paved but the visual appearance is still evocative of the historical period. and * March Route of Rochambeau's Army: Palmer Road () is the section of Palmer Road from the intersection with Miller Road east to a point 800 feet from the junction with Pudding Hill Road in Scotland, Connecticut. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. It was a narrow, steep, stony road then, but now it has expansive views of farmland. The French troops with artillery and wagons reportedly found the marching difficult in this segment, though easier after the hill. It was reportedly viewed by the French as \\"a narrow, steep, and stony road\\" in this segment (per Rice and Brown, 1972, p. 23, cited in NRHP document). and The modern road is paved, but its hilly, winding nature and remnants of stone walls and other elements evoke the experience of the French troops in this section. * March Route of Rochambeau's Army: Scotland Road () is along Scotland Road from the intersection with Back Road to 80 Scotland Road in Windham, Connecticut, approximately 1,700 feet long and a portion of Connecticut Route 14. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. The roadway is modern, but the stone walls and views of countryside are much as they would have been in 1781-82. and * Fourth Camp of Rochambeau's Army, Windham, Connecticut * Forty-Seventh Camp of Rochambeau's Army (), Windham, Connecticut, used on return in 1782 instead of site of 4th camp, also in Windham. * William Williams House () in Lebanon, Connecticut, National Historic Landmark home of a signer of the Declaration of Independence * Governor Jonathan Trumbull's War Office () in Lebanon, Connecticut, also known as the Joseph Trumble Office and Store, which was the most important Revolutionary War-associated building in Connecticut * John Trumbull Birthplace (), Lebanon, Connecticut * White's Tavern (), Andover, Connecticut Bailey Road marker * March Route of Rochambeau's Army: Hutchinson Road () is a historic site in Andover, Connecticut along the 1781-82 march route of Rochambeau's army.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. It is \\"the most intact and evocative section of Rochambeau's route.\\" and Bailey Road originally connected Route 6 with Brandy Street in Bolton but the portion west of the Andover-Bolton town line has since been overgrown and is no longer passable by motor vehicles. A remnant of Bailey Road in Bolton still exists as an unpaved footpath and still retains the characteristic stone walls, as well as two original stone culverts. * Fifth Camp of Rochambeau's Infantry (), also known as Site 12-25, is an archeological site in Bolton, Connecticut that is related to the 1781 campsite of Rochambeau's army. It is a site that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001, listed for its information potential. According to a study completed in 2001, it \\"is an open field that retains its visual qualities, with stone walls marking the same field lines as shown on the map prepared by the French engineers. The camp was occupied for four nights in a row, one night by each regiment, in June, 1781.

Its common names include littleleaf buttercup, small-flower crowfoot, small-flowered buttercup, and kidneyleaf buttercup.Ranunculus abortivus. NatureServe. 2012. It is widespread across much of North America, found in all ten Canadian provinces as well as Yukon and the Northwest Territories, and most of the United States, except Hawaii, Oregon, California, and parts of the Southwest. The specific epithet abortivus is an adjective from Latin \\"pass away\\". It is unknown what it refers to, but it might describes the small petals that look like they have not fully developed. Description Basal leaves, stem leaves, and flower An illustration of an entire plant, from The plants of southern New Jersey (1911), by Witmer Stone Ranunculus abortivus produces erect stems tall. The leaves are variable in shape, and both stems and leaves are hairless. The basal leaves are kidney- shaped to circular and persistent, with scalloped margins, and the stem leaves are alternate and deeply lobed or divided. Those at the bottom have long petioles (stems), those at the top are shorter-stemmed to stemless, with narrow blades or lobes. Each stem can bear up to 50 flowers. The flower has five petals up to long, with a ring of stamens around a round cluster of green carpels. The carpels develop into brown, shiny rounded and slightly flattened achenes with a tiny beak. Ecology The flowers produce both nectar and pollen, which is eaten or gathered by small bees, ladybugs, and hoverflies and other kinds of flies. The seeds and leaves are an occasional food source for animals. The seeds are eaten by small rodents, such as the eastern chipmunk and meadow vole. As in other buttercups, the leaves are mildly toxic, containing a blistering agent, but they are eaten by cottontail rabbits. Both the leaves and seeds are eaten by turkeys. Uses The plant had a variety of uses among Native American groups. The Cherokee cooked and ate the leaves. They used it medicinally for abscesses and sore throat and as a sedative. The Iroquois used it for snakebite and poisoning, smallpox, and toothache.Ranunculus abortivus. Native American Ethnobotany. University of Michigan, Dearborn.

Forming on November 22, the storm initially remained weak. Moving south and later east, it was named Osea on November 24 after achieving windspeeds equal to a Category 1 cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Continuing to intensify, Osea soon reached its peak intensity of . Afterwards, Osea began to weaken because of increased wind shear, and the cyclone started moving southeast. By November 28, Osea was no longer a tropical cyclone. The cyclone brought major damage to some islands in French Polynesia. Around 95% of the infrastructure in Maupiti was destroyed, including 77 homes, an airport, and a town hall. About 30% of the infrastructure in Bora-Bora was destroyed, as well as 309 homes and many yachts. Many roads were also damaged. Almost everything on the north side of the island was destroyed. However, no deaths were reported. The name Osea was retired after this usage of the name. Meteorological history On November 22, 1997, the Fiji Meteorological Service's Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji (RSMC Nadi) and the Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center (NPMOC) started to monitor a tropical depression that had developed about to the northeast of the Northern Cook Island: Manihiki. Over the next two days the depression gradually developed further, as it slowly moved southwards due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge of high pressure. At 1200 UTC on November 23, the NPMOC reported that the depression had become equivalent to a tropical storm and assigned it the designation 06P. Twelve hours later RSMC Nadi named the system Osea after it had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Thereafter, Osea started moving towards the southeast, as an area of high pressure started to develop to the south of the system. During November 25, RSMC Nadi estimated that Osea had become a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, while the NPMOC announced that the system had become equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir- Simpson hurricane wind scale as it moved through French Polynesia. The next day both agency's reported that Severe Tropical Cyclone Osea had reached its peak intensity. RSMC Nadi reported 10-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph); the NPMOC reported peak 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 165 km/h (105 mph) which made it equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane on the SSHS. After attaining peak intensity, Osea gradually weakened. By November 27, the NPMOC had issued their final warning on the system because the convection had become dislocated over from the low level circulation center due to increased wind shear. RSMC Nadi subsequently monitored Osea for another 24 hours before it was last noted by the agency on November 28, around the time it degenerated into a tropical depression. Preparations, impact, and aftermath Prior the arrival of Cyclone Osea on November 24, various cyclone alerts and warnings were issued for the whole of French Polynesia, while authorities strengthened security measures and advised people not to drive. Throughout the archipelago schools were closed. Furthermore, people on the atoll of Scilly were evacuated by helicopter to other islands. Cyclone Osea was extremely destructive to some of the islands in French Polynesia. Over 700 homes were destroyed or severely damaged on Maupiti, Bora-Bora, and Raiatea. Several roofs were blown off of buildings across the archipelago. On Maupiti, an island with a population of 1,100, about 95% of the infrastructure was destroyed. The town hall, two schools, and an airfield were destroyed. The town hall was originally being used as an emergency shelter, but was later evacuated due to strong winds and was later destroyed. Furthermore, many roadways and highways were blocked due to flooding. In addition, 77 homes on the island were destroyed. All but three homes that belonged to Mormons on the island were destroyed. On Bora-Bora, an island which had a population of 4,500 at the time, roughly 30% of the infrastructure was destroyed, including 309 houses. Hotels were also impacted during the storm. On the north side of Bora Bora, nearly everything was destroyed, including the village of Vaitape and a local yacht club. Across Vaitape, roads were blocked by fallen trees and telecommunication lines were severed due to high winds. Seven people on the island were reportedly slightly injured. In addition, the islands of Tahaa, Raiatea, and Moorea all sustained damage, though yachts in Raiatea managed to survive unscathed. In another archipelago, 700 homes and various public infrastructures were at least somewhat destroyed by Osea. In addition to the impact on infrastructure, banana trees were knocked down due to the winds, especially in mountain gardens. Throughout the impacted region, no deaths were reported. Osea was the second tropical cyclone to impact French Polynesia during the season; Cyclone Martin had impacted the islands a few weeks earlier. In the aftermath of the storm, disaster aid was delivered to the victims of Osea. President Gaston Flosse, accompanied by technicians, arrived in Maupiti to help repair the island's electrical and hydraulic systems. A Latter-Day Saint meeting house was used as an emergency shelter, though the house itself sustained minor damage from the storm. The name Osea was later retired from the South Pacific list of tropical cyclone names.

The bridge is important as the only known example of Robert Smith's truss system in Kentucky and the only covered bridge extant known to have been built by Jacob N. Bower (1819-1906). The bridge was constructed in 1874 and is one of thirteen that remain of more than four hundred covered bridges in Kentucky. Around 1912, Jacob Bower's son, Louis, added an arch on each side to support increased traffic using the bridge. The bridge is 114 feet long and 16 feet wide, according to Louis Bower, grandson of Jacob Bower and a local covered bridge builder. Later generations have advanced numerous reasons for the construction of covered bridges, but the historical reason for their existence was the maintenance of structural integrity. The cover allowed timbered trusses and braces to season properly and kept water out of the joints, prolonging their lives by seven to eight times that of an uncovered bridge.

A screw press can be used in place of a belt press, centrifuge, or filter paper. It is a simple, slow moving device that accomplishes dewatering by continuous gravitational drainage. Screw presses are often used for materials that are difficult to press, for example those that tend to pack together. The screw press squeezes the material against a screen or filter and the liquid is collected through the screen for collection and use. History An example of a dewatering press is a wine press. Dating back to Roman times, these machines worked similarly to the modern screw press but possessed some disadvantages which have been corrected and improved within modern presses. The ancient wine press only allowed for grapes to be juiced in batches and often a thick cake would form against the screen, making it difficult for the juice to flow through the screen and be collected for wine. Most modern screw presses allow for a continuous flow of material by surrounding the screw with a screen, which also helps to avoid the build up of a layer of solid material on the screen. One modern approach even removes the screen in favor of a system of fixed and moving rings, which often eliminates solids buildup entirely. The most commonly known screw press of this design is said to have been invented by famous Greek mathematician Archimedes and is known as the screw conveyor. The screw conveyor consists of a shaft, which is surrounded by a spiral steel plate, similar in design and appearance to a corkscrew. This design is used in a multitude of screw presses. There are some machines of this and also of similar design that are not screw presses at all - they do not separate solids from liquids but are instead used to fuse them together. An example of this is a mold-filling machine. Plastic pellets are inserted at one end and heat is applied, melting the pellets and discharging them into a mold. Another example is known as a cooker-extruder and is used in the production of snack foods such as pretzels and more. Design Most screw presses can have dilute materials pumped directly into the screw press, although pre-thickening sometimes improves the performance of the press. This is typically done with a static or sidehill screen, a rotating drum screen, belt press, or a gravity table. Patented in 1900, Valerius Anderson's interrupted flight design is most commonly used as opposed to the continuous flight design. Anderson, upon studying the continuous flight design, noticed that it led to co-rotation and a less efficient job being done dewatering, especially with softer materials. He solved this by putting interruptions on the flights of the screw. The interruptions allowed for the materials to stop moving forward between interruptions along the shaft and also allows for an adequate buildup of the material before it is pushed through the screw press to container that catches the material. This allowed for a better job at the dewatering and a consistent cake material being released. The interrupted flight design screw presses uses were broadened from just soft or mushy materials to include most materials screw presses were used for because unlike the continuous design screw presses the interrupted flight design did not require constant feed or consistency of material. If either were diminished in the continuous design so would production of the dewatered product, in order to avoid this while maintaining the continuous flight design a larger and heavier press with variable speed settings was a necessity; the press also entailed the need of an operator. The interrupted flight design eliminated the need for consistency as the compression of the screw did not change as the material did not progress through the screw until a sufficient amount of the material had formed, as described above. This also eliminates the need for changing speed and an operator. The design allows for self-correction and efficiency that is unavailable with the continuous design. It allowed for a more economically effective screw press that has been used for more than just slimy or slippery materials. After a period of time and its initial patent, resistor teeth were added to the presses where there was no flighting in order to increase the agitation of the materials adding to the limitation of the tendencies of co-rotation within the press Options The buildup of press cake moisture is controlled by a discharge door or cone. Screw presses possess different options that include perforated/slotted screens, a rotating cone, hard surfacing on the screw, and supplemental screen surface in the inlet hopper on the face of the cone. The standard construction for screw presses is of stainless steel with a carbon steel frame on the larger presses. Capacity The specific details of the design of a screw press depend on the material however. The configurations, screw speeds, screens for maximum outlet consistency, including an excellent capture rate vary per material. Most screw presses are designed to feed material that has a 40-60% water make up. The length and diameter ratio of the screw press also depends on the material. The range of the capacity of a screw press Drive Larger presses use a foot-mounted gearbox while smaller presses use a hollow-shaft gearbox. Currently, nearly all presses are driven by electric motors due to their reliable and low cost frequency drives. The electric motors replaced the previously popular hydraulic motor drives. A vertical design was popular in the 1800s through the 1950s but they are no longer made. Most screw presses are currently built with the screws in a horizontal configuration. One newer version uses an angled screw design to reduce floor footprint and press cake moisture. Compressive Mechanisms Compression is created within the screw press by increasing the inner shaft diameter of the screw. For example, if a 16\\" screw press has a 6\\" shaft at the start, the flights on the screw will be 5\\" tall. If this 6\\" shaft diameter is then increased to 12\\" at the discharge, the fights will be only 2\\" tall at this point. Thus compression is applied as the material is being pressed from a 5\\" opening through a 2\\" space. This compression can also be achieved tightening the separation of the flights of the screw. If at the inlet, the pitch is 16\\", the material thus will move 16\\" with each revolution. If it is then decreased to 8\\" at the point of discharge, the material will move 8\\" per revolution. This results in there being more material forced into the press than there is being forced out of the press at a time. This creates the desired compression and pushes the liquid through the screen. Another way to achieve compression is to place a cone at the point of discharge. This can also be called a choke, stopper, or door. In many designs it is bolted into a fixed position, making a fixed, smaller opening which the material must pass through. More commonly found however, the screw press has the cone pushed into the point of discharge via a hydraulic or air cylinder. Specialized types Some other types of presses are vapor-tight presses, and twin-screw presses. Vapor-tight presses are used during the production of soybean protein concentrate (SPC), citrus and apple pectin, bioresin, and Xanthan gum. Twin-screw presses contain two overlapping compression screws. This is more complicated on a mechanical level because the screws must remain synchronized in order for them to work properly. These are often used for slippery materials and feature an internal shredding action. Classification There are two major kinds of screw presses of this design. One type, known as Expellers ¬Æ, removes water from fibrous material, while the other removes free liquid from a material. Expellers Oil expellers are used to squeeze the fat out of soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds, canola (rape seeds), and other oil seeds. The expeller works by exerting extremely high pressures which convert the fat in seeds into a liquid oil. Once the oil is liquefied the oil flows through the screen and is collected. Removal of free liquid Screw presses that are used to free liquid from material are commonly used in the pulp and paper industries, municipal biosolids, septage and grease trap sludge, food production, food waste, manure, and also within the chemical industry. Applications Pulp and paper industries Pulp and paper industries remove water within cellulose fiber. Sewage disposal Biosolids are dewatered and heated through a specific process which includes raising the pH to a level of 12. Septage and grease trap sludge is dewatered with a simple screw press of the above stated design. Nutrient management programs dewater hog and cow manure for sale and commercial use. Food processing Alcohol solutions are squeezed from foods with screw presses (such as soybeans, protein, pectin, and xanthan gum.) Food processing factories use screw presses to separate water from waste streams and convert the solid into animal feeds. For example, sugar beet pulp, orange peel, and spent grain. Fish and orange peel dewatering often provide maximum yield when dewatered within a press of the interrupted flight design and with the addition of steam begin injected into the material. Commonly steam injection holes are drilled into the resistor teeth of the press close to the screw's shaft. PET bottles \\"polyethylene terephthalate\\" is the preferred packaging for soft drinks, fizzy drinks, juice and water. This results in large waste problems. For breweries, large volumes of discharged products need to be destroyed regularly in order to eliminate the risks of the bottles being resold again.

It was directed by Chitrarth Singh and starred Raj Babbar, Rama Vij, Amrish Puri, Kulbhushan Kharbanda and Om Puri. Chann Pardesi was a seminal film that debuted many future Bollywood legends both in front of and behind the camera, and was Raj Babbar's first ever film. Chann Pardesi won India's National Film Award in 1980 and went on to become a big commercial success when it eventually found distribution in 1981. Plot Harnek Singh (a.k.a. Nek) (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) is an honest farm worker from the village who works hard for his employer, Jagirdar Joginder Singh (Amrish Puri). Nek is in love with the village belle, Kammo (Rama Vij), and hopes to marry her after he accumulates enough money and some land. One day the Jagirdar asks his assistant, Tulsi (Om Puri), to send Nek out of the village for a few days. Upon Nek's return home, Joginder is pleased with him and allocates six acres of land so that he can be independent and marry Kammo. A delighted Nek marries Kammo and they settle down to a harmonious married lifestyle. Soon Kammo gives birth to a son, Laali (Raj Babbar). It is then that their world is turned upside down when Nek finds out that the child is not his but that of Joginder, who had raped Kammo in his absence. Angered, Nek kills a man named Kanhaiya, is arrested, tried in Court, and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Nek breaks off all ties with Kammo, suspecting her of infidelity. Years later, grown up Laali is in love with a beautiful girl named Channi (Sunita Dheer), whom he wants to marry. When he tells his mother about this, she refuses to giver her permission and blessings, but instead wants him to marry another village girl Nimmo (Rajni Sharma), whom she approves of. Watch what happens when Laali discovers the reason why his mother does not approve of Channi. Laali brought the money to Jagirdar Joginder Singh for Channi's wedding as Laali considers her like a sister since they are best friends and Tulsi (Om Puri) was going to take the money away before Laali beat up Tulsi and then Joginder fires at Tulsi as his enemy and the terrible secret (of Joginder being Laali's biological father) comes out before Jagirdar goes to jail before Channi's wedding. Harnek Singh (alias Nek) return to the village during Channi's wedding and quit shooting people since Joginder was already in jail and then remain relationship with his wife Kammo and son Laali after 20 years of prison instead of separating his family.

Mapping QTLs is an important activity that plant breeders and geneticists routinely use to associate potential causal genes with phenotypes of interest. Family-based QTL mapping is a variant of QTL mapping where multiple-families are used. Pedigree in humans and wheat Pedigree information include information about ancestry. Keeping pedigree records is a centuries-old tradition. Pedigrees can also be verified using gene-marker data. A complex five generation plant pedigree drawn with Pedimap In plants The method has been discussed in the context of plant breeding populations. Pedigree records are kept by plants breeders and pedigree-based selection is popular in several plant species. Plant pedigrees are different from that of humans, particularly as plant are hermaphroditic ‚Äì an individual can be male or female and mating can be performed in random combinations, with inbreeding loops. Also plant pedigrees may contain of \\"selfs\\", i.e. offspring resulting from self-pollination of a plant.

Limitation of conventional methods  Traditional mapping populations include single family consisting of crossing between two parents or three parents often distantly related. There are some important limitations associated with traditional mapping methods. Some of which include limited polymorphism rates, and no indication of marker effectiveness in multiple genetic backgrounds. Often, by the time a QTL mapping population is developed and mapped, breeders have introgressed the new QTL using traditional breeding and selection methods. This can reduce the usefulness of MAS (marker- assisted selection) within breeding programs at the time when MAS could be most useful (i.e., shortly after new QTL are identified). Family-based QTL mapping removes this limitation by using existing plant breeding families. Example of marker from a single chromosome map segregation in small family pedigree, $ represents null alleles  Common study population mapping  Broadly, there are 3 classes of study designs: study designs in which large sets of relatives from extended or nuclear families are sampled, study designs in which pairs of relatives are sampled (e.g., sibling pairs) or study designs in which unrelated individuals are sampled.  Unrelated individuals  Natural collection of individuals (considered unrelated) with unknown pedigree constitutes mapping populations. The population based association mapping technique are based on this type of populations. In plant context such population are hard to find as most of individuals are someway related. Other disadvantage of such method is that even if we can find such a population, it is difficult to find high allele frequency for allele of interest (usually mutant)in such situation. For purpose of create balance in allele frequency, usually case-control studies. Case control design  Sibpairs  Such design include a pair of sibs from multiple independent families. The members in each sibpairs are not randomly chosen ‚Äì often both siblings are chosen from one tail (upper or lower) of the distribution of the QT (concordant siblings) or one sibling is chosen from the upper tail and the other sibling is chosen from the lower tail (discordant siblings). Another sampling design could include a pair of siblings, one chosen from the upper or lower tail of the distribution and the other chosen randomly from among the remaining siblings. Sib pair example  Trios  Trios include parents and one offspring (most affected). Trios are more commonly used in association studies. The concept of association mapping that each trio are unrelated, however trios are related in themselves. Tios  Nuclear family  Nuclear family consists of two generation simple family pedigree. Nuclear family  Extended pedigrees  In extended pedigree include multiple generation pedigree. It can be as deep or wide as the pedigree information is available. Extended pedigree are attractive for linkage-based analysis. Extended Pedigree example  Linkage vs association analysis  Linkage and association analysis are primary tools for gene discovery, localization and functional analysis. While conceptual underpinning of these approaches have been long known, advances in recent decades in molecular genetics, development in efficient algorithms, and computing power have enabled the large scale application of these methods. While linkage studies seek to identify loci cosegregate with the trait within families, association studies seek to identify particular variants that are associated with the phenotype at the population level. These are complementary methods that, together, provide means to probe the genome and describe etiology of complex traits. In linkage studies, we seek to identify the loci that cosegregate with a specific genomic region, tagged by polymorphic markers, within families. In contrast, in association studies, we seek a correlation between a specific genetic variation and trait variation in sample of individuals, implicating a causal role of the variant.  Family-based linkage analysis  Genetic linkage is the phenomenon where by alleles at different loci cosegregate in families. The strength of cosegregation is measured by the recombination fraction Œ∏, the probability of an odd number of recombination. More complex pedigree provide higher power. Identity by descent (IBD) matrix estimation is a central component in mapping of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) using variance component models. Alleles have identity by type (IBT) when they have the same phenotypic effect. Alleles that are identical by type fall into two groups; those that are identical by descent (IBD) because they arose from the same allele in an earlier generation; and those that are non-identical by descent (NIBD) or identical by state (IBS) because they arose from separate mutations. Parent-offspring pairs share 50% of their genes IBD, and monozygotic twins share 100% IBD. What is relevant in linkage analysis is the inheritance (or coinheritance) of alleles at adjacent loci; therefore; it is critical importance to determine whether the alleles are identical by descent (i.e. copies from same parental alleles) or only identical by state (i.e. appearing same, but derived from two different copies of alleles). Therefore, there three categories of family-based linkage analysis ‚Äì strongly modeled (the traditional lod score model), weakly model based (variance components methods), or model free. Variance component methods may be viewed as hybrids. IBD concept  Family-based association analysis  Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and association mapping is receiving considerable attention in the plant genetics community for its potential to use existing genetic resources collections to fine map quantitative trait loci (QTL), validate candidate genes, and identify alleles of interest (Yu and Buckler, 2006). The three elements of particular importance for conducting association mapping or interpreting the results include: # the analysis of population structure into subgroups, # its use to control for spurious associations and consequences in the specific case of differential selection among subgroups, and # the analysis of the local structure of LD into haplotypes and its consequences on the resolution and the application of LD mapping (Flint-Garcia et al. 2003). In contrast to population-based association, family-based association tests are becoming more popular. The family-based, Tran- disequilibirum test (TDT) has gained wide popularity in recent years, this method also focuses on alleles transmitted to affect offispring, but it is formulated to take account of both the linkage and the disequilibrium that underlie the association. The test requires genotype information on trio individuals, namely affected child and both biological parents; and at least one parent must be heterozygous for the test to be informative. The proposed test statistic is actually McNemar's chi-square statistic and tests the null hypothesis that the putative disease associated allele is transmitted 50% of the time from the heterogygous parents against the alternative hypothesis that the trait positive allele -associated allele will be transmitted more often. The TDT is not affected by population stratification and admixture. The concept of family-based test of association has been extended to quantitative traits. Fundamental Principle of Transmission Disequilibrium test in Trios  Quantitative transmission disequilibrium test (QTDT)  The TDT has been extended in context of quantitative traits and nuclear or extended pedigree families. The generalized test allows to use any family type of families in testing. QTDT has also be been extended to haplotype-based association mapping. Haplotypes refer to combinations of marker alleles which are located closely together on the same chromosome and which tend to be inherited together. With availability of high density SNP makers, haplotypes play an important role in association studies. First ‚Äì haplotypes are critical to understanding the LD pattern across the genome, which is essential for association studies. Actually there is no better way to understand LD pattern than to know the haplotypes themselves. Haplotypes tell us how alleles are organized along the chromosome and reflect the pattern of inheritance over evaluations. Second, methods based on haplotypes can be more powerful than those based on single markers in association studies of mapping complex trait genes.  Drawing family pedigrees  There are several pedigree drawing software available for human genetics context such as COPE (COllaborative Pedigree drawing Environment), CYRILLIC, FTM (Family Tree Maker), FTREE, KINDRED, PED (PEdigree Drawing software),PEDHUNTER, PEDIGRAPH, PEDIGREE/DRAW, PEDIGREE-VISUALIZER, PEDPLOT,PEDRAW/WPEDRAW (Pedigree Drawing/ Window Pedigree Drawing (MS-Window and X-Window version of PEDRAW)), PROGENY (Progeny Software, LLC) etc. However the pedigree drawing in plants requires some additional features such as inbreeding, selfing, mutation, polyploidy etc. which is supported in Pedimap. The pedimap can be used for pedigree visualization along with phenotypic, genotypic and ibd probabilities data in every type of plant pedigrees in both diploids and tetraploids.

History Panic Years was formed by Edward Everett and Amy Miller in Virginia Beach, Virginia in 2008. After forming, they decided to relocate and visited a few cities before deciding on Philadelphia as their favorite. Adam Smith, Amy Miller, Kevin Kurtz & Edward Everett In 2009, the band was chosen by Philadelphia Weekly to perform at the Concerts in the Park series in Rittenhouse Square. In 2010, Panic Years was one of 5 winners of the Musikfest Amped Up competition, earning a chance to perform at the annual music festival in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Later that year, they were chosen as a finalist in the WZZO Backyard Bands competition in Allentown, Pennsylvania. In 2011, the band performed at the Radio 104.5 Summer Block Party, along with The Airborne Toxic Event and The Naked and Famous. \\"Sea Change\\" and \\"Farther\\" have both had radio success and the band has had licensing contracts with MTV and E! to play songs from their first EP on reality shows like \\"The City\\" and \\"Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\\" The band recorded their debut LP, The Month's Mind, in Fall 2011, which was released on June 12, 2012. The band states that large portions of the album were directly influenced by the book Steppenwolf by Hermann Hesse. The band co-produced the album with producer and engineer Mark Padgett, who plays bass in the band Mae. Musical Style The band combines passionate vocals, soft-then-loud transitions, clangy guitars and catchy melodies. WonkaVision Magazine praised the \\"catchy choruses\\" and \\"big riffs\\" on their eponymous debut EP.

Kartar Singh was born to Teja Singh in the Jhabbar village of Sheikhupura District in Punjab (British India). His grandfather Mangal Singh was in the service of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. He received religious education (1906‚Äì09) at the Khalsa Updeshak Mahavidyalaya, a training institution for Sikh preachers at Garjakh. In 1909, Kartar Singh became a preacher and later joined the Singh Sabha Movement. In 1919, he was arrested for anti-Government protests following the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. He was awarded a sentence in the Andaman jail, but was later released after the announcement of the royal clemency. In the 1920s, Kartar Singh led the Gurdwara Reform Movement, which aimed at transferring the control of Sikh gurdwaras from traditional clergy (Udasi mahants) and Government-appointed managers to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). In 1920, a jatha (volunteer group) led by him seized the control of the Babe di Ber gurdwara in Sialkot. He also played an important role in the SGPC's takeover of the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple), the holiest shrine of the Sikhs. He further helped the Akalis seize the control of Gurdwara Panja Sahib (Hasan Abdal, November 1920), Gurdwara Sacha Sauda (Chuhar Kana, December 1920), Gurdwara Sri Tarn Taran Sahib (January 1921) and Gurdwara Guru ka Bagh (near Amritsar, January 1921). In 1921, Kartar Singh was arrested for protesting against the Nankana massacre, and again in 1924 for taking part in various Akali movement demonstrations. He was released in December 1928, because of poor health. He and his associates were involved in securing for SGPC the possession of properties attached to various gurdwaras, in accordance with the Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925. After the partition of India in 1947, Kartar Singh migrated to Habri village of Karnal district (in present day Kaithal district of Haryana). He was engaged in resettlement of refugees, and died in Habri, in 1962.

She came from a strong Methodist family and upon leaving Ireland, became part of the Methodist Missionary Society. When she arrived in China, Wolfe joined the Jubilee Women's hospital at the Wesleyan Mission in Hankow, where she worked among other European missionaries and ran Bible classes for women and children. Wolfe's time in China was marked by much political strife, as she arrived four years after the Chinese Revolution of 1911 and witnessed the Chinese Civil War, which began in 1927. In 1951, after serving the Chinese people for nearly forty years, Sally Wolfe left China due to strong xenophobia towards foreign missionaries and conflict between Communists and the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party). Early life and education Sally Wolfe was born on Christmas Day, 1885 to John Joseph and Marion Wolfe in Ireland. She was the second child and eldest daughter among her five siblings. During her early childhood, Wolfe's family moved from their home to The Grove, a house on the outskirts of Skibbereen (County Cork, Ireland) that once belonged to her maternal grandmother. There, the Wolfes lived a relatively comfortable life and had close ties with the Methodist Church, as John Joseph and Marion were both raised in heavily Methodist families. As a child, Wolfe attended the Ladies‚Äô School in Skibbereen and later attended Mr. Storey's Intermediate School. After entering and graduating from Alexandra College in Dublin, Ireland, Wolfe attended University College Cork in 1908 to study medicine with the intention of becoming a medical missionary. While she was there, she was honored for her academic achievements, as she earned the titles of First Exhibitioner in Science (1907-1908) and Second Year Exhibitioner (1909) and was honored with fourth and fifth year scholarships of ¬£28 and ¬£30, respectively. Wolfe graduated from Cork University in 1913 and subsequently began working at the Royal Samaritan Hospital in Glasgow, Scotland. There, she was appointed resident house surgeon in 1913 and ultimately, in June 1913, was promoted to a paid position under a surgeon named Dr. A.W. Russell. Due to differences and dissatisfaction with the Royal Samaritan Hospital and Dr. Russell in particular, Wolfe resigned from her position at the hospital on November 30, 1913. Work in China Around April 1915, Wolfe moved to China in response to what she believed was God's calling for her to become a medical missionary. In concordance with a promise she made her father, she waited until she was thirty before leaving for China. Upon arriving in the country, Wolfe worked in Jubilee Women's Hospital (affiliated with the English Wesleyan Mission) in Hankow. There, she worked with other European women as well as Chinese nurses and treated conditions such as lockjaw, cholera, malnutrition, while also serving as an obstetrician and surgeon. In addition to working in the hospital, Wolfe made house calls throughout the Chinese countryside in order to unbind young girls‚Äô feet, as foot binding was considered a sign of beauty and necessary for marriage.Louisa Lim, \\"Painful Memories for China's Footbinding Survivors,\\" NPR, 2007 March 19, https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=8966942, Retrieved 2011 December 19 In addition to working at Jubilee Women's Hospital, Wolfe also spent time in Chungsiang, where she worked in an outpatient department around 1931; she also worked in Hway Chin Tiang, where she helped provide medical care for destitute women and children and in 1937, worked at Methodist General Hospital in Chungsiang. While as a medical missionary in China, Wolfe intermittently took four furloughs, which took place in 1921-1922, 1927, 1934-1935, and 1941. During her time in China, Wolfe was highly regarded by her Chinese colleagues, who presented her with scrolls reading ‚Äú‚ÄôShe healed the entire globe and jewels are made more precious by her virtue,‚Äô‚Äù and ‚Äú‚ÄôHer name is known throughout China and foreign countries and her virtue enriches gold.‚Äù‚Äô (Wright 120) In his book entitled, China, My China, Harold B. Rattenbury also lauds Wolfe, as he recalls seeing her in the Women‚Äôs Hospital across the street from his Hankow home.Harold B. Rattenbury, China, My China, Frederick Muller Ltd., 1944 Rattenbury praises her work ethic, saying, ‚ÄúWhen or how that doctor slept I never could discover. She seemed to be on call at all hours of the day and night‚Ä¶‚Äù (120) Rattenbury also speaks highly of Wolfe's character, calling her ‚Äúbrilliant, sincere, straight, and childlike,‚Äù while depicting her as a heroic presence in China and emphasizing her love and understanding of the Chinese people. Ultimately, Wolfe applied for an exit permit and left China in 1951 after deciding that her presence was doing more harm than good; she and other foreign missionaries collectively felt that their affiliation with the Chinese Christians placed the Chinese Church in Communist disfavor, and therefore, danger. Political context During her time in China, Wolfe witnessed significant political turmoil, as she arrived four years after the Chinese Revolution of 1911. Also known as the Xinhai Revolution, the event resulted in the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty by revolutionaries and the subsequent establishment of the Republic of China.Milestones: 1899-1913: The Chinese Revolution of 1911, U.S. Department of State: Office of the Historian, Retrieved 2011 December 19 Because of the political disorder in China, Wolfe at times, lived in significant danger and endured various life-threatening situations. During Wolfe's stay in Cheungsiang in 1931, for instance, one of Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs armies attacked the region and killed several of Wolfe's colleagues. During the same instance, a red soldier searched the home in which Wolfe was a guest, but failed to see her. The day after Wolfe left the residence, the house was searched thoroughly. In another instance, Wolfe was brought before a firing squad, presumably of the Communist Party. According to Wolfe, a member of the squad saved her life by coming forward and saying that she had once cared for him and therefore, should not die. Overall, Wolfe stayed in China throughout four stages of conflict, as she witnessed the control of China by various warlords during the Warlord Era, war between the Communists and Kuomintang, a combined effort by the Communists and Kuomintang against Japan during World War II, and resumed civil war between the Communists and Kuomintang after World War II. Adopting children While in China, Wolfe adopted three Chinese children. Suteh, Wolfe's oldest daughter, was adopted around early January 1925 after Suteh's biological mother and leader in Wolfe's Bible group died after childbirth. Shortly after adopting Suteh, Wolfe's adopted a second child, a boy named Johan, whose biological mother, also a Bible woman, died during childbirth. About three years after adopting Johan, Wolfe adopted her third child, a daughter named Futeh, whose biological parents deserted her. After Wolfe's departure from China in 1951, she never heard from or about her children again, as the Communists in power stopped letters from being sent to the West. Religious work While working as a medical missionary, Wolfe remained grounded in her Methodist beliefs and led a Bible group in Hankow, a weekly prayer meeting, and taught Sunday school in Hway Chin Tiang. Post- China life After leaving China in 1951, Wolfe spent a year in Dublin in the home of Betty, her eldest niece. When Betty's family moved to Kenya, Wolfe moved to and stayed in Canada until 1957. While in Canada, she worked along the Alberta-Saskatchewan border at Cold Lake Hospital for a summer and occasionally helped run Hollandia House, a nursing home in Elk Point, Alberta. While at her youngest brother Tom's house in Elk Point, however, Wolfe fell and broke her hip; after a young surgeon erred in the setting of Wolfe's hip, she was left with limited function in one her legs. In 1975, Wolfe left Canada and moved back to Cork, as she wished to die in her native land. After living in a flat next to her sister Fan and subsequently living with her cousin Marie Kingston, Wolfe eventually moved into St. Luke's Home in Cork. There, Wolfe fell, broke her hip again, and consequently, became bedridden. Wolfe died on July 15, 1975, at the age of ninety.

The specification is also referred to as the USB 3.0 host controller specification. xHCI improves on the pre-existing Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) and the Universal Host Controller Interface (UHCI) architectures most prominently in handling a wider range of speeds within a single standard, in managing resources more efficiently for the benefit of mobile hosts with limited power resources (such as tablets and cell phones), and in simplifying support for mixing of low-speed and high-speed devices.  Architectural goals  The xHCI is a radical break from the previous generations of USB host controller interface architectures (i.e. the Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI), the Universal Host Controller Interface (UHCI), and the Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI)) on many counts. Following are the key goals of the xHCI architecture: * Efficient operation ‚Äì idle power and performance better than legacy USB host controller architectures. * A device level programming model that is fully consistent with the existing USB software model * Decouple the host controller interface presented to software from the underlying USB protocols * Minimize host memory accesses, fully eliminating them when USB devices are idle * Eliminate register writes and minimize register reads for normal data transfers * Eliminate the \\"Companion Controller\\" model * Enable hardware \\"fail-over\\" modes in system resource constrained situations so devices are still accessible, but perhaps at less optimal power/performance point * Provide the ability for different markets to differentiate hardware capabilities, e.g. target host controller power, performance and cost trade-offs for specific markets * Define an extensible architecture that provides an easy path for new USB specifications and technologies, such as higher bandwidth interfaces, optical transmission medium, etc., without requiring the definition of yet another USB host controller interface  Architectural details   Support for all speeds  The OHCI and UHCI controllers support only USB 1 speed devices (1.5 Mbit/s and 12 Mbit/s), and the EHCI only supports USB 2 devices (480 Mbit/s). The xHCI architecture was designed to support all USB speeds, including SuperSpeed (5 Gbit/s) and future speeds, under a single driver stack.  Power efficiency  When USB was originally developed in 1995, it was targeted at desktop platforms to stem the proliferation of connectors that were appearing on PCs, e.g. PS/2, serial port, parallel port, Game Port, etc., and host power consumption was not an important consideration at the time. Since then, mobile platforms have become the platform of choice, and their batteries have made power consumption a key consideration. The architectures of the legacy USB host controllers (OHCI, UHCI, and EHCI) were very similar in that the \\"schedule\\" for the transactions to be performed on the USB were built by software in host memory, and the host controller hardware would continuously read the schedules to determine what transactions needed to be driven on the USB, and when, even if no data was moved. Additionally, in the case of reads from the device, the device was polled each schedule interval, even if there was no data to read. * The xHCI eliminates host memory based USB transaction schedules, enabling zero host memory activity when there is no USB data movement. * The xHCI reduces the need for periodic device polling by allowing a USB 3.0 or later device to notify the host controller when it has data available to read, and moves the management of polling USB 2.0 and 1.1 devices that use interrupt transactions from the CPU-driven USB driver to the USB host controller. EHCI, OHCI, and UHCI host controllers would automatically handle polling for the CPU if there are no changes that need to be made and if no device has any interrupts to send but they all rely on the CPU to set the schedule up for the controllers. If any USB device using interrupt transactions does have data to send, then an xHCI host controller will send an interrupt to notify the CPU that there is a USB interrupt transaction that needs handling. Since the CPU no longer has to manage the polling of the USB bus, it can spend more time in low power states. * The xHCI does not require that implementations provide support for all advanced USB 2 and 3 power management features, including USB 2 LPM, USB 3 U1 and U2 states, HERD, LTM, Function Wake, etc.; but these features are required to realize all of the advantages of xHCI.  Virtualization support  Legacy USB host-controller architectures exhibit some serious shortcomings when applied to virtualized environments. Legacy USB host-controller interfaces define a relatively simple hardware data-pump; where critical state related to overall bus-management (bandwidth allocation, address assignment, etc.) resides in the software of the host-controller driver (HCD). Trying to apply the standard hardware IO virtualization technique - replicating I/O interface registers - to the legacy USB host controller interface is problematic because critical state that must be managed across virtual machines (VMs) is not available to hardware. The xHCI architecture moves the control of this critical state into hardware, enabling USB resource management across VMs. The xHCI virtualization features also provide for: * direct-Assignment of individual USB devices (irrespective of their location in the bus topology) to any VM * minimizing run-time inter- VM communications * support for native USB device-sharing * support of PCIe SR-IOV (single root I/O virtualization)  Simplified driver architecture  The EHCI utilizes OHCI or UHCI controllers as \\"companion controllers\\", where USB 2 devices are managed through the EHCI stack, and the port logic of the EHCI allows a low-speed or full-speed USB device to be routed to a port of a \\"companion\\" UHCI or OHCI controller, where the low-speed or full-speed USB devices are managed through the respective UHCI or OHCI stack. For example, a USB 2 PCIe host controller card that presents 4 USB \\"Standard A\\" connectors typically presents one 4-port EHCI and two 2-port OHCI controllers to system software. When a high-speed USB device is attached to any of the 4 connectors, the device is managed through one of the 4 root hub ports of the EHCI controller. If a low-speed or full-speed USB device is attached to connectors 1 or 2, it will be routed to the root hub ports of one of the OHCI controllers for management, and low-speed and full-speed USB devices attached to connectors 3 or 4 will be routed to the root hub ports of the other OHCI controller. The EHCI dependence on separate host controllers for high-speed USB devices and the group of low-speed and full-speed USB devices results in complex interactions and dependencies between the EHCI and OHCI/UHCI drivers. * The xHCI architecture eliminates the need for companion controllers and their separate driver stacks. * The incorporation of the schedule, bandwidth management, and USB device address assignment functions, that were previously performed by the driver in to the xHCI hardware enable a simpler, leaner, lower latency software stack for the xHCI.  Stream support  Support for Streams was added to the USB 3.0 SuperSpeed specification, primarily to enable high performance storage operations over USB. Classically there has been a 1:1 relationship between a USB endpoint and a buffer in system memory, and the host controller solely responsible for directing all data transfers. Streams changed this paradigm by providing a 1-to-many \\"endpoint to buffer\\" association, and allowing the device to direct the host controller as to which buffer to move. The USB data transfers associated with a USB Stream endpoint are scheduled by the xHCI the same as any other bulk endpoint is, however the data buffer associated with a transfer is determined by the device. * The xHCI USB Stream support allows up to 64K buffers to be associated with a single endpoint. * The xHCI Streams protocol support allows a USB device to select which buffer that the xHCI will transfer when the endpoint is scheduled.  Scalability  The xHCI architecture was designed to be highly scalable, capable of supporting 1 to 255 USB devices and 1 to 255 root hub ports. Since each USB device is allowed to define up to 31 endpoints, an xHCI that supported 255 devices would have to support 7,906 separate total endpoints. Classically, each memory buffer associated with an endpoint is described by a queue of physical memory blocks, where the queue requires a head pointer, tail pointer, length and other registers to define its state. There are many ways to define queue state, however if one were to assume 32 bytes of register space for each queue, then almost a 256KB of register space would be required to support 7,906 queues. Typically only a small number of USB devices are attached to a system at one time, and on the average a USB device supports 3-4 endpoints, of which only a subset of the endpoints are active at the same time. The xHCI maintains queue state in system memory as Endpoint Context data structures. The contexts are designed so that they can be cached by the xHCI, and \\"paged\\" in and out as a function of endpoint activity. Thus a vendor can scale their internal xHCI Endpoint Context cache space and resources to match the practical usage models expected for their products, rather than the architectural limits that they support. Ideally the internal cache space is selected so that under normal usage conditions, there is no context paging by the xHCI. Also USB endpoint activity tends to be bursty. That is, at any point in time a large number of endpoints may be ready to move data, however only a subset are actively moving data. For instance, the interrupt IN endpoint of a mouse may not transfer data for hours if the user is away from their desk. xHCI vendor specific algorithms could detect this condition and make that endpoint a candidate for paging out if other endpoints become busy. * The xHCI architecture allows large maximum values for the number of USB devices, ports, interrupt vectors, etc. supported, however an implementation only needs to define the number necessary to meet its marketing requirements. For instance, a vendor could choose to limit the number of USB devices that it supported for a tablet xHCI implementation to 16 devices. * A vendor can further take advantage of xHCI architectural features to scale its internal resources to match its target usage models. For instance, if through usability testing a vendor determines that 95% of tablet users will never connect more than 4 USB devices, and each USB device typically defines 4 endpoints (or less), then internal caching for 16 Endpoint Contexts will ensure that under normal conditions there will be no system memory activity due to Endpoint Context paging.  History  The Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) specification was defined by a consortium of companies (Compaq, Microsoft, and National Semiconductor) as open specification to support USB 1.0 devices. The Universal Host Controller Interface (UHCI) refers to a specification that Intel originally defined as a proprietary interface to support USB 1.0 devices. The UHCI specification was eventually made public, but only after the rest of industry had adopted the OHCI specification. The EHCI specification was defined by Intel to support USB 2.0 devices. The EHCI architecture was modeled after the UHCI and OHCI controllers, which required software to build the USB transaction schedules in memory, and to manage bandwidth and address allocation. To eliminate a redundant industry effort of defining an open version of a USB 2.0 host controller interface, Intel made the EHCI specification available to the industry with no licensing fees. The EHCI licensing model was continued for Intel's xHCI specification, however with a greatly expanded industry contribution. Over 100 companies have contributed to the xHCI specification. The USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) has also funded a set of xHCI Compliance Tests to maximize the compatibility of the various xHCI implementations. xHCI 1.0 controllers have been shipping since December 2009. Linux kernels since 2009 contain xHCI drivers, but for older kernels there are drivers available online. Windows drivers for XP, Vista, and Windows 7 are available from the respective xHCI vendors. xHCI drivers for embedded system are available from MCCI, Jungo, and other software vendors. xHCI IP blocks are also available from several vendors for customization in SOC environments. xHCI 1.1 controllers and devices began shipping in 2015.  Version history  The xHCI specification uses \\"errata\\" files to define updates and clarifications to a specific release. The changes in the errata files are accumulated in each release. Refer to the associated errata files for the details of specific changes. Most changes defined in the xHCI errata files are clarifications, grammatical or spelling corrections, additional cross- references, etc., which do not affect a driver implementation. Changes that are determined to be architectural utilize a Capability flag to determine whether a particular feature is supported by an xHCI implementation, and an Enable flag to turn on the feature. = Prereleases = The xHCI specification evolved through several versions before its official release in 2010: * xHCI 0.9: Released in August 2008. * USB 0.95: Released in December 2008. * USB 0.96: Released in August 2009. * USB 0.96a: 1.0 Release Candidate, Released in April 2010.

He works at the intersection of sociology, economics, and political science, focusing in particular on inequalities in the distribution of economic resources such as income and time and how private and public conventions and institutions shape these inequalities. In 2009 he was awarded the Stein Rokkan Prize for Comparative Social Science Research. Early life Rice was born in 1972 in Honolulu, Hawaii. His mother was a Minangkabau woman from Medan, North Sumatra. His father, who was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was an economist who taught economics at the University of Hawaii and Monash University, in addition to conducting a large number of consultancies in Indonesia. Research Domestic technology and household work Research by Michael Bittman, James Mahmud Rice, and Judy Wajcman has shown that domestic appliances which are designed to make our lives easier do not reduce the overall time spent doing housework, and in some cases may even increase the time spent doing chores. \\"The authors ... believe that people use the devices simply to achieve ever-higher standards of cleanliness and refinement in their home, rather than to free up time for other pursuits,\\" according to John Elliott in The Sunday Times. The results of this research received wide press coverage in Australia and the United Kingdom. Temporal autonomy and discretionary time Discretionary Time: A New Measure of Freedom by Robert E. Goodin, James Mahmud Rice, Antti Parpo, and Lina Eriksson was published by Cambridge University Press in 2008. It is based on the authors' analysis of data from the United States, Australia, Germany, France, Sweden, and Finland. The authors propose that temporal autonomy can be used as an indicator of freedom, which is measured by how many hours people are free to do as they please. They then explore how much temporal autonomy people could have under alternative welfare, gender, and household arrangements. Another one of their statements is that the richer an individual is, the more he or she feels stressed. However, they argue, a richer individual's prosperity could be part of the problem. An example is that a banker who earns ¬£200 per hour has a greater opportunity cost by choosing not to work, than a cleaner who earns only ¬£10 per hour. As a result, the banker may feel compelled to work a greater number of hours than the cleaner does, despite making a greater total income. Low fertility and standards of living How low fertility influences standards of living is examined in research published in Science by Ronald Lee, Andrew Mason, James Mahmud Rice, and other members of the National Transfer Accounts Network. This research indicates, on the basis of an analysis of data from 40 countries, that fertility well above replacement and population growth would typically be most beneficial for government budgets. However, fertility near replacement and population stability would be most beneficial for standards of living when the analysis includes the effects of age structure on families as well as governments. Fertility moderately below replacement and population decline would maximize standards of living when the cost of providing capital for a growing labour force is taken into account. Awards and honours In 2009 Rice was awarded the Stein Rokkan Prize for Comparative Social Science Research, together with Robert E. Goodin, Antti Parpo, and Lina Eriksson.

Plot  The story is centered on a family of five, a father, mother, their two sons, and daughter, revolving around the father. The reality within the diegesis is the one of the father, Leonardo. The film plays with chronology and reality. Leonardo is a well-known writer and playwright, whose his wife left university studies to take care of the family. The film begins with a scene of a dinner in which Leonardo seems uncomfortable because, as is learned later in the film, he is witnessing a possible affair between his wife and an old college friend of hers. The film documents the troubles of the marriage as Leonardo has a brief affair with his dentist shortly after his youngest daughter leaves to Israel with her new husband Ianib. Leonardo's version of reality is, at many times, questionable during the film. He talks to a doctor that researches memory and they talk about the construction of memory and fantasy and it alludes to the self-reflexivity of the film. Leonardo's son in law Ianib leaves behind a book for him to read and asks for his opinion of it. Leonardo takes some time to actually read the book even though he carries it around for most of the film. When he finally reads the book, he is surprised to find out that it is brilliant. This scene is accompanied with a distinct use of lighting that focuses on Leonardo and his absorption within the novel. The question of anti- Semitism is brought up in the film. Leonardo is questioned by one of his colleagues after a cartoon that he created is looked down upon as an anti- Semitic caricature of the Jewish people. Leonardo responds by saying, ‚ÄúMe, anti-Semitic? My daughter married an Israeli‚Äù. Leonardo takes his colleague's remarks quite lightly and soon travels to Israel with his wife to visit their daughter. It is during almost the end of the film that the viewer meets Julia and Ianib. Ianib wins a prestigious award for his novel and this serves as a bonding experience between the father and the Jewish son-in-law. Tensions that were built upon during most of the film are released with the time that Leonardo and Ianib spend together in Ianib's home country. Talk of children comes up during dinner and possible circumcision is mentioned. Ianib and Leonardo find something in common with each other, and while it may not be religion or language, it is their passion for writing. Ianib tells Leonardo, when his memory is questioned by Martha and Julia, ‚ÄúFamily stories are always true‚Äù. The film closes with shots of the landscapes of Israel and a bonding moment between Martha and Leonardo before playing with chronological order once more, going back in time, to offer a scene with Leonardo and Julia talking after she comes home from a date with Ianib.

(see Esoteric Culture, Issue 2, Robert Koenig) Peter had a recording contract at the age of sixteen with the Pell Brothers whom he refers to as \\"Brooklyn hillbillies\\". They wrote the music; he wrote the lyrics. Grudzien and his twin sister Theresa Lewis (died c.2005-07) were paranoid schizophrenics. Grudzien was a patient at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center for eight months in the 1960s, where he received electroconvulsive therapy. He was tremendously influenced by Johnny Cash, whom he met briefly. Although he had his picture taken with Cash they did not otherwise meet and never played together. In the 1960s and 70s Grudzien was active in the Greenwich Village folk/bluegrass scene, which included artists such as John Herald, Peter Stampfel, and Phil White. Grudzien's LP, The Unicorn, was released in 1974.http://www.filmcement.org/rummage/archives/000004.html Grudzien had 500 copies pressed and tried, unsuccessfully, to sell them in bookstores. The album was almost entirely written, played, and produced by Grudzien except for the piano intro in \\"The Innocents\\", transcribed by a friend whose name he has forgotten (see Koenig). The Unicorn was re-released on CD by Parallel World in 1995. The CD release of The Unicorn also included several new songs by Grudzien, including his take on the American standard, \\"There's a Star Spangled Banner Waving Somewhere\\", updated with many openly gay sentiments. According to Grudzien's associate Barbara Zigman, Grudzien did not receive any royalties from Parallel World for the CD reissue. According to the label owners, the CD never sold enough to recoup the reproduction costs (which were very high because of the poor condition of the master tapes), and as per the lease agreement, was not required to dispense any royalties until such costs were recouped. An advance had been offered, which Grudzien turned down. Late in his life, Grudzien still occasionally performed in the New York area. He recorded extensively, mostly for friends. Several post-Unicorn tapes and CDs were released but are not generally available. However, he released a cover of Malvina Reynolds's \\"Little Boxes\\" for Bob Koenig's Abbey Lane CD. In 2018, a documentary about Peter and his family, The Unicorn, was released. According to director Isabelle DuPuis, Grudzien's friends are trying to release some of his later music.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7542928/?ref_=nv_sr_7https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/unicorn- wins-buenos-aires-film- festival-1201873https://www.theunicornfilm.com/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8506223/the- unicorn-documentary-peter-grudzienhttps://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review- the-unicorn-captures-the-intersection-between-art-and-the- quotidian/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/movies/the-unicorn-review.html References 1941 births 2013 deaths Outsider musicians Gay musicians American country singer-songwriters LGBT musicians from the United States ","title":"Peter Grudzien"},{"id":"34133410","text":"The Adorable Deceiver is a lostThe Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog:..The Adorable Deceiver Retrieved June 27, 2016 1926 American silent film comedy, starring Alberta Vaughn as a princess, forced to flee her home country with her father King Nicholas to New York City, where they make their way as well-meaning con artists.The AFI Catalog of Feature Films: The Adorable Deceiver  Cast  * Alberta Vaughn as Princess Sylvia * Daniel Makarenko as King Nicholas * Harland Tucker as Tom Pettibone * Frank Leigh as Jim Doyle * Jane Thomas (actor) as Flo Doyle * Cora Williams as Mrs. Pettibone * Rosa Gore as Mrs. Schrapp * Sheila Hayward as Bellona References External links  1926 films American films American silent feature films American black-and-white films Film Booking Offices of America films 1926 comedy films American comedy films Lost American films 1926 lost films Lost comedy films ","title":"The Adorable Deceiver"},{"id":"34133415","text":"This is a list of rappers from Houston. * 5th Ward Boyz * 5th Ward Juvenilez * ABN * Ameer Vann * Baby Bash * Big Hawk * Big Mello * Big Mike * Big Moe * Big Pokey * Blac Monks * Boss Hogg Outlawz * Boston George * Botany Boyz * Bun B * Bushwick Bill * C-Note * Chamillionaire * Chedda Da Connect * Chingo Bling * Choice * Coughee Brothaz * Crime Boss * Deep * Devin the Dude * DJ Premier * DJ Screw * Don Toliver * Doughbeezy * E.S.G. * Expensive Taste * Fat Pat * Fat Tony * Ganksta N-I-P * Gemini * Geto Boys * Hyro Da Hero * Juan Gotti * Killa Kyleon * Kirko Bangz * LE$ * Lecrae * Lil' Flip * Lil' Jay Harden * Lil' Keke * Lil' O * Lil' Troy * L.R.B. * Lucky Luciano * Maxo Kream * Megan Thee Stallion * Mike Jones * Mr. Mike * OG Ron C * O.G.

Michael Baius, professor of theology and rector. Cornelius Jansen, professor of theology and rector. Febronius, former student at the Theological Faculty of Louvain. Pope Adrian VI, former professor of the university Jacobus Latomus The Old University of Leuven was established in 1425 with Faculties of Arts, Medicine, Law; however, the university did not have a Faculty of Theology initially. In 1426 a Faculty of Canon Law was added, and at that time both Law Faculties functioned together in one Collegium utriusque iuris. History During the Middle Ages, a studium generale was often rounded out after a short time with the foundation of a Faculty of Theology. After repeated requests from the municipal government, from the Duke of Brabant and from Philip the Good, the university received permission to grant theological degrees from Pope Eugene IV on 7 March 1432. Professors for the new faculty were first recruited from already existing theological faculties, particularly those of the University of Paris and the University of Cologne. Instruction in the old faculty of theology was thus closely based on the theological developments of these sister faculties. Students wishing to earn the degree of Sacrae Theologiae Licentiatus were taught and required to comment upon the Scriptures and Peter Lombard‚Äôs Book of Sentences, and they took part in disputations that were a typical part of medieval university education. The most famous theologian from the 15th century faculty was Adrian Floriszoon of Utrecht. He taught in Leuven from 1491 to 1515 and later became Pope Adrian VI. Throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Adrian's successors made a name for themselves by resourcing theology through a renewed study of Augustine. The Leuven Faculty and its magisters anticipated several of the theological trends that emerged in their time. An example of this is seen in Jacobus Latomus‚Äôs De trium linguarum et studii theologici ratione dialogus, which was published in 1519 as a response to the challenge posed by the work of Desiderius Erasmus, who was active at the Collegium Trilingue in Leuven. Later theologians such as Johannes Driedo also strongly opposed Erasmian thought, saying it was a contemporary brand of Pelagianism. At the same time, the faculty also opposed Martin Luther‚Äôs thought, by refuting his early writings in a censure published on 7 November 1519. Ruard Tapper, another Leuven theologian, led the controversy by drawing up a summary of the Catholic position in 59 articles, later reduced to 39 articles. On top of this, Leuven's Theological Faculty also played an active role during the Council of Trent. Among the delegates to the Council were several of its professors, including theologians like Tapper, Johannes Hesselius, and Michael Baius. In addition, Johannes Driedo's works were influential and circulated among the Tridentine Council Fathers. In 1546 two Royal Chairs were granted to the faculty by Charles V, in addition to the five already existing chairs. One of these new chairs was dedicated to the study of Scripture. A characteristic of this period was the transition the Leuven faculty made from a scholastic theology to a more positive theology based on Scripture and the Church Fathers. A specific brand of Leuven Augustinianism developed in this context, and characterized the faculty and its theology throughout the eighteenth century, thus allowing the faculty to procure its own position within the Counter-Reformation. Here the faculty set the tone by publishing an Index of Forbidden Books (1546, reworked in 1550). This Index was the first of its kind and served as a model for the later Roman Index librorum prohibitorum published in 1559 by Pope Paul IV. In 1547 the faculty published a new version of the Vulgate, which was submitted to better revisions. This new translation was used by the committee charged with preparing an official edition of the Vulgate in the seventeenth century under the authority of Pope Paul V. The faculty's growing scientific specialization was manifest in the publishing of two major works: the six language Biblia Polyglotta (1568‚Äì1572) and a new edition of the complete works of Augustine, supervised by Johannes Molanus (1576‚Äì1577) and published by Christoffel Plantijn (publisher of the Polyglot Bible, which is in exposition at the Plantijn-Moretus Museum in Antwerp). The emphasis on Augustinus in theology took its most extreme form in Leuven in the teaching of Michael Baius. This theology focused on Augustine's thought regarding grace and creation, and it produced an extremely negative view of humanity in its fallen state. In this respect, Baius shared Reformation ideas, while flatly opposing the idea of sacramental restoration of humanity from this state. Baius‚Äô work was condemned by the theological faculties in Salamanca (1565) and Alcal√° (1567), and 97 of his theses were thereafter condemned by Pope Pius V in the bull Ex omnibus afflictionibus on 1 October 1567. A new condemnation was given in 1580 by Pope Gregory XIII in his papal bull Provisionis Nostrae. Baius‚Äô work was also later contested by Jesuit theologians such as Leonardus Lessius and Robert Bellarmine. However, despite all of this opposition against Baianism, the Leuven professor regius became Inquisitor General. Later, in the twentieth century, theologians such as Henri de Lubac ‚Äì in his famous book Surnaturel of 1946 ‚Äì revived the discussion on the value of Baius' theological opinions. Another famous exponent of Leuven Augustinianism was Cornelius Jansen, after whom Jansenism is named. After studying at the University of Utrecht and Leuven, Jansenius withdrew to France, where he applied himself to an intensive study of the Scriptures and the Church Fathers. He worked together with his friend Jean Duvergier de Hauranne who later became the abb√© of Saint-Cyran. Jansenius studied the original sources rather than concentrating upon scholastic subtleties in a debate over the ground and efficacy of grace precisely as Pope Clement VIII had demanded. Jansenius‚Äô study of Augustine of Hippo‚Äôs thought cost many years of work as is reflected in his book Augustinus, which was published posthumously in 1640. Jansenius‚Äô work was attacked by the Societas Jesu in particular, but it had other opponents as well, such as the Protestant theologian Gisbertus Voetius. Through the Jesuit's efforts the Augustinus was condemned in 1642. Nevertheless, the work had its defenders, among who was the French monastery at Port-Royal-des- Champs. Blaise Pascal and Antoine Arnauld were the best known of the defenders of Jansenius' work, who also brought moral questions into the debate. Five of Jansenius' Augustinus‚Äô theses were condemned by Pope Innocent X in 1653. But, in reaction, Arnauld cum suis disputed the idea that these theses could as such be found in Jansenius‚Äô writings. In 1656 Pope Alexander VII declared that the theses, exactly as they had been condemned, were in fact precisely what Jansenius had meant. Then, only after Alexander VII's death a compromise was made under Pope Clement IX. Tensions between the Leuven Faculty and the Jesuit Order heated up due in part to the fact that the Leuven faculty presented a list of propositions in 1653 and 1657 for condemnation, aimed against the Jesuits, claiming that they represented a theological laxism. Between 1677 and 1679, the faculty obtained the condemnation, through Pope Innocent XI, of 65 theses drawn from the writings of Jesuit moral theologians. The Jesuits in their turn obtained a condemnation of 31 rigorist propositions allegedly taught by the Leuven professors in 1713. The Jansenist controversy finally ended with the promulgation of the papal bull Unigenitus in 1713. After professors like Martin Steyaert turned to the Roman point of view, the entire faculty subjected itself to this position. The faculty became more conciliatory toward the central doctrinal authority in the eighteenth century, becoming a center of Ultramontanism through its dismissal of Gallicanism and Febronianism. The faculty's reputation was strengthened by its opposition to Joseph II of Austria's religious politics and to the vows imposed on clerics by the French Republic. After the French Revolutionary Wars, by the Treaty of Campo Formio, the Austrian Netherlands was ceded to the French Republic by Austria in exchange for the Republic of Venice. Once integrated into the French Republic, a law dating to 1793 mandating that all universities in France be closed came into effect.The law of 15 September 1793 had decreed the suppression of all the colleges and universities in France, but the universities remain de facto until the new law of 7 vent√¥se year III (25 February 1795) creating the √âcoles Centrales. In accordance with this law the University of Louvain was abolished by Decree of the Departement of the Dijle.

It was named in honor of Luke the Evangelist, who is the patron saint of doctors in the Roman Catholic religion. History H√¥pital Saint-Luc was founded in 1908 by Dr. F.A. Fleury in a private home at 88 Saint Denis Street, Montreal. The hospital was located in the poorest neighborhood of Montreal. The founder, Dr. F. A. Fleury wanted to treat children in need. H√¥pital Saint-Luc had a mission to accept, without any discrimination, any person requiring care.http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/sante/201710/08/01-5139313-la-fin-de- saint-luc-lhopital-du-peuple.php In 1912, hospital officials required the assistance of the City of Montreal to pay the salaries of its dentists. During the years of Great Depression following the 1929 stock market crash, agreements with the city provided a number of beds to be constantly available to the homeless patients collected by the police in addition to both domestic and foreign sailors from the Port of Montreal. In exchange, the city and the Government of Canada compensated the hospital for each visit or hospitalization. These new modes of cooperation were precursors to universal access to medical care. H√¥pital Saint-Luc was notably the first hospital to offer 24-hour emergency services regardless of ethnic, linguistic or religious identity. The hospital was specialized since its founding in the fields of Otolaryngology, Ophthalmology, dentistry and clinical venereal disease. Over the years, the need for hospitalization become increasingly urgent. In 1928 the small hospital was inaugurated, increasing the capacity from 9 to 89 beds. A chain of successive expansions took place thereafter, allowing H√¥pital Saint-Luc to offer a total of 814 beds.

Seiji Ozawa conducted the world premiere with the BSO on 26 February 1981 at Symphony Hall, Boston. Character and materials The symphony is in B minor, though the key does not figure in the title and the tonality is not entirely conventional. It has been characterised as \\"focused atonality ‚Ä¶ a new tonality without neo-classicism\\" . For example, instead of the usual dominant, F, throughout the symphony Davies uses E, a semitone lower and a tritone above the tonic‚Äîa technique used earlier by Bart√≥k in the first movement of his Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta . An additional unifying element used throughout the work is the plainsong \\"Nativitas tua, Dei Genetrix\\", a chant for the birthday of the Virgin Mary, which also happens to be the composer's birthday . The symphony has been characterised as Davies's La Mer , and compared, both in quality and in structure, to Vaughan Williams's Sixth Symphony . Instrumentation The symphony is scored for two flutes, piccolo (doubling alto flute), two oboes, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, three trumpets, two trombones, timpani, glockenspiel, crotales, marimba, harp, and strings. Analysis The symphony is in four movements, corresponding loosely to the traditional symphony plan: # Allegro molto ‚Äì Allegro # Adagio # Allegro molto, leggiero # Adagio, flessibile ‚Äì Poco pi√π mosso ‚Äì Pi√π mosso ‚Äì Moderato ‚Äì Allegro The first movement begins with an introduction presenting all of the germ cells used in the entire symphony. This is followed by a sonata-allegro, in which the usual development is replaced by a succession of transformation processes. The second movement is in the tritone-related key of F minor. A slow theme in the cellos, presenting \\"an almost Elgarian demeanour\\" (Dunnett 1994, 54) is followed by four variations‚Äîcalled \\"doubles\\" by the composer ‚Äîfor bassoon, horn, oboe, and trumpet. The third movement resembles a scherzo and trio, and is in F major. The final movement returns to the tonal centre of B. It begins as a passacaglia, recalling the finale of Brahms's Fourth Symphony only of a more episodic nature . However, it gradually evolves, first into a character similar to the first movement, and then into the manner of a traditional symphonic finale. Discography * Peter Maxwell Davies: Symphony No. 2.

R. Rahman to the 2012 Indian romantic drama film of the same name, written and directed by Gautham Menon, featuring Prateik Babbar and Amy Jackson, in her Bollywood debut, in the lead roles. This film is a remake of Gautham Menon's own Tamil film, Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa. The soundtrack album was released at Lawns of Taj Khema, eastern gate of The Taj Mahal, Agra, by A. R. Rahman on 21 December 2011.  Background  A. R. Rahman has retained the same tunes from Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa. The soundtrack album consists of lyrics penned by Javed Akhtar, collaborating with Gautham Menon for the first time. Javed Akhtar had to be in Chennai, to supervise the script and writing the lyrics for the film. A source close to the development said, \\"Javed saab and Gautham hit it off well. The lyricist's inputs will be taken into consideration as Gautham is particular that his film should not come across as a routine South Indian remake.\\"  Release  The crew including A. R. Rahman and Javed Akhtar were set to perform live at Mehtab Bagh, which has a stunning backdrop in the Taj Mahal. However, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) later denied permission to the crew owing to the damages sustained while shooting for Mere Brother Ki Dulhan was going on at Mehtab Bagh.

For those who are already in love with VTV and YMC songs, you should probably take the instrumentals and the first song alone\\". Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama rated the album 3.5 out of 5 and stated \\"Ekk Deewana Tha is a very good album and a wholesome musical experience. Except for 'Kya Hai Mohabbat' (which ironically arrives at the very beginning of the album), rest of the album is fantastic and is a must-hear for those who swear by Rahman's score and also those who may not necessarily be bowled over by each and every work of this.\\" Atta Khan of Planet Bollywood rated the album 7/10 and stated \\"Vinnaithandi Varuvaayaa was an award-winning soundtrack that had fans thrilled in Southern India! And after hearing Ek Deewana Tha you can appreciate why the original Tamil version was such a big hit ‚Äì songs like \\"Aromale\\", \\"Hosanna\\" and \\"Sharminda Hoon\\" sound refreshing even for the romantic genre!\\"  References  2011 soundtrack albums A.

The Military Police was established shortly after the establishment of Pakistan, when elements of active duty Corps of Military Police reached to Abbottabad Military District (AMC) and reported to Pakistan Military Academy on November 1947 as a separate entity.

Early life King was born circa 1811, the son of Richard King, a Londoner. He was educated at St Paul's School, London, and then was apprenticed to an apothecary in 1824. He also trained at Guy's Hospital and St Thomas's Hospital in London. He studied at Guy's under Thomas Hodgkin, later to be a colleague in the development of ethnology. King became M.R.C.S. on 29 June and L.S.A. on 16 August 1832, and obtained the honorary degree of M.D. of New York in 1833. He was subsequently made a member of the court of examiners of the Apothecaries' Society in London. Arctic travels Shortly after qualifying as a medical man King obtained the post of surgeon and naturalist in the expedition led by Captain George Back, to the mouth of the Great Fish River (now known as the Back River) between 1833 and 1835, in search of Captain John Ross. He took a prominent part in the expedition and is frequently mentioned in Back's Narrative (1836), to which he contributed botanical and meteorological appendices. Later life On 20 July 1842, King issued the prospectus which originated the Ethnological Society of London. In 1844, he published an address to the society, of which he was the first secretary. In 1850, King was appointed assistant-surgeon aboard , in the expedition sent out to search for Franklin under Captain Horatio Austin, and in 1857 King received the Arctic Medal for his services. In 1870, when the Ethnological Society of London and its successor, the Anthropological Society, merged in the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain, King became a member of the council of the institute. He was also a member of the general council of the British Association. Death King died at his residence in Blandford Street, Manchester Square, London, on 4 February 1876. Works King published an independent account of the expedition under George Back, entitled Narrative of a Journey to the Shore of the Arctic Ocean under command of Captain Back (1836), 2 vols. In it he took a more sanguine view than his commander of the value of the Back River as a base for future arctic exploration. In 1855, he drew up a summary of his correspondence with the Admiralty, entitled The Franklin Expedition from first to last, in which he criticised the government. King was a contributor to the Journals of the Ethnological Society, the Statistical Society, the Medical Times (of which he was for some time editor), and other periodicals. With two medical books on the cause of death in still-born infants he published: * The Physical and Intellectual Character and Industrial Arts of the Esquimaux (1844) * The Natives of Vancouver's Island and British Columbia (1869) * The Manx of the Isle of Man (1870) * The Laplanders (1871) Controversy and reputation King's reputation as argumentative is well-established, but he is now better thought of than by many of his influential contemporaries. His view of the Back expedition as having missed opportunities and implicit argument for recognition of his own contribution are accepted by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. He received sympathy in his grievances from the newspapers of the time, but his perceived eccentricity told against him. The Dictionary of National Biography in its first edition spoke of his dying \\"in obscurity\\". When in 1845 the Admiralty proposed the Franklin expedition, King wrote very strongly to Lord Stanley, then Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, recommending, instead of the polar sea journey, a land journey by the Great Fish River, and offering his services. The Admiralty gave a deaf ear both to this project and to those which King would have substituted for the measures proposed for the relief of John Franklin in 1849. King's May 1847 article in The Athen√¶um (a letter to Lord Grey the Colonial Secretary) was answered by Charles Richard Weld, who countered King's perceived alarmist tone with reassurance about the expedition's food supplies. In the same periodical Alexander Kennedy Isbister took a practical tone: conceding that Knight's speculations on the longitude of the Franklin party might be correct, he argued that Knight's preferred land expedition of relief could not carry enough supplies. Opinions still differ as to whether or not King's proposal would have, in fact, saved lives.

The sum of variable registrar fees is intended to total US$3.8 million.ICANN Adopted Budget: Fiscal Year 2007‚Äî2008 The competition created by the shared registration system enables end users to choose from many registrars offering a range of related services at varying prices. Designated registrar Domain registration information is maintained by the domain name registries, which contract with domain registrars to provide registration services to the public. An end user selects a registrar to provide the registration service, and that registrar becomes the designated registrar for the domain chosen by the user. Only the designated registrar may modify or delete information about domain names in a central registry database. It is not unusual for an end user to switch registrars, invoking a domain transfer process between the registrars involved, that is governed by specific domain name transfer policies. Although the dedicated registrar is the only entity that can modify or delete information regarding domain names in the central registry, there are many domain resellers that allow you to sell domains. You do not have to become a designated registrar in order to sell and register domains. When a registrar registers a \`com\` domain name for an end-user, it must pay a maximum annual fee of US$7.34 to VeriSign, the registry operator for \`com\`, and a US$0.18 annual administration fee to ICANN. Most domain registrars price their services and products to address both the annual fees and the administration fees that must be paid to ICANN. Barriers to entry into the bulk registrar industry are high for new companies without an existing customer base. Many registrars also offer registration through reseller affiliates. An end-user registers either directly with a registrar, or indirectly through one or more layers of resellers. As of 2010, the retail cost generally ranges from a low of about $7.50 per year to about $35 per year for a simple domain registration, although registrars often drop the price far lower ‚Äì sometimes even free ‚Äì when ordered with other products. The maximum period of registration for a domain name is 10 years. Some registrars offer longer periods of up to 100 years, but such offers involve the registrar renewing the registration for their customer; the 100-year registration would not be in the official registration database. DNS hosting Registration of a domain name establishes a set of Start of Authority (SOA) records in the DNS servers of the parent domain, indicating the IP address (or domain name) of DNS servers that are authoritative for the domain. This provides merely a reference for how to find the domain data ‚Äì not the actual domain data. Registration of a domain does not automatically imply the provision of DNS services for the registered domain. Most registrars do offer DNS hosting as an optional free service for domains registered through them. If DNS services are not offered, or the end-user opts out, the end-user is responsible for procuring or self- hosting DNS services. Without DNS services for the domain, the registration is essentially useless for Internet services, although this situation is often encountered with domain parking and cybersquatting. Domain name transfer A domain name transfer is the process of changing the designated registrar of a domain name. ICANN has defined a Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars. The usual process of a domain name transfer is: # The end user verifies that the whois admin contact info is correct, particularly the email address; obtains the authentication code (EPP transfer code) from the old registrar, and removes any domain lock that has been placed on the registration. If the whois information had been out of date and is now updated, the end-user should wait 12‚Äì24 hours before proceeding further, to allow time for the updated data to propagate. # The end user contacts the new registrar with the wish to transfer the domain name to their service, and supplies the authentication code. # The gaining Registrar must obtain express authorization from either the Registered Name Holder or the Administrative Contact. A transfer may only proceed if confirmation of the transfer is received by the gaining Registrar from one of these contacts. The authorization must be made via a valid Standardized Form of Authorization, which may be sent e.g. by e-mail to the e-mail addresses listed in the WHOIS. The Registered Name Holder or the Administrative Contact must confirm the transfer. The new registrar starts electronically the transfer of the domain with the help of the authentication code (auth code). # The old registrar will contact the end user to confirm the authenticity of this request. The end user may have to take further action with the old registrar, such as returning to the online management tools, to re-iterate their desire to proceed, in order to expedite the transfer. # The old registrar will release authority to the new registrar. # The new registrar will notify the end user of transfer completion. The new registrar may have automatically copied over the domain server information, and everything on the website will continue to work as before. Otherwise, the domain server information will need to be updated with the new registrar. After this process, the new registrar is the domain name's designated registrar. The process may take about five days. In some cases, the old registrar may intentionally delay the transfer as long as allowable. After transfer, the domain cannot be transferred again for 60 days, except back to the previous registrar. It is unwise to attempt to transfer a domain immediately before it expires. In some cases, a transfer can take up to 14 days, meaning that the transfer may not complete before the registration expires. This could result in loss of the domain name registration and failure of the transfer. To avoid this, end users should either transfer well before the expiration date, or renew the registration before attempting the transfer. If a domain registration expires, irrespective of the reason, it can be difficult, expensive, or impossible for the original owner to get it back. After the expiration date, the domain status often passes through several management phases, often for a period of months; usually it does not simply become generally available. The lists appear to all use at most 16 publicly available generic TLDs (gTLDs) that existed as of December 2009, plus .us. A February 2010 ICANN zone file access concept paper explains that most country code TLD (ccTLD) registries stopped providing zone files in 2003, citing abuse.ICANN zone file access concept paper See also *Domain name registry *Private sub-domain registry References External links * InterNIC Registrar Listing - Directory of ICANN accredited registrars listed alphabetically by name, location, and language supported. * Registrar Accreditation: Process * Registrar Accreditation: Financial Considerations * ICANN. \\"Registry Operator Maximum Price Schedule\\" Revised VeriSign .com Registry Agreement: Appendix G. 16 April 2001. * RFC 2832 ‚Äì NSI Registry Registrar Protocol (RRP) Version 1.1.0 * RFC 3632 ‚Äì VeriSign Registry Registrar Protocol (RRP) Version 2.0.0 Domain Name System ","title":"Domain registration"},{"id":"34133843","text":"Carmen Rupe, born Trevor Rupe and often simply known as Carmen (10 October 1936 ‚Äì 14 December 2011) was a New Zealand-Australian drag performer, brothel keeper, anti-discrimination activist, would-be politician, and HIV/AIDS activist. Carmen Rupe was New Zealand's first iconic drag queen. She was a transgender woman. Life Born in the small rural town of Taumarunui in the central North Island of New Zealand, Rupe had twelve siblings. She relocated to the urban centres of Auckland and Wellington. After doing drag performances while doing compulsory military training and periods working as a nurse and waiter, Rupe moved to Sydney's Kings Cross in the late 1950s. In the 1970s, she became notorious for the sexually tolerant venues she established in Wellington. Taking the name of the gypsy Flamenco dancer Carmen Amaya, Rupe became Australia's first MƒÅori drag performer and from that time on lived as a woman. A whole range of work followed, including snake-work, hula dancing and prostitution. Carmen never formally worked at Les Girls but over the years did some extremely exciting, well received guest spots. She described how local police treated her: I was locked up in Long Bay about a dozen times. But it made me a stronger person today. An arrest in New Zealand failed to produce a conviction, because drag was not illegal there, unlike in Australia. Autobiography  In 1988 an autobiography was published, outlining her escapades \\"from school boy to successful business woman\\".\\"Having A Ball: My Life\\" was written with Paul Martin and published by Benton Ross. Politics Carmen Rupe in 2009 in Wellington with Charles Chauvel (left), Grant Robertson, and Maryan Street In Wellington Carmen ran Carmen's International Coffee Lounge and the Balcony strip club. Despite the fact that the law criminialised homosexual acts, Carmen challenged the overt discrimination and prejudice against people in the gay and transgender communities. She was not afraid to speak to the press and was summoned to appear before the Privileges Committee by Prime Minister Robert Muldoon for suggesting some MPs were gay or bisexual. In 1977 she ran for the Wellington mayoralty, with the support of local businessman Sir Bob Jones, with the slogans get in behind and Carmen for mayorTrust: A true story of Women and Gangs. Pip Desmond. 2009. Page 158 and a platform of gay marriage and legalised brothels, though neither of these are local-government matters in New Zealand. Michael Fowler won re-election as Mayor. Last years Rupe returned to Surry Hills, Sydney where she lived the remainder of her life. In 2003 she was inducted into the Variety Hall of Fame. In 2008 she rode her mobility scooter topless at the head of the Decade of the Divas float at the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. She was a prominent member of Agender, the New Zealand transgender group. Rupe died in St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney of kidney failure on 15 December 2011 after a fall and hip surgery earlier in the year, she was 75. Legacy A green pedestrian light depicting Carmen Rupe on Cuba Street, Wellington A green pedestrian light depicting Carmen Rupe on Cuba Street, Wellington Rupe has been cited as a role model by MP Georgina Beyer, the world's first openly transgender Member of Parliament. Long time friend and ex Grey District Councilor Jacquie Grant MNZM wrote this moving tribute for Carmen and at her Tangi delivered an equally moving Eulogy. . In a heartfelt tribute, Sydney Mayor Clover Moore stated that \\"Carmen Rupe was an icon for Sydney's Transgender community and a tireless advocate for GLBT rights. She was a quiet achiever who spent decades as a volunteer with many organisations who provided support to some of our cities most vulnerable people. I knew Carmen and was saddened by her passing. She will be missed by the people she touched and the community she was such a strong part of. It is heartening that, in accordance with her wishes, the Carmen Rupe Memorial Trust has been established to raise awareness of some of the issues faced by our GLBT community. This is a fitting tribute to someone who dedicated so much of their life to helping others\\" Wellington Mayor Celia Wade-Brown supports erecting a statue of Rupe in Wellington: \\"I admired her strength in living her life on her terms and standing up against discrimination.\\" Four sets of traffic lights along Cuba Street in Wellington's central business district are fitted with green pedestrial lights depicting Rupe. The lights were installed in August 2016 to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the Homosexual Law Reform Act. In 2020, the short film GURL was released based on Rupe's life. The short film was a prequel to the feature film \\"The Book of Carmen\\", which is currently in pre-production. The film was directed, produced and written by Mika X.

It acts as a comprehensive framework for the opposition coalition to govern the country if the opposition parties manages to gain control of the Malaysian federal government from the ruling party Barisan Nasional in the upcoming general elections.http://www.ar- rifke.com/2011/01/apa-itu-buku-jingga-pr-download-buku-jingga-percuma.html Buku Jingga is the basic policy that was formally agreed between the three component parties during the Second Pakatan Rakyat Convention in Penang on 19 December 2010. It acts as an alternative to Barisan Nasional's policies such as the Economic Transformation Programme, New Economic Model (NEM) and the Government Transformation Programme (GTP) Buku Jingga outlines its stand on various issues in the current administration in Malaysia, and which therefore underlies the proposal of a 100-day reform across the country. Besides that, Buku Jingga serves as a basis to the manifesto of a social contract between the government and the people. This includes increases in teacher's incentives, abolishment of the highway toll system and the Internal Security Act (ISA), and the increase of royalties paid by the government to oil- producing states in Malaysia. Goals and Objectives * A transparent and true democracy to demonstrate and accredit the supremacy of the people of Malaysia; * A dynamic and sustainable economy to offer wealth and social benefit to all; * Social justice to guarantee an integrated development of rights and respect of human dignity. * Federal state and foreign policies that are based on the fundamentals of fairness and justice. Objectives * To protect the Federal Constitution, Islam as the official religion of the Federation while other forms of non-Islamic religions can be adhered and practised freely and peacefully in the country. * To protect the role and authority of the institution of Constitutional Monarchy. * To uphold the use of the Malay language in correspondence to Article 152 of the Constitution and advocate the Malay language as the country's lingua franca, while preserving and strengthening the use of mother tongue for all races and of all social background, and ameliorate the command of the English language in order to improve Malaysia's global competitiveness. Common Policy Platform These are the basic principles set out by the Pakatan Rakyat which have been put into practice in several Pakatan Rakyat controlled states in Malaysia with several key people-friendly policies to achieve distributive growth. Freeing Our National Institutions Pakatan Rakyat vows to: * Extend the practice of transparent and responsible government currently advocated by Pakatan Rakyat states, to demonstrate our commitment towards freeing the nation's institutions from the undue influence of politics. * Establish Set up a Council of Experts to develop and change existing national policies with regard to key economic, political and social challenges. * Enhance the working of Pakatan Rakyat‚Äôs Parliamentary Committees (currently tasked to shadow designated ministries), to monitor and verify the operational effectiveness of the various Ministries by publishing reports and findings once every six months. * Provide information and educate a wider audience of the precedence of independent national institutions with integrity, co-operating with NGOs and civil society. * Proceed to pressure on the current Government to free the nation's institutions from political conflict, through sustained campaigns and initiatives. Achieving Prosperity Through a Fairer Distribution of Income Pakatan Rakyat believes that hardships and poverty faced by majority of Malaysians are caused by uneven distribution of income. Therefore, it vows to: * Create a paradigm shift in the mainstream discourse away from the obsession by the ruling party with corporate equity shareholdings to one that revolves on concrete and measurable targets that focuses on actual household income. The 30% Malay/Bumiputra equity target obsessively defended by ruling party has been seized by the very same elites defending it. These equity targets means nothing to the majority of Malays/Bumiputras, still in poverty under the regime of the ruling party. Pakatan Rakyat propose using household income targets; targets that will directly impact hundreds of thousands of Malaysian families earning less than RM1,500 per month. * Probe and take necessary action against the exploiters of the people's wealth; stolen in the name of championing the interests of the Malays/Bumiputra, including the scandalous loss of shares worth RM52 billion allocated to the elite and cronies. * Resume non-discriminatory direct assistance schemes for the people as a means of equitable wealth redistribution, including welfare inspired schemes such as free water, old folks and single mother assistance. * Safeguard the people's right to petrol and basic household subsidies so long as corporate subsidies to independent power producers and concessionaires remain. * Challenge the interest of the poorest, regardless of race with household incomes under RM1,500 per month. The party coalition strives to provide a minimum household income of RM4,000 per month for every household in Malaysia within the first 5 years of a Pakatan Rakyat government. This is achievable by way of implementing a series of policies which will raise incomes and create job opportunities to ensure that every household will be able to have more than one member in employment. These policies will include the implementation of a minimum wage, employment laws which will allow women to work from their homes, training schemes to transform and upgrade the skill- sets of the Malaysian workforce, and entrepreneurial assistance free from discrimination. * Offer and ensure food security for all and ensure reasonable food prices, including efforts to reduce the nation's dependence on food imports. Within the first two years of taking power at federal level. Increasing the People's Disposable Income Pakatan Rakyat believes that there has been an incessive erosion of the rakyat's purchasing power, as inflation continues to outpace increases in salaries. In addition to promoting productivity growth, there is an increasing pressure to address the problem of rising costs which are suppressing the disposable income of the people. Productivity growth will require the development of an effective education system, the growth of investments and the promotion of R&D.; This will take time to implement and achieve. However, the party coalition believes it can address unjustified high costs of utilities due to corporate monopolies and put the steps to ensure abundance of affordable housing immediately. Therefore, Pakatan Rakyat vows to: * Re-construct four key areas of public infrastructure and utilities in order to reduce the high prices incurred by the people, by preventing concession holders from monopolies and excessive profits. The four areas of public infrastructure and utilities concerned are water, electricity, highways and broadband connectivity. Pakatan Rakyat will ensure that these utilities are either cost effectively run or competitive via effective regulations. * Finalize the take-over of the management of the water industry in the Klang Valley in order to ensure that water tariffs remain affordable. The party will proceed the Free Water Scheme enjoyed by the rakyat thus far. * Prevent the wholesale privatisation of the healthcare sector, as this could jeopardise the cost and quality of healthcare to the people. It will thus ensure that quality healthcare services can continue to be enjoyed by the rakyat free of charge. * Create a National Housing Board to oversee, develop and manage a people-centric housing development scheme. This will ensure that every family in Malaysia can afford to own a comfortable dwelling at a price commensurate with their income. * Quickly solve outstanding cases of abandoned housing projects which continue to oppress the rakyat, by any means thought appropriate by the Pakatan Rakyat state governments. Thus far, Pakatan Rakyat governments have already begun to rejuvenate housing projects involving some 3,000 homes. * Pursue and further expand micro-credit schemes introduced to help the poorest improve their economic position, through financial aid, training and effective implementation. Thus far, RM70 million has already been allocated for various micro-credit schemes in the Pakatan Rakyat states. Transparency Empowering the People Besides that, Pakatan Rakyat thinks that the people possess the right to monitor the effectiveness of any government ‚Äì to ensure good and clean administration. Pakatan Rakyat vows to: * Proceed the empowerment of the people as a check and balance mechanism by practising complete transparency of government and information. This will comprise the complete implementation of the Freedom of Information Enactments already introduced in Pakatan Rakyat states. * Extend support for civil society through increased assistance to NGOs which champion the rakyat's interests, as part of the overall effort to strengthen the role of NGOs as the voice of the rakyat. Emphasizing Education and Educators Recognising the immense contribution of the educators towards the nation‚Äôs development and social solidarity, Pakatan Rakyat vows to: * Offer direct funding to all types of educational institutions - at all levels and for academic, technical and vocational streams - in order to expand access to effective education for Malaysians of all walks of life. Aside from that, educators are the core of the Malaysian education system and the party would offer them direct assistance programmes, as recognition of their key role and their noble sacrifices and unrelenting service in nation building. * Standardize the pay of educators using the principle of fair assessment with consideration to expertise and length of service. * Implement a salary scheme with a fair and comprehensive assessment system for teachers which will be on par with that of engineers, accountants and doctors. This is our firm commitment to establish a quality education system. In addition, reassess current deployments in schools to ensure that all teachers are fully trained and qualified, including a resolution of the status of temporary teachers. * Curtail the bureaucratic and administrative burden faced by Malaysian educators. The ruling party's constant cycle of new education policies and its emphasis on administrative perfection and complete reports has come at the expense of time which would have been better spent in educating our future generations. A Culture of Knowledge is the Core of our Universities Under regime of Barisan Nasional, Pakatan Rakyat believes that Malaysian universities are trapped in a crisis of credibility and quality. This is a pressing and major problem for the nation. Aside from that, Pakatan Rakyat believes that no further time can be wasted, and that urgent and specific attention is needed, with a concerted effort to restore the standard of the varsities. Therefore, Pakatan Rakyat vows to: * Reinstate intellectual and academic freedom to the universities, by ending all forms of political interference in their administration. * Form a Selection Panel, staffed by experts, to shortlist and assess the suitability of candidates to lead the universities. The party shall ensure that the best possible candidates are placed at the head of our universities. Furthermore, the party are obligated to the principle of academic meritocracy in various varsities. * Strongly advocate the students‚Äô struggle to repeal the University and University College Act and restore the right of university students to express themselves and engage fully in political thoughts and activities. * Deal the funding crisis in higher education. PTPTN‚Äôs deficit is projected to reach a stratospheric RM46 billion within a decade. The party would minimise the financial burden of student loans by offering interest-free schemes and allowing repayments to start six months after entering full-time employment. * Assure the right of every qualified Malaysian to obtain tertiary and further education at minimal cost. * Revive the people‚Äôs right to educational scholarships, as enshrined in the Federal Constitution, for those who are deserving. The party vows to limit the need for costly private education. Combating Corruption Identifying the widespread destructive trends wrought by corruption upon the nation, Pakatan Rakyat vows to: * Allocate the administration of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) under the supervision of Parliament, including the appointment of MACC‚Äôs most senior positions. * Dispatch an all-out anti-corruption ‚Äòwar‚Äô at state level. This would include tightening government procedures and administrative mechanisms. * Provide legal services to defend any individual who exposes a corruption scandal, without regard for political affiliation. This is to encourage more people to come forward and play their part in the fight against corruption. * Proceed implementing the practice of open tenders, including the implementation of new steps with checks and balances in supply chain management. These are aimed at stamping out all forms of corruption. Sabah and Sarawak as Equal Partners Recognizing the position of Sabah and Sarawak as equal partners in the Malaysian Federation, and honouring previous agreements made, Pakatan Rakyat vows to: * Reinstate autonomy to Sabah and Sarawak in line with and within the framework of the Federal Constitution and the Federation Agreement. * Increase the royalties paid on petroleum and hydrocarbon resources to Sabah and Sarawak to 20% from the present 5%. * Establish a Royal Commission to solve the chronic problem of illegal immigration and citizenship in Sabah. * Assist bring the level of infrastructural development in Sabah and Sarawak up to par with other states of the Federation. * Promote national integration between Sabah, Sarawak and Peninsular Malaysia through a fair power-sharing arrangement that fully upholds the spirit of the Federation. First 100-Days Reform # Amend various public institutions, such as the Election Commission of Malaysia, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, the Attorney General of Malaysia and the Royal Malaysian Police to introduce transparency and reinstate accountability of the government. # Abolish the Internal Security Act. # Direct Khazanah Nasional Berhad, the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) and all other government organisation that possess highway concessions to complete the transference of such highway assets to the government with the purpose of abolishing tolls. # Alter the structure of national subsidies (such as the gas subsidies of RM 19 billion to independent power producers) and transferring these savings towards the subsidies of the people. # Acknowledge the roles and contributions of civil servants by re-assessing the salary structures; starting with an increase in teacher's salaries by RM 500 per teacher per month as an acknowledgement of the importance of their role as educators in nation- building. # Restore all private water concessions to the government, which would make water a public resource of the people. # Distribute free Wi-Fi internet services to all Malaysians living in the urban and semi-urban areas. # Dismiss FELDA Plantations to redistribute its estate lands to the second and third generations of the FELDA settlers. # Increase oil royalties to Sabah, Sarawak, Terengganu and Kelantan to 20%. # Form a Royal Commission to thoroughly investigate the problems of illegal immigration and citizenship in Sabah. Government position Malaysia's Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, has dismissed Buku Jingga as \\"not worth the paper it is printed on\\".

It uses a global content delivery network to provide web application security, DDoS mitigation, content caching, application delivery, load balancing and failover services. History Incapsula was founded in 2009 by Gur Shatz and Marc Gaffan. The company has its origins in Imperva (NYSE:IMPV), an American- based cyber security firm which owned 85% of Incapsula. It was spun out from Imperva in 2009. While reported to be growing at a rate of 50% per quarter as of August 2013, the company lost over $1.7 million in the second quarter of that same year. In February 2014 Imperva bought the remaining part of Incapsula and it became a product line within the parent company. In October 2013 Incapsula was credited with having protected against one of the Internet's largest attacks on a website. The September 24, 2013 attack was said to have lasted nine hours with 100Gbit/s of traffic at its peak. The attack was against BTC China, a bitcoin and yuan trading platform. In December 2016 Incapsula reported that it had defended against the largest DDoS attack ever recorded, which peaked at over 650Gbit/s and 200Mpps. Service and features Incapsula has multiple features that are used in the security and performance of websites: * Application Delivery Control (ADC) * Content Delivery Network (CDN) * DDoS Mitigation * Global Server Load-Balancing (GSLB) * Web Application Firewall (WAF) Incapsula WAF protects websites against cross site scripting, illegal resource access and all other OWASP top 10 threats, SQL injections, and web 2.0 threats including academic web archiving, comment spam, fake registrations, malicious bots, referrer spam, and site scraping. It works by changing a website's Domain Name System (DNS) record to route the website traffic through Incapsula. Incapsula then filters out malicious attacks from bots and website scrapers. Incapsula also has a content delivery network that caches websites on their server network to speed up website load time. The cached information is returned from a server closest to the end user in order to provide fast page loads. This also eliminates slow response from central servers due to heavy server traffic. Incapsula launched a tool named \\"Backdoor Protect\\" in 2013. The tool is reported to detect and block malicious backdoors and webshells. The tool works by comparing a website's traffic against a database of known backdoors. Later that year, the company announced Login-Protect, a two factor authentication feature as an integrated addition to its products. Incapsula also announced in 2013 that it would be implementing Layer 7 load balancing capabilities.

The concept is most commonly used in public policy assessment to justify continuing investment in parks, wildlife refuges and land conservation, as well as rail transportation facilities and services. It is also recognized as an element of the total economic value of environmental resources. This concept of \\"option value\\" in cost‚Äìbenefit analysis is different from the concept used in finance, where the term refers to the valuation of a financial instrument that provides for a future purchase of an asset. (See Option time value.) However, the two can be related insofar as both can be interpreted as a valuation of risk factors. Application In the environmental research literature, option value is commonly interpreted as the value of preserving threatened natural resources so that they might be available for use in the future. It has been applied for establishing the value of preserving wildlife habitats,Brookshire, D.S., L.S. Eubanks and R.A.

That was followed by an active academic debate about the concept, and refinement of its measurement. Some economists further developed its distinction from consumer surplus and role as an uncertainty risk aversion premium,Cicchetti, Charles J. and Freeman, A.

Martha May Eliot and Ethel Collins Dunham, 1915 Ethel Collins Dunham (1883‚Äì1969), and her life partner, Martha May Eliot, devoted their lives to the care of children. Dunham focused on premature babies and newborns, becoming chief of child development at the Children's Bureau in 1935. She established national standards for the hospital care of newborn children and expanded the scope of health care for growing youngsters by monitoring their progress in regular home visits by Children's Bureau staff.  Biography  Ethel Collins Dunham was born in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1883 to Samuel G. Dunham, a wealthy utility executive, and Alice Collins. She graduated from high school in 1901 and spent the next two years at boarding school. After several years of travel and leisure pursuits, she decided she wanted to study medicine and enrolled in a physics class at Hartford High School. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1914 and began her medical training at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine that same year with her friend and life partner, Martha May Eliot. Dunham completed an internship in pediatrics at Johns Hopkins Hospital under Dr. John Howland, and then served as the first woman house officer at New Haven Hospital. She became one of Yale School of Medicine's first female professors.Lilian Faderman, To Believe in Women: What Lesbians Have Done for America - A History, Houghton Mifflin, 2000, She was appointed instructor at Yale School of Medicine in 1920, promoted to assistant professor in 1924 and associate clinical professor in 1927. During this time she developed a special interest in improving the health of premature and newborn babies. She introduced numerous innovations at Yale, including buying a car so that interns could perform home visits for new mothers and their babies. She also reorganized the dispensary appointment system and negotiated with the chief of obstetrics to allow pediatricians to help care for new babies in the hospital nursery. In 1933 she presented her research on neonatal mortality and morbidity to the American Pediatric Society, which then appointed her head of its committee on neonatal studies. In 1935 Dunham was appointed chief of child development at the Children's Bureau, a national agency established in 1912 to improve the health and welfare of American children. Martha May Eliot had been appointed assistant chief. Dunham's first initiative was to investigate the treatment of premature babies and establish national standards for the care of newborns. The results of her first study appeared in 1936, and in 1943 her guidelines were published as Standards and Recommendations for the Hospital Care of Newborn Infants, Full Term and Premature. She also launched new programs to take hospital health care into the homes of new mothers, via the efforts of a public health nurse and a Children's Bureau social worker, who followed the progress of babies after their discharge from New York Hospital. Once again, the results of her survey shaped policies and practices in many health districts. From 1949 to 1951 she studied the problem of premature birth with an international team of experts for the World Health Organization in Geneva. Dunham retired in 1952. In 1957 the American Pediatric Society awarded her their highest honor, the John Howland Award. Dunham was the first woman pediatrician to receive the award; her life partner, Martha May Eliot was the second (honored in 1967). References  External links  * Dunham, Ethel C.

Originally introduced for studying slit mappings (conformal mappings of the open disk onto the complex plane with a curve joining 0 to ‚àû removed), Loewner's method was later developed in 1943 by the Russian mathematician Pavel Parfenevich Kufarev (1909‚Äì1968). Any family of domains in the complex plane that expands continuously in the sense of Carath√©odory to the whole plane leads to a one parameter family of conformal mappings, called a Loewner chain, as well as a two parameter family of holomorphic univalent self-mappings of the unit disk, called a Loewner semigroup. This semigroup corresponds to a time dependent holomorphic vector field on the disk given by a one parameter family of holomorphic functions on the disk with positive real part. The Loewner semigroup generalizes the notion of a univalent semigroup. The Loewner differential equation has led to inequalities for univalent functions that played an important role in the solution of the Bieberbach conjecture by Louis de Branges in 1985. Loewner himself used his techniques in 1923 for proving the conjecture for the third coefficient. The Schramm‚ÄìLoewner equation, a stochastic generalization of the Loewner differential equation discovered by Oded Schramm in the late 1990s, has been extensively developed in probability theory and conformal field theory. Subordinate univalent functions Let f and g be holomorphic univalent functions on the unit disk D, z < 1, with f(0) = 0 = g(0). f is said to be subordinate to g if and only if there is a univalent mapping œÜ of D into itself fixing 0 such that :\\\\displaystyle{f(z)=g(\\\\varphi(z))} for z < 1\\\\. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such a mapping œÜ is that : f(D)\\\\subseteq g(D). Necessity is immediate. Conversely œÜ must be defined by : \\\\displaystyle{\\\\varphi(z)=g^{-1}(f(z)).} By definition œÜ is a univalent holomorphic self-mapping of D with œÜ(0) = 0. Since such a map satisfies 0 < œÜ'(0) ‚â§ 1 and takes each disk Dr, z < r with 0 < r < 1, into itself, it follows that :\\\\displaystyle{ f^\\\\prime(0) \\\\le g^\\\\prime(0)} and :\\\\displaystyle{f(D_r) \\\\subseteq g(D_r).} Loewner chain For 0 ‚â§ t ‚â§ ‚àû let U(t) be a family of open connected and simply connected subsets of C containing 0, such that : U(s) \\\\subsetneq U(t) if s < t, : U(t)=\\\\bigcup_{s and : U(\\\\infty)={\\\\mathbb C}. Thus if s_n\\\\uparrow t, : U(s_n) \\\\rightarrow U(t) in the sense of the Carath√©odory kernel theorem. If D denotes the unit disk in C, this theorem implies that the unique univalent maps ft(z) : f_t(D)=U(t), \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, f_t(0)=0, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\partial_z f_t(0)=1 given by the Riemann mapping theorem are uniformly continuous on compact subsets of [0, \\\\infty) \\\\times D. Moreover, the function a(t)=f^\\\\prime_t(0) is positive, continuous, strictly increasing and continuous. By a reparametrization it can be assumed that : f^\\\\prime_t(0)=e^t. Hence :f_t(z)=e^tz + a_2(t) z^2 + \\\\cdots The univalent mappings ft(z) are called a Loewner chain. The Koebe distortion theorem shows that knowledge of the chain is equivalent to the properties of the open sets U(t). Loewner semigroup If ft(z) is a Loewner chain, then : \\\\displaystyle{f_s(D) \\\\subsetneq f_t(D)} for s < t so that there is a unique univalent self mapping of the disk œÜs,t(z) fixing 0 such that :\\\\displaystyle{ f_s(z)=f_t(\\\\varphi_{s,t}(z)).} By uniqueness the mappings œÜs,t have the following semigroup property: :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\varphi_{t,r}\\\\circ \\\\varphi_{s,t}=\\\\varphi_{s,r}} for s ‚â§ t ‚â§ r. They constitute a Loewner semigroup. The self-mappings depend continuously on s and t and satisfy :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\varphi_{t,t}(z)=z.} Loewner differential equation The Loewner differential equation can be derived either for the Loewner semigroup or equivalently for the Loewner chain. For the semigroup, let :\\\\displaystyle{ w_s(z)=\\\\partial_t\\\\varphi_{s,t}(z)_{t=s}} then :\\\\displaystyle{ w_s(z)=-zp_s(z)} with :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\Re\\\\, p_s(z) > 0} for z < 1\\\\. Then w(t)=œÜs,t(z) satisfies the ordinary differential equation : \\\\displaystyle{{dw\\\\over dt} = -w p_t(w)} with initial condition w(s) = z. To obtain the differential equation satisfied by the Loewner chain ft(z) note that : \\\\displaystyle{f_t(z)=f_s(\\\\varphi_{s,t}(z))} so that ft(z) satisfies the differential equation :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\partial_t f_t(z)= zp_t(z) \\\\partial_zf_t(z)} with initial condition :\\\\displaystyle{f_t(z)_{t=0} =f_0(z).} The Picard‚ÄìLindel√∂f theorem for ordinary differential equations guarantees that these equations can be solved and that the solutions are holomorphic in z. The Loewner chain can be recovered from the Loewner semigroup by passing to the limit: :\\\\displaystyle{ f_s(z) = \\\\lim_{t\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} e^t \\\\phi_{s,t}(z).} Finally given any univalent self-mapping œà(z) of D, fixing 0, it is possible to construct a Loewner semigroup œÜs,t(z) such that :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\varphi_{0,1}(z)=\\\\psi(z).} Similarly given a univalent function g on D with g(0) =0, such that g(D) contains the closed unit disk, there is a Loewner chain ft(z) such that : \\\\displaystyle{f_0(z)=z,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, f_1(z)=g(z).} Results of this type are immediate if œà or g extend continuously to ‚àÇD. They follow in general by replacing mappings f(z) by approzimations f(rz)/r and then using a standard compactness argument. Slit mappings Holomorphic functions p(z) on D with positive real part and normalized so that p(0) = 1 are described by the Herglotz representation theorem: :\\\\displaystyle{ p(z) =\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} {1 + e^{-i\\\\theta}z\\\\over 1 -e^{-i\\\\theta}z} \\\\, d\\\\mu(\\\\theta),} where Œº is a probability measure on the circle. Taking a point measure singles out functions : \\\\displaystyle{p_t(z)= {1+\\\\kappa(t) z\\\\over 1-\\\\kappa(t) z}} with Œ∫(t) = 1, which were the first to be considered by . Inequalities for univalent functions on the unit disk can be proved by using the density for uniform convergence on compact subsets of slit mappings. These are conformal maps of the unit disk onto the complex plane with a Jordan arc connecting a finite point to ‚àû omitted. Density follows by applying the Carath√©odory kernel theorem. In fact any univalent function f(z) is approximated by functions : \\\\displaystyle{g(z)=f(rz)/r} which take the unit circle onto an analytic curve. A point on that curve can be connected to infinity by a Jordan arc. The regions obtained by omitting a small segment of the analytic curve to one side of the chosen point converge to g(D) so the corresponding univalent maps of D onto these regions converge to g uniformly on compact sets. To apply the Loewner differential equation to a slit function f, the omitted Jordan arc c(t) from a finite point to ‚àû can be parametrized by [0,‚àû) so that the map univalent map ft of D onto C less c([t,‚àû)) has the form :\\\\displaystyle{ f_t(z)=e^t(z+b_2(t)z^2 + b_3(t) z^3 + \\\\cdots)} with bn continuous. In particular :\\\\displaystyle{f_0(z) = f(z).} For s ‚â§ t, let :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\varphi_{s,t}(z)= f_t^{-1} \\\\circ f_s(z)= e^{s-t} (z+a_2(s,t)z^2 + a_3(s,t) z^3 + \\\\cdots)} with an continuous. This gives a Loewner chain and Loewner semigroup with :\\\\displaystyle{p_t(z)={1+\\\\kappa(t) z\\\\over 1-\\\\kappa(t) z}} where Œ∫ is a continuous map from [0,‚àû) to the unit circle. To determine Œ∫, note that œÜs,t maps the unit disk into the unit disk with a Jordan arc from an interior point to the boundary removed. The point where it touches the boundary is independent of s and defines a continuous function Œª(t) from [0,‚àû) to the unit circle. Œ∫(t) is the complex conjugate (or inverse) of Œª(t): :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\kappa(t)=\\\\lambda(t)^{-1}.} Equivalently, by Carath√©odory's theorem ft admits a continuous extension to the closed unit disk and Œª(t), sometimes called the driving function, is specified by :\\\\displaystyle{f_t(\\\\lambda(t))=c(t).} Not every continuous function Œ∫ comes from a slit mapping, but Kufarev showed this was true when Œ∫ has a continuous derivative. Application to Bieberbach conjecture used his differential equation for slit mappings to prove the Bieberbach conjecture : \\\\displaystyle{a_3\\\\le 3} for the third coefficient of a univalent function :\\\\displaystyle{f(z)=z + a_2 z^2 + a_3z^3 +\\\\cdots} In this case, rotating if necessary, it can be assumed that a3 is non-negative. Then :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\varphi_{0,t}(z)=e^{-t}(z+a_2(t)z^2 + a_3(t) z^3 +\\\\cdots)} with an continuous. They satisfy :\\\\displaystyle{a_n(0)=0,\\\\,\\\\, a_n(\\\\infty)=a_n.} If :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\alpha(t)=e^{-t}\\\\kappa(t),} the Loewner differential equation implies :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\dot{a_2}=-2\\\\alpha} and :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\dot{a_3} =-2\\\\alpha^2 -4\\\\alpha\\\\, a_2.} So :\\\\displaystyle{ a_2 =-2\\\\int_{0}^\\\\infty \\\\alpha(t) \\\\, dt} which immediately implies Bieberbach's inequality :\\\\displaystyle{a_2\\\\le 2.} Similarly : \\\\displaystyle{a_3=-2\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\alpha^2\\\\, dt +4\\\\left(\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\alpha\\\\, dt\\\\right)^2} Since a3 is non- negative and Œ∫(t) = 1, : \\\\displaystyle{a_3=2\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\Re \\\\alpha^2\\\\, dt +4\\\\left(\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\Re \\\\alpha\\\\, dt\\\\right)^2} \\\\le 2\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\Re \\\\alpha^2\\\\, dt +4\\\\left(\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-t}\\\\,dt\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^t(\\\\Re \\\\alpha)^2\\\\, dt\\\\right) =1 +4\\\\int_0^\\\\infty (e^{-t}-e^{-2t}) (\\\\Re \\\\kappa)^2\\\\, dt \\\\le 3, using the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality.
