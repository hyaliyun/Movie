Early life and education  Fiaminghi was born in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, the son of Italian immigrants. From 1936 until 1941, Fiaminghi studied at the Liceu de Artes e Of√≠cios de S√£o Paulo. While at art school, Fiaminghi took drawing and porcelain painting courses with Giglio as well as courses with Odetto Guersoni, Lothar Charoux, and Waldemar da Costa. Fiaminghi also attended courses in art history held at Da Costa's studio. At the studio he meets many fellow artists, including Cl√≥vis Graciano and Maria Leontina. In 1942, Fiaminghi began studying with the painter Angelo Simeone at the Associa√ß√£o Paulista de Belas Artes, as well as studying advertising at Associa√ß√£o Paulista de Propaganda and the Instituto de Ci√™ncias e Letras Inglesa (Redschow School). From 1959 to 1966, Fiaminghi attended Alfredo Volpi's studio.  Career  From 1936 to 1939, Fiaminghi worked at Companhia Melhoramentos, where he did book illustration and lithography. After a job at another lithography company in 1940, Fiaminghi worked at Companhia Lithographica Ypiranga from 1941 to 1944, where he saw the lithographer, Lasar Segall, create his Mangue series, which showed the poverty in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. In 1944 and 1945, he worked at two other lithography companies, Graphicars F. Lanzara and Ind√∫stria Gr√°fica Siqueira Salles Oliveira & Cia, before he started his own company, Graphstudio Ltda. From 1949 to 1952, after selling his printing business, Faiminghi was hired an advertising art director at Lintas International Advertising S.A., where he worked on the ad account for Gessy-Lever. During this time he spent time painting street scenes in S√£o Paulo with a draftsman named Joaquim Alves who he worked with at Lintas. In the early 1950s, Fiaminghi began creating works that were abstract art, incorporating elements of constructive art. During this time he joined Grupo Ruptura and created work that is part of the concrete art movement founded by Waldemar Cordeiro. Fiaminghi did graphic design for posters, illustrating the work of concrete art pioneers Haroldo de Campos, D√©cio Pignatari, among others. In the 1960s, Fiaminghi broke with Waldemar Cordeiro and the school of concrete art, and began to explore the use of color, creating works under the term \\"Corluz,\\" which became the names of many of his exhibition during that time.

The first was the Lodgepole Complex Fire in eastern Montana, which started on July 19 and burned over before it was declared 93% contained two weeks later. The second was the Rice Ridge Fire, which was identified as the nation's top wildfire priority, after it rapidly expanded from about to over on September 3, 2017. Approximately 48 fires were burning , though some were under . The fire season began a month earlier than usual and months of June through August were the hottest and driest on record for Montana. On July 29, Montana had 11.87 percent of its total land listed as in exceptional drought, the largest percentage in the nation. In mid September, the eastern portion of the Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park was closed by ice and snow in the Rockies, while simultaneously the western portion was closed due to wildfires. Federal disaster assistance was requested by Governor Steve Bullock and FEMA granted funds for the Rice Ridge Fire near Seeley Lake, Montana, Alice Creek Fire near Lincoln, Montana, West Fork Fire near Libby, Montana, Highway 200 Complex in Sanders County, Montana and the Moose Peak Fire. Over $280 million had been spent on firefighting by early August. A number of areas were subjected to evacuation orders, including most of the town of Seeley Lake.

It is located east of Sevierville off U.S. Highway 441. The bridge is a king post truss design and crosses the East Fork of Little Pigeon River. History Before the Harrisburg Bridge was built in 1875, the McNutts Bridge, which was washed away during a flood, existed in the same place. In March of that year, the Sevier County Court ordered a panel to be used to carry out and organize the construction of a new bridge. Panel members were J.H. Frame, A.E. Murphy, and D.W. Howard. As usual at the time, the local population contributed to the financing, or provided them with construction material, or worked as an assistant in building the project. The voluntary cash donations totalled $50, with the county's $25 contribution. Elbert Stephenson early (1850 ‚Äì 1917) was appointed as head of the new construction project. The early family settled in the area in the 1870s. Many of the family members were trained craftsmen, including carpenters, mill builders, locksmiths and engineers. Elbert participated in 1877, next to the bridge project, with 50 percent of the capital contribution of the Newport Mill by Alexander Umbarger. He was related to ___ wife Clementine (1843 ‚Äì 1922). In the late years of the 19th century, the population grew around Harrisburg, and life in the area flourished due to the many local mills and blacksmith workshops. After 1915 a new bypass was built around Harrisburg, the community slowly disappeared as many people moved away. In 1952 the bridge was stabilized with the help of a concrete bridge pillar attached to the building framework. In the 1970s, the overall state of the bridge had deteriorated so much that it was thought to demolish it, until the organization Daughters of the American Revolution raised the necessary financial resources to rehabilitate the bridge by donating revenue. It was also the organization that made the request to include the bridge in the National Register of Historic Places, which succeeded on June 10, 1975 (NRHP-ID 75001777). In 1983 the bridge was re-established, but it was noted on the bridge that the crossing for vehicles must not exceed the permissible total weight of three tons. In 2004 various repairs were carried out on the bridge. After this further renovation, the permissible total weight was increased to 15 tons. As of 2010, an average of 20 vehicles per day crossed the bridge. Construction details The span of the bridge is , the total length , the inner width . The building material of the walls consists partly of tinplate.NRISCovered Bridges in Tennessee - Tennessee Department of Transportation See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Sevier County, Tennessee *List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Tennessee *List of covered bridges in Tennessee  References   External links  * Bridges completed in 1875 Buildings and structures in Sevier County, Tennessee Covered bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Tennessee 1875 establishments in Tennessee Wooden bridges in the United States National Register of Historic Places in Sevier County, Tennessee Road bridges in Tennessee King post truss bridges in the United States ","title":"Harrisburg Covered Bridge"},{"id":"55207845","text":"Promelacacinidin is a polymeric condensed tannin composed of mesquitol.

On a national level, both the US President and the US Congress have the power to impose martial law since both can be in charge of the militia. In each state, the governor has the right to impose martial law within the borders of the state. In the United States, martial law has been used in a limited number of circumstances, such as New Orleans during the Battle of New Orleans; after major disasters, such as the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, or during riots, such as the Omaha race riot of 1919 or the 1920 Lexington riots; local leaders declared martial law to protect themselves from mob violence, such as Nauvoo, Illinois, during the Illinois Mormon War, or Utah during the Utah War; or in response to chaos associated with protests and rioting, such as the 1934 West Coast waterfront strike, in Hawaii after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and during the Civil Rights Movement in response to the Cambridge riot of 1963. The martial law concept in the United States is closely tied with the right of habeas corpus, which is, in essence, the right to a hearing and trial on lawful imprisonment, or more broadly, the supervision of law enforcement by the judiciary. The ability to suspend habeas corpus is related to the imposition of martial law. Article 1, Section 9 of the US Constitution states, \\"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\\" There have been many instances of the use of the military within the borders of the United States, such as during the Whiskey Rebellion and in the South during the Civil Rights Movement, but those acts are not tantamount to a declaration of martial law. The distinction must be made as clear as that between martial law and military justice. Deployment of troops does not necessarily mean that the civil courts cannot function, which is one of the keys, as the US Supreme Court noted, to martial law. In United States law, martial law is limited by several court decisions that were handed down between the American Civil War and World War II. In 1878, Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids US military involvement in domestic law enforcement without congressional approval. Throughout its history the United States underwent several examples of the imposition of martial law, aside from during the American Civil War. American Revolution The Boston Tea Party prompted Great Britain to pass the Massachusetts Government Act. As a result of the Boston Tea Party, Parliament passed the Massachusetts Government Act, one of the Intolerable Acts, which suppressed town meetings and assemblies, and imposed appointed government, tantamount to martial law.colonial- america.suite101.com/article.cfm/law-that-started-the-american- revolution\\"Governors or Generals?: A Note on Martial Law and the Revolution of 1689 in English America\\", Ian Steele, The William and Mary Quarterly, Third Series, Vol. 46, No. 2 (Apr. 1989), pp. 304‚Äì314\\"Home > Boston Tea Party > A Tea Party Timeline: 1773‚Äì1775\\", Old South Meeting House New Orleans in War of 1812 During the War of 1812, US General Andrew Jackson imposed martial law in New Orleans, Louisiana, before repulsing the British in the Battle of New Orleans.\\"The Battle of New Orleans Reconsidered: Andrew Jackson and Martial Law\\", Matthew Warshauer, Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association, Vol. 39, No. 3 (Summer, 1998), pp. 261‚Äì291\\"A National Hero, the Battle of New Orleans\\", Andrew Jackson (1767‚Äì1845)\\"Book Review: Andrew Jackson and the Politics of Martial Law: Nationalism, Civil Liberties, and Partisanship.\\" , American Historical Review, December 2007 Martial law was also imposed in a four-mile radius around the vicinity. When word came of the end of the war, Jackson maintained martial law, contending that he had not gotten official word of the peace. A judge demanded habeas corpus for a man arrested for sedition. Rather than comply with the writ, Jackson had the judge arrested. Nauvoo, Illinois, during the Illinois Mormon War In 1843, Missouri sought to extradite Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, for allegedly attempting to murder Missouri governor Lilburn Boggs. He escaped arrest with the help of members of his church, and was discharged on a writ of habeas corpus in the Municipal Court of Nauvoo, where he was mayor, even though it was outside the court's jurisdiction. People in the neighboring town of Carthage, Illinois, felt that Smith was abusing his position in order to avoid arrest. They requested that Governor Ford call out the militia to take Smith into custody, to which Governor Ford declined. A group of ex-Mormons published a paper called the Nauvoo Expositor which detailed Smith's alleged abuse of power. Together with the Nauvoo City Council, Smith ordered the destruction of the Nauvoo Expositor. This caused an uproar in neighboring towns, which interpreted the order as an attack on the freedom of speech. Smith was charged with causing a riot, which the Nauvoo courts dismissed. Neighboring cities raised money for a militia to go and capture Smith. Governor Ford arrived in Carthage and sent word to Smith that if he did not surrender, Ford would call out the militia. On June 18, Smith declared martial law in Nauvoo and called out the Nauvoo Legion, an organized city militia of about 5,000 men, Paragraph 6. to protect Nauvoo from outside violence. Ford sent a group of men and abolished martial law. By this time, Smith had escaped into Iowa but was convinced by his supporters to return. He was arrested for treason against the state of Illinois for declaring martial law. While awaiting trial in Carthage Jail, Smith was murdered by a mob. In 1845, Nauvoo was stripped of its charter for abuse of authority. This led to a series of conflicts known as the Illinois Mormon War. Utah during the Utah War Governor Brigham Young declared martial law on September 15, 1857 in Utah shortly before being removed as governor. Tension between Utah territory and the federal government was strained in 1857 due to the influence of theodemocracy in the Governor Brigham Young's semi-theocratic government, Utah's rejection of federal appointees, and Utah's acceptance of polygamy. In 1857, President James Buchanan sent U.S. forces to the Utah Territory in what became known as the Utah War. The Mormons, fearing that the large U.S. military force had been sent to annihilate them, made preparations for defense. On 15 September, Young publicly declared martial law in Utah. It was widely circulated throughout the territory and was delivered by messenger to Col. Alexander with the approaching army. The most important provision forbade \\"all armed forces of every description from coming into this Territory, under any pretense whatsoever\\".\\"Proclamation of Governor Young\\", Leroy R. Hafen & Ann W. Hafen (eds.), Mormon Resistance: A Documentary Account of the Utah Expedition, 1857‚Äì1858, p. 65. It also commanded that \\"all the forces in said Territory hold themselves in readiness to march at a moment's notice to repel any and all such invasion\\". But more important to California- and Oregon-bound travelers was the third section that stated, \\"Martial law is hereby declared to exist in this Territory...and no person shall be allowed to pass or repass into, through or from this territory without a permit from the proper officer.\\" Brigham Young ordered the people in Salt Lake City, Utah, to burn their homes and retreat south to Provo, Utah. Meanwhile, the Mormons harassed the approaching army. Eventually, Brigham Young was removed as governor and replaced by Alfred Cumming. Ex parte Milligan On September 15, 1863, President Lincoln imposed Congressionally authorized martial law. The authorizing act allowed the President to suspend habeas corpus throughout the entire United States (which he had already done under his own authority on April 27, 1861). Lincoln imposed the suspension on \\"prisoners of war, spies, or aiders and abettors of the enemy,\\" as well as on other classes of people, such as draft dodgers. The President's proclamation was challenged in Ex parte Milligan, 71 US 2 [1866]. The Supreme Court ruled that Lincoln's imposition of martial law (by way of suspension of habeas corpus) was unconstitutional in areas where the local courts were still in session. The Great Chicago Fire Artist's rendering of the Great Chicago Fire In response to the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, Chicago mayor Roswell B. Mason declared a state of martial law and placed General Philip Sheridan in charge of the city on October 9, 1871. After the fire was extinguished, there were no widespread disturbances and martial law was lifted within a few days., Morris, Roy, Jr., Sheridan: The Life and Wars of General Phil Sheridan, Crown Publishing, 1992, pp. 335‚Äì8. . Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, 1892 In 1892, in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, striking mineworkers blew up a mill and shot at strike-breaking workers. The explosion leveled a four-story building and killed one person. The governor declared martial law. At the same time, a request was made for federal troops to back guardsmen. Over 600 people were arrested. The list was whittled down to two dozen ringleaders who were tried in the military court. While in prison, the mine workers formed a new union, the Western Federation of Miners. San Francisco earthquake of 1906 Following the earthquake of 1906, the federal troops stationed in the Presidio were pressed into martial law service. They were posted throughout the city, and all dynamite was confiscated. The dynamite was used to destroy buildings in the path of fires, to prevent the fires from spreading. Colorado Coalfield War In 1914, the imposition of martial law climaxed during the Colorado Coalfield War. Dating back decades, the conflicts came to a head in Ludlow, Colorado, in 1913. The Colorado National Guard was called in to quell the strikers. For a time, the peace was kept, but it is reported that the make-up of the Guard stationed at the mines began to shift from impartial normal troops to companies of loyal mine guards. Clashes increased and the proclamation of martial law was made by the governor, eventually resulting in the Ludlow Massacre. President Wilson sent in federal troops, eventually ending the violence. On August 19, 1917, the Spokane office of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, or Wobblies) was raided, leaders arrested, and martial law was declared. The military authority was the National Guard, controlled by the U.S. War Department. This occurred in reaction to a demand by IWW leader James Rowan that all prisoners of the \\"class war\\" (he meant Wobbly strikers and strike leaders involved in a statewide lumber strike) be released or Spokane would face a general strike. The repression of the democratic, radical union in Spokane and across the state took place in the context of the Wobbly-led loggers' and sawmill workers' ongoing strike for the eight-hour day and sanitary conditions in the camps. The IWW was militant, radical, vocal and consistently nonviolent. The larger context of the repression of the union was war hysteria, combined with employer opposition to union demands. The nationwide suppression of the IWW during the war involved physical violence, vandalism, and the imprisonment of hundreds of union members and leaders. West Virginia Coal Wars During the events of the West Virginia Coal Wars (1920‚Äì1921), martial law was declared in the state of West Virginia. At the behest of Governor Cornwell, federal troops had been dispatched to Mingo County to deal with the striking miners. The army officer in charge acted, ostensibly, under the Suspension Clause of Article I of the United States Constitution (selectively; accounts show that he jailed only union miners), and did not allow assembly of any kind. If his soldiers found any union miners, they immediately took them and imprisoned them. The jails filled up so quickly that he had to release miners. As it went, miners were arrested, jailed, and released without any sort of trial. After a time, when the trial of Sid Hatfield began, the military occupation and \\"veritable military dictatorship\\" (Governor Cornwell) of the army officer ended. Many of the miners were not released from jail. It was only the first of three times that federal troops would be called to quiet the miners in the West Virginia Mine War. Minneapolis, Minnesota, 1934 In 1934, Minnesota Governor Floyd B. Olson placed the city of Minneapolis under martial law and deployed the National Guardsmen of the 34th Infantry due to escalating violence during the Minneapolis general strike of 1934 after Bloody Friday when police opened fire on picketers. On July 26, and these deaths of protesters at the hands of the police, Farmer-Labor governor Olson declared martial law and mobilized four thousand National Guardsmen of the 34th Infantry. Following this mobilization, there was no further loss of life. Between July 26 and August 1, the National Guard began issuing operating permits to truck drivers, and engaging in roving patrols, curfews, and security details. On August 1, National Guard troops seized strike headquarters and placed arrested union leaders in a stockade at the state fairgrounds in Saint Paul. The next day, the headquarters were restored to the union and the leaders released from the stockade, as the National Guard carried out a token raid on the Citizens Alliance headquarters. The union appealed to the Central Labor Union for a general strike and the governor issued an ultimatum that he would stop all trucks by midnight, August 5, if there was no settlement. Nevertheless, by August 14, there were thousands of trucks operating under military permits. Although the strike was gravely weakened by martial law and economic pressure, union leaders made it clear that it would continue. On August 21, a federal mediator got acceptance of a settlement proposal from A. W. Strong, head of the Citizens Alliance, incorporating the union's major demands. The settlement was ratified and the back of employer resistance to unionization in Minneapolis was broken. San Francisco, California, 1934 In 1934, California Governor Frank Merriam placed the docks of San Francisco under martial law, citing \\"riots and tumult\\" resulting from a dock worker's strike. The governor threatened to place the entire city under martial law. The National Guard was called in to open the docks, and a citywide institution of martial law was averted when goods began to flow. The guardsmen were empowered to make arrests and to then try detainees or turn them over to the courts. The Territory of Hawaii Hawaii was put under martial law after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor During World War II (1939 to 1945) what is now the State of Hawaii was held under martial law from December 7, 1941, to October 24, 1944, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. After the war, the federal judge for the islands condemned the conduct of martial law, saying, \\"Gov. Poindexter declared lawfully martial law but the Army went beyond the governor and set up that which was lawful only in conquered enemy territory namely, military government which is not bound by the Constitution. And they ... threw the Constitution into the discard and set up a military dictatorship.\\" Russell County, Alabama (1954‚Äì55) Freedom Riders On May 21, 1961, Governor Patterson of Alabama declared martial law \\"as a result of outside agitators coming into Alabama to violate our laws and customs\\" which had led to \\"outbreaks of lawlessness and mob action.\\" The agitators were \\"Freedom Riders\\", peaceful civil rights activists challenging the already-illegal racial segregation in the South. John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 H.R. 5122, also known as the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 was a bill passed in the United States Congress on September 29, 2006, and signed by President George W. Bush on October 17, 2006, becoming Public Law 109-364. In addition to allocating funding for the armed forces, it also gave the president the power to declare martial law and to take command of the National Guard units of each state without the consent of state governors. In 2006, Congress passed the 2007 National Defense Authorization Act, which gave the president the authority to mobilize National Guard units within the U.S. without the consent of state governors. But on April 2, 2007, US Senate held hearings about recent changes to the Insurrection Act of 1807, (in Sec 1072 of Defense Authorization Act) where Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont sought to reverse the 2006 amendments to the Insurrection Act, which had given the US President vast new powers to use military for domestic disturbance, terrorism, insurrection, etc, even changed the name from \\"Insurrection Act\\" to \\"Enforcement of the Laws to Restore Public Order.\\" In the Senate Hearing, Senator Chris Bond testified: \\"Mr. Chairman, the measure that was included in last year's congressional Defense Authorization Act I think was ill-conceived, unnecessary, and dumb. Even some of the members of the SASC who should have did not know about it. But this is an influential panel, and you know how it has changed the old law, and we now know that all 50 of our Nation's Governors, Adjutants General, and local law enforcement are opposed to it. Nobody knows where it came from. Allowing the President to invoke the Act and declare martial law where public order breaks down as a result of natural disaster, epidemic, terrorist attack, is very ambiguous and gives him broad authority potentially to usurp the role of the Governors,\\" Based on strong opposition by Congress, individual state Governors, law enforcement community, and absence of clarity on who even introduced these changes, the 'Enforcement of the Laws to Restore Public Order' law was repealed on January 28, 2008, (based on Sen. Pat Leahy's S. 513 proposal to repeal) and the previous Insurrection Act was restored.\\" As of 2020, the Insurrection Act of 1807 still applies in limiting a US President's ability under Title 10 to federalize National Guard troops for martial law purposes. Executive Directive 51 Executive Directive 51, also known as the National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive, was signed into law by President George W. Bush in May 2007. The directive, which was created in the wake of the September 11 attacks, allows the president to appoint a National Continuity Coordinator in order to maintain a continuity of government during a catastrophic emergency. As of 2020, the directive has not yet been invoked.

Published in 1890 after she had regained her freedom, it details Lathrop's institutionalization at Utica Lunatic Asylum for voicing suspicions that someone was trying to poison her. Written novelistically, book reviews of the time suggested that it was poorly written and fell short of its object, while 21st-century reviewers praise the exposing of 19th-century mental institutions, which confined outspoken women. A Secret Institution (New York: Bryant Publishing Co.) has the external appearance of a novel, but was intended as a statement of facts concerning the way things were managed in the Utica Lunatic Asylum. The author, Clarissa Caldwell Lathrop, said that in 1880, at the instance of her mother and sister, she was confined in that establishment and remained there for two years, although she was confident of her sanity during that entire period. She was finally brought out on a writ of habeas corpus applied for by James Bailey Silkman. She stated that, like herself, he had been incarcerated at Utica asylum under a false charge of lunacy, trumped up by relatives, and that on regaining his freedom, he published an announcement that he would \\"help any sane person out of an asylum who would communicate with him, giving his office address at New York City.\\" After Lathrop found a way to notify Silkman, he applied for a writ, on which she was taken to Hudson River State Hospital at Poughkeepsie, where her sanity was established and she was freed by Judge George G. Barnard.

The game was released for Microsoft Windows on September 19, 2017. The development team had previously developed Grow Home. Gameplay A gameplay screenshot showing an Omega Exoform attacking a more primitive Exoform. Atomega is a multiplayer-only action game. Played from a first-person perspective, eight players compete against each other to gain \\"mass\\" in order to score points. Players assume control of a simple Exoform when a match starts, and they must search the arena for cubes. By collecting these cubes, the player gains points and mass, which allows the Exoform to evolve to become larger and more sophisticated. The ultimate form is known as Omega Exoform, which is massive and powerful. The player who has the most mass by the end of the 10-minute match will win the game. To gain more points, players can engage in combat with other Exoforms, which when defeated, it will deform and its mass will be disintegrated. Different forms have different properties. For instance, the Prime is slow but powerful, while Saur is weaker but faster. Players can also teleport away from enemies in combat situations, but they will lose some of their mass and devolved into a smaller Exoform. There are also \\"hacks\\", which are golden cubes that give Exoform additional skills such as healing and knocking off opponents when they are collected. Development The game was developed by the team at Ubisoft Reflections which had developed Grow Home and Grow Up. The aim of the project is to create an \\"unusual\\" idea that will surprise players. The game was announced on September 11, 2017, and was released a week later, on September 17, 2017 for Microsoft Windows via Steam. The game only includes one mode and one map at launch. Reception The game received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregator Metacritic calculated an average score of 65 out of 100 based on 14 reviews. Christian Donlan from Eurogamer recommended the game, stating that the game was \\"fascinating\\" and unique. However, both Brett Makedonski from Destructoid and Mike Fahey from Kotaku noted that the game's lack of content results in low replayability and longevity. The game was nominated for \\"Best Arcade Game\\" at The Independent Game Developers' Association Awards 2018.

It is sometimes confused with the distantly related Turkish towel (Chondracanthus exasperatus) which is of a similar texture but larger. The specific epithet papillatus ('with papillae') is due to the nipple-like projections on the female gametophyte which can give the texture of a terrycloth washcloth found at a Turkish bath.

Habitat It grows on rocky substrates in the high- to mid-intertidal zones and has been found growing at depths of 250 m. Like many red algae species, it uses phycoerythrin to photosynthesize which allows it to grow deeper than plants using other pigments. Description Turkish washcloth is reddish-brown to almost black, with males paler than females and lacking the signature papillae on the blades. The blades are branched and small at less than 15 cm long, as one would expect to a plant with a diminutive common name. The first blades in the spring are thin, purple and lack papillae. Later in the year the thalli dry out and become grey and lifeless. Mastocarpus jardinii is a similar species, and can be confused with M. papillatus. Mazzaella affinis thalli looks similar in shape and color to male M. papillatus, but are smaller and grow in thick mats and not as individuals. It also can be confused with other species with Petrocelis phases , such as Pikea, other Mastocarpus spp., Ralfisa, and Hildenbrandia, thought the last two are thinner than the Turkish towel crust. Life cycle M. papillatus has a relatively complex reproductive cycle. Male gametophytes discharge nonflagellated sperm to drift in the current until they attach to the trichogynes of female plants. There the sperm perform mitosis without cell division, turning into a spermatium. Fertilisation then proceeds through a fertilization pore between the trichogyne and the spermatium. The eggs then grow into tetrasporophytes which are more or less copies of their parents. Alternately, the tetrasporophyte goes through the Petrocelis phase (so named as it was thought to be a distinct genus, Petrocelis, of Phyllophoraceae) and grows into a crust that looks like spilled tar, inspiring the black tar spot common name. The tetrasporophyte undergoes meiosis and produce tetrasporangia which release spores to germinate elsewhere. Eventually the crust grows into a typical adult plant. This crustose phase is shared by all members of the genus Mastocarpus as well as those in Pikea. Ecology Turkish washcloth is food for many animals, including Echinolittorina ziczac, Littorina, Amphipoda, Lottia, Pholis crassispina, Lottia scutum, Trochidae, Lacuna vincta, Stenosoma, Mopalia swanii, and Cryptochiton stelleri. Like the Porphyra species used to make nori, M. papillatus is susceptible to infection by the parasitic oomycete Pythium porphyrae, or red rot disease, which can kill large colonies. It is also susceptible to infection by Pythium marinum. Uses Grapestone is edible and can be cooked in soups or stir-fries but care must be taken as overcooking can turn the plant mushy and gelatinous. This property can be exploited to use it as a thickening agent like its close relative Mastocarpus stellatus. Grapestone has a similar flavor to oysters. Grapestone is easily foraged from the shore, but like any wild species overharvesting is possible. By grabbing the longer blades and pulling sideways, the shorter blades and holdfast may remain on the rock and live on. M. papillatus is also thought to have antimicrobial properties.

An enormous search operation was mounted in and around Cheviot Beach, but his body was never recovered. Holt was presumed to have died, and his memorial service five days later was attended by many world leaders. It is generally agreed that his disappearance was a simple case of an accidental drowning, but a number of conspiracy theories surfaced, most famously the suggestion that he had been collected by a Chinese submarine. Holt was the third Australian prime minister to die in office, after Joseph Lyons in 1939 and John Curtin in 1945. He was initially replaced in a caretaker capacity by John McEwen, and then by John Gorton following a Liberal Party leadership election. Holt's death has entered Australian folklore, and was commemorated by, among other things, the Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Centre. Background Harold Holt became Prime Minister of Australia in January 1966, following the retirement of Sir Robert Menzies. He was a career politician, entering parliament at the age of 27 and becoming a government minister at the age of 30.I. R. Hancock, Holt, Harold Edward (1908‚Äì1967) , Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1996, accessed online 14 September 2017. As with Menzies, Holt refused a security detail upon taking office, considering it unnecessary and potentially alienating to the general public. His stance changed after two incidents in mid-1966 ‚Äì a window in his office was shattered by a sniper, and then an assassination attempt was made on Arthur Calwell, the Leader of the Opposition. Holt grudgingly accepted a single bodyguard for his official duties, but refused any protection while on holiday, regarding it as a violation of his privacy.Frame (2005), p. 219. His wife Zara later suggested that this was so he could hide his extramarital affairs.Silence of Harold Holt's secret lover, Marjorie Gillespie , The Daily Telegraph, 13 September 2013. Retrieved 4 November 2017. Holt and the ocean Harold Holt on a spearfishing expedition at Portsea, Victoria, in 1966. Holt was a keen outdoorsman and had beach houses at Portsea, Victoria, and Bingil Bay, Queensland. He was introduced to spearfishing in 1954, and it soon became his preferred vacation activity. Holt wore a wetsuit so he could fish year round, and preferred either skin diving or snorkelling as he found air tanks burdensome and inauthentic.Frame (2005), p. 272. Once he had speared a fish, he would unzip his suit and place it inside (still bleeding), allowing him to continue fishing.Home movies cast angler Holt: all the way with LBJ , The Age, 1 November 2007. Retrieved 9 November 2017. According to his companions, Holt had \\"incredible powers of endurance underwater\\", and sometimes kept himself amused during parliamentary debates by seeing how long he could hold his breath. Although he could tread water for long periods, he was not a strong surface swimmer.Frame (2005), p. 273. Several of Holt's friends confronted him about the dangers of his hobby, including his press secretary, Tony Eggleton, to whom Holt responded, \\"Look Tony, what are the odds of a prime minister being drowned or taken by a shark?\\" On 20 May 1967, Holt had a close call while diving at Cheviot Beach on the Mornington Peninsula, where he became distressed and called for help. Pulled ashore by his diving companions, he remained conscious but turned purple and vomited a large amount of seawater. Holt attributed the incident to a leaking snorkel, and supposedly remarked, \\"That's the closest I have ever been to drowning in my life!\\" A few months later, on 5 August, he was spearfishing at Dunk Island on the Great Barrier Reef. He spent 25 minutes chasing a large coral trout, but eventually had to abandon the pursuit due to extreme shortness of breath. Holt's health Holt had been in reasonably good health throughout his life, although he had a family history of premature death ‚Äì his father had died at the age of 59 and his older brother at the age of 57.Frame (2005), p. 274. He suffered a severe concussion in a road accident in November 1955, in which the driver of his ministerial car was killed.Frame (2005), pp. 51‚Äì52. In September 1967, Holt began treatment for a painful shoulder injury that he had originally suffered playing football in his youth; he was prescribed painkillers and twice-weekly physiotherapy. A few days before his death, he had been briefly examined by his personal physician, Marcus Faunce, who advised him to avoid over-exerting himself and to cut back on swimming and tennis. The Prime Minister is Missing, a 2008 docudrama, suggested that Holt's judgment on the weekend of his death had been clouded by his medication, in combination with work-related tiredness and stress. Morphine was named as the drug that he had been prescribed, although there is \\"no direct evidence\\" that he had taken any on the day of his death.Harold Holt drowning under the spotlight, The Weekend Australian, 18 October 2008. Retrieved 4 November 2017. Lead-up to 17 December Holt's final cabinet meeting of 1967 began late on Thursday, 14 December, and ended early the following morning. He returned to The Lodge for a few hours of sleep, and then returned to his Parliament House office at 8:30 a.m. to finalise a press release. At 11 a.m., Holt left Parliament House and was driven to RAAF Base Fairbairn, where he boarded a military jet to Melbourne. His wife Zara stayed in Canberra to finalise preparations for the annual Christmas party. On arriving in Melbourne, Holt and his personal secretary, Patricia De Lacy, were driven to his constituency office. After dictating a few letters, he went on to his home at St Georges Road, Toorak. There, he informed his housekeeper, Edith \\"Tiny\\" Lawless, that he would be spending the weekend at his beach house.Frame (2005), p. 246. He also carried with him a letter from the Liberal Party whip expressing concern at the performance of the government. Holt drove down to Portsea in his red Pontiac Parisienne. He stopped in Sorrento on the way, where he ran into his neighbour, Marjorie Gillespie, and received an invitation to evening drinks. He spent about an hour with Gillespie and her husband Winton, and then had dinner with Lawless, who had driven down separately with Holt's clothes and provisions for the weekend. On Saturday, 16 December, Holt rose early and ate a light breakfast. He did some gardening, and made phone calls to Eggleton and his stepson Nicholas, inviting the latter down to Portsea. Holt played tennis in the afternoon, and then spent some time with Nicholas and his family. In the evening, he attended a neighbour's cocktail party for about an hour, and then returned home to host a dinner party with about a dozen guests.Frame (2005), p. 247. Disappearance Cheviot Beach, the site of Holt's disappearance, faces the Bass Strait separating Victoria and Tasmania Holt again rose early on Sunday, 17 December, and after breakfast telephoned his wife. He drove to the local general store mid-morning, where he bought insect repellent, peanuts, and the weekend newspapers. One of the headlines in The Australian was \\"PM advised to swim less\\", which detailed the latest advice from Holt's doctor; however, it is unclear if Holt bought or read that particular paper. On returning home, Holt made plans for the rest of the day, which included a visit to Point Nepean, a barbecue lunch, and an afternoon spearfishing trip. At 11:15 a.m., he and four others set out for Point Nepean, where they hoped to watch solo circumnavigator Alec Rose pass through The Rip into Port Phillip Bay. He was accompanied by Marjorie Gillespie, her daughter Vyner, and two family friends of the Gillespies, Martin Simpson and Alan Stewart.Frame (2005), p. 248. It was a hot day, and Rose's yacht was barely visible, so the group only stayed a short while before leaving.Frame (2005), p. 249. On the drive back to Portsea, Holt suggested that the group stop at Cheviot Beach for a swim ‚Äì it was about 12:15 p.m., and he wanted to cool down and work up an appetite before lunch. Holt knew the area well and had swum there many times before, in 1960 even salvaging a porthole from the SS Cheviot, the shipwreck that had given the beach its name. Holt did not hesitate in entering the water, despite a large swell and visible currents and eddies. Stewart was the only other swimmer, as the others considered it unsafe. Stewart stayed close to shore, and even in the shallows felt a strong undertow. However, Holt swam into deeper water and was dragged out to sea. The others called out to him, but he did not raise his arms or cry for help. He soon slipped under the waves and out of sight, in a manner which Marjorie Gillespie described as \\"like a leaf being taken out [...] so quick and final\\".Frame (2005), p. 250. Search Following Holt's disappearance, Stewart drove to the nearby Officer Cadet School Portsea, an Australian Army training facility. The school was virtually deserted as most personnel were on annual leave, but the Victoria Police were contacted and initiated what became \\"one of the largest search operations in Australian history\\". The search for Holt's body began at 1:30 p.m., when three amateur divers entered the water and found it too rough. They were soon joined by helicopters, watercraft, police divers, and two naval diving teams.Frame (2005), p. 251. However, little progress was made, due to the rough conditions and limited equipment available. By the end of the day, there were more than 190 personnel involved, with operations based out of the Officer Cadet School;Frame (2005), p. 252. this number would eventually increase to more than 340.Frame (2005), p. 259. The search resumed just before 5 a.m. on 18 December, despite strong wind, heavy seas, and occasional rain. Working in shifts, 50 divers focused on the rock pools and ledges near where Holt had last been sighted. They were forced to free dive to minimise injury, as they were continuously being driven against the nearby cliff face. Due to a change in the tide, the search was suspended at 8 a.m. and did not resume until mid-afternoon. The following day's operations were again hampered by the weather.Frame (2005), p. 262. Conditions improved on Wednesday, 20 December, but by the following day most personnel were being withdrawn. The search for Holt's body was officially called off on 5 January 1968, although it had been gradually scaled back to the point where it consisted only of a daily beach patrol.Frame (2005), p. 265. Lieutenant-Commander Phil Hawke, who led the HMAS Lonsdale diving team, would later state that \\"any chance of finding the prime minister was lost by the Sunday night\\". Aftermath Rumours of Holt's disappearance reached the media just over an hour after it occurred, and the first conclusive report was made at about 1:45 p.m., on Melbourne radio station 3DB. Zara Holt was told of her husband's disappearance by Peter Bailey, one of his secretaries. Memorial service A memorial service for Holt was held on Friday, 22 December, at St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne. It was led by Tom Thomas, the Dean of Melbourne, with a single eulogy given by Philip Strong, the Anglican Primate of Australia. Due to the absence of a body, there were no prayers of committal. There were 2,000 attendees within the cathedral, and many thousands more lined the nearby streets and listened through a public address system.Frame (2005), p. 266. Thirty newspaper reporters were given seats, but only one official photographer was allowed, as well as a single video camera at the back of the building. It was attended by Secretary General U Thant of the United Nations, President Lyndon B. Johnson of the United States, Charles, Prince of Wales, Prime Minister Harold Wilson and Edward Heath of the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Keith Holyoake of New Zealand, President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, President Chung Hee Park of South Korea, President Nguyen Van Thieu of South Vietnam, Prime Minister C. K. Yen of Taiwan, and Prime Minister Thanom Kittikachorn of Thailand. Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, and Western Samoa sent their foreign ministers as representatives, while numerous other countries sent their ambassadors.Frame (2005), p. 267. After the service, there was a formal reception at Government House, Melbourne. Succession issues John McEwen, the leader of the Country Party and de facto deputy prime minister, was at his farm in Stanhope, Victoria, when he was informed of Holt's disappearance. He immediately made his way to Canberra, and on the evening of 17 December met with Lord Casey, the Governor-General, at Yarralumla.Frame (2005), p. 253. Casey had already conferred with Chief Justice Garfield Barwick and Attorney-General Nigel Bowen, and agreed with McEwen that he should be commissioned to form a caretaker government while the Liberal Party elected a new leader. This was based on the precedent set in 1939, when Earle Page was made temporary prime minister after the death of Joseph Lyons.Frame (2005), p. 254. Casey issued a statement announcing his intentions the following day,Frame (2005), p. 261. and McEwen was sworn in as prime minister on the afternoon of Tuesday, 19 December. Discussions about who would succeed Holt as leader of the Liberal Party began as soon as his disappearance became general knowledge.Frame (2005), p. 255. The situation was complicated by McEwen publicly announcing that the Country Party would leave the coalition if the Liberals selected Treasurer William McMahon (the party's deputy leader).Frame (2005), p. 264. The leadership election was not held until 9 January 1968, the 23rd day after the disappearance. The four candidates were John Gorton, Paul Hasluck, Billy Snedden and Les Bury. Gorton was elected over Hasluck on the second ballot, and was sworn in as prime minister the following day ‚Äì the first senator to hold the office. In line with the constitutional convention that the prime minister must sit in the House of Representatives, he resigned from the Senate on 1 February to contest the by-election caused by Holt's death, which was held on 24 February. He won an easy victory, and was sworn in to the House on 12 March.Frame (2005), p. 269. Analysis According to his biographer, Tom Frame, \\"there could never realistically be much doubt that Harold Holt drowned ‚Äì he was simply one of the number of ordinary Australians who drown each year through poor judgment or bad luck.\\"Frame (2005), p. 295. Holt likely misjudged his own swimming ability and the roughness of the conditions, and was simply overcome by exhaustion. Alternatively, he may have suffered a heart attack, been struck by driftwood, stung by jellyfish, or attacked by a shark. Holt's body was probably either trapped below the surface or washed out to sea on the ebb tide. It was not unusual for this to occur ‚Äì three men had drowned at a beach in Rye a few years earlier, with one body disappearing and the other two ending up in different places.Holt (2005), p. 275. Sir Robert Southey, a senior figure in the Liberal Party's organisational wing, said of the events in a 1994 interview: Some have suggested that Holt entered the water primarily to impress Marjorie Gillespie, with whom he was rumoured to be having an affair. Zara believed that this was the case, and in 1988 Gillespie publicly identified herself as Holt's lover. However, in an earlier interview she had been specifically asked if their relationship was sexual in nature, and did not characterise it as such. Formal investigations The Victoria Police launched a formal investigation into Holt's disappearance the day after it occurred. Jack Ford, a former homicide detective, was chosen to head the investigation, with Aubrey Jackson of the Commonwealth Police assisting. The resulting police report was released on 5 January 1968, but did not record any definitive findings due to a lack of evidence. Senior pathologist James McNamara was consulted about what might have happened to Holt's body, and suggested that it may have been trapped by kelp and then consumed by sea creatures (specifically sharks, crayfish, and/or sea lice). If that were the case, \\"the body would have been reduced to a skeleton in a period as short as 24 to 48 hours\\". Some of those involved in the investigation later reported that certain relevant information had been deliberately omitted from the final report ‚Äì for instance, Simpson's statement that Holt had had several cans of beer in his bag.\\"The mystery of Harold Holt\\", The Gold Coast Bulletin, 30 August 2003. The federal government declined to conduct its own inquiry, as the disappearance was considered uncontroversial and his family did not want one. Until 1985, state law did not allow for the Victorian Coroners Court to conduct an inquest without the presence of a body. In August 2003, State Coroner Graeme Johnstone announced that his office had compiled a list of 103 cold cases involving suspected drownings where bodies were never recovered.Harold Holt may get his inquest ‚Äì 36 years on , The Sydney Morning Herald, 25 August 2003.

Retrieved 31 October 2017. Suggestions of suicide Some have advanced the view that Holt's death was not accidental, but rather that he chose to end his own life. Supporters of this theory claim that Holt was depressed and mentally unstable, and killed himself because he thought his political career was in jeopardy. Those who reject it point to his joie de vivre and commitment to his family, as well as the plans he had made for the coming year.Harold Holt disappearance: 48 years on and still no answers, Herald Sun, 16 December 2015. Retrieved 11 November 2017. The 1968 police report specifically ruled out suicide, as Holt had followed \\"an ordinary domestic pattern\\" in the days before his disappearance, and suicides in front of witnesses were considered atypical.Frame (2005), p. 277. Who Killed Harold Holt?, a Nine Network television documentary that aired in 2007, gave particular credence to the suicide theory, as did an article in The Bulletin published the same year. In response, Holt's son Sam gave an interview in which he said \\"there's no mystery, in essence there's no credibility at all; no one in our family believes it\\"; Zara had earlier said that her husband was \\"too selfish\\" to commit suicide. Two of Holt's former colleagues, Tony Eggleton and Malcolm Fraser, were also interviewed around the same time, and both rejected any suggestion of suicide; Alick Downer and James Killen had expressed similar sentiments in their memoirs. In contrast, Edward St John believed suicide was plausible, suggesting that Holt's death \\"appeared to be an act of a man who either wanted to die or didn't much care whether he lived or died\\". Senior public servant Sir Lenox Hewitt recalled in a 1994 interview that Holt had seemed depressed in the period before his death. Peter Butt, who produced the 2008 docudrama The Prime Minister is Missing, observed that \\"no one thought it was in his character and all those who know him dismiss the idea completely\\". Conspiracy theories Holt's disappearance spawned numerous conspiracy theories, most of which involve claims of a cover-up at the highest level of government. A 1968 story in the Sunday Observer claimed that Holt had been assassinated by the CIA, supposedly because he intended to pull Australia out of Vietnam. There were also suggestions that Holt had been killed by the North Vietnamese (after being incapacitated by a nerve agent),Frame (2005), p. 278. or that he had faked his own death to be with a lover.Frame (2005), p. 293. In 1983, British journalist Anthony Grey published The Prime Minister Was a Spy, in which he claimed that Holt was a lifelong spy for the People's Republic of China. According to Grey, Holt faked his own death in order to defect to China, and was \\"collected\\" by frogmen who dragged him to a waiting submarine. Reviewers noted multiple factual errors in the book, not least that it was physically impossible for a submarine to be positioned so close to the shore. Zara observed that her husband \\"didn't even like Chinese food\\".Frame (2005), pp. 278‚Äì292. Legacy Holt is remembered more for the circumstances of his death than for his political achievements. Sol Encel believed that his disappearance marked the end of an interregnum between the stability of Menzies and the internal conflict the Liberal Party experienced under Gorton and William McMahon. Australia had only one prime minister (Menzies) from 1949 to 1965, but then from 1966 to 1975 had six prime ministers.Frame (2005), p. 301. Peter Bowers said that Holt's death ended Australia's \\"age of innocence\\", as it meant national leaders could no longer keep their private lives completely away from public scrutiny.

Hellenistic fortifications are defense structures constructed during the Hellenistic Period of ancient Greek civilization (323 - ca. 30 B.C.E.). These included fortification walls, towers, and gates. Expansion of Greek territory during the Hellenistic Period from Alexander the Great's conquests created the necessity to build new fortifications with new settlements. This, combined with developing military technology, led to changes in style of architecture specific to the Hellenistic Period.  Historical Chronology  The Hellenistic Period was the period in Ancient Greek civilization from 323 - ca. 30 B.C.E.. It is marked by the death of Alexander the Great and ends with the rise of the Roman Empire. The period follows the conquests of Alexander the Great spreading Greek territory far into Egypt, Asia Minor, and the Middle East. The Hellenistic Period saw Greek territorial expansion at its greatest. Acquisition of new territory led to the movement of Greek people and influence throughout the Mediterranean. It also allowed for the rise of new cities. With a huge territory, being \\"Greek\\" became less of a geographic locator, and more a representation of personal cultural ties. Therefore architecture built during this time developed both a mix of canonical Greek elements and locally indigenous styles.  Fortification walls  A fortification wall seen at Alinda, Caria. The buildup of new cities required the build up of fortification walls. Fortification walls served multiple purposes for the Greeks. They served as a means of protection from invasion and as markers of territory. Walls were first constructed around the city's Acropolis, to ensure the safety of the most important part of Greek society‚Äîtheir sacred space. The extent to which the defensive walls protected only the city-center, or spread into the countryside, varied. The intensity of defense measures depended on a city's vulnerability and likelihood of attack. Therefore, it was common to see Greek civilizations purposefully located at naturally defensible locations such as mountains and rivers. These natural barriers sometimes prevented the need to build fortifications. Choosing geography as a means of defense only increased during the Hellenistic period with the development of colonies. When specifically looking to where to build a new city, rulers chose locations with defense in mind. An example of this can be seen at Mount Oreion, Corinthia. Located on the important Corinthian isthmus, the Mount Oreion mountain range provided a natural barrier for the city. In low sloping planes, such as the sites of Stanotopi and Maritsa, walls were constructed to add to protection.  Towers  Towers provided a variety of purposes for the Greeks. They were a place to store military supplies and provide lookouts out over the fortification walls. In the Hellenistic Period, there was a shift in the construction and placement of towers. This is due to the increasing necessity to have what would be the strongest defensive line. Prior to the Hellenistic Period, towers were largely simple, single-storied square buildings. Due to advances in military technology this style of tower changed. The creation of the cannon led to the development of circular or multi-angled towers rather than square shaped. The new shapes made the structure stronger against impact from a cannonball. At the start of the Hellenistic Period, towers were incorporated into the fortification walls. Moving through the Hellenistic Period, there was a shift to towers being constructed separate from the wall system. Circular or multi-angled towers would have been more difficult to incorporate into the flat-walled architecture. They were also separated due to their vulnerability to attack. If a cannon were to take down a separate tower, it would not effect the defensibility of the walls. This idea is seen specifically at Alinda, Karia. Original construction had the citadel connected in the city walls. A later construction purposefully brought the citadel outside the city defense fortifications, and away from the city center. This has been hypothesized as a decision to further protect the city, by keeping a potential military target away from the society.  Materials and construction  Olba, Cilicia showing the use of ashlar blocks. Hellenistic fortifications were built out of a variety of materials. The materials largely depended on what could be sourced locally. This provided the cheapest, most abundant option. Most common were ashlar block masonry and mud-brick. However, we also see limestone and stone filled with rubble. Mud-brick was common in colonies located around the Black Sea and Ionia. The process for mud-brick took materials of clay and water and then added sand to strengthen the consistency. The mixture was then placed in wooden molds and let to dry in the sun. In the Hellenistic period, the use of ashlar block style masonry developed. Here, blocks were evenly cut small and rectangular, to create the strongest individual block. Thus, creating stronger walls and towers. These construction projects were largely financed from public funds, rather than from individual donors as they were a public necessity.  Architecture  Colonies created during the Hellenistic period held an interesting mix of incorporating both Greek and foreign indigenous styles of Architecture. A majority of settlements around the Black Sea were founded by Miletians, therefore architectural methods and styles of the Miletians were transferred on. But, in these same colonies, there was a sense of needing to legitimize their \\"Greekness\\". New rulers wanted to prove that they were just as Greek as cities in mainland Greece. Therefore, many elements found in traditional Greek fortification walls were also seen in colonies far from the mainland. At the site of Chersonesus, blocks were cut long and flat. Masonries purposefully used a style of untrimming to give a stylistic effect common in Greek cities. In all fortification walls, one continuous idea was all walls were kept relatively low, but powerful from the use of small bricks or ashlar blocks. It was not economically resourceful to create extra-tall or extra-thick walls, when the strength in the stone itself would be defensible on its own. Walls were only made as tall or as thick as they were needed. Generally, fortifications were simple in design, their purpose was simply to defend, not to necessarily look pretty. However, Chersonesos offers a unique example of Greeks emphasizing aestetical beauty over what was most economical or defensible.

It is located on the Sorotska river and is the center of the village council with the hamlet of Bodnarka a part of it. Beginning in September 2015, Kozivka became a member of the Velyki Hai Village Council. In 2015, the village had a population of 686 people. Geography Kozivka is the last village belonging to the Ternopil Raion. The neighboring village of Sorotske, with which Kozivka borders, belongs to the Terebovlia Raion. Kozivka is located in the south-eastern part of the Ternopil Raion. The distance to Ternopil, the administrative center of Ternopil Oblast, from the village is approximately 25 km. The distance to the nearest railway station, which is in Proshova, is 8 km. In addition to the Sorotske, Kozivka borders other villages as Mahdalivka, which belongs to the Pidvolochysk Raion, Hrabovets and Skomorokhy, which belong to the Ternopil Raion. The nearest village settlement for Koizivka is Sorotske, approximately 2 km away. Topography The village is located on Podolian Upland. Therefore, the territory of the village is predominantly a plain. Only in isolated places there are such forms of relief as hills and valleys. Through the village, Sorotska river flows which divides the village into approximately two equal parts. The climate of Kozivka is moderately continental, with warm damp summer and mild winters. History The original settlement was first mentioned in written sources in 1564 under the name Lozivka (–õ–æ–∑—ñ–≤–∫–∞). On November 23, 1918, the Polish section under the command of Colonel Czes≈Çaw Rybinsko, formed in Odessa, crossed the border near Sataniv and headed for Ternopil. It consisted of 22 officers and 700 soldiers. Colonel of the West Ukrainian People's Republic, Dmytro Vitovsky, sent Sich Riflemen to meet them, who on November 27 near the village of Kozivka surrounded the Polish detachment and captured them. The rest of the group that remained in Mykulyntsi surrendered with the prisoners taken to Ternopil. In the village, a military organization Zwiazek Strzelecki (Riflemen's Association) was created, whose members brutally beat Ukrainians who wore embroidered shirts. Other Polish societies such as Dom ludowy and Ko≈Çko rolnicze were also organized. An outpost of OUN (Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists) was established in 1939, headed by Mikhailo Poliak, Joseph Hyrun and Ivan Petriek. Bolshevik rule returned to the village on March 22, 1944. A collective farm in Kozivka was established in 1945. Demographics At present, 686 people live in the village. The village consists of 99.6% Ukrainians own, and 0.4% Georgians. Before the World War II, the village consisted of almost 500 properties and 2,500 inhabitants, including 85 Poles and 46 Jews. As in most villages in Ukraine, the aging of the nation takes place in Kozivka due to the negative natural growth and high mortality in the village. There is also a resettlement of young villagers moving to cities. In the last decade, the number of inhabitants sharply decreased (for 10 years the number of inhabitants in the village has practically decreased by 100 people). The population in the village consists of 57% women, and men - 43%. Religion The Church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker was constructed in 1888 out of stone. The priest is Father Vasyl Brehin who is the deacon of the Velyki Birky deanery. Monuments Several monuments are present such as a Cossack grave which has been preserved, a memorable cross erected in honor of the abolition of serfdom in 1848, monuments to soldiers and fellow villagers who died in World War II (1968) and Stepan Bandera (1992).

The NIFES is the largest Christian Campus movement in Africa with secretariats in almost all Nigerian tertiary institutions. The movement which started on 31 August 1968 is the Nigerian division of the worldwide umbrella organisation the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (IFES), which is the largest Christian campus movement in the world currently covering 160 evangelical Christian students movements in over 160 countries. History The formation of the NIFES saw the beginning of the evangelical students movement in Nigeria which started when some British graduates from the Inter- Varsity Fellowship of the UK initiated annual camps through which a number of African students‚Äô leaders emerged and caught a vision for starting students groups, and there was a need to start an evangelical movement in Africa. The Pan-African Fellowship of Evangelical Students (PAFES) came into being with a vision to encourage national movements in all the countries involved with her in the African continent. The first Nigerian PAFES conference was held at Ilesha from 31 August to 4 September 1967. Based on the challenge from the then Traveling Secretary, PAFES (W.A) Mr. Geotfried Osei Mensah on the formation of a Nigerian national movement, and a motion to that effect by Mr. (now Prof.) Kayode Adesogan a constitution drafting committee headed by Mr. (now Prof.) Ebong Mbipom as chairman and Mr. (now Rev. (Dr)) Kunle Obadina as secretary was constituted. At the end of the year, the committee produced its first version of the NIFES constitution and also planned the 1st National Conference. On 31 August 1968, members from eleven evangelical groups in post secondary institutions in Nigeria met at Bishop Smith Memorial College, Ilorin, Kwara State and decided to pass the draft constitution and to make themselves available to God‚Äôs service in extending His kingdom in Nigeria tertiary institutions through a National Movement known as Nigeria Fellowship of Evangelical Students. From that small beginning in 1968, NIFES has been able to mobilize over 80,000 students in about 300 Universities and Colleges all over Nigeria through Bible Studies, Prayer Meeting, Biblical Discipleship and Leadership Training. Prior to the formation of NIFES, Christian students who had benefited from the Ministry of Scripture Union (S.U) and Fellowship Christian Students (F.C.S) in their secondary schools were getting involved with Christian lecturers who invited them for prayers, Bible studies and higher learning. From such interaction the need arose for more regular fellowship meetings and this went on till 1968 when at a Conference in Ilorin, Kwara State NIFES was formally inaugurated as a movement founded by the students themselves. Mission NIFES is a national, non-denominational, evangelical Christian movement, primarily reaching out to students in tertiary institutions across Nigeria. A national movement evidenced by its presence in all the 36 states of the federation including the FCT. NIFES works in over 294 campuses with about 30,000 Christian students involved. NIFES is affiliated to the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (IFES) with membership in 150 countries of the world. NIFES is by God‚Äôs Grace, the largest Christian Student Movement operating in Universities and colleges worldwide within the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students. NIFES, by its composition and functional scope, stands as a symbol of unity among Christian Students of various denominations and believers of different ethnic identities.

B.C.jpg The Grave Monument from Kallithea is a tomb of a family of metics from Histria (Nikeratos and his son Polyxenos), which was excavated in Kallithea (Athens, Greece). The monument itself dates back to around 320 BC and contains a polychrome frieze. It is currently located at the Piraeus Archaeological Museum. This grave monument was built outside the Long Walls leading to Piraeus.  Architectural style  The grave monument is composed of a limestone podium, which supports a marble pedestal with steps. On top of that, there are 3 statues inside an Ionic naiskos (a small temple). The three statues inside are of a family. The one on the far left is of Nikeratos, who wears a himation. The center statue is of his son, Polyxenos, who is depicted as a naked athlete in the contrapposto pose. The statue on the right is of one of the family's slave boys. The father and the slave boy and both in a static pose. All three have the softened musculature indicative of the Hellenistic period. The monument has noticeably aged. Limestone, a softer rock, has caused the podium to lose a few large chunks due to weathering. The marble pedestal has a few large cracks and a couple small missing pieces. The main frieze was done in relief. It depicts an Amazonomachy, where Greeks fought the tribe of warrior women. There is a blank area between two sections of the relief frieze, which may have been a painted frieze that has faded away with time. The naiskos is in a rather poor condition as all three statues inside have had their heads fall off.  Comparison to contemporaries  This grave monument is fairly reflective of others in the late 4th century BC. It depicts conspicuous consumption, as only the wealthy could afford something this extravagant. In 317/316 BC, grave monuments were banned under Demetrios of Phaleron's anti-luxury decree. Conspicuous monuments such as this one may have been the impetus behind the passage of the law.  References  Sources * Miles, Margaret (2016). A Companion to Greek Architecture.

He showed very good form as a two-year-old, winning the Group 2 Mill Reef Stakes on his second racecourse appearance. In the following year he emerged as one of the best sprinters in Europe with wins in the Sandy Lane Stakes, July Cup and Haydock Sprint Cup. In 2018 he won the Duke of York Stakes but was injured when he trapped a leg in the starting gate at Royal Ascot. Background Harry Angel is a bay horse bred in Ireland by CBS Bloodstock. As a yearling he was consigned to the Goffs sale in August 2015 and was bought for ¬£44,000 by Clive Cox Racing Limited. He entered the ownership of Peter Ridgers and was taken into training by Cox at Lambourn, Berkshire. He has been ridden in all of his races by Adam Kirby. His sire Dark Angel won four races including the Mill Reef Stakes and the Middle Park Stakes as a two-year-old in 2007 before being retired to stud at the end of the year. Dark Angel's other offspring have included Lethal Force, Mecca's Angel and Persuasive. Harry Angel's dam Beatrix Potter showed very limited racing ability managing two second places in fifteen starts. She was descended from Avum, a half-sister to Lord Avie. Racing career 2016: two-year-old season Harry Angel made his racecourse debut in a novice race (for horses with no more than one previous win) over five furlongs at Ascot Racecourse on 7 May. He finished strongly but failed by a nose to overhaul the odds-on favourite Reach High. After an absence of over four months, Harry Angel returned in the Group 2 Mill Reef Stakes over six furlongs at Newbury Racecourse. He was made the 2/1 favourite ahead of six opponents headed by Global Applause (National Stakes) and Legendary Lunch (Woodcote Stakes). After tracking the leaders, he took the lead a furlong out and was \\"pushed out\\" by Kirby to win by two and a half lengths from Perfect Angel. 2017: three- year-old season On his first run of 2017 Harry Angel finished second in the Pavilion Stakes at Ascot Racecourse on 3 May, beaten one and a half lengths by the Godolphin colt Blue Point, to whom he was conceding four pounds in weight. At the end of the month he was made 5/6 favourite for the Group 2 Sandy Lane Stakes on firm ground at Haydock Park. He led from the start and pulled clear in the final furlong to win by four and half lengths from the Spring Cup winner Second Thought. After this race he was bought privately by Godolphin but remained in training with Cox. The Group 1 Commonwealth Cup at Royal Ascot in June saw Harry Angel again matched against Blue Point and the colts started second and third in the betting behind the undefeated Irish challenger Caravaggio. Harry Angel led the race from the start and turned back the challenge of Blue Point but was overtaken by Caravaggio in the closing stages and beaten three-quarters of a length into second. The July Cup at Newmarket Racecourse on 15 July saw Harry Angel compete against older horses for the first time and he started 9/2 third choice in the betting behind Caravaggio and the five-year-old gelding Limato. The other seven runners included The Tin Man (British Champions Sprint Stakes, Diamond Jubilee Stakes), Tasleet (Duke of York Stakes) and Brando (Ayr Gold Cup, Abernant Stakes). Kirby positioned the colt in second behind the pacemaker Intelligence Cross before going to the front approaching the final furlong and Harry Angel kept on well to win by one and a quarter lengths from Limato, with Brando taking third ahead of Caravaggio. After the race Cox said \\"We came here with a really good feel,\\" Cox said. \\"The instinctive impression was very good all the way, from the minute he came off the track at Ascot, and I‚Äôm so proud that he's delivered in the fashion we thought was possible. He's grown up and become a man. Adam said that just when he wanted to get a blow into him at Ascot, he had to ask him to go. The choke was out all the way. This was one of the nicest July Cups I‚Äôve seen in my lifetime, and I‚Äôm very proud to have won it\\". On 9 September Harry Angel started 2/1 favourite for the 32Red Sprint Cup on heavy ground at Haydock Park. His opponents included, Tasleet, The Tin Man, Brando (who had won the Prix Maurice de Gheest in August) and Blue Point as well as Magical Memory (Stewards' Cup) and Queen Kindly (Lowther Stakes). Harry Angel made all the running, kicked away from his rivals a furlong out and won in \\"impressive\\" style by four lengths from Tasleet. Cox explained that he had been worried by the state of the ground and had only made the final decision to run the colt half an hour before the race. Adam Kirby commented \\"he's a machine. He's got speed to burn and I knew he‚Äôd won as soon as he picked up. He's highly strung and the main thing is to be cool... There's more to come\\". On his final run of the season the colt started the 5/4 favourite for the British Champions Sprint Stakes at Ascot on 21 October. He took the lead two furlongs out but was overtaken entering the final furlong and finished fourth behind Librisa Breeze, Tasleet and Caravaggio. 2018: four-year-old season On 16 May 2018, Harry Angel, carrying a five-pound weight penalty, was sent off 4/9 favourite in a five-runner field for the Group 2 Duke of York Stakes at York Racecourse. Ridden by Kirby he took the lead in the last quarter mile and won by two lengths from Brando, winner of his previous start in the Group 3 Abernant Stakes. At Royal Ascot in the following month he was made favourite for the Diamond Jubilee Stakes but his run of bad luck at the course continued as he went lame during the race and finished unplaced. He was found to have sustained a deep cut when trapping his leg in the starting stalls. He returned for the Sprint Cup at Haydock in September and ran well for a long way before tiring into sixth place behind The Tin Man. On 20 October he ran for the second time in the British Champions Sprint Stakes. After being reluctant to enter the stalls he was among the leaders from the start and kept on well to finish second behind the 28/1 outsider Sands of Mali. The horses finishing behind included Brando, The Tin Man, Limato and Librisa Breeze. On 24 October it was announced that Harry Angel had been retired from racing and would stand as a breeding stallion at Dalham Hall Stud in 2019. Assessment and awards On 16 November 2017 at the Cartier Racing Awards, Harry Angel was named Champion Sprinter. In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Harry Angel was rated the seventh-best horse in the world and the best sprinter.

Silkman was graduated at Yale University in 1845, studied law, and after laboring as a journalist, was admitted to the bar in 1850, soon establishing a good practice. Prior to the American Civil War, he caused much excitement by introducing resolutions against slavery in the New York diocesan convention of the Protestant Episcopal church. After the war, he became greatly interested in religious matters, and was at one time identified With the Fulton street prayer-meeting. Subsequently, he was converted to Spiritualism, and remained until his death one of its foremost adherents. So pronounced were his views on this subject that his family had him examined to decide with regard to his sanity, and in 1883, he was committed to the Utica asylum. From this decision, he appealed, and after a long litigation in the courts, he recovered a verdict of US$15,000 damages against his son and his son-in-law for false imprisonment. An appeal from this verdict was nearing at the time of his death. On being released from Utica, he reopened his law- office and recovered a portion of his practice, but made the chief aim of his life thereafter to procure the release of those inmates of the Utica asylum that he claimed were unjustly confined. In this, owing to his ability as a lawyer and his persistence, he was unusually successful, and a number were released at different times through his efforts. Early life and education James Bailey Silkman was born in Bedford, New York, on October 9, 1819, the son of Daniel Silkman, of Dutch descent, and Sarah (Bailey) Silkman. In his childhood his father met with the loss of his property, and the son's preparation for college (entering Yale University in the Sophomore year) was thereby deferred. Career He taught school after graduation, as he had done before. In the fall of 1846, entered the law office of Theodore Sedgwick, Esq., in New York City. Before long, however, he procured through Sedgwick's influence a position as assistant editor of the New York Evening Post; this he resigned after two years, to become night editor of the New York Courier and Enquirer, while continuing law studies. In December, 1850, he was admitted to the bar, devoting himself to real estate and office practice. In politics, originally a Democrat, his anti-slavery zeal drove him to become a Republican. During the Civil War, he was an active supporter of the Union. For many years, he gave much attention to Sunday school work and the temperance cause, and was a prominent figure in the Fulton-street prayer-meeting. Eventually, he became an ardent Spiritualist, and in 1882, was placed by some of his relatives under restraint in an insane asylum. Litigation ensued, which resulted in his release, and he gave much of his time afterwards to the investigation of cases alleged to be of a similar character, including that of Clarissa Caldwell Lathrop, who detailed her confinement in A Secret Institution. Personal life In 1856 he married Harriette V. C., daughter of the Rev. Alexander H. Crosby, Rector of the Episcopal Church in Yonkers, New York, where Silkman afterwards resided. In January, 1888, he had a bout of pneumonia, from which he partially recovered, but heart failure resulted in his death, at a hospital in New York City, on February 4, 1888, in his 69th year.

Some of these projects, such as subway line automation, proposed platform screen doors, the FASTRACK maintenance program, and infrastructural improvements proposed in 2015‚Äì2019 Capital Program, contribute toward improving the system's efficiency. Others, such as train-arrival \\"countdown clocks\\", \\"Help Point\\" station intercoms, \\"On the Go! Travel Station\\" passenger kiosks, wireless and cellular network connections in stations, MetroCard fare payment alternatives, and digital ads, are meant to benefit individual passengers. Yet others, including the various methods of subway construction, do not directly impact the passenger interface, but are used to make subway operations efficient. In the mid-1990s, it started converting the BMT Canarsie Line to use communications-based train control, using a moving block signal system that allowed more trains to use the tracks and thus increasing passenger capacity. After the Canarsie Line tests were successful, the MTA expanded the automation program in the 2000s and 2010s to include other lines. This led to a 2017 proposal to install platform screen doors in one Canarsie Line station. Additionally, as part of another program called FASTRACK, the MTA started closing certain lines during weekday nights in 2012, with each of the lines closing overnight for a week in order to allow workers to clean these lines without being hindered by train movements. The program was expanded beyond Manhattan the next year after noticing how efficient the FASTRACK program was compared to previous service diversions. In 2015, the MTA announced a wide-ranging improvement program as part of the 2015‚Äì2019 Capital Program. Thirty stations would be extensively rebuilt under the Enhanced Station Initiative, and new R211 subway cars would be able to fit more passengers. The MTA has also started some projects to improve passenger amenities. It added train arrival \\"countdown clocks\\" to most A Division (numbered route) stations and the BMT Canarsie Line () by late 2011, allowing passengers on these routes to see train arrival times using real-time data. A similar countdown-clock project for the B Division (lettered routes) and the IRT Flushing Line was deferred until 2016, when a new Bluetooth-based clock system was tested successfully. Beginning in 2011, the MTA installed \\"Help Point\\" to aid with emergency calls or station agent assistance, in all stations. Interactive touchscreen \\"On The Go! Travel Station\\" kiosks, which give station advisories, itineraries, and timetables, were installed starting in 2011. Cellular phone and wireless data in stations, first installed in 2011 as part of a pilot program, was expanded systemwide due to positive passenger feedback. Additionally, credit-card trials at several subway stations in 2006 and 2010 led to proposals for OMNY, a contactless payment system to replace the aging MetroCard system used to pay fares on MTA-operated transportation. Finally, in 2017, the MTA started installing digital advertisements in trains and stations.  Construction methods  Cross-section of the first subway the first IRT subway line, pictured at 59th Street ‚Äì Columbus Circle, cut-and- cover was used as a form of construction. extension of the IRT Flushing Line (pictured) use tunnel boring machines to build the subway tunnels. When the IRT subway debuted in 1904,James Blaine Walker, Fifty Years of Rapid Transit, 1864‚Äì1917, published 1918, pp. 162‚Äì191 the typical tunnel construction method was cut-and-cover. The street was torn up to dig the tunnel below before being rebuilt from above. Traffic on the street above would be interrupted due to the digging up of the street. Temporary steel and wooden bridges carried surface traffic above the construction. The 7,700 workers who built the original subway lines were mostly immigrants living in Manhattan. Contractors in this type of construction faced many obstacles, both natural and man-made. They had to deal with rock formations, and ground water, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, electric conduits, and New York City steam system pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability. This method worked well for digging soft dirt and gravel near the street surface. However, tunnelling shields were required for deeper sections, such as the Harlem and East River tunnels, which used cast-iron tubes. Segments between 33rd and 42nd streets under Park Avenue, 116th Street and 120th Street under Broadway, and 145th Street and Dyckman Street (Fort George) under Broadway and Saint Nicholas Avenue as well as the tunnel from 96th Street to Central Park North‚Äì110th Street & Lenox Avenue, used either rock or concrete-lined tunnels. About 40% of the subway system runs on surface or elevated tracks, including steel or cast iron elevated structures, concrete viaducts, embankments, open cuts and surface routes. All of these construction methods are completely grade-separated from road and pedestrian crossings, and most crossings of two subway tracks are grade-separated with flying junctions. The sole level junctions of two lines in regular revenue service are the 142nd Street junction and the Myrtle Avenue junction. More recent projects use tunnel boring machines, which minimize disruption at street level and avoid already existing utilities, but increase cost. Examples of such projects include the extension of the IRT Flushing Line and the IND Second Avenue Line.  Automation and signaling  This is a punch box, used for signaling to a tower operator which line the train should use at a junction. This technology is no longer in use on the IRT (A Division); the signal system that allows countdown clocks also automates train identification and switching. The MTA has plans to upgrade much of New York City Subway system from a fixed block signaling system to one with communications-based train control (CBTC) technology, which will control the speed and starting and stopping of subway trains. The CBTC system is mostly automated and uses a moving block system ‚Äì which reduces headways between trains, increases train frequencies and capacities, and relays the trains' positions to a control room ‚Äì rather than a fixed block system. This will require new rolling stock to be built for the subway system, as only newer trains can use CBTC systems. Trains using CBTC locate themselves based on measuring their distance past fixed transponders installed between the rails. Trains equipped with CBTC have a transponder interrogator antenna beneath each carriage, which communicates with the fixed trackside transponders and report the trains' location to a wayside Zone Controller via radio. Then, the Controller issues Movement Authorities to the trains. This technology upgrade will allow trains to be operated at closer distances, slightly increasing capacity; will allow the MTA to keep track of trains in real time and provide more information to the public regarding train arrivals and delays; and will obviate the need for complex interlocking towers. The trains are also equipped with high-tech computers inside the cab so that the conductor could monitor the train's speed and relative location. First two lines The BMT Canarsie Line () was the first line to implement the automated technology using Siemens's Trainguard MT CBTC system, as it was a self-contained line with none of the route interlining seen elsewhere around the system. The CBTC project was first proposed in 1994 and approved by the MTA in 1997. Installation of the signal system was begun in 2000. Initial testing began in 2004, and installation was mostly completed by December 2006, with all CBTC-equipped R143 subway cars in service by that date. Due to an unexpected ridership increase on the Canarsie Line, the MTA ordered more R160 cars and these were put into service in 2010. This enabled the agency to operate up to 26 trains per hour up from the May 2007 service level of 15 trains per hour, an achievement that would not be possible without the CBTC technology or a redesign of the previous automatic block signal system. The R143s and R160s both use Trainguard MT CBTC, supplied by Siemens. The next line to have CBTC installed was the pre-existing IRT Flushing Line and its western extension opened in 2015 (served by the ). The Flushing Line was chosen for the second implementation of CBTC because it is also a self- contained line with no direct connections to other subway lines currently in use. The 2010‚Äì2014 capital budget provided funding for CBTC installation on the Flushing Line, with scheduled installation originally set for completion in 2016. The R188 cars were ordered in 2010 to equip the line with compatible rolling stock. This order consists of new cars and retrofits of existing R142A cars for CBTC. However, the CBTC retrofit date was later pushed back to 2017 or 2018. The installation is being done by Thales Group. Expansion Siemens and Thales successfully conducted tests on one of the IND Culver Line's tracks to determine if their CBTC systems were compatible, thus allowing installation of CBTC on the rest of the B Division. In 2016, Siemens and Thales were awarded a contract to install CBTC on the IND Queens Boulevard Line from 50th Street/8th Avenue and 47th‚Äì50th Streets‚ÄìRockefeller Center to Kew Gardens‚ÄìUnion Turnpike. Planning for phase one started in 2015 and was complete by February 2016, with major engineering work following in November 2016.Install Communication-Based Train Control on the Queens Boulevard Line West - Phase 2 Funding for CBTC on the IND Eighth Avenue Line from 59th Street‚ÄìColumbus Circle to High Street is also provided in the 2015‚Äì2019 Capital Program, along with the modernization of interlockings at 30th and 42nd Streets. The local tracks of the IND Culver Line would also get CBTC as part of the 2015‚Äì2019 Capital Program, as well as the entire line between Church Avenue and West Eighth Street‚ÄìNew York Aquarium, with three interlockings to be upgraded on that stretch. , MTA projects that 355 miles of track will receive CBTC signals by 2029, including most of the IND, as well as the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and the BMT Broadway Line. The MTA also is planning to install CBTC equipment on the IND Crosstown Line, the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and the BMT Brighton Line before 2025. Additionally, the New York City Subway uses a system known as Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) for dispatching and train routing on the A Division (the Flushing line, and the trains used on the , do not have ATS.) ATS allows dispatchers in the Operations Control Center (OCC) to see where trains are in real time, and whether each individual train is running early or late. Dispatchers can hold trains for connections, re-route trains, or short-turn trains to provide better service when a disruption causes delays.  Other ideas  In 2017, the MTA started testing ultra-wideband radio-enabled train signaling on the IND Culver Line. The ultra-wideband train signals would be able to carry more data wirelessly in a manner similar to CBTC, but can be installed faster. The ultra-wideband signals would have the added benefit of allowing passengers to use cellphones while between stations, instead of the current setup (see ) that only provides cellphone signals within the stations. Platform screen doors The MTA has long been reluctant to install platform screen doors in the subway system, though it had been considering such an idea since the 1980s. Originally, it was planned to install platform doors in several stations along the Second Avenue Subway, but their installation presented substantial technical challenges, as there are different placements of doors on New York City Subway rolling stock. The Second Avenue Subway screen-door was scrapped in 2012 as cost-prohibitive.NYC Subway Deaths Spur Officials to Call for Action , The Epoch Times.CUSTOMER CONTACT WITH TRAIN INCIDENT REPORT, January 2013. The MTA is also interested in retrofitting platform screen doors on the Canarsie Line, along the , and on the IRT Flushing Line, along the . However, it is unlikely that the entire New York City Subway system will get retrofitted with platform screen doors or automatic platform gatesCapital New York: After subway-push killings (and Lhota's resignation), the MTA considers platform screen doors due to, again, the varying placements of doors on rolling stock.Council demands an end to the M.T.A.‚Äòs subway-safety ‚Äôexploratory' phase Following a series of incidents during one week in November 2016, in which 3 people were injured or killed after being pushed into tracks, the MTA started to consider installing platform edge doors for the 42nd Street Shuttle. By 2017, a pilot program for platform screen door technology was underway at the Pelham Parkway station in the Bronx. In October 2017, it was announced that as part of a pilot program, the Canarsie Line's Third Avenue station was planned to be refitted with platform screen doors while the 14th Street Tunnel was rebuilt from April 2019 to March 2020. This was possible as a result of the L train's automated train operation. The MTA would have used the results of the pilot in order to determine the feasibility of adding such doors citywide. The PSDs would have been approximately high and would have been coordinated with the location of the subway car doors when a train was in the station. To ensure that the subway cars were precisely lined up with the doors, a wayside-only berthing system would be installed. Emergency egress gates would be installed in between the regular doors to allow people to exit in the case of an emergency. The platform edges and topping would be removed and replaced so that they align with the sills of the train doors and to be in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. To ensure that people do not get trapped in between the subway car doors and the PSDs, sensors and CCTV cameras would be installed with monitors at the center and front of the platforms visible to the train operator and conductor. In June 2018, the $30 million for the platform edge door pilot program was diverted to another project, and the pilot program was postponed until sufficient funding could be found. However, stations constructed as part of the Second Avenue Subway's Phase 2 may receive platform screen doors depending on the results of studies being conducted for their installation elsewhere. Air conditioning in stations Seven of the New York City Subway's stations contain artificial air-condition systems. The air-cooling systems are mostly located in subway stations that were built in the 21st century. In August 2006, the MTA revealed that all new subway stations would be outfitted with air-cooling systems to reduce the temperature along platforms by as much as . The stations with artificial cooling systems are the Grand Central‚Äì42nd Street station on the ; the Cortlandt Street and South Ferry stations on the , which both replaced older stations; the 34th Street‚ÄìHudson Yards station on the ; and three stations on the Second Avenue Subway. FASTRACK FASTRACK on the IND Eighth Avenue Line at 14th StreetIn January 2012, the MTA introduced a new maintenance program, FASTRACK, to speed up repair work. This program involves a more drastic approach than previous construction, and completely shuts down a major portion of a line for overnight work on four consecutive weeknights from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. According to the MTA, this new program proved much more efficient and quicker than regular service changes, especially because it happened at night and not the weekend, when most transit closures had occurred before. In 2012 the program only closed lines in Midtown and Lower Manhattan,The corridors repaired in 2012 were: * IRT Lexington Avenue Line from Grand Central‚Äì42nd Street to Atlantic Avenue‚ÄìBarclays Center * IND Sixth Avenue Line from 59th Street‚ÄìColumbus Circle to West Fourth Street‚ÄìWashington Square * IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line from 34th Street‚ÄìPenn Station to Atlantic Avenue‚ÄìBarclays Center * IND Eighth Avenue Line from 59th Street‚ÄìColumbus Circle to Jay Street‚ÄìMetroTech but due to the success of the program, the MTA decided to expand it to the outer boroughs as well. In 2013, FASTRACK was expanded to other corridors requiring minimal shuttle busesThe corridors repaired in 2013 were: * BMT Broadway Line from Queensboro Plaza to Court Street * IND Eighth Avenue Line from 168th Street to Inwood‚Äì207th Street * IND Concourse Line from 161st Street‚ÄìYankee Stadium to Norwood‚Äì205th Street * IND Queens Boulevard Line from Fifth Avenue/53rd Street to Jackson Heights‚ÄìRoosevelt Avenue * IRT Nostrand Avenue Line from Franklin Avenue to Flatbush Avenue‚ÄìBrooklyn College * IND Concourse/Eighth Avenue lines from 59th Street‚ÄìColumbus Circle to 161st Street‚ÄìYankee Stadium and 168th Street, respectively * BMT Nassau Street Line from Broad Street to Essex Street * BMT Fourth Avenue Line from 36th Street to Bay Ridge‚Äì95th Street * IRT Lexington Avenue Line from Grand Central‚Äì42nd Street to 125th Street and in 2014 to even more locations. There were corridors scheduled for 2014 during 24 weeks of the year,The corridors repaired in 2014 were: * IRT Lexington Avenue Line from Grand Central‚Äì42nd Street to Atlantic Avenue‚ÄìBarclays Center * IRT Lexington Avenue Line from Grand Central‚Äì42nd Street to 125th Street * IND Sixth Avenue Line from 59th Street‚ÄìColumbus Circle to West Fourth Street‚ÄìWashington Square * IND Sixth Avenue Line from West Fourth Street‚ÄìWashington Square to Jay Street‚ÄìMetroTech * IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line from 34th Street‚ÄìPenn Station to Atlantic Avenue‚ÄìBarclays Center * IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line from 96th Street to Dyckman Street * IRT Eastern Parkway Line from Atlantic Avenue‚ÄìBarclays Center to Franklin Avenue * BMT Broadway Line from Queensboro Plaza to Court Street * IND Eighth Avenue Line from 59th Street‚ÄìColumbus Circle to Jay Street‚ÄìMetroTech * IND Eighth Avenue Line from 168th Street to Inwood‚Äì207th Street * IND Concourse/Eighth Avenue lines from 59th Street‚ÄìColumbus Circle to 161st Street‚ÄìYankee Stadium and 168th Street, respectively * IND Concourse Line from 161st Street‚ÄìYankee Stadium to Norwood‚Äì205th Street * IND Queens Boulevard Line from Fifth Avenue/53rd Street to Jackson Heights‚ÄìRoosevelt Avenue * BMT Fourth Avenue Line from 36th Street to Bay Ridge‚Äì95th Street * IND Fulton Street Line between Jay Street‚ÄìMetroTech and Broadway Junction * IND Crosstown Line from Bedford‚ÄìNostrand Avenues to Hoyt‚ÄìSchermerhorn Streets 12 corridors scheduled during 22 weeks in 2015, and 13 corridors scheduled during 21 weeks in 2016. As part of an $836 million program to resolve the subway's 2017 state of emergency, MTA Chairman Joe Lhota announced the expansion of the FASTRACK program in order to fix critical infrastructure faster. 2015‚Äì2019 Capital Program overhaul Enhanced Station Initiative The 2015‚Äì2019 MTA Capital Plan included funds for the Enhanced Station Initiative (ESI), under which thirty-three stations in all five boroughs would undergo a complete overhaul and would be entirely closed for up to 6 months at a time. The 34th Street‚ÄìPenn Station stops on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line and IND Eighth Avenue Line were added to the plan later, but would not be entirely closed due to their key location. The 30 original stations as part of the ESI would be rebuilt for $881 million, the two Penn Station stops would be rebuilt for $40 million, and the Richmond Valley stop on the Staten Island Railway would be rebuilt for $15 million. Five stations on the Metro-North Railroad were added to the plan in December 2017, as were sixteen stations on the Long Island Rail Road, which were proposed in several phases. Updates included cellular service, Wi-Fi, charging stations, interactive service advisories and maps, improved signage, strip maps for the subway routes, subway countdown clocks, service alerts, On-The-Go Informational Dashboards, neighborhood maps, new art, and improved station lighting. Cables and conduits were decluttered, simplifying the stations' wiring. The stations also included glass barriers near fare control areas (rather than the metal fences that separate the paid and unpaid areas of the stations), as well as new tiled floors that are easy to clean. Concrete repairs, new platform edges, waterproofing, most tile patching, and structural steel repairs got the stations into states of good repair. Passenger amenities included next-train countdown clocks and neighborhood wayfinding maps at the exterior of each entrance; digital maps, MetroCard vending machines, and station agent booths situated in a central location in the mezzanine; and digital next-train information and service change notices at platform level. One additional station, Richmond Valley of the Staten Island Railway, was also overhauled, without being closed. The renovations were done in several stages called \\"packages\\", which allowed contractors to renovate three to five stations in a given area simultaneously. The first four packages were completed in 23 months, by early 2019. The first package consisted of the Prospect Avenue, 53rd Street and Bay Ridge Avenue stations along the BMT Fourth Avenue Line in Brooklyn, for which the contract was awarded on November 30, 2016. From March to June 2017, these stations closed for construction, reopening from September to November 2017.The second group of stations, comprising the 30th Avenue, Broadway, 36th Avenue, and 39th Avenue stations on the BMT Astoria Line in Queens, was awarded on April 14, 2017, to Skanska USA, and entailed renovating these stations on a staggered schedule from October 2017 to February 2019. Originally, this package entailed renovating one platform at a time since the stations are all consecutive, unlike in other packages, but the plan was later amended so two sets of two non-consecutive stations would be completely closed at once. The third package of stations was on the IND Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan. The 163rd Street, 110th Street, 86th Street, and 72nd Street stations were included as part of an amendment to the Capital Program. The New York City Transit and Bus Committee officially recommended that the MTA Board award the $111 million contract for Package 3 to ECCO III Enterprises in October 2017. These stations were closed on a staggered schedule between March and June 2018, and reopened between September and November 2018. The fourth package of stations consisted of stations in midtown Manhattan, and included the 34th Street‚ÄìPenn Station stops on the IND Eighth Avenue Line and the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line, 57th Street and 23rd Street on the IND Sixth Avenue Line, and 28th Street on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line. These stations, except the two 34th Street‚ÄìPenn Station stops, were closed between July and December 2018. The fifth and final package for the New York City Subway included the remaining three stations in upper Manhattan and the southwest Bronx: 145th Street on the IRT Lenox Avenue Line, and 167th Street and 174th‚Äì175th Streets on the IND Concourse Line. It was originally the eighth of eight planned packages. The 145th Street station was closed between July and November 2018, while the Concourse Line stations was closed from August 2018 to December 2018. An additional package included the Metro-North Railroad stations at White Plains, Harlem‚Äì125th Street, Crestwood, Port Chester, and Riverdale. The ESI program formerly contained thirteen more stations in three packages numbered 5 through 7, but these were deferred to the 2020-2024 Capital Program due to a lack of funding. The fifth package of stations would have been in northern and eastern Brooklyn, along with Richmond Valley of the SIR. This package would have included Flushing Avenue and Classon Avenue on the IND Crosstown Line, and Van Siclen Avenue, Kingston‚ÄìThroop Avenues, and Clinton‚ÄìWashington Avenues on the IND Fulton Street Line. The sixth package would have included stations in the eastern and northern Bronx, comprising Pelham Parkway on the IRT Dyre Avenue Line, as well as Third Avenue‚Äì138th Street, Brook Avenue, East 149th Street, and Westchester Square‚ÄìEast Tremont Avenue on the IRT Pelham Line. The seventh package would have included three stations on the IND Queens Boulevard Line: Northern Boulevard, 67th Avenue, and Parsons Boulevard. In July 2017, after Package 1 had been assigned, the nonprofit Citizens Budget Commission released a study critical of the plan. In the study, the CBC noted that the 30 original stations only constituted 8% of weekday boardings, and none of these stations were in the list of 25 most-used stations in 2016. Compared to stations that would only be \\"renewed\\" under this Capital Plan, i.e. with less comprehensive improvements performed under partial closures, the average ESI station could be 2 to 2.5 times as expensive as the average non-ESI station. The CBC wrote that the MTA had added $857 million to the ESI's original $64 million in funding, and that the cost of extensive renovations offset the savings afforded by using design‚Äìbuild contracts for ESI projects. The ESI program has also been criticized for the full station closures that entails, which force riders to walk to the next station and add extra time to their commute. Some transit advocates have also pointed out that the Enhanced Station Initiative does not include improvements, such as elevators, that would make the stations compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. In January 2018, the NYCT and Bus Committee recommended that Judlau Contracting receive the $125 million contract for Package 4 and that Citnalta-Forte receive the $125 million contract for Package 8. However, the MTA Board temporarily deferred the vote for these packages after city representatives refused to vote to award the contracts, citing the high cost and relatively low importance of the program. Some executives had pointed out that improving subway service was more important than renovating stations that were used by relatively few people. In response, MTA Chairman Joe Lhota said that these stations had been selected because ESI was a \\"pilot\\" program, and thus, the renovations would be tested on smaller stations first. NYCT Chairman Andy Byford looked over the list of ESI stations and concluded that the list was suitable because these stations were in need of structural improvements. He said that the MTA's decision to not add elevators was reasonable because the work involved would have delayed many of the projects for several years, and in some cases, other nearby stops already had or were getting elevators. The ESI packages were put back for a vote in February, and the two contracts were ultimately approved, with three city representatives dissenting. In April 2018, Lhota announced that cost overruns had forced the MTA to reduce the number of subway stations included in the program from 33 stations to 19. The 19 subway stations still part of the program include those in Packages 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8, although the Staten Island Railway's Richmond Valley station from package 5 would still be included. Most of the $936 million allocated to the ESI was already used for the 19 stations underway. During the work, contractors had discovered additional infrastructure issues that had to be dealt with. In total, the work on the 19 subway stations will cost $850 million. The remaining $86 million will be used for subway accessibility projects. The 13 stations without funding will be pushed back to the 2020‚Äì2024 Capital Plan. Other components Minor component work, such as station signage, tiling, and lighting, would also be performed at over 170 other stations as part of the plan. The MTA would also begin designing OMNY, a new contactless fare payment system to replace the MetroCard (see ). In addition, at least 1,025 R211 subway cars are expected to be ordered under the plan. The R211s would include wide doors, wider than the current MTA standard of , thereby projected to reduce station dwell time by 32%. The new cars will have Wi-Fi installed (see ), USB chargers, digital advertisements, digital customer information displays, illuminated door opening alerts, and security cameras, unlike the current New Technology Trains, which lack these features. Some lines, like the IND Eighth Avenue Line, would get communications-based train control as part of a larger plan to automate the system. These measures are all projected to help reduce overcrowding on the subway, which is prevalent. Train arrival countdown clocks  Mainline A Division and Canarsie Line clocks  In 2003, the MTA signed a $160 million contract with Siemens Transportation Systems to install digital real-time message boards (officially Public Address Customer Information Screens, or PA/CIS) at 158 of its IRT stations to display the number of minutes until the arrival of the next trains. Payments to the company were stopped in May 2006 following many technical problems and delays and MTA started to look for alternative suppliers and technologies. In January 2007 Siemens announced that the issues had been resolved and that screens would start appearing at 158 stations by the end of the year. In 2008, the system-wide roll-out was pushed back again, to 2011, with the MTA citing technical problems. An in-house simpler system developed by MTA for the was operational by early 2009 and the first three displays of the larger Siemens system became operational at stations on the IRT Pelham Line () in the Bronx in December 2009. Siemens signs were in operation in 110 A Division stations by March 2011 MTA's YouTube website. Made February 26, 2010. Retrieved September 1, 2010. MTA's YouTube website. Retrieved October 9, 2010. and in 153 IRT mainline and 24 Canarsie Line stations by late 2011. Simpler countdown clocks, which only announce the track on which the train is arriving and the number of stops the train is from the station, are used at 40 stations. This includes 13 stations on the IND Queens Boulevard Line, 19 stations on the IND Eighth Avenue Line (including four that also have next-train displays that show this information), three stations on the BMT Broadway Line, and five stations on the BMT Astoria Line; however, the clocks on the Broadway and Astoria Lines are not in use . The announcements are voiced by radio traffic reporter Bernie Wagenblast and Carolyn Hopkins. In 2012, real-time station information for the \\"mainline\\" IRT, comprising all the IRT services except the 7 train, was made available to third party developers via an API, through MTA's Subway Time mobile app and as open data. In early 2014, data for the L train were also given to developers. Displays at 5 IRT Dyre Avenue Line stations were the last in the mainline A Division to be added, as a result of signal modernizations for IRT Dyre Avenue Line stations.  Mainline B Division and Flushing Line clocks  Displays at 267 B Division stations were funded as part of the 2015‚Äì2019 capital program. Upon the October 2015 approval of funding for the 2015‚Äì2019 capital program, full installation of the countdown clocks was deferred to beyond 2020, with 323 out of 472 stationsThis includes 320 out of the 469 stations (), plus three new stations on the Second Avenue Subway opened on January 1, 2017 having countdown clocks by then. This was attributed to the rate of installation of wi-fi and 3G systems in subway stations, which, among other things, makes countdown clocks viable. The B, D, and N were expected to get countdown clocks in 2016; the B and D would get the PA/CIS along their shared IND Concourse Line stations, the D along the BMT West End Line, and the N along the BMT Sea Beach Line. Meanwhile, the IRT Flushing Line () was to get the clocks in 2018, a delay from an earlier announced date of 2016. In August 2016, a 90-day testing period began for updated countdown clocks on eight BMT Broadway Line stations on the . The clocks feature new LCD screens as opposed to the old LED screens. The new countdown clocks show the date and time, current weather, next trains, advertisements, other media, and service changes, unlike the old countdown clocks, which can only show the date and time and the next train arrivals. The LCD clocks also use data from the Bluetooth receivers installed at the end of each platform in the stations, which connect with Bluetooth receivers installed on the first and last cars of every train. If the test was successful, the remaining 269 B Division stations would receive the new LCD countdown clocks. The MTA was able to speed up the test by using Bluetooth receivers and wireless data in stations. As opposed to the countdown clocks on the numbered lines, the system calculates when the trains will pull into their next stop based on when trains enter and leave the stations. The new Bluetooth clocks performed accurately 97% of the time. In November 2016, the MTA declared the Broadway Line countdown clock test successful. All B Division stations would get countdown clocks by March 2018 (several years ahead of schedule), using the same Bluetooth technology as the clocks in the Broadway Line stations. The countdown clocks would use either existing and new Siemens tricolor LED displays like the ones on the A Division and across scattered parts of the B Division, or new multicolor LCD display like the ones on the Broadway Line. The R was the first mainline B Division route to receive countdown clocks along its entire length in July 2017. Under the MTA's rollout schedule released in July 2017, the countdown clocks on other routes would be enabled in stages through December 2017, including on the L train, where the existing LED clocks would be upgraded to use the new LCD displays. All of the countdown-clock data for the B Division services would also be available in the MTA's Subway Time app, in addition to the data for the A Division and L services that were already included in the app prior to the test. The countdown clocks for the rest of the B Division were to be installed as part of the Integrated Service Information and Management ‚Äì B Division (ISIM-B) project, which would upgrade signal towers and connect track circuits to a central database. The project was called the Beacon Train Arrival System, and all 268 underground stations would have it installed by the end of 2017. In each of the remaining 269 stations without countdown clocks, there would be two displays for each platform, as well as a single display installed just outside fare control. The cost would be around $31.7 million to install, plus $5 million in annual maintenance costs. Since the clocks are based on the Transit Wireless Wi-Fi, installation of each set of displays would cost $211,000 at every aboveground station (which did not have Transit Wireless ) and $54,000 at every underground station with Transit Wireless. The MTA would upgrade the aboveground stations so they could also get Wi-Fi capabilities. As the first batch of Bluetooth-enabled B Division countdown clocks was installed in September 2017, there were some passenger complaints about the location of the clocks. Although the MTA places the clocks at the middle of each platform, as well as offers train arrival data on its Subway Time app, riders noted that these clocks were not always placed near locations where the riders would actually wait, such as the stairs to the platforms or the station entrances. Sometimes, the clocks were hidden behind signs or located far away from the station entrances. Riders also reported instances where the clocks froze, displayed the wrong information, projected wildly fluctuating arrival times, or forgot to display upcoming trains. All of the system's stations had countdown clocks by New Year's Day 2018. The last route to get countdown clocks was the 7, which received Bluetooth-enabled clocks in December 2017 because of issues with the installation of communications-based train control on the Flushing Line.  Fare collection  RFID trial on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line Access to the paid area is by turnstile. Starting in 1992, MetroCards made by Cubic Transportation Systems replaced the subway tokens that had been used as the subway's form of fare payment from the 1950s on; by 2003, the MetroCard was the exclusive method of fare payment systemwide. Since then, there have been programs to replace the MetroCard itself. In the first program, introduced in early 2006, the MTA signed a deal with MasterCard to test out a new radio-frequency identification card payment scheme. Customers had to sign up at a special MasterCard website and use a MasterCard PayPass credit or debit card/tag to participate. Originally scheduled to end in December 2006, the trial was extended into 2007 due to \\"overwhelming positive response\\". In light of the success of the first PayPass pilot project in 2006, another trial was started by the MTA. This one started on June 1, 2010, and ended on November 30, 2010. The first two months started with the customer just using the MasterCard PayPass debit or credit card. ‚Äì MTA's YouTube website. Retrieved June 1, 2010. ‚Äì Mastercard Worldwide YouTube website. Made May 28, 2010. Retrieved June 3, 2010. However, this trial was the debut of having a rider use the VISA PayWave debit or credit card to enter the system, which started on August 1, 2010. The trial continued for six months. In 2016, the MTA announced that it would begin designing a new contactless fare payment system to replace the MetroCard. The system would probably use phone- and bank card-based payment systems like Apple Pay and Android Pay. On October 23, 2017, it was announced that the MetroCard would be phased out and replaced by OMNY, a contactless fare payment system also by Cubic, with fare payment being made using Apple Pay, Google Wallet, debit/credit cards with near-field communication enabled, or radio-frequency identification cards. The OMNY system was rolled out starting in 2019, though support of the MetroCard is slated to remain until 2023. The fare system was criticized because the new turnstiles could be hacked, thereby leaving credit card and phone information vulnerable to theft. Help Point The Help Point at the Smith‚ÄìNinth Streets station The MTA set up another technology pilot project called \\"Help Point\\" in April 2011. Help Point, a new digital-audio communications system, was designed for use in case of an emergency or to obtain subway information for travel directions. The top button is labeled red for emergencies and connects to the Rail Control Center. The bottom button is labeled green and connects to a MTA station agent for any inquiries. All units are equipped with a microphone and speaker, and can optionally be installed with a camera. Also, the test units were equipped for the hearing impaired (under ADA compliance). The two subway stations that were part of this trial were on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line. They were the 23rd Street and the Brooklyn Bridge‚ÄìCity Hall stations. The Help Points at the Brooklyn Bridge‚ÄìCity Hall station were wireless, while those at the 23rd Street station ones were hard-wired, to test which type of transmission is best for the subway. After the Help Point test was successfully completed, the MTA started to install Help Points in all subway stations to replace the existing Customer Assistance Intercom (CAI) units. The help points were installed in 166 stations by 2014, at which time the remaining stations were scheduled to have Help Points by the end of 2019. The Help Point installation timeline was later accelerated to the end of 2017. On The Go! Travel Station The On the Go! Travel Station in use at the Bowling Green station On September 19, 2011, the MTA set up another pilot project, an online, interactive touchscreen computer program called \\"On The Go! Travel Station\\" (OTG). It lists any planned work or service changes occurring on the subway as well as information to help travelers find landmarks or locales near the stations with an OTG outlet, with advertisements as well. The first station to test this new technology was Bowling Green on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line. Other stations scheduled to participate in this program were Penn Station (with the LIRR), Grand Central Terminal (with Metro- North), Atlantic Avenue‚ÄìBarclays Center in Brooklyn, and Jackson Heights‚ÄìRoosevelt Avenue/74th Street‚ÄìBroadway in Queens. New and existing On the Go! kiosks were to receive an interface overhaul as a result of the MTA's partnership with Control Group, a technology and design consultancy firm. Control Group were adding route lookups, countdown to train arrivals, and service alerts. Between 47 and 90 interactive wayfinding kiosks were scheduled to be deployed in 2013. , there are 155 kiosks at 31 stations. At the completion of Phase 2, there will be a total of 380 kiosks installed. Cellular phone and wireless data An indoor antenna, part of the alt=An indoor antenna, part of the distributed antenna system installed inside a station by Transit Wireless In 2005, Transit Wireless, a BAI Communications majority-owned company, was formed in order to compete for the MTA's request for proposals for a wireless network in the subway system. The MTA ultimately awarded the contract for building and operating the network to Transit Wireless. The New York City Subway began to provide underground cellular phone with voice and data service, and free Wi-Fi to passengers in 2011 at six stations in Chelsea, Manhattan. The new network was installed and owned by Transit Wireless as part of the company's $200 million investment. The company expanded the services to 30 more stations in 2013 and signed an agreement with all 4 major wireless network operators (Verizon Wireless, AT&T;, Sprint, and T-Mobile) to allow their cellular phone customers to use its network. The MTA and Transit Wireless are splitting the fees received from those wireless carriers for the usage of the network. The Wi-Fi service, which operates using antennae, is operated by Boingo Wireless. Poster announcing free Wi-FI Transit Wireless expected to provide service to the remaining 241 underground stations by 2017. The next 40 key stations (11 in midtown Manhattan and 29 in Queens) have antennas that were in service by March 2014. The wireless for these 40 underground stations were completed by October 2014. Phase 3 of the project was completed in March 2015 and added service to the Flushing‚ÄìMain Street station in Queens, as well as stations in Lower Manhattan, West Harlem, and Washington Heights. Phase 4 of the project covered 20 underground stations in the Bronx and seventeen in Upper Manhattan; this phase, completed in November 2015, provided service to major stations such as Lexington Avenue‚Äì53rd Street, Lexington Avenue‚Äì59th Street, 149th Street‚ÄìGrand Concourse, and 125th Street. Because Governor Andrew Cuomo had implemented a timeline for accelerated implementation of in-station wireless service, phases 6 and 7 of the Transit Wireless network build-out will connect the 90 remaining Brooklyn and Manhattan underground stations by early 2017, about one year ahead of the original completion date of 2018. In late December 2016, it was expected that all stations would have wireless by the final day of that year. However, Governor Cuomo later announced that by January 9, 2017, cellular connectivity and wireless service would be available in all underground stations, except at four stations. (, this is not yet the case.) These stations were the New South Ferry station and the three stations on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line‚ÄìProspect Avenue, 53rd Street, and Bay Ridge Avenue‚Äîthat would have wireless installed as part of their Enhanced Station renovations. Cellular connectivity was completed one year early. The entire project was completed for $300 million, with Transit Wireless sharing revenues derived from the network's service with the MTA. The partnership between Transit Wireless and the MTA is for 27 years. Wi-Fi and cellular service are currently available in all underground stations except Pelham Parkway on the Dyre Avenue line. In June 2016, the MTA began installing Wi-Fi in subway cars as well. Wireless service was installed on four R160 subway cars assigned to the Jamaica Yard, then tested along the all- underground E route; in-car Wi-Fi was expanded to 20 R160s on the E route by September. However, this pilot program was not advertised to passengers. In addition, the wireless service was not working all the time; one passenger described the signal on board the trains as spotty, and only really available on the platforms. At the time, the MTA was not planning to retrofit subway tunnels with wireless service. Still, this in-car Wi-Fi pilot program is part of the wider program to install Wi-Fi in underground stations and onboard newer MTA buses. Future subway cars, like the R211, will also include Wi-Fi upon their delivery. *For renderings, see: In 2017, the MTA partnered with NYC Public Libraries, New York State, and Transit Wireless, to create Subway Library, a system that allows users to choose from a selection of e-books to read for free when connected to TransitWireless Wi-Fi. Despite the rollout of Wi-Fi at all underground stations, wireless and cellular data are not available in the tunnels between the stations. In early 2018, the MTA started testing out Wi-Fi in the 42nd Street Shuttle tunnels.  Digital screens  One of the information and advertising screens seen at 34th Street‚ÄìHudson Yards station. The first major wave of digital advertisements in the subway were introduced with the deployment of the On the Go! Travel Station in 2011. From 2016 on, the LCD countdown clocks also provided another way to show advertisements to passengers. In September 2017, the MTA announced plans to add 31,000 digital advertising screens in 5,134 cars, as well as 9,500 extra screens in stations, far more than what the clocks or travel stations could provide. The advertising screens are being installed by Outfront Media from 2019 to 2022. There would eventually be 50,000 screens systemwide; the screens would also show service information. Prior to the announcement, most of the few digital advertising displays in use systemwide had been used to advertise the Second Avenue Subway's opening earlier that year. In 2020, the MTA started displaying real-time service metrics on the screens, such as service changes and dynamic transfer information. By then, the subway system had 5,000 such screens, with another 9,000 to be installed by September 2021 at a cost of $100 million.

The border stretches , from the tripoint with India in the north, to the Bay of Bengal in the south. About of the border is fenced, with the government of Myanmar announcing in 2017 that it was planning to fence off the rest of the border. Description The border starts in the north at the tripoint with Mizoram, India. It then proceeds southwards overland, before turning west at a point west of Paletwa. The border then proceeds to the west, north-west and then south in a broad arc before reaching the Naf River. The border then follows this wide river southwards out to the Bay of Bengal. History Historically the border region has been a contested area located at the edge of the various Indian and Burmese empires. Britain had begun conquering India (including modern Banglades) in the 17th century, and gradually took control of most of the country, forming British India. From the 1820s-80s Britain also gradually conquered Burma; by the Treaty of Yandabo in 1826 which ended the First Anglo- Burmese War Burma recognised British control over Assam, Manipur, Rakhine (Arakan), and the Taninthayi coast, thereby delimiting much of the Indo- Burmese modern boundary in general terms. Large swathes of Burma were annexed following the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852‚Äì53. The remainder of Burma was conquered in 1885 and incorporated into British India. Further Indo-Burmese boundary modifications were made in 1894, 1896, 1901, 1921 and 1922. Bangladesh & Myanmar border near BGB jetty ghat, Teknaf In 1937 Burma was split off from India and became a separate colony.Sword For Pen, TIME Magazine, 12 April 1937 In 1947 India gained independence, however the country was split into two states (India and Pakistan), with the southernmost section of the Burma-India border becoming that between Burma and East Pakistan (modern Bangladesh). Burma gained independence in 1948. In 1971 Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan after a war and thereby inherited the border with Burma/Myanmar.Historical Dictionary of Bangladesh, Page 289 Since then the boundary area has often been unstable owing to armed conflicts such as the Chittagong Hill Tracts conflict (1977-1997) in south-east Bangladesh and the Rohingya conflict in Myanmar's Rakhine state. The latter has been ongoing for decades, yet has reached a particular intensity since 2016. The latest round of fighting has resulted in Rohingya refugees crossing the border from Myanmar into Bangladesh. Bangladesh and Myanmar have agreed to close their borders during sudden influxes of Rohingya refugees. On Myanmar's side of the border in Maungdaw District, 80 percent of the population is Rohingya. In 2014 members of the Myanmar Border Police opened fire on a Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) patrol, killing one. In 2015 an armed clash occurred on the border between the Rohingya Arakan Army and the BGB. There have also been a number of incidents down the years involving fishermen on the Naf river allegedly illegally crossing the boundary.

History In 1933 the Starachowice Works received an official order to build prototypes for a 75 mm anti-aircraft gun. The design was completed in 1933 by the engineer Maj. Szyma≈Ñski from the Institute of Technology and Armaments. Who was assisted by Ing. Waclaw Stetkiewicz and M. Eng. Leszek Kistelski from the Starachowice Works. The first prototypes were completed and sent for testing in 1935. The report from the testing indicated minor deficiencies in the gun carriage, which it believed could be successfully resolved. However, it wasn't until 1937 that those defects were resolved and the wz.36 went into production. Two variants were proposed, the wz.36 which was mobile anti-aircraft gun mounted on a four-wheeled dual-axle carriage with cruciform outriggers towed by a C4P half-track and the wz.37 a statically emplaced anti-aircraft gun. The Polish Army planned to acquire 60 mobile batteries of 3 guns (180) and 70 static batteries of 4 wz.37 guns (280) for the defense of high value targets. However, by the outbreak of war in 1939, only 52 of the 460 ordered had been built. It is unknown how many wz.36/37 guns were captured by the Germans or what use of they made of them during World War II? However, it is estimated that the Russians captured forty-nine 75 mm anti-aircraft guns of all types (75 mm armata przeciwlotnicza wz.1897/14/17, 75 mm armata przeciwlotnicza wz.1922/1924 and 75 mm armata przeciwlotnicza wz.36) during the Polish Campaign.

White, was a Hopi educator, writer, and potter. Biography Born to parents Fred (of the Kachina Clan) and Sevenka (of the Coyote Clan), Polingaysi Q√∂yawayma grew up in Oraibi, a village on Arizona's Hopi Reservation. Her given name means \\"butterfly sitting among the flowers in the breeze\\". Q√∂yawayma's father worked for Mennonite missionary Henry Voth, who built a school in Oraibi and attempted to win converts to Christianity. Many in the village saw Voth's efforts to enforce attendance as heavy-handed, and this caused a rift between Hopis who opposed and supported the school. In 1906, Q√∂yawayma joined a group of students traveling to study at the Sherman Institute in Riverside, California. In her four years at the school, she lived with a teacher's family, learning English and converting to Christianity. After returning home to Oraibi, she had difficulty readjusting to traditional Hopi life. Villagers saw her as having adopted white people's ways, and were unreceptive to her Christian teachings. She left to live with a Mennonite family in Newton, Kansas, and to receive missionary training at Bethel College. In 1919 she worked as a substitute teacher in Tuba City and attended the Los Angeles Bible Institute. She had second thoughts about missionary life, however, when she continued to be unsuccessful in converting any Oraibi residents, while attempting \\"to blend the best of Hopi tradition with the best of the white culture, retaining the essence of good, whatever the source.\\" c. 1914 Teaching career In 1924 Q√∂yawayma began working at the Indian school in Hotevilla, first as a housekeeper and later as a teacher. Unusually for the time, she taught bilingually, introducing subjects to students in their native Hopi and then transitioning to English. This caused friction with her fellow teachers, and with parents who preferred that their children be taught white language and customs exclusively, in order to be more successful in American society. She persisted, believing that Native American students were more receptive to concepts which were related in terms of traditional stories and legends. She became a government employee after passing the Indian Service test in 1925, and continued to teach in Hopi and Navajo schools until 1954. She later articulated her teaching philosophy: Her methods eventually met with acceptance and acclaim. In 1941, the Bureau of Indian Affairs chose Q√∂yawayma to demonstrate bilingual teaching to school officials across the country. In 1974, Q√∂yawayma helped create a scholarship fund for Hopi students at Northern Arizona University. This was later renamed the Elizabeth White Hopi Scholarship in her honor. Writing In 1941, Polingaysi Q√∂yawayma wrote the novel The Sun Girl: A True Story about Dawamana, about difficult decisions faced by a young Hopi girl. Her autobiography No Turning Back, which she related to author Vada F. Carlson, was published in 1964. Literary critic Robert Kirsch praised it as \\"one of the rare and important documents of the Indian experience. It belongs alongside Theodora Kroeber's Ishi as an account of the collision of two cultures.\\" She also co-wrote Broken Pattern: Sunlight & Shadows of Hopi History with Carlson in 1985. Pottery After her retirement from teaching, Q√∂yawayma dedicated herself to music and art, particularly pottery. She created a unique style, using pink clay with raised symbols such as corn and Kokopelli figures. The Heard Museum in Phoenix held an exhibition of her work in the late 1970s, and some of her pots are included in its permanent collection. She frequently hosted anthropology students at her home, as well as writers such as Ernest Hemingway. Personal life Q√∂yawayma married Lloyd White, a part-Cherokee man, in 1931. They divorced one or two years later. Her nephew Al Q√∂yawayma is a successful potter and sculptor. Polingaysi Q√∂yawayma remained healthy into her eighties, but suffered a stroke in 1981. She died in a Phoenix nursing home in 1990, at age 98.

During the sea trials she reached a top speed of , the fastest ship in her class. As the destroyer was the next-to-last of her class to enter service, she had already received the modifications that her sisterships needed after completion in order to improve stability and seaworthiness.http://conlapelleappesaaunchiodo.blogspot.it/2015/05/alvise-da- mosto.html During the 1930s, Da Mosto operated with the Italian fleet for most of the time, taking part in naval exercises. She also sailed to South America for an official visit together with sister ship Emanuele Pessagno. Between 1936 and 1937 she participated in Italian naval operations linked to the Spanish Civil War, escorting ships that carried troops and supplies for Francisco Franco's forces from Italy to Spain. Originally classified as an esploratore (flotilla leader/scout cruiser), Da Mosto was re-rated as a destroyer in 1938.  World War II  When Italy entered World War II, on 10 June 1940, Da Mosto was undergoing modification work to her bow in the La Spezia Naval Arsenal, and she only re-entered service in August 1940, assigned to the 15th Destroyer Division with sisterships Antonio Pigafetta, Giovanni Da Verrazzano, Lanzerotto Malocello and Nicol√≤ Zeno.

On 1 December, just before sunset, Mantovani was crippled by Bristol Blenheim bombers of the Royal Air Force; Da Mosto tried to take her in tow, but another air strike set the tanker on fire, and she had to be abandoned by her crew. Shortly thereafter, Da Mosto was attacked by the British Force K, consisting of the cruisers Aurora and Penelope and the destroyer Lively. Da Mosto engaged the British ships in a last attempt to save as many survivors as possible from the sinking tanker, but was hit multiple times, including in one of her magazines, and quickly sank at 18:15 in 33¬∞53' N, 12¬∞28' E, about 75 miles northwest of Tripoli.

She was noted as a telegraphist who assisted the guerrilla forces during the United States occupation of Nicaragua and who negotiated with President Juan Bautista Sacasa to gain amnesty for the rebels and negotiate peace at the end of the conflict. Early life Blanca Stella Ar√°uz Pineda was born on 25 May 1909 in the town of San Rafael del Norte in Las Segovias region (now in the Jinotega Department), of Nicaragua to Esther Pineda Rivera and Pablo Jes√∫s Ar√°uz Rivera. She was the youngest of eleven children, all of whom learned Morse code from a young age. Her mother was a tailor and dressmaker and her father managed the local telegraph office. From the age of ten, Ar√°uz had mastered telegraphy by playing in her father's office and being taught to use the equipment by her sister Lucila. Career In 1927, when the guerrilla leader, Augusto C√©sar Sandino came to San Rafael del Norte, during the Constitutionalist War, he established his headquarters in the telegraph office, which was directly across the street from the American marine's headquarters. Because of the location, Ar√°uz was able to monitor the American forces' movements and advise Sandino. She was also known to intercept messages and send misinformation, becoming a valuable link in the intelligence service for the Army in Defense of the National Sovereignty of Nicaragua (). The two spent long hours collaborating on a plan to capture the city of Jinotega and simultaneously send forces to assist General Jos√© Mar√≠a Moncada. Working closely together, Ar√°uz and Sandino fell in love and were married in a religious ceremony on 19 May 1927. Within two days, Sandino returned to the front and Ar√°uz returned to her work in the telegraph office tracking the enemy troops and the nationals who collaborated with them. Periodically, she would live with Sandino in the camps, though travel was difficult. Ar√°uz became a target of both the D√≠az administration's National Guard and the United States Marine Corps. On 2 March 1929, Ar√°uz was arrested, as it was suspected that she had been sending messages to her husband. She was taken to Managua, where she was imprisoned for seven months. The following year, she was arrested again and sent with her mother and sister to Prison 21 in Le√≥n. In this notorious prison, she was tortured in an attempt to force her to reveal Sandino's whereabouts. Pressure from family friends and the local bishop secured her removal to La Recolecci√≥n Monastery. While there, she learned typing and practiced her needlework. Sandino threatened the National Guard with reprisals if his family was not released and after six months, she was allowed to return home. From 1930, Sandino became involved in an anti- clerical battle with the local priests in Las Segovias, haranguing them for urging the local inhabitants to avoid the fighting and accept the governance of the U.S. forces. In 1931 Ar√°uz joined Sandino in his camp headquarters, though the most fierce campaigns were fought in Las Segovias. She soon became pregnant, though she miscarried a child in 1931 and another in 1932. During her time in the camps, she wrote the poem Para mi viejito querid√≠simo Augusto C√©sar Sandino (For my dear old Augusto C√©sar Sandino) in 1932. Later that same year, Juan Bautista Sacasa won the presidential election. The United States forces were preparing to leave Nicaragua, and Sandino appointed Ar√°uz to go to Managua to initiate his terms of surrender. Though she was four months pregnant, Ar√°uz left in December 1932 to meet with the delegation in San Rafael del Norte. She fell from her mule during the trip, but managed to arrive on 4 January 1933 and convince the officers that she had a safe conduct pass from Sacasa to continue her journey. Leading a peace commission, including Gregorio Sandino, Sofon√≠as Salvatierra, and Am√©rica Tiffer de Sandino, they arrived in Managua on 6 January 1933. Ar√°uz advised Sacasa that Sandino was willing to negotiate with his new government and lay down his arms. The couple decided to have a civil ceremony to legitimize their marriage and were married in San Rafael del Norte by the local judge on 27 May 1933. Almost immediately after the ceremony, Sandino left for Managua to finalize the terms of the peace treaty. Death and legacy Ar√°uz died in the childbirth of her only surviving daughter, Blanca Segovia Sandino Ar√°uz, on 2 June 1933. After her death, Ar√°uz was memorialized by Luis Enrique Mej√≠a Godoy in two songs All√° va el general (There goes the general) and Carta de amor a Blanquita (Love letter to Blanquita). In 2012, she was posthumously awarded the Honorary Medal for Meritorious Soldiers of the Fatherland. In 2015, she was decreed by a statute, as the first National Heroine of Nicaragua.

Lai Ning's actions were deemed heroic by the Chinese government and Lai has been celebrated as a hero and martyr in contemporary China. Personal life and death Lai Ning was a fourteen-year- old schoolboy living in Shimian County where he was regarded as a loner by his classmates, and, for reporting their infractions, a \\"snitch.\\" On March 13, 1988, a wildfire was threatening a nearby forest and schoolchildren were mobilized to help fight the fire. Lai voluntarily assisted the firefighting efforts for five hours. Lai was eventually overcome by the flames and killed in the fire. Legacy Lai Ning was later declared a \\"revolutionary martyr\\" by the Chinese government for his role in combating the wildfire to protect his town. Over the next year, his story was used increasingly in Chinese propaganda as a model of courage and duty for Chinese youth. This was especially important in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests when the Chinese government hoped to gain support from Chinese teenagers and promote an alternative example of youth in China. Deng Yingchao declared that \\"only by plunging into studies of Lai Ning can you become the sound new masters of your country in the 21st century\\" in the People's Daily. Since that time, Lai Ning has been commemorated with posters in school classrooms and statues in town squares. In the 1990s, Lai's story was taught in Chinese textbooks to teach students about the importance of protecting Chinese society. The propaganda surrounding Lai Ning was sometimes poorly received within China, and some teachers believed that the calls for emulation were outdated tactics from the Cultural Revolution era. A miniseries depicting Lai Ning's life was aired in the years following his death and a film was released in 1993.

While the date of his first consulship is not certain, the name of his colleague for that term, Publius Fabius Firmanus, is.Giuseppe Camodeca, \\"Novit√† sui fasti consolari delle tavolette cerate della Campania\\", Publications de l'√âcole fran√ßaise de Rome, 143 (1991), pp. 52, 70 His second consulship, with Marcus Pompeius Silvanus Staberius Flavianus as his colleague, was for the third nundinium of the year 76.Paul Gallivan, \\"The Fasti for the Reign of Claudius\\", Classical Quarterly, 28 (1978), pp. 408, 424  Life  Flavianus' career is not yet known prior to his first consulship. An inscription from Fundi records that following that office he was proconsular governor of an unknown province, then governor of Pannonia. Pliny the Elder tells us the public province was Africa.Pliny, Natural History, II.96 As for the date of his governorship, while Ronald Syme attempted to show it was in the years 70/71, R.D. Milns notes \\"most scholars are in agreement that a Neronian dating is more likely.\\"Milns, \\"The Career of M. Aponius Saturninus\\", Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte, 22 (1973), p. 285 From the history of the Year of the Four Emperors, it is clear that he was governor of Pannonia in the year 69.Tacitus, Histories, II.86; III.4,10 He was likely governor in the previous year, 68--both Tacitus and the inscription from Fundi mention that Flavianus achieved a military victory, likely beyond the middle Danube, for which he later received triumphal ornaments.Tacitus, Histories, V.26 His actions in the chaotic year of 69 are the best-known portion of his life. Here Tacitus describes him as \\"rich and advanced in year[s]\\", and was influenced by the provincial procurator, Cornelius Fuscus,Tacitus, Histories, II.86 implying that Flavianus was unqualified to be governor of the province. This is an odd charge to make, considering Flavianus' victory beyond the Rhine the previous year. Flavianus was called to Rome early that year; the records of the Arval Brethren note he was admitted to their order on 26 February 69. Milns suggests this was done at Otho's direction, for \\"Otho needed every friend he could obtain\\", although he admits that the Arval Brethren \\"was not regarded as one of the more prestigious priestly colleges\\". Upon returning to Pannonia, he found the soldiers of his province suspicious of him, in part from his journey to Rome, in part because of his caution in picking a side in the ongoing civil war. Later that year, when the legions of Pannonia declared for Vespasian and marched forth to battle the soldiers who had sided with Vitellius, shortly after reaching northern Italy and having taken positions before the city of Verona, they turned on Flavianus and attempted to murder him. First Marcus Aponius Saturninus tried to reason with the troops to save Flavianus, and when he failed general Marcus Antonius Primus intervened to protect Flavianus. When speeches failed to quiet the men, Antonius resorted to trickery and ordered Flavianus loaded with chains and imprisoned. However, the men saw through this deception and attempted to overrun the tribunal whence Antonius spoke. Antonius then stood before them with drawn sword, announcing they would need to kill him before they would lay hands on Flavianus. At this point the mutiny abated, and under the cover of darkness Flavianus was able to flee the camp. As he proceeded forth, Tacitus tells us he was met by a messenger bearing orders relieving him of his command.Tacitus, Histories, III.10 Although Flavianus sat out the rest of the civil war, he was treated honorably by Vespasian, who awarded him the triumphal ornaments mentioned above. He was appointed curator aquarum, or overseer of the aqueducts of Rome from 73 to 74.Frontinus, De Aquis, 102 This was followed a few years later with a second consulate. His life, after this point, is unknown, as is the date of his death.

His career is marked by the Reformation and Counter-Reformation struggles of his time. A noted composer in his day, Daser has been largely overshadowed by Orlande de Lassus, who replaced him in Munich.  Biography  Daser was born in Munich near the year 1526, the son of fisherman Achacius Daser. At an early age he joined the Bavarian Hofkapelle in Munich. There he received formal education in theology and music, the latter as a pupil of Ludwig Senfl. An ordained priest, he entered the Bayerische Hofkapelle in 1550 alongside Mattheus Le Maistre. He became the Munich court choirmaster in 1552, replacing Andreas Zauner. Daser earned extra money as a music copyist while he held the Kapellmeister position. In addition to conducting and composing, Daser was responsible for training boys for the choir, and for hiring vocal and instrumental musicians for the chapel. His position afforded him a salary, food and clothing allowances, and monetary bonuses on various occasions, not limited to the New Year. Le Maistre's sudden departure from Munich in 1554 caused Daser to also assume duties as court composer. Although the court of Albert V, Duke of Bavaria was decidedly Catholic, Daser's predilection towards protestantism was stated in his Missa Ave Marie, where in the Credo section he added a word to the confession of faith \\"Et in unum Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum\\", at the time a clear signal of intent. In 1556 Orlande de Lassus arrived at the Munich court. The universal acclaim accorded to de Lassus caused discomfiture for Daser, as his role as primary musician became supplanted by de Lassus. In the 1560s, Albert V began actively pursuing a course of establishing Catholicism at his court. There is some controversy surrounding Daser's activities between 1563 and 1572. Daser was subject to an Inquisition, and was shortly removed from his position of Kapellmeister in 1563 on grounds of \\"ill health\\". Iain Fenlon suggests that he was found to be \\"Lutheran\\", and that the \\"ill health\\" was a pretext upon which allowed the Duke to give Daser a retirement pension of considerate amount. Bernhold Schmid posits that Daser really did suffer from poor health for a period of time. In any case, he was replaced by Orlande de Lassus. Nevertheless, Daser's music continued to be performed at the Munich chapel under de Lassus. Daser moved to Stuttgart in 1572 and became kapellmeister there, openly converting as he found no resistance to his Lutheranism from the Duke of W√ºrttemberg. Daser's \\"retirement\\" pension from Bavaria was thus revoked. He remained Kapellmeister at Stuttgart for seventeen years. He died in Stuttgart on 27 March 1589. His son-in-law Balduin Hoyoul succeeded him as Kapellmeister in Stuttgart.  Influences, style, and impact  Daser's compositional output consisted mainly of masses, of which 22 manuscripts are extant. He also wrote motets. His works continued to be performed in a court context as last as 1616. Daser was significantly influenced by the Franco-Flemish School, demonstrated by his methodology for tying the cantus firmus to the Ordinary. The sources of his melodies often originate from the Netherlands. He employed a variety of methods of treating plainchant melody within his masses, including canon, ornamentation, cantus firmus, and juxtaposition. Daser would move the cantus firmus from the tenor to the highest voicing, in order to highlight the main melody. Daser was highly respected by his contemporaries, receiving high commendation from Bavarian court chronicler Massimo Troiano. Much of his work is held in manuscript form at the Bavarian State Library. His works are ambitious in nature, notable for their complexity. His contemporaries particularly valued his lyrical abilities. His style was conservative in nature for his time, evidenced by his four-voice masses and his reliance on the cantus firmus technique. However, his style became more \\"modern\\" during his time at Stuttgart. Orlande de Lassus' mass number 40 Ecce nunc benedicite was directly modeled on a work by Daser.  Works   Masses  = 4 voices = *Ave Maria *De virginibus *Dominicalis (i) *Dominicalis (ii) *Ecce nunc benedicite *Grace et vertu (attributed) *Mins liefkins braun augen *Paschalis *Per signum crucis (attributed) *Qui habitat *Un gay bergier = 5 voices = *Beati omnes *Dixerunt discipuli *Ferialis *Fors seulement *Jerusalem surge *In feriis quadragesimae *Inviolata *Maria Magdalena *Pater noster *Sexti modi = 6 voices = *Praeter rerum seriem  Mass Propers  *De Sancto Spiritu infra septuagesima (4 voices) *De veneratione (4 voices) In addition to the masses, he composed a work for four voices entitled Patrocinium musices; passionis Domini nostri Jesus Christi historia, a Magnificat for four voices, a Magnificat for eight voices, 24 motets for four to eight voices, and 34 hymns and psalms in German.

He was a leader of the concrete art movement in Brazil, co-founding Grupo Ruptura and was known for his trailblazing work in experimental abstract photography and modernism. According to The Guardian, De Barros was \\"one of the most influential Brazilian artists of the 20th century.\\"  Early life and education  De Barros was born in the city Chavantes, in the state of S√£o Paulo in Brazil. When he was 16 years old, De Barros began taking pictures using a homemade camera that he built himself. At the time he was interested in experimenting with scratching and manipulating the negatives and images. From 1945 to 1947, De Barros studied drawing and painting with Cl√≥vis Graciano, Collete Pujol, and Yoshioka Takaoka, with a focus on figurative and landscape painting. He moved into the world of abstraction and studied European abstract constructivism and art of the 1920s and 1930s. He was particularly influenced by Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg and the De Stijl movement. In 1946, De Barros began studying painting at the Associa√ßi√£o Paulista de Belas Artes.  Career  For many years De Barros supported himself by working at Banco do Brasil. In 1946 and 1947, De Barros began to explore photography. In 1948, he co-founded Grupo XV, which was a collective of mostly Japanese painters interested in exploring post-impressionist art. In 1948, De Barros was introduced to the concepts of Gestalt theory, where he focused heavily on form, by the critic M√°rio Pedrosa. He was also influenced at the time by Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, and the Bauhaus movement in relation to industrial design. In 1949, he started a photography lab with his friend Atha√≠de de Barros and Thomaz Farkas, and, with the intention of deepening his knowledge, he joined the Foto Cine Clube Bandeirante in S√£o Paulo, a group of artists who focused on pictorialism. Artists in this group included German Lorca, Jos√© Yalenti, Thomaz Farkas, among others. During this time, De Barros studied photographic experimental practices from Europe and United States in the work of Moholy-Nagy and Man Ray. In 1949, De Barros began teaching and organized the photography laboratory of the S√£o Paulo Museum of Art (MASP). In 1950, De Barros held Fotoformas at the Museu de Arte de S√£o Paulo, an exhibition which represented a new era in the process of photography in Brazil. The title was influenced by Gestalt theory. In 1951, received a scholarship from the French government, and taking a one-year leave from his job at Banco do Brasil, he went to Paris to study lithography at the National Superior School of Fine Arts and engraving at Stanley William Hayter's atelier. He went on to attend the Ulm School of Design in Ulm, Germany, where he studied graphic arts with Otl Aicher and met Max Bill. At this point he abandoned his work in photography to focus on concrete art. In 1952, De Barros co-founded Grupo Ruptura with Judith Lauand, Luiz Sacilotto, Lothar Charoux, Waldemar Cordeiro, among others. He was involved in writing the manifesto that outlined abstract and concrete art. De Barros founded the photography group called Escola Paulista. In 1954, De Barros founded with Frei Jo√£o Batista a cooperative furniture design company called Unilabor, which was successful and allowed him to leave his job at Banco do Brasil. In 1964, De Barros went on to found in association with Alo√≠sio Bione another furniture design company called Hobjeto. Both Unilabor and Hobjeto went bankrupt due to the political instability and economic hardship of the time. In the 1960s, De Barros worked with Nelson Leirner, putting on pop art events, often including outdoor advertisements that had been removed, re-worked, and replaced in the street. In 1966, De Barros, founded Galeria Rex with Carlos Fajardo, Frederico Nasser, Jos√© Rezende Filho, Nelson Leiner, and Wesley Duke Lee as an experiment in the art market and selling art. Although the gallery closed after a year, the Grupo Rex and the work of the group continued for over 12 years. In 1977, De Barros returned to geometric art and concepts of concrete art, using Formica as his base material in further exploring industrial design. Geraldo abandoned photography for over 30 years, devoting himself to focus on arts and design. In 1996, his daughter put together an exhibit of photographs from his archive that was held at Mus√©e de l'Elys√©e in Lausanne, Switzerland, which led to an interest in De Barros' early work in photography. In 1996, after suffering several brain ischemia and with his motor functions totally debilitated, he resumed working in photography, and with the help of his assistant, the photographer Ana Moraes, made a last series of 250 works called \\"Sobras.\\" It wasn't until 1998 that De Barros' work was exhibited in the United States, at Sicardi-Sanders Gallery in Houston, Texas.  Death  De Barros died on April 17, 1998, in S√£o Paulo at the age of 75.  Legacy  Following his death, the legacy of De Barros' work led to an increased coverage and academic and art history-based awareness of his importance and impact as a central figure in Brazil's recent art history. Retrospectives were held in Europe and North America.  Documentary  In 1999, a documentary on De Barros directed by Michel Favre called Geraldo de Barros: Sobras em Obras was released. The film was produced by De Barros' daughter, Fabiana de Barros.

Frings was born on February 27, 1925 in Cologne-Lindenthal, Germany. He attended a Catholic school, and lived near a Jewish community. His home and school were destroyed in the bombing of Cologne in World War II. Later in the war, Frings was drafted into the German Army. He was captured by American forces and held at a prisoner-of-war camp near Rouen, France. After the war, Frings studied Philosophy, English, and French at University of Cologne; he received his doctorate in philosophy in 1953. In 1958, Frings immigrated to the United States to teach philosophy at the University of Detroit. In 1962, Frings accepted a position teaching at Duquesne University.

The novel was released in English in hardback, e-book, and audiobook on February 25, 2014 through Gallery Books. The following year, it won the inaugural James Herbert Award for Horror Writing. The novel follows a troop of Boy Scouts who must deal with not only the threats posed by killer tapeworms, but also the homicidal and sociopathic tendencies of one of their own. Synopsis The Troop follows the story of five teenage boys and their Scoutmaster as they spend a weekend away on Falstaff Island, a remote island a short distance away from the town where they all live. The troop consists of Scoutmaster Tim Riggs (a middle aged man and the town physician), Max (a mild mannered boy and best friend of Ephraim), Ephraim (nicknamed Eef, a boy prone to violent outbursts, best friend of Max), Newt, a quiet, 'nerdy' boy who is quite intelligent), Kent (a bold and tenacious boy prone to forcing his leadership among others), and Shelley (a deeply disturbed boy with psychopathic tendencies). Determined to simulate a true-to-life remote island scenario, Tim makes sure to remove any form of communication to the mainland. However, he does bring along a radio because there had been warnings of a potential storm. On the first evening of the trip, Tim notices a boat arriving on the island. Not expecting visitors for another two days, Riggs is wary of the stranger, who, upon inspection, is inhumanly malnourished but otherwise non-threatening. The stranger tells Tim that he needs help and is ravenously hungry. After deliberating, Tim allows the man to rest on the couch inside for the night, but not before telling the boys to stay in their room. Tim notes that the state of the stranger is almost impossible, and requires heavy medical intervention to fix. Tim attempts to hail help on the radio when he is set upon by the stranger, who, in his flailing, manages to break the radio and vomit some kind of sludge onto Tim. Tim manages to push the man back onto a sofa, remarking that he felt a \\"squirm\\" from within the man's belly. The man falls unconscious from the scuffle. Tim explains to the boys everything is okay, before falling asleep watching the man. The next day, Scoutmaster Riggs sends the boys off on a hike so that he can sort out a solution, remarking that he's starting to feel hungry. He makes his way to the beach to find that the stranger had arrived on a motorboat, but that the spark plugs needed to operate the boat were missing. On the hike, Kent forces his way into the lead and gets the troop lost. They eventually make their way to a clearing where they suddenly see a black military helicopter above them, which circles the island before returning to the mainland. When they get back to the cabin, they see the Scoutmaster, who mentions that he's lost at least 25 pounds since the previous evening. Sitting around the campfire and in a state of delirium, Scoutmaster Tim asks one of the boys to assist in performing a surgery on the man, rationalising that it's the only way to help him. He asks Max, (specifically, since the boy's father is the local mortician) who reluctantly agrees to assist. Tim and Max enter the cabin while the rest of the troop wait outside. Tim crudely sets up an operating station, disinfecting poor medical equipment with whiskey, before taking a swig himself. With Max's uneasy help, Tim cuts open the strangers stomach, when a giant, white worm bursts from the open wound. The strangers eyes shoot open and he begins flailing about until the worm wraps itself around the strangers neck, killing him. When the worm begins on a path towards Tim, he cuts the worm in two, killing it. Both the Scoutmaster and Max leave the cabin. Outside, Tim explains to the rest of the troop what happened. Kent, intent on defying an adult's rule, goes to inspect the cabin, despite Tim's protest. All the boys, Tim included, follow into the cabin, witnessing the mess. With unfortunate timing, Tim displays that he himself has become infected with whatever the stranger had. Kent seizes this opportunity to wrest power from the Scoutmaster and convinces the troop to help lock him in a closet. Tim pleads that he needs help, but is too weak to fight the boys back and eventually submits. Shelley then encourages Kent to have a 'victory sip' of whiskey, the same bottle the Scoutmaster drank from earlier. They opt to sleep outside for the night and look for help the next day. When the boys wake up, they notice two things. One, their cooler of food was missing and two, Kent was looking quite gaunt and skinny. The boys fight over who moved the food, eventually all conceding that an animal may have taken it. It is revealed through a flashback that Kent had stolen the food during the night and eaten the majority of it in ravenous hunger. While out looking for more food to eat, the boys realise that the storm, previously predicted to pass them, is now on a direct heading for Falstaff Island. They rush back to the cabin and through the closet door ask Tim for help. Tim, his voice now laboured and 'weird', tells the boys to get into the cellar and asks if any of them are infected. Shelley, determined to stir strife within the troop, blurts out that Kent is sick, Kent denies this. They make way for the cellar and proceed down, but when Kent tries to walk down, Ephraim refuses him. They get into a fight, with Ephraim being the clear victor. Max and Newt refuse to leave Kent alone outside, and guide him to a nearby crook in the house to rest in and be sheltered from the storm. During the night, Kent pleads to be let into the cellar as the storm has become increasingly violent, the boys relent but tell Kent to sit in the far corner of the room. The next day Max, Ephraim and Newt check on the Scoutmaster, finding that a tree has fallen on the house and crushed the closet, killing Tim in the process. The boys hear a 'squirming' noise when white worms of varying sizes sprout from Scoutmaster Tim's body, eventually emerging as a 'ball' of worms. The boys flee. After trying to find a missing Shelley, Max, Newt and Eef go searching for food. In their absence, Shelley uses this time to torment and torture a now completely disfigured Kent. Using a walkie talkie to speak with Eef, Shelley manages to convince him that in his fight with Kent, Eef had become infected. Separated from the others, Eef begins to self-mutilate in a vain effort to remove any worms inside of him. Shelley then lures Kent into the ocean before killing him, becoming infected in the process. When the boys return to find Shelley but no Kent, Newt and Max try to find him. In their absence, Shelley convinces a now crazed (but not infected) Ephraim that being set on fire is the only way to remove the worms inside him. Shelley obliges, dousing Ephraim in gasoline and setting him alight. The boys return to find the smoldering corpse of Ephraim and Shelley missing once more, correctly assuming that Shelley is responsible for what transpired. Newt and Max opt to escape via the same way the stranger arrived, his boat. Max guesses that in his hunger, the stranger did not throw away the spark plugs, but ate them. They enter the cabin and after a gruesome search through the strangers corpse, find the spark plugs. They return to the boat and find that although the spark plugs fit and work, the boat requires gasoline to start. Once again they return to the cabin to retrieve gasoline, but find that the spark plugs are missing when they arrive back at the boat. After a short fight to relieve their frustration, Newt and Max search for Shelley, whom they correctly assume stole the plugs. Following the scent of rot, the boys find a small cave they believe to contain Shelley and hopefully the spark plugs. Inside, they find the spark plugs, but are unable to retrieve them when a hideously deformed Shelley attacks and has his stomach burst open, spreading the worms everywhere, infecting Newt. Max grabs Newt and they retreat. Later, they are both sitting at the campfire once more, unsure of what to do. Max can see that Newt is becoming worse and worse, losing weight rapidly. Max returns to the cave himself and successfully retrieves the spark plugs, noting that Shelley is now virtually a corpse. With the plugs and fuel in the boat, the boys escape the island. Shortly after, they are halted by several military ships. In a state of infected delirium, Newt stands up, saying \\"I'm so....so....\\" before being shot and killed by military personnel. Max, the only survivor of the Falstaff incident, finds he is unable to live life normally, with everyone, even his parents, treating him differently. The ending is somewhat up to interpretation, with the final passage remarking that Max is returning to the island on a stolen boat, with a deep 'hunger' inside of him. During the story, each chapter is intercut with various reports and interviews surrounding the events that transpired on the island. Over the course of the book, it is revealed that a scientist of incredible skill but little restraint (Dr. Edgerton) was working on a modified tapeworm that could rapidly but safely cause weight loss. He was also secretly accepting grants from military weaponry agencies to modify it for use in warfare. Dr Edgerton convinced a man to be part of a study, becoming injected with this worm. Through careful manipulation and planning, the patient was released into Falstaff Island, to allegedly test the virulence and military capabilities of the worm.  Release  The Troop was released in hardback through Galley Books in the United States on February 25, 2014, alongside an audiobook adaptation narrated by Corey Brill. A mass-market paperback edition by Pocket Books was released in July of that year and Gallery Books issued a larger paperback in 2016. It has since been released in French, Hungarian, and Chinese.  Film adaptation  In August 2019 Deadline reported that film rights to The Troop were optioned by James Wan‚Äôs Atomic Monster Productions. E.L. Katz has been named as director, while Wan and Michael Clear will serve as producers. Noah Gardner and Aidan Fitzgerald have been picked as the film's screenwriters. Reception The Troop has received positive reviews from outlets such as the Quill and Quire and National Post, the latter of which included a satirical review from Davidson praising the book. The book has been favorably compared to Stephen King's Carrie for its use of \\"extratextual materials, including newspaper articles, interviews and the like, to supplement the narrative\\", which Davidson has cited as an inspiration. Tor.com's Niall Alexander also compared the work to Carrie and criticized the characters as \\"broadly characterised\\" and stating that \\"This whisper is what The Troop tries and I‚Äôm afraid fails to trade in. Instead, Cutter must make do with revulsion, but it‚Äôs no substitute, ultimately. A twisted coming of age tale, more Koryta than King, which I quite liked despite its disappointing dependence on disgust.\\" Publisher's Weekly had similar criticisms, writing \\"Competent prose makes up in part for stock characters‚Äîthe nerd, the popular kid, the quiet psychotic. Cutter‚Äôs appeal to modern-day disquiet over the ethical lapses of the military-industrial complex will strike many as pro forma rather than based in any authentic outrage over abuses real or imagined.\\"  Awards  * James Herbert Award for Horror Writing (2015, won) References External links * 2010s horror novels ","title":"The Troop (book)"},{"id":"55209307","text":"Carol Jane Mavor is an American writer and professor. Her work includes the books Pleasures Taken: Performances of Sexuality and Loss in Victorian Photographs, Becoming: The Photographs of Clementina, Viscountess Hawarden, and Blue Mythologies: Reflections on a Colour. She is Professor of Art History and Visual Culture at the University of Manchester.  Writing  Mavor's first book, Pleasures Taken: Performances of Sexuality and Loss in Victorian Photographs, was published by Duke University Press in 1995. Pleasures Taken critically analyzes three Victorian era photograph collections, including photographs of young girls collected by Lewis Carroll, and argues that similarities in fantasies between Victorians and people of the present day make it difficult for current observers to see Victorian desires. While The Times Literary Supplement described her application of literary theory as \\"strained\\", it also noted that Mavor \\"intends to provoke, and she succeeds\\". Four years later Mavor's second book, Becoming: The Photographs of Clementina, Viscountess Hawarden, was published by Duke University Press. Becoming examines the photographs taken by Clementina Maude, Viscountess Hawarden of her daughters, and reads them for sensual and erotic content. Susan Freeman, writing for the Journal of Women's History, summarized the book as \\"a theoretical and provocative examination of female photographers and their subjects, mother-daughter relationships, pleasure, and same-sex sexuality\\". The Village Voice praised Mavor's \\"real flair for evoking and elucidating individual images\\" but criticized her \\"tendency to fall into erotic flights of fancy\\", ultimately concluding that \\"Mavor's analytic foibles far outweigh her strengths\\". The Times Literary Supplement also found fault with Mavor's \\"single-minded\\" interpretations, and noted that the book \\"shows no interest in how Hawarden herself might have viewed her photography\\". Mavor's 2007 book Reading Boyishly: J.M. Barrie, Roland Barthes, Jacques Henri Lartigue, Marcel Proust and D.W. Winnicott, a \\"boyish\\" exploration of the work of the authors named in the title, was described by Grayson Perry in The Guardian as a \\"thrilling mix of philosophy, photography, biography and much more\\", and by Susan Salter Reynolds in the Los Angeles Times as \\"a defense of adolescence\\". In 2012 Duke University Press published Mavor's book Black and Blue: The Bruising Passion of Camera Lucida, La Jet√©e, Sans Soleil and Hiroshima mon amour, in which Mavor uses personal recollections to interpret the French post-war works of Roland Barthes, Chris Marker, Marguerite Duras and Alain Resnais. The Los Angeles Review of Books described the book as ‚Äúa testimony to the bruising and wounding power of art‚Äù written in \\"an unabashedly first person, nonprescriptive account\\". In French Studies, Max Silverman pointed out that \\"Carol Mavor does not write conventional works of art and literary criticism\\" and that although the writing is \\"defiantly non-rational\\", its \\"poetic ‚Äòlogic‚Äô of similarities and differences and correspondences and absences open up culture and the unconscious in illuminating ways.\\" Blue Mythologies: Reflections on a Colour, which Publishers Weekly called a \\"fine, multi-disciplinary work\\" that \\"explores the color's aesthetic and emotional resonances from a fresh perspective\\", was published by Reaktion Books in 2013. Visual Studies summarized Blue Mythologies as \\"a poetic and scholarly exploration of humanity's fascination with blue, written in an unashamedly personal and structurally inventive style\\". Writing for the Los Angeles Review of Books, Dylan Montanari praised Mavor's ability \\"to coax us into having a less complacent attitude to our own contradictory investments, even when it comes to something as apparently innocuous as a color\\", but also noted that some readers might dismiss some of the book's analysis as \\"fanciful musings on Mavor's part, fit for a memoir, perhaps, but little else\\". Philip Hoare of Times Higher Education suggested that \\"it is easier to read Blue Mythologies as enhanced poetry, rather than prose\\", concluding that the book \\"succeeds in directing our eyes anew\\". Mavor's most recent book, Aurelia: Art and Literature Through the Mouth of the Fairy Tale was published by Reaktion Books in 2017. For Jack Zipes the book itself is ‚Äúan extraordinary, poetical, and analytical fairy tale‚Äù about art, literature and fairytales, which Mavor then uses to demonstrate ‚Äúhow we comprehend and metonymically live our lives through these stories‚Äù. Mavor's poem \\"Mothball Moon\\" was published in P. N. Review. She has also written essays for Cabinet Magazine.  Films  Mavor created the film Fairy Tale Still Almost Blue, which was described in The Philadelphia Inquirer as \\"something akin to an all-female, fairy-tale version of Thomas Mann's dark novella Death in Venice\\". She also wrote and performed in Full, which was filmed and edited by Megan Powell.  Academic career  Mavor is a Professor of Art History and Visual Culture at the University of Manchester, and has held temporary honorary positions at other institutions including the Northrop Frye Chair in Literary Theory at the University of Toronto in 2010 and the Novo Nordic Professor Art History and Visual Culture at the University of Copenhagen in 2019. She earned her PhD in the History of Consciousness in 1989 under the direction of Hayden White at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

It is currently in the Museum of Fine Arts Boston as part of The Ancient World Collections. The artist, Onesimos, uses red-figure technique for the decoration. Red-figure technique was invented in Athens around 530 B.C. and quickly became one of the leading modes of decoration Athenian potters used. Red-figure technique was favored because it allowed for a greater representation of garments, emotions and anatomy making it useful for artists, such as Onesimos, to use in painting athletic events.  Onesimos  Onesimos was an artist who worked in Athens from 500-480 B.C. His name means \\"profitable\\" and it is speculated that is could have been a nickname His name is known because of a cup that was found which also held the signature of the potter Euphronios. He almost exclusively painted cups and he favored realistic portrayals of the human body often painting athletic events and other activities that allowed for him to depict active poses.  Depictions  thumb220x220px Pancration Foul Scene by the Foundry Painter The exterior sides of this kylix holds depictions for two athletic events: the pancration and a wrestling match. The pancration was a popular athletic event in Ancient Greece and was introduced in 648 BCE to the Olympic Games. The word pancration can be broken down into pan meaning all and kratos meaning strength or power and it was a form of ancient martial arts that combined both wrestling and boxing. In Onesimos' depiction of the pancration there are two young boys wrestling, their youth evident from their lack of facial hair, and there are two trainers, one on either side of the them. One trainer is standing and the other is sitting next to a column that is holding what appears to be a prize cauldron. There is also another young boy standing next to the standing trainer. Scenes of the pancration were common among red-figure vessels depicting athletic events as is seen by the pancration scene by the Foundry Painter. The other athletic event depicted is boxing. There are also two young boys with no facial hair engaged in the athletic act with the one on the left facing frontally towards the viewer. They being observed by a trainer on the left with a staff and staves in his hand and another young boy on the right. The boy standing on the right observing the young boxers appears to be in a stance of measuring the field and is also a mirror image of the boy observing in the pancration scene. In the background around the scene there are different objects that would typically be used in athletic events such as a two mattocks, a discus bag which appears to be on a wall, and jumping weights. The tondo or the interior of this kylix holds an image on a youth holding a hare. His face is frontal facing the viewer and he is wearing a himation or a cloak around his shoulders and there is a walking stick in the background.  Inscriptions  On the pancration scene there is one inscription that reads \\"Panaitios kalos\\" which is translated to \\"Panaitios is handsome\\". In many of his kalos inscriptions, Onesimos uses the name Panaitios which misled many to believe that there was a Panaitios Painter whose work was earlier than Onesimos. It is now accepted, however, that the Panaitos Painter and Onesimos are the same. In the boxing scene there are two inscriptions; one reading \\"Lukos kalos\\" or \\"Lykos is handsome\\" and the other on the discus bag reading \\"Kalos\\" or \\"handsome\\". The final inscription is found in the tondo and it reads \\"Ho pais kalos\\" or \\"The boy is handsome\\".  Connection between kylixes and athletic training  Greek kylixes and other vessels during the Archaic period frequently depicted activities such as athletic training events that were favored by their users, the majority of which were part of the aristocracy. Kylixes where often used at symposiums which were all male drinking parties. Symposiums were considered an integral part of Greek culture and was an activity reserved for only the most elite of society. The party was held in a private home where the men would get together to drink, eat, sing and discuss various topics such as philosophy and politics; the only women who were allowed to attend were high- class entertainers. It was an activity that served to reinforce the status and bond of the aristocracy. Athletic events were also an important part of Greek culture as they believed in the importance of training their bodies just as much as they trained their minds. The Grecian youths of elite families would train under athletic trainers at a palaestra or a wrestling school. These training sessions where a key part of youth socialization in society.

They are located only a few miles apart in the Thessaly region of Greece and were excavated between 1899 and 1906 by Christos Tsountas. Both settlements included a large central megaron building surrounded by smaller buildings and houses, as well as enclosing walls. The purpose of these walls has long been debated, with Tsountas initially claiming that they had defensive military purposes. However, over time more and more archaeologists have concluded that they instead functioned as retaining walls, to mark habitation spaces, as animal enclosures, or were used for ritual purposes. Regardless of their intended purpose, the fortifications reinforced the distinction between the inner settlement and outside world.  Site locations   Sesklo  Remaining foundations at Sesklo The Sesklo () settlement consists of three main phases. In general, there were close houses centered around a larger megaron with a paved courtyard. The early settlement had an unusually thick wall on the east side, but the middle to late settlements are of greater interest when considering Neolithic fortifications. Sesklo's stone walls enclosed parts of the acropolis and were approximately one meter in width. There is a possibility that they were capped with structures to create a taller barrier, but this is uncertain.  Dimini  The Dimini (ŒîŒπŒºŒÆŒΩŒπ) settlement was approximately and included a megaron in an oval courtyard with smaller buildings and houses outside of the fortifications. This site flourished during the late Neolithic period and used many of the same construction methods employed earlier at Sesklo, including stone walls. The Dimini fortifications were composed of 6 or 7 concentric circle walls that were 2‚Äì3 meters tall and as close as 1 meter apart. They were also likely made taller with mud brick or wooden palisades.  Defensive fortifications   Protection  Valuable oyster shell used by the Dimini settlement Building a wall alone has been said to be a statement about the capabilities and level of preparedness of the settlement to defend itself at the very least. The decision to build them also expresses a lack of trust that Sesklo and Dimini may have had in each other or in other Neolithic sites. These settlements felt some need to consolidate and protect themselves, indicating at least some apprehension. Further, Dimini was largely in control of production and exchange of an exotic and valuable type of oyster shell, which was used in creating personal ornaments like rings, beads, and buttons. It was generally limited to the few elites and functioned as an expression of status. Fortifications would have protected this valuable asset. Various types of weapons have been found at Sesklo, including stone projectile points, clay and stone sling bullets, axes, and knives. If these weapons were used in a warfare context, fortified sites would have provided necessary defense and protection. Note, however, that many of these weapons could have had alternative purposes, including hunting.  Construction  The Lion Gate at Mycenae, which serves a similar function as the baffle gates at Sesklo and Dimini. Other Neolithic sites in Europe built structures using the same construction methods where a military function has been argued for very convincingly, including Makriyalos in Pieria, Strofilas on Andros Island, and in northeast Bulgaria. It is unlikely that Sesklo and Dimini would have used the same mechanisms for entirely different purposes. Large empty areas of land act as buffer zone to separate settlements at war and expose invaders as they cross them to approach an opposing settlement, giving defenders the opportunity to prepare. The presence of such no man's lands in Thessaly indicates that there may have been conflict and a need for defensive fortifications. The walls at both settlements included baffle gates, a classic characteristic of other fortified sites during this time period in Greece. This feature forces invaders to expose their flanks by requiring them to turn left, exposing their unshielded right side. Sesklo had one such gate on the western side, which was not protected by the steep ravine located on the eastern side of the settlement. Dimini had 4 or 5 of these gates, as well as other narrow openings into living and working areas, which are easy to defend, would slow down and confuse invaders, and give inhabitants multiple exits.  Destruction  The remains at Sesklo indicate extensive burning and destruction, serving as significant evidence for conflict. There is information to suggest that Dimini may be to blame for the destruction at Sesklo. However, it is also important to note that the burning could have been due to other causes, including the use of flammable building materials.  Alternative functions  Upon further investigation, many archaeologists have determined there are many other likely uses for the walls found at Sesklo and Dimini. These functions include symbolic features for ritual purposes, markers of habituation spaces, animal enclosures, and organization of space within the settlement. Given the implications of building a wall, it is possible that they were meant to discourage attacks in the first place rather than to actually act as a protective measure in the midst of physical conflict. Upon later re-excavation of Dimini, no evidence of superstructures capping the walls was found, which could indicate they were not defensive in nature or they could be absent simply due to erosion. Excavators believed that fortifications implied significant social stratification, which may not have been significantly present at Dimini, suggesting the walls were used for organizing space instead. Finally, microclimates within the Thessaly region cause a fluctuation in agricultural success, making conflict dangerous and unnecessary. Some scholars argue that this promotes sharing, negotiation, and mitigation of conflict, making it unlikely that the walls at Sesklo and Dimini had military purposes.

The city was once heavily fortified, and those fortifications were tested frequently during their existence and went through several iterations before the city was eventually moved to another location.  History  The first known habitation in the area was at what is now Bayraklƒ±, several kilometers north of Izmir's city center. This site was home to the named city of Smyrna from the Iron Age to the late Archaic/early Classical period (likely in the late 4th Century BCE). The dating of the sites are based on sherds of pottery from the protogeometric and protocorinthian periods, respectively. The fortifications were heavily damaged or destroyed by a powerful earthquake around 700 BCE, and more built on top of the ruins. Around 600 BCE, the city was assaulted by King Attyes of Lydia and Wall 3 destroyed during the battle, and the city taken. Only a short time later, the Persian Empire struck and sacked the city in 545 BCE. It appears that the main city was moved into what is now Izmir during the Hellenistic period as the Bayraklƒ± location was abandoned in the late 4th Century and the primary area of habitation moved south to what is now Izmir, under which the post-Archaic Smyrna now lies.  Wall Phases  Wall 1: ca. 850-800 BCE Wall 2: ca. 775-725 BCE Wall 3: ca. late 7th Century Wall 4: ca. 4th Century BCE  Description  The primary fortifications are found at the Bayraklƒ± site, and consist of four phases of ring wall (the wall around the city), a mudbrick building, gates, and towers, dated to the mid 9th century to mid 4th century BCE. The walls are quite thick, with Wall 1 (ca. 950 BCE) being 4.75m thick at the base and Wall 2 (ca. 750 BCE) 9m thick. Wall 3 (late 7th Century) was 15m thick and the foundation in some remaining places is 5m high, but the height of the rest of the wall or the other phases of wall cannot be determined. Wall 4 (4th Century) was apparently much smaller than the rest, at 1.5m thick and served less as a fortification and more as a terrace wall. The fortifications of Smyrna were notable beginning in the 9th century due to the enormous monumental gate, built with gray and white stone. No reliable public images of the fortification site are readily apparent, nor are any descriptions of potential details or artwork on the structures. However, as much of the structures were mudbrick as opposed to the longer- lasting stone, they were not preserved.  Function  While the function may seem obvious to a modern observer (fortifications are usually for defensive purposes), at the time these fortifications were constructed they were relatively rare. Most walls were not built to defend against protracted sieges, like \\"modern\\" walls (such as Medieval castles) but instead to simply keep out bandits and keep in the animals. Such massive fortifications as seen at Smyrna were rare, and the sheer size of the walls (15 meters thick is extremely large) and the presence of bastions by one of the gates in the second phase of fortifications shows that these were more than just for show. As most armies at the time were not professional standing armies, the existence of such substantial fortifications demonstrates that the rulers of Smyrna expected a fight, and spent their resources in anticipation of that fight.

Revisiting the archives of Yiddish Theater, Amerike utilizes popular songs of the time period to tell the story of an immigrant people as they confront the challenges of living in early 20th-century New York City. With book, lyrics, and song by Moishe Rosenfeld and Zalmen Mlotek, the musical is proof that Yiddish culture and Yiddish Theatre still thrive, despite that Yiddish is on the world list of endangered languages.  Synopsis  Amerike ‚Äì The Golden Land tells the journey of America's Jewish ancestors who emigrated from their towns and cities in Europe and Russia (especially the Pale of Settlement) to start a new life in America. The characters in this story start off with a tremendous amount of hope in leaving their homes and starting new lives in NYC. However, their notions of America as a free land are shattered at Ellis Island when they witness families being torn apart to Ellis Island's selection process. Life turns out to be quite difficult in America, the characters in the show soon discover. Poor wages, long hours, and sweatshop conditions are horrors that tug at the seams of the characters. Events such as the Triangle Factory fire, Workers Unionization, the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the Great Depression, World War I, and The Holocaust ‚Äì World War II are telling points of the story in showing these immigrants growth, participation, and contribution to American economy and culture. The story ends on a hopeful and spirited note where survivors of the Holocaust are welcomed into the United States by the immigrants who fought to create a life for themselves there. Told in popular songs of the day, Amerike ‚Äì The Golden Land is performed in Yiddish with Russian and English supertitles. Productions The musical was commissioned in 1982 by the Jewish Daily Forward on its 85th anniversary for The Workmen's Circle's national convention at the Stevensville Hotel in the Catskills. The commission was aimed at creating a story about the Forward's initial audience ‚Äì the Jewish immigrants who came from Eastern Europe and Russia in the late 19th and 20th centuries. Originally titled The Golden Land, the piece was first performed in June 1982 as a concert by Avi Hoffman, Eleanor Reissa, Phyllis Berk and Moishe Rosenfeld. The piece was then developed to a full musical (still titled The Golden Land) over the next two years. A production at the American Music Theater Festival original musical based on Yiddish theater songs by Zalman Mlotek and Moishe Rosenfeld, directed by Jacques Levy (with Bruce Adler and the Golden Land Klezmer Band) moved to New York, largely intact, premiering Off-Broadway on October 28, 1985 for a 9-month run at the Second Avenue Theatre produced by Sherwin Goldman. It starred Bruce Adler, Avi Hoffman, Joanne Borts, Betty Silberman and Phyllis Berk. In 1996, the Winnipeg Jewish Theater staged a version and in 2000, the Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre (part of the Segal Centre for Performing Arts) produced a fully Yiddish version in Montreal directed by Bryna Wasserman. In 2012, the NYTF presented The Golden Land at Baruch Performing Arts Center, again under the direction of Bryna Wasserman. Despite major setbacks and weeks of canceled show from the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, the show emerged as a success, hailed as \\"a love letter to America\\" by the New York Times. The cast was made up of Daniella Rabbani, Cooper Grodin, Bob Ader, Sandy Rosenberg, Stacey Harris and Andrew Keltz. The musical was soon after developed to an expanded version retitled Amerike the Golden Land (current title) and presented in 2017 as the National Yiddish Theater ‚Äì Folksbiene's seasonal mainstage production at Museum of Jewish Heritage, again under the direction of Bryna Wasserman. The musical opened July 4, 2017 and performed for 6 weeks including a 2 weeks extension, closing August 20, 2017. The cast featured Glenn Seven Allen, Alexandra Frohlinger, Jessica Rose Futran, Daniel Kahn, Dani Marcus, Stephanie Lynne Mason, David Perlman, Christopher Tefft; chorus was made up of Maya Jacobson, Alexander Kosmowski, Isabel Nesti, Raquel Nobile, Grant Richards, Bobby Underwood.  Critical reception  The play received positive reviews. In her review for The New York Times, Maya Phillips writes \\"Amerike ‚Äì The Golden Land dares to celebrate a cultural history in which America might help shape a people, and, more important, in which a people might help shape America.\\" In her review for Time Out NYC, Helen Shaw writes \\"Wasserman deftly directs the large, talented ensemble‚Ä¶they don‚Äôt disappoint.\\" In her for Huffington Post, Fern Siegel writes \\"This essential revival is lean and smartly paced.

His paternal grandparents were Pieter Tjercks Van Schuylder and Geertruyt Philips and his uncle was Philip Pieterse Schuyler (1628‚Äì1683), the prominent colonist landowner. Through his uncle, he was first cousins with Gertruj Schuyler (b. 1654), who married Stephanus van Cortlandt (1643‚Äì1700), the patroon of Van Cortlandt Manor and a Mayor of New York City, Alida Schuyler (1656‚Äì1727), who married Nicholas van Rensselaer and after his death, Robert Livingston the Elder, Pieter Schuyler (1657‚Äì1724), the first mayor of Albany, Arent Schuyler (1662‚Äì1730), and Johannes Schuyler. Career Like others in his family, he became prominent in the fur trade. In 1697, he was elected Assistant Alderman. In 1699, he was elected Alderman representing the First Ward, serving for many years. He was considered an active member of the council and often was sent to Canada on official Albany business. In 1705, Schuyler was appointed both the Sheriff of Albany, city and county, which roles he served for a year. In 1706, he was appointed and began serving as Mayor of Albany, succeeding Johannes Schuyler.

Before the fire, the privately run theater, with a capacity of about 1700 visitors, suffered from financial problems. Officially, 384 people perished in the fire, though there are higher estimates. For example, the Prussian-born author and encyclopedian Ludwig Julius Eisenberg (1858‚Äì1910) claims that up to one thousand could have been killed. Description During that evening, Jacques Offenbach's Les Contes d'Hoffmann was scheduled. When the visitors assumed their seats at 7 PM, behind the stage five display cases were illuminated with gas lamps. Because the electro-pneumatic ignition control succeeded to light the gas only at the second attempt, the gas that had already flowed out exploded. The subsequent fire burned the fly system, and the fire quickly spread to the rest of the stage and the auditorium. It was only with a delay of half an hour that the fire brigade began rescuing the occupants, but the rescue efforts were quickly compounded by several problems: The emergency lighting used oil lamps, but they did not light. Because of scarce financial resources, they were only filled before mandatory checks were taking place. Then, the emergency exits opened only inwards, which effectively shut the victims in. Through a window at the side of the building, fresh air flowed in, which stoked the fire. Finally, because of a misjudgement, the police (the Bundessicherheitswachekorps in then-Austria) told rescuers to leave, because they thought everybody had already been rescued. Among the dead was Ladislaus Vetsera, a brother of Baroness Mary Vetsera.  Impact  After the fire, a militia rescue organization, the Wiener Freiwillige Rettungsgesellschaft, was founded. It lasted until 1938 and its duties were taken over by the Viennese city council after the war. Then, fire prevention measures were enacted. Safety curtains became mandatory in order to contain stage fires and theatre props had to be impregnated to make them fire- resistant. Likewise, the bigger theatres were forced to employ a uniformed security guard who would oversee the evacuation and must remain on-site until the last spectator has left the premises ‚Äì a rule which still stands today. The then-operator of the Ringtheater, Franz von Jauner, was sentenced to three years in prison, though his sentence was commuted by an imperial decree just a few weeks into his prison stay. The burned-out shell of the theater was demolished and emperor Franz Joseph I privately funded the construction of an apartment building on the same site. It featured a chapel on the second floor and the profits from letting the rooms were perennially dedicated to charitable causes. The psychoanalyst of later fame, Sigmund Freud, was one of the first occupants of the apartment building. In 1945, the so-called \\"S√ºhnhaus\\" (literally \\"atonement house\\") was destroyed in an air raid and was fully dismantled in 1951. The site is now occupied by the headquarters of the federal and the state police and a memorial reminds of the disaster.

Synopsis  = Cruise in the Distant Seas = Hitomi Akeneno, a psychic high school student with the power of clairvoyance and telekenesis, is invited to the maiden voyage of a cruise ship via an anomnymous invitation from a sender who claims to know her father and sister. When she arrives at the suite designated in the letter, an explosion rocks the ship. She ends up stumbling upon Merja Amabishi in the suite, the daughter of Amabishi's CEO. Merja has a device strapped to her neck, and shows Hitomi a letter she received, stating that the device is a bomb that will explode in only a few hours, unless it can be activated via three hidden keycards. The letter is signed by the \\"Ghost of W\\", and warns Merja cannot cannot seek help from more than three people, and cannot contact any officials. Hitomi and her best friend, Chisono Shio; a psychic with telephay abilities, take it upon themselves to utilize their abilities to save Merja, and discover the bomber identity, while also trying to escape the sinking ship. The trio happen upon Misaki, a famous singer. Misaki agrees to aide the trio with their crisis. During the search for the keycards, Misaki tells Hitomi about her late boyfriend Wataru who died while searching as a doctor in a civil conflict in the country of Witsarock. After all three keycards are uncovered and are placed into the device to unlock Merja's bomb, Chisono notices that the writing on the cards spells out \\"M-I-S-A-K-I\\". Misaki confesses that she put the bomb on Merja's neck, and that she is an accomplice to the mastermind. Misaki holds a deep grudge against Amabishi for their real in the Witsarock conflict which killed Wataru. She intended to kill Merja by detonating the bomb within just a few minutes, but she realized that she was simply being used by the mastermind when Merja's bomb failed to go off at the intended time. This caused her to realize the awful mistake she was making, and so joined the effort to save Merja of her own accord to recompense. The group come head-to-head \\"The Ghost\\", who is dressed in the likeness of Amabishi's mascot, Mimimi. It is revealed that The Ghost is a female, that she is a double psychic with electrokinesis and teleportation abilities, which she utilised in the execution of her plans. The Ghost tells the group that she orchestrated the entire \\"game\\" for Hitomi's sake, as a \\"tutorial\\". She also tells Hitomi that she wasn't lying about knowing her sister. The group find a way to open a route to the ship's deck make a desperate dash towards freedom. Hitomi strains herself to the limit on her telekinesis to keep the Ghost from shutting the final doors, allowing them all to get through. On the deck of the sinking ship the group wave down a helicopter in the distance. A post-credit scene reveals that the events of the \\"miraculous escape\\" has since become worldwide news. Consequently, Hitomi's status as a double psychic is now public and she has become a household name. Hitomi and Chisono decide to join the psychic research organization ZENA. Gear Detective As part of an experiment with the organisation IXG, Kyosuke Ayana, who had lost his arm and eye, agreed to be given a technologically advance prosthetic arm and a fake eye which are able to artificially replicate the rare psychic ability, chronokinesis. In the present, Kyosuke Ayana Runs a detective agency alongside his self-proclaimed \\"lover\\", Mari Sasamine. A young woman called Tsukiko Nagise arrives at the agency one day, claiming that she is being targeted by a serial killer. Investigations into the case reveal that the culprit may be a physic who is ultializing chronokinesis to forge seemingly impossible murders by altering the past. Kyosuke ultimately discovers that Tsukiko herself is the serial killer, and that the incident is connected to the death of his father, Gento Ayana. Kyosuke learns that Gento used to a researcher at an undisclosed PSI research laboratory within the country Witsarock. The laboratory kept psychic children as test subjects who were subjected to inhuman living conditions and experiments. Tsukiko used to be a test subject at this laboratory, where she befriended and grew extremely close to a fellow test subjected called Ritsu, a powerful psychic. Ritsu and Tsukiko escaped the facility which Ritsu destroyed in the process. Ritsu now wants to try and forge a world for psychics, and Tsukiko has since been working to eliminate those who stand her way, although she has been doing so independently from Ritsu. Kyosuke also discovers that his artificial arm and eye from which he gets his chronokinesis ability was created using this experiment data, that was brought by IXG. After having her plans to kill the CEO of Amabishi is foiled by Kyosuke and Mari (with the help of Hitomi Akaneno in a cameo appearance) Tsukiko is told by Ritsu to stop doing what she has been doing. Distraught at being tossed aside, and seemingly without a purpose, Tsukiko flees to the basement where she plans to kill herself by utilising an explosion. Kyosukes chases her down, and has a one-on-one with her.  Endings  * Normal ending: Kyosuke is successful at getting through to Tsukiko and the pair escape the building unharmed. Tsukiko is determined to become her own person, and atone for her crimes, while remaining Mari and Kyosuke's friend. She awaits trial, and refuses all offers and plea bargains to minimise her punishment. As per a promise made between the pair during the course of the game, Yosuke and Mari are now engaged to be married. The ending concludes with the pair walking happily hand in hand. * Bad ending: Tsukiko is not convinced by Kyosuke, and she ends up killing herself with the explosion. A distressed Mari stops acting as Kyosuke's assistant, and Kyosuke reflects on what went wrong. The ending concludes with Kyosuke not knowing if he will be able to continue on as a detective after what has transpired. * Special ending: Starts off the same as the normal ending. However Tsukiko is released on parole via a special deal. Consequently, she begins working at Kyosuke's office as his second assistant. Tsukiko and Mari also agree to \\"share\\" Kyosuke's romantic affections between just the two of them. The ending concludes with Kyosuke reflecting on how strangely okay he is with the situation as he watches his two new girlfriends having fun with each other. Crossing at the Farthest Horizon Following the events of Cruise in the Distant Seas, Hitomi Akeneno has begun working at ZENA, a psychic research facility. Since the incident on the cruise ship she has been hunting \\"The Ghost\\"; a mysterious villain of unknown identity who seems to have a personal connection to her. After receiving a letter from someone claiming to be The Ghost, she travels to the country of Witsarock. Meanwhile, the newly engaged Kyosuke Ayana and Mari Sasamine are also lead to Witsarock in their hunt the psychic Ritsu Kamiji, a powerful psychic connected to the Camellia Hills serial killing case.  Gameplay  The games are visual novel adventure games, in which the player controls a psychic. In all three games players progress through conversations with characters, as well as use a menu to navigate their way around environments to gather information and progress the story. When the character needs to escape a locked room, the gameplay shifts into escape the room sections. While the first game doesn't define these segments, the sequel defines these into two distinct segments for the conversations with characters, and escape the room gameplay, called \\"Adventure\\" and \\"Investigation\\" sections, respectively. The third game further defines the segments, by making moments involving the player navigating environments to progress the story its own section called \\"map\\", wheres the escape the room segments are called \\"search\\". Adventure gameplay During \\"adventure\\" sections, the player engages in conversations with other characters. In the first game, this took the form of linear story progression, and the player being prompted with several topics to discuss. However the sequels replace this with the player being prompted to pick a response on occasion. \\"Map\\" sections involve the player visiting locations by using various menu commands to move between locations, and interact with people, and things in the current environment via determined prompts. The purpose of these sections is to find the right actions to progress towards a linear conclusion. Search gameplay During \\"search\\" sections, the player is tasked with finding a way past a lock of some sort, ordinarily to escape a location. To do this, they interact with the environment directly by touching various things. Interacting with objects prompts a list of available commands, such as \\"look\\", to examine the object in question, or \\"press\\", to press a switch. The player can pick up objects, which puts them into the inventory in the menu. Selecting the item, then interacting with something it can be used on, results in a new prompt to appear to use the item in question. The first game includes the \\"hint\\" option that allows the player to get a hint from the characters for one of the puzzles. The sequels replaced this with the option to make the protagonist \\"think\\", where it serves the same purpose. Psychic abilities To solve the various puzzles during search gameplay, the player must use the protagonist's psychic abilities. In Cruise in the Distant Sea, Hitomi Akeneno's clairvoyance and telekinesis take the form of sections where the player must use clairvoyance to look behind a limited area of a surface. Then they use telekinesis to manipulate the area behind the surface to open a lock, or bring something out to a reachable place. This takes the form of a puzzle where they must navigate objects through maze to particular locations, or simply manipulate the environment in the right way. They have a limited amount of \\"telekinesis points\\" and \\"clairvoyance points\\" to do this. In Gear Detective and Crossing at the Farthest Horizon, the player has access to Kyosuke Ayana's chronokenisis at most times during search sections. Using this, they can look into, and interact with, the past of the current environment for up to 5 days back, by selecting the number of days back, and the time (e.g. \\"3 days back - 14:30\\"). Using a timeline of the past, they can manipulate the environment of the past to altar past events or the past environment. This causes changes to the present and progresses the puzzles. Endings and bonus modes With the exception of Cruise in the Distant Seas, the games have multiple endings, as well as a new game plus mode. The ending the player achieves is determined by stars earned at the end of each chapter: a gold star, pink star, or no star. The majority, or a lack of a majority, determines the ending, either good for gold, bad for none or no majority, or special for pink. The new game plus mode unlocks more options for responses upon a second playthrough, allowing more chances for gold and pink stars, which are required in both the second and third game in order to gain the special ending. During new game plus the player is also able to return to any chapter at any time, and are given the option to skip individual \\"adventure\\", \\"map\\", and \\"search\\" sections.  Plot and setting   Recurring elements and characters  The series takes place in an alternative world where paranormal abilities are known to exist in people born as psychics, and are studied regularly in the field of parascience. The first game follows the protagonist Hitomi Akeneno, a high school student who hides her status as the \\"world's first double psychic\\" that can use both clairvoyance and telekinesis. The protagonist of the second game is the private detective Kyosuke Ayana, who despite not having been born with psychic powers can artificially use chronokenisis via his prosthetic arm and eye. The third game features both Hitomi and Kyosuke as protagonists, with Kyosuke being the only character playable during the search segments. Hitomi is accompanied through the first game by her friend, Chisono Shio, who is a telepathy psychic. Other characters include Merja Amabishi, the daughter of Amabishi's CEO and Misaki Himekiri, a famous singer. Kyosuke is aided in the second game by Mari Sasamine, his assistant who wants him to be her husband, along with Yukiya Ousaka, Kyosuke's close friend and a secretary of IXG. In the third game, key returning characters include: Ritsu Kamiji, the \\"strongest physic\\" who is also Hitomi's sister, and Tsukiko Nagise, the culprit of the serial murder in Camellia Hills who is on probation via a special plea bargain. A major plot element in the series is the Amabishi congratulate, and its co-operative relationships with ZENA, a psychic research organization who receives their funding from Amabishi, and IXG, who is Amabishi's main rival in weapon manufacturing. The fictional former Soviet Union country of Witsarock and its heated relations with its Armagrad region also plays a major role. Armagrad recently gained its independence from Witsarock following a civil war, although they are still trying to be recognized as an official sovereign state. Another overarching theme is the relationship between psychics and ordinary humans, the former of which is a vast minority, thus regularly face prejudice, as well as the risk of having to undergo experimentation.  Reception  Cruise in the Distant Seas received mixed reviews upon its release. Ryan Craddock of Nintendo Life gave the game an 8 out of 10, stating that the game had an \\"enjoyable story\\", as well as praising the visuals and the \\"every enjoyable\\" gameplay system. However he felt as though the lengthy dialogue sections could feel \\"quite draining\\", especially given the lack of an option to save the game during these sections. Gear Detective was generally well received, and considered a better follow-up to its predecessor. FNintendo praised its well written story, as well as its interesting puzzles, while being critical of the low production value of its audio visuals. They however stated that the gameplay and overall story was solid enough for it to deserve attention, especially for its low price tag, giving it 7 out of 10. Jason Nason of Darkain Arts Gamers stated that the characters were well fleshed out, and also praised the game's script, and stated that while there were a few \\"translations hiccups\\", it was limited and the translators did a \\"solid job\\". He was also positive towards the music, which he stated was \\"pleasing to listen to\\", and overall considered the game a solid pick for its low price.

Founded in 2007, it is made up of 4 local chapters and 63 affiliate organizations around the country, along with thousands of individual members. Their work advocates for low- income laborers in the context of broader social justice issues, including immigration reform, domestic violence, and more recently the #Metoo movement. There are two million domestic workers in the US, most of whom are immigrants and women of color. They are a very diverse and largely overlooked group, and most make less than 13 dollars an hour. The NDWA advocates for a Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights, including overtime pay, one day off per week, and protection under state human rights laws.

Each page has several small pictures, sometimes as many as twenty a page, to describe the emotions visually. Some illustrations are captioned. Two birds comment on the feelings depicted on each page.  Reading Rainbow  Feelings was featured on an episode of Reading Rainbow that first aired on June 25, 1986.  Reviews  School Library Journal wrote that the number of illustrations on the page made reading the book confusing. In addition, girls were often chosen to represent negative emotions, such as envy and jealousy, while boys are used to illustrate \\"brave and courageous.\\" The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books felt that the illustrations were too small and used inconsistently throughout the book. The Santa Cruz Sentinel felt that the book \\"will delight children because it validates their feelings.\\"  Editions and revisions  Some editions of the book contain extra spreads of wordless panels on colored pages at the beginning and end of the book (not directly against the covers). Each page is a 16-panel story like the ice cream one on the front cover. In order, these stories are of a reluctant water slide rider, a girl taking care of birds outside, a broken and mended vase, and recovery from a bad dream. These are in some Mulberry and Scholastic editions. A Scholastic edition also contains a story on the back cover: two friends writing and receiving a letter. Mulberry editions (1986) have a \\"Reading Rainbow Book\\" logo in the bottom right corner of the cover and Scholastic editions (1991) have the usual Scholastic imprint on the bottom left. Scholastic editions may be stapled with no spine lettering and may also leave out page numbers. A 2019 edition is nearly identical to the original book, with the major change being a note from the author added inside the front cover. The cover art drops the old all-caps serifed title and author lettering, using a bubbly font twice the height for the title and adding \\"by\\" before the author's name (in a bold sans-serif too); it uses bolder colors for the artwork and moves the panels closer together, and adds the last panel of page 31 around the author's name. One panel on page 31 has been altered from the original, however: when the boy puffs out his chest and poses, the girl originally guesses he's illustrating \\"fat\\" (all caps, no punctuation, like \\"angry\\" and \\"sad\\" above it); in the revision, she guesses \\"Strong?\\" instead.

At the young age of twenty he staged a coup with the popular support of the commoners and overtook the Astha Mullicks or the eight regional Gauntias ruling as independent warlords in oligarchy after the Eastern Ganga administrator of the region died. The central control of the Gangas had nearly collapsed due to outside invasions. As an energetic and remarkable leader, he established his firm control of the erstwhile Patna state Odisha that might have included some parts of Chatishgarh as well. Ramai Dev ruled for 52 years as stated in the Sanskrit work of Kosalananda Kavyam written in the seventeenth century by poet Pandit Gangadhar Mishra from Puri. The details about Chauhan rule and Ramai Deva's rise to power in the region, is corroborated by three literary works in three different languages i.e. Kosalananda Kavyam (in Sanskrit), Jayachandrika (in Hindi) written by Prahallad Dubey the court poet of Surguja in the late eighteenth century and Nrusimha Mahatmya (in Odia) by Lakshmana Mishra in the late nineteenth century. Besides these Prabodha Chandrika written in the fifteenth century by the Raja Vaijala Deva of Patna state who is a Chauhan descendant of Ramai Deva himself also corroborates facts about him.  The Legend of Chauhan Arrival in Western Odisha  According to the details placed in all the contemporary literary accounts, Ramai Deva was born to one of the queens of Hutumbur Sing alias Hambir Dev or also associated with the name Vishala Dev. His father was the last line of Chauhan rulers directly descended from Prithiviraj Chauhan ruling in the Garh Sambhor region near Mainpuri in today‚Äôs Uttar Pradesh state. His pregnant queen named Asavati fled Garh Sambhor with some of her followers when Vishala Dev was killed by a Muslim king in a battle and is identified with Firuz Shah Tughlaq. Asavati found refuge in the house of a Brahmin ruler of Kholangarh division of the Patna state known as Chakradhar Panigrahi. Chakradhar Pangrahi adopted Ramai Deva and he grew closer to the common people when a man-eater tiger was hunted down by him. It was predefined by a ministerial council that the one who kills the tiger will become the king of Patna state over the Oligarchy practiced by all the eight local rulers. Ramai Deva possibly murdered or killed all the other seven rulers and became the king of the region after his foster father abdicated the throne in his favor. The eight divisions of Patna state ruled by the eight separate Gauntias or Mullicks before his time were Patnagarh, Kagaongarh, Salebhattagarh, Jarasinghagarh, Sindhekelagarh, Kholangarh, Goragarh and Kumnagarh.  Rule of Ramai Deva in Patna, Personality and Cultural Contribution  Ramai Deva had followed an unbiased policy for the people of his state. He also enforced law with an iron fist on those who did not comply, were unruly and disobedient. He recovered many areas that were lost by his previous kings and administrators of the region. He created a strong and disciplined principality in the region for the Eastern Ganga domain. Kosalananda Kavyam states that during a pilgrimage to Puri and in meeting with the Ganga king Bhanu Deva III, the later was so pleased with his karizma that he gave the hand of his niece in marriage to him. The Patna state was bound by the river Mahanadi in the north, river Tel in the south and Bindra Nawagarh area in west, which is in Chatishgarh state today. Ramai Deva was an energetic person and Kosalananda Kavya describes him as a very handsome man with a miraculous physical strength. He offered his devotion to the deities Vishnu, Shiva, Ganesha, Surya and Durga and patronized them. He built the Patneswari temple for the goddess with the same name who was the presiding deity of the kingdom. He also build a Shiva temple known as Kosaleswara Mahadeva. The priests of these temples still enjoy the five small villages granted to their forefathers by Ramai Deva for carrying out their ritual duties. The villages are Deulgan, Kalangapali, Diadumer, Uchvali and Ghunghutipali. A descendant of Ramai Deva called Balarama Deva established the Chauhan rule at Sambalpur after transferring is rule from today's Bargarh district, founded a new state called Huma Desha and dominated the region above the parent state of Patna. Balaram Deva's descendant, Baliar Singh would conquer adjoining regions to his kingdom after multiple military campaigns, one of which includes the inclusion of Surguja and some 93 battles fought with Boudh for nearly one and half a decade before finally capturing it. The foundation of Chauhan Dynasty's rule led to the stability of the region in western Odisha despite the fall of preceding central and imperial authorities in Odisha mostly based at Cuttack. Chauhans carved out the last of the most effective and essentially dominant kingdoms in Odisha after the decline of the Gajapatis and continued to rule till the nineteenth century.

Early years and education Emma Southwick Brinton was born in Peabody, Massachusetts, April 7, 1834. She was a daughter of Philip R. and Amelia D. Southwick, and the oldest of seven children. Her ancestors, (Lawrence and Cassandra,) were among the earliest colonists to this country from England. Lawrence received a gift of land for the first tanning establishment in the settlement, near Salem, Mass., on which he built the first house with glass windows They were also the first in the Colonies to be persecuted for their belief, being Quakers, and for harboring a preacher. Brinton entered the activities of New England home life at an early age. She was educated in Bradford Academy (now, Bradford College). Career When shots were fired during the Battle of Fort Sumter, Brinton was on the alert to aid those who were injured and by the collection of supplies for those who were marching to the relief of Washington D.C. Communicating with Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, of the Sanitary Commission, who was then in Washington, he soon sent for her to join the corps of nurses in Mansion House Hospital, Alexandria, Virginia. A year was spent there. Then, after a rest at home, nearly another year was spent in Armory Square Hospital, Washington. Next came service in the field at Fredericksburg, White House Landing, and City Point. At the last place, while fighting was going on around Richmond, with 35 tents full of wounded, with a constant call for food and care, scant water supply and great heat, with no shelter but a tent, where nearly all the food for her patients was provided, weeks passed into months, the overburdened nurse became a patient, and was sent to Washington and then home, broken down. Quiet and rest prepared her for some years of active service in the Freedmen's work in Petersburg and the Sea Islands. Her next move in public work was as foreign correspondent for the Boston press, and in that capacity she visited nearly all the countries of Europe, spending a summer in Scandinavia and Russia, as well as a winter in Egypt and Palestine. In 1873, she spent several months in the Vienna Exhibition, where so much interest was shown by all other countries and so little by the United States, that she resolved to take some active part in the Centennial Exposition in 1876 in Philadelphia. Having been especially interested in the illustration of the home life of the peasantry of the various provinces of Austria, with their houses, gardens and costumes, she applied for permission to illustrate the ancient life of New England by a log cabin and its accessories. At the same time, she was invited by the State of Massachusetts to take partial charge of the office of the Centennial Commission in Boston, a position which she held a year. She then went to Philadelphia and spent six months in presenting to the multitude of visitors, inside her log house, a most interesting collection of furniture and domestic utensils, which ladies illustrated. Bill H. R. 13074 was passed in the U.S. Congress in 1891 granting a pension of per month to Brinton for her service as a nurse during the Civil War. Personal life In June, 1880, she married Dr. J. B. Brinton, of Philadelphia, and while there, was an active member of the New Century Club, the Woman's Christian Association and the Woman's Hospital Staff. She lived in a pleasant home with her mother in Washington, D. C., and was interested in the various activities of that city. She was a member of the Woman's National Press Association. An enthusiastic traveler, she spent her summers, with various parties of ladies under her chaperonage, in Europe. Brinton died February 25, 1922 in Washington, D.C. and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

She graduated from the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten (State Academy of Fine Arts) in Amsterdam in 1922. She moved to Rotterdam, where she taught at a girls' school from 1922 to 1962. She began illustrating children's books in the 1920s for other authors, and she eventually began to write and illustrate her own books. She is best known as the illustrator of a series of children's books featuring a goblin named Piggelmee that were published as a form of advertising by the Van Nelle coffee company in the 1930s and 1940s. The first of the Piggelmee books, Het tovervisje (Witchcraft, 1949), was based on a story by the Brothers Grimm. Following this came De wonderschelp (The Wonder Shells, 1950), which was written in verse, and De Baas van Bos en Duin (The Boss of Forest and Dune, 1951). Her career spanned three decades, with her last work being published in the late 1950s. Her style ranged from one that was strongly linear and akin to that of illustrators such as Maginel Wright Enright, Rie Cramer, and Mabel Betsy Hill to a softer style built on color washes.

He was the father of noted Sydney jockeys Jimmie Munro and Darby Munro. History Hugh \\"Hughie\\" Munro (1861 ‚Äì 2 June 1925) was trainer for W. R. Wilson at the Whittington, Victoria, St Albans Stud, managed by C. Leslie Macdonald. Hugh trained Revenue, winner of the 1901 Melbourne Cup; he also had Wakeful, a champion mare who ran second in 1903, and seven other placegetters in the Melbourne Cup. Munro had ambitions for his two younger sons, Jim and Darby, to land the big event. He would see Jim run second on Rivoli in 1923, but died before he made the great win on Windbag in 1925, and Statesman three years later. Hugh Munro always believed his youngest son Darby, who as a lad knew how to sit on a horse, would one day become one of Australia's most notable riders. Darby would win the Cup on Peter Pan in 1934. The Munros moved to Randwick, Sydney, about 1916. Three sons were notable for their work in the racing industry: Jack Munro John Frederick \\"Jack\\" Munro ( ‚Äì 1959 or earlier) was an A.R.C.-licensed trainer, based at Warwick Farm and racing stables at Liverpool. Among the racehorses he trained were: Contrast; Coinash; La Gloria; Allunga; 1935 *A.J.C. Derby/Australian Derby; Correct; Karingal. In May 1939 Munro and jockey H. Hughes were disqualified for 12 months after stewards considered Grand Hotel \\"had not been allowed to run on his merits\\". On appeal the ban was lifted. He was in 1944 licensee of the Cootamundra Hotel in Cootamundra, later the New Zealand Hotel at the bottom of William Street, Sydney. He is not to be confused with Jack Munro, the Sydney boxing (Sydney Stadium) and coursing (Australasian Coursing Club) promoter of the same name. Jimmie Munro James Leslie \\"Jim\\" \\"Jimmie\\" Munro (7 September 1906 ‚Äì 24 July 1974) was born in Caulfield, Victoria, and was recognised by Dick Wootton and William Kelso as a talented rider when quite young, and rode for his father, completing his apprenticeship as a jockey with E. F. Walker (c. 1884‚Äì1946), the Randwick, New South Wales, trainer. He had his first Melbourne Cup ride at age 15, then in 1923 he was second on Rivoli; in 1926 he won on Windbag and again in 1928 on Statesman. His first big win was the 1922 Sydney Cup on Prince Charles, owned by John Brown. He won many other major races in Melbourne and Sydney during the 1920s: on Valicare in the Doncaster, Boaster in the Epsom and Leslie Wallace in the Sires Produce Stakes. In 1927 he was disqualified for a year following his ride on the gelding Songift at Canterbury on 18 June, along with the horse, trainer S. B. Kelly and Parkes bookmaker J. Leech, by a majority decision of the committee following some irregular betting and the horse failing at the final stretch, though to what end was never made clear. This was not the first time he came to the attention of the stewards: in 1923 he had a month's suspension for interference in the Hawksburn Handicap. He was suspended again, in April 1929 for one month, following a complaint of interference by jockey H. Birmingham and subsequent altercation in the jockeys' room. These incidents had little effect on Munro's career: he rode Phar Lap in the Rosehill Guineas on 21 September 1929, one of the great gelding's earliest wins (his first was the Rosehill Maiden Juvenile Handicap, 27 April 1929). Notable wins include: Amounis, at Caulfield *All Aged Stakes: Valicare (1926); Sir Chrystopher (1931) *A.J.C.

He won that year's German Derby at Hamburg on Alba. He returned to Australia the following year, then in 1934 accepted an invitation to ride in India, although this meant forgoing a promised ride on Peter Pan in that year's Melbourne Cup. Trainer Frank McGrath chose his brother Darby as a suitable replacement, ensuring that rider's place in Cup history. He returned to Australia, but having increasing difficulty in keeping his weight down, quit racing for training, and had some success with Tel Asur and Opulent the 1952 Sydney Cup. He spent some time in England with his daughter who had married G. Lewis, an English jockey. ;Recognition His name has been entered in the Australian Racing Hall of Fame.

He was educated at Marist Brothers' College, Randwick, and served his apprenticeship as a jockey with his brother John. By another account, Munro was born on 23 March 1913 in Melbourne but grew up in Sydney, and was \\"discovered\\" by prominent Randwick trainer Jeremiah \\"Jerome\\" Carey (c. 1867 ‚Äì 6 February 1952), and in 1925 or 1926 taken to Melbourne where he gained some experience riding Carey's horse Bicolor. This same article asserts that Darby got his jockey's ticket as his father's apprentice, but his first race was on Carey's Karuma in a Tattersall's Two-year-old Handicap on 21 May 1927, and was beaten by a horse named Rosso. Munro came into prominence in May 1927 when he won the Prospect Handicap on Release, beating his famous brother Jim on Quixotic. Later that same day he won the May Handicap on Spring Days. His services were soon in demand by such famous trainers as Jackson \\"Jack\\" Holt \\"the Wizard of Mordialloc\\" (c. 1880‚Äì1951), Bailey Payten (c. 1896 ‚Äì 9 September 1948), and Peter Riddle (c. 1885 ‚Äì 29 June 1947).

Munro was noted for his vigorous riding, especially in a tight finish. Unlike many other outstanding jockeys, he was not interested in golf, but kept himself fit by riding and swimming, an exercise he enjoyed, and never dieted to keep his weight down, though he did have a problem later on. Though daring and energetic, he seldom fell from his mount, and was never seriously injured. He was on several occasions invited to ride in England, but declined, preferring to remain in Australia. He was renowned for his stony poker face, which may have contributed to the ambivalent attitude of the public towards him: cheering his wins and booing his failures. His many fans may have considered him Australia's greatest jockey, but no-one would have denied he was the most colourful. ;Later years He appeared in cameo as himself in the 1941 comedy film Racing Luck. In February 1941 his licence was revoked for six months after a race at Ascot. He enlisted with the Second AIF in 1942 and served until 1944 when he was discharged as medically unfit. A ride on Vagabond at Caulfield resulted in a two-year disqualification. His application for a permit to ride in England in 1953 was refused, but he made appearances in California and France that year. He retired in 1955. In later years he suffered from diabetes and in 1964 his left leg had to be amputated. He died from cerebral haemorrhage and his remains were buried in the Catholic section of Randwick cemetery. ;Recognition *In 1981 a caricature of Darby Munro by Tony Rafty was featured on an Australian stamp issued by Australian Post. *His name was in 2001 entered in the Australian Racing Hall of Fame.

Around the turn of the century, Armet de Lisle began to take notice of a growing market for radium products in France. Seeking to take advantage of this opportunity and leave his own mark on the family business, de Lisle established a new factory, just outside Paris, devoted to the production of radium products in 1904. This was the first radium factory in the world. De Lisle's business was responsible for supplying the radioactive material needed by local scientists and institutions working on problems and applications of radioactivity. Among his partners was Marie Curie, whose laboratory received substantial radium material and other kinds of support from de Lisle's business. By partnering with scientists and medical professionals, de Lisle played an important role in building a burgeoning commercial enterprise around the production of radium and the study and use of radioactivity in general.  Early life and Sels de Radium  Emile Armet de Lisle was born in 1853 in France, the son of a chemical industrialist who owned a quinine plant near Paris at Nogent-sur-Marne. During his time as a student, de Lisle focused his studies on chemistry, and eventually he returned to work under his father in the family quinine business. For some time, Armet de Lisle worked as a consultant for Marie and Pierre Curie. The Curies had developed a method for extracting radium compounds from pitchblende (a radioactive ore), but the outlook of the procedure, called \\"fractional crystallization,\\" was poor. Even with an abundance of pitchblende, only very minute amounts of usable radium could realistically be harvested through the tedious procedure. In 1904, de Lisle, realizing that such a process would likely benefit considerably from an industrial scale-up and believing that there was a potentially lucrative market for radium materials in light of possible applications to medicine, began his own business venture with the creation of Sels de Radium (‚ÄúRadium Salts‚Äù). Sels de Radium, established near the family quinine plant at Nogent- sur-Marne, was dedicated to the manufacture of radium salts, and related products, using the Curie method. This included the development of devices that were used to ship the radium, or actually harness its radiation in a laboratory setting. It was the first such factory in the world. It operated initially with domestic ores, but de Lisle, confronted with the scarcity of such ores, eventually began to import a wide variety of ores including pitchblende, pyromorphite, and thorianite from foreign markets including Hungary, Canada and the United States.  Ties with the Curies and expanding the business  Among de Lisle's most important clients were the Curies. The ties between de Lisle and the Curies were mutually beneficial. The Curies, for their part, had affordable access to de Lisle's products, factory floor, and organizational resources. For example, Marie Curie's 1907 measurement of the atomic weight of radium was performed with a substantial amount of radium that had been supplied directly by de Lisle's factory. In 1908, Curie herself requested laboratory space in de Lisle's factory for expanding her own chemical work, a request which de Lisle granted. The Curies also gained office space in de Lisle's factory, part of an arrangement which served to help the Curies more effectively organize their work and manage the resources and proceedings of their own laboratory in Paris, the Laboratoire Curie. Meanwhile, the Curies vouched for the quality of de Lisle's products, and provided de Lisle with access to the intellectual and physical resources of the Laboratoire Curie. Specifically, de Lisle used researchers groomed at the Laboratoire as technicians to staff and operate his factory, and, understanding the influence and fame of the Curie name, marketed his radium products as being certified by the Curies themselves. In 1913, with the Curies' partnership secured, de Lisle attempted an aggressive expansion of his radium business. The plan was centered around boosting production through the implementation of novel radium harvesting procedures developed and patented by Erich Ebler, a professor of chemistry at Heidelberg University, as a complement to Curie's own method. De Lisle enlisted the support of Curie for this project, inviting her to serve on a committee overseeing the technical aspects of the company. However, when doubts surfaced about Ebler's methods, the plan fell apart. The relationship between de Lisle's factory and the Laboratoire Curie has been examined by several historians of science and technology. Xavier Roque has written that ‚Äúthis relationship‚Ä¶was clearly advantageous to Curie,‚Äù while Maria Rentetzi offers that de Lisle's business grew into a lucrative position at the head of the therapeutic radium industry on the strength of his connection to the Laboratoire Curie and his access to the technical knowledge it produced. Though de Lisle ultimately failed to successfully expand his business in 1913, Roque has argued that Marie Curie's willingness to be personally involved in the project is evidence of the strong and lasting partnership de Lisle forged with the Curies. However, it has also been suggested that this relationship was not totally free of complications. Roque has claimed that the fate of Jacques Danne, a longtime associate of Curie who in 1909 surrendered his position at Curie's laboratory due to lasting obligations beyond the lab, pointed to conflicts between de Lisle's and Curie's respective establishments. De Lisle also expanded his business to interface with other scientists and medical professionals in the French community. In 1905 he sent some of his products to the French physician Louis Wickham, who used the materials to conduct studies on the possible therapeutic benefits of medical radium. Wickham's work marked a significant contribution to the early understanding of how radium's ability to penetrate living tissue could be used to treat illnesses. On the strength of these early discoveries, Armet de Lisle would go on to personally fund the creation of a new institution devoted to research in radiobiology, the Laboratoire biologique du radium, which officially began studies in July 1906 and was supported by a steady stream of radium material from de Lisle's factory.  Lasting impact on the sciences  From the establishment of Sels de Radium until his death in 1928, de Lisle remained both an active participant in the French radium industry and a facilitator of its ties to the scientific and medical communities in France. Armet de Lisle helped strengthen communication and collaboration among scientists working on the problems of radioactivity. Most importantly, in 1904, he began to supervise and finance the publication of a journal dedicated to the topic, Le Radium. The journal eventually grew to encompass a wide variety of scientific topics broadly related to radioactivity, including radiophysics and radiochemistry, and gained the support of prominent scientists including Marie Curie, Ernest Rutherford, and Henri Becquerel. Armet de Lisle's funding and subsequent supplying of the Laboratoire biologique du radium was an important contribution to early French radio-chemistry and medicine, as the institute's research program helped to establish the foundational understanding required for the successful application of radioactivity to medicine. His business would also develop into the dominant manufacturer of equipment for the greater French medical community. Historian of science Soraya Boudia has written that ‚Äúindeed he became one of the most important protagonists of radium therapy in France.‚Äù Armet de Lisle played a significant role in developing Marie Curie's Institut du Radium (today the Curie Institute). In 1912, Curie, in a summary of the value of her laboratory's property, placed the value of the first gram of radium she had accumulated at one million francs. A portion of this material could be accounted for by the contributions of de Lisle's factory. With only a tenth of the radium's value being lost in payments to de Lisle and other expenses associated with procuring the ore, Curie had gained sufficient financial resources to fund the continued work and development of the Institut du Radium, which was established in collaboration between the University of Paris and Institut Pasteur in 1909. Curie envisioned the Institut as a driving force not only for the radium industry but also as a hub for French scientists carrying out bio-medical studies with radioactive substances. De Lisle supported the Institut persistently until his death in 1928.

The vase is from the region of Attica and is dated to be around 560 BC-550 BC. The design style of the vase is Attic Black Figure and features a scene on the front and back of the cup and one on the interior. The artist of the vase is considered to be the Sandal Painter.  Vase shape  Siana Cup shape The vase has a height of 0.13 meters and the diameter is 0.25 meters. The style of the vase is called a Siana Cup. The Siana cup shape is derived from another form of pottery known as the Komast cup. Characteristics of the Siana cup include a large deep bowl, a high lip, a high conical foot, and a decorated tondo. The handles are mounted on each side of the cup.  Vase decoration  There are two types of decoration styles often associated with the Siana Cup; overlap and double-decker. The decoration of the Boxing Siana Cup falls under the overlap style. In this system of decoration, the main body and the lip of the cup are used together as one area for decoration. The design was created using the black-figure technique, which was a common practice for pottery during the time period the cup was created. The painted design consists of three different figural scenes.  Side A  Greaves and Corinthian helmet: common Greek warfare items One side of the vase, known as \\"Side A,\\" depicts two warriors fighting. The two fighters are identified as warriors by their attire. They both wear helmets that cover their entire face, which distinguishes the helmets as Corinthian. For protection, the warriors hold shields and wear greaves on their legs. In their other hand, the fighters each hold a spear as their weapon and carry a sword at their waist. Each of these elements is typical of Greek warfare. Instead of a traditional shield, the soldier on the right uses a tripod, as seen by the tripod leg protruding from the base of the \\"shield\\" and stretching across the soldier's body. Despite the few elements identifying the fighters as warriors, the two soldiers are otherwise nude. The warriors are surrounded by figures that are described as spectators. Four spectators stand to the left of the battle scene and three stand on the right. The spectators are in an alternating pattern of being nude or clothed in drapes.  Side B  Depiction of ancient Greek boxing with leather wraps The opposite side of the vase, called \\"Side B,\\" contains an image similar to side A. Instead of warriors, two men are depicted boxing. Following the same theme as Side A, the boxers are nude except for the items that identify them as boxers. The fighters' hands and wrists are wrapped in leather thongs, which is what boxers commonly used for protection during standard boxing matches. The goal of ancient boxing was to knock the other opponent out by striking his head and upper body multiple times. There was little use of footwork in Greek boxing. Instead, boxers would stand in a stationary lunge-like position and rely on twisting at their hips for momentum. The boxers on the Boxing Siana Cup reflect this style of fighting. The fighters are portrayed standing with their legs planted far apart and the motion of the fight scene is depicted through their arms. Both boxers have one arm thrusting forward in a punch and the other arm pulled back in preparation to deliver another jab. Each man aims for his opponent's head and upper body. Like Side A, the boxers are surrounded by spectators on either side, in the same alternating pattern of clothed and unclothed.  Interior tondo  The interior of the cup depicts a single youth who is running and looking over his shoulder. Like Sides A and B, the man performing the athletic event is nude. However, unlike the exterior of the cup the youth is not surrounded by spectators; he is the lone image on the tondo.

Life in Italy Judith with the Head of Holofernes (1624-1626) by Virginia Vezzi, Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Nantes. The 1626 engraving by Claude Mellan that establishes Vezzi's authorship of the Judith; text at lower left reads Virginia de Vezzo pinx (\\"Virginia de Vezzo painted it\\"). Virginia Vezzi was born in Velletri in 1601. Around 1610 her family moved to Rome, where she began the study of art, likely under her father, the painter Pompeo Vezzi, and then under the French painter Simon Vouet, ten years her senior, who taught life drawing on the street where the Vezzi family resided, the Strada Ferratina. Vouet became immensely successful in Rome, and in 1624 he was elected president of the prestigious Accademia di San Luca. In the same year or shortly thereafter, Virgnia was inducted as a member of the Accademia, a striking accomplishment for a painter of her youth and gender. She painted history paintings and miniatures, and also worked in pastel.Profile at the Dictionary of Pastellists Before 1800. The only certain autograph and datable painting by Virginia Vezzi is her Judith with the Head of Holofernes (Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Nantes), engraved by Claude Mellan in 1626. This may have been the work that qualified her for admission to the Accademia di San Luca. The painting was auctioned at Christie's in 2006 for EUR 64,480.Virginia Vezzi, o da Vezzo (Velletri 1601-1638 Parigi), Giuditta (Christie's auction catalogue page) In 1626, Virginia Vezzi and Simon Vouet were married in the church of San Lorenzo in Lucina. Other paintings attributed to Vezzi A handful of other paintings have been attributed to Vezzi. All but one are roughly datable to her years in Rome. David Mandrella has suggested an attribution to Vezzi for another Judith, this one at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich (see Gallery), currently attributed to Simon Vouet, but Mandrella's argument \\"does not convince\\" longtime Vouet/Vezzi scholar Arnaud Brejon de Lavergn√©e.Brejon de Lavergn√©e, Arnauld. \\"Simon Vouet. Nantes and Besan√ßon\\" (review of the exhibition). The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 151, No. 1272 (Mar., 2009), pp. 187-189. Consuelo Lollobrigida attributes two other paintings to Vezzi, Self-portrait or Muse (1630-1632) in a French private collection (this would date to Vezzi's time in Paris; see Gallery), and an Allegory of Painting (c. 1620) in an Italian private collection, which Lollobrigida believes to be a self-portrait of Vezzi in the act of painting the young Simon Vouet (see Gallery).Lollobrigida, Consuelo. \\"Virginia da Vezzo. Un inedito e qualche riflessione,\\" Diana, nr. 2/2011, pp. 64-69. In 1992, Vouet specialist William R. Crelly suggested that Vezzi may have painted the at the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin (see Gallery).Crelly, William R. \\"Marcello Giovanetti: Sonnets et tableaux\\" in Simon Vouet: Actes du colloque international Galeries nationales du Grand Palais 5-6-7 f√©vrier 1991, edited by St√©phane Loire, Paris: La Documentation Fran√ßaise, 1992, pp. 178-9. Subsequently, a restoration of the painting uncovered a putto and an image of Jupiter that prompted the Blanton to attribute the Dana√´ to Jacques Blanchard (who painted another Dana√´, at the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon). But as recently as 2013, art historian Guillaume Kazerouni has disputed the Blanchard attribution and repeated the suggestion that the Blanton Dana√´ may be by Virginia Vezzi. Another painting, of a woman in a red dress with a blue cloak and a cream shawl (see Gallery), has been attributed to Vezzi by Kazerouni and another art historian, Adeline Collange, who both believe it may be a self-portrait; however, Arnauld and Barbara Brejon de Lavergn√©e do not believe the painting depicts Virginia Vezzi. An oil on copper Crucifixion has been listed as \\"attributed to Virginia Vezzi\\" by the Matthiesen Gallery in London (see Gallery). Simon Vouet, Virginia da Vezzo, the Artist's Wife, as the Magdalen (c. 1627), LACMA. Life in France Virginia married Simon Vouet in Rome in 1626 and the following year moved with him to his native France, where Simon, as Premier peintre du Roi, was given lodgings in the Louvre in Paris. Virginia was \\"known for her beauty...and she often served as the model for her husband's Magdalenes, Madonnas, and mythological heroines.\\" (See for example Virginia da Vezzo, the Artist's Wife, as the Magdalen at LACMA.) She also \\"augmented the teaching activities of her husband by offering drawing lessons to young ladies of good family, thereby beginning a custom traditionally associated with the Louvre.\\" The seventeenth-century French scholar Isaac Bullart described her as > ...Dame Romaine d'une beaut√© singuliere, et si bien instruite en l'Art de > peindre qu'elle eut souvent l'honneur de travailler en la pr√©sence du Roy & > de recevoir de sa bouche les lo√ºanges qui estoient de√ºes aux ouvrages de sa > belle main, que la France voit encore dans les curieuses estampes qu‚Äôon en a > mises au jour.

It has been speculated that she may have played a role in her husband's atelier, but aside from the Self-Portrait or Muse attributed by Lollobrigida, there remains \\"a lack of evidence for her activity as a painter during her years in the French capital.\\" Virginia and Simon had five children.

Biography  Early years Iowa native Zollo learned piano at age 4. His grandfather E. Payson Re was a New York jazz pianist. Zollo's music tastes were influenced by his father's extensive collection of vintage American music, and while in his teens he sang rhythm and blues songs for family and friends. High and Lonesome In 1992, Zollo founded the Iowa City pub rock band High and Lonesome (named for a Jimmy Reed song). Members included Zollo, Ruari Fennessy (guitar), Dustin Conner (bass), Darren Mattews (guitar), and Jim Viner (drums). High and Lonesome released three albums on Zollo's Trailer record label: Alackaday, Livefromgabes, and For Sale or Rent, all produced by Zollo and Bo Ramsey. Though they occasionally play reunion shows, the band dissolved while Zollo recovered from throat surgery. Zollo then formed the band Dave Zollo and the Body Electric. In 1996, Zollo moved to Nashville, joining Todd Snider's Nervous Wrecks band. When Snider downsized his band in 1997, Zollo returned to Iowa City. Solo career In 1994, Zollo released his first solo album The Morning Is A Long Way From Home, produced by Bo Ramsey. His 1998 album Uneasy Street began as a High and Lonesome recording, but was released as Zollo's solo album. It featured Ramsey, Andy Carlson (guitar, fiddle), Marty Christensen (bass), and Eric Griffin (bass). In 2002, Zollo released the album Big Night, on which he wrote all but one song. Helping out were Ramsey, Eric Straumanis (vocals, guitar), Jon Chamberlain (guitar), Chris Winter (guitar), Dale Thomas (steel guitar), Steven Howard (bass), Brad Engeldinger (drums), and Eric Griffin (percussion). For Hire in 2014 was Zollo's first recording since leaving Trailer Records. The band included Zollo, Hward, Brian Cooper (drums), and Randall Davis (guitars, lap steel guitar). Trailer Records Inspired by the example of local artists' collective Shed Records, Zollo founded and operated Trailer Records from 1994 until 2005. Trailer Records released albums by Greg Brown, Bo Ramsey, High and Lonesome, Pieta Brown, Brother Trucker, and Kelly Pardekooper. In 2005, with Zollo‚Äôs vocal chords fully recovered, he closed down Trailer Records to focus on touring and recording. Middle Western Zollo met Iowa musician William Elliott Whitmore when Whitmore gave Zollo a demo tape, and sat in with High and Lonesome in 1996. Since then, the two have performed shows together, and Zollo has played on Whitmore's albums. Zollo and Whitmore formed the band Middle Western in 2016, and planned to record an album. Other members of Middle Western include Stephen Howard (guitar, bass), Stevie Doyle (guitar, bass), and Brian Cooper (drums).

Andr√©s Amaya ( - 29 October 1704) was a Spanish Baroque painter in oils of religious subjects. He was active in the region of Castile and Le√≥n, primarily in the city of Valladolid. Biography Nothing is known about Amaya's origins and background, and little about his life and career. One modern Spanish source describes his life and activity as cubierta por una enorme bruma (\\"covered by an enormous mist\\"). The best that can be said is, that the surname \\"Amaya\\" is associated with the small village of Amaya in Burgos, Castile and Le√≥n. Few of his paintings are dated, which makes it difficult to establish a chronology. Most of his works are on religious subjects, but he is said to have also painted portraits. His surviving works are scattered in and around Valladolid. According to Spanish art historian Juan Agust√≠n Ce√°n Berm√∫dez (1749-1829), Amaya was a disciple of Vicente Carducho (1576/78‚Äì1638). Amaya cannot have been Carducho's pupil, because their dates do not overlap. It is possible that Amaya knew or was influenced by later Spanish painters of the Madrid high Baroque school, such as (after 1630 - 1677) and Francisco de Sol√≠s ( - 1684), and the court painters of the time. He has also been said to have been influenced by Alonzo Cano (1601-1667). In 1687, Valladolid painter Amaro Alonso de Llanos (Amaro Alonso M√©ndez, 1640-1699) married Damiana Jal√≥n y Gallo, widow of the painter Juan Sanz. Amaya was one of the witnesses. That is one of the very few contemporary records of Amaya's existence. His wife was Isabel (). They lived \\"outside the Puerta del Campo\\"; that is, roughly in the area of the modern in Valladolid. Amaya died on 29 October 1704. The Valladolid painter Ignacio de Prado was his pupil; Amaya's widow called Ignacio \\"una persona de mi cari√±o y de que tengo entera satisfacci√≥n\\" (\\"a person in my affection and in whom I have complete satisfaction\\"). Critical reception Ce√°n Berm√∫dez said of Amaya, \\"tienen mejor gusto de color que correccion en el dibuxo\\" (\\"he had better taste in colour than in correctness of drawing\\"). The one authority cited by Ce√°n Berm√∫dez was Antonio Ponz (1725‚Äì1792), who may only have known Amaya's altarpiece at . Spanish art historian (1935-2010) had a more generous opinion. By So had the anonymous author who wrote for the Museo Nacional de Escultura, Valladolid in 2001, \\"Fue artista bien preparada para la composici√≥n, mostrando gran habilidad en la angrupaci√≥n y relaci√≥n de las figuras\\" (\\"He was a masterful artist in composition, showing great skill in the grouping and relationship of people\\").

Ward, Fritz M. Heichelheim, and Cedric A. Yeo, History of the Roman People (Abingdon: Routledge, 2016). The law was proposed by Lucius Villius Annalis, a Tribune of the Plebs, after previous debate within the senate pertaining to the age requirements for magistracies. These debates had arisen due to an increase in competition from a rise in new families attempting to gain success and social change within Roman society, which placed pressure on the political sphere. Where previous laws had failed to be passed or were too ambiguous to result in change, the Lex Villia Annalis has been described as having created a standard for a career in the cursus honorum.Hans Beck, Martin Jehne, and John Serrati, Money and Power in the Roman Republic (Bruxelles: √âditions Latomus, 2016). Significant debate has arisen over the context and content of the law, given the minimal number of references provided within antiquity. It is questionable as to the level of detail within the law and whether or not it arose out of a formalisation of past customs.Harriet I. Flower, Roman Republics (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2010).  Background and Creation  The Lex Villia Annalis appears to form a part of several legislative changes that sought to ease the intensity of political competition (there was a high level of bribery and corruption resulting from the growing number of candidates for the curule seat) and the irregularity by which individuals could achieve the senior magisterial positions. A number of laws proposed and carried out at the beginning of the second century suggest a greater legislative movement concerned with a further regulation and codification of the cursus honorum. For example, there was a law passed in 184 BC which ruled that 'a politician might not hold two curule offices simultaneously' (Livy 39.39.4).Richard J. Evans and Marc Kleijwegt, \\"Did the Romans like Young Men? A Study of the Lex Villia Annalis: Causes and Effects\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 92 (1992): 181-195. Richard Evans asserts that the lex Villia annalis was related to the preceding lex Baebia and lex de ambitu; these laws were respectively passed in 181 by consular colleagues P. Cornelius Cethegus and M. Baebius Tamphilus to combat electoral corruption. Alan E. Astin, Cato the Censor (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978). The lex Baebia is said to have reduced the praetorian college from six to four members in alternate years (Livy 40.44.2), while the lex de ambitu further dealt with 'political malpractice'. There is also good reason to suppose that a similar piece of legislation to the lex Villia annalis (referred to by Cicero as the lex annalis), which sought to enact age requirements for public magistracies, was also proposed in 181 and was most likely drafted by a certain Marcus Pinarius Rusca (Cic. De or. II.65). There is no surviving information about the contents of this law, and it appears to have failed. In 180 BC, the tribune of the plebs Lucius Villius Annalis made a successful proposal for a law that regulated 'the ages at which each magistracy might be sought and held' (Livy 40. 44). Evans noted that the law likely introduced an 'obligatory biennium between curule offices, or at least between praetorship and consulship'.  Function  The Lex Villia Annalis formalise limits on the minimum age at which a Roman politician could ascend to a particular magistracy on the cursus honorum. It formalised a set of requirements to ascend to a magistracy which previously were likely informal but widely subscribed to. This included a minimum age for each of the senior magistracies above and including the aedileship, as well as a requirement for 10 years of military service at the equestrian level or 16 years of military service as an infantryman. The age limits, as laid out by Evans, were: * 36 years of age to be qualified for the aedileship; * 39 years of age to be qualified for the praetorship in the 2nd century; * 42 years of age to be qualified for the consulship. While the law served to impose limits on who could actually apply for individual magistrates, there is much conjecture on how necessary the law actually was and the extent to which it served an important function. While later challenges to the law became increasingly prevalent following Gaius Marius, from its passing until the latter second and first century BC it served as a powerful check for young men seeking office by limiting how early they could run for political offices in all but the most exceptional circumstances. There are two primary methods by which these limits have been ascertained. The first is by allusion to them in ancient sources: for example, Cicero in his fifth Philippic oration refers to the death of Alexander the Great at the age of 32 and says, 'Did not the Macedonian Alexander, having begun to perform mighty deeds from his earliest youth, die when he was only in his thirty-third year? And that age is ten years less than that fixed by our laws for a man to be eligible for the consulship' (Cic. Phil. 5.48). This quotation from Cicero directly evidences the minimum consular age of 42. The other method which is used by Alan Astin is to look at the various ages at which certain individuals became consul, and to a lesser extent, at what ages they attained the lesser magistracies. Following the observance of patterns, Astin sought to calculate quantifiable limits, and the data which he finds seems to confirm the trends. Even in situations where an exceptional candidate such as Scipio Aemilianus attained the consulship early at the age of 36, special legislation was required to be passed before he was able to take the office. Some scholars such as Theodor Mommsen disputed the extent to which the law would actually have played a part in imposing limitations. As counter-examples, he cites the principle of biennium (the requirement for magistrates not to serve in consecutive years), the already required 10 years military service prior to holding office, and the rigidity of the cursus honorum. However, simply because the law was 'otiose' did not mean that it was not passed, as Astin shows.Alan E. Astin, \\"The Lex Annalis before Sulla\\", ' 17, no. 1 (1958): 49-64. While perhaps not fundamentally changing the way Roman political magistracies could be obtained, the Lex Villia Annalis formalised rules and regulations surrounding its passing.  Later Challenges to the Law  Throughout the second and the first century of the Roman Republic, the Roman people challenged or ignored the lex Villia Annalis on multiple occasions. This was often the case when the Romans were faced with war.  Scipio Aemilianus  In 147 BC, Scipio Aemilianus was made consul for 148 by the Roman people while still under the minimum age for the consulship.Louise Hodgson, \\"Appropriation and Adaptation: Republican Idiom in Res Gestae 1.1\\", Classical Quarterly 64, no. 1 (2014): 254-269. The voters bypassed this law since they believed that the exceptional circumstances surrounding the Third Punic War required them to do so and more importantly, that it was their prerogative to do so. Appian summarises this prerogative like so: ‚Äòby the laws handed down from Tullius and Romulus the people were the judges of the elections, and that, of the laws pertaining thereto, they could set aside or confirm whichever they pleased‚Äô (App. Pun. 112). After the Roman people had made him consul, Scipio Aemilianus was immediately assigned to campaign in Africa without the need to draw lots to decide his campaign location.Jessica H. Clark, Triumph in Defeat: Military Loss and the Roman Republic (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014). This procedure was normally undertaken by new consuls, and so the Roman peoples‚Äô ability to skirt their own long-standing traditions calls into question how concrete the lex Villia Annalis really was, or Roman legislation in general. The Roman peoples' judgement were, however, correct: Scipio Aemilianus successfully took Carthage in 146, thus ending the Third Punic War.  Gaius Marius  In 105 BC, Gaius Marius was for the second time elected as consul, this time for 104. This occurred after his victory in the war with Jugurtha, only to find that the Germanic tribes of the Cimbri and the Teutones were gradually becoming a threat to Italy. The Roman people thought it necessary to have the same competent leader to deal with the fresh threats, even if it meant violating the lex Villia Annalis, a law which their ancestors had passed.Mark Everson Davies and Hilary Swain, Aspects of Roman History 82BC‚ÄîAD14: A Source Based Approach (London: Taylor and Francis, 2010). Consequently, the Cimbrian War commenced between the Roman Republic and the Germanic tribes. Just as the lex Villia Annalis stated that there was to be a biennium between magistracies, it seems that it was also illegal to hold subsequent consulships within a short time frame, since Plutarch recorded that ‚Äòthe law forbade that a man in his absence and before the lapse of a specified time should be elected again‚Äô (Plutarch Mar. 12). Marius fulfilled both criteria: firstly, he was elected consul for the second time while away in Africa and secondly, he held his second consulship only three years after his first consulship.  Pompey  In response to Marius' disregard for the cursus honorum (he had held the consulship seven times), Sulla tightened the regulations of the cursus honorum in 81 BC to prevent ambitious young men from ascending to the top of the political chain too quickly. Although the regulations required a minimum age of 39 for the praetorship, Pompey was granted pro-praetorian imperium to lead an army against the Marians in Africa and Sicily when he was only 24 years of age (App. Mith. 14.91-96). Completing the task in 40 days, Pompey returned and demanded a Roman triumph to recognise his achievement. Sulla initially refused the triumph as such a request was against his own restatement of the lex Villia annalis (lex Cornelia de magistratibus), but capitulated when Pompey refused to disband his army, reportedly muttering the famous words that 'more people worship the rising than the setting sun' (Plut. Pomp. 14.3).

By 1976 it had 33 charters and over 7,000 initiates. From the beginning the Fraternity exhorted its members to a high degree of personal and professional conduct. At founding, the three men who established the Fraternity wrote in their own handwriting into the preable of its constitution: > \\"We the undersigned students of the Law School of the University of Maine, > with a view of establishing on this and other schools of law, as well as in > the general practice of the profession, an elevated standard of personal > deportment, a high code of professional ethics and a broad and catholic > development of mental culture and moral character, do associate ourselves in > the lasting bonds of a fraternal union under the name of Gamma Eta Gamma.\\" The pledge manual included chapters on how to study law effectively, a chapter on etiquette, and general fraternity information. Minnesota Chapter of Gamma Eta Gamma law fraternity, 2014 Founders The founders were: *Charles Vey Holman *Charles Hickson Reid, Jr. *Harold Dudley Greeley. Conventions and Government The convention, called a \\"Witan\\", was at first held annually beginning in 1901. Later this shifted to a biennial basis, with province conferences held in off years. While the Fraternity had multiple chapters, in the interim between conventions, management responsibilities were held by a council of twelve members called the \\"Curia,\\" consisting of four elective executive officers and officials from the eight provinces of the fraternity. Eight of these twelve leaders were required to be alumni. By 2017, there was one remaining active chapter, at the University of Minnesota Law School. Governance is now held by this successor chapter, managed as an informal, local fraternity with cooperative housing, in Minneapolis.The Minnesota chapter's University portal provided additional information, accessed 6 Sept 2020. Traditions and Insignia Founders' Day is generally held on the anniversary of founding, February 25. However some chapters celebrated the Prandium Cancellari on June 7, which was the date of the fraternity's first banquet in 1901. The badge is a shield with a lamp, a star and a Roman fasces or bundle, above the motto. A triangle encloses the letter Œ† with Œì on both sides and below a balance. The official badge contains 20 pearls surrounding the shield. The outgoing president, or High Chancellor is awarded a badge with a diamond border. The pledge pin is a circular button, with the letters Œì Œó Œì appearing in a circle on a red field, imposed on a triangle, with the rest of the button in black.

Narrative overview  The Sassanian Persian kings Shapur I (ruled 239-270 CE) and Shapur II (ruled 309-379) both struggled against the Roman Empire and deported prisoners of war to other areas within their own empire.For the deportations under Shapur I, from eastern Roman provinces, see For Shapur II's fighting with Rome, and his deportation of Armenians, see The Acts of Pusai seems to have mixed these two rulers into a single \\"Shapur\\" in producing the narrative about Pusai, who is said to have descended from Roman captives of Shapur. According to the Acts, Pusai married a Persian woman, converted her to Christianity, and baptised their children. Pusai and his family were relocated by Shapur to the new settlement of Karka d'Ledan, near Susa. The intention of Shapur was to bring deportees from a variety of regions to the new city so that they would intermarry and therefore lose interest in returning to their homelands. The narrator records that while Shapur did this for self-interested reasons, God used this intermingling to spread Christianity. There Pusai worked as a skilled craftsman in the making of fine cloth. The king took notice of his skills, and promoted him and regularly gave him gifts. Pusai was martyred in the year 341. Shapur began persecuting Christians, and when Pusai witnessed the martyrdom of one Christian, Pusai encouraged the man, soon to be killed, to close his eyes and think of Christ. Pusai was immediately reported to Shapur, who had him arrested. He was interrogated by Shapur, and argued against Shapur's Zurvanite religious ideas. Instead of renouncing his faith, Pusai announced that he was willing to die for it, and was killed by having his tongue torn from his mouth. His daughter Martha, who had taken a lifetime religious vow of celibacy, was taken into custody and put to death a little later.

Early life Before his teen years while attending St. Barbara School in Brookfield, Jim‚Äôs brother Dennis brought home the vinyl 78rpm ‚ÄúRock Around the Clock‚Äù by Bill Haley And His Comets, that accelerated Jimmy‚Äôs interest. With money saved, Jim bought his first guitar along with a Mel Bay chord book at the age of 12. Dennis found out the frustrations about how hard it was to push the strings down to the fret board and had an idea. When their father asked Dennis what he thought Jimmy would like for Christmas that year the answer was a better guitar. That Christmas Jim unwrapped the princely sum of $75, a Hofner archtop guitar. That spring, Dennis suggested to his father that Jimmy would like a DeArmond pickup and a Supro amplifier for Jim‚Äôs birthday. In 7th grade he formed The Rockin‚Äô Rebels. His first paying gig was at the opening of a Go-Kart Shop in Lyons, IL. A couple years of guitar lessons plus a recording session featuring two blues-progression instrumentals, Jim entered Lyons Township High School as a freshman in 1959. Then, he played in a group called Jimmy & The Jesters. His father drove him to Record Row on the south side of Chicago. Within a few blocks of each other were the labels Vee Jay, Constellation, King and Chess Records. Jim met Chess Records A&R; Willie Dixon with his acetate tape in hand. Even though Jim was turned down, to his advantage, he received constructive criticism that would help him. Jim also met Leonard Chess and Curtis Mayfield who influenced Jim‚Äôs songwriting and guitar playing. While in high school, he purchased a sunburst-finish Fender Stratocaster, played and recorded a couple of songs on Terry Records with an Aurora,Illinois band named The MayBees and met his longtime collaborator, Gary Beisbier. During his junior and senior years, Holvay connected with Jim Lounsbury, the local TV dance show host, and played at the Lounsbury record hops in Illinois, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin. Holvay graduated in 1963 and joined a band called The Chicagoans with Gary. In the summer of ‚Äô63, The Chicagoans became the house band on ‚ÄúDanceville, U.S.A.‚Äù Lounsbury‚Äôs weekly live TV show. In the fall, the group moved to New York and played The Peppermint Lounge, The Metropole Cafe and Arthur's Tavern. The Chicagoans went on tour traveling to countless venues across the U.S. and Canada. One recording session yielded an instrumental written by Holvay and Beisbier titled ‚ÄúBeatle Time.‚Äù WLS Program Director Clark Weber suggested the group should be called The Livers (referring to Liverpool) and the record charted on the Silver Dollar Survey in the spring of 1964. After tours playing ballrooms thru out the midwest backing up Terry Stafford, Chubby Checker, Nino Tempo & April Stevens- the group moved to San Francisco. Then, they worked clubs in North Beach (pre-‚ÄùMonterey‚Äù) alongside Sly Stewart & his Mojo Men, The Beau Brummels, Pat & Lolly Vegas, The Gauchos, The Nooney Rickett 4. Afterwards, Jim returned home and registered for Junior College. While in college, Jim wrote and produced various local artists, most notably, Ral Donner and Dee Clark. Then Jim was offered a gig as the guitarist for the Dick Clark Caravan of Stars.

The Caravan Of Stars was a road show featuring some of the most popular stars and musical groups produced and presented by Dick Clark. While on the Caravan Of Stars bus, Jim and Brian Hyland wrote songs together. Later, Jim enrolled back in junior college. The MOB first to feature The Chicago Horn Rock Sound One goal was to help finance school tuition by playing clubs with a ‚Äúdream‚Äù band. November 1965, Sistak posed the question to Holvay. ‚ÄúJim. If you could wave a magic wand, what kind‚Äôve [sic] a group would you put together?‚Äù Holvay responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd put together an ass-kicking horn band with the best musicians I could find. We‚Äôd play soul music and have the greatest live show that ever existed. It‚Äôs never been done before.‚Äù After seeing an old gangster movie on a late night movie TV channel on WGN, Holvay came up with the concept for the group. The name of that old movie was called The MOB. The group will have a full blown horn section, singers, etc., so there‚Äôll be a mob of people on stage. Being from a gangster town, the group will wear pinstripe suits, black shirts, white ties and carnations., Carolina Beach Music: The Classic Years By Rick Simmons. WLS Radio may have been the first station to break ‚ÄúCherish‚Äù by The Association, which went to number one and subsequently spread across the country. The record label flew The Association out to Chicago to thank the jocks at the station for playing the record and making it number one. After their visit to the radio station, Terry Kirkman and the guys said that they asked who the hot band was in town. The jocks told the fellas, ‚ÄúGo see The MOB out at a club near O‚ÄôHare‚Äù. (i.e. The Wine and Roses) The MOB met The Association and became good friends, which resulted in The MOB becoming their opening act on a lot of their college dates (years later, The Association‚Äôs manager Pat Collechio, became The MOB‚Äôs manager). The Association flew back home to LA and told Capitol Records that they need to sign this great band which they had just seen in Chi Town. Within a few weeks, The MOB recorded in Studio A at the famous Capitol Records tower on Vine Street in Hollywood. It may have been believe Nik Venet who produced three songs that Gary and Jimmy had written. After that session, The MOB flew back home to continue residency at The Wine and Roses and waited to hear what the verdict was on our newly created horn rock sound. Note, at that time, every group in Chicago consisted of two guitars, bass and drums or maybe a Vox organ or a sax. Sal Innucci (the then President of Capitol Records) heard the traks and said, ‚ÄúDump the horns and add more guitars‚Äù. The group wasn‚Äôt going to do that because that‚Äôs not who the group was. The MOB felt they had something different and unique that would separate us from all of the Beatle influenced bands there were happening at the time. Songwriting Carl Bonafede was a Chicago band promoter for weekly dances at local ballrooms. He managed The Buckinghams when Carl gave Jim a call. Jim Holvay first met Carl Bonafede at a Jim Lounsbury record hop, the Willowbrook Ballroom, while Carl was singing with the Gem-Tones back in 1960. Carl told Jim that The Buckinghams covered Beatles songs and Jim replied that he wrote R&B;/soul songs. \\"I was dinking around on a spinet piano in a music practice room at Lyons Township Junior College and wrote Kind of a Drag. I wasn't sure Carl remembered I was a songwriter until he asked if I had any tunes. Yeah, I do have something, and Carl asked when he could hear it. I remember cutting a demo of the song on acoustic guitar between shows,\\" he recalled. Later Carl with a Wollensak tape recorder, found Jim at a club where, in the dressing room, he played his ‚Äúpop genre‚Äù tune on an acoustic guitar. Months later ‚ÄúKind Of A Drag‚Äù was on WLS Radio. Turns out that the producer added horns to the song because of hearing The MOB perform at clubs around town. He knew Jim Holvay of the R & B group the MOB to be a good songwriter from previous use of his songs. The-Mob South Dakota Rock And Roll Music Association inductee Located in Sioux Falls, SD during the 70‚Äôs was the renown showroom, the Mocamba Club. Top acts played the club and The MOB is said to be, the most booked act and the biggest draws that the Mocamba Club had. October 2010, Don Fritz, President of the South Dakota Rock & Roll Music Association informed that The MOB was selected under the category ‚Äúbands‚Äù. Inducted April 16, 2011 at the Ramkota Exhibit Hall in Sioux Falls, SD more than 2,000 people in attendance saw and heard The MOB in person, their first reunion in 35 years. Eastside Heartbeats, a new Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll musical Jim was interviewed by Tom Waldman for a 2014 KLCS-TV PBS episode of Rock ‚ÄòN Roll Stories. Tom co-wrote the 1998 book \\"Land Of A Thousand Dances: Chicano Rock ‚ÄòN‚Äô Roll From Southern California\\" with David Reyes. Waldman wrote a script based on the music scene of East L.A. in the sixties and showed Holvay. Tom then asked Jim to compose music for the play. The tunes were to feel like Cannibal & the Headhunters‚Äô ‚ÄúLand of a 1,000 Dances‚Äù but original. The songs, sung by an unknown group following their dream and opening for a group like The Beatles at a venue similar to the Hollywood Bowl in 1965. Holvay worked with David Reyes, Rudy Salas and Tom Waldman resulting in the soundtrack for Eastside Heartbeats-The Musical.

Gameplay  The player plays as either a \\"Metalface\\" or a \\"Protobot\\". The Metalfaces try to defend the bomb-sites, while the Protobots try to attack and plant a bomb. When the Protobots plant the bomb, the Metalfaces must try to defuse the bomb before it explodes. The Protobots win when they kill all of the Metalfaces, and the Metalfaces win then they defuse the bomb. At the end of each round, players can choose to buy armor, weapons, or vehicles. While the game mainly focuses on the online multiplayer game mode, there is a mode where the player can play against offline bots.  History  Cobalt WASD is a separate stand-alone spin-off of Cobalt. The developers saw that the original game was too complex for some players and its higher price point discouraged some players, so they wanted to make a completely different game. They decided to make a spin-off of Cobalt, focusing on just one game mode.  Reception  Cobalt WASD has been called a \\"very funny and competitive multiplayer game\\" and a \\"2D version of Call of Duty's Search and Destroy game mode\\".

History As one of the oldest racing clubs still existing in the Asia-Pacific region, the Manila Jockey Club was established in 1867 by Governor General Jos√© de la G√°ndara y Navarro along with about 100 people from Spanish, American and Filipino clans from Manila. Initially, the club founded in Quiapo, held races that were only for recreation purposes where no betting is involved. Annual horse races called \\"fun runs\\" were organized by the club which ran from San Sebastian Church to Quiapo Church was held. By the 1880s, the club moved out of Quiapo which was then becoming a commercial and residential hub for business tycoon to a rice field along Pasig River in then-rural Santa Mesa which was rented from the Tuason family. An oval track, as well as a nipa and bamboo grandstand, was set up at the site. At least two racing meets were held at least twice starting from 1881. Initially, only members of the clubs could compete in official races while professional jockeys were allowed to compete in two of the average eight races a day. Following the Pact of Biak-na-Bato signing in 1897, the MJC organized the Gran Copa de Manila a horse race which was later cancelled due to Battle of Manila Bay which led to the end of the Spanish colonization of the Philippines. The horse racing club temporarily closed until it was reopened in 1899. In 1900, the MJC moved to San Lazaro in Santa Cruz. The property was leased from the Monasterio de Santa Clara. Horse racing which was previously an activity followed and practiced by the rich began to be patronized by the masses when horse race betting was introduced in 1903. The proceeds of the race either went to the improvement of MJC's assets or to charity organizations. The property was bought by the MJC in 1912 and a new grandstand and six-furlong turf track were built after the purchase. The club had to close down again when the Japanese soldiers used the club's buildings as their barracks in 1943 during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines of World War II. After the Battle of Manila of 1945, American soldiers took over the club's facilities and used them as their garrison. The Americans later use the facilities as a hospital. Members of the club regained control over their facility in March 1946 and within two months after reconstruction efforts, the San Lazaro Hippodrome resumed operations. MCJ was incorporated decades later after its establishment in 1937 under the name, \\"Manila Jockey Club, Inc.\\". It transferred out of the San Lazaro Hippodrome to its current site in Carmona, Cavite. Since then it holds races at the San Lazaro Leisure Park. Other sports Aside from horse racing, the Manila Jockey Club has been involved in football. It had its own football club in the early 1900s which was organized after the end of the Philippine-American War. MJC's football team competed with other local teams such as the Manila Sporting Club, the Paris Club, the Sandow Athletic Club, and the Bohemian Sporting Club. It has also worked with the Philippine Football Federation to establish the National Training Centre, a football training center within San Lazaro Leisure Park.

His body was found with injuries to the neck outside a washroom at the school on 8 September 2017, and he later succumbed to his wounds. He was seven years old at the time of his death. A bus conductor who provided assistance with carrying the injured Pradyuman was initially charged with the murder, and confessed to police, but was later found to be innocent. An unnamed sixteen year student from the same school has since been charged with his murder, following an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation. The case is still ongoing. Thakur's death attracted public concern and criticism for the conditions regarding safety in schools in Delhi. A number of government reviews of Ryan International School's functioning were conducted following the investigation into Thakur's death, and revised guidelines for safety in schools were issued by both, State and Union governmental bodies. Murder  On 8 September 2017, Barun Chandra Thakur drove his 7 year old son, Pradyuman, and 11 year old daughter Vidhi, to Ryan International School, in Gurugram, Haryana, where both children were students. Thakur later stated that he had begun driving his children to school instead of sending them by school bus, because of safety concerns. Thakur left his children at the school gates at 7:55 a.m. At 8:08 a.m., several students alerted school staff that Pradyuman had been injured, and was bleeding from two neck wounds, outside a washroom near his classroom, on the ground floor of the building. A teacher and several other staff members asked a school bus conductor, Ashok Kumar, to assist them with carrying Pradyuman to a car belonging to one of the school teachers, and drove Pradyuman to a nearby hospital in Badshahpur. He was transferred from there to Artemis Hospital in Gurugram, where he was declared dead on arrival. Pradyuman's parents, Barun and Sushma Thakur, were contacted by the school authorities after he was found, at 8:15 a.m, and went directly to the hospital where he had been taken. They later stated to press that school officials had not informed him about the injuries their son had suffered,and that the police had not been called by the school, but instead had been called by themselves. Several hundreds attended the last rites for Pradyuman, who was cremated with police protection, in Gurugram.  Investigation   Haryana Police Investigation  = Initial investigation and arrest of Ashok Kumar = The Haryana Police were alerted about the incident and arrived at the school at 11:30 AM on the same day. Police officials stated that a blood stained knife was recovered from the area where Pradyuman was found, and a police forensics team examined the area and collected evidence, including fingerprints, from the area. CCTV footage recovered from the hallway near the scene of the crime showed Pradyuman attempting to crawl out of the washroom, while bleeding from the neck, before collapsing in the hallway. Police detained and questioned ten persons, and observed blood stains on the shirt of Ashok Kumar, a school bus conductor who had assisted with carrying Pradyuman to a car which took him to the hospital. A cellphone video recorded by a witness at the scene of the crime showed school authorities asking Kumar to help pick up Pradyuman to transport him to the hospital. Kumar was arrested by the Haryana Police in connection with the murder at 12 noon, on the same day. The Deputy Commissioner of Police, Sumit Kumar, stated that Kumar had arrived with a school bus at 7:50 AM and had gone to the ground floor washroom in the school building, which was commonly used by staff and students. According to the police, he was carrying a vegetable knife that he had found in the bus tool kit, and had gone to the washroom to rinse off the knife before taking it home for his own use. When Pradyuman entered the washroom, the police suggested that Kumar attempted to sexually assault Pradyuman, and on meeting with resistance, had attempted to murder him with the knife, which was left behind at the scene of the crime. Police officers further stated that eyewitnesses, including other students at the school, placed Kumar at the scene of the crime when Pradyuman was assaulted. Haryana Police also initially told a Gurugram court that they believed an additional suspect was involved, and that an attempt had been made to tamper with the crime scene. However, this statement was contradicted by a senior police official who stated to the press that \\"Only Ashok has murdered Pradyuman, no other person is involved.\\" Kumar reportedly confessed to the police that he committed the murder, but later claimed he was coerced and did not commit it. He later stated that he had been tortured by the Haryana Police while in custody, and that he had confessed to prevent being further tortured. Kumar stated that he was denied food for two days while in custody, and was repeatedly slapped and beaten by police officials. Following Kumar's arrest, a Bar Association in Gurugram passed a resolution stating that its members would not defend Kumar against the accusations of murder of Pradyuman Thakur. The Bar Association subsequently retracted their position when he was released on bail after being cleared by the CBI. Kumar's family stated that he was eventually able to obtain legal representation after reaching out through personal connections. The Supreme Court subsequently disciplined the Bar Association for this resolution. = Release of Ashok Kumar = The arrest of Ashok Kumar was met with public doubts and concern, including from Pradyuman Thakur's family. Thakur's mother stated later that she had believed the conductor was being framed. Saurabh Raghav, a bus driver working for Ryan International School on the bus which Ashok Kumar conducted, later stated that he was pressured by the Gurugram Police to state that the knife found at the scene of the murder was part of the bus tool kit. A medical examination of Pradyuman Thakur's body ruled out any sexual assault. Another witness, a school gardener named Harpal Singh, who was one of the first on the scene to find Pradyuman, stated that he had not seen any bloodstains on Kumar's clothes before he assisted with picking up Pradyuman to take him to hospital. Harpal Singh also stated that he had also been repeatedly physically assaulted by the police in an attempt to force him to confess to the murder. On 22 November 2017, Kumar was granted bail by a District Court in Gurugram. Following the arrest of another student for the murder, Haryana Police stated that while Ashok Kumar had been arrested, no charges had been filed against him as the investigation was still ongoing. The Central Bureau of Investigation subsequently cleared Kumar of any involvement in the murder. A forensic investigation by the CBI found that Pradyuman's body had bloodstains that were not matched to himself, and that Kumar was also ruled out forensically as a match. The CBI also stated that the Haryana Police's claim that a semen sample had been found on Pradyuman's body and had been sent for testing could not be confirmed, and that they could not find any evidence that such a sample had been found or tested. On 28 February 2018, Kumar was acquitted of all charges by a special court. The National Human Rights Commission ordered the Haryana Police to compensate Kumar for the wrongful arrest, but he declined to accept, terming the compensation to be insufficient. Kumar has sought legal action against the police officers who arrested him.  CBI Investigation  = Transfer of Investigation to CBI = The initial investigation of the murder by Gurugram Police was met with wide public criticism, including by Pradyuman's father, Barun Thakur, who filed a petition at the Supreme Court, asking for the investigation to be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). On 15 September 2017, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced that the case had been transferred to the CBI in response to requests by the parents of Pradyuman Thakur, although he affirmed that in his view, the investigation had been correctly handled by the Haryana Police. The Haryana Police also denied any mishandling of the investigation, stating that their findings were preliminary and that the investigation had still been ongoing when it was transferred to the CBI. Pradyuman Thakur's family stated that they had asked the CBI to investigate the possibility of the involvement of other students at the school in Pradyuman's death, as they had received information that some older students had consumed alcohol in the presence of younger students and had threatened the younger students to prevent them from telling school authorities. = Investigation = The CBI sent a forensic team to the school to review the evidence and scene of crime independently from the Haryana Police investigation on 22 September 2017 . They took over custody of the persons arrested by the Haryana Police. Following their investigation, the CBI identified a different knife as the murder weapon, stating that they had recovered it from the scene of the crime and that it had been hidden inside one of the washrooms. This contradicted the Haryana Police's statement that a knife recovered at the scene of the crime was the murder weapon. The CBI also reviewed CCTV footage from the crime scene and found that there were some students visible in the footage apart from Pradyuman Thakur. The CBI worked with the school administration to identify these students and then questioned them. = Arrest of Unnamed Student for Murder = On 7 November 2017, the CBI arrested an unnamed class XI student, aged 16, from Ryan International School for Pradyuman Thakur's murder, from his home. The student was one of the first on the scene of the crime, and had told school authorities that another student had been injured. The Haryana Police later stated that while they had questioned the unnamed student as a witness, they had found no evidence suggesting that he was responsible for the death of Pradyuman Thakur. Following his arrest, the Juvenile Justice Board gave the CBI permission to interrogate the student. Based on CCTV footage, the CBI questioned the unnamed student, who could be seen on the footage exiting the washroom around the time that the crime was committed. They also stated later that cellphone records and forensic evidence were used in order to identify the student. Following the arrest, the CBI also took the arrested unnamed student back to the school and recreated the scene of the crime. The CBI stated that they were also able to establish that the knife recovered from the washroom had been purchased by the unnamed student at a local market, a few days previously. They also seized his computer and phone and stated that the student's social media was being investigated for evidence regarding the crime. The CBI further stated to a Juvenile Court in Gurugram that on questioning, the unnamed student had confessed to the murder, in the presence of his father, independent witnesses, and a juvenile welfare officer. The CBI stated that the student had not been performing well academically, and had been unable to write a scheduled exam on the day of the murder. He was also was reported to have three more examinations and a parent-teacher meeting scheduled for that week. A statement from the CBI indicated that they believed the unnamed student killed Pradyuman to postpone his examinations and parent-teacher meetings at the school. A CBI official stated to press that the student \\"...believed that a sensational act would either force the school to shut down for a few days or create enough disruption to cancel the exams and the parent-teacher meeting.\\" The CBI has initially stated that they believe that the choice of victim was random. The unnamed student was quoted as later confirming to the Juvenile Justice Board that he knew Pradyuman as they attended the same music class. The unnamed student's father has subsequently accused the CBI of torturing his son in order to elicit a false confession. The investigation is still in progress.  Arrest of school authorities for negligence  Following the murder of Pradyuman Thakur, parents of several students filed a police complaint stating that the school had been negligent in maintaining security measures, and particularly pointed out a collapsed boundary wall that allowed access to school grounds, as well as several dysfunctional CCTVs on the school premises, resulting in the arrest of several school officials. A team of Haryana Police travelled to Mumbai to investigate the owners of Ryan International School. The founders of the Ryan Group of Schools, Augustine and Grace Pinto, and their son, Ryan Pinto, applied for and were denied anticipatory bail at the Bombay High Court, with Pradyuman Thakur's father filing an application to the court opposing their plea. They were also denied anticipatory bail from the Punjab and Haryana High Court. On appeal to the Supreme Court, senior officials and owners of the Ryan International School were granted a bail order, and the Supreme Court described the proceedings against them as a 'media trial'. Ryan International School management made a motion to the Supreme Court to transfer the case outside Haryana to ensure a fair trial. The court began hearing the case on 18 September 2017. The Central Board of Secondary Education investigated Ryan International School, and reported to the Supreme Court that school authorities had been negligent in maintaining safety and security conditions on the school premises. The CBSE further found that the school had failed to report the incident to the police when it occurred, and that the police had been contacted by the victim's family.  Trial  In order to determine how the trial would proceed, the Juvenile Justice Board set up a committee which included a psychologist from the Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS, Rohtak) for an expert opinion on the accused unnamed student. On 11 November 2017, the unnamed student was placed in a juvenile home for observation, following an order from a juvenile court in Gurugram. The Court had also appointed a welfare officer to act as a liasion for the unnamed student. After conducting evaluations on the unnamed student's mental and physical state, the JJB declared on 20 December 2017, that he would be treated as an adult and undergo a regular trial in court. The JJB noted that the student \\"...had the adequate ability to understand the consequences of his acts.\\" The Board had also ordered an investigation into the unnamed student's conduct, which found that his behavior in school had been \\"aggressive\\" although reports from neighbours contradicted this. The Board also heard an application from Pradyuman Thakur's family, asking that the unnamed student be tried as an adult. In accordance with the Juvenile Justice Act 2015, if found guilty, the unnamed student will be remanded to a correctional facility for youth where he will remain until the age of 21, after which he may be transferred to jail. He cannot be sentenced to life imprisonment or the death penalty.  Public Response  The news of Pradyuman's murder resulted in protests by parents at the Ryan International School and several people were subsequently arrested for vandalizing school property. Police officials responded with a baton charge on the protesters, and one police official was subsequently suspended in connection with this. Barun Thakur appealed for peace, publicly accused the school of being negligent regarding the safety of the students, and moved the Supreme Court of India for an investigation into the school, as well as for a transfer of the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation. A police force was deployed inside and around the school in response to the anxious parents who barged into the school and began throwing furniture as well as breaking glass awards cases. In response to these protests, the Chief Minister of Haryana, Manohar Lal Khattar, assured parents that strict action would be taken against the criminal. On 11 September 2017, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Central Government, the Haryana Government, and the Central Board of Secondary Education after the child's father, Varun Thakur, petitioned for a CBI probe into his son's murder and into the safety guidelines for children in school. Following this, two officials of the Ryan International School were arrested after an investigation pointed out serious security lapses. For example, most of the school's closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras were not working, and there was no CCTV camera in the area of the incident. Ryan International School principal was reinstated at another branch after a short suspension. Neerja Batra was placed as a teacher at a school in Gurugram's sector 40 by Deputy Commissioner, Vinay Pratap Singh. This relocation by the administration angered Thakur's parents who called the principal \\"irresponsible\\". Since Batra revealed the insufficient security, and had no financial resources to deal with the situation herself, she was deemed not responsible for the murder of the young child. Due to the incident, many students have come forward with stories of violence conducted by their teachers and principal. As a result, many measures have been taken by the Ryan Group, such as: metal detectors in school, female security guards, bathrooms not being open between school periods, and parents not being allowed to enter the school during school hours.  Policies Regarding School Safety  Following the murder of Pradyuman Thakur, the Haryana government instituted a number of policies aimed at improving school safety. Mandatory police checks on school staff, including transport staff were instituted. The Ministry of Human Resources and Development announced an initiative to train school teachers to address mental health issues following the murder. In popular culture In 2018, director and screenwriter Vishal Bhardwaj stated that he would be making a film based on the murder of Pradyuman Thakur.

This summit occurred in light of the recent partially successful detonation of a nuclear device by North Korea, the development of which violated a range of guarantees, given in exchange for aid, that North Korea would cease nuclear weapon development. This summit probably occurred due to concerted political and economic pressure from a number of major states (such as the United States, South Korea, and Japan) and in particular from China, which is the nearest state North Korea has as an ally, and which provides North Korea with the oil and food supplies that keep the country from totally collapsing., CNN, accessed 2 October 2007  Details  On August 8, 2007, the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) announced that the second Inter-Korean summit would be held from August 28 to August 30, 2007.Korean leaders issue peace call , BBC, 4 October 2007, 9:27 GMT However, on August 18, 2007, North Korea postponed the talks due to flooding.

In 1927 the Burra Burri Provisional School was closed and on 16 May 1927 Washpool became a full-time state school. In 1957 Washpool State School was renamed Burra Burri State School. The school celebrated its centenary on 10 September 2016.  Education  Burra Burri State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 3173 Burra Burri Creek Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 9 students with 4 teachers (2 full-time equivalent) and 5 non-teaching staff (2 full-time equivalent). There is no secondary school in Burra Burri. The nearest secondary schools are in Jandowae (up to Year 10) or Chinchilla (up to Year 12).  Community groups  The Burra Burri branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at the Burra Burri Hall on the corner of Burra Burri Darr Creek Road and Burra Burri Creek Road ().

All four sister ships were requisitioned when Italy joined the war in 1915. Originally named Vijelie by the Romanians, she was renamed Sparviero in Italian service. Not completed until mid-1917, the ship engaged Austro-Hungarian ships in the Adriatic Sea only twice before the war ended in November 1918. She was given a new name as MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti when she was re-purchased by the Romanians in 1920. After the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 (Operation Barbarossa), MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti took part in the Raid on Constan»õa a few days later and may have damaged a Soviet destroyer leader during the battle. The powerful Soviet Black Sea Fleet heavily outnumbered Axis naval forces in the Black Sea and the Romanian destroyers were limited to escort duties in the western half of the Black Sea during the war. In early 1944 the Soviets were able to cut off and surround the port of Sevastopol on the Crimean Peninsula; during this time the ship escorted convoys evacuating Axis troops from the port before she ran aground in April. MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti saw no further action as she was being repaired. Later that year Romania switched sides, but despite that the Soviets seized the Romanian ships and incorporated them into the Soviet Navy. Renamed Lovkiy, the ship only served for a year before she was returned to the Romanians who redesignated her as D12 in 1952. The ship was discarded in 1961 and subsequently scrapped. Design and description Plan and right elevation line drawing of the Aquila-class scout cruisers The Vifor-class destroyers were ordered in 1913 by Romania from the Pattison Shipyard in Italy, as part of the 1912 Naval Program. They were to be armed with three guns, four guns, five torpedo tubes and have a 10-hour endurance at full speed. Three ships had been laid down by the time Italy joined the Allied side in World War I on 23 May 1915 by declaring war on the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Italians requisitioned the Romanian ships on 5 June, redesignating them as Aquila-class scout cruisers (esploratori). By this time Vijelie approximately 50 percent complete and was renamed Sparviero.Twardowski, p. 421Fraccaroli, p. 266 The ships had an overall length of , had a beam of , and a draft of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. Their crew numbered 9 officers and 137 sailors. The ships were powered by two Tosi steam turbines, each driving a single propeller, using steam provided by five Thornycroft boilers. The turbines were designed to produce for a speed of , although Sparviero reached during her sea trials from . The scouts carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at a speed of . The Italians initially intended to arm the ships with seven 120 mm guns and two pairs of twin mounts for 45 cm torpedo tubes, but they changed the gun armament to three and four 76 mm weapons to outgun their nearest Austro-Hungarian equivalents, the Admiral Spaun and scout cruisers. Two of the 152 mm guns were mounted side-by-side on the forecastle and the third gun was mounted on the aft superstructure. The 76 mm anti-aircraft (AA) guns were positioned two on each broadside. The torpedo mounts were abreast the middle funnel, one on each broadside. Sparviero could carry 44 mines. Construction and service Sparviero was laid down on 29 January 1914 by Pattison in its Naples shipyard. She was launched on 25 March 1917 and commissioned on 15 July 1917. On the night of 29/30 September, the ship led seven destroyers that put to sea to support an aerial bombardment of the Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola when they encountered a force of four Austro-Hungarian destroyers and four torpedo boats on a similar mission against an Italian airbase. The Italians opened fire just before midnight at a range of , but received the worst of the initial exchange as the Austro- Hungarians concentrated their fire on the leading ship. Sparviero was hit five times, but only three men were wounded, and one Italian destroyer was hit. As the Austro-Hungarians retreated towards the shelter of their minefields, the Italians crippled the destroyer and set her on fire. Another destroyer took her in tow and both sides returned to port after an inconclusive exchange of fire inside the minefields later that night. Profile view of Sparviero, 1918 Sparviero and her sister escorted a force of destroyers and smaller vessels as they bombarded Grisolera on 19 December. Sparviero, together with Aquila and their sister Nibbio, was protecting the recovery of a broken-down flying boat in the Gulf of Drin when they spotted three Austro-Hungarian torpedo boats sweeping mines on 5 September 1918. The sisters opened fire and damaged 86 F before the torpedo boats reached the shelter of Medua's coastal artillery. The following month, they escorted Allied ships as they bombarded Durazzo, Albania, on 2 October. The trio then covered the ships bombarding Medua, Albania, on 21 October.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2013, p. 208; Cernuschi & O'Hara 2016, pp. 67‚Äì69, 73 Sparviero and Nibbio were re-purchased by Romania in 1920. Sparviero became MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti and Nibbio was renamed MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti when they were commissioned after arriving in Romania on 1 July 1920. The ships were formally re-classified as destroyers and assigned to the newly formed Counter-torpedo Division () which was renamed as the Destroyer Squadron () on 1 April 1927. The sisters were sent to Italy in 1925‚Äì1926 for a refit where they had their 152 mm guns replaced by two twin-gun 120 mm Schneider-Canet-Armstrong 1918/19 turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure, and a fifth gun on a platform amidships. The aft 76 mm guns removed during this time.Whitley, p. 223 Fire-control systems were fitted the following year. The Squadron was visited by King Carol II of Romania and the Prime Minister, Nicolae Iorga, on 27 May 1931. By 1940, the midships 120 mm gun had been replaced by a pair of twin-gun French Hotchkiss anti-aircraft machinegun mounts and the remaining 76 mm guns by a pair of German SK C/30 AA guns. Depth charge racks had been fitted on the stern and an Italian depth charge thrower was added. The ships could carry 40 depth charges or 50 mines. These changes reduced the displacement of the sisters to at standard load and at deep load.Axworthy, pp. 348‚Äì349; Whitley, pp. 223‚Äì224 World War II MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti at sea, late 1930s A few days after the invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa) on 22 June 1941, a pair of destroyer leaders, and , began bombarding Constan»õa in the early hours of 26 June. The Romanians were expecting a Soviet raid and their defences, consisting of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti, the destroyer and the heavy guns of the German coastal artillery battery Tirpitz, were prepared to engage the Soviet ships. In ten minutes, starting from 03:58, Moskva and Kharkov fired no less than 350 shells from their guns. The two Romanian warships returned fire with their guns at distances between , but only knocked Moskvas mainmast down. The two Soviet ships were silhouetted against the dawn while the Romanian ships were hidden by the coast behind them. The heavy and accurate Axis fire caused Moskva and Kharkov to begin to withdraw while laying down a smoke screen. As they retreated they entered a Romanian minefield and Moskva sank after striking a mine.Axworthy, p. 331; Hervieux, pp. 70‚Äì71; Rohwer, pp. 82‚Äì83 Massively outnumbered by the Black Sea Fleet, the Romanian ships were kept behind the minefields defending Constan»õa for several months after the start of the war. They spent that time training for convoy escort operations. Beginning on 5 October, the Romanians began laying minefields to defend the route between the Bosphorus and Constan»õa; the minelayers were protected by the destroyers. After the evacuation of Odessa on 16 October, the Romanians began to clear the Soviet mines defending the port and to lay their own minefields protecting the route between Constan»õa and Odessa. During the winter of 1941‚Äì1942, the Romanian destroyers were primarily occupied with escorting convoys between the Bosporus and Constan»õa. On 1 December MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti, Regina Maria and her sister were escorting a convoy to Odessa when a submarine unsuccessfully attacked them. It was quickly spotted and depth charged by Regina Maria and Regele Ferdinand with the latter claiming a kill. Soviet records, however, do not acknowledge any losses on that date.Axworthy, pp. 332‚Äì334; Hervieux, pp. 75‚Äì76; Rohwer & Monakov, p. 265 MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti in splinter camouflage, 1943 On 20 April 1942, after the ice had melted, MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti, MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti and Regina Maria escorted the first convoy to Ochakov, although the Romanian destroyers were generally used to escort ships between the Bosporus and Constan»õa. After Sevastopol surrendered on 4 July, a direct route between the port and Constan»õa was opened in October and operated year-round.Axworthy, pp. 335, 337‚Äì338; Hervieux, pp. 76‚Äì77; Whitley, p. 224 MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti and MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti and two gunboats were escorting a convoy of three cargo ships on 7 July 1943 when they were attacked by a small wolfpack of three submarines. fired six torpedoes at one of the gunboats and a freighter and missed with all of them. MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti depth charged one of the submarines and claimed to have sunk it, but no submarines were lost by the Soviets that day.Hervieux, p. 81; Rohwer, p. 254 On the night of 9/10 November, the sisters escorted minelayers as they laid a minefield off Sevastopol.Hervieux, p. 81 At some point during the war, the ship's anti-aircraft armament was augmented with two additional 3.7 cm SK C/30 and four AA guns. Successful Soviet attacks in early 1944 cut the overland connection of the Crimea with the rest of Ukraine and necessitated its supply by sea. In early April another offensive occupied most of the peninsula and encircled Sevastopol. The Romanians began evacuating the city on 14 April, with their destroyers covering the troop convoys. MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti ran aground later that month and was under repair for the rest of the war.Hervieux, p. 82; Whitley, p. 224 After King Michael's Coup on 23 August, Romania declared war on the Axis Powers. MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti remained in harbour until she was seized by the Soviets on 5 September together with the rest of the Romanian Navy.Axworthy, p. 345; Hervieux, p. 88 Renamed Lovkiy on 20 October, the ship was commissioned into the Soviet Navy as part of the Black Sea Fleet, along with her sister, on 14 September.Berezhnoy, p. 13 They were returned to Romania on 12 October 1945Rohwer & Monakov, p. 268 where they resumed their former names. The sisters were then assigned to the Destroyer Squadron before beginning an overhaul. When the Destroyer Division was redesignated as the 418th Destroyer Division in 1952, MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti was renamed D12. The ship continued to serve until April 1961, when she was discarded and subsequently scrapped.

Informally, it is a bijection between the respective sets of solutions of two problems. A general reduction from problem A to problem B is a transformation that guarantees that whenever A has a solution B also has at least one solution and vice versa. A parsimonious reduction guarantees that for every solution of A, there exists a unique solution of B and vice versa. Parsimonious reductions are defined for problems in nondeterministic complexity classes such as NP, which contains problems whose candidate solutions can be verified by a polynomial time deterministic Turing machine.  Formal definition  Let x be an instance of problem X. A Parsimonious reduction R from problem X to problem Y is a reduction such that the number of solutions to x is equal to the number of solutions to problem R(x). If such a reduction exists, and if we have an oracle that counts the number of solutions to R(x) which is an instance of Y, then we can design an algorithm that counts the number of solutions to x, the corresponding instance of X. Consequently, if counting the number of solutions to the instances of X is hard, then counting the number of solutions to Y must be hard as well.  Applications  Just as many-one reductions are important for proving NP- completeness, parsimonious reductions are important for proving completeness for counting complexity classes such as ‚ôØP. Because parsimonious reductions preserve the property of having a unique solution, they are also used in game complexity, to show the hardness of puzzles such as sudoku where the uniqueness of the solution is an important part of the definition of the puzzle. Specific types of parsimonious reductions may be defined by the computational complexity or other properties of the transformation algorithm. For instance, a polynomial-time parsimonious reduction is one in which the transformation algorithm takes polynomial time. These are the types of reduction used to prove ‚ôØP-completeness. In parameterized complexity, FPT parsimonious reductions are used; these are parsimonious reductions whose transformation is a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm and that map bounded parameter values to bounded parameter values by a computable function. Polynomial-time parsimonious reductions are a special case of a more general class of reductions for counting problems, the polynomial-time counting reductions.. See in particular pp. 634‚Äì635. One common technique used in proving that a reduction R is parsimonious is to show that there is a bijection between the set of solutions to x and the set of solutions to R(x) which guarantees that the number of solutions to both problems is the same.  Examples of parsimonious reduction in proving #P-completeness  The class #P contains the counting versions of NP decision problems. Given an instance x of an NP decision problem X, the problem \\\\\\\\#x asks for the number of solutions to problem x. The examples of #P-completeness below rely on the fact that #SAT is #P-complete.  #3SAT  This is the counting version of 3SAT. One can show that any boolean formula can be rewritten as a formula in 3-CNF form. Any valid assignment of a boolean formula is a valid assignment of the corresponding 3-CNF formula, and vice versa. Hence, this reduction preserves the number of satisfying assignments, and is a parsimonious reduction. Then, #SAT and #3SAT are counting equivalents, and #3SAT is #P-complete as well.  Planar #3SAT  This is the counting version of Planar 3SAT. The hardness reduction from 3SAT to Planar 3SAT given by Lichtenstein has the additional property that for every valid assignment of an instance of 3SAT, there is a unique valid assignment of the corresponding instance of Planar 3SAT, and vice versa. Hence the reduction is parsimonious, and consequently Planar #3SAT is #P-complete.  Hamiltonian Cycle  The counting version of this problem asks for the number of Hamiltonian cycles in a given directed graph. Seta Takahiro provided a reduction from 3SAT to this problem when restricted to planar directed max degree-3 graphs. The reduction provides a bijection between the solutions to an instance of 3SAT and the solutions to an instance of Hamiltonian Cycle in planar directed max degree-3 graphs. Hence the reduction is parsimonious and Hamiltonian Cycle in planar directed max degree-3 graphs is #P-complete. Consequently, the general version of Hamiltonian Cycle problem must be #P-complete as well.  Shakashaka  Shakashaka is an example of how parsimonious reduction could be used in showing hardness of logic puzzles. The decision version of this problem asks whether there is a solution to a given instance of the puzzle. The counting version asks for the number of distinct solutions to such a problem. The reduction from Planar 3SAT given by Demaine, Okamoto, Uehara and Uno also provides a bijection between the set of solutions to an instance of Planar 3SAT and the set of solutions to the corresponding instance of Shakashaka. Hence the reduction is parsimonious, and the counting version of Shakashaka is #P-complete.

This method allows at the most with two SELECT statements and the analysis of two strings to compute the shortest path between two vertices of a graph. For a graph that is oriented like a road graph, this technique requires the prior computation of two tables from structures constructed using the method of the contraction hierarchies. In the end, these two computed tables will have as many rows as nodes present within the graph. For each row (each node), a label will be calculated. A label is a string containing the distance information between the current node (the node of the row) and all the other nodes that can be reached with an ascending search on the relative multi-level structure. The advantage of these distances is that they all represent the shortest paths. So, for future queries, the search of a shortest path will start from the source on the first table and the destination on the second table, from which it will be search within the labels for the common nodes with the associated distance information.

It is known as one of the most common fungi spoilage moulds on cheese. It also grows on and spoils other foods such as meat products and fat-containing products like nuts and margarine. Cyclopiazonic acid and regulovasine A and B are the most important mycotoxins produced by P. commune. The fungus is the only known species to be able to produce both penitrem A and roquefortine. Although this species does not produce penicillin, it has shown to have anti- pathogenic activity. There are no known plant, animal or human diseases caused by P. commune. History and taxonomy The fungus species was first described by the American mycologist Dr. Charles Thom in 1910. Penicillium commune is considered an ancestral wild-type of the fungus species P. camemberti, a mould commonly used in the production of soft cheese. Both species are similar in their ability to produce cyclopiazonic acid, a metabolite not normally produced by members of the genus Penicillium. P. commune, by contrast, is a saprotroph that produces soft, fluffy cotton-like colonies. In their 1949 monograph of the genus, Raper and Thom treated P. commune and P. lanosum in subsection Lanata. P. commune (Thom) was included in the series along with . Since then, there has been two additional species added: P. echinosporum (Nehira) and P. giganteum (Roy and Singh). The species is presently treated in Penicillium subgenus Penicillium section Viridicata series Camemberti. Growth and morphology The asexually produced spores (i.e., conidia) of P. commune are smooth and spherical, ranging from 3.5 to 5.0 Œºm in diameter, borne in disordered chains on conidiophores with rough-walled stipes. The conidium-bearing stalks are either produced singularly or in bundled groups known as fascicles. The stalk lengths are usually 200 to 400 Œºm. Conidia are dull grey green or grey turquoise in colour. No known sexual reproduction has been described. Penicillium commune can be distinguished by its fast growth on creatine sucrose neutral agar (CSN) while showing a slow growth rate on malt extract agar (MEA) and restricted growth on Czapek medium (CZA) and Czapek yeast extract agar (CYA). The appearance of colonies on MEA ranges from soft, velvety and grown in unison to granular and barely grown together. The underside of colonies produced on MEA are pale-yellow coloured and sun-yellow coloured. Colonies on CZA and CYA range from soft and velvety to slightly fluffy with exudate present that can be clear to brown coloured. In addition, the underside of the colonies grown on CZA and CYA are creamy/ dull yellow to brown-yellow in colour. The production of purple pigment has also been observed. Physiology Like many other Penicillium species, P. commune is able to grow in temperatures resembling that of the refrigerator. However, the optimum temperature for the species is 25¬∞C while the maximum limit is 37¬∞C. The minimal water activities (aw) for germination and growth for P. commune is 0.83aw which is near the lower side for fungal growth as most fungal activity is inhibited at 0.70aw or less. The fungus species shows no sign of growth in environments consisting of 20% CO2 and less than 5% O2. Although, in the presence of 80% CO2 and 20% O2, there are signs of limited growth.P. commune expresses lipolytic activity. The main mycotoxins produced by P. commune are cyclopiazonic acid and regulovasine A and B. Other secondary metabolites produced include: cyclopenin, cyclopenol, dehydrocyclopeptin, cylcopeptin, viridicatol, viridicatin, cyclopaldic acid, cyclopolic acid. However, the mentioned metabolites above are produced with unknown toxicity and not all isolates of P. commune produce them, with cyclopaldic acid being the only exception. Two neurotoxins, penitrem A and roquefortine, are produced by P. commune culture obtained from cottonseed. Aside from P. roqueforti, P. commune is the only other Penicillium species known to produce roquefortine. The cottonseed study suggested that the neurotoxic effects of this species are minimal. This species does not cause disease in plants, animals or humans. Habitat and ecology Penicillium commune is found indoors and most commonly, on food products. The main habitat for the fungus is cheese, including both hard and soft cheese. With cheese being produced in an environment that is characterized by refrigeration temperatures, low oxygen availability, lipid breakdown activity, preservation actions of free fatty acids and reduced water availability, the physiology of P. commune allows the fungus to still grow in these conditions. Therefore, as it is known as one of the most successful spoilage moulds of cheese, it is also the main reason for their spoilage. In addition, the fungus is frequently found as a mould growing on dry-cured meat products as well. This species has been isolated from other food products such as nuts, fats, margarine, fermented sausages, yogurt, sour cream, lactose powder, and high fat-filling cakes. It has been known to cause \\"phenol defect\\" in foods like ripening Italian ham, apples, pears and flours where the taste and smell of these products are off due to spoilage by the fungus. Aside from colonizing on food products, the fungus of P. commune has also been isolated from disposed used oil. Industrial and medical applications Penicillium commune has shown promising activity in microbial biodegradation research in relation to environmental pollutants. A 2014 study identified the potential of this species to biodegrade industrial oil waste. Although the rate of bio-removing oil was dependent on volume of oil, pH level of culture and co-culture incubation period, optimal conditions resulted in a 95.4% removal rate of oil waste by P. commune. The fungus could be a new source in industrial application with respect to biodegradation of oil wastes in the environment using biological means. Although P. commune has no known penicillin activity, an environmental isolate of the fungus has shown to produce statin and to anti-pathogenic products. The fungus species was able to significantly decrease the growth of two pathogenic bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, on biofilms in a laboratory setting. In addition, there has been evidence of the production of lovastatin from the environmental isolate of P. commune.

Ruling over Batlokwa, while Queen Manthatisi settled in Marabeng, Sekonyela settled in Jwala-Boholo. As a minor, Sekonyela could not take over the reins, only when he came of age could he lead Batlokwa. He worked closely with the Korana (also known as Khoemana) during his raids on neighbouring kingdoms, often conflicting with King Moshoeshoe I. Kgosi Sekonyela is regarded as the last ruler of the Tlokwa Chiefdom during the struggle of sovereignty over northern Lesotho. Early life Sekonyela was the son of Kgosi Mokotjo of the Batlokwa people who married Monyalue of the Basia, who then became Manthatisi after the birth of their first child ‚Äì Nthatisi. Mokotjo died following an illness while on a mission to claim the area around Hohobeng from the rival Batlokwa chief Lebasa. Mokotjo contracted a disease, died, and his body was sent back to Nkwe for burial. Manthatisi continued relations with the Basia, conferring with Basia advisors and sending her son to be raised in her brother's, Basia home. At the time of Mokotjo's death, Sekonyela was only nine years old and it would be another ten years before he was old enough to rule. The same thing had happened to Mokotjo's mother Ntlo-Kholo who had married Montueli. When Montueli passed away, Ntlo-Kholo assumed the reigns until Mokotjo came of age. When Manthatisi became regent, she sent Sekonyela to live with her people ‚Äì the Basia ‚Äì in order to protect him from political rivalry. He even attended circumcision school with the Basia people, assisted by his uncle Letlala, at the absence of his own father. Sekonyela leads Batlokwa Sekonyela re- joined the tribe around 1824 after Manthatisi had led them through the first phase of the Sotho wars and effectively took over from his mother. One of his major challenges was encounters with the European missionaries in the 1830s. While some black kingdoms were friendly towards the missionaries, others were hostile. Sekonyela was one of the rulers who did not see eye-to-eye with the missionaries. In addition, another European group ‚Äì the Voortrekker came into contact with the Batlokwa; moving from the Cape into the interior. Seeking land and livestock, in some instances they negotiated their way into black communities, in other instances dislodging them. This caused major conflicts. In 1830, Sekonyela and his people settled near the Mohokare (Caledon) River, where his major rival became King Moshoeshoe I. They rivaled over control for Northern Lesotho. For twenty years, the two rivals raided each other and competed for adherents from the many refugee bands in the region. In 1836, Batlokwa were attacked by Korana raiders. Sekonyela was impressed by their skills, which included horse riding and shooting, and requested them to impart those skills on to his people. Their relations did not last long, as soon disputes led the Korana out, who relocated to Koranaberg (Excelsior and Marquard). This was after taking off with most of the cattle of Batlokwa. Sekonyela then relocated across the Caledon River. A year later there were encounters again with the Korana, which led Batlokwa deep into the Maluti Mountains and his cattle were once again looted. In 1837, Sekonyela was imprisoned by Piet Retief by trickery. Retief wanted him to take the fall for Dingane's stolen cattle and further demanded 700 cattle, 70 horses and 30 muskets for his release. Sekonyela obliged and was freed. Retief decided not to surrender Sekonyela to Dingane, who had initially asked for 300 cows. The rest, Retief took for himself. He also confiscated guns from the Batlokwa, which Sekonyela had obtained through a bartering system. Retief decided to put the blame on Sekonyela so that he could negotiate a Voortrekker settlement in Dingane's area. This however did not work in Retief's favour as Dingane went ahead and executed him and his entourage. In May 1849, Sekonyela and the Korana, particularly their leader Gert Taaibosch (who was also famous as a horseman and warrior), were reconciled and this is when a number of attacks against Moshoeshoe I were carried out. In the past, the Korana and Moshoeshoe I had disputes over land, particularly land near the Caledon River. On 1 September 1850, Major HD Warden - who was in charge of the Orange Free State, after it was annexed by the British in 1848 ‚Äì was granted permission by the Orange Free State government to take military action against Sekonyela in order to end the frequent attacks on the Basotho and Bataung. This was after Moshoeshoe I and Bataung had complained about the frequent raids by Sekonyela. This was however not realised due to mediation from Taiibosch. Sekonyela paid a fine of 300 cows after showing remorse. Defeat and death After the Battle of Berea on 20 December 1852, Taaibosch and Sekonyela attacked Bataung of Tolo in Winburg and the Kgolokwe under Witsie in the Harrismith District. In the battle of Khoro-e-Betloa against the Batlokwa by Basotho, which ensued towards the end of 1853 (between October and November), Taaibosch was killed at Dawidsberg. After the death of Taaibosch, the army of Moshoeshoe I overwhelmed the Tlokwa and drove Sekonyela out of Jwalaboholo, his forte. Following that defeat, Sekonyela fled to Winburg with very few of his people. The bulk of his people joined Moshoeshoe I; and others relocated to the Eastern Cape with a small portion fleeing north to integrate with Batswana. He later moved to a plot given by a white man ‚Äì George Clerk ‚Äì at Wittenberg Reserve in the Herschel District of Eastern Cape. He died on 20 July 1856.

Primarily produced by Hamilton, the album has received positive reviews and has since gained a cult following. Background In August 2008, Charles Hamilton announced via interview that he had signed to Interscope Records. After beginning a series of mixtapes known as the Hamiltonization Process, Hamilton released his debut single \\"Brooklyn Girls\\" on November 11, 2008, which proved to be a hit. Hamilton was rumored to be recording his major-label debut was under pressure from the label to include \\"Brooklyn Girls\\" on the album. He later disagreed with this idea and chose to release his debut effort independently. The album did not include new material and was actually recorded during Hamilton's notorious bout of homelessness in the recording studio of the Frederick Douglass Academy in Harlem, New York, which Charles and other members of Demevolist Music Group dubbed \\"The Lab\\". Music & Lyrics The Pink Lavalamp is an introspective, loose concept album detailing Hamilton's thoughts and emotions leading up to an attempted suicide. The production is rooted in soulful samples mixed with down-tempo grooves and draw influence from jazz, psychedelic funk, R&B;, and rock. Lyrically, the album concerns themes of depression, substance abuse, infidelity, and individuality. On the track \\"I'll Be Around (Outro)\\", Hamilton raps, \\"I'm a dropout, a junkie and a drunk, honestly is that the kind of company you want around your son?/That's why I run/That's why I numb/That's why I'm such a fuckin' punk\\", addressing his drug addiction and anxieties. As evidenced in the content, it was the final project in the Hamiltonization Process. Critical Reception Despite its low mainstream coverage at the time of its release, ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Pink Lavalamp‚Äô‚Äô has over time continued to receive rave reviews, both from the hip hop community as well as music critics.

History  The history of the Cranbourne FC dates back to as far back as the 1890s after its 1889 foundation and was a founding club of the newly-formed Berwick District Football Association in 1910. Despite the ongoing wars in the 1910s and from 1939 to 1945, the club remained in the competition, which changed its name to the Dandenong District Football Association, until 1953 when it relocated to the South West Gippsland Football League as an inaugural member. Cranbourne struggled in its first few years of competition in the SWGFL but managed to claim its first senior flag in the new competition in 1966 but the 1980s was to be the Eagles' best era, winning seven flags from 1985 to 1993. The SWGFL was absorbed by the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League in 1995, just eight years after the merger of the two leagues. Cranbourne saw success early in the MPNFL's Northern division by beating Karingal by 8 points in the Grand Final. They began competing in the Casey Cardinia division of the league and contested in four consecutive grand finals from 2011 to 2014, but 2011 was the only year the Eagles came out victorious. 2015 saw the nine clubs competing in the Casey Cardinia division leave the MPNFL to start the South East Football Netball League. Cranbourne made the inaugural SEFNL grand final only to lose to Berwick but came back to beat the Wickers in 2016 15.9.99 to 9.11.65.

It consists of an Early Childhood department (Parent & Me through Pre-1st grade), an Elementary division (Grades 1-5) and a Middle School division (Grades 6-8). Hillel offers a comprehensive Judaic and General Studies program and is accredited by the California Association of Independent Schools (CAIS) and the Builders of Jewish Education. In 1993-1994, the school received the National Blue Ribbon Award for Excellence in Education from the United States Department of Education. Hillel was recognized as an Apple Distinguished School for 2016-2018.  History  In 1948, the school was founded by Rabbi Dr. Simon A. Dolgin as part of Beth Jacob Congregation and began with an enrollment of 37 students. In 1961, Rabbi Menachem Gottesman assumed the leadership of the school, which was located at that time in the basement of Beth Jacob. In 1964, the school moved to its current location one block from Beth Jacob. By 1988, the school had expanded its campus to include its original building and the adjacent property. Rabbi Gottesman led the school until 2003 at which time Rabbi Y. Boruch Sufrin began his tenure as the Head of School. In 2014, Rabbi Sufrin received the Covenant Foundation award for Excellence in Jewish Education.  Community  Hillel's philosophy is to imbue its students and parents with a strong sense of community and belonging. Through a variety of extracurricular programming such as intergenerational learning, Tikkun olam, chessed activities and social events, Hillel families and alumni are engaged in ongoing involvement with the school.  Israel and Zionism  Israel and Zionism are central tenets of Hillel's philosophy. Hillel's partners with Israel's National Service Organization and hosts four Sherut Leumi volunteers annually to integrate Israeli culture into Hillel's curriculum. Several Israeli educators engage in teaching Hebrew language Immersion programs beginning in Early Childhood, and regular use of Hebrew is integrated throughout the school. In addition, Hillel collaborates with The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles and the Zeitlin School Tel Aviv, through the L.A. Tel-Aviv Twinning program to host Israeli students each year and ensure that as part of the exchange, all Hillel eighth graders participate in an Israel trip experience as the culmination of their eighth grade year.  21st Century Learning  At Harkham Hillel Hebrew Academy, technology is integrated into the fabric of student learning and experiences. Technology goes beyond a class, a time, or a place; rather, it is a tool to solve a problem or challenge, a path towards innovation. Technology use at Hillel is intentional, purposeful, and geared towards making learning engaging and meaningful. In 2016 Apple announced that Hillel received the Apple Distinguished School award for successful implementation of its one-to-one Individualized Technology Initiative.

Plot Northern China in 1642, after almost 300 years, the Ming dynasty is on the verge of collapse. Li Zicheng's rebel forces have surrounded Kaifeng, capital of Henan province, but their attack on the city is temporarily beaten back. The persecuted Field Marshal Sun Chuanting (Leon Dai) is released from prison and summoned by the Chongzhen Emperor (Yu Shaoqun), and given 5,000 troops to put down the rebellion. Sun arrives in Tongguan with his wife (Feng Bo) and child, and is greeted by the corrupt garrison commander He Renlong, who does not know that Sun has come to execute him and his men for abandoning their posts. Itinerant physician Wu Youke (Feng Yuanzheng) is tried at a county magistrate for allegedly poisoning a patient with his unconventional treatment; the case is dismissed but the judge bans him from practising in his jurisdiction. On his way to Tongguan to visit his teacher, Wu is forced by Ming troops to attend to the wounds of Li Tianyou (Sun Qiang), a disillusioned scholar who was actually en route to joining the rebels. He then stays with his teacher, Master Physician Zhao Chuan (Qian Xuege), who is told to treat the Ming soldiers when more and more of them mysteriously start falling ill, but Master Zhao is unable to stop the spread of the epidemic among the soldiers and later dies of the plague himself. When all the other physicians flee in fear, an understanding develops between Wu and the Field Marshal Sun, who allows Wu to test out his unconventional medical theories of airborne disease. Wu isolates the sick in dedicated camps and orders everyone in contact to cover their face, and manages to contain the plague for the moment. The rebels hear of the success and attempt to kidnap Wu to treat their troops, but Field Marshal Sun's troops rescue him. Meanwhile, Field Marshal Sun finds that Tongguan's grain supplies are seriously low and the grain bags are filled with sand instead, so he angrily executes the registrar for covering up the fact. The local garrison is poorly trained, and the firearm equipments are malfunctional due to lack of maintenance. The besieged Ming troops in Kaifeng are now starving, and the Ming court is sending urgent orders telling Sun to attack the rebels. Sun however is having great trouble procuring rations and funds from the local gentries, who selfishly refuse to contribute anything for the army. When Sun attempts to confiscate public lands stolen from the local garrison by the gentries, they bribe his deputy Ren Qi (Hu Xiaoguang) to burn down the government archive storing the evidence. In fury and desperation, Sun summarily executes all the gentries in a surprise move and seized their assets by force. Under pressure from the emperor, Field Marshall sets out to engage the rebels. The night before he leaves, he arranges for the isolation camp to be burned and kills all within, so that the sick will not hinder his campaign. Disillusioned with the government, Wu Youke leaves with Master Zhao's widowed daughter and grandson and goes back to his hometown in Suzhou. He then spends the rest of his life compiling his knowledge and experiences treating the plague into the book On Plague Diseases, the theory of which regarding infectious diseases is two centuries ahead of its time. With an underprepared army, Field Marshall Sun is defeated and killed in the subsequent battle outside Tongguan. After his death, Li Zicheng's forces successfully invades Guanzhong and establishes the Shun dynasty at Xi'an, and the Ming dynasty collapses two years later.

City administration In the 2010 local elections, he ran as a deputy mayoral candidate with Nur Mahmudi Ismail, who had been mayor of Depok in the 2006-2011 term as the first directly-elected regional leader in Indonesia. The couple won the election, and during their five-year tenure the city's government received several awards from the central government on sanitation, health and child-friendliness. In the 2015 elections, with Ismail being constitutionally prohibited from getting his third term, Idris ran with Great Indonesia Movement Party politician Pradi Supriatna. The couple secured 411,367 votes (59.4%) and defeated a PDIP- supported pair.

His father, Michael Lamar White III, was in prison at the time of his birth, and his mother, Tonya White, was left to raise him as a single parent. White has a younger brother nicknamed \\"Hippie Redd\\" and had an older brother who made music under the name \\"Dirty Redd\\". Dirty Redd was killed in a car accident in 2014, White talked to Rolling Stone about the time following the fatal accident. White grew up in Canton, though he moved to Columbus, Ohio, several times.

White began taking his music career seriously and began recording music, releasing \\"Sub- Zero\\" and \\"New Ferrari\\" in 2014 but soon deleting those songs. Following his high school graduation, White moved to Atlanta, where he met rapper Lil Wop and was eventually offered a deal with a record label.

Feuds 6ix9ine On April 13, 2017, 6ix9ine featured on White's song \\"Poles1469\\" and in July 2017, he was also featured on White's song \\"Owee\\". Following a post from a Twitter account claiming 6ix9ine was a pedophile, White denounced 6ix9ine, saying, \\"I'm sorry brozay, 1400 don't promote pedophiles... If we give niggas clout, we give niggas clout. It was an accident.\\" On November 11, 2017, White was attacked in a New York hotel and claimed that a member of 6ix9ine's team ambushed him. 6ix9ine later insinuated his involvement, saying \\"I don't know what's going on, but your chin is bruised up. You can't just be out here calling people gay, bro. Can't be supporting false accusations, you can't be ranting on Live talking about New York. Fuck [what] these niggas talking about, New York this, New York that, like, you just can't do that bro. You should put some ice on that chin, it's bruised up. I feel bad bro... I just want you to be my friend again,\\" before singing a hook from \\"Poles1469\\". In February 2018, 6ix9ine was assaulted by several men outside of a Los Angeles airport shortly after arguing with White on Instagram. 6ix9ine and White continued to trade insults over social media in February 2018 and March 2018. In May 2018, 6ix9ine started a feud with rapper Tadoe and Chief Keef over allegations that Tadoe had abused artist Cuban Doll for talking to 6ix9ine. White supported Tadoe in the feud and went on to release a diss track toward 6ix9ine, \\"I Kill People\\", featuring Tadoe and Chief Keef. 6ix9ine also accused White of having sexual relations with fellow rapper Danielle Bregoli, also known as Bhad Bhabie, who is a minor. White and Bregoli denied the accusation, but the latter admitted that the two had kissed in the past: \\"We kissed but it wasn't that serious and he was 17 at the time.\\" On September 17, 2019, 6ix9ine has stated in a testimony that White has been involved with the Five Nine Brims gang. XXXTentacion In October 2017, a preview of Drake's song \\"God's Plan\\" was shown on social media. The song originally featured White singing the hook and giving an additional verse. Florida rapper Jahseh Onfroy, known by his stage name XXXTentacion, who had prior issues with Drake, began to associate with 6ix9ine, to White's chagrin. In March 2018, Onfroy \\"banned\\" White from Florida, promising to assault him if he attempted to enter the state. Onfroy apologized to White during a performance later that month, and the two reconciled after White accepted his apology. White and Onfroy went on to collaborate on multiple occasions. Following XXXTentacion's death on June 18, 2018, White dyed his hair in memory of the artist and released \\"Ghost Busters\\", a collaboration with Quavo, XXXTentacion and Ski Mask the Slump God in memoriam. Personal life White has stated he is of Irish, Native American and African American descent. White said in March 2017 that he was worth $7 million and purchased his mother a $300,000 home. Legal issues White was arrested in Cobb County, Georgia following an assault on rapper FDM Grady in late May 2018. According to Grady, White and rapper Lil Wop insulted Grady's girlfriend, leading Grady to draw a firearm briefly before engaging in a fist fight with White. At that point, Grady was attacked by four men including White and Wop. White was arrested on charges of affray (public fighting), criminal trespass and simple battery. A few weeks later in early June, White was again arrested in Georgia on an assault charge for allegedly pistol-whipping a woman. Discography * Life's a Trip (2018) * !

The film was released on December 21, 2018 by Saban Films, Rise Up and Voltage Pictures. Filming began at the end of August 2017. It was shot in Sweden and Alabama. According to director Maria Pulera, she initially wrote the film as a standard thriller, but later made it \\"a much more surreal drama in the vein of David Lynch\\". Plot The story follows Joe, (Cage), a down-on-his-luck truck driver haunted by the memory of his deceased wife and child. He meets Julie (Potente), a spiritually gifted woman who enlists Joe in a desperate effort to find the lost soul of her comatose daughter, Billie (Mitchell). But the spirit of Joe's dead wife Mary proves stronger, possessing the young woman's body while intending to settle her unfinished business with the living.

The film received a standing ovation during its premiere in Texas. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 29% IMDb gives it 4.6 out of 10 Birth.Movies.Death.'s Leigh Monson wrote that: \\"Between Worlds is a weird-ass movie\\" and defining Cage's role: \\"[...] a fascinating character to watch so that by the time the real insane shenanigans start up, they feel right in line with the foundation that Cage laid without losing their shock value\\". Heather Wixson from Daily Dead gave to the film a score of 3/5, calling it:\\"[...] a beautifully bizarre experience that I really admired, and I‚Äôm excited to see where Pulera‚Äôs career goes from here\\". She also praised the cast, writing that \\"Cage, Potente, and Mitchell deliver a trio of striking performances that really add so much to the material [...]\\". Ron Wilkinson from It's Just Movies appreciated the film and gave to it a rating of 7 on 10, writing that:\\"[...]it [Between Worlds] tells the story straight and makes use of genuine acting and plot instead of plugging in buckets of blood, sound crashes, fist fights and car chases to take up screen time\\", while Ain't it cool, in his good review, noted as: \\"[...] this is a movie that warns things happen for a reason, and you can‚Äôt control the order of the universe without devastating consequences\\". Alexandra Heller-Nicholas from Alliance of Women Film Journalists wrote that: \\"Between Worlds is shrewdly cast and crackles with electric dialogue which its performers clearly relish. Between Worlds takes an outrageous premise and plays it comparatively straight, but its flagrant brandishing David Lynch collaborator Angelo Badalamenti‚Äôs soundtrack perhaps over-signifies the precise kind of ‚Äòweird‚Äô terrain Pulera is seeking to tap into\\" and also appreciated the opening credit sequence and Thomas Hencz's cinematography. The film gained good reviews from sites like Vanyaland, Ghastly Grinning, Nightmarish Conjurings and Cryptic Rock. The first site compared it to Twin Peaks. Other international articles expressed approval of Nicolas Cage's performance for engaging in a very risque on-screen romp with actress Franka Potente and calling it his raciest performance of his career. Other reviewers were not as complimentary. Cinemalogue's Todd Jorgenson wrote that: \\"There are a few moments of inspired lunacy, but for the most part, it's sluggish and tedious\\". Also the European critic reacted with mixed reviews, praising Cage's acting but criticising Pulera's direction.

Rhodes took the leading roles and for years was their prima donna, scoring success every- where and winning applause in nearly every State in the Union. In 1890 the constant strain of daily singing and the weariness of incessant travel brought on a severe attack of nervous prostration, from which she made a very tardy recovery. Although thus compelled to abandon the stage for a time, she was not idle, but was busily engaged in vocal teaching and in special solo work in the various Chautauqua assemblies of the Northwest. Personal life Soon after starting her stage career, Laura Andrews married F. B. Rhodes, a druggist, who, at one of their entertainments, became enamored of her voice and speedily thereafter of herself. They were married within six months after the first meeting. Since their marriage F.B. Rhodes was connected with the opera company from time to time as business manager. She died on February 5, 1909, in Sisseton, South Dakota, and is buried at St. Peter, Minnesota.

The Manor of Upton itself dates back to the Domesday Book in 1086, when it was recorded as being held by William Mallbank. \\"The title of Lord of the Manor of Upton passed from Mallbank to the Praers and Ornebias, one of whom in 1230 gave it, and the Manor of Willaston, to his mother.

Retrieved 15 October 2017. Ownership of the hall and associated titles and privileges changed frequently. After six generations of occupation by the Bolds, it was purchased by Robert Davies in 1614. The currently standing Upton Hall, built by the Webster family in the 1800s, is a Grade II listed building. The Websters From ca. 1798 to 1861 the hall was owned by the Webster family, formerly farmers from Poulton-cum-Seacombe. John Webster bought Upton manor house, Upton Hall and title \\"Lord of the Manor\\". He was subsequently known \\"Squire\\". His son William was a philanthropist and was widely popular. William Webster took on patronage of the curacy of Woodchurch and erected a school. William married Elizabeth Matthews, ca. 1845, but she died sometime before 1861. The census of that year shows William married to Sophia Elizabeth Curme. William eldest son, John Egerton Webster, was not well liked.

The newspaper accounts of her testimony paint him as violent and brutal. The Webster family sold Upton Hall in 1862, possibly to pay John Egerton's debts or possibly because the ongoing scandal had negatively impacted their social standing. John Egerton petitioned to be made bankrupt (and relieved of the burden of repaying his debts), but this was declined by the courts on appeal. He is shown by the 1871 census to be an inmate of a poor house in Norwich, England. The clergyman and malacologist William Henry Webster was born at Upton Hall in 1850. The Websters rented the hall to William Inman in 1854, while he built his own house nearby. Faithful Companions of Jesus Nuns from the Society of the Faithful Companions of Jesus (FCJ) bought Upton Hall from the Websters in December 1862 and turned it into a boarding school for girls.

Davis (March 25, 1835 - April 19, 1927) was an American author, lecturer, editor, and mental scientist. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, she was the author of Marion Lester, 1850; Clinton Forest, 1858; Rosalie, 1865; and Ideal Motherhood, 1899. She was also a frequent contributor to the Christian Freeman and the Trumpet, as well as serving as associate editor of the Ladies' Repository. Davis was an invalid for many years, and was healed in 1885, attributing her recovery to \\"mental science\\", a philosophy of healing later known as the New Thought Movement. From 1885, she was in Hartford, Connecticut, devoting her time to healing, writing, and lecturing on metaphysical subjects. Early years and education Minnie Skinner Davis was born in Baltimore, March 25, 1835. Her parents, Rev. Samuel A. and Mary Partridge Davis, were natives of Vermont, but moved to Baltimore soon after their marriage. In that city, Rev. Davis was one of the earlier Universalist ministers. Rosalie When about six years of age, Davis was thrown from a carriage and one of the wheels passed across her back. The shock of that accident was afterwards assumed to be the cause of frequent illness and great delicacy of health. These circumstances kept the child by the mother's side, and the close companionship had a marked influence upon her future life. When Davis was about seven years old, the family removed to the State of Massachusetts, where the father became successively pastor of the parishes in Hingham, Quincy, and Sterling. About this time, there was a revival in the community, and Davis began to realize that other denominations preached very different doctrines than those taught by her father. In her girlhood, Davis became adept in storytelling. Her younger sisters found it to be their favorite pastime hearing Davis \\"tell stories.\\" One of these, Rosalie, which was published in 1859, was written by an amanuensis when Davis was too feeble to hold a pen, and in later years, it gave solace to Davis to review the story of her childhood. Davis' school days were often interrupted by weeks of illness or suffering from weak eyes, but she was able to catch up with her studies. The mother was her constant teacher; it was from her she learned an abhorrence of slavery and intemperance. But the mother died in 1848, when Davis, the eldest, was only 13 years old, and the youngest, Florence, an infant of three months. At the age of 17, Davis entered the Green Mountain Institute, Woodstock, Vermont. From the first, she excelled as a scholar and a writer, and frequently wrote short poems. Career Marion Lester Davis' favorite topic was the world of child-life. She had nearly completed a work which was afterward published under the title of Clinton Forest; or, The Harvest of Love. It treats of child-life, home influence, school scenes, the power of kindness in the treatment of children, the wanderings and trials of the child, the joys and sorrows of life. She did not dare to publish it, or hardly show it to her friends to get their opinion of it. In due time, she completed another manuscript, Marion Lester; or, The Mother's Mistake. The mistake of the mother consisted in sending her daughter to the school where religious error required a severe form of discipline. The plot was entirely Davis'. Some of the characters were taken from real life and some were drawn from the imagination. She prepared it for the press, and in May, 1856, sent it forth. It was a success. The book was read with intense interest by thousands. Three years later, Clinton Forest was finally published, and also had a large sale. In 1865, she published Rosalie. She had been a frequent contributor to the \\"Trumpet,\\" \\"Christian Freeman\\" and local papers, and a regular contributor to the \\"Ladies' Repository.\\" Of the last, Davis was for five years associate editor with Mrs. Sawyer and Mrs. Soul√©. Wearisome days prolonged into years ‚Äîmonths when she could not stand alone or walk‚Äî and then nursed into convalescence. All one long, dreary winter she was kept in a darkened room with her eyes closely covered, not enduring a ray of light, and suffering most intensely. And with all this pain and suffering and blindness, with it all there came such a longing to write one long poem. In 1863, she removed with her father's family to Hartford, Connecticut. A few months after going into her new home, she fell down stairs, and that was the beginning of long years of helplessness, suffering and partial blindness. All known means for her restoration had been tried, but with only partial and temporary success. In 1885, when the wave of \\"Mental Healing\\" swept over the U.S., Davis was one of the first who embraced its philosophy. A friend visited her and offered to treat her according to the new method of healing. In four months, the days of pain and the darkened room were over. She then obtained the best teachers and studied with them the philosophy of healing, and went out in her turn to pass on the work, in which she has had unusual success. Teaching was evidently her forte, her lectures being clear, strong and logical. Davis was interested in all the advanced movements of the day, including the temperance movement and equal rights. In 1869, her sister Florence died at the age of 19. At this time a group of young sisters was growing up around her ‚Äîthe children of her father's second marriage. Davis took the greatest interest in their education. She became their home instructor, and sought to form their taste in reading. When her suffering confined her to a darkened room, they became her readers and amanuenses. Davis died April 19, 1927, and was buried at Cedar Hill Cemetery, Hartford, Connecticut. Reviews Ideal Motherhood (T. Y. Crowell & Co., New York and Boston) was reviewed by The Arena who stated, to read Ideal Motherhood means an upliftment of soul, a keener appreciation of woman's highest privilege. While presenting an ideal, the author does not carry it beyond the pale of the practical; she believes in the necessity of combining the masculine and feminine elements, the developed intellect and intuition, as commensurate factors in shaping the young life. The review in The School Journal goes on to say, that Davis makes some very practical suggestions regarding motherhood, the responsibility entailed thereby, and the necessity for careful and thoughtful preparation for the duties encumbent upon parents. Living Counterparts ; a Study of Vibration (1903, Alliance Publishing Company, New York), reviewed in \\"Common Sense\\", was said to have a touch of theosophical thought, and a thread of profitable study running through the work. In her chapter on the \\"Methods of Nature\\" there is perhaps more beauty than logic in her arguments, but everyone who follows the purpose of the book will admit there is a spirit of conviction and pure sentiment which carries one to a higher place in the borderland of intellectuality.

Italo Meschi with his Ala d'Aquila (Eagle Wing) harp guitar Forty years after his death his long-forgotten trove of writings, compositions, and mementos began to resurface thanks to his closest relatives. Their rediscovery and appreciation by experts places Meschi among the great guitarists of the first half of the 20th century. His repertoire ranges from medieval music, such as the 14th-century piece \\"Laude alla Vergine\\", to Wagner, but also includes Tuscan and other European folk songs. He transcribed classical music intended for other instruments for the guitar. He also wrote his own compositions. Meschi was a near anarchist, pacifist, and nature lover who dressed in linen both summer and winter. A tireless walker, tall and handsome, he wore a beard with long reddish-blond hair, his bare feet in Franciscan footwear. The British press of the 1920s described him as \\"The Last Troubadour\\". Although he often performed for the best social circles and even for royalty, Meschi never commercialized his music. Proud of his ascetic lifestyle, at concerts he settled for a small donation. \\"Of the unnecessary, I do not care\\", he said, and \\"Musicians should create music also for the poor, in fact, mainly for the poor.\\" A noise, a conversation carried on during his performance was sometimes enough for him to refuse to play again. Early life His father Innocenzo Meschi was a tailor and his mother Filomena Bianchi a laundry worker. He had four siblings. He was a good student, but abandoned school after the fifth grade. He received his first musical lessons at the age of six, in the famous institute where G. Puccini and A. Catalani studied; but his parents took him out after the first year. Later he fell in love with the guitar, buying his first instrument at age 14. Around 1903, at age 16, his parents sent him to Lucca's Customs House to work as a porter. In 1907, he passed the Italian Railways competitive exam becoming a brakeman on the Pisa-Florence line. In 1913, the Railways fired him for absenteeism. That same year Meschi left Italy for California. Official records show he arrived at Ellis Island on 15 September 1913 aboard the SS Rochambeau. He worked at first as a dishwasher in hotels and as a migrant worker in California. Later Life and Career At age 26, \\"he learned how to read music at the San Francisco Public Library\\", as stated in an interview with the San Francisco News. Later he began to give concerts. He made his debut at the Arillaga Music College of San Francisco on 19 June 1919. His programme covered Italian vocal music from the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. Toward the end of 1919, he returned to Italy, and in the 1920s he began to tour Europe performing in many cities including Nice, Paris, Brussels, and London. He played his harp guitar throughout the Italian peninsula including a performance in front of King Victor Emmanuel III and Queen Elena at their summer home near Pisa. In April 1926, Ernest Collins of Collins & Lewis Productions Ltd. engaged Meschi for one year in London. The BBC also hired him for a radio audition. During this stay, he received wide coverage from British media. An article described him as a \\"strange and picturesque man believed to be the last of the Troubadours\\". He left London three months later after running into problems with his agent. Back in Italy, he resumed his concerts in Rome, in Dolomites hotels, on the Italian Riviera, and in Taormina. In his hometown of Lucca, he was at times the guest of Lucca's Mandolin Orchestra. In May 1935, he traveled to Geneva, Switzerland, where he performed for Radio Gen√®ve. In Lucca, he lived in a humble one-room flat on top of the Saint Gervasio tower part of the medieval city gate, his only possessions a small table, a chair, a bed, and his inseparable harp guitar or \\"wooden wife\\". On 25 June 1936, Italo Meschi returned to the United States for his third and last time. In 1937, Gaetano Merola, conductor and founder of the San Francisco Opera wrote: \\"Apparently Mr. Meschi has artistic attributes quite as impressive as his appearance. I enjoyed immensely Mr. Meschi's playing and singing. His interpretation of the Italian classics of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was a revelation to me.\\" That same year, music critic Alfred Frankenstein wrote on the San Francisco Chronicle: \\"Meschi is a picturesque artist. He plays a guitar that looks like a wing of the rock that carried Sinbad on its back. He has the beard and head of a Greek orthodox priest and the simplicity of a child. The first part of the programme was devoted mostly to old Italian songs and arias, hauntingly beautiful things rendered still finer by this troubadour's full, sonorous voice and reverent manner.\\" The Immigration and Naturalization Service did not extend Meschi's visa past 29 May 1937. He always referred to his departure as an \\"extradition\\". In retrospect, the visa extension denial may have gone well beyond the anti-immigration laws of that period. His unusual appearance and libertarianism may have led to the decision. His having held \\"more rallies than concerts\\" when he received the \\"extradition order\\" may have been the root of the problem. According to a written eyewitness account, \\"the day after his last concert in San Francisco, thugs attacked him tearing to pieces his guitar\\". Back in Italy, Italo Meschi ran into problems with the fascist authorities, including a documented failure to report at the headquarters of the regional fascist group. For years, he had been a member of a socioeconomic project known as \\"Hallesism\\". Based on mathematical postulates, Hallesism favoured a new system for regulating international trade (regulating it equitably and efficiently for the benefit of the entire world community). The fascist regime eventually confined its leader Agostino Trucco to a mental institution where he died in 1940. At the onset of World War II, Meschi withdrew to a humble stone cottage on the foothills of the Apuan mountains north of Lucca. There he worked the land, tended sheep, and wrote poetry. His poems carry a message against war, greed, environmental degradation, moral, and cultural disorientation. Many also deal with an unfulfilled love. In 1948, he played the part of Nicodemus in the Italian religious movie Il Volto Santo (The Holy Face). Among his last performances, before his final illness, is the one of 25 October 1954 at the Teatro dell'Arte al Parco in Milan, broadcast by the RAI Italian television network. He died of a lung ailment and in poverty at age 70 in the village of Carignano near Lucca. Technique Guitar maker Bruno Mattei built Meschi's first two harp guitars. Years later he performed with a harp guitar named Ala d'Aquila (\\"Eagle Wing\\"). As told by Meschi himself, it was built specifically for him by Luigi Mozzani and bought in March 1924 in Cento near Ferrara. His great skill, next to his instrumental skill, was his unique vocal ability, a voice that matched the originality of his repertoire. His baritone voice rose well beyond its natural texture. Meschi had a thin but \\"penetrating and persuasive\\" voice, a modular voice considering the rigor of sixteenth century arias, the great verve, and force of the Tuscan stornelli (folk songs) or of the mountain folk songs he picked up during his wandering and so loved to perform. The Dictionary of Italian Guitarists and Lute-Makers (1937, Benvenuto Terzi & others) states: \\"He displays grace, exquisite taste, and perfect technique. His guitar emits unheard harmonious sounds. He is a remarkable artist, one of a kind. In the hands of this unique artist, the guitar unveils unimaginable notes and shades. He impresses the public with his pleasant, warm, and always measured voice. However, what reveals his interpretative, instrumental, and vocal arts are Italian folk songs, where he remains unchallenged.\\" Repertoire The American record company Brunswick Records made two recordings of Italo Meschi's New York concert of 6 June 1929. On the first he played Notturno (probably by Giovanni Navone) and Francisco Tarrega's Tango. On the second he sang Stornellata Romana and Questa Mattina (This Morning). Also in June 1929, Gennett Records of New York recorded another song, La Indita. At his concerts, Meschi also played a Beethoven aria, a nocturne, a rhapsody (Souvenir de St. Paul) by Giovanni Domenico Navone, an Andalusian fandango, some Sor studies, Luciano Castagna's Serenata, etc. He performed pieces from the 16th and 17th centuries by A. Falconieri, C. Monteverdi, and R. Rontani. He also composed his own pieces. His works included two lullabies, Melanconie\\" and \\"Partenza and three pieces based on poems by Giovanni Pascoli,\\"La Poesia\\" , \\"Il Brivido\\" , and \\"La Mia Sera\\". Meschi loved Bach's polyphony. He spent much of his time transcribing pieces before playing them at concerts with his harp guitar. A dozen of his manuscripts have recently been found including a 1948 transcription of Bach's famous Toccata and Fugue in D minor BWV 565 for organ. It is unclear which Bach music Meschi interpreted in his concerts. However, postwar years' evidence suggests the challenge of mastering such difficult pieces on the harp guitar had become for him almost an obsession. The Italo Meschi archive resides at the Banca del Monte di Lucca. Personal life Italo Meschi never married. \\"Admired and coveted by many beautiful women, yet always absorbed in his musical environment, he valued them precious little\\", wrote his brother Mario. During the war years, at age 56, he did fall in love with a younger woman with a long and inconclusive relationship. He was a vegetarian who left behind recipes and recommendations for food deficiencies. As an early environmentalist, he laid out a plan on how to make his town livable. In Lucca, people referred to him as the \\"Christ\\" for his long thick beard and Nazarene-style hair. Devout in his own way, he had disagreements with the Church. To honour his art, locals called him \\"Maestro Italo\\". In October 1957, a day after his death, the daily La Nazione referred to his \\"sincere and incorruptible spirit which did not allow bending to the demands of our modern consumer society\\". \\"Therein lies the commercial handicap\\", had written,three decades earlier, British author Constance Vaughan in her article \\"The Last of the Troubadours\\", after having interviewed Maestro Italo.

It is one of two energy companies in the UK to be involved both in electricity transmission and electricity distribution. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks manages two distribution networks and one transmission network. The company manages two of the fourteen distribution licenses in Great Britain. The company's electricity distribution and transmission networks carry electricity to over 3.7 million homes and businesses across the north of the Central Belt of Scotland, as well as Central Southern England. The company operates in the United Kingdom with head offices in Perth, Scotland and Reading, England.  History   Origins  The company has its origins in two public sector electricity supply authorities. Scottish Hydroelectric, founded as the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board in 1943, was established to design, construct and manage hydroelectricity projects in the Highlands of Scotland, and took over a further generation and distribution responsibilities when the UK's electricity industry was nationalized in 1948. Southern Electric, founded as Southern Electricity Board in 1948, was created to distribute electricity in Southern England. While the Southern Electricity Board was a distribution-only authority with no power generation capacity of its own, the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board was a broader spectrum organisation which did have power- generating capabilities. Because of its history and location, the Hydroelectric Board was responsible for most of the UK's hydroelectric generating capacity. Both authorities were privatized and re-branded in 1990/91, initially retaining their pre-privatization geographic and functional bases.  Post-privatization  In 1998, Scottish and Southern Energy was formed following a merger between Scottish Hydroelectric and Southern Electric. This part of the SSE plc group is now referred to as Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks.  Rebranding  Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks van In September 2016, the well-known trading names of Scottish and Southern Energy Power Distribution (SSEPD), Scottish Hydro Electric Power Distribution (SHEPD), Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission (SHET), and Southern Electric Power Distribution (SEPD), merged into a single trading entity known as the Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks. The licensee names of the four have not changed. As part of the rebranding, Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks changed their logo, color scheme, imagery set, social media channels, and website. They also introduced a new company motto centered around being a part of the community they serve: \\"Powering our Community.\\"  Operations  Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks operate the economically regulated electricity distribution and transmission networks across the north of the Central Belt of Scotland and also Central Southern England, delivering power to 3.7 million homes. With a work force of over 4,000 working from 85 depots and offices, they look after a network that consists of: * 130,000 km of overhead lines and underground cables * 106,000 substations * Over 100 sub sea cables, powering island communities such as Orkney and Hebrides.  Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks‚ÄîCentral Southern England  The Central Southern England network is the larger of two distribution networks and delivers electrical supplies to over 12.9 million customers across central southern England. The operational region ranges from rural communities in Hampshire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire to towns and cities including Bournemouth, Oxford, Portsmouth, Reading, Southampton, Slough, Swindon and in parts of West London. They also distribute electricity to and across the Isle of Wight.  Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks‚ÄîNorthern Scotland  The Northern Scotland network is the smaller of the two, and delivers electricity to some 740,000 customers in the north of Scotland. This operating region covers a quarter of the UK landmass which attracts unique challenges both regarding distance and location. As well as the major towns and cities of Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness and Perth, they connect to most Scottish islands with over 100 sub sea cable links, including the Inner and Outer Hebrides, Arran and the Orkney Islands. They also serve the Shetland Islands, which runs as a separate electrical system without a connection to the mainland.  Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission (SHE Transmission)  SHE Transmission owns and maintains the 132 kV and 275 kV electricity transmission network in the north of Scotland, in some of the UK's most challenging geographical terrains. Some of their circuits are situated over 750 meters above sea level and or up to 250 km long. The operating area contains a vast renewable energy resource, utilized in forms such as wind and marine generation. These generators are all dependent on SHE Transmission for transportation to the load centers to the south.  Independent distribution network operator  In addition to the distribution network operators who are licensed for a specific geographic area, there are also independent distribution network operators (IDNOs). IDNOs own and operate electricity distribution networks, which are predominantly network extensions connected to an existing distribution network. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks also provides distribution services in South Scotland as an IDNO and in all other English and Welsh areas.  Services  Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks provides a number of services across its distribution areas. In the event of a power outage, it is the responsibility of Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks to repair the fault and get power back on for affected areas. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks also has a Priority Services Register to support customers with disabilities or particular vulnerabilities in the event of a power outage. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks has a team dedicated to dealing with non-emergency electricity network jobs in central southern England and northern Scotland. These services range from shrouding overhead power cables to locating underground electricity cables so that those cables can be worked around safely. A spokesperson for the Energy Networks Association said ‚ÄúThe charges for connection applications have been introduced following a recent government consultation, which found that the majority of industry supported the change.\\"  Economically-regulated businesses  Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks transmits and distributes electricity to around 3.7 million businesses, offices, and homes through some 130,000 kilometres of overhead lines and underground cables. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks are regulated by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem).

Gary is a founding member of the rhythm and blues horn rock band from Chicago, Illinois, The Mob. Early Years Gary grew up in a house surrounded by music. His sister played the flute, one of his brothers played trumpet while another older brother played guitar. In grade school, he took lessons on the clarinet and started doubling on saxophone in Junior High. Gary liked the good stuff in many genres, big band and small combo jazz, classical standards, pop, and musical theater. Gary went to West Aurora High School in Illinois. During those high school years emerged the band ‚ÄúThe Maybees‚Äù, his first exposure to playing rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll at the age of 15. They played many teen dances, called record hops at that time, and various other weekend engagements in the Chicago suburbs. By the time graduation rolled around the group had also released three 45s on Terry Records. Beisbier went on to college at Northern Illinois University where he was active in the music program. Career Gary Beisbier and Jim Holvay co-wrote the hit songs Don't You Care, Hey Baby (They're Playing Our Song) and Susan for The Buckinghams in the late 1960s while they were in The Mob. The Mob played to packed venues and their showmanship and talent pleased the audiences to the limit. Gary was a multi-talented musician and played several different instruments in the Mob. He was the band's arranger for most of the charts and presentation of the Mob in concert. The songwriting team of Beisbier and Holvay produced two more top 100 Billboard- charting songs on the Colossus record label produced by Jerry Ross (record producer) in 1971. \\"I Dig Everything About You\\" peaked at #83 on the charts.

All four sister ships were requisitioned when Italy joined the war in 1915. Originally named V√¢rtej by the Romanians, she was renamed Nibbio in Italian service. Not completed until mid-1918, the ship engaged Austro-Hungarian ships in the Adriatic Sea only once before the war ended in November. She was renamed MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti when she was re-purchased by the Romanians in 1920. After the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 (Operation Barbarossa), MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti was limited to escort duties in the western half of the Black Sea during the war by the powerful Soviet Black Sea Fleet which heavily outnumbered Axis naval forces there. The ship claimed to have sunk a Soviet submarines during the war, but this has not been confirmed by post-war research. In early 1944 the Soviets were able to cut off and surround the port of Sevastopol on the Crimean Peninsula; MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti escorted convoys evacuating Axis troops from the port and rescued some troops herself in May. Later that year Romania switched sides, but despite that the Soviets seized the Romanian ships and incorporated them into the Soviet Navy. Renamed Lyogkiy, the ship only served for a year before she was returned to the Romanians who redesignated her as D11 in 1952. She was discarded in 1961 and subsequently scrapped. Design and description Plan and right elevation line drawing of the Aquila-class scout cruisers The Vifor- class destroyers were ordered in 1913 by Romania from the Pattison Shipyard in Italy, as part of the 1912 Naval Program. They were to be armed with three guns, four guns, five torpedo tubes and have a 10-hour endurance at full speed. Three ships had been laid down by the time Italy joined the Allied side in World War I on 23 May 1915 by declaring war on the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Italians requisitioned the Romanian ships on 5 June, redesignating them as Aquila-class scout cruisers (esploratori). By this time V√¢rtej approximately 20 percent complete and was renamed Nibbio.Twardowski, p. 421Fraccaroli, p. 266 The ships had an overall length of , had a beam of , and a draft of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. Their crew numbered 9 officers and 137 sailors. The ships were powered by two Tosi steam turbines, each driving a single propeller, using steam provided by five Thornycroft boilers. The turbines were designed to produce for a speed of , although Nibbio reached during her sea trials from . The scouts carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at a speed of . The Italians initially intended to arm the ships with seven 120 mm guns and two pairs of twin mounts for 45 cm torpedo tubes, but they changed the gun armament to three and four 76 mm weapons to outgun their nearest Austro-Hungarian equivalents, the Admiral Spaun and scout cruisers. Two of the 152 mm guns were mounted side-by-side on the forecastle and the third gun was mounted on the aft superstructure. The 76 mm anti-aircraft (AA) guns were positioned two on each broadside. The torpedo mounts were abreast the middle funnel, one on each broadside. Unlike her sisters, Nibbio could only carry 24 mines. Construction and service Nibbio in port, 1918; her sister Aquila is behind her Nibbio was laid down on 15 July 1914 by Pattison in its Naples shipyard. She was launched on 30 January 1918 and commissioned on 15 May 1918. Assigned to the Adriatic, the ship was protecting the recovery of a broken-down flying boat in the Gulf of Drin with her sisters and Sparviero on 5 September when they spotted three Austro-Hungarian torpedo boats sweeping mines. The sisters opened fire and damaged 86 F before the torpedo boats reached the shelter of Medua's coastal artillery. The following month, the trio escorted Allied ships as they bombarded Durazzo, Albania, on 2 October. Nibbio, Aquila and Sparviero covered the ships bombarding Medua on 21 October.Cernuschi & O'Hara, pp. 69, 73 Nibbio and Sparviero were re-purchased by Romania in 1920. Nibbio became MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti and Sparviero was renamed MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti when they were commissioned after arriving in Romania on 1 July 1920. The ships were formally re-classified as destroyers and assigned to the newly formed Counter-torpedo Division () which was renamed as the Destroyer Squadron () on 1 April 1927. The sisters were sent to Italy in 1925‚Äì1926 for a refit where they had their 152 mm guns replaced by two twin-gun 120 mm Schneider- Canet-Armstrong 1918/19 turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure, and a fifth gun on a platform amidships. The aft 76 mm guns removed during this time.Whitley, p. 223 Fire-control systems were fitted the following year. The Squadron was visited by King Carol II of Romania and the Prime Minister, Nicolae Iorga, on 27 May 1931. By 1940, the midships 120 mm gun had been replaced by a pair of twin-gun French Hotchkiss anti-aircraft machinegun mounts and the remaining 76 mm guns by a pair of German SK C/30 AA guns. Depth charge racks had been fitted on the stern and an Italian depth charge thrower was added. The ships could carry 40 depth charges or 50 mines. These changes reduced the displacement of the sisters to at standard load and at deep load.Axworthy, pp. 348‚Äì349; Whitley, pp. 223‚Äì224 World War II MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti at sea, 1942 Massively outnumbered by the Soviet Union's Black Sea Fleet, the Romanian ships were kept behind the minefields defending Constan»õa for several months after the start of the war. They spent that time training for convoy escort operations. Beginning on 5 October, the Romanians began laying minefields to defend the route between the Bosphorus and Constan»õa; the minelayers were protected by the destroyers. After the evacuation of Odessa on 16 October, the navy began to clear the Soviet mines defending the port and to lay their own minefields protecting the route between Constan»õa and Odessa. MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti was twice attacked off Mangalia, Romania, on 6 November 1941 by the , but was missed with all four torpedoes. Sometime during 1941‚Äì1942, the ship's turbines were damaged and limited her to a speed of . On 20 April 1942, after the ice had melted, MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti, MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti and the destroyer escorted the first convoy to Ochakov, although the Romanian destroyers were generally used to escort ships between the Bosporus and Constan»õa. On the nights of 22/23 and 24/25 June, MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti, Regina Maria and her sister covered the laying of defensive minefields off Odessa. After Sevastopol surrendered on 4 July to the Axis, a direct route between the port and Constan»õa was opened in October and operated year-round.Axworthy, pp. 333‚Äì335, 337‚Äì338; Hervieux, pp. 76‚Äì77; Rohwer, pp. 112, 160, 176; Whitley, p. 224 MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti and MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti and two gunboats were escorting a convoy of three cargo ships on 7 July 1943 when they were attacked by a small wolfpack of three submarines. fired six torpedoes at one of the gunboats and a freighter and missed with all of them. MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti depth charged one of the submarines and claimed to have sunk it, but no submarines were lost by the Soviets that day.Hervieux, p. 81; Rohwer, p. 254 On the night of 9/10 November, the sisters escorted minelayers as they laid a minefield off Sevastopol. The minefield was enlarged between 14 and 16 November as Regele Ferdinand and MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti covered the minelayers. The submarine sank the German freighter off Yevpatoria despite an escort of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti and three smaller ships on 23 November.Hervieux, p. 81; Rohwer, p. 287 At some point during the war, the ship's anti-aircraft armament was augmented with two additional 3.7 cm SK C/30 and four AA guns. MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti in 1944 Successful Soviet attacks in early 1944 cut the overland connection of the Crimea with the rest of Ukraine and necessitated its supply by sea. In early April another offensive occupied most of the peninsula and encircled Sevastopol. The Romanians began evacuating the city on 14 April, with their destroyers covering the troop convoys. Adolf Hitler suspended the evacuation on 27 April, but relented on 8 May after further Soviet attacks further endangered the Axis forces in Sevastopol as they closed within artillery range of the harbour. MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti made one trip to evacuate Axis troops and was part of the last convoy to reach Sevastopol on the night of 11/12 May. MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti and Regina Maria covered the minelayers and as they sealed off the gap that led to Sevastpol in the minefields defending Sulina on the night of 25/26 May. MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti was slightly damaged during a Soviet airstrike on Constan»õa on 20 August.Axworthy, pp. 342‚Äì345; Hervieux, pp. 82‚Äì84, 87; Rohwer, pp. 319, 351 After King Michael's Coup on 23 August, Romania declared war on the Axis Powers. MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti remained in harbour until she was seized by the Soviets on 5 September together with the rest of the Romanian Navy.Axworthy, p. 345; Hervieux, p. 88 Renamed Lyogkiy on 20 October, the ship was commissioned into the Soviet Navy as part of the Black Sea Fleet, along with her sister, on 14 September. They were returned to Romania on 12 October 1945Rohwer & Monakov, p. 268Berezhnoy, p. 13 where they resumed their former names. The sisters were then assigned to the Destroyer Squadron before beginning an overhaul. When the Destroyer Division was redesignated as the 418th Destroyer Division in 1952, MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti was renamed D11. The ship continued to serve until April 1961, when she was discarded and subsequently scrapped.

It claimed to be the oldest such company in France, and at its peak was the largest. The company was innovative in providing insurance and a profit-sharing plan to its workers. In the late 1930s it went into decline, and in 1957 was absorbed by Menier Chocolate. Foundation Experiments in France with pressing out cocoa butter date back to at least 1760. One of the labels of the \\"Lombert\\" brand of chocolates dates its use from 1760. This was ten years before Pelletier et Pelletier founded a chocolate factory in 1770. Lombart claimed to be the first chocolate company in France. The illustrious clients included Madame Victoire, and then the Duchess of Angoul√™me, also known as Madame Royale. The company produced superior chocolates, fine sweets, chocolate fantasies and Lombart tea. An old box from the Maison Chocolat Lombart is decorated with two medallions recording patents granted by King Louis XVI of France and later by the Ducess of Angoul√™me in 1814. The wooden box closed with an iron hook and was lined with fabric. The label shows that the box held chocolate tablets containing nougat cream and priced at 5c per tablet. 19th century Jules-Fran√ßois Lombart was born in Paris on 24 February 1830. His parents were from Doullens, Somme.. Lombart became proprietor around 1870. He received the Cross of the Legion of Honour on 23 July 1881 after the Melbourne International Exhibition (1880), where the company had a large display. Lombart introduced various improvements in the manufacturing process, gradually increasing daily output to of chocolate. The factory was moved from 3 Rue des Vieille-√âtuves-Saint-Honor√© to the Rue Jean- de-Deauvais, then to the Rue Keller in the 11th arrondissement, and finally to 75 Avenue de Choisy. In 1860 the factory and offices were located at 75 avenue de Choisy, in the 13th arrondissement of Paris, and were to remain there until the 1940s. The Chocolaterie Lombart had an exhibit in the Palace of Machines in the Exposition Universelle (1889). In 1889 the Lombart factory was described as a model establishment, the first, the most powerful and the most remarkable of such factories in Paris. It covered and employed over 500 people. The sales office was at 11 Boulevard des Italiens. Lombart established an insurance plan for the workers to cover workplace accidents, including a daily allowance during sickness, medical attention and help with funeral expenses. He also built houses for the workers. Chocolaterie Lombart wrapping and packing factory around 1889 Lombart instituted a plan by which the workers were given a share of the annual profits. The annual bonus, which in the 1880s varied from 60,000 to 100,000 francs in total, was divided among the workers and staff based on seniority, salary and merit. The owner and two senior managers determined merit, grading performance as \\"very good\\", \\"good\\", \\"quite good\\", \\"acceptable\\" and \\"poor\\". The bonus was calculated for each of the three evaluations and then averaged. Each worker's bonus took the form of shares in a retirement fund, which paid the worker a pension after 30 years. Young girls were given a portion of their shares at the time of the marriage. The workers were encouraged to save through a monthly payment of 2 francs invested in a fund called l'Abeille. 20th century The Chocolaterie Lombart, at the beginning of the twentieth century, was \\"the biggest factory in Paris\\", and also had an establishment in Ivry. The company packaged colored cards with its chocolate. Around 1900 it published a series of images of the future world titled \\"This is how our great-grandchildren will live in the year 2012\\". The series gave an optimistic view, including one of modern aviation replacing the Zeppelin. One card showed a couple speaking over the telephone to friends in India, with a camera obscura image of their friends projected on the wall. Another showed a brightly-lit passenger submarine. The company also distributed paper models of people such as a policement or jockey with a toothpick as an axle. When assembled and twirled around the toys would perform acrobatics. The factory was managed dynamically, and at its peak employed almost 800 workers. It went into rapid decline after the strikes of 1936. In the late 1940s the headquarters and offices were located at 68 rue de Mirosmesnil in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. In 1957 Menier Chocolate absorbed the company. The factory at 75 avenue de Choisy is now the site of the lyc√©e Gabriel Faur√©. The greater part of the collection of the Mus√©e Lombart in Doullens comes from the legacy that Jules Fran√ßois Lombart (1830-1915) gave to the town in 1908. The factory at 75 avenue de Choisy was described by the novelist Anne-Marie Garat in her novel Dans la main du diable.

It is native to shallow waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean and forms colonies of tubes on rocks and submerged objects. Description Worms in the family Chaetopteridae have soft bodies and occupy permanent chitinous or parchment-like tubes that they create. P. prolifica is a colonial species which forms dense collections of tubes, many of which are branched. Clusters of these tubes may be high. At the anterior end of the worm is the prostomium which bears a pair of eyes and a pair of long palps but no antennae. The peristomium (area surrounding the mouth) has a pair of short tentacles. Below this, the segmented body is divided into three regions which differ in the arrangement of the parapodia (lateral lobes). On the first segment of the anterior region of the body is a pair of tentacular cirri and a pair of palps. The middle region consists of four to twelve segments and the posterior region consists of many short segments. Distribution and habitat P. prolifica is native to the eastern Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from British Columbia to Baja California and from Ecuador to southern Chile. It is found in the subtidal zone with a depth range of , typically on rocks, but also on pilings and floating docks. Ecology P. prolifica is an opportunistic feeder, being a deposit feeder or a suspension feeder depending on circumstances. It can reproduce asexually by dividing to form new individuals, or can breed sexually by shedding sperm and eggs into the sea. The dense colonies of branching tubes of this worm provide a habitat with an abundance of food and low risk of predation for the juveniles of some species of starfish. Researchers in Washington state found that the larvae of the vermillion sea star (Mediaster aequalis) preferentially settled on the tubes. They also found juveniles of the sand star (Luidia foliolata), the common sunstar (Crossaster papposus), the Pacific blood star (Henricia leviuscula), the sun star (Solaster stimpsoni), the morning sun star (Solaster dawsoni), and the slime star (Pteraster tesselatus) on the worm tubes but not in the surrounding environment.

The onion router allows the user to connect to the internet anonymously creating an anonymous connection. Tor works using an overlaid network which is free throughout the world, this overlay network is created by using numerous relay points created using volunteer which helps the user hide personal information behind layers of encrypted data like layers of an onion. Routers are being created using Raspberry Pi adding a wireless module or using its own inbuilt wireless module in the later versions. This router provides encryption at the seventh layer (application layer) of the OSI model, which makes it transparent encryption, the user does not have to think about how the data will be sent or received. The encrypted data includes the destination and origin IP address of the data and the current relay point only knows the previous and the next hop of the encrypted packet. These relay points are selected in a random order and can only decrypt a single layer before forwarding it to the next hop where is the procedure is followed unless it is the destination point. Applications A wireless router which can use the onion router network can be used to keep the user safe from hackers or network sniffers. The data captured by them won't make any sense as it will only look like messed up text. These are small and handy which will give the user a freedom to carry this tool and connect to the network from anywhere. This setup does not require installation of Tor browser on the work station. Whistle blowers and NGO workers use this network to pass information or to talk to their family without disclosing any information. The applications of wireless onion router are common to a normal router, it provides access that allows it to be placed at a site and users can get connected. Tor can be used in security focused Operating Systems, messengers, browsers. These can be anonymised using tor network. Weaknesses A wireless onion router works on the tor network and shares the same weaknesses, as mentioned in the Tor page. The University of Michigan has created a scanner capable of scanning almost 90% of bridges that are live in a single scan. The packets that transferred using Tor also are slow because of the increased amount of hops with encryption and decryption.  Anonymous System (Eavesdropping)  Anonymous systems if exists on both ends of the network, exit relay and entry relay can sniff the packets and statistically correlate the traffic which can point out the destination or the source address of the packet. This also includes eavesdropping at the exit nodes of the network. The data that is between the exit node and the destination server is not encrypted. These data packets can be captured easily. This captured data can reveal the source information, and as suggested by Egersta these nodes are costly to run and require a lot of bandwidth which could suggest that some intelligence agencies might be running them. There have been tested techniques with one third of control nodes to compromise the tor network.  Traffic Analysis  Articles have been proposed which with some partial knowledge of the network give away which nodes are being used to relay the packets which reduces the anonymity provided by the network. Another techniques which shows relations between streams and then can be linked back to the initiator are available, this technique however does not reveal the source.  IP Exposing Protocols  Some protocols can be used to expose the IP address using tor dissimulation procedures. Some of the examples are Inspection of control messages of BitTorrent, Hijacking responses of the trackers, exploitation of distributed hash tables.

He is one of the business tycoons in the list of individuals who provide political and financial support for Myanmar's ruling regime and government. Early life and family Nay Shwe Thway Aung was born in Yangon in the ruling family of Myanmar. He is the only son of Nay Soe Maung, an army doctor and his wife Kyi Kyi Shwe, a daughter of the head of state, Than Shwe. He attended high school at Practising School Yangon Institute of Education and enrolled in West Yangon Technological University. Business holding Nay Shwe Thway Aung is a major broker between the regime officials and business leaders. He has earned a reputation as being one of the most notorious members of the ruling family. He has been accused of ordering military officers, serving as his assistants, to carry out attacks on business rivals, and even top generals are said to be wary of displeasing him. Nay Shwe Thway Aung has close ties to key figures, such as business tycoon Zaw Zaw. Through his relationships, Zaw Zaw has won concessions and import licenses, including most of the country's car and motorcycle imports licenses, as well as import and distribution licenses for fuel.

In January 2009, Nay Shwe Thway Aung intended to purchase Manchester United football club, for US $1 billion, according to US diplomatic cables revealed by WikiLeaks, but he reportedly abandoned the plan, because such an investment only months after nearly 150,000 people were killed by Cyclone Nargis, was deemed inappropriate.

She has served as Colombia's Vice-Minister of Education, and is the founder and current Executive Director of Escuela Nueva Foundation. She has won numerous awards for her work. In 2013 she received the Wise Prize for Education from the Qatar Foundation and in September, 2017 she won the Yidan Prize for Education Development from the Yidan Prize Foundation. Life Colbert came from a family with a strong interest in education reform. Her godfather had been Colombia‚Äôs minister of education, and her mother was a teacher who also founded teacher training colleges. Her father was an officer in the U.S. Navy. A Ford Foundation scholarship allowed her to study comparative education as a graduate student at Stanford University. She then returned to Colombia where ‚ÄúI wanted to tackle basic education and work with the poorest of the poor schools, the isolated schools.‚Äù She went to work in rural Colombia, where many families grow coffee. Children frequently dropped out of school to help on the family farm during harvest season, which created problems if they returned to class much later. A related problem was that rural teachers often taught several grade levels in a single classroom. She saw the need to structure a system of education that was flexible enough to accommodate such schedules. In the mid-1970s she worked with others, notably Oscar Mogoll√≥n and Beryl Levinger to devise the model known as Escuela Nueva. A key element of the Escuela Nueva school is that children learn at their own rate by using Learning Guide, which Colbert describes as \\"a combination of a textbook, workbook and a guide for the teacher.\\" These guides suggest hands-on activities for students to do both in school and at home. Students work their way through the guide at their own pace, with teachers serving as advisers, and students who have mastered a lesson often helping those who have not. Inspired by the work of John Dewey, Maria Montessori, and other progressive educators, the schools are also democratic in spirit, with teachers, students, and parents all involved in decision-making. It took many years of effort for the Escuela Nueva model to become widespread throughout Colombia, but it is now used in 20,000 schools in that country. Colbert noted that ‚Äúit's not just governmental support but also ground support that is needed to influence change in the education system.\\" It has continued to spread and Escuela Nueva schools are now in 19 countries including Brazil, the Philippines and India.

Background In early September 2017 Hurricane Irma swept across the Caribbean, causing catastrophic damage to the British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, the Turks and Caicos Islands and the British Virgin Islands. On 7 September Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, announced ¬£32 million had been allocated to a relief fund to support those affected. Military A Puma helicopter is loaded into a C-17 ahead of its deployment to the Carribean. Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) ship was deployed to the Caribbean in July 2017 in preparation for the 2017 hurricane season and was therefore able to render immediate assistance as the storm passed northwards. Mounts Bays Wildcat helicopter and mexefloat were used to land equipment, of supplies and personnel to provide medical and engineering support on Anguilla, including repairing the island's hospital and airport, before sailing overnight for the British Virgin Islands. Following a meeting of the government's emergency committee, COBRA, on 7 September, Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon announced that the Royal Navy's flagship, the helicopter carrier would be diverted from her NATO deployment in the Mediterranean to provide assistance. Ocean arrived at Gibraltar on 11 September to embark supplies, including 4√ó4 vehicles and building materials donated by the Government of Gibraltar. Four Royal Air Force (RAF) Chinook helicopters carrying aid for embarkation in Gibraltar flew from RAF Benson via fuelling stops in San Sebastian and Sevilla in Spain; this was unusual because Spain normally blocks military flights from its territory and airspace if they are bound to Gibraltar; however due to the humanitarian nature of these flights clearance was granted . A Royal Air Force A400M Atlas in Barbados preparing to transport essential shelters to the British Virgin Islands. On 8 September nearly 300 UK military personnel, including those from 40 Commando Royal Marines together with engineers and specialist personnel from all three Services departed RAF Brize Norton. RAF C17, Voyager and A400M aircraft were deployed carrying medical supplies and aid including emergency shelter kits, rations and clean water.. The aircraft initially landed in Barbados, which is being used as a hub to distribute aid. The C17 continued its journey onto the US Virgin Islands ‚Äì the island with the only usable runway in the region - with 85 personnel on board. A further C17 left the UK on 9 September carrying an RAF Puma helicopter with an additional 2 Puma helicopters departing the following day. By 12 September 997 British personnel were in the region, made up of marines, engineers, medics and specialists, including Royal Navy, Army and RAF personnel. The commander for the operation was Brigadier John Ridge. Ridge countered criticism of the operation and said \\"the [operation presents] unique and vast geographical and logistical challenges\\". With Hurricane Maria approaching on 18 September it was announced that the 1,300 British personnel already in the region would remain on the affected islands or in locations nearby to render immediate assistance. Additional personnel were deployed to Montserrat to provide assistance should Maria hit the island. Ocean arrived in the region on 22 September and proceeded to conduct 253 hours of flying including 81 separate trips and moved more than 1,000 people by air. 9 Assault Squadron Royal Marines conducted almost 200 landing craft launches and recoveries, landing 600 people and stores across 17 isolated locations. In total, Ocean delivered 8,300 man hours of engineering and logistical support enabling the recovery of critical national infrastructure alongside large scale clean-up operations across four separate island chains. Ocean also evacuated 39 vulnerable British nationals from Dominica, one of whom was very seriously ill and received life- saving treatment on board. By 10 October, the military effort was winding down, 40 Commando Royal Marines flew back to the United Kingdom and Ocean sailed for Miami for refueling and storing before resuming her NATO mission in the Mediterranean. Mounts Bay remained in the region to provide support for the remainder of the hurricane season. Civilian On 8 September 2017, the Royal Cayman Islands Police Service Air Operations Unit in their EC135 helicopter departed Grand Cayman to pre-position at Guantanamo Naval Base, arriving in the tail of Irma. Following the all clear, the helicopter, callsign X-Ray One arrived at first light into Turks and Caicos and for 36 hours was the main aid to the Islands in assessing damage and transporting people, leading to the declaration of the state of emergency. X-Ray One crew stayed for seven days as part of Operation Ruman, making 36 flights, until relieved by a Canadian Navy Sea King. Aid was supplied from Department for International Development's disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield in Gloucestershire, including 10,000 UK aid buckets and 5,000 UK solar lanterns. 53 police officers from 14 UK police forces were deployed to the British Virgin Islands to assist in maintaining law and order. A contingent of specialist prison officers were deployed to run the island's prison. In conjunction with military and police support 21 of the most high risk prisoners were transferred by air to a prison in St Lucia.

Biography Nelson was born in Chicago, Illinois to an American middle-class family of Irish origin. From 1913 to 1917 he studied at Princeton University and in 1917 he enrolled as a volunteer in the LaFayette Escadrille, which was a U.S. unit constituted in 1916 and operated under French command during World War I. Nelson returned to America after the war to work at a bank and then transitioned to work at his father‚Äôs interior decoration company. He moved to Paris in 1920 and continued his studies at the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in the private workshop of Emmanuel Pontremoli and Auguste Perret. He married a French woman, Francine Le C≈ìur. Francine was the daughter of Fran√ßois Le C≈ìur, an architect and teacher at the √âcole Sp√©ciale d'Architecture in Paris. In 1927, Nelson entered the Register of Architects and was certified by the government. He settled in Varengeville-sur-Mer, working in the same workshop used years before by Claude Monet, Jean-Baptiste Corot, and Eug√®ne Isabey. He was friends with figures such as Ernest Hemingway, Ezra Pound, and Francis Scott Fitzgerald. He knew many artists such as Georges Braque, Joan Mir√≥, Pablo Picasso, Alexander Calder, Andr√© Derain, Fernand L√©ger, and Alberto Giacometti. During the Second World War, Nelson returned to the United States and acted as chairman of the ‚ÄúFrance for ever‚Äù movement, which aimed to spread French culture to Americans. In 1944, he was appointed as head of the Construction and Urban Planning division at the French Supply mission in Washington. In 1945, he became the Technical Advisor to the French Ministry of Reconstruction. He later took the role as adviser to the US National Health Service for the French Ministry of Public Health. He organized an exhibition at Grand Palais regarding American architectural and construction techniques. His wife died in 1951, and a year later he married the painter Madd Giannattasio, daughter of Ugo Giannattasio, futurist painter and writer. The couple had two sons, Ugo and Rory, an architect and a musician respectively. Nelson taught in the most prestigious American universities. In 1963, Andr√© Malraux appointed him as Director of Atelier Franco-Am√©ricain d‚ÄôArchitecture at l‚Äô√âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts. Between 1967 and 1977, he also headed the Atelier Franco-International in Marseille. In 1973, Nelson obtained French citizenship. Nelson died in 1979. He was buried in the Varengeville-sur-Mer cemetery, near his wife Madd Giannattasio and the painter Georges Braque, his great friend who had joined him in Normandy in 1929 and for whom he had designed the atelier. Works Nelson's research was focused on space conception and the use of prefabrication. He became an expert on hospital architecture, which was the subject of his thesis. One of Nelson's first works was the Parisian residence of the American author Alden Brooks, designed in 1929. In 1930, he designed the decorations of Allan Dwan's movie What a widow! with Gloria Swanson. In 1932, Nelson presented a project for the new hospital in Lille, published in Cahiers d‚ÄôArt in 1933. The project was ambitious but was refused due to being a foreign architect. Paul Nelson, on the left, with Robert Pontraby and Anatole Koop, on the right In 1934, Nelson designed the surgical building of the hospital of the Suez Canal company in Ismailia, north-east Egypt. He changed the form of operating rooms, which become ovoid, using glass floors and walls. Despite his work's appreciation, it was not carried out in his innovation and the hospital was built using more traditional designs created by the company architect. The project was published on Cahiers d‚ÄôArt in 1935 in an article signed by Jean H√©lion. From 1936 to 1938, Nelson worked on the design of a suspended house to show the benefits of steel construction as a solution to standard housing. For the project, he involved artists such as Jean Arp, Alexandre Calder, Fernand L√©ger, Joan Mir√≥. In 1937, Nelson participated in the competition of the international exhibition \\"Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne\\" for the Palais de la D√©couverte at Grand Palais. His constructivist architecture project was not accepted. The same year, he joined his friend Fernand L√©ger in a contest for the radio WGN of Chicago. After the war, Nelson worked on his magnum opus: the Centre Hospitalier M√©morial France - √âtats-Unis in Saint-L√¥, designed and built between 1946 and 1956, with contribution from the United States. In 1946, Nelson worked together with Alberto Giacometti to design a memorial to Gabriel P√©ri. Nelson took part in an experimental construction project of three modern buildings with the help of Charles Tillon (Minister for Reconstruction and Urban Planning in 1947). It was related to Noisy-le-Sec reconstruction. He worked on it closely from 1950 to 1953 with architects Roger Gilbert and Charles S√©billotte. In 1955, Nelson submitted a design for the Mus√©e national Fernand L√©ger in Biot; it was not accepted, and the museum was built to the design of Andre√Ø Svetchine. Between 1967 and 1977, Nelson designed the Policlinique Fran√ßois I in Le Havre, as well as Dinan (1968) and Arles hospitals (1965‚Äì1974).

No written records from the time Li lived record where she was born, but popular modern theories suggest that she was the daughter of an official, who was demoted and his family either killed or sold. Li was adopted by the owner of a brothel in Nanjing called Meixiang House (), whose surname she took. She was taught to dance, sing, paint, play music, and write poetry. Meixiang House was a favoured brothel of the literati and officials, with Li's adopted mother known for her generosity and chivalry. By age 13, Li was renowned for her singing and playing the pipa that her mistress charged 20 gold taels per guest to see her. Li met Hou Fangyu at Meixiang House in 1648. Hou sent her poems and Li performed for him in return. When Hou left to sit the imperial examinations (which he failed), Li waited for him and refused to perform for the inspector general of Huaiyang County.

There are in total 14 genes that are involved in programmed cell death, other important ones including ced-4 and ced-9 genes. The healthy nematode worm will require 131 somatic cell deaths out of the 1090 cells during the developmental stages. The gene initially encodes for a prototypical caspase (procaspase) where the active cysteine residue cleaves aspartate residues, thus becoming a functional caspase. Ced-3 is an executioner caspase (cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed protease) that must dimerize with itself and be initiated by ced-4 in order to become active. Once active, it will have a series of reactions that will ultimately lead to the apoptosis of targeted cells. Programmed cell death in C. elegans will occur in the embryonic and post-embryonic stages in both somatic and germ line cells. During embryogenesis is when the ced-3 transcript is at its highest peak due to the numerous cells that need to undergo cell suicide. Most programmed cell deaths occur in the brain tissue of the C. elegans where the majority of cells targeted for cell death have lineages from neuronal and glial cells. From there, ced-3 is localized to perinuclear regions of the cells. In order for ced-3 to become functional, it requires auto-catalytic cleavage which is initiated by ced-4, acting as an initiator caspase. Ced-3 gene is found downstream of ced-4 and positively regulates ced-3. It can also be indirectly inhibited by ced-9 and prevent apoptosis by inhibiting the function of ced-4 thus inhibiting the function of ced-3. The ced-3 ortholog in humans is caspase 9, an interleukin-1Œ≤ converting enzyme (ICE) and the ortholog in mice was found to be the Nedd-2 gene.  History  In 1986, the two researchers, Hilary Ellis and H. Robert Horvitz discovered that ced-3 and ced-4 genes were somehow involved in the apoptosis. Later on, in 2002, Sydney Brenner, H. Robert Horvitz, and John E. Sulston were awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their research in programmed cell death They were able to visualize the process of PCD using differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. During their research, Ellis, performed various experiments mutating the ced-3 gene and found that the cells encoding the mutated ced-3 gene all survived even though they were originally targeted for cell death. This led to the discovery of the ced-3 protein and its role in PCD; prior to the experiment, ced-3 was first thought to act as a repressor for the ced-1 gene. Ced-1 and ced-2 were the first ced genes to be initially discovered in 1983. In order for biologists to learn about PCD, they needed a model organism and this was first introduced by Sydney Brenner in 1974 with the nematode, C. elegans. This organism would serve as the subject of research for many years, leading to other biological discoveries, not only for C. elegans but for mammals as well.  Function  One of the main roles of the ced-3 protein in C. elegans is to help the development and growth of the organism. Without apoptosis, the cells that have been damaged or aged will not be able to be replaced with newer, healthier cells thus inducing growth. Targeted cells are fated to die at certain times and places during development which showed it is all part of a developmental plan. These cells once had a function that was necessary to the growth of the organism but later becomes useless and are targeted for elimination. Some other roles of programmed cell death include tissue homeostasis and disease prevention. If a cell is transformed or if its DNA has been damaged then the cell must be degraded before further damage can be done. In a recent study, it was found that for C. elegans in particular, programmed cell death is also found to be related to an immune system response to a pathogenic infection. By eliminating the infected cells, the nematode can ensure its survival against the attack. C. elegans also undergoes major anatomy changes that must be mediated by programmed cell deaths, and it was found that PCD is regulated by environmental conditions due to the fact that cell deaths were more commonly found in old, starving worms rather than new, healthy worms.  Ced-3 during apoptosis  During the process of apoptosis, the cell undergoes: * DNA fragmentation * Nucleus fragmentation * Disruption of cytoskeletal proteins * Golgi matrix protein fragmentation * Phagocytosis of neighbouring cells * Cytoplasm shrinkage As a wild-type protein, ced-3 will cleave other protein substrates within the cell and trigger apoptosis. In the nucleus, ced-3 cleaves DCR-1, so that the RNA can no longer be processed, and then it converts RNase into DNase thus promoting DNA degradation in the nucleus and mitochondrial elimination in the cytoplasm. Afterwards, ced-3 indirectly releases another protein, WAH-1, that can cause signals on the surface of the cell to be released so that the cell can be phagocytosed by a neighbouring cell.  Structure  In C. elegans, the ced-3 gene is found on chromosome 4 with an exon count of 8 and it is a protein expressed gene. The gene encodes for a caspase; more specifically, a cysteine-aspartate protease The gene is described as a \\"Cell death protein 3\\" and it is an ortholog to the mammalian version of the gene, caspase 9. Its name is derived from the term \\"cell death\\". Structurally, ced-3 has two protein domains: * CARD domain (Caspase recruitment domain) * Caspase domain CARD domains have protein-protein interactions where the CARD domain of both ced-3 and ced-4 are able to have homophilic interactions with each other. The caspase domain is the main domain of the protein, where the cleavage activity of the protease takes place. The active protease contains a large and small subunit where the large subunit is 17kDa and the small subunit is 15kDa in weight. Ced-3 consists of 2 isoforms, isoform a and isoform b. Isoform a has a transcript length of 2437 nucleotide (nt), 1512 nt coding sequence, and a 503 amino acid (aa) protein length. Isoform b has 864 nt transcript length, 864 nt coding sequence, and 287 aa protein length. The middle regions of the amino acid sequence is rich in serine residues, but these regions are not conserved for the ICE proteins in humans. Instead, the carboxy-terminal regions of the proteins are the most well conserved in both humans and mice.  Mechanism  Ced-3 genes are highly expressed in the mother of daughter cells that are targeted to die. The procaspase ced-3 gene produced in mother cells gets inherited to daughter cells where they are translated and activated. When the ced-3 gene is translated into a protein, it is first made into a precursor protein that needs to undergo modifications in order to become an active caspase. First, the active cysteine recognizes specific sequences containing aspartate and cleaves the aspartate which causes the C-terminal domain and the central polypeptides to heterodimerize to form the protease. This process is an autocatalytic process, meaning that the ced-3 protein cleaves itself in order to become functional. The remaining N-terminal domain is now called the prodomain and it is a part of the CARD domain but it is not a part of the cleaved protease. The prodomain gets recognized by ced-4 and consequently initiates ced-3 processing. Prior to this, apoptosis must be triggered by the increased gene expression of another protein known as the \\"death receptor\\", called EGL-1 protein. EGL-1 will then bind to and inhibit ced-9 which is an inhibitor caspase that recognizes and binds to ced-4 so that it can no longer activate ced-3. This causes a failure in apoptosis and the cell would continue live. These 4 proteins, including ced-3, are considered to make up the core apoptotic machinery which can also be found in orthologs of mammals. Once the ced-3 caspase is activated, the same cysteine residue of the protease goes and recognizes the amino acid aspartate, in other proteins, effectively cleaving them. These proteins are found in the nucleus, nuclear lamina, cytoskeleton, endoplasmic reticulum, and cytosol. The action of cleaving certain proteins instigate a series of pathways leading to the degradation of the cell.  Significance  Ced-3 is a critical part of the programmed cell death pathway which is a well known pathway for being associated with cancer, autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases in mammals. The discovery of the ced-3 function and mutations in C. elegans led to the understanding of how programmed cell death works in mammals. The C.elegans provided as a model organism that allowed researchers to compare the ortholog genes in the programmed cell death pathway. The ortholog of ced-3 gene is caspase 9 and its mutated form is involved in the origin of certain cancers and tumourous tissues. A mutation in the caspase gene can either cause the protein to be non-functional thereby allowing the cells to live and accumulate in the tissue or cause a DNA damaged protein to live and disrupt the body for further harm. This occurs commonly in the brain, leading to neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases.  Mutations  Various experiments were performed on C. elegans to determine the function of ced-3. Most of these experiments involved mutating the ced-3 gene and seeing how that affected the worm's development overall. With the loss of function mutations in the ced-3 gene, it was found that the somatic cells that were programmed to die were instead found alive. With missense mutations in the ced-3 gene, there was a decrease in ced-3 activation by ced-4 indicating that the prodomain was affected. A deletion mutation in the protease region of ced-3 also caused a decrease in the effectiveness of cell death activity. Then finally, with gain of function mutations, the worm was found with extra cells that were dead from the normal 131 cells.

He started his business at ‚ÄòDe Pepersteeg‚Äô and visited growers to sell ‚Äò‚Äôsparrietouw‚Äô‚Äô ( a type of rope used for crates and tarpaulins on Westland barges but also for bundling asparagus ). Later he added ‚Äò‚Äôkinnetjesnetten and bollenkinnetjes‚Äô‚Äô to his assortment. These ropes were knit to nets in Scheveningen, where Cor Brinkman himself brought them. In 1926 Brinkman won 1st prize on the great ‚ÄòFruit and Vegetable exhibition in Utrecht‚Äô with an electric sorting machine for tomatoes, ‚Äò‚Äôde doppenmachine‚Äô‚Äô. This improved version of the ‚Äò‚ÄôBrinkman Puncher‚Äô‚Äô became a huge success. The founders‚Äô son, Henk Brinkman, began hiring personnel. Cor Brinkman started at ‚Äòde Pepersteeg‚Äô (currently Havenstraat) in ‚Äôs-Gravenzande. The business grew really fast and moved in 1917 to the Market Place, known as the ‚Äò‚ÄôKousenhoek‚Äô‚Äô. Due to the great success the company had achieved, a new branch was opened in 1931. During the 2nd World War Brinkman experienced some serious problems. The '30s were a difficult period for the horticultural industry. On top of that the building in the Market Place was hit by a fierce fire. The car fleet (3 trucks), wood stock and machinery were lost. Founder Cor Brinkman‚Äôs grandson, Henk Brinkman (3rd generation), started as Managing Director in this difficult period. The nazi‚Äôs claimed Brinkman‚Äôs property in ‚Äôs-Gravenzande, therefore they were forced to move to the wood factory ‚Äò‚ÄôIn ‚Äôt Veld en de Jong‚Äô‚Äô. This new location in De Lier was used as headquarters. After a while, the seizure ended. Sorting machine 'Doppenmachine' 1921 During this difficult period Brinkman managed to rebuild everything. The horticultural industry revived after the war because of new growing methods, new crops, automation, irrigation pipes and heating systems. These were glory days for Brinkman. Important developments were the introduction of the Micom 85 horticulture computer ( advanced computer which controlled the climate in the greenhouse) and the switch from soil to cultivation. Brinkman initiated the cultivation of tomatoes, carnations and geberas in peat substrate. After that Grodan introduced cultivation on stone wool. Growers experienced a lot of benefits growing above ground, including the prevention of soil diseases, higher revenues, energy savings and surface optimization. Brinkman developed the Vocom, a computer that is able to dose water and fertilizers properly for the cultivation on substrate. These computers were a big hit in the '70s and '80s. Marketplace 1917 Brinkman moved in 1972 from ‚Äò‚ÄôKousenhoek‚Äô‚Äô to the former Auction Hall at the Woutersweg in ‚Äôs-Gravenzande. The grand opening of the new 45,000 m¬≤ property was a huge milestone for Brinkman and for Westland. Within five days more than 11,000 guests visited the new property. The headquarters are still located at the Woutersweg. Increasing demands from abroad led to the first branch in Burstwick, near Hull (UK) in 1972. Brinkman began exporting in 1930, to the UK.own archives  Predicate ‚ÄòRoyal‚Äô  On April 1, 1985, Brinkman received the ‚Äò‚ÄôRoyal‚Äô‚Äô predicate. In the name of the Dutch Queen Beatrix, Brinkman received this predicate for its 100th anniversary. Mies Bouwman awarded this Royal predicate to Cor Brinkman and Henk Brinkman. Elco Brinkman, at the time minister of the Dutch Government, congratulated Henk and Cor Brinkman personally (no family connection).

Career Knoten IVZeus Olympisches KomiteeLeidhold studied social sciences, philosophy and East Asian studies at the Ruhr University Bochum. His teachers included Norbert Elias, G√ºnter Gawlick, J√ºrgen Gebhardt, Leo Kofler, Eric Voegelin and Peter Weber- Sch√§fer. After his graduate degree with a thesis on Ren√© Descartes (unpublished) and studies at the Stanford University, CA, he received his doctorate in 1982 with a work on ‚ÄúEthics and Politics in Francis Hutcheson‚Äôs works‚Äù. From 1978 to 1992 he was Assistant at the University Erlangen. During the 1990s his research focused on International Relations, especially in cooperation with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP). Several research stays in the USA followed, among others at the Georgetown University and the University of Hawaii as well as in New Zealand, Australia and the South Pacific. Leidhold‚Äôs habilitation for the political sciences followed in 1989 with a thesis on ‚ÄúSecurity Policy related Problems in the Pacific Island Region‚Äù (1991).See also Andreas Holtz' reference to the work of Prof. Dr. W. Leidhold: Holtz, Andreas (2016): Regional Action in the Face of Global Turning Points and Regional Asymmetries, in: Holtz, Andreas, Kowasch, Matthias and Oliver Hasenkamp (eds): A region in transition, Politics and power in the Pacific Island countries, Saarbr√ºcken: universaar, pp. 47-106. After lectureships at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the Catholic University of Eichst√§tt-Ingolstadt he accepted a professorship at the University of Cologne in 1992. In 1997 Wolfgang Leidhold initiated and organized a prototype of ILIAS, the first Learning Management System, within the VIRTUS project at the Faculty of Management, Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Cologne. His dedication to the project was rewarded with the ILIAS speedwell in 2015. In 2001 Leidhold was awarded the Karl-Carstens- Preis for his remarkable accomplishments in giving a predominately young audience an understanding of the complex connections in modern security policy by means of an interactive simulation. Artistic activity From 1972 to 1975 Leidhold completed his artistic training under the supervision of painter Hans-J√ºrgen Schlieker. After group exhibitions in Bochum and his move to the University of Erlangen he continued his artistic engagement in Eberhard ‚ÄúPinsl‚Äù K√∂nigsreuther‚Äôs Studio. In his painting he developed a trans-historic metaphysic realism that combines artistic techniques, way of composition and coloring of the Renaissance with contemporary abstract formulations, whereby he picks up classical Themes in particular. His work was inspired by Duccio and Lorenzo Monaco as well as by Michelangelo and Raffael. In the modern era besides Carlo Carr√†, Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst and Willi Baumeister also Dubuffet and Cy Twombly played a role in Leidhold‚Äôs occupation with their mythological and metaphysical Themes. In addition, he assists the New York based Boris Lurie Art Foundation as a consultant in promoting the Jewish artist Boris Lurie. He initiated and coordinated two solo exhibitions of Boris Lurie's artwork and heritage at the NS-Documentation Center in Cologne (2014) and the Jewish Museum in Berlin (2016).See also Cilly Kugelmanns expression of gratitude for Prof. Dr. W. Leidhold's dedication to the project: Cilly Kugelmann, ed., No Compromises! The Art of Boris Lurie, Berlin (Kerber) 2016, p. 117. Theory Experience The plural term of experience and the criticism of the empiricism play a crucial role in Leidhold‚Äôs works. In his book ‚ÄúPolitical Philosophy‚Äù Leidhold defines experience as ‚Äúconscious reference‚Äù of something that is experienced to the experiencing subject and on this basis identifies five experiential dimensions: the experience of the senses, the imagination, the self-consciousness, the religious experience and the ‚Äúspeculative experience‚Äù or the power to reason. Because the structure of experience is not a culture-specific but universal phenomenon, Leidhold‚Äôs understanding of experience forms the foundation for an intercultural Hermeneutic. Religious experience and absent presence The distinctive feature of the religious experience according to Leidhold lies in its active reference through an ‚Äúabsent presence‚Äù as opposed to the experiencing subject. The ‚Äúabsent presence‚Äù, after Leidhold, is the source that refers to the Human (‚ÄúPresence‚Äù) without itself entering the horizon of the reference (‚Äúabsence‚Äù).See also Oliver Reis' reference to Prof. Dr. W. Leidholds thesis: Reis, Oliver (2012): Gott denken: Eine mehrperspektivische Gotteslehre. Berlin: LIT Verlag. Noetic turn By means of the criterion whether the particular structure of religious experience becomes transparent or not Leidhold distinguishes between the non-articulated and the articulated type of religious consciousness. As examples for the first type he names the cosmological myth of the ancient Egyptians or Sumerians, as examples for the second type he mentions religions that refer back to reputable originators, such as Zarathustra, Moses, Laozi or Buddha. The transition from the non- articulated type to the articulated type Leidhold terms the noetic turn. He demonstrates this phenomenon by means of extensive material in the field of history of ideas. Empiric metaphysics Counter to Wolff‚Äôs and Kant‚Äôs thesis that metaphysics are founded on the basis of pure reason, Leidhold develops empirically consolidated metaphysics. Simultaneously he carries out a radical change away from classical philosophy of being by considering time instead of being the highest concept. Person and ensemble Leidhold distinguishes in his view of the human between the fixed biological foundation (‚Äúhominity‚Äù) and the open existence as a person (‚Äúhumanity‚Äù). Due to the existence of man as a person that always stands in a communicative relation with others, the specific human type of cohabitation, according to Leidhold, is not the herd but the ‚Äúensemble‚Äù. This signifies the consciously formed, joint order, whose earliest type already occurs in the horde and develops its paradigmatic shape in the Greek polis. History of Experience In his current project on the history of experience, Leidhold examines both the structure of experience and how it has evolved from the Palaeolithic to the present, as well as its effects on the dynamics of cultures and political orders. His main thesis advocates a paradigm shift: the structure of experience changes in the course of human history. This thesis runs against the general consensus that regards the architecture of experience as a universal constant. In contrast, Leidhold identifies eight transformations of experiential structure (including the discovery of imagination and contemplation, of spiritual experience and the unconscious) that have developed in different regions at different times. He shows how the particular mix of experiential structures determines both the characteristics of cultures and their respective design of political order. This \\"history of experience\\" includes both an interdisciplinary theory of experience that combines neurological, philosophical-systematic and historical aspects‚Äîas well as a detailed intercultural analysis of historical material from the Palaeolithic up to the present.Leidhold, Wolfgang (2018).

Historically, the High Constables were charged with guarding the streets of Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, however today their duties are mostly ceremonial.https://www.edinburghhighconstables.org.uk/ Historically they formed part of the now defunct Corporation of the City of Edinburgh. Not to be confused with High Constables of the Palace of Holyroodhouse or the High Constabulary of the Port of Leith. History The High Constables of Edinburgh were founded by an Act of Parliament under James VI. Within Scotland the Lord High Constable was an officer of the Royal Household since at least c.1114. The officeholder deputised for the King of Scotland on military matters, and held a court - The High Court of Constabulary - in which the office holder was empowered to judge all cases of rioting, disorder, bloodshed and murder if such crimes occurred within four miles of the King, the King's Council, or the Parliament of Scotland. Other Constables were appointed with jurisdiction over various castles across the country. However, the lower level English Constables with jurisdiction over hundreds, villages and townships had not been introduced to Scotland; due to the nature of the Scottish landscape, order was maintained by Clan Chiefs and Feudal Lords. Constables had provided a civil guard in areas of England since 1285, when King Edward I of England passed the Statute of Winchester, with provisions which \\"constituted two constables in every hundred to prevent defaults in towns and highways\\", and by the 1600s, within local areas, a constable could be attested by two or more Justices of the Peace. After the union of the crowns in 1603 James VI of Scotland ascended to the throne of England. This resulted in a great cultural exchange, and the renewed fortunes of the City of Edinburgh as a trade centre with the Merchant Company of Edinburgh and the Incorporated Trades of Edinburgh. By 1611 with increased trade and occasional political disorder, The Kings Privy Council saw it necessary to implement a corps of guards, and ‚Äúcommand[ed] the magistrates of Edinburgh to appoint some persons to guard their streets and to commit to ward all person found on the streets after the said hour (ten hours bell). If in the taking of them any inconvenient sal happen it is declared that the same shall not be imputed as a crime to the captors but as good and acceptable service‚Äù.http://www.electricscotland.com/history/police/high_constables.htm Following many meetings of Edinburgh council, a number of constables were appointed - Half were merchants and half were craftsmen, and were charged with enforcing 16 regulations, relating to curfews, weapons and thefts.https://www.edinburghhighconstables.org.uk/history.html During the 17th Century, the Constables were issued with \\"short batons for their pockets\\", paid for from their fines. Over time the role of the society of High Constables changed, and they were forced to meet the evolving demands of law and order, attending executions, fires and riots. As the High Constables were principally respected gentlemen of the city, both merchants and in professions, there was concern that the increased demands made of them were unreasonable. In light of this the 1805 Edinburgh Police Act introduced a new police force designed to deal with the 'duties of watching over the peace of the metropolis'. In 1810 the constables were awarded the title of 'High Constables' to distinguish them from the other Edinburgh police force. The High Constables instead took on ceremonial duties, providing guards at the Edinburgh council, and parading for Royal visits. Traditions The body retains traditions of fining members for non attendance without a valid excuse and of inspecting the batons at the election of new constables. The uniform of the High Constables is that of morning dress, a black top hat, pinstripe grey trousers and a black morning coat and bears similarities to the uniform of the Cambridge University Constabulary in England. On non-ceremonial occasions High Constables may wear a lounge suit and bowler hat.https://www.edinburghhighconstables.org.uk/about/uniform.html The leader of the society of High Constables, known as the Moderator, wears a gold chain. Other officers also wear chains. The Treasurer carries a brass money box which was made in 1698. There are also large silver mounted batons for the use of Office Bearers Present day Today, the society serves as the official bodyguard to the Lord Provost, and continues to provide ceremonial guards at significant Edinburgh occasions.http://www.scotsman.com/news/historic-event- for-high-constables-1-884425 These include the Kirking of the Deacons and Riding of the Marches, the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo where they lead the Lord Provost's Platoon and the Edinburgh Hogmanay Celebrations.http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/high-praise-for-city-s-first- police-1-1776034 The constitution of the Society was modified in 1997 when the members agreed by a two thirds majority to permit women to become members. This was done at the request of the City of Edinburgh Council. The first lady member was elected in October of the following year.

Early life Narcissa Edith White Kinney, as a young girl Narcissa Edith White Kinney was born in Grove City, Pennsylvania, on July 24, 1854, the daughter of George Washington White (1812-1882) and Susannah Kerr Wallace (1815-1872). She was Scotch-Irish through ancestry. Her mother's maiden name was Wallace, and family records show that she was a direct descendant of Adam Wallace, who was burned in Scotland for his religion, and whose faith and death are recorded in Foxe's Book of Martyrs. At his death his two sons, David and Moses Wallace, fled to the north of Ireland, whence Narcissa's grandfather, Hugh Wallace, emigrated to America in 1796. Her father's ancestor, Walter White, was also burned during Queen Mary's reign, and the record is in Fox's Book of Martyrs, and four of her far-away grandfathers, two on each side of the house, fought side by side in the Battle of the Boyne. She was raised in a Conservative church, the United Presbyterian. Career Narcissa Edith White Kinney, A woman of the century Endowed as a teacher, having entered the profession before she was fifteen years old, it was natural enough that Narcissa Edith White Kinney should be recalled to her alma mater, the Edinboro State Normal School, as an instructor in the training department. She was also chosen at the same time superintendent of Edinboro Union School, Erie, Pennsylvania. Later she was engaged as a county institute instructor. Not until the fall of 1880 did she find her place in the white-ribbon rank. She brought to the work the discipline of a thoroughly drilled student and successful teacher. Her first relation to the Woman's Christian Temperance Union was as president of the local union in her town, Grove City, and next of her own county, Mercer, where she built up the work in a systematic fashion. Next she was made superintendent of normal temperance instruction for her State, and did an immense amount of thorough, effective work by lecturing, writing and pledging legislators to the hygiene bill after her arguments had won them to her view of the situation. Next to Mrs. Hunt, White was probably the ablest specialist in that department, having studied it carefully and attended the school of Col. Francis Wayland Parker, of Quincy, Massachusetts, to learn the best method of teaching hygiene to the young. In the autumn of 1884 White was sent by the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union to assist the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of Washington Territory in securing from the legislature the enactment of temperance laws. Under the persuasive eloquence and wise leadership of White the most stringent scientific temperance law ever enacted was passed by a unanimous vote of both houses. Also, in spite of the bitter opposition of the liquor traffic, a local-option bill was passed, submitting to the vote of the people in the following June the prohibition of the liquor traffic in each precinct. White assisted in that campaign and had the gratification of seeing prohibition approved by a majority vote of all the citizens, both men and women, of the Territory. In 1890 she was prostrated by the death of both her children in infancy. She recovered her health, and in 1891 she undertook the work of organizing a Chautauqua Association for the State of Oregon, in which she succeeded. She served as secretary of the association. Her husband, who owned a popular temperance seaside resort, gave the association grounds and an auditorium that cost $2,500.00 ($2,500.00 in 1914 had the same buying power as $60,358.00 in 2017). The first meeting of the new Chautauqua Assembly of Oregon was held in August 1891. Kinney liberally supported the Chautauqua movement in Oregon, having contributed about $6,000.00 to the work. Personal life White met Marshall Johnston Kinney (1847-1932), a prominent merchant of Astoria, Oregon, during her lecture tours on behalf of the WCTU. She married Kinney, owner at the time of the largest salmon cannery in the world, in 1888, and relocated to Astoria. She died on January 5, 1901, and is buried at River View Cemetery (Portland, Oregon).
