The bridge is used by 50,000 vehicles per day and carries six lanes of traffic, U-Bahn tracks, two footpaths, two cyclepaths and two utility tunnels. History The first bridge to be built on the site of the current Reichsbr√ºcke was constructed in 1872‚Äì1876 under the name Kronprinz-Rudolph- Br√ºcke (Crown Prince Rudolf Bridge), before the regulation of the Danube in Vienna. A truss of iron girders spanned the main river, with vaulted bridges crossing the flood plains on either side. It was formally opened on 21 August 1876, and the name was changed to Reichsbr√ºcke in 1919 after Austria became a republic. As a measure to reduce the level of unemployment in the 1930s, a suspension bridge was planned to take the place of the old Reichsbr√ºcke. The technical plans were drawn up by the architects Siegfried Thei√ü and Hans Jaksch, with artistic control being given to Clemens Holzmeister. The pillars of the old bridge were extended downstream and the structure was shifted by 26 m in less than seven hours. The new bridge could thus be built on the line of the old bridge without long-lasting disruptions to traffic. This suspension bridge, built between 1934 and 1937, carried four lanes of traffic, two tram lines and footpaths on both sides. The bridges over the flood plains were also expanded. The new bridge was opened on 10 October 1937 by Cardinal Innitzer and Bundespr√§sident Wilhelm Miklas. During the Second World War, the Reichsbr√ºcke was the only one of Vienna's bridges over the Danube not to suffer serious damage. The Soviet troops attacking the city were in time to prevent the bridge being destroyed by the defending Wehrmacht, and as a result, the bridge was renamed Br√ºcke der Roten Armee (Red Army Bridge) for a while. The bridge was renovated between 1948 and 1952. In 1948, the bridge was used as a location in the film The Third Man. = Reichsbr√ºcke collapse = Sightseers after the collapse in 1976. On 1 August 1976, shortly before 05:00, the bridge collapsed, killing one person. The main reason for the collapse was determined to be a structural failure in the bearings, which was not spotted during inspection due to the massive granite mantle that surrounded them. One lorry was destroyed and several ships damaged. The driver of an empty city bus was able to save himself, and his bus was salvaged and continued to be used until 1989; it now resides in Vienna's tramway museum (Stra√üenbahnmuseum). Shipping was diverted through the Donaukanal. Two supplementary bridges were hurriedly raised to carry the traffic and the trams, and were in use for four years. An international competition was launched for the design of the new bridge, and was won by Johann Nestroy. Construction began in 1978, and the bridge was formally opened on 8 November 1980 by city councillor Heinz Nittel, under the name Johann-Nestroy-Br√ºcke, a name which has not caught on. The Viennese U-Bahn network was routed over the Reichsbr√ºcke for the first time on 3 September 1982, after extensive testing. In 2003, the periphery of the bridge was overhauled, together with the lighting, and the footpaths and cyclepaths were widened. At the same time, the width of lanes was increased by reducing the width of the central reservation and removing the narrow emergency sidewalks. A German passenger ship rammed one pillar of the Reichsbr√ºcke in 2004, severely injuring several people. The bridge was undamaged by the accident. On Saturday 9 July 2005, the 25th anniversary of the building of the Reichsbr√ºcke was celebrated, and the restoration was finished. The tarmac was treated with a special noise-absorbing layer, and three new night bus stops were built. The bridge contains the Donauinsel station of the Vienna U-Bahn.

Retrieved 7 September 2011. where he gained his first two degrees. His international reputation as a composer developed from his early career as a programme maker at the BBC, during which he produced many award-winning programmes and developed a style known for its direct connection with audiences. His close association with the BBC Philharmonic resulted in three large-scale commissions for voices and orchestra. His \\"Son of God Mass\\" has had many performances worldwide, especially in the US and Europe. In 2005, The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra with the Choir of Clare College Cambridge, under Leonard Slatkin, premiered his largest choral work Annelies, a setting of the Diary of Anne Frank, at London's Cadogan Hall to wide critical acclaim. The work was later re-scored in an alternative chamber version which was premiered in The Netherlands on Anne Frank's 80th birthday by the British violinist Daniel Hope and the American soprano Arianna Zukerman. He wrote a number of works for the late British tenor Robert Tear, with whom he also collaborated as librettist, including a festal setting of the Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis for King's College, Cambridge, a cantata for the St Endellion Festival and three Christmas carols. Other major works include the choral work Luminosity, scored for choir, viola, organ, tanpura and percussion and The Seven Heavens for choir and orchestra, which portrays the life of C.S.Lewis in the imagery of the medieval planets. The Seven Heavens was premiered at the Ulster Hall with the Belfast Philharmonic and the Ulster Orchestra. Since 2006 his compositions have been performed in several major concerts devoted to his music at Westminster Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey with whom he continues to have a close association. In 2010 the Oxford-based chamber choir Commotio released a disc of his choral music on the Naxos label, Luminosity, which attracted much attention especially in the USA. In 2011, The Williamson Voices released the second Naxos choral disc, Living Voices with the Saxophonist Jeremy Powell, and Organist Ken Cowan under conductor James Jordan. 2013 saw the release on Naxos of Annelies, with Arianna Zukerman, The Lincoln Trio, Bharat Chandra and the Westminster Williamson Voices under James Jordan. Television credits include music for the BBC's coverage of the Queen Mother's funeral, and major BBC series Son of God. Among many international awards and achievements, he has earned three GRAMMY nominations (including Best Choral Performance for Annelies) and a Royal Television Society Award. He is Senior Research Fellow of St. Stephen's House, University of Oxford, and is a member of Oxford's Faculty of Music. In April 2020, he was appointed Director of Music at St Edmund Hall, Oxford. = Career highlights = * 2000 ‚Äì winner of Sandford St Martin Premier Award (with poet Michael Symmons Roberts) for Pika. * 2001 ‚Äì A Finer Truth ‚Äì debut album of choral works sung by Clare College Choir Cambridge ‚Äì released by Et'cetera. * 2001 ‚Äì orchestral score of multi award-winning BBC1 series Son of God. * 2002 ‚Äì Living Voices premiered in New York concert on the first anniversary of 9/11. * 2004 ‚Äì set prayer by Desmond Tutu for the Commonwealth Observance, Westminster Abbey. * 2005 ‚Äì movements from Annelies performed at the National Holocaust Commemoration, Palace of Westminster. * 2005 ‚Äì World premiere of Annelies given in London with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Leonard Slatkin. * 2007 ‚Äì U.

It is situated on the banks of Johor River. It was once a thriving port and the old capital of the Johor Sultanate. History Johor Lama is located near the site of the former capital of the Johor Sultanate, Kota Batu, which was established by Alauddin Riayat Shah II shortly after the fall of the Sultanate of Malacca in 1511. Kota Batu was sacked and burnt by the Acehnese in 1564, and Alauddin was taken to Aceh and killed. The capital was then moved to Bukit Seluyut for a few years. In the early 1570s, the sultan Ali Jalla returned to the Kota Batu area and reestablished the capital at Johor Lama. The Johor Sultanate had initially formed an alliance with the Portuguese against the Acehnese, however Ali Jalla confiscated the cargo of a Portuguese ship that had wrecked on the mouth of the Johor River. In response, the Portuguese stopped traders from Melaka from trading with Johor. Ali Jalla then forced ships to go Johor Lama, and attacked Melaka in January 1587. In retaliation, the Portuguese blockaded the Johor River, and later in the year led by Dom Paulo Lima de Pereira, launched an attack on Johor Lama. The fortified city was defended by 12,000 men, but the Portuguese prevailed and destroyed the fort. The capital of Johor was then moved to Batu Sawar further up the Johor River. Johor Lama was later rebuilt but again destroyed in 1604 by the Portuguese. For some time it continued to be used as a port for larger ships where goods could then be moved upstream to towns such as Batu Sawar.

Its hospitals include a 690-bed academic medical center (WVU Hospitals, Inc., or \\"J.W. Ruby Memorial Hospital\\" in Morgantown, WV), four community hospitals (United Hospital Center in Bridgeport, WV; Camden Clark Medical Center in Parkersburg, WV; Berkeley Medical Center in Martinsburg, WV; and Reynolds Memorial Hospital in Glen Dale, WV), three critical access hospitals (St. Joseph's Hospital in Buckhannon, WV; Jefferson Medical Center in Ranson, WV; and Potomac Valley Hospital in Keyser, WV), and a children's hospital (WVU Medicine Children's in Morgantown, with satellite clinics across the state). The health system's flagship academic medical center also has a variety of clinical and operational affiliations with dozens of hospitals across the West Virginia- Pennsylvania-Maryland region, including Wetzel County Hospital in New Martinsville, WV; Davis Health System in Elkins, WV; and Garrett Regional Medical Center in Oakland, MD. The health system has more than 1,000 active medical staff members and 1,450 beds. The faculty practice plan and the School of Medicine have 410 residents, 38 ACGME-accredited programs, and 12 special fellowships. The faculty practice also operates several clinics across West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.  General background  In 1960, West Virginia University, located in Morgantown, West Virginia, commenced operations of a tertiary care teaching hospital as a component of the medical center of the University. In 1984, the West Virginia Legislature adopted legislation that authorized separation of the hospital operations from the University and the establishment of a separate corporate entity. West Virginia University Hospitals, Inc. was incorporated as a non-stock, not-for- profit corporation and, by an agreement of transfer and lease dated July 1, 1984, assumed the operation of and responsibility for the hospital. The existing, 690-bed hospital serves as a major statewide and regional health care referral center, and provides the principal clinical education and research site for West Virginia University. The hospital's original facility, constructed in 1960, is now the WVU Health Sciences Building and serves as the central academic teaching facility for WVU. Ownership of this facility resides with the State of West Virginia. In 1986, West Virginia University Hospitals, Inc. began construction of its current facility, J.W. Ruby Memorial Hospital, a 10-story, facility that began operating in 1988. The J.W. Ruby Memorial Hospital is a tertiary care referral center and serves as the principal clinical education and research site for the WVU School of Medicine. As part of its 690-bed complement and within its existing contiguous facility, the Hospital operates a 119-bed Children's Hospital. However, in November 2017, the leadership of WVU Medicine announced plans to build a 10-story, 150-bed Children's Hospital on the main medical campus in Morgantown. The broader health system, now known as the West Virginia University Health System, formed in 1996 with J.W. Ruby Memorial Hospital and United Hospital Center as the original two hospital members. Since then, the health system has grown mostly through acquisitions or clinical affiliation agreements. West Virginia University Health System, which operates under the brand \\"WVU Medicine,\\" has since become West Virginia's largest employer and healthcare provider. Collectively, WVU Medicine operates in all but 14 of West Virginia's 55 counties, and has clinics in Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland.

Part I was first broadcast on the British television channel BBC2 on 18 February 1999 while Parts II and III were broadcast on 25 February and 4 March respectively. The plot involves the re-introduction of Red Dwarf as nanobots have rebuilt the ship and the original crew are resurrected. The three parts were written by Doug Naylor and directed by Ed Bye. Plot =Part 1= In a cell, Lister and Rimmer are having another furious argument. We are then shown the circumstances that led to their incarceration... Three days earlier, Kryten's nanobots had rebuilt Red Dwarf, but done so far too large. Lister enters the cockpit showing off his now non-muscular body and it emerges that the enlargement is a temporary symptom of the nanobots' restoration process as it soon turns out that Red Dwarf is shrinking around Starbug. Suddenly the ship is sucked into an air vent. With Red Dwarf almost completely shrunk, the corridors rip off Starbug's rear and middle section before the cockpit is sent flying into a cargo bay where it crash lands, and the crew manage to escape mere seconds before it explodes. The crew are approached by two figures recognised by Lister... Selby and Chen. The nanobots haven't only restored Red Dwarf but also its crew. Captain Hollister then arrives with a security officer who places Lister under arrest for stealing and crashing a Starbug, flying without a pilot's licence and bringing two stowaways (Cat and Kryten) aboard. Everyone is placed in custody and Lister is confined to quarters. He then asks Holly (who is still loaded into Lister's watch and therefore hidden from Red Dwarf's crew) what will happen if they're found guilty. Holly explains that they'll get two years in the brig. Lister is confused as Red Dwarf doesn't have a brig, but Holly explains that there is a top-secret prison facility contained aboard the ship holding hundreds of inmates who were being transported to a containment facility. Unfortunately, they have all been resurrected too. Just as he thinks things can't get any worse, Rimmer enters the bunkroom. However this is not the Rimmer that left Starbug to take on his Ace persona, but rather the Rimmer that was aboard Red Dwarf before the accident that wiped out the crew. Lister tells Rimmer the whole story and asks for help escaping. In exchange, he offers Rimmer a copy of the crew's personal and confidential files that exist on Starbug. Rimmer initially refuses, until Lister tells him that with the information he can get the promotion to officer status like he's always wanted. Rimmer agrees and Lister gives him his watch which Holly has been loaded into. The Cat & Kryten are taken for medical and psychiatric evaluation. Unfortunately, Kryten's erratic personality doesn't go over well, and he is recommended to be restored to his factory settings. Aboard the burnt out wreckage of Starbug's cockpit, Rimmer finds the disc with the crew's files. He also finds two strange tubes that are the positive viruses that Lister picked up from a deranged scientist years earlier. Rimmer quickly tries out sexual magnetism, and walks down the corridor where all the women admire him. Rimmer notes to himself that \\"the world loves a bastard\\". =Part 2= Lister, Kochanski, Kryten and the Cat are brought before a board of enquiry, and Captain Hollister requests their permission to use psychotropic testing during their trial. The four agree and Captain Hollister asks them to sign a letter of consent each and place them in envelopes provided. Later Kryten is taken away for a physical examination and, due to his lack of a penis, is classified as a woman. They also offer Kryten a deal: if he agrees to undergo a system restoration then the charges against him will be dropped. Kryten doesn't want to say yes, but can't say no to superior officers. Kochanski tells Kryten to imagine the officers sitting on the toilet to help him. Kryten finds it works, then imagines Kochanski sitting on a toilet for his own amusement. Later, Rimmer visits Captain Hollister with a report detailing the dangers of loose drive plates. Hollister is impressed by the in-depth report, and Rimmer (using information from the confidential reports) continues by giving Hollister one of his favourite foods snaffled from the cargo deck and some pile cream. Hollister gives Rimmer an envelope and asks him to post it. Rimmer seals the envelope before noticing that it is addressed to him. Hollister tells Rimmer that he is inviting him to the Captain's Table that evening. Rimmer can't believe how well the scheme is working and visits Lister in his cell. However Rimmer has decided to end the deal to help Lister escape, and has copied the confidential reports, meaning Lister doesn't have to supply him with the information. Rimmer then tells Lister that he has the positive viruses and intends to use them. He leaves, but doesn't realise that Lister has managed to expose himself to the luck virus, which he uses to guess the codes needed to escape the cell. Kryten is asked for his decision regarding getting his corrupted systems repaired, and the mechanoid still can't say no. In order to give him the courage, he steals a security guard's gun and (taking Kochanski's advice too seriously) forces the superior officers present to sit on toilets. Amused by this, Kryten finally refuses to have his systems restored; however, his actions have caused the crew to decide to proceed anyway. Afterwards, Kryten has been returned to his old ways of servitude and politeness. Lister breaks Kochanski out of her quarters and, while in the lift, decides to make the most of the opportunity to try out the sexual magnetism virus on himself. Although it works at first and Kochanski practically throws herself at her ex-boyfriend, she returns to normal after a few seconds and Lister realises that the positive viruses cancel each other out. Later, after getting the Cat released, the three look for Kryten so they can all escape only to discover that he doesn't recognise them and has returned to his factory settings. Lister, Kochanski and the Cat start looking for a new disguise (since the Cat refuses to wear his over his normal clothes). Suddenly Cat hits on a great idea... with black mop heads and fake teeth with overbites they can pretend to be the Dibbley family. At dinner, Rimmer has taken the sexual magnetism virus in a very large dose and charms everyone. While the women look at him adoringly, Rimmer impresses Hollister with his theories on future echoes and universes where time runs backward. Rimmer soon finds the sexual magnetism virus isn't so great, as every time he gets up to fetch refreshments a female guest follows him and forces him to have sex with her. Lister, Kochanski and Cat are bluffing their way past the crew with their geeky disguises and claims to be computer programmers when they run into Kryten again, who begins to recognise them. Knowing that recognising them will cause him to feel happy while also exposing them to the danger of being discovered, Kryten feels ambivalence, an emotion he was trying to master before. This undoes the system restoration and he turns back to normal. The four continue their escape from the ship. After yet another sexual encounter, Hollister discusses the psychotropic testing he's conducting on the others and reveals that Lister and the others merely believe they are escaping when they are really in an artificial reality where their actions are being monitored. Rimmer realises that Lister could end up mentioning the deal they had regarding the confidential files and land him in a heap of trouble, excuses himself and scrambles to the AR suite. On his journey, he decides to try to regain some of his self-control and injects his groin with anaesthetic. It spreads to his left leg, however, and he is forced to hobble to the AR suite while the female crew still admire him. =Part 3= Lister, Kryten, Kochanski and the Cat make it (or rather, they think they've made it) to a holding bay and sneak aboard a Blue Midget; however, the attractive controller tells the Cat he needs clearance. In order to prove that he is capable of handling the ship, as well as impressing the woman, he begins an impromptu dance routine with Blue Midget as his partner. Amazingly, this ploy works and the flight controller agrees to a date with the Cat who is more than ready to stay behind and get ready before Lister forces them to leave. Rimmer reaches the Artificial Reality suite and blackmails the officer on duty (using the confidential information) into leaving. In the simulation, the crew begin their search for the nanobots. Lister then begins to discuss the deal he made with Rimmer; however, Rimmer begins to edit out all mention of his name and the agreement. The crew in the simulation notice the jumps in their actions and conversation and realise that the whole escape attempt is a simulation designed to test their responses (having been knocked out when they licked the envelopes at the earlier hearing). Lister realises that they've actually proved their innocence, as they have indeed been trying to track down the nanobots who resurrected the crew. Rimmer, desperate to protect himself, then begins more edits to make Lister and the others seem guilty. Deciding they need to get out of the simulation, the crew search for the emergency exit which is hidden by a cryptic clue. Amazingly, the Cat is the one to work out that the button marked 'E-Eleven-T' is the trap door (as eleven is XI in Roman numerals). Pressing the button, the four then find themselves as plasticine characters trapped in the simulation's screen saver. The Cat once again finds the emergency exit, and the four leave again. The crew wake in the AR suite to find Rimmer trying furiously to place them back inside; however, he is quickly on the run as the sexual magnetism virus causes Kochanski to lust after him. Hobbling to the lift, Rimmer is protected from her advances by the others while Lister tells him that taking the luck virus will cure the sexual magnetism virus. Thanks to this, Rimmer, his leg and an embarrassed Kochanski are returned to normal. The crew are now forced to take Rimmer with them as they make a real escape attempt. The five make it to Blue Midget and once again a flight controller demands clearance, and this one is far from attractive. The Cat decides to forgo the dance and Blue Midget leaves the ship in a hurry. While making plans to pick up supplies from the SS Einstein, talk turns to the Theory of relativity. Naturally Holly is unable to recall what it actually means, but takes offence at being labelled an idiot and reveals that he created the nanobots that resurrected the crew! He explains that ever since he brought Lister out of stasis, he has had one directive: to keep Lister sane, which he does by finding distractions and ways to keep him occupied. Everyone is shocked that Holly nearly got them thrown in the brig, but Holly tells them they still might end up there... everyone is still in Artificial Reality and so is Rimmer. From his office, Hollister discusses the events with the original version of Holly who has an IQ of 6,000. It turns out that Hollister suspected Rimmer of being in league with Lister and the others when he came to his office with so much knowledge and had him lick one of the psychotropic envelopes when he invited him to the Captain's table. Lister and the others are found not guilty of the charges against them based on their actions in the AR Suite... but now have a new charge brought against them; using confidential information for their own gain. Of this, everyone is found guilty and are sentenced to two years in the brig. The five are released from AR and realise they still have the positive viruses (since they haven't really been used), only for Hollister to confiscate the luck virus to send for testing. As they are photographed in their prison uniforms, Holly realises that he's buggered up again. Below, the crew are welcomed by Warden Ackerman to 'The Tank'. While this is going on, Lister, still in possession of the sexual magnetism virus, empties the tube over Rimmer as revenge for his actions earlier. Rimmer then realises that he's becoming very popular with the male inmates. Production For series VIII, Doug Naylor returned to Red Dwarf's roots and he would write the majority of the series himself. Paul Alexander, whose episodes \\"Stoke Me a Clipper\\" and \\"Epideme\\" were well received, returned as script supervisor. The inspiration for the new series came about during Naylor's work on the remastering of series I to III. The classic bunk setup and the character of Captain Hollister in those early episodes proved to be a deciding factor in reviving the crew. The opening episode was originally planned as an hour-long special. This would give the show the opportunity to introduce the new setup. However, the episode overran and the opener turned into a three-part story. Having the crew revived meant having the original actors back. Mac McDonald reprised his Captain Hollister character; Paul Bradley and David Gillespie returned as Lister's drinking buddies. Andy Taylor played Counsellor McClaren, the ship's psychiatrist, Karl Glenn Stimpson played MP Thornton, and Kika Mirylees appeared as CMO Karen Newton. Red Dwarf, the ship itself, also returned, having not been seen since series V's penultimate feature, \\"Demons and Angels\\". A new, much larger model had been created for the Red Dwarf Remastered project, though it ended up being too difficult to film because of its size. As a result, the model was used as a template for a CGI version of the ship, which was used not only for the Remastered project, but also Series VIII. The large model was later modified, and finally seen on-screen in Red Dwarf X. With Kryten having been defaulted to his factory settings, posh English accent and all, it was considered that David Ross could make a return. Ross had first played the character in the Series II episode \\"Kryten\\" as a guest part prior to Llewellyn taking over in Series III, and he had also played Talkie Toaster in the Series IV episode \\"White Hole\\". In the end, Robert Llewellyn impersonated the accent. Ross would later return to the series reprising his role of Talkie in the Series XII episode \\"Mechocracy\\" aired in 2017. One of the most difficult scenes to film was the Blue Midget/Cat dance sequence. The entire dance sequence was filmed first with green screen backdrop. It was then edited with no effects, then the Midget would be added to match the movements of the scene. The scene marked the return of Blue Midget after last being seen in series III's \\"Bodyswap\\". In terms of true-series continuity, this marks the first appearance of the new CGI re-design of the ship.

The song was remixed and released as a single on 4 October 1975 in the United States, and on 18 October 1975 in the United Kingdom. The song peaked at number 41 in the UK and number 39 in the US. Recording The song was recorded late in 1974 at Abbey Road Studios, before the band went to New Orleans to record the majority of Venus and Mars. It was one of only three songs recorded for the album with short- term Wings drummer Geoff Britton before he quit the band (the others being \\"Love in Song\\" and \\"Medicine Jar\\"). Lyrics Like many of Paul McCartney's songs of this period, the subject of \\"Letting Go\\" is his wife Linda. The singer describes himself in a relationship with a beautiful woman but he remains concerned about the relationship. McCartney biographer Peter Ames Carlin claims that the song \\"traced the thin line between love and obsession\\", with \\"passion in all its unhinged, dangerous glory.\\" The song reflects McCartney's recognition that he needed to give his wife more space to pursue her own interests, after Linda had given up her career as a photographer to join his band. The content of the lyrics varies between the verses and refrain, with the verses describing the subject and the refrain acknowledging the idea of \\"letting go.\\" The key is A minor at the start of the song, but the song ends in C minor. The contrast in the lyrics is also reflected in the music, with the refrain using a descending note melody and having a darker sound than the verses, which have a melody that wavers up and down. The song uses a medium tempo, and the instruments include a guitar part described by Allmusic critic Donald Guarisco as \\"bluesy\\" and keyboards, plus a horn parts in an interlude as well as in the outro. \\"Letting Go\\" has more of a soul music feel than most of the songs on Venus and Mars, which are more pop music oriented. Billboard Magazine described it as being one of Wings' \\"less surrealistic productions,\\" commenting on its \\"hymn-to-nature\\" lyrics and \\"vaguely omninous minor chord progression.\\" The single version is remixed and is approximately a minute shorter than the album track. The single also incorporates elements that were not included on the album track, such as an organ glissando at the beginning. Critical reception Ultimate Classic Rock contributor Nick DeRiso rated \\"Letting Go\\" to be Wings' 10th greatest song, praising its \\"dark, roiling tone\\" and how it \\"explores that narrow space between love and obsession to great effect.\\" Chip Madinger and Mark Easter called it \\"one of the best songs on the LP.\\" Robert Rodriguez called it \\"a strong track topped with a full slab of brass\\" and noted that it was \\"one of the Wings' onstage highlights.\\" Authors Roy Carr and Tony Tyler described the song as one of the few \\"genuinely potent\\" tracks on Venus and Mars but with respect to the single declare that McCartney \\"should have taken his advice and let go. This seeks to be composedly heavy but merely succeeds in attaining a considerable degree of ponderosity.\\" In the book The Rough Guide to the Beatles, Chris Ingham considered \\"Letting Go\\" to be \\"an inert sludge rocker,\\" calling it \\"a disastrous choice for a single.\\" Live performances The song was performed during the Wings over America tour in 1976, and was included on the live album Wings over America and on the concert film, Rockshow. Larry Rohter of The Washington Post described the performance on Wings Over America as \\"rollicking\\" and \\"exciting.\\" Ben Fong-Torres described McCartney's live performance of the song as \\"reaching back for some of that Little Richard inspiration.\\" Ultimate Classic Rock critic Nick DeRiso said that it \\"is shot through with this jagged sexuality.\\" McCartney played it again during his 2010 Up and Coming Tour and his 2016 One on One tour. A previously unreleased mix of the song was offered as a free download through Lauren Laverne's Radio 6 Music show on 29 October 2014. Covers \\"Letting Go\\" has been covered by Ian Mitchell on the album Garage Band Tribute To the Beatles. In 2014 the song was covered by Heart on The Art of McCartney covers album. Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes this version as laying into the song's \\"spooky heart.\\" References 1975 singles Paul McCartney songs Wings (band) songs Songs written by Paul McCartney Capitol Records singles Song recordings produced by Paul McCartney Songs written by Linda McCartney Music published by MPL Music Publishing Heart (band) songs 1974 songs ","title":"Letting Go (Wings song)"},{"id":"5759451","text":"Bust a Nut is the fourth studio album by U.S. hard-rock band Tesla, released in 1994.

He is one of the most successful basketball coaches in Europe, having won league titles with practically all the clubs he trained; including four EuroLeague titles with three clubs (Jugoplastika, Limoges, and Panathinaikos). In 2008, he was named one of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors. His daughter Marina is a Serbian professional basketball coach, currently coaching Serbia women's national team. Early life Born in Otoƒçac within the region of Lika to Serb parents hailing from villages in the vicinity of nearby Brinje, eight-year-old Maljkoviƒá's parents moved the family to Kraljevo due to his Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) officer father getting reassigned there. Maljkoviƒá was an avid cyclist in his youth;Interview: Bo≈æa Maljkoviƒá;Playboy, April 2011 he took up basketball at the age of 12, playing the shooting guard position at KK Sloga. Assessing his own playing skills, Maljkoviƒá later said: \\"I had a decent shot, but no defensive skills. As a coach I would never pick Maljkoviƒá the player in any serious team\\".Maljkoviƒá o nema≈°tini, kƒáerci, Kukoƒçu, devojkama... ;Politika, October 2009 A few years later, in the mid-1960s, the family moved to Belgrade, settling in an apartment in the newly built \\"≈†est kaplara\\" housing development for the JNA officers' families, located in New Belgrade's Blok 21 adjacent to the U≈°ƒáe neighbourhood. During his time in \\"≈†est kaplara\\", teenage Maljkoviƒá was neighbours with water polo players Mirko Sandiƒá and Zoran Jankoviƒá who were prominent VK Partizan and Yugoslav national team members at the time. Coaching career Having ended his playing career prematurely at only 19 years of age, Maljkoviƒá immediately began coaching at U≈°ƒáe, newly established basketball outfit from the eponymous Belgrade neighbourhood. Maljkoviƒá is among the four people who founded the fledgling club in 1971 on the initiative of local communist authorities from the New Belgrade municipality. Reportedly, the catalyst to set up a new, community-based basketball activity was a gruesome murder in the U≈°ƒáe neighbourhood that saw a local resident murder his own son; the shock throughout the community prompted the local authorities into establishing a basketball club in order to provide the neighbourhood youngsters with a creative outlet. The murder came on the heels of a general increase in criminality in the 12,000-resident U≈°ƒáe local community that mostly consisted of recently arrived families of the Yugoslav People's Army officers and personnel from all over SFR Yugoslavia; this local spike in crime only sped up the process of establishing a basketball club as means of channeling the energy of the local youth into something positive. Maljkoviƒá, himself a young man, began coaching the club in 1971. In parallel to coaching basketball, Maljkoviƒá enrolled at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Law though he never graduated. Working in extremely modest circumstances without regular access to a gym and with mostly outdoor practices in U≈°ƒáe park, the club still managed to gain multiple promotions and jump several ranks of competition. In 1977, Maljkoviƒá took a coaching offer from the Crvena zvezda youth system, becoming head coach of the club's junior team. =Radniƒçki Belgrade= In 1979, noticing Maljkoviƒá's dedication and enthusiasm both at U≈°ƒáe and Red Star, established head coach Bata ƒêorƒëeviƒá invited the 27-year- old across town to be his assistant at Radniƒçki Belgrade, another Belgrade club that much like KK U≈°ƒáe started out as a community-based operation in the city neighbourhood of Crveni Krst. Seeing Radniƒçki had been playing in the First Federal League (top tier on the Yugoslav basketball pyramid), Maljkoviƒá jumped at the opportunity. The club was also only six years removed from its biggest success ‚Äî 1973 national league title. In the years following their domestic title, they additionally put together memorable European campaigns, reaching the 1973‚Äì74 FIBA European Champions Cup semifinal as well as 1976‚Äì77 FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup final. Despite being in constant shadow of the city giants Crvena zvezda and Partizan, Radniƒçki nevertheless managed to carve out a place for itself on the Yugoslav basketball map, establishing an identity of a scrappy small club regularly punching above its weight. 1979‚Äì80 season: assistant to Bata ƒêorƒëeviƒá In Maljkoviƒá's first season at Radniƒçki as ƒêorƒëeviƒá's assistant, the club finished with a 9‚Äì13 record, placing 10th in the 12-team league thus barely avoiding relegation. It also experienced major budgetary problems with its main financial backers, state- owned iron foundry factory Fabrika odlivaka Beograd (FOB), cutting their sponsorship. At one point Maljkoviƒá, who temporarily quit his law studies, said he did not receive a salary for five months.Maljkoviƒá interview;RTS, January 2013 1980‚Äì81 season: first top-level head coaching experience Continual financial struggles at the club affected it in various ways, including the departure of head coach ƒêorƒëeviƒá during summer 1980. Young Maljkoviƒá became his replacement, admitting to getting the position \\"not because I was somehow the best fit to lead this particular team, but simply because nobody else wanted the job\\".;RTS, January 2013 Playing their home games at Hala sportova, 28-year-old Maljkoviƒá's debut season as head coach in the First League brought no improvement for the club that finished with identical 9‚Äì13 record, good for 9th place this time. Maljkoviƒá's Radniƒçki, however, directly influenced the title race by beating Cibona late in the season (handing Cibona only its third loss that season) thus enabling their Hala co-tenants Partizan to take the championship by catching up to Cibona's 19‚Äì3 record and overtaking it at the top of the table due to better head-to- head record (this was before the playoff system was introduced in the league). 1981‚Äì82 season Maljkoviƒá stayed for the 1981‚Äì82 season as well, leading Radniƒçki one more time to its now customary 9‚Äì13 record. At the end of the season, the club saw another big exodus of its players and staff, including Maljkoviƒá, due to more sponsors backing out. Summing up his time with Radniƒçki, in 2013 Maljkoviƒá expressed \\"certain sadness all these years later due to feeling I could've done more with that team, something like what I managed with Jugoplastika later, but on a smaller scale, because we had a very talented group of young players along with some older ones\\".Maljkoviƒá interview;RTS, January 2013 =Six months in Stara Pazova= After Radniƒçki, during summer 1982 Maljkoviƒá took a head coaching offer from KK Lifam, a club from Stara Pazova playing in the Yugoslav First B League, the country's second-tier competition. He remained living in Belgrade and would drive out to Stara Pazova every morning for practices. =Ranko ≈Ωeravica's assistant at Crvena zvezda= With a bit of a coaching CV now behind him, Maljkoviƒá was approached in early 1983 by Crvena zvezda about joining their coaching staff as assistant to legendary coach Ranko ≈Ωeravica in addition to an offer of simultaneously leading the club's youth system. He took the job largely due to ≈Ωeravica's clout and authority in Yugoslav basketball despite advice from some colleagues who felt that taking an assistant job after being a head coach in the First League was a step backward career-wise. =Jugoplastika= Maljkoviƒá's big head coaching break would come at Jugoplastika, where he arrived in early summer 1986 on recommendation from Yugoslav basketball's universally revered elder statesman Aca Nikoliƒá who, having just recently retired from active coaching, took on an advisory role with the Split club. The young assistant coach was not the club's first choice as they initially wanted Vlade ƒêuroviƒá,;TVBN, May 2013 the hottest coaching commodity in Yugoslav basketball at the time having just led Zadar to the league championship. In demand ƒêuroviƒá, however, turned down the head coaching offer from Split, choosing the one from Crvena zvezda instead so after unsuccessfully courting a few more candidates Jugoplastika eventually turned to Maljkoviƒá who gladly accepted. The appointment of a young and unproven head coach was not without critics at Split, including some within the club such as 19-year-old center Dino Raƒëa who openly talked to the press about his displeasure with the hiring of Maljkoviƒá who in the young player's opinion \\"lacked head coaching experience\\". And it wasn't just Raƒëa questioning Maljkoviƒá's coaching credentials because the quiet consensus around Split at the time was that Jugoplastika is a potent squad loaded with young talent and as such needs an experienced coach to provide leadership, not someone still learning his craft. Jugoplastika ended the just completed 1985‚Äì86 league season in 6th spot (outside of the top four required to make the playoffs) following a turbulent campaign that started with Slavko Trniniƒá as head coach, before he got the sack due to poor results early on and got replaced with Zoran Slavniƒá. Freewheeling Slavniƒá initiated a squad overhaul by bringing younger players into the first team (including great 17-year-old prospect ‚Äì small forward Toni Kukoƒç who was equally adept at playing any other position) and giving them greater freedom on the court. This resulted in Jugoplastika ending the season with a 12‚Äì10 record that tied it with ≈†ibenka and Partizan, however due to worse head-to-head record against the two teams it ended in 6th spot and out of the playoffs, still good for a Koraƒá Cup berth next season. Despite clear improvement since his arrival Slavniƒá still left at the end of the season. 1986‚Äì87: building a future champion The young 34-year-old coach Maljkoviƒá thus took over a young squad with supremely talented Kukoƒç and Raƒëa as its biggest assets. Other prominent players on the team included the twenty-year-old shooting guard Velimir Perasoviƒá and twenty-two-year-old center Goran Sobin. Several older players such as Ivica Dukan left the club that summer. Maljkoviƒá's only summer acquisition of note was the twenty-two- year-old point guard Zoran Sretenoviƒá from Crvena zvezda where he wasn't getting much of a chance to play as backup to established national team player Zoran Radoviƒá; Maljkoviƒá knew the player and his situation at Red Star well, having spent a year coaching him there. Liking Sretenoviƒá's character qualities and believing in his basketball skills, Maljkoviƒá decided to give him a chance by bringing him in to be the team's primary playmaker, envisioning his role at Jugoplastika as the main distributor on offense for Kukoƒç and Raƒëa. Maljkoviƒá's decision to get Sretenoviƒá was second-guessed among the club's management who simply didn't know the player and were hoping for an established name. Under the tutelage of sixty-two-year-old professor Nikoliƒá who had finished his coaching career and now acted as a coaching consultant, Maljkoviƒá set about molding the obvious raw basketball talent this young squad possessed. In interviews with the local press, he identified lack of recognizable playing structure as the problem he wants the team to overcome. To that end, in stark contrast to his predecessor Slavniƒá, Maljkoviƒá insisted on strict discipline as well as frequent and exhausting training sessions, believing the sheer quantity of work put in will eventually yield results for Jugoplastika against its formidable Yugoslav League rivals such as reigning European champion Cibona led by 22-year-old Dra≈æen Petroviƒá, reigning league champion Zadar, young and up-and-coming Parizan, and experienced Crvena zvezda. Maljkoviƒá's first season in charge already provided some encouraging signs as Jugoplastika finished the league regular season with a 15‚Äì7 record, which was enough for the 3rd spot (behind 22‚Äì0 Cibona and 18‚Äì4 Partizan) and a playoff berth. The season in Europe was not as promising. Drawn in a round- robin group with Olympique Antibes, Divarese Varese, and FC Barcelona, Jugoplastika managed only two wins in its six games, finishing last and getting eliminated from the 1986‚Äì87 FIBA Koraƒá Cup at the very first hurdle. Back in the Yugoslav league, in the playoff semifinal best-of-3 series Jugoplastika lost 2‚Äì1 to Du≈°ko Vujo≈°eviƒá-coached Partizan led by youngsters Sa≈°a ƒêorƒëeviƒá, Vlade Divac, and ≈Ωarko Paspalj. In many ways the two teams mirrored one another ‚Äì they both had young head coaches who both took over their respective teams in the summer of 1986 while both teams also had a variety of young talent on their respective rosters. Maljkoviƒá and his Jugoplastika lost this battle to Vujo≈°eviƒá's Partizan, but it would prove to be only the first of many in the years to come. 1987‚Äì88: Yugoslav League champions During the summer 1987 off-season, Maljkoviƒá identified a need for more experience on the roster in order to make a deeper playoff run. He thus brought in Du≈°ko Ivanoviƒá, experienced small forward from Buduƒánost who was about to turn 30. Young Jugoplastika starlets Kukoƒç and Raƒëa were selected by the Yugoslav national team head coach Kre≈°imir ƒÜosiƒá for EuroBasket 1987 where the team took bronze after losing to Greece in the semis. Later that summer the two were picked again for national team duty, this time by the under-19 national team coach Svetislav Pe≈°iƒá for the Under-19 World Cup in Bormio. Yugoslav youth team steamrolled over the competition, including the USA team, with Kukoƒç dropping 11 three-pointers on them from 12 attempts. Coming back to Split for the club season start in the fall, team leaders Kukoƒç and Raƒëa were brimming with confidence and fitness. Jugoplastika started off the season tremendously, piling up wins in the Yugoslav League. Simultaneously, in Koraƒá Cup, they easily made it to the quarterfinal group featuring CAI Zaragoza, Hapoel Tel Aviv, and Arexons Cant√π, but lost all three of its away games for the 3‚Äì3 group record that wasn't good enough to progress to the semifinals. Back on the domestic league front, Jugosplastika continued its great run to finish the regular season 21‚Äì1. 1988‚Äì89: Euroleague champions, Yugoslav League title repeat During summer 1988, Maljkoviƒá brought in 20-year-old Luka Paviƒáeviƒá from Cibona. 1989‚Äì90 treble: Euroleague repeat, Yugoslav League three-peat, and Yugoslav Cup During the summer 1989 off-season, Maljkoviƒá and club general-manager Josip Biliƒá faced a crisis over Raƒëa's status after the young center got drafted by Boston Celtics in late June. Under contract with Jugoplastika until 1992, the 22-year-old expressed willingness to join Boston right away \\"if the financial offer is good\\", but the Split club was adamant they would not release him.Coach Denies Yugoslav Will Join Celtics : But Lakers' Pick Will Be Permitted to Play in NBA;Los Angeles Times, 29 June 1989 Maljkoviƒá even publicly called on Yugoslav Basketball Association (KSJ) to adopt safeguard policies, preventing players younger than 26 from transferring to NBA teams.Calling for safeguards against NBA raids on its players, a...;Los Angeles Times, 30 June 1989 After weeks of wrangling over his status, Raƒëa tried to force Jugoplastika's hand by acting unilaterally ‚Äî flying over to the U.S. and signing a one-year contract with the Celtics, reportedly in the neighbourhood of $500,000. However, seeing the situation as a clear case of contract poaching by Boston and its GM Jan Volk, the Split club wouldn't give up the legal fight. They took the case to US courts that ruled in their favour in late September, prohibiting Raƒëa from playing for the CelticsU.S. Court Bars Yugoslav Star From Joining Celtics;Los Angeles Times, 26 September 1989 thus forcing him to work out some kind of an agreement with Jugoplastika. In the middle of the Raƒëa saga, not knowing its outcome, Maljkoviƒá did some contingency planning by bringing in 22-year-old Zoran Saviƒá from ƒåelik Zenica who could play both the center and power forward positions. He also brought in point guard Petar Naumoski and power forward Aramis Nagliƒá. Starting the new season, as the reigning European champion, Maljkoviƒá's team got invited to participate at the McDonald's Open in Rome in late October 1989. Before the tournament, Maljkoviƒá got presented with the European Coach of the Year award. The friendly tournament was also Maljkoviƒá's first chance to coach against an NBA team as his Jugoplastika put in a great effort against Doug Moe's Denver Nuggets featuring small forward Alex English, guard Fat Lever, and veteran Walter Davis, losing 129‚Äì135 in a run-and-gun contest. =FC Barcelona= After four spectacular seasons at Split, Maljkoviƒá became one of the most sought-after coaches in Europe. He accepted FC Barcelona's offer, taking over in summer 1990. With four consecutive Spanish League titles behind them, Bar√ßa were looking for European success that continually eluded it. In fact, it was Maljkoviƒá's Jugoplastika that knocked Bar√ßa consecutively out of two previous Final Fours (1989 semifinal and 1990 final). With Maljkoviƒá's arrival, the previous head coach A√≠to Garc√≠a moved to an administrative role, becoming the club's new general manager. The relationship between new head coach Maljkoviƒá and new general manager A√≠to was fraught from the very beginning. Bar√ßa ended up with a fairly thin roster consisting of a few experienced players such as Audie Norris, Picul√≠n Ortiz, Steve Trumbo, Nacho Soloz√°bal, and Epi as well as a slew of youngsters like Jos√© Luis Galilea, Roger Esteller, √Ångel Almeida, and Lisard Gonz√°lez, most of them called up from the club's youth system. Maljkoviƒá also got a club- assigned assistant Manolo Flores. Maljkoviƒá's team did well to make the Euroleague final four, however they fell at the very last hurdle, losing to his former team Pop 84. Later that season they failed to win the domestic league as well while Spanish King's Cup came as bit of a consolation. In a 2015 interview, talking about his 1990‚Äì91 season at Bar√ßa, Maljkoviƒá discussed the tension within the club's front office: Maljkoviƒá started the 1991‚Äì92 season at Barcelona, but on 22 November 1991, fourteen games into the league season, he decided to resign. =Limoges CSP= Maljkoviƒá wouldn't be without a head coaching job for long as barely just over a month later in January 1992, he took over Limoges mid-season. Led on the court by 32-year-old veteran Richard Dacoury, the team made the league playoffs final versus Pau-Orthez, but lost the best-of-three series 0‚Äì2 despite having the home-court advantage. The summer 1992 arrival of thirty-one-year-old veteran Michael Young as well as established Slovenian point guard Jure Zdovc from Knorr Bologna and power forward Jim Bilba set the club on an improbable run. Playing suffocating defense with low-scoring games, Maljkoviƒá's Limoges ended up winning the French League and the EuroLeague title. Drawn in a tough EuroLeague round robin group with Du≈°an Ivkoviƒá-coached Greek champions PAOK featuring fresh NBA arrival Cliff Levingston as well as holdovers Panagiotis Fasoulas, Ken Barlow, and Bane Preleviƒá, Ettore Messina's eager-for-Euro-success Knorr Bologna led by freshly arrived rising star Sa≈°a Daniloviƒá, EuroLeague runners- up Joventut Marbella led by the Jofresa brothers (Rafa and Tom√°s) and Jordi Villacampa, Maccabi Electra with veterans Doron Jamchi and David Ancrum, Scavolini Pesaro featuring emerging star Carlton Myers and veteran Walter Magnifico, few gave modest-looking Limoges roster much of a chance. Throughout the season, they produced unbalanced scoring with Young usually getting more than 30 points per game along with a handful of others contributing with less than 5 points. Maljkoviƒá received some flak for this playing style; Petar Skansi, the head coach of Benetton Treviso called him out for \\"playing anti- basketball\\" after their EuroLeague final in April 1993. =Panathinaikos= In summer 1995, Maljkoviƒá took the offer from Greek giants Panathinaikos, a club bankrolled by the pharmaceutical riches of the Giannakopoulos brothers ‚Äî Pavlos and Thanasis ‚Äî who invested heavily in search of elusive EuroLeague and domestic league success. The club was coming off yet another season of disappointment as they finished second in the Greek League to bitter rivals Olympiacos, while the EuroLeague Final Four semifinal loss, again to Olympiacos, came as an even more bitter pill. Maljkoviƒá's work was thus very clearly cut out for him, nothing less than the EuroLeague or Greek League title, preferably both, would do. Taking over for head coach Efthimis Kioumourtzoglou, Maljkoviƒá found a squad led by holdovers Panagiotis Giannakis, Kostas Patavoukas, Nikos Oikonomou, Fragiskos Alvertis, Christos Myriounis, Miroslav Pecarski and Stojko Vrankoviƒá, while the squad leader ≈Ωarko Paspalj left along with coach Kioumourtzoglou, both victims of the trophy-less season. However, the roster was about to get a big boost as the Giannakopoulos brothers managed to bring in 35-year-old NBA legend Dominique Wilkins to Athens, signing him to a two-year contract worth US$7 million. The arrival of Wilkins created a lot of buzz around the club as 5,000 fans greeted him upon landing at the Athens airport in September 1995. The next day some 13,000 fans turned out for his first practice. In the coach's first season at the club, Maljkoviƒá's Panathinaikos won the EuroLeague title, the club's first in its history. Maljkoviƒá coached Panathinaikos in the 1996‚Äì97 season to an 18‚Äì8 regular season record, which was enough for the 3rd spot that qualified it for the playoffs. However, as the playoffs were about to start the coach was let go on 13 April 1997 and replaced with Michalis Kyritsis. = Paris and Spain = Maljkoviƒá then went to Paris SG, Unicaja, and Real Madrid. After leaving Real Madrid, a lot of speculation appeared about his next coaching job. In an interview with Sportski ≈æurnal, he said that he had been offered the role of head coach of the Lithuanian League club ≈Ωalgiris, but that he would only take the job in the summer, after the season had finished. He also said that he received several other offers, but refused to disclose which clubs they were from. Finally, on 9 March 2007, he was unveiled as the new head coach of TAU Cer√°mica, replacing Velimir Perasoviƒá, who abruptly stepped down in mid-season, due to health reasons. Coincidentally, Maljkoviƒá coached Perasoviƒá for four years at Jugoplastika.http://www.b92.net/sport/kosarka/kosarka.php?yyyy=2007&mm;=03‚ÖÜ=08&nav;_id=235634 However, after a heavy 14-point loss in the 2007 EuroLeague Final Four to Panathinakos, Maljkoviƒá was criticized in the Spanish press, and a lot of speculation appeared about his future. During the off season, he and the club parted ways. On 12 December 2010, he took over the senior Slovenian national basketball team. =Lokomotiv Kuban= In the summer of 2011, Maljkoviƒá also took over the Russian club Lokomotiv-Kuban. Although close to getting fired in November 2011, due to the club's position in the Russian League being way off expectations,Maljkoviƒá dobio otkaz;sportske,net, 11 November 2011Slovenci tvrde da je Maljkoviƒá otpu≈°ten, Rusi demantuju;Blic, 11 November 2011 he was allowed to stay, leading the team to the final four of the VTB United League. He left at the end of the season in May 2012. =Cedevita= On 1 July 2012, Maljkoviƒá was formally presented as new coach of Croatian vice-champions Cedevita from Zagreb. On 20 November 2012 he resigned as head coach, stating that he no longer had a will or desire to coach the team.http://www.krepsinis.net/eurolyga/b-maljkoviciaus-pasitraukimo- priezastimi-tapo-i-treniruote-neblaivus-atejes-m-tomasas/214711; krepsinis.net 22 November 2012 Individual awards * 2√ó Coach of the Year in Europe (1988‚Äì89, 1989‚Äì90) * 2√ó European Coach of the Year awarded by FIBA Basket Magazine (1993, 1996) * 3√ó Coach of the Year in Yugoslavia (1987‚Äì88, 1988‚Äì89, 1989‚Äì90) * 2√ó Coach of the Year in France (1992‚Äì93, 1993‚Äì94) Coaching style Maljkoviƒá is known as a disciplinarian coach, stressing work ethic, holding grueling and frequent practice sessions. His coaching philosophy is based on defense, declaring in 1996, the year he won his second FIBA European Coach of the Year award: \\"What I considered to be good basketball was rejected by many people as lacking in spectacle, but I'm much happier and more likely to win 51‚Äì50 than to lose 128‚Äì124\\".OD SVAKOG TRENINGA PRAVIM FINALE ;NIN, 31 December 1996 He also stresses repetition as the key ingredient during practices: Maljkoviƒá cites Aca Nikoliƒá as the biggest professional influence and considers him \\"the best coach of all time, the best craftsman in our business\\".Poslednji ƒças sa Profesorom; Glas javnosti, 15 February 2000 Out of respect for his mentor, Maljkoviƒá campaigned in 2007 for the Belgrade Arena to be renamed \\"Professor Aleksandar Nikoliƒá Arena\\".Profesor Aleksandar Nikoliƒá je zaslu≈æio da 'Arena' nosi ime po njemu;Blic, 9 February 2007 Although receiving public support from many influential individuals in Serbian basketball, the initiative was ultimately not implemented. Maljkoviƒá also holds Ranko ≈Ωeravica in high esteem, considering him to be \\"the Dositej Obradoviƒá of Serbian basketball, making us basketball-literate\\". On numerous occasions Maljkoviƒá has stated that Toni Kukoƒç is the best player he's ever had an opportunity to coach.Maljkovic@Nedjeljom u 2;HRT, 2009 He also frequently praised Michael Young, Louis Bullock, and Audie Norris. Upon taking over the young Jugoplastika team in 1986, Maljkoviƒá explicitly forbid his players from celebrating baskets during games. Maljkoviƒá said he didn't want his players \\"driving airplanes after three-pointers\\" citing reigning Euroleague champion and Yugoslav League rival KK Cibona's shooting guard Aco Petroviƒá as a negative example in this regard. Instead, Maljkoviƒá said he wanted his players to be \\"exemplary young men that no father in Yugoslavia would regret giving away his daughter to\\". During his time at Panathinaikos, Maljkoviƒá got a chance to coach former NBA star Dominique Wilkins as well as another prominent player from the NBA John Salley, brought in and given big contracts by the club's owner Pavlos Giannakopoulos. Maljkoviƒá refused to modify his disciplinarian coaching style when it came to big-name players, treating them in the same stern and strict manner he treated others on the roster, all of which led to numerous run-ins with both Wilkins and Salley. Reporting on this, The New York Times described Maljkoviƒá as \\"likely to act less like Phil Jackson and more like Bobby Knight\\"Retirement Follows Pay Disputes With His Greek Team: Ex-NBA Star Salley Calls It Quits;The New York Times, 26 October 1996 while Sports Illustrated referred to him as \\"an austere Serb who believes in my-way-or-Yugo discipline\\".No Longer La Dolce Vita;Sports Illustrated, 19 May 1997 His often stated distaste for the NBA is also well known. In 2009, Maljkoviƒá said:  Administrative career  In October 2009, Maljkoviƒá became a member of the KK Crvena zvezda managing board. = Olympic Committee of Serbia = On 9 May 2017, Maljkoviƒá was elected president of the Olympic Committee of Serbia (OKS). He thus succeeded Serbian former basketball player Vlade Divac who had been performing the role since 2009.Bo≈æidar Maljkoviƒá novi predsednik Olimpijskog komiteta Srbije! Being the sole candidate for the post since the only other candidate, Ivan Todorov, dropped out four months earlier, Maljkoviƒá was elected by acclamation. Earlier in March 2017, two months before the OKS presidential elections, Du≈°an Ivkoviƒá, famous Serbian basketball coach and longtime administrator in the Serbian Basketball Federation (KSS), publicly criticized the election process and further alleged that Maljkoviƒá is being installed to the post by the Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá: \\"No one [from Serbian basketball] seems to be brave enough to publicly talk about the OKS presidential election. The OKS statute has just been changed and nobody says a peep. Vuƒçiƒá is ramming down everything in his path in order to install Bo≈æa Maljkoviƒá as the head of the OKS and no one says anything. Everyone knows it, but they're keeping silent. I don't want to name names, but when I ask my basketball administrator friends from the KSS: 'Are you supportive of this thing with Bo≈æa', they answer 'No' privately. But no one wants to say a word publicly; that's the fear I've been talking about\\".  Personal life  Maljkoviƒá is the father of Marina Maljkoviƒá (born 1981), also a professional basketball coach. =Row with Vlade Divac= In August 2011, during the EuroBasket 2011 preparations, Maljkoviƒá opened a public row with the Serbian Olympic Committee (OKS) president Vlade Divac, calling the former player a \\"fraudster and a liar\\" in Croatian sports daily newspaper Sportske novosti as a response to Divac's remark in Slovenian media that Slovenia would've been better off keeping Jure Zdovc as head coach instead of hiring Maljkoviƒá. The coach expanded on his insults, adding: \\"Divac isn't even aware that I got the Slovenia job after Memi Beƒçiroviƒá, not after Zdovc. The journalist talking to Divac wasn't kind to him, ringing him up before noon. Considering Divac usually wakes up around 3pm, he was probably still delirious\\". When told of Maljkoviƒá's comments, Divac refused to be drawn into name calling through the media, refusing to say anything more on the subject. However, Maljkoviƒá wasn't done, reacting to Divac's non-response with more insults and veiled accusations: \\"Divac crossed a line. Every so often he's got excesses like this one in the media. We're two different worlds. It's up to him now whether he wants to start in with me because I got an elaborate file showing what he's all about. I'd only like to add one more thing to my original statement. Divac is a huge fraudster and a huge liar\\". The row even prompted 86-year-old Bora Stankoviƒá, the Serbian basketball's elder statesman, to register his displeasure publicly, scolding both sides. Six years later in August 2017, Maljkoviƒá returned to blasting Divac in the Serbian media. Now the Serbian Olympic Committee (OKS) president himself, a post in which he had just succeeded Divac a few months earlier, Maljkoviƒá accused his OKS predecessor of scuttling Sa≈°a ƒêorƒëeviƒá's previous OKS presidency bid in 2008 by organizing \\"illegal elections within the OKS with the help of Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Daƒçiƒá whom Divac advised at the time\\". =Political views= In a March 2016 interview for Veƒçernje novosti, Maljkoviƒá expressed public support for the Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá by announcing his intention to vote for him at the upcoming parliamentary election, adding: \\"I've met with Vuƒçiƒá three times in my life. First, when he was in opposition, we had lunch at Le Moli√®re in Zmaj Jovina. Then second time at the SNS convention to which he had invited me and where I told him: 'I'm here for you whenever you need me, the guys [in power in Serbia] before you never did'. And the third time was when I went to him to correct that historical injustice [about no venue in Serbia being named after Aca Nikoliƒá] where he reacted phenomenally to my suggestion of changing Pionir's name to the Aleksandar Nikoliƒá Hall. Just like he had a monument built in honour of Borislav Pekiƒá, yet another thing the guys [in power in Serbia] before him didn't do. We have a relationship based on mutual respect, I see a tremendous work ethic in him. I won't take part in his election campaign for now, but I'll vote for him\\".

It was first shown in the UK on 5 April 1999 in the 9:00 pm BBC2 time slot, and was written by Doug Naylor and directed by Ed Bye. The episode also marks the final regular appearance of Chlo√´ Annett as Kochanski and Norman Lovett as Holly. Both characters would reappear in a guest capacity in later episodes. Plot The episode begins with a few lines of text explaining that the starship Hermes has been destroyed by a synthetic, highly corrosive micro-organism. An escape pod from the ship carries a lone survivor, Talia Garrett. The pod and the woman are picked up by Red Dwarf, but it is revealed that the microbe has also been brought on board when part of the empty escape pod dissolves away. Now some time into their prison sentence, the Dwarfers have been put on probation for good behaviour. Arnold Rimmer is attending to Captain Hollister as he recovers from yellow fever. Hollister notices that Rimmer has tried to slip in a form pardoning him from all crimes. Rimmer explains his ambition to become an officer someday, perhaps even a Captain. Hollister tells him he is not officer material and dismisses him as Talia enters. It seems that the Captain and Talia know each other from the past. Rimmer, disgusted at the Captain's success with women and his own failure in that regard, leaves. In the corridor he attempts to steal some chocolate from the vending machine, only for the AI of the machine to promise revenge. Rimmer tells the machine that the day that happens he'll be captain of the ship. Meanwhile, back in The Tank, Kryten tells Lister that he is changing Miss Kochanski's calendar, as she had earlier complained to him that it was \\"The wrong time of the month\\". Lister realises what is going on and instructs Kryten secretly on how to behave. Kochanski returns to her cell and discovers Kryten has attempted to celebrate her period with a banner that reads 'Have A Fantastic Period' as well as giving her a gift-wrapped tampon and encouraging her to try it on and give it a twirl. Kochanski makes Kryten realise he's been tricked. Later, in Lister and Rimmer's cell, they discover that Kryten, in an act of revenge, has hidden Baxter's illegal moonshine in their cell, just after Holly informs them of a cell inspection. Knowing that being caught with it will cost them probation, and with the water tank full the two have no choice but to drink the hooch. As a result, both are drunk when Ackerman arrives for the inspection. When Baxter finds out, believing his hooch was stolen by Rimmer and Lister, he threatens to finish off the two, now in sickbay, sleeping off the stomach pump. The two decide they need to escape. Kryten and Kochanski pretend to be ill to land in sickbay, while the Cat is forced to disguise himself as a nurse after his attempts to get beaten up only result in the toughest prisoner in The Tank offering to be his bitch. As the Dwarfers escape they find that the microbe from the Hermes is now eating away at Red Dwarf. They decide to tell Hollister (against Rimmer's advice), who then announces that Red Dwarf will be abandoned‚Äîhowever, due to a shortage of escape craft, the prisoners will be left behind to die. Now that the Dwarfers have the run of the ship, Kryten and Kochanski devise a plan which involves entering a mirror universe where everything is opposite; negative becomes positive and a virus becomes an antidote. Kryten builds a prism laser and directs it at a mirror to create a dimensional gateway. Rimmer crosses over with a sample of the virus, only for the device to break and trap him in the mirror universe. He realises he is not a failure in this universe but is instead Captain, and berates the alternative Hollister, now a 2nd Technician, for being useless. When Talia comes in, Rimmer, thinking she is his lover, snogs her, only to be told she is his spiritual advisor. Rimmer quickly goes to the science lab to talk to the professor, the alternative Cat, who knows the formula for the antidote (Cesiumfrancolithicmyxialobidiumrixydixydoxidexidroxhide). Given the complicated name, Rimmer asks for it to be written down. Rimmer triumphantly returns to his universe with the formula written down only to find Red Dwarf a flaming inferno falling apart with the others gone. The dispensing machine tells him that the other Dwarfers had repaired the prism and followed him into the mirror universe and Rimmer is now the ship's Captain since he's now the only crew member remaining. Rimmer tries to return to the mirror universe, but the microbe has destroyed the laser. Believing it to be his only hope, he prepares to create the antidote but the dispensing machine points out that the formula he has written down is now the formula for the virus, having reverted into its mirror opposite. After exchanging insults, the machine finally gets its own back on Rimmer by launching a can at his head and hitting him, knocking him to the ground and causing the now useless slip of paper containing the formula to burn up from the surrounding flames. The episode ends with the Grim Reaper, played by series director Ed Bye, coming to claim Rimmer as Adagio for Strings plays in the background. Rimmer kicks Death in the crotch and runs off down the flaming corridor, claiming that \\"only the good die young\\" as Death winces \\"That's never happened before ...\\" The episode ends with an ominous \\"The End\\" caption, but is soon refuted with its sudden erasure and replacement with a defiant \\"THE SMEG IT IS\\". Production This episode had a notorious production, having gone through numerous re-writes and re-shoots. The original climax, titled \\"Earth\\", was to have the Red Dwarf crew arrive back at Earth only for the ship to accidentally crash through the world's major landmarks. This was deemed too expensive to film, so an altogether different finale was written. Naylor would blame the expensive CGI dinosaur from \\"Pete\\" as the cause of the lack-of-budget for \\"Earth\\". One proposed ending was to feature Arnold Rimmer's dashing and heroic alter-ego Ace Rimmer returning to save the day (in reality, the ‚Äòoriginal‚Äô Arnold Rimmer). However this ending was not filmed. This, too, was changed at the last moment and the character of Death itself was introduced. The conclusion of this episode was a cliffhanger, although the ending of this last episode is open to interpretation. In 2009, ten years after the original broadcast of \\"Only the Good...\\"', a new special, Back to Earth, was broadcast by channel Dave. The events of \\"Only the Good...\\" are never referred to throughout the episode. It is not revealed what happened to Lister, Cat, Kryten and Kochanski once they crossed over into the mirror universe, or how or indeed if Rimmer escaped the decaying Red Dwarf - however, Rimmer is once again a hologram. The events are referred to at the end of the last episode of Series X, \\"The Beginning\\"; however, Rimmer is interrupted before exact details are given. Tony Slattery ‚Äì who had played an android in the soap Androids featured ten years previously in \\"Kryten\\" ‚Äì took on Rimmer as the voice of the vending machine, sitting behind the unit and speaking his lines live on set. Other guest stars included Mac McDonald as Captain Hollister, Graham McTavish as Governor Ackerman, Heidi Monsen as Talia, Ricky Grover as Baxter and David Verrey as Big Meat. =Alternative filmed ending= Rimmer salutes from the porthole of the captain's former quarters, ordering Kryten to go \\"full ahead\\" An alternative ending where the Dwarfers clearly survive, and indeed even find themselves in a similar situation to the earlier series of ‚Äò‚ÄôRed Dwarf‚Äô‚Äô, was scripted and filmed but cut at the last minute. However, it is available for viewing on the series VIII DVD special features. In this version of the episode, Rimmer successfully remembers the antidote to the microbe that is eating the ship. It takes him over two hours to memorise the name of the antidote, as he has to alternate between the mirror universe and back to read the name of the antidote (which becomes the chemical name of the microbe in our universe as the opposite of the antidote). However, Rimmer memorises the antidote just in time for Kryten to make up some of the chemical antidote and use it to destroy the microbe, with irony included as everyone else already knew its name. Red Dwarf having been saved from destruction, Rimmer takes up residence in the captain's quarters. Lister, Cat, and Kochanski party and celebrate at having survived, being no longer imprisoned in The Tank and once again have free run of the vessel. Kryten resumes his ironing duties. Meanwhile, the rest of the Red Dwarf crew‚ÄîCaptain Frank Hollister and the rest of the flight officers‚Äîlook on Red Dwarf helplessly from their fleet of Starbugs and Blue Midgets with which they escaped the disintegrating mothership. Kryten peeks through a porthole at the fleet and asks Rimmer if they should perhaps slow down Red Dwarf so that the rest of the crew can dock in the hangar bay and come aboard. Rimmer, reminiscent of Horatio Nelson at the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801 (in accordance with his military fantasies), replies 'Full ahead, Mr. Kryten, I see no ships!' The alternative ending concludes with Rimmer paying the money he owes to the dispensing machine he stole from earlier. However, the machine still fires a can at Rimmer's head, knocking him unconscious.

The Rural Cemetery Act was a law passed by the New York Legislature on April 27, 1847, that authorized commercial burial grounds in rural New York state. The law led to burial of human remains becoming a commercial business for the first time, replacing the practice of burying the dead in churchyards and on private farmland. One effect of the law was the development of a large concentration of cemeteries along the border between the New York City boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn, often called the \\"Cemetery Belt\\". The law's enactment came during an era when a burgeoning urban population was crowding out Manhattan churchyards traditionally used for burialsRhona Amon, The Cemetery Belt, Newsday website, accessed February 16, 2009 and the concept of the rural cemetery on the outskirts of a city was becoming stylish. Provisions and effects of the law The law authorized nonprofit entities to establish cemeteries on rural land and sell burial plots, and it exempted from property taxation land that was so used.\\"To Tax Cemeteries; Resolution Calling for Appointment of Committee Introduced at Albany\\", The New York Times, February 18, 1917 A few rural cemeteries had been established in New York before the new law was passed (including Green-Wood Cemetery in 1838 and Albany Rural Cemetery in 1844), but the law's passage soon led to the establishment of more new cemeteries near Manhattan, particularly in western Queens. The Act was significant because it was made it easier to establish charitable corporations for rural cemeteries. This Act was part of the larger movement for general incorporation statutes, so that those wishing to form corporations no longer needed to get a special act passed by the state legislature. This facilitated the development of corporations, which were seen as assisting in the development of a cultivate, Christian republic. This was part of co-operation between the legislature and charitable corporations.Alfred L. Brophy, \\"These Great and Beautiful Republics of the Dead\\": Public Constitutionalism and the Antebellum Cemetery Both churches and land speculators responded to the new law by purchasing rural land for cemeteries. The move to rural burial grounds was accelerated by public suspicion that contamination from graveyards had been a cause of the epidemics of cholera that occurred in New York City in 1832 and 1849. In 1852 the Common Council of New York City passed a law prohibiting new burials in the city, which then consisted only of Manhattan Island. The City of Brooklyn (which comprised a small area of what is now Brooklyn) had passed a similar law in 1849.Phoebe Neidl, \\"Where Brooklyn Is Laid to Rest\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, January 12, 2009 Lutheran Cemetery Calvary Cemetery, in Queens, which recorded its first burial in 1848, was created on land that the trustees of St. Patrick's Cathedral had begun to buy up two years earlier. Cypress Hills Cemetery, on the Queens‚ÄìBrooklyn boundary line, was the first nonreligious cemetery to be formed in Queens under the new law. Its first burial also took place in 1848. Lutheran Cemetery traces its beginnings to 1852, when Frederick William Geissenhainer, pastor of St. Paul's German Lutheran Church in Manhattan, bought in Middle Village, Queens, for a non-sectarian cemetery that was known in its early years as Lutheran Cemetery and later became All Faiths Cemetery.\\"History of All Faiths Cemetery\\", All Faiths Cemetery website, accessed February 16, 2009 Other Queens and Brooklyn cemeteries established in the earliest years of the new law included Cemetery of the Evergreens on the Brooklyn‚ÄìQueens border (founded in 1849 as a nonsectarian cemetery),The Cemetery of the Evergreens website, accessed February 16, 2009 Mount Olivet Cemetery in Queens (founded in 1850),\\"History of Mount Olivet Cemetery\\", Mount Olivet Cemetery website, accessed February 19, 2009 and St. Michael's Cemetery in Queens (founded in 1852).\\"About St. Michael's\\", St. Michael's Cemetery website, accessed February 19, 2009 In other parts of the state, rural cemeteries established after the passage of the Act included Oakwood Cemetery in Troy, founded in 1848,\\"National Register of Historic Places nomination form for Oakwood Cemetery, Troy, New York\\" , 1984 and Oakwood Cemetery in Syracuse, dedicated in 1859.\\"History of Oakwood\\", Oakwood Cemetery (Syracuse) website, accessed July 20, 2009 With the availability of new cemetery land outside the city, existing graveyards in Manhattan were abolished to make way for new development, with their gravestones removed and the human remains disinterred and reburied outside the city.Marilyn Yalom (2008), The American Resting Place: Four Hundred Years of History Through Our Cemeteries and Burial Grounds, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, , , page 82 Between 1854 to 1856, more than 15,000 bodies were exhumed from churchyards in Manhattan and Williamsburg and moved to Cypress Hills Cemetery. Over the decades, Cypress Hills Cemetery alone is estimated to have reburied the remains of 35,000 people disinterred from their original burial sites in Manhattan. Other rural cemeteries that reinterred remains originally buried in Manhattan graveyards include Calvary and Evergreens Cemeteries in Queens, Green-Wood Cemetery in south Brooklyn, and Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx.Carolee Inskeep (1998), The Graveyard Shift: A Family Historian's Guide to New York City Cemeteries, Ancestry Publishing, , , page xii Often, unidentified bones were reburied in mass graves. During construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, which was started in 1870, bodies buried at Sands Street Methodist Church in Brooklyn were exhumed and moved to the Cemetery of the Evergreens. The New York City‚Äìarea cemeteries established under the Rural Cemetery Act grew very large. In 1880, All Faiths Cemetery had more burials than any other non-sectarian cemetery in the U.S., and in 1904 it was the burial site for all 1,021 people who died when the excursion boat SS General Slocum caught fire and sank during a Sunday School outing. As of the 1990s Calvary Cemetery held nearly three million graves. Long-term impacts The Rural Cemetery Act led to Queens being a borough of cemeteries. Queens is home to 29 cemeteries holding more than five million graves and entombments, so that the \\"dead population\\" of the borough is more than twice the size of its live population. The large concentration of cemeteries on the border of Brooklyn and Queens is another effect of the law. Under the Act, each individual cemetery organization was limited to no more than 250 acres (1 km¬≤) in one county, but some organizations circumvented that limit by purchasing larger parcels straddling the boundaries of two counties. As result, 17 cemeteries straddle the border between Queens and Brooklyn, many of which are located on the \\"Cemetery Belt\\". As with Queens, the \\"dead population\\" of Brooklyn is estimated to exceed its living population. In 1917 a state legislator from Queens complained that the law and the concentration of cemeteries that it had produced resulted in more than one-fifth of Queens' land being exempt from property tax. As of 1918 more than of land in Queens were owned by private tax-exempt cemeteries. Under current New York law, all cemetery property is exempt from property taxation,Mark S. Klein, 2008 Guidebook to New York Taxes, CCH but current law allows the governments of Brooklyn, Queens, and certain other New York counties to limit the establishment of new cemeteries within their boundaries.Section 1506, Laws, Rules and Regulations of the New York State Cemetery Board, accessed January 16, 2009 References 1847 in American law 1847 in New York (state) New York (state) statutes ","title":"Rural Cemetery Act"},{"id":"5759532","text":"The Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR) is a professional body in the United Kingdom for public relations practitioners. Founded as the Institute for Public Relations in 1948,Alison Theaker, The Public Relations Handbook Routledge 2004 p.15 CIPR was awarded Chartered status by the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 2005 and added \\"Chartered\\" to its name. As of late 2012, CIPR had 10,095 members. The association provides training and education, publishes a code of conduct and hosts awards and events. It is governed by a Board of Directors led by a President who is elected each year. History Discussions at the first Public Relations Officers conference in November 1946 led to the foundation of the Institute of Public Relations (IPR) in February 1948. It established a Professional Practices committee in 1956 and incorporated in 1962. The Institute of Public Relations first discussed attaining chartered status, a professional recognition in the United Kingdom, with the Privy Council in 1956. The Privy Council said that in order to be awarded chartered status, the organisation would have \\"adopt and publish professional ethical standards relevant to the practice of public relations and to maintain procedures for the regulation of members' professional conduct and discipline.\\" The institute's first code of conduct was published seven years later in 1963. As of 2003 few members have been expelled for breaches in the code.L‚ÄôEtang, J. (2003) 'The myth of the ‚Äò'ethical guardian'‚Äô. An examination of its origins, potency and illusions', Journal of Communication Management, Vol. 8, No. 1, pp. 53‚Äì67. To support its bid for chartered status, IPR created a joint report with the Department of Trade and Industry in 2003 based on a survey of 812 professionals. The following year the Privy Council told IPR it needed to do more for the public good and professional development to qualify. By 2005, the privy council decided that IPR and its members act in a way that contributes to the public good and granted it chartered status. IPR added \\"Chartered\\" to its name. An analysis in the Journal of Communication Management in 2005 said that chartered status was needed in a time where public trust in businesses, institutions and governments was decreasing, but noted CIPR's limited power to enforce ethics among its members. CIPR changed its membership structure in 2011. Affiliate-level memberships were removed and the requirement for six years of experience to attain full membership status was reduced to two. That same year, CIPR responded to a report by the UK's Intellectual Property Office. CIPR felt that copyright policy decisions were prioritizing commercial interests over the public good. They expressed concern that the Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA) was both the most popular provider of newspaper clippings to public relations professionals in the UK and the organization that enforces the intellectual property rights of newspapers. PR industry and English Wikipedia. In December 2011 the Bureau of Investigative Journalism shot a covert video interview with Bell Pottinger executives, in which the executives referred to their \\"dark arts\\" for manipulating English Wikipedia entries for their clients. The following month CIPR announced it would work with the Wikipedia community to create guidance for public relations professionals on how to participate ethically on English Wikipedia. CIPR's guidance was made available for editing by the English Wikipedia community and published in June 2012. According to PRWeek and CorpComms Magazine the most important aspect of CIPR's guidance is that PR professionals not directly edit English Wikipedia articles about their clients or employers. Instead, CIPR recommends they offer content and suggestions to the English Wikipedia community. Lobbying In 2009 CIPR provided an official response to a report by the Public Administration Select Committee's (PASC) that suggested the creation of a new government entity to oversee and regulate lobbyists. The report suggested the creation of a requirement for lobbyists to register themselves and record their activities. CIPR's position was that regulation would complement CIPR's code of ethics, but that it was more important to regulate members of the House of Lords that were being lobbied to. CIPR also said that lobbying regulation should focus on regulating individuals instead of companies. In July 2013, CIPR joined The Public Relations Consultants Association and the Association of Professional Political Consultants in criticizing the UK government's definition of a lobbyist. CIPR's Director of Policy said the definition of lobbying was so narrow it would be \\"self-defeating\\" because few lobbyists would be defined as one. CIPR and other public relations trade associations support a registrar for lobbyists, though UK government estimates the cost of a registrar to be 500,000 pounds its first year and 200,000 every year thereafter. In June 2015 the CIPR launched the UK Lobbying Register to replace the joint voluntary register previously run in conjunction with The Public Relations Consultants Association and the Association of Professional Political Consultants. Organisation The Chartered Institute of Public Relations is governed by a 50-member Council that meets four times a year and an Executive Board that meets every six weeks. A President is elected each year that is usually supported by their predecessor. CIPR has six membership grades and 15 regional groups. CIPR had approximately 3,900 members in 1999, 7,000 by 2002, and 7,800 by 2004. By the end of 2012, CIPR had 10,095 members. Prior to 1999, applications for membership were processed over six weeks, before being ratified to an immediate acceptance system. CIPR is a member of the European PR Federation and a founding member of the Global Alliance for Public Relations and Communications Management. CIPR membership is bestowed in two categories: Associate CIPR member for new entrants to the field and full membership for those with at least two years of experience. It also has a Government Affairs Group dedicated to lobbyists. Services CIPR started hosting training and certification programmes in 1980. By 1998 it awarded 5,000 certificates and 3,000 diplomas. CIPR publishes a code of conduct that encourages members to \\"deal honestly and fairly\\" with clients, employers, business partners and the public. The code sets standards in personal conduct, integrity and confidentiality. Violations in its code are reported to the Professional Practices Committee, which may pass cases on to the Disciplinary Committee for sanctions. The institute hosts the Excellence Awards and the PRide awards. The Excellence Awards are bestowed in 28 categories based on a scoring of a campaign in four categories: planning, creativity, measurement and evaluation. CIPR maintains a public database of members, information on legislation affecting public relations, case studies, and a career guide. The organization also hosts networking, award and educational events. PR professionals don't have to be a member to attend events or training. In 2003, 2,000 non-members attended the organization's training and 7,000 non-members attended events. CIPR has published Public Relations from 1952 to 1988 and IPR Newsletter intermittently from 1956 to 1983, as well as other publications. It also publishes a series of books with case studies and tips from CIPR award- winners called the \\"PR in practice series.\\" References External links * CIPR website * CIPR Wikipedia Best Practice Guidance for Public Relations Professionals * UK Lobbying Register website Public relations in the United Kingdom Trade associations based in the United Kingdom Public Relations 1948 establishments in the United Kingdom Organizations established in 1948 ","title":"Chartered Institute of Public Relations"},{"id":"5759536","title":"Solomonia Saburova"},{"id":"5759540","text":"Victoria Hospital is a government run hospital affiliated with Bangalore Medical College now renamed Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute.

Archive of American Television. is an American film producer, television producer, and executive producer who has worked on many TV series, made-for-TV movies, and theatrical films. The Cincinnati, Ohio-born Fries moved to Los Angeles in 1952 and began working for the production and syndication company Ziv Television Programs. He later worked at Screen Gems, Columbia Pictures, and Metromedia. In 1974, he formed Charles Fries Productions, which later became Fries Entertainment, where he produced and/or supervised more than 275 hours of television movies and mini-series. Among the projects he produced are The Amazing Spider-Man television series, which aired in the USA between 1977‚Äì79, the 1980 television miniseries The Martian Chronicles, based on the book by Ray Bradbury, the 1981 television docudrama Bitter Harvest, and the 1989 made- for-TV movies Small Sacrifices and The Neon Empire. For theatrical release, he produced or was involved in the productions of the 1982 film Cat People, the 1986 skateboarding film Thrashin', and the 1989 film Troop Beverly Hills, which is based on his wife's, Ava Ostern Fries' experiences with Beverly Hills Girl Scout troop, which film she also produced, and Fries executive produced. Fries has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame since 1978. In 1986 he moved the star from the north side of Hollywood Blvd to the sidewalk in front of the building he occupied at 8922 Hollywood Blvd. Early life Fries worked for his father's produce company, Charles Fries Produce, while attending Elder High School in Cincinnati. He graduated in 1946 and went on to attend Ohio State University, where he became a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. After graduating from Ohio State in 1950, Fries continued to work for his father's produce business until, in 1952, his uncle, Joe Moore, who worked at Ziv Television Programs offered Fries the opportunity to move to California and work for the company.Boylson,Monica, \\"West Sider's move is made for TV,\\" Delhi-Price Hill Press, Cincinnati, OH, May 11, 2011, page B8  Education  He graduated from Ohio State University, where he also achieve an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree. He became vice-president in charge of production for Screen Gems, the Columbia Pictures Television arm and subsequently became Vice President in charge of feature film production/administration for the parent company where he worked with the top producers and directors in the industry when he after serving in various production and administrative capacities in the entertainment industry. Ziv Television Programs, Inc. Fries began to work for Ziv Television in 1952 at California Studios, which is now known as Raleigh Studios, in Hollywood, California. During his eight years at Ziv, the company produced shows such as The Cisco Kid, Highway Patrol, and Sea Hunt. \\"Television was a cottage industry in 1952, when I came on the scene. The Ziv office staff in Hollywood was very small, probably no more than fifteen people.\\" With Fries running the company's production and studio operations, Ziv became one of the more prominent independent TV syndication companies. Rather than only buying commercial air time on TV, advertisers during this period would typically buy entire programs, such as General Electric Theater hosted by Ronald Reagan and Texaco Star Theater hosted by Milton Berle. Ziv and other syndication companies would fashion a show for an advertiser by tailoring main titles and commercials to air in the number of cities that the advertiser would \\"buy.\\" These specially fashioned titles and commercials made it look like the advertiser owned and produced the entire series. The rise of network television ultimately prompted company founder Frederick Ziv to sell the company to United Artists in 1960. Screen Gems Fries parted ways with Ziv and was appointed Vice President In Charge of Production for Screen Gems, the Columbia Pictures television arm, in 1960. He was involved in the production of such series as Naked City, Route 66, Bewitched, Father Knows Best, and I Dream of Jeannie, during which he became lifelong friends with that sitcom's lead actress Barbara Eden. Years later, I Dream of Jeannie actor Larry Hagman confided to Fries that during production of the series, Hagman despised the bosses at Columbia and Screen Gems with such fervor that he once hired an airplane to fly over the studio so he could urinate out the window onto the buildings.Fries,Chuck, Godfather of the Television Movie - A History of Television, October 2010, Monte Cristo Publications, page 117 While working at Screen Gems, Fries took a meeting at the famed Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel with Harold Cohen, a former lawyer at several Hollywood talent agencies who was currently between jobs and looking to begin a new career as a producer. Fries arrived for an 8:00 a.m. breakfast meeting to find that Cohen's tablecloth was already soiled. When Fries asked what had happened, Cohen admitted that he'd already had a meeting with someone at 7:30. \\"I had some coffee with him and I'm gonna have my grapefruit now\\", Cohen said. After the meeting, Fries was getting up to leave when somebody else showed up at Cohen's table for an 8:45 meeting. This particular meeting between Fries and Cohen would ultimately result in Screen Gems' placing the variety show The Johnny Cash Show on the air. It ran for two seasons.Fries,Chuck, Godfather of the Television Movie - A History of Television, October 2010, Monte Cristo Publications, p. 119 Columbia and Metromedia In 1968, Fries became Vice President In Charge of Feature Film Production for Columbia Pictures, where he worked on theatrical films such as Castle Keep (with Burt Lancaster), The Horsemen (with Jack Palance), Five Easy Pieces (with Jack Nicholson and Karen Black), and Getting Straight (with Elliott Gould and Candice Bergen). After two years at Columbia, Fries became Executive Vice President In Charge of Production for Metromedia, where he produced and supervised 26 movies for television and 13 television series, including The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau. Chuck Fries Productions In 1974, Fries established Chuck Fries Productions, later known as Fries Entertainment, where he produced and/or supervised more than 275 hours of television movies and mini-series.

He has been awarded a special honor by ICAN: The Interagency for Child Abuse and Neglect. With his wife, Ava, he received honors from PATH: People Assisting The Homeless; The Maple Center, a Beverly Hills family counseling service; and Cedars Sinai Medical Center, among others. The couple has raised millions for worthy causes in the Los Angeles area with a particular emphasis on the arts and children. Fries served on the board of the American Film Institute and as part of the executive committee for 23 years. AFI honored him with an honorary doctorate in communication arts. While there he chaired an event known as Producer of the Year Award, offering the award to outstanding producers in the television industry, including such producers as Edgar Scherick, Dorothea Petrie, Richard Berg, among others. He has been a member of the Caucus for Producers, Writers, & Directors since 1974, where he served four terms as chair and received their most coveted awards. From Ohio State University he received an honorary degree, Doctor of the Arts, presented by the president of the university. He also received the Frederick W. Ziv Award from the University of Cincinnati at a formal presentation. Books Fries co-authored We'll Never Be Young Again: Remembering the Last Days of John F. Kennedy, a book incorporating over 100 letters from prominent individuals relating the impact Kennedy's death had had on them. The book was then developed as a staged reading for the Kirk Douglas Theatre. Fries wrote his autobiography, Chuck Fries Godfather of the Television Movie: A History of Television about the early years of television, the day-to-day workings of the entertainment business, the origins of television movies and what it takes to get them produced and distributed. Stage Plays His concept for the play, The Color of Rose, a three-woman show about the life of Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, was also presented at the Douglas Theatre and opened at the Emerson College Theatre in Boston in January 2011.

Marins is also known for creating and playing the character Coffin Joe (loosely translated from Z√© do Caix√£o) in a series of horror films; the character has since gone on to become his alter ego as well as a pop culture icon, a horror icon, and a cult figure. The popularity of Coffin Joe in Brazil has led to the character being referred to as \\"Brazil's National Boogeyman\\" and \\"Brazil's Freddy Krueger\\". Born in S√£o Paulo, Marins made his feature film directorial debut the 1950s with the film Adventurer's Fate. He went on to direct the 1964 film At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul, which is considered Brazil's first horror film. At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul marks the first appearance of the Coffin Joe character, a role that Marins would reprise in This Night I'll Possess Your Corpse (1967) and Embodiment of Evil (2008), along with a number of other films and television series. He is considered to have been a pioneer of Brazilian horror cinema and of graphically violent horror films in general. Early life Marins was born on Friday, 13 March 1936 in S√£o Paulo, Brazil at a farm in the Vila Mariana, to Antonio Andr√© Marins and Carmen Mogica Imperial, both descended from Spanish immigrants. His interest in filmmaking began at an early age. When Marins was three, his father ran a local cinema, and the family lived in a flat above it. During his childhood, Marins made short films with a camera that his parents had given to him as a present. These shorts starred himself and his neighbours, and were exhibited at churches and amusement parks. In 1953, at the age of 18, Marins founded Cia. Cinematogr√°fica Atlas (the Atlas Film Company). He acquired an abandoned synagogue which he transformed into a film studio and academy, where he gave acting lessons and trained technicians in order to finance his films. Career =Coffin Joe= Marins is best known for creating and portraying Coffin Joe, a character who is considered a horror icon, a Brazilian cultural icon, and a cult figure. An amoral undertaker with Nietzschian philosophies and a hatred for organized religion, the character appeared as the primary character in a trilogy (known as the \\"Coffin Joe Trilogy\\") revolving around his homicidal quest to find \\"the perfect woman\\" so he can achieve metaphorical immortality by having a son. Following the success of the first film in the series, Marins reprised his role as the character in This Night I'll Possess Your Corpse (1967) and Embodiment of Evil (2008), along with a number of other films and television series. The character has also appeared in comic books and music videos. The popularity of Coffin Joe has resulted in the character being referred to as the Brazilian equivalent of Freddy Krueger. =Other film work= Jos√© Mojica Marins in O Profeta da Fome (1971). Although most known for films in the horror genre, Marins also created exploitation, drugsploitation, sexploitation (often in the form of pseudo-documentaries), and Westerns. Marins is noted for his low-budget film style, often using friends and amateur actors as cast and crew. His films are usually set in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Marins became interested in cinema at a young age. He recounted that he made his first film, O Ju√≠zo Final (Judgement Day), shot in 8 mm, in 1948 at the age of 12. He followed with Encruzilhada da Perdi√ß√£o (Crossroads to Perdition, 1952). Mojica was one of several directors of the 2013 anthology horror film The Profane Exhibit, directing the segment \\"Viral\\". In 2014 he again collaborated with other directors on the anthology film The Black Fables. =Television work= Marins hosted a monthly interview program The Strange World of Coffin Joe on the Brazilian television station Canal Brasil, in which he discussed Brazilian media and culture with other contemporary figures, such as actors and musicians. His guests included Z√© Ramalho, Rog√©rio Skylab, and Supla. From 1967 to 1988, Marins hosted the program Al√©m, Muito Al√©m do Al√©m (Beyond, Far Beyond the Beyond) on TV Bandeirantes, in character as Coffin Joe, presenting short horror tales written by author and screenwriter Rubens Luchetti. Some scripts were later adapted as Coffin Joe comic books. The show's tapes were reused and currently there are no known intact recordings of this program. Marins directed and hosted The Show from the Other World (Um Show do Outro Mundo) on Rede Record de Televis√£o, again appearing as Coffin Joe. The half-hour program featured short horror films, with many of the stories sent in by the viewers themselves and adapted by members of Marins' production team. As with his earlier show, the original tapes were reused and there is no known record of this material. In 1996 Marins hosted the daily television program Cine Trash on TV Bandeirantes, which featured full-length horror films. =Documentaries= Marins appears in The Universe of Mojica Marins (O Universo de Jose Mojica Marins, 1978), a 26-minute documentary film directed by Ivan Cardoso. Marins portrays himself in the film, which also features interviews with Marins' mother Carmem Marins, film editor Nilcemar Leyart, and Sat√£ (Marins' assistant and bodyguard). In 1987 Marins released the semi-autobiographical documentary film Demons and Wonders (Dem√¥nios e Maravilhas), in which he appears as himself re-enacting moments from his life, with his family and associates playing themselves as well. A 2001 documentary film, Damned ‚Äì The Strange World of Jos√© Mojica Marins (Maldito - O Estranho Mundo de Jos√© Mojica Marins), directed by biographers Andr√© Barcinski and Ivan Finotti, examines Marins's life and works. It won the Special Jury Prize at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. Death Marins died of complications caused by bronchopneumonia on 19 February 2020, aged 83, in S√£o Paulo. Prior to his death, Marins had been hospitalized for about 20 days.

The province served as a Sasanian outpost, and played an important role in the Sasanian efforts to gain control over the Indian Ocean trade, and to establish their dominance in the wealthy regions of Hadramaut and Yemen. In the 6th- century, the province was ruled by the clients and allies of the Sasanians, the Lakhmids.  History  Eastern Arabia was in c. 240 conquered by Ardashir I (), who made it into the province of Mazun. According to the 8th-century ≈†ahrestƒÅnƒ´hƒÅ ƒ´ ƒírƒÅn≈°ahr, Ardashir appointed a certain Oshag of Hagar as marzban (general of a frontier province, \\"margrave\\") over the \\"Do-sar and Borg-gil by the wall of the Arabs.\\" He also deported the prominent Azd tribe from Oman to Shihr on the Hadhramaut coast. During the childhood of shah Shapur II (), Arab nomads made several incursions into the Sasanian homeland of Pars, where they raided Gor and its surroundings. Furthermore, they also made incursions into Meshan and Mazun. At the age of 16, Shapur II led an expedition against the Arabs; primarily campaigning against the Iyad tribe in Asoristan and thereafter he crossed the Persian Gulf, reaching eastern Arabia. He proceeded to attack the Banu Tamim in the Al Hajar Mountains. Shapur II reportedly killed a large number of the Arab population and destroyed their water supplies by stopping their wells with sand. After having dealt with the Arabs of eastern Arabia, he continued his expedition into western Arabia and Syria, where he attacked several cities‚Äîhe even went as far as Medina. Because of his cruel way of dealing with the Arabs, he was called Dh≈´ l-AktƒÅf \\"he who pierces shoulders\\" by them. Not only did Shapur II pacify the Arabs of the Persian Gulf, but he also pushed many Arab tribes further deep into the Arabian Peninsula. Furthermore, he also deported some Arab tribes by force; the Taghlib to Bahrain and Hatta; the Banu Abdul Qays and Banu Tamim to Hagar; the Banu Bakr to Kirman, and the Banu Hanzalah to a place near Hormizd- Ardashir. Sasanian garrisons were established in Oman's strategic coast in Al Batinah Region, including the tip of the Musandam Peninsula, Sohar, and Rustaq. Shapur II, in order to prevent the Arabs from making more raids into his country, ordered the construction of a wall near al-Hirah, which became known as war-i tƒÅzigƒÅn (\\"wall of the Arabs\\"). With Eastern Arabia more firmly under Sasanian control, and with the establishment of Sasanian garrison troops, the way for Zoroastrianism was opened. Pre-Islamic Arabian poets often makes mention of Zoroastrianism practices, which they must have either made contact with in Asoristan or Eastern Arabia. In c. 531/2, shah Khosrow I () appointed the Lakhmid king al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu'man as the ruler of Mazun. A late Sasanian fort is recently excavated in Fulayj, Oman.

In this sense, it is a branch of musical aesthetics. With the concurrent expansion of interest in music and information media over the past century, the term has come to acquire the conventional meaning of journalistic reporting on musical performances. Nature of music criticism The musicologist Winton Dean has suggested that \\"music is probably the most difficult of the arts to criticise.\\" Unlike the plastic or literary arts, the 'language' of music does not specifically relate to human sensory experience ‚Äì Dean's words, \\"the word 'love' is common coin in life and literature: the note C has nothing to do with breakfast or railway journeys or marital harmony.\\" Like dramatic art, music is recreated at every performance, and criticism may, therefore, be directed both at the text (musical score) and the performance. More specifically, as music has a temporal dimension that requires repetition or development of its material \\"problems of balance, contrast, expectation and fulfilment... are more central to music than to other arts, supported as these are by verbal or representational content.\\" The absence of a systematic or consensus-based musical aesthetics has also tended to make music criticism a highly subjective issue. \\"There is no counter-check outside the critic's own personality.\\" History =To end of 18th century= Critical references to music (often deprecating performers or styles) can be found in early literature, including, for example, in Plato's Laws and in the writings of medieval music theorists. According to Richard Taruskin, the active concert life of late 18th-century London meant that \\"the role and the function of arts criticism as we know it today were the creations of the English public.\\" However, the first magazines specifically devoted to music criticism seem to have developed in Germany, for example, Georg Philipp Telemann's Der getreue Music-Meister (1728), which included publications of new compositions, and Der kritische Musikus which appeared in Hamburg between 1737 and 1740. In France in the 1750s, the Querelle des Bouffons (the dispute between supporters of French and Italian opera styles as represented by Jean-Philippe Rameau and Jean-Baptiste Lully respectively) generated essays from Jean-Jacques Rousseau and others, including Denis Diderot's Rameau's Nephew (1761). The English composer Charles Avison (1709‚Äì1770) published the first work on musical criticism in the English language ‚Äì an Essay on Musical Expression published in 1752. In it, Avison claims that since the time of Palestrina and Raphael, music had improved in status whilst pictorial art had declined. However, he believes that George Frideric Handel is too much concerned with naturalistic imitation than with expression, and criticises the habit, in Italian operas, of > that egregious absurdity of repeating, and finishing many songs with the > first part; when it often happens, after the passions of anger and revenge > have been sufficiently expressed, that reconcilement and love are the > subjects of the second, and, therefore, should conclude the performance. Typically, until the late eighteenth century, music criticism centred on vocal rather than instrumental music ‚Äì \\"vocal music ... was the apex of [the] aesthetic hierarchy. One knew what music was expressing.\\" =Age of Romanticism= The last years of the eighteenth century reflected both a change of patronage of music from the aristocracy to the rising middle- classes, and the rise of Romanticism in the arts. Both of these had consequences for the practice of music criticism; \\"the tone of the critic was lowered as his audience expanded: he began to approach the reader as a colleague rather than a pedagogue\\", and a new generation of critics began to widen their consideration to other aspects of music than its pure representative aspects, becoming increasingly interested in instrumental music. Prominent amongst these was E. T. A. Hoffmann, who wrote in 1809 > That instrumental music has now risen to a level of which one probably had > no inkling not long ago and that the symphony, especially following...Haydn > and Mozart, has become the ultimate form of instrumental music ‚Äì the opera > of instruments, as it were ‚Äì all this is well-known to every music-lover. A further impetus to the direction of music criticism was given by the changing nature of concert programming with the establishment of the European classical music canon; indeed it is at this period that the word 'classical' is first applied to a received musical tradition. At the same time, the proportion of new music to 'canonic' music in concert programming began to decline, meaning that living composers were increasingly in competition with their dead predecessors. This was particularly the case in respect of the rise of Beethoven's reputation in his last year and posthumously.; ; . This gave rise both to writings on the value of the 'canon' and also to writings by composers and their supporters defending newer music. In 1798 the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, edited by Friedrich Rochlitz (1769‚Äì1842), began publication in Leipzig, and this is often regarded as the precursor of a new genre of criticism aimed at a wider readership than qualified connoisseurs. In subsequent years several regular journals dedicated to music criticism and reviews began to appear in major European centres, including The Harmonicon (London 1823‚Äì33), The Musical Times (London, 1844-date), the Revue et gazette musicale de Paris (Paris 1827‚Äì1880, founded by Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis), the Berliner allgemeine musikalische Zeitung founded in 1825 by A.M. Schlesinger and edited by A. B. Marx, and the Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik founded in 1834 in Leipzig by Robert Schumann and Friedrich Wieck, and later edited by Franz Brendel. Other journals at this period also began to carry extensive writings on music: Hector Berlioz wrote for the Parisian Journal des d√©bats, Heinrich Heine reported on music and literature in Paris for the Stuttgart Allgemeine Zeitung, the young Richard Wagner wrote articles for Heinrich Laube's magazine Zeitung f√ºr die elegante Welt and during his 1839‚Äì42 stay in Paris for Schlesinger's publishing house and German newspapers. In 1835 James William Davison (1813‚Äì85) began his lifelong career as a music critic, writing 40 years for The Times.

Payar Island status as a marine park offers protection for its diverse marine life. Payar Island is also a snorkelling and diving site famous for its corals. The Payar Island Marine Park is situated in the northern part of the Straits of Melaka, south of Langkawi and encompasses the islands of Payar, Lembu, Segantang and Kaca which are surrounded by coral reefs. The marine park teems with a diversity of marine life and vegetation. Many endangered species of fishes and marine organisms live within the sanctuary. Measuring 2 km long and 1/4 km wide, Payar Island is the most popular of the islands as its sheltered waters are ideal are for snorkelling, diving and swimming. Among the dive spots is the \\"Coral Garden\\", an area covered with bright, multi-hued soft corals. There are several sandy beaches on Payar island for picnics as well as hiking trails for those who wish to explore the island. Just off the beach, one can indulge in the experience of feeding baby sharks.Baby Shark Feeding in Pulau Payar, 2011/11/18 Facilities include gazebos, picnic tables, barbecue pits and restrooms at selected areas. There is also a Visitors' Centre that provides information about the marine park. Pulau Payar Marine Park Scuba diving is popular, even with the recent coral bleaching, and still very good. There are plenty of coral dive sites and a wide variety of marine life. Visitors can get to Payar Island from the Kuah jetty point by catamaran or speed boat. The catamaran services operated by Langkawi Coral, takes about 45 minutes to get to Payar Island while the speed boat takes an hour. It is advisable to book the catamaran service a day before the trip. Enquiries can be made with any travel agent in Kuah or at the jetty point for those intending to travel by speed boat. Apart from the fare, a levy of RM5.00 for adults and RM2.50 for children is charged for entry to the marine park. Recent Bleaching As of 2 November 2010, Payar Island Marine Park is just a shadow of its former self. Due to excessive carrying capacity and persistently extreme sea water temperatures for the last six months, the Payar Island Marine Park suffered from widespread coral bleaching at a critical level. The corals there are now dull whitish-grey/black and not the bright rainbow of colours they once were. Even marine life density around the area has been recorded to be significantly lesser compared to previous years. The Department of Marine Park Kedah has taken drastic action by closing the affected areas in order to minimize human aggravated stress on the corals. The closed areas are the Payar Marine Park Center and the famous Coral Garden. No snorkeling and diving activities are allowed in these areas up till today. The mass bleaching became even more severe by 2016 due to the prolonged El Nino phenomenon which started in mid 2015 affecting more than half the reefs in Thailand and Peninsular Malaysian waters.

Playing career Womack began his professional football career in July 1908 when he joined Birmingham from Rawmarsh Albion, having previously played for Lapham Street. He made his league debut in September 1908, away to Gainsborough Trinity. He spent nearly his entire playing career at Birmingham, never signing a contract, and was club captain for 16 years from 1912 to 1928.Club Officials & Backroom Staff at The Birmingham City FC archive During his time at the club, they twice finished in 3rd place in the Second Division (1913, 1920) and won the Second Division in 1921 and were still in the First Division when Womack left in May 1928 to join Worcester City as player-manager.

Womack disputed this and referred all enquirers to his board of directors. As a direct result, he resigned and moved to Fleetwood, Lancashire, in April 1940. He returned to management in July 1942, taking over at Notts County, but left three years later. In February 1945 he took over at Oldham Athletic, but resigned in April 1947 after Oldham had struggled in the first post-war season. Womack went back to Grimsby for a stint as 'guest' manager January in 1951 for five months whilst manager Charlie Spencer was recovering from an illness. He left in May 1951, after Grimsby's relegation.

She was the first Police Ombudsman from 1999 to 2007. In July 2009, it was announced that she was to be appointed to the House of Lords. Consequently, she was elevated to the peerage in September 2009. In December 2010, National University of Ireland, Maynooth appointed her as Chairman of its Governing Authority. She is a columnist with The Irish Catholic. Background O'Loan was born and educated in Hertfordshire, England, one of eight siblings. She studied law at King's College London, graduating in 1973, and became a law lecturer in Northern Ireland. In 1977 she survived an IRA bombing at Ulster Polytechnic, Jordanstown, while pregnant; she lost the baby as a result.The Telegraph article on O'Loan, 23 January 2007. She is married to Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor and former North Antrim MLA, Declan O'Loan; they have five sons. One of her sons, Damian, was badly beaten up in the Oldpark section of North Belfast. The attack, in June 2006, required him to receive hospital treatment. The motive for the attack has not yet been established. She was a voluntary marriage counsellor, working particularly to prepare young people from different religions who are getting married. Baroness O'Loan was appointed as latest chair of the Daniel Morgan inquiry in July 2014. Following the long gap after Sir Stanley Burnton was forced to quit, Baroness O'Loan has been made the new head of a long-running series of inquiries into the murder and subsequent cover up of the ex-private investigator. Previous career O'Loan is a qualified solicitor and was a law lecturer at the Ulster Polytechnic and University of Ulster from 1974 to 1992. She was then a Senior Lecturer holding the Jean Monnet Chair in European Law at the University of Ulster from 1992 until her appointment as Ombudsman. She has also been: * Chairman of the Northern Ireland Consumer Committee for Electricity * Member of the Police Authority ** Vice-Chair of the Police Authority's Community Relation Committee; * Member of the Northern Health and Social Services Board ** Convenor for Complaints for the Northern Health and Social Services Board * Member of the General Consumer Council, and Convenor of the Transport and Energy Group of that Council * Legal expert member of the European Commission's Consumers Consultative Council * Member of the Green Economy Working Group * Chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission's Human Rights Enquiry Independent custody visitor (formerly known as \\"lay visitor\\") For seven years, she was an independent custody visitor (\\"lay visitor\\") to police stations, which meant she could speak to people being detained, at any time of the day or night.Independent Custody Visitors website; retrieved 10 January 2008; accessed 24 March 2014. Career as Ombudsman O'Loan was appointed by Her Majesty's Government to the post of Police Ombudsman designate in 1999. The Ombudsman's Office was created by the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998. This reform came into force some two weeks prior to the Belfast Agreement and the office's existence and practice has been the subject of continued controversy since. In August 2001, she was tasked with looking into police handling of the Omagh bombing in 1998. This attack killed 29 people (and 2 unborn children). Her report, published in December 2001, found that the Royal Ulster Constabulary had prior knowledge of some form of attack planned for that area and it questioned the leadership of Northern Ireland's then Chief Constable, Sir Ronnie Flanagan. Responding to the report, Flanagan said he considered the report to represent neither a \\"fair, thorough or rigorous investigation\\".\\"Omagh bomb report 'grossly unfair'\\" BBC News website, 12 December 2001 He said he was considering legal action on a \\"personal and organisational basis\\". An application for a High Court judicial review of the report was made by the Police Association trade union in 2002 and withdrawn in 2003. He further added: \\"I consider it to be a report of an erroneous conclusion reached in advance and then a desperate attempt to find anything that might happen to fit in with that, and a determination to exclude anything which does not fit that erroneous conclusion\\". Flanagan said that if he believed the allegations in the report had been true \\"I would not only resign, I would publicly commit suicide.\\" O'Loan attracted both praise and criticism for her robust activity in investigating alleged abuses by officers in the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). She has also served as a trusted intermediary in controversial cases involving alleged criminal activity by Irish Republicans. This role came about because many Republicans did not yet recognise the PSNI as a legitimate and unbiased police service, and so refused to co-operate in its investigations. This role has largely disappeared as Sinn F√©in have now called upon republicans to assist the PSNI.BBC report on Sinn F√©in/PSNI dynamic; accessed 24 March 2014. A UK House of Commons Committee reported on the Police Ombudsman in 2005 and praised O'Loan, recommending that she be given wider powers. The same committee acknowledged that the Office was not seen as impartial by the PSNI and its officers and urged that these concerns be addressed. In December 2006, an independent survey by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency found that Protestants and Catholics are equally supportive of the Police Ombudsman. More than four out of five people questioned from both communities also believed that police officers and complainants would be treated fairly. In addition, a survey of police officers investigated by the Police Ombudsman's Office, suggests 85% believe they have been treated fairly by the office.Equal support for PSNI Ombudsman BBC News website, 1 December 2006 On 26 June 2007 former RCMP Assistant Commissioner Al Hutchinson was announced as the successor to O'Loan as Police Ombudsman, and he took up the office on 5 November 2007. Controversy Former Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis said, in relation to her handling of the Omagh Bomb Inquiry, that it was as though she had walked through \\"police interests and community interests like a suicide bomber\\". Former Secretary of State Peter Mandelson said she has displayed a \\"certain lack of experience and possibly gullibility\\" in relation to the same affair. During the summer of 2006 her youngest son Ciar√°n, 18, was involved in an altercation with police in his home town. The PSNI announced their intention to caution him, but later reversed the decision without comment. In October 2006 she was involved in a public row with Ian Paisley Jr. The incident happened in a Belfast coffee shop when Paisley was approached by O'Loan. She voiced her concerns on alleged comments made by Paisley about her children. Her marriage to a nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor has, in the past, caused Paisley to question her ability to remain independent. Upon her retirement, a farewell party was organised, to which all political parties were invited. However, no representatives from the Ulster Unionist Party, Democratic Unionist Party or Sinn F√©in attended.Sunday Life, 4 November 2007 In August 2008 O'Loan while being interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour caused controversy by reportedly claiming that Protestants in Northern Ireland were brought up not to trust Catholics.Controversy over O'Loan comments on BBC Radio4, August 2008; accessed 24 March 2014. Awards In 2003, the Annual Conference of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement (a US organisation) presented O'Loan with an award for her contribution to police accountability. In 2008 Dame Nuala was made Person of the Year at Ireland's Annual People of the Year Awards. On 3 July 2008, Dame Nuala was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) by the University of Ulster in recognition of her work as Police Ombudsman and for her contribution to the social development of Northern Ireland.\\"Dame Nuala warns of fragile peace\\", University of Ulster News Release, 3 July 2008 In 2008 O'Loan was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Laws by the Higher Education and Technical Awards Council, Ireland. That same year, she was also awarded an honorary Doctorate of Laws by the National University of Ireland, Maynooth. In 2010, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Laws by Queen's University Belfast.

The series was created by Tatsuo Yoshida. The Phantom Agents were modern day ninja working for the Japanese government, mostly against the dastardly \\"Black Flag\\" organization. They wore \\"pudding basin\\" motorcycle helmets, and in the earlier episodes they ran everywhere in single file, but later graduated to a Toyota Crown Saloon. The Phantom Agents were armed with ninja weapons such as shuriken and used guns \\"only as a last resort,\\" as was patiently explained to the only female member in the title sequence of each episode. They had the ability to jump backwards up onto the limbs of trees and could hold a piece of cloth with a brick pattern on it in front of them and thus blend into the wall behind them, becoming invisible to their opponents. The series starred Joh Mizuki as Phantar, the leader of the Phantom Agents. Other agents included Tugor, Cordo, Zemo and a female agent, Margo (later replaced by Gina). There was also a small boy agent, Tomba. Other agents that joined later in the series were Andar (who seemed to replace Tugor) and Mundo, who could roll himself up into a bowling ball to knock over the villains. Tugor was killed by a bomb in one of the episodes, leaving behind only a boot that many fans remember as a sad moment in the series. Another agent, Gino, was killed in the first episode. The three main criminal organisations the Phantom Agents fought against each had a distinctive character: * The Black Flags of Smigzee included black-clad ninja and also uniformed guards at their island base. (Smigzee means Secret Military Intelligence Group Zee according to an explanation given in the Phantom Agents episode Operation Red Ghost.) * The Mocula looked much like Yakuza or Mafia hoods, but with added ninja abilities. * The Ghost Group, who were the main adversary in later episodes, had a mysterious magical aspect and included magicians with highly specialised skills.  Impact beyond Japan  Phantom Agents first screened in Australia on 31 January 1966. The series, shown mainly in Sydney, enjoyed considerable popularity among Australian children following on from the huge success of The Samurai, the first Japanese TV series ever shown in Australia, which became a major ratings success there during 1965. A teen rock band in Melbourne has named themselves The Phantom Agents. The show was aired in the US, but not to any regular schedule, mostly being relegated to \\"filler\\" status between sporting events. A \\"Captain Jack McCarthy\\" character was used to provide some sort of continuity between the erratic showings of episodes, although fans of the show have commented that they suspect that he never actually watched an episode. It was not a ratings success there, at least partly due to the sporadic programming schedule, and the fact that it was often broadcast at times inconvenient for schoolchildren to watch. A Spanish-dubbed version was also shown in some South American countries and Agentes Fantasmas was shown in Portuguese-speaking Brazil.

Hooke, 18th century. The achromatic telescope is a refracting telescope that uses an achromatic lens to correct for chromatic aberration. How it works When an image passes through a lens, the light is refracted at different angles for different wavelengths. This produces focal lengths that are dependent on the color of the light. So, for example, at the focal plane an image may be focused at the red end of the spectrum, but blurred at the blue end. This effect is particularly noticeable the further an object lies from the central axis of the telescope. The image of a star can appear blue on one side and orange on the other. Early refracting telescopes with non-achromatic objectives were constructed with very long focal lengths to mask the chromatic aberration. An Achromatic telescope uses an achromatic lens to correct for this. An achromatic lens is a compound lenses made with two types of glass with different dispersion. One element, a concave lens made out of Flint glass, has relatively high dispersion, while the other, a convex element made of Crown glass, has a lower dispersion. The crown lens is usually placed at the front due to the higher susceptibility of flint glass to atmospheric attack (exception: Steinheil doublet). The lens elements are mounted next to each other and shaped so that the chromatic aberration of one is counterbalanced by the chromatic aberration of the other, while the positive power of the crown lens element is not quite equaled by the negative power of the flint lens element. Together they form a weak positive lens that will bring two different wavelengths of light to a common focus. Achromatic telescope designs =Littrow doublet= Uses an equiconvex crown with R1=R2, and a flint with R3=-R2 and a flat back. Can produce a ghost image between R2 and R3 because they have the same radii. May also produce a ghost image between the flat R4 and rear of the telescope tube. =Fraunhofer= R1 is set greater than R2, and R2 is set close to, but not equal, R3. R4 is usually greater than R3. =Clark doublet= Uses an equiconvex crown with R1=R2, and a flint with R3~R2 and R4>>R3. R3 is set slightly shorter than R2 to create a focus mismatch between R2 and R3, thereby reducing ghosting between the crown and flint. =Oil spaced doublet= The use of oil between the crown and flint eliminates the effect of ghosting, particularly where R2=R3. It can also increase light transmission slightly and reduce the impact of errors in R2 and R3. =Steinheil doublet= Is a flint-first doublet in need of stronger curvature than, e.g., a Fraunhofer doubletKidger, M.J.

Fucosidosis is one of nine identified glycoprotein storage diseases. The gene encoding the alpha- fucosidase, FUCA 1, was found to be located to the short arm of chromosome 1p36 - p34,The Medical Biochemistry Page by Carrit and co-workers, in 1982.http://www.ismrd.org/glycoprotein_diseases/fucosidosis Cause Fucosidosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects many areas of the body. Mutations in the FUCA1 gene causes fucosidosis. The FUCA1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-L-fucosidase. The enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of complex sugars in the body. The disorder is characterized by lysosomal accumulation of a variety of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and oligosaccharides that contain fucose moieties. The deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-fucosidase, which is used to metabolize complex compounds in the body (fucose-containing glycolipids and fucose-containing glycoproteins). With the lack of this enzyme activity, the result is incomplete breakdown of glycolipids and glycoproteins. These partially broken down compounds accumulate in various parts of the body and begin to cause malfunction in cells, and can eventually cause cell death. Brain cells are especially sensitive to this buildup. Other results are progressive neurological deterioration, skin abnormalities, growth retardation, skeletal disease, and coarsening of facial features.Webmd Children's Health Fucosidosis is the consequence of faulty degradation of both sphingolipids and polysaccharides. Major accumulation of the H-antigen (a member of the ABO blood group antigens), a glycolipid, is seen primarily in the liver of fucosidosis patients. Diagnosis Diagnosis: A special urine test is available to check for any partially broken-down-sugars. If they are present, a skin or blood sample will be taken to test for below-normal amounts of alpha-fucosidase.  Fucosidosis is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that both parents have to have the mutation and pass it on to the child. When both parents have the mutation, there is a 25% chance of each child having fucosidosis. =Type 1= Type 1 usually begins somewhere in the first three to 18 months of age and in considered the most severe of the three types.about.com Symptoms include: * Coarse facial features * Enlarged liver, spleen, and/or heart * Intellectual disability * Seizures * Abnormal bone formation of many bones * Progressive deterioration of brain and spinal cord * Increased or decreased perspiration Patients have no vascular lesions, but have rapid psychomotor regression, severe and rapidly progressing neurologic signs, elevated sodium and chloride excretion in the sweat, and fatal outcome before the sixth year. =Type 2= Type 2 appears when a child is around 18 months of age and in considered milder than Type 1 but still severe. Symptoms include: * Symptoms similar to Type 1 but milder and progress more slowly. =Type 3= Type 3 appears around 1‚Äì2 years of age and is considered mild. Treatment Treatment: There is no treatment or way to reverse the disease. Treatment will focus on the symptoms an individual has, such as seizure medication. * It is possible that if an individual receives a bone marrow transplant, they could receive healthy bone marrow cells which would produce normal amounts of fucosidase. But there not is enough research to prove this is an effective treatment. History Fucosidosis is an extremely rare disorder first described in 1962 in two Italian siblings who showed progressive intellectual disability and neurological deterioration. The disease itself is extremely rare (less than 100 documented cases) only affecting 1:2,000,000, with most cases being occurring in Italy, Cuba, and the southwest U.S. The disease has three different types. Type 1 and 2 are considered severe, and Type 3 being a mild disease. Symptoms are highly variable with mild cases being able to live to within the third or fourth decade. Type 1 and 2 are both linked with mental retardation. Severe cases can develop life-threatening complications early in childhood. Because the major accumulating glycoconjugate in fucosidosis patients is the blood group H-antigen, it is intriguing to speculate, but the evidence is not clear at this time, that blood type may affect the course of the disease. Other forms Canine fucosidosis is found in the English Springer Spaniel. Typically affecting dogs between 18 months and four years, symptoms include: * Loss of learned behavior * Change in temperament * Blindness * Loss of balance * Deafness * Weight loss * From the onset, disease progress is quick and fatal. Just like the human version, canine fucosidosis is a recessive disorder and two copies of the gene must be present, one from each parent, in order to show symptoms of the disease.

The airport is currently the busiest in Haiti and is an operating hub for Salsa d'Haiti, Tortug' Air, Sunrise Airways, and Haiti Aviation. It is informally called \\"the Mais-G√¢t√© airport\\", named after the area in the Cul-de-Sac Plain where the airport was built.  History  During the 1940s, a military and civil airfield, Bowen Field, the smaller military airport in Chancerelles, not the international airport - was established near Baie de Port-au-Prince providing passenger air service by Compagnie ha√Øtienne de transports a√©riens. In the 1950s and the 1960s, it served as an airbase for the US military in Haiti. Developed with grant money from the US government and mostly money collected from Haitian people (taxes, lottery, etc.), the current airport opened as Fran√ßois Duvalier International Airport in 1965, after the Haitian president at the time, Fran√ßois \\"Papa Doc\\" Duvalier. Duvalier's son and successor, Jean-Claude Duvalier, resigned in 1986. The airport was renamed Port-au-Prince International Airport. Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide renamed the airport again as Toussaint Louverture International Airport in 2003 to honor Toussaint Louverture, the leader of the Haitian Revolution. The airport was badly damaged by the 2010 Haiti earthquake. On 25 November 2012, Haitian President Michel Joseph Martelly opened the newly-repaired arrivals terminal.  Facilities  Aerial view of Runway 10 The main building of the airport works as the International Terminal. It is a two-story concrete and glass structure. Lounges and a few retail stores are on the second floor of the main building. Check-in counters, gates and immigration facilities are on the lower floor. The Guy Malary Terminal (named after former Haitian Justice Minister Guy Malary) is used for domestic flights. There are further buildings used for general aviation and cargo flights. The airport has 3 jet bridges, but most passengers walk onto aircraft from mobile stairs. The ramp area can handle 12 planes.Globe and Mail, \\"A once sleepy airport is now Haiti's overstretched lifeline\\", Paul Koring, 19 January 2010 (accessed 20 January 2010) The airport is to be re-designed completely by the year 2015. The re-making of the airport is to add 14 gates to the terminal and also will make the main passenger terminal bigger. As of June 15, 2016, a taxiway is under construction to increase traffic capacity, as taxiing aircraft currently must use the active runway to taxi to their takeoff position. Work is being performed by China National Automation Control System Corporation which has multiple large construction contracts with the Haitian government.

Biography  Brian Elias was born in Bombay, India, and has lived in the U.K. since he was thirteen years old. After studying at the Royal College of Music he undertook private studies with Elisabeth Lutyens. His first major orchestral work L'Eylah was premiered at the BBC Proms in 1984. He has since had his works performed and recorded extensively by leading orchestras and soloists including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Britten Sinfonia, Jane Manning, Roderick Williams, Natalie Clein, and the Jerusalem Quartet. Elias collaborated with Kenneth MacMillan on his final ballet The Judas Tree, premiered in 1992 at the Royal Opera House. He has won two British Composer Awards - the first for his 2010 work Doubles, and the second for his 2013 work Electra Mourns. He has taught composition at the Royal Academy of Music and the Purcell School, and his students have included Joby Talbot and Darren Bloom. His works are published by Chester Music.

His latest work...takes just about every possible risk, facing technical hazards in setting Russian words and putting them into the most rarely successful of musical forms, the orchestral song cycle and also going for moral danger in taking its texts from Prison poetry....Elias handles her verse with tact and care..there is such abundant inventiveness in this half-hour score. Amply gifted as an orchestral composer....the music responds directly to the mood and image, but finds a great deal else to do as well.....purified intensity, immediacy and unrestrained lyricism\\".

Located to the north of Graham Street, between Evans Street and Station Street, the station has been demolished since 1987, and is now served by route 109 trams, stopping at a pair of low level platforms. History Graham station opened in 1888 as Graham Street, with the name simplified to Graham in 1909. The line through the station opened in 1854. The station was originally a pair of side platforms on a double track railway, and was set in the middle of a landscaped reserve 30.5 m (100 ft) wide, that ran between Boundary and Graham Streets, a remnant of a short lived Parliamentary provision that railway reservations be 100 yards in width. In 1914, with the opening of the New Pier (later Princes Pier), located to the north of the existing Station Pier (formerly named Railway Pier), Graham became a junction, with a new line diverging from the Up end of the station. The station had two sets of interlocked gates at the Graham Street level crossing, controlled by a signal box on the western side, as well as a number of goods sidings at the Up end. The Bridge Street level crossing also had its own signal box. By the 1960s, traffic to the port had dropped due to changes in cargo handling, and so in 1961, the branch to Princes Pier was reduced to a single track and worked as a siding, rather than a main line. Further rationalisations were made in December 1969, when the line from Graham to Port Melbourne was singled, with the Up track lifted, and the Up platform taken out of service. The signal box was also closed, replaced by a signal panel in a new station building, located on the Down platform. The Bridge Street level crossing and signal box had been replaced by boom barriers by 1964, and the Graham Street level crossing, at the Down end of the station, was abolished by October 1970, when grade separation was carried out. Only two lanes of the four lane road were completed, with the other two completed the next year. The last passenger train ran through the station on 10 October 1987, after it was announced that the line would be converted to light rail. Goods trains had continued to run through the station to Port Melbourne until at least September of that year. The replacement light rail line was officially opened on 18 December 1987.

The station was located to the south of Montague Street road underpass, between Woodgate Street and Gladstone Lane, with a large goods shed located on the Melbourne side of the station. The station has since been demolished and is now served by route 109 trams stopping at a pair of low level platforms. History Montague station opened in 1883, a number of years after the original opening of the line through it in 1854. The station mainly served workers at nearby factories, so under a new timetable in May 1967 the station was closed on Sundays due to a lack of passengers. This was altered in June 1969 so that two late night trains would stop there, to cater for shift workers. In 1908 plans were first made to relocate the functions of the 1870s Shipping Shed at Spencer Street station (roughly where platforms 9 and 10 are today) to a new location. A site to the north of the Port Melbourne line and on the Melbourne side of Montague station was selected, with work commencing in 1913. A southerly deviation of the Port Melbourne line was made between Clarendon and Inglis Streets to make way for two 5 ton travelling jib cranes, and Montague Street was extended northward under the tracks to compensate for the removal of the level crossing gates at Ferrars Street. Track work was underway in 1915 but was delayed by World War I, with the Shipping Shed not completed until late 1921. The Shipping Shed had a number of sidings inside, as well as more outside. Two goods lines ran to the north of the station, connecting the shipping shed yard with the main line near Inglis Street, where a signal box was located to control the points and signals. The signal box at Inglis Street was abolished in October 1971 and replaced by a signal panel at Graham station down the line. The shed operated in conjunction with the H.M. Customs Department for the handling of freight that arrived by sea at Port Melbourne's Princes Pier. This continued for five decades, until containerisation saw the end of conventional cargo handling at Port Melbourne. In later years the shed was used to store rolls of newsprint from Australian Paper Manufacturers Maryvale Mill until the closure of the line. The last passenger train ran to the station on 10 October 1987 after it was announced that the line would be converted to light rail. The last goods train to Montague Yard ran on 16 October 1987 with a single Y class diesel locomotive. The replacement light rail line was officially opened on 18 December 1987. In the early 1990s construction of the Melbourne Exhibition Centre (also known as Jeff's Shed) covered the area once occupied by the Shipping Shed, (see map 23) while the construction of Southbank tram depot and the diversion of Normanby Road towards Whiteman Street have obliterated all traces of the Shipping Shed yard.

There are more than 10,000 professional agrologists and agronomes in Canada , registered in ten (10) provincial institutes of agrologists. In the United States the professional designation is Certified Professional Agronomist (abbreviated C.PAg) . Role of the agrologist Agrologists are science based consultants, educated and specializing in areas such as animal science, food science, genetic engineering, soil science and environmental sciences. Professional agrologists may provide advice directly to farmers, vineyards, agricultural corporations., municipal and provincial governments, the fertilizer and seeds sector, consult on food processing, advise on range management, turf management and golf course operations, assess and provide remedial recommendations for brownlands (contaminated sites), watersheds, among many different areas of practice. Regulation and certification In Canada, professional agrologists are accredited through provincial regulatory bodies, e.g. Saskatchewan Institute of Agrology, Nova Scotia Institute of Agrologists. The requirements to attain professional designation (PAg) are similar in each province. A prospective agrologist is typically required to have a four year undergraduate science degree directly related to agrology. If accepted by their provincial institute, the applicant is known as an articling agrologist (AAg) or agrologist-in-training (AIT) and will complete a two year educational and mentorship program before being considered for a professional designation. Alternate certifications In Canada, a certification called Registered Technical Agrologist (RTag), or (PTag) is available, requiring a two-year college or university education in the agricultural sciences instead of a 4-year degree. These technologists designations require a two year mentorship and education program, and participate in same mentorship process as a professional agrologist. In the United States, the American Society of Agronomy is the regulatory organization responsible for certification. The American Society of Agronomy uses a sliding scale of education and experience to determine certification - it is required to have either a bachelor's degree in science and 5 years work experience, a master's degree related to agrology and 3 years work experience, or a Doctorate related to agrology and a single year of work experience. CPAgs are required to complete at least 50 hours of continuing education through the American Society of Agronomy every two years in order to retain their certification. The American Society of Agronomy also provides certifications for Certified Crop Advisors (CCA). To become a Certified Crop Adviser (CCA) an applicant must pass two exams that may both be written on the same day at the same location. The International exam is written by CCAs in North America. The Prairie region exam is written by individuals wishing to work as advisers in the three Prairie provinces of Canada or in the heartland states of the USA.

The novel grew out of Wouk's personal experiences aboard two destroyer- minesweepers in the Pacific Theater in World War II. Among its themes, it deals with the moral and ethical decisions made at sea by ship captains. The mutiny of the title is legalistic, not violent, and takes place during Typhoon Cobra, in December 1944. The court-martial that results provides the dramatic climax to the plot. Plot summary The story is told through the eyes of Willis Seward \\"Willie\\" Keith, an affluent but callow young graduate of Princeton University. Following a mediocre living as a nightclub piano player, he signs up for midshipman school at Columbia University with the United States Navy to avoid being drafted into the United States Army during World War II. He endures inner conflicts over his relationship with his domineering mother and with May Wynn, a beautiful red-haired nightclub singer, the daughter of Italian immigrants. After barely surviving a series of misadventures that earn him the highest number of demerits in his class, he is commissioned as an ensign in the Naval Reserve and assigned to the destroyer minesweeper U.S.S. Caine, an obsolete warship converted from a post-World War I-era destroyer. Willie, with a low opinion of the Navy, misses his ship when it leaves on a combat assignment. Rather than catch up with it, he plays piano for an admiral who has taken a shine to him. He has second thoughts after reading a last letter from his father, who has died of melanoma. But he soon forgets his guilt in the round of parties at the admiral's house. Eventually, he reports aboard the Caine. The ensign immediately disapproves of the ship's decaying condition and slovenly crew. He attributes these conditions to a slackness of discipline by the ship's longtime captain, Lieutenant Commander William De Vriess. Wouk's ship Destroyer/Minesweeper USS Zane after repair at Mare Island, San Francisco, September 1943, Note forward anti-aircraft gun, and three smokestacks Willie's lackadaisical attitude toward what he considers menial duties brings about a humiliating clash with De Vriess when Willie forgets to decode a communique announcing that De Vriess will soon be relieved. De Vriess is relieved by Lieutenant Commander Philip Francis Queeg, a strong, by-the-book figure, whom Willie at first believes to be just what the rusty Caine and its rough-necked crew needs. But Queeg has never handled a ship like this before, and he soon makes errors that he is unwilling to admit. Caine is sent to San Francisco for an overhaul, in an admiral's hope that the captain will make further mistakes someplace else. Before the ship departs, Queeg browbeats his officers into selling their liquor rations to him. In a breach of regulations, Queeg smuggles the liquor off the ship, and when it is lost, he blackmails Willie into paying for it. Willie sees May on leave, and after unsuccessfully attempting to seduce her, decides he has no future with a woman of a lower social class. He resolves to let the relationship die by not replying to her letters. As the Caine begins its missions under his command, Queeg loses the respect of the crew and loyalty of the wardroom through a series of incidents. Tensions aboard the ship cause Queeg to isolate himself from the other officers, who snub him as unworthy, believing him an oppressive coward. At one point, during the invasion of Kwajalein, Queeg is ordered to escort low-lying landing craft to their line of departure. But instead, Qeeg orders the Caine to throw over a yellow dye marker to mark the spot, and the Caine hastily leaves the battle area. The officers nickname Queeg \\"Old Yellowstain,\\" a nickname that implies cowardice. The dynamic, intellectual communications officer, Lieutenant Thomas Keefer, who had initially coined the nickname of \\"Old Yellowstain\\" for Queeg, suggests to the Caine's executive officer, the dutiful Lieutenant Stephen Maryk, that Queeg might be mentally ill. Keefer directs Maryk to \\"Section 184\\" of the Navy Regulations, under which a subordinate can relieve a commanding officer in extraordinary circumstances. Climax of the novel Maryk keeps a secret log of Queeg's eccentric behavior and decides to bring it to the attention of Admiral Halsey, commanding the Third Fleet. Keefer reluctantly supports Maryk, then gets cold feet and backs out, warning Maryk that his actions will be seen as mutiny. Soon afterward, the Caine is caught in a typhoon, an ordeal that sinks three destroyers. At the height of the storm, Queeg's paralysis of action convinces Maryk that he must relieve the captain of command to prevent the loss of the ship. Willie, as Officer of the Deck, supports the decision. Maryk turns Caine into the wind and rides out the storm. This sequence of events and its resolution marks the climax and most thrilling portion of the novel, and it parallels Wouk's experiences as Executive Officer aboard the destroyer minesweeper USS Southard in Okinawa during Typhoon Ida in September of 1945.Description of the ship in the typhoon in Wouk, Herman, The Caine Mutiny, (1953) Little, Brown and Company, Boston, New York, London, pgs. 344-57 The court martial Maryk is tried by court-martial for \\"conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline\\" instead of \\"making a mutiny.\\" Willie and John Stilwell, the enlisted helmsman (he is a gunner's mate second class) during the typhoon, are to be tried depending on the outcome of Maryk's trial. In the courtroom, Keefer distances himself from any responsibility for the relief. Lieutenant Barney Greenwald, a naval aviator who was an attorney in civilian life, represents Maryk. His opinion, after the captain was found sane by three Navy psychiatrists, is that Maryk was legally unjustified in relieving Queeg. Despite his own disgust with Maryk's and Willie's actions, Greenwald decides to take the case after deducing Keefer's role. During the trial, Greenwald unrelentingly cross-examines Queeg until he is overcome by stress. Greenwald's attacks on Queeg result in Maryk's acquittal and the dropping of charges against Willie. Maryk, who had aspired to a career in the regular Navy, is later sent to command a Landing Craft Infantry, a humiliation that ruins his Naval career ambitions. Queeg is transferred to a naval supply depot in Iowa. At a party celebrating both the acquittal and Keefer's success at selling his novel to a publisher, an intoxicated Greenwald calls Keefer a coward. He tells the gathering that he feels ashamed of having destroyed Queeg on the stand because Queeg and other regular armed-forces officers all did the necessary duty of guarding America in the peacetime Navy, which people like Keefer saw as beneath them. Greenwald asserts that men like Queeg kept Greenwald's Jewish mother from being \\"melted down into a bar of soap\\" by the Nazis. He calls Keefer, not Maryk, \\"the true author of 'The Caine Mutiny.'\\" Greenwald throws a glass of \\"the yellow wine\\" in Keefer's face, thereby bringing the term \\"Old Yellowstain\\" full circle back to the novelist. Willie returns to the Caine in the last days of the Okinawa campaign as its executive officer. Keefer is now the captain, and his behavior as captain is similar to Queeg's. The Caine is struck by a kamikaze, an event in which Willie discovers that he has matured into a naval officer. Keefer panics and orders the ship abandoned, but Willie remains aboard and rescues the situation by heroically dousing the fires. Keefer, discharged after the war ends, is ashamed of his cowardly behavior during the kamikaze attack, especially because his brother Roland had died saving his ship from kamikaze fire. Willie becomes the last captain of the Caine. He receives a Bronze Star Medal for his actions following the kamikaze --and a letter of reprimand for his part in unlawfully relieving Queeg. The findings of the court-martial have been overturned after a review by higher authority. Willie agrees in retrospect that the relief was unjustified and probably unnecessary. Willie keeps the Caine afloat during another typhoon and brings it back to Bayonne, New Jersey, for decommissioning after the end of the war. On reflection, he decides to ask May (now a blonde and using her real name of Marie Minotti) to marry him. However, this will not be as easy as he once thought, as she is now the girlfriend of a popular bandleader, for whom she is the vocalist. The book ends with Willie's and May's situation unresolved, but Willie determined to convince May to become his wife. Historical background Actual /Minesweeper with 3 stacks in 1945. Shown circled l to r, squared stern with cranes, guns aft, midship and forward. The fictional Caine had 2 stacks Wouk served during World War II aboard two destroyer-minesweepers converted from World War I-era s, being the first and being the second. (Wouk uses the latter name for one of his characters in the novel, Captain Randolph Patterson Southard. Also, in an allusion to history professor Jacques Barzun of his alma mater, Columbia University, Wouk also has Queeg refer to a previous assignment he had on a ship named Barzun.) USS Caine is a fictional depiction of a Clemson class DMS (destroyer-minesweeper) conversion. The Clemson class was named for Midshipman Henry A. Clemson, lost at sea on December 8, 1846, during the Mexican war, when the brig capsized off Vera Cruz in a sudden squall while chasing a blockade runner. In November 1842 Somers was the scene of the only recorded conspiracy to mutiny in U.S. Naval history when three members of the crew‚Äîa midshipman, a boatswain's mate, and a seaman‚Äîwere clapped in irons and subsequently hanged for planning a takeover of the vessel. Many of the incidents and plot details are autobiographical. Like both Keefer and Willie, Wouk rose through the ship's wardroom of Zane from assistant communications officer to first lieutenant. As executive officer of Southard, Wouk was recommended to captain the ship home to the United States at the end of the war before it was beached at Okinawa in September 1945 during Typhoon Louise. Wouk was serving aboard the USS Zane in December 1944, and though his ship did not experience much or any of the effects of Typhoon Cobra as did the fictional Caine during this time, the American Third Fleet had many ships lost or damaged in the Philippine Sea during the storm. The Zane, however, was grounded during a heavy rain squall while disembarking her troops in the Russell Islands around June of 1943, and as mentioned earlier, while serving as Executive Officer, Wouk offered to Captain the Clemson Class Destroyer/Minesweeper USS Southard home in September of 1945, before she was grounded off Okinawa by Typhoon Louise, a serious storm that damaged over 20 American ships. Wouk ran aground on the Southard in Okinawa in 1945 in Carpenter, Frederick I., \\"Herman Wouk\\", College English, January, 1956, vol. 17, no. 4, 1956, pp. 211‚Äì215. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/371577. Accessed 22 June 2020. The novel also describes the fictional Caine as having been struck by a kamikaze with Maryk in command during the Battle of Lingayen Gulf which caused relatively minor damage, and this did in fact happen to the Southard on January 6, 1945, although Wouk was not aboard at the time, as he was still serving on the Zane.The fictional Caine was struck by a kamikaze in Lingayen Gulf in Wouk, Herman, \\"Queeg vs. Greenwald\\", The Caine Mutiny, (1953) Little, Brown and Company, Boston, New York, London, pgs. 462-463 The name for the USS Caine came from the bible verse involving Caine killing his brother Abel, and is a reference to the banishment and resulting isolation felt by Caine as a result of his murdering his brother. The biblical Caine felt a similar sense of isolation and hopelessness that Willie Keith feels during his time aboard the Caine. Like Caine's exile, Willie Keith is nearly exiled from the Navy when he is given multiple demerits for infractions during his midshipman's training and is told another demerit of any kind will result in his expulsion. While supporting the efforts of the minesweepers and underwater demolition teams, another Clemson Class destroyer, the USS Kane served in the Marshall Islands and at Saipan in the Marianas at the same time as Wouk's ship the Zane. The Destroyer Kane may have prompted Wouk to think of the biblical Caine as a fitting name for his fictional ship. Reception The Caine Mutiny reached the top of the New York Times best seller list on August 12, 1951, after 17 weeks on the list, replacing From Here to Eternity.New York Times best seller list of August 12, 1951 It remained atop the list for 33 weeks until March 30, 1952, when it was replaced by My Cousin Rachel.New York Times best seller list of March 30, 1952 It moved back to first place on May 25, 1952, and remained another 15 weeks, before being supplanted by The Silver Chalice, and last appeared on August 23, 1953, after 122 weeks on the list.New York Times best seller list of August 23, 1953 Adaptations In 1954 Columbia Pictures released the film The Caine Mutiny starring Humphrey Bogart as Queeg in a widely acclaimed performance that earned him the third and final Academy Award nomination of his career. After the novel's success, Wouk adapted the court-martial sequence into a full-length, two-act Broadway play, The Caine Mutiny Court Martial. Directed by Charles Laughton, it was a success on the stage in 1954, opening five months before the release of the film and starring Lloyd Nolan as Queeg, John Hodiak as Maryk, and Henry Fonda as Greenwald. It has been revived twice on Broadway, and was presented on television live in 1955 under the direction of Franklyn J.

The story is set in Bolton and concerns the Crompton family, in particular the father, Rafe, and his attempts to assert his authority in the household as his children grow up. Productions It began life under the title My Flesh, My Blood as a BBC radio play, broadcast on 17 August 1957 in the Saturday Night Theatre strand. By April 1958 a BBC TV version had been broadcast and in October 1959 a stage adaptation was presented at the Bolton Hippodrome. Retitled Spring and Port Wine, the play was first produced in Birmingham prior to opening at London's Mermaid Theatre in November 1965, produced by Allan Davis and Michael Medwin in association with the Mermaid Theatre Trust; Davis was also the director. In January 1966 the production transferred to the Apollo Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue, with Alfred Marks, Ruth Dunning, John Alderton, Jennifer Wilson, Ray Mort, Gretchen Franklin and Melvyn Hayes in the cast. Subsequently moving to the New Theatre in July 1967 and the St Martin's in June 1968, it achieved a West End run of 1,236 performances. Alfred Marks, meanwhile, had left the cast and from 1967-8 played the lead role of Rafe Crompton in an Australian tour. The play was adapted (by N. Richard Nash, who was uncredited) to a setting in the United States under the title Keep It in the Family, which ran on Broadway at the Plymouth Theatre for five performances in September 1967. The play was profiled in the William Goldman book The Season: A Candid Look at Broadway. Film adaptation The play was filmed in 1969 - produced, once again, by Michael Medwin - and the result is a valuable time-capsule in that it depicts a Bolton of large, long-gone chimneys. Other parts of the film show street scenes and wide shots of the town as it was at the time of filming. It was filmed whilst many of the old industrial buildings remained and as St. Peters Way was being constructed, and the film includes panoramic shots of an early stage of work on that part of the new road adjacent to St Peter's Church, where it follows the former course of the River Croal and the Bolton arm of the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal. The lives depicted are very real for the period and this film captures an industrial town in transformation. In the film, Rafe was played by James Mason, and Diana Coupland played his wife Daisy. Susan George, Rodney Bewes, Hannah Gordon and Len Jones played the children, with Keith Buckley as Arthur and Frank Windsor, Avril Elgar and Adrienne Posta as their next-door neighbours, and Bernard Smidowicz as the Horsefall & Trott delivery driver. It was directed by Peter Hammond. Naughton himself provided the adaptation, and it was filmed on location in Bolton and at Lee International Studios in Wembley, Middlesex. =Cast= * James Mason as Rafe Crompton * Diana Coupland as Daisy Crompton * Susan George as Hilda Crompton * Rodney Bewes as Harold Crompton * Hannah Gordon as Florence Crompton * Len Jones as Wilfred Crompton * Adrienne Posta as Betty Duckworth * Keith Buckley as Arthur Gasket * Avril Elgar as Betsy-Jane Duckworth * Frank Windsor as Ned Duckworth * Bernard Smidowicz as Delivery Driver * Ken Parry as pawnbroker * Bernard Bresslaw as lorry driver * Arthur Lowe as Mr. Aspinall * Marjorie Rhodes as Mrs. Gasket * Joseph Greig as Allan (TV man) * Christopher Timothy as Joe (TV man) =Production= The movie was the first film shot at Elstree Studios after Bryan Forbes took over.Pearson, Kenneth. \\"The Great Film Gamble.\\" Sunday Times [London, England] 13 Apr. 1969: 53.

It is native to the desert and steppe regions of Asia, east from the Sinai Peninsula extending across Kazakhstan east to Mongolia. In the 19th century, vagrants were found as far west of their range as Great Britain. Populations have decreased by 20 to 50% between 1984 and 2004 mainly due to hunting and changes in land-use. MacQueen's bustard is a partial latitudinal migrant while the houbara bustard (C. undulata) is more sedentary. Both species are the only members of the genus Chlamydotis. MacQueen's bustard used to be regarded as a subspecies of the houbara bustard and known as the \\"Asian houbara\\". It is the unofficial provincial bird of Balochistan, Pakistan. Taxonomy Lithograph from Illustrations of Indian Zoology (1832) Otis macqueenii was proposed by John Edward Gray in 1834 for a bustard from India drawn by Thomas Hardwicke. It was long regarded a subspecies of the African houbara bustard Chlamydotis undulata. It was classified as a distinct species in 2003. The genus name Chlamydotis is from Ancient Greek khlamus, a horseman's cloak with weights sewn into the corners, and otis, bustard. MacQueen's bustard is larger than the houbara and much paler. The feathers on the top of the head include some long and curved feathers which are white or black with white bases. In the houbara, these crest feathers are all white and the difference is evident during the display of the male. The lack of intermediate forms in the region where the ranges of MacQueen's bustard and houbara bustard meet, presumed to be in the Nile valley, differences in morphology and display behaviour led to their being elevated to full species. The houbara bustard now refers only to the North African population, included as the nominate subspecies C. undulata undulata and a small population on the Canary Islands (C. u. fuertaventurae). Estimates based on the divergence of mitochondrial DNA sequence suggest that the species separated from the common ancestors of C. u. undulata and C. u. fuertaventurae nearly 430,000 years ago. This divergence may have begun 900,000 years ago, at a time of extreme aridity. The wide dispersal abilities of MacQueen's bustard ensure that their genes are more well mixed unlike the geographically structured genetic patterns shown by the African houbara. Description This medium-sized bustard is about long with a wingspan. It is brown above and white below, with black stripes down the sides of the neck. In flight, the long wings show large areas of black and brown on the flight feathers and a white patch at the base of the primaries. From below the wing is mostly white with a black trailing edge. Sexes are similar, but the female is smaller and paler above. Males and females are nearly identical in plumage but males are slightly larger than females. A study of the morphometrics of MacQueen's bustards from Pakistan based on about 79 individuals of known sex showed that the males were 9 to 15% larger than females on most measurements. The use of discriminant analysis allowed correct identification of the sexes based on morphometrics in about 99% of the cases. MacQueen's bustard is very silent except for the sounds that males make in their display. Like other bustards, they have a flamboyant display, raising the white feathers of the head and throat and withdrawing the head while walking around a chosen lek site. Distribution and habitat MacQueen's bustard occurs from the east of the Sinai Peninsula to the Caspian Sea and extending east to the Gobi Desert in Mongolia. Birds from the northern populations winter further south in Pakistan (mainly in western Balochistan) and in the dry arid zone of western India. Vagrants have historically been found as far west and north as Britain and as far south as northern Kerala (Kanhangad). A bird was shot in 1847 at Lincolnshire, Yorkshire in 1898, and another in Aberdeenshire in 1898 all in the month of October. Possibly the last of these vagrants visited Suffolk in November‚ÄìDecember 1962. This species breeds in deserts and other very arid sandy areas. A study of their habitat in Saudi Arabia found the species to be very dependent on good vegetation cover and tended to be found in areas with dense growth of scrub vegetation, particularly Capparis spinosa. A study in the steppes of Iran found that nest sites were chosen mainly in locations with high densities of insect prey which in turn were related to vegetation characteristics. Their migrations have been tracked using satellite transmitters. Mongolian birds leave the wintering areas in Afghanistan and Pakistan from mid to late March and arrive in their breeding grounds after about two months of flying, taking a path that avoids the high mountains of the Himalayas. They fly about a day and cover a total of with stopovers along the path. They spend about four months in their breeding territories before setting off again and reach their winter grounds from October to December. Behaviour and ecology  Illustration of a male in partial display with the ruff or collar erected The male houbara displays initially with the neck upright and the feathers on the base of the neck erected. A few feathers on the head are also erected while walking slowly, with one foot moved carefully and placed just ahead of the other. This is followed by a more vigorous phase of running either in a line or in a circle around a few bushes while the neck is tucked back into an \\"S\\". The neck feathers are erected and cover the head. The feet are raised in a measured gait and the neck is swayed from side to side. A low sound of breathing may be heard but only at very close. Males will call during display and if there are no potential mates, the display may be repeated. When a mate appears to be receptive, the male puffs up the black feathers on the sides of the neck so that it appears like a black collar or ruff and walks towards the female while twisting his body from side to side. The males mate with multiple females and after mating, the female alone builds the nest and incubates. The clutch consists of 2‚Äì4 eggs laid in a bare scrape on the ground. The eggs hatch after about 23 days and as in all bustards, the nidifugous chicks leave the nest immediately after hatching and follow the mother which picks insects and passes them to the chicks with her beak. The young fledge in about 30 days but remain close to their mother for several months. When pursued by falcons (such as the saker falcon or peregrine falcon) in falconry, the bustard rises into the air and spirals to avoid being struck. It has been claimed that it also defends itself by defecating on the falcon, the sticky green faeces causing the falcon to crash to the ground with wings stuck. This species is omnivorous taking seeds, berries, insects and other invertebrates. They do not drink water and obtain all the moisture they need from their diet. Tenebrionid beetles were found to be especially numerous in one study. Plant material makes up more of their diet during the non-breeding season. Threats The species was once nearly hunted to near-extinction in the Middle East by Arab falconers, hunters and poachers. It was considered great sport in colonial India, especially to hunt tiloor (the local name) from camel back. The bird would be approached in narrowing circles and on close approach the bustard would squat on the ground and conceal itself. The introduction of jeeps and guns however led to a drastic decline in the population of the species. Hunts in some parts of Pakistan have been organized for wealthy Arabs who purchase permits to hunt a limited number of birds but routinely exceed quotas. The meat of this bustard is considered in the Arab world to be an aphrodisiac and a diuretic according to another source. Rapid population declines of about 50% were seen in their breeding grounds in Kazakhstan between 1998 and 2002 and thought to be due to hunting, especially in their winter grounds. Annual declines over a ten-year period across Asia were estimated at around 27‚Äì30% in 2004. The main threat to the species is degradation of semi-desert habitat by the introduction of agriculture and by infrastructure development such as roads and electricity, which are responsible for increased mortality of birds. They also are at considerable risk during migration from heavy poaching as well as a lack of suitable habitats along their migration routes due to development. It is very sensitive to disturbance by humans and livestock when nesting. A study in Uzbekistan found that sheep grazing did not disturb the MacQueen's usage of non-breeding habitats.  Conservation  Conservation efforts were made across the region after the 1970s with international conservation organizations working along with local governments. Some captive breeding facilities were created including one in Saudi Arabia in 1986 and have been successful in captive breeding since the late 1990s, initially by incubating eggs collected from the wild and later entirely in captivity using artificial insemination. Captive-bred birds are considerably more inbred and may be susceptible to diseases. Being migratory species, it is important that captive-bred bustards undertake similar migrations as wild birds. Comparing the migrations of captive and wild birds using satellite telemetry, it was found that captive-bred individuals started autumn migration later and wintered closer to the breeding grounds than wild individuals. The surviving captive-bred bustards were also faithful in their wintering locations in subsequent years. As migration has a genetic component, it is important to consider migratory population structure, as well as natal and release-site fidelity, during captive breeding management of this species. The bird is protected in the United Arab Emirates. In February 2019, 50 birds were released into the desert in Al-Ain Region in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, to help conserve the birds and increase their number in the wild.

Childhood Birthplace of Mart Saar. Saar was born at the small borough of H√ºpassaare (now in Karjasoo, Suure-Jaani Parish), Viljandi County, Estonia, then part of the Livonian Governorate, Russian Empire, to Mihkel and Ann Saar (n√©e Kimmel). His father was employed in the forestry business. He was the eldest of fours siblings; Anna (1885-1968), Hans (1895-1979) and Jaan (1897-1898). He received his education in the village school at Kaansoo and the Suure-Jaani Parish school. His music teacher in the Suure-Jaani parish school was Joosep Kapp, the father of Artur Kapp, another famous Estonian composer. Additionally, Saar's father was a talented organist, who gave him lessons at home. Adult life In 1901, Saar left home to study music at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. He graduated in 1908 but chose to continue his studies. After graduation in 1911, he became a music teacher in Tartu. Ten years later, in 1921, he moved to Tallinn, Estonia as a freelance composer and organist. He spent his summers in his native borough H√ºpassaare. In August 1915, he married Elise Paalmann. The couple would have two children; a daughter Heli (1917-1975) and a son, √úlo (1927-1945). The marriage would end in divorce when Elise moved to the United States in 1937, initially expecting Saar to join her. However, Saar decided that he didn't wish to leave Estonia. Saar would later marry Magda Elisabeth Takk and have a daughter named Tuuli.Postimees.Helilooja t√ºtar kaalub H√ºpassaare maja riigilt tagasik√ºsimist. 7 August 2002. Retrieved 7 June 2016. Career Early in his career, Saar was influenced by the European music of the early 19th century. Later in his life, Saar combined Estonian folk music with more contemporary sounds. He mixed vocals into his symphonies. In addition to composing, Saar also wrote lyrics to some of his songs. Usually, these lyrics express a love for Estonia and nature. They also address the brevity of life. Saar's lyrics have been compared to the poetry of Anna Haava and Juhan Liiv.

A severe and chronic form is known as beriberi. There are two main types in adults: wet beriberi, and dry beriberi. Wet beriberi affects the cardiovascular system resulting in a fast heart rate, shortness of breath, and leg swelling. Dry beriberi affects the nervous system resulting in numbness of the hands and feet, confusion, trouble moving the legs, and pain. A form with loss of appetite and constipation may also occur. Another type, acute beriberi, is found mostly in babies and presents with loss of appetite, vomiting, lactic acidosis, changes in heart rate, and enlargement of the heart. Risk factors include a diet of mostly white rice, as well as alcoholism, dialysis, chronic diarrhea, and taking high doses of diuretics. Rarely it may be due to a genetic condition that results in difficulties absorbing thiamine found in food. Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome are forms of dry beriberi. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, low levels of thiamine in the urine, high blood lactate, and improvement with treatment. Treatment is by thiamine supplementation, either by mouth or by injection. With treatment, symptoms generally resolve in a couple of weeks. The disease may be prevented at the population level through the fortification of food. Thiamine deficiency is rare in the United States. It remains relatively common in sub-Saharan Africa. Outbreaks have been seen in refugee camps. Thiamine deficiency has been described for thousands of years in Asia and became more common in the late 1800s with the increased processing of rice. Signs and symptoms =Beriberi= Symptoms of beriberi include weight loss, emotional disturbances, impaired sensory perception, weakness and pain in the limbs, and periods of irregular heart rate. Edema (swelling of bodily tissues) is common. It may increase the amount of lactic acid and pyruvic acid within the blood. In advanced cases, the disease may cause high-output cardiac failure and death. Symptoms may occur concurrently with those of Wernicke's encephalopathy, a primarily neurological thiamine-deficiency related condition. Beriberi is divided into four categories as follows. The first three are historical and the fourth, gastrointestinal beriberi, was recognized in 2004: *Dry beriberi especially affects the peripheral nervous system. *Wet beriberi especially affects the cardiovascular system and other bodily systems. *Infantile beriberi affects the babies of malnourished mothers. *Gastrointestinal beriberi affects the digestive system and other bodily systems. Dry beriberi Dry beriberi causes wasting and partial paralysis resulting from damaged peripheral nerves. It is also referred to as endemic neuritis. It is characterized by: *Difficulty in walking *Tingling or loss of sensation (numbness) in hands and feet *Loss of tendon reflexes *Loss of muscle function or paralysis of the lower legs *Mental confusion/speech difficulties *Pain *Involuntary eye movements (nystagmus) *Vomiting A selective impairment of the large proprioceptive sensory fibers without motor impairment can occur and present as a prominent sensory ataxia, which is a loss of balance and coordination due to loss of the proprioceptive inputs from the periphery and loss of position sense. =Brain disease= Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE), Korsakoff syndrome (alcohol amnestic disorder), and Wernicke‚ÄìKorsakoff syndrome are forms of dry beriberi. Wernicke's encephalopathy is the most frequently encountered manifestation of thiamine deficiency in Western society,For an interesting discussion on thiamine fortification of foods, specifically targetting beer, see though it may also occur in patients with impaired nutrition from other causes, such as gastrointestinal disease, those with HIV/AIDS, and with the injudicious administration of parenteral glucose or hyperalimentation without adequate B-vitamin supplementation. This is a striking neuro-psychiatric disorder characterized by paralysis of eye movements, abnormal stance and gait, and markedly deranged mental function. Korsakoff syndrome is, in general, considered to occur with deterioration of brain function in patients initially diagnosed with WE.McCollum EV A History of Nutrition. Cambridge, MA: Riverside Press, Houghton Mifflin; 1957. This is an amnestic-confabulatory syndrome characterized by retrograde and anterograde amnesia, impairment of conceptual functions, and decreased spontaneity and initiative.Butterworth RF. Thiamin. In: Shils ME, Shike M, Ross AC, Caballero B, Cousins RJ, editors. Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease, 10th ed. Baltimore: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2006. Alcoholics may have thiamine deficiency because of the following: * Inadequate nutritional intake: Alcoholics tend to intake less than the recommended amount of thiamine. * Decreased uptake of thiamine from the GI tract: Active transport of thiamine into enterocytes is disturbed during acute alcohol exposure. * Liver thiamine stores are reduced due to hepatic steatosis or fibrosis. * Impaired thiamine utilization: Magnesium, which is required for the binding of thiamine to thiamine-using enzymes within the cell, is also deficient due to chronic alcohol consumption. The inefficient utilization of any thiamine that does reach the cells will further exacerbate the thiamine deficiency. * Ethanol per se inhibits thiamine transport in the gastrointestinal system and blocks phosphorylation of thiamine to its cofactor form (ThDP). Following improved nutrition and the removal of alcohol consumption, some impairments linked with thiamine deficiency are reversed, in particular poor brain functionality, although in more severe cases, Wernicke‚ÄìKorsakoff syndrome leaves permanent damage. (See delirium tremens.) =Wet beriberi= Wet beriberi affects the heart and circulatory system. It is sometimes fatal, as it causes a combination of heart failure and weakening of the capillary walls, which causes the peripheral tissues to become edematous. Wet beriberi is characterized by: *Increased heart rate *Vasodilation leading to decreased systemic vascular resistance, and high output heart failure *Elevated jugular venous pressure *Dyspnea (shortness of breath) on exertion *Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea *Peripheral edema (swelling of lower legs) *Dilated cardiomyopathy =Gastrointestinal beriberi= Gastrointestinal beriberi causes abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal beriberi is characterized by: *Abdominal pain *Nausea *Vomiting *Lactic acidosisDuca, J., Lum, C., & Lo, A. (2015). Elevated Lactate Secondary to Gastrointestinal Beriberi. J GEN INTERN MED Journal of General Internal Medicine =Infants= Infantile beriberi usually occurs between two and six months of age in children whose mothers have inadequate thiamine intake. It may present as either wet or dry beriberi. In the acute form, the baby develops dyspnea and cyanosis and soon dies of heart failure. These symptoms may be described in infantile beriberi: *Hoarseness, where the child makes moves to moan but emits no sound or just faint moans caused by nerve paralysis *Weight loss, becoming thinner and then marasmic as the disease progresses *Vomiting *Diarrhea *Pale skin *Edema *Ill temper *Alterations of the cardiovascular system, especially tachycardia (rapid heart rate) *Convulsions occasionally observed in the terminal stages Cause Beriberi may also be caused by shortcomings other than inadequate intake: diseases or operations on the digestive tract, alcoholism, dialysis, genetic deficiencies, etc. All these causes mainly affect the central nervous system, and provoke the development of what is known as Wernicke's disease or Wernicke's encephalopathy. Wernicke's disease is one of the most prevalent neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases. In autopsy series, features of Wernicke lesions are observed in approximately 2% of general cases. Medical record research shows that about 85% had not been diagnosed, although only 19% would be asymptomatic. In children, only 58% were diagnosed. In alcohol abusers, autopsy series showed neurological damages at rates of 12.5% or more. Mortality caused by Wernicke's disease reaches 17% of diseases, which means 3.4/1000 or about 25 million contemporaries. The number of people with Wernicke's disease may be even higher, considering that early stages may have dysfunctions prior to the production of observable lesions at necropsy. In addition, uncounted numbers of people can experience fetal damage and subsequent diseases. =Genetics= Genetic diseases of thiamine transport are rare but serious. Thiamine responsive megaloblastic anemia (TRMA) with diabetes mellitus and sensorineural deafness is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene SLC19A2, a high affinity thiamine transporter. TRMA patients do not show signs of systemic thiamine deficiency, suggesting redundancy in the thiamine transport system. This has led to the discovery of a second high-affinity thiamine transporter, SLC19A3. Leigh disease (subacute necrotising encephalomyelopathy) is an inherited disorder that affects mostly infants in the first years of life and is invariably fatal. Pathological similarities between Leigh disease and WE led to the hypothesis that the cause was a defect in thiamine metabolism. One of the most consistent findings has been an abnormality of the activation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.Butterworth RF. Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency disorders. In: McCandless DW, ed. Cerebral Energy Metabolism and Metabolic Encephalopathy. Plenum Publishing Corp.; 1985. Mutations in the SLC19A3 gene have been linked to biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease,Biotin- Thiamine-Responsive Basal Ganglia Disease - GeneReviews¬Æ - NCBI Bookshelf which is treated with pharmacological doses of thiamine and biotin, another B vitamin. Other disorders in which a putative role for thiamine has been implicated include subacute necrotising encephalomyelopathy, opsoclonic cerebellopathy (a paraneoplastic syndrome), and Nigerian seasonal ataxia. In addition, several inherited disorders of ThDP-dependent enzymes have been reported,Blass JP. Inborn errors of pyruvate metabolism. In: Stanbury JB, Wyngaarden JB, Frederckson DS et al., eds. Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 5th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1983. which may respond to thiamine treatment. Pathophysiology Thiamine in the human body has a half-life of 18 days and is quickly exhausted, particularly when metabolic demands exceed intake. A derivative of thiamine, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), is a cofactor involved in the citric acid cycle, as well as connecting the breakdown of sugars with the citric acid cycle. The citric acid cycle is a central metabolic pathway involved in the regulation of carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism, and its disruption due to thiamine deficiency inhibits the production of many molecules including the neurotransmitters glutamic acid and GABA. Additionally thiamine may also be directly involved in neuromodulation. Diagnosis Oxidation of thiamine derivatives to fluorescent thiochromes by potassium ferricyanide under alkaline conditions A positive diagnosis test for thiamine deficiency involves measuring the activity of the enzyme transketolase in erythrocytes (Erythrocyte transketolase activation assay). Alternatively, thiamine and its phosphphosphorylated derivatives, can directly be detected in whole blood, tissues, foods, animal feed, and pharmaceutical preparations following the conversion of thiamine to fluorescent thiochrome derivatives (Thiochrome assay) and separation by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Capillary electrophoresis (CE) techniques and in- capillary enzyme reaction methods have emerged as alternative techniques in quantifying and monitoring thiamine levels in samples. The normal thiamine concentration in EDTA-blood is about 20-100 ¬µg/l. Treatment Many people with beriberi can be treated with thiamine alone.Nguyen-Khoa, Dieu-Thu Beriberi (Thiamine Deficiency) Treatment & Management . Mescape Given thiamine intravenously (and later orally), rapid and dramatic recovery occurs, generally within 24 hours.Tanphaichitr V. Thiamin. In: Shils ME, Olsen JA, Shike M et al., editors. Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease. 9th ed. Baltimore: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 1999 Improvements of peripheral neuropathy may require several months of thiamine treatment.Maurice V, Adams RD, Collins GH. The Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome and Related Neurologic Disorders Due to Alcoholism and Malnutrition. 2nd ed. Philadelphia: FA Davis, 1989. Epidemiology Beriberi is a recurrent nutritional disease in detention houses, even in this century. In 1999, an outbreak of beriberi occurred in a detention center in Taiwan. High rates of illness and death in overcrowded Haitian jails in 2007 were traced to the traditional practice of washing rice before cooking. In the Ivory Coast, among a group of prisoners with heavy punishment, 64% were affected by beriberi. Before beginning treatment, prisoners exhibited symptoms of dry or wet beriberi with neurological signs (tingling: 41%), cardiovascular signs (dyspnoea: 42%, thoracic pain: 35%), and edemas of the lower limbs (51%). With treatment the rate of healing was about 97%. Populations under extreme stress may be at higher risk for beriberi. Displaced populations, such as refugees from war, are susceptible to micronutritional deficiency, including beriberi. The severe nutritional deprivation caused by famine also can cause beriberis, although symptoms may be overlooked in clinical assessment or masked by other famine- related problems. An extreme weight-loss diet can, rarely, induce a famine- like state and the accompanying beriberi. History Earliest written descriptions of thiamine deficiency are from Ancient China in the context of Chinese medicine. One of the earliest is by Ge Hong in his book Zhou hou bei ji fang (Emergency Formulas to Keep up Your Sleeve) written sometime during the 3rd century. Hong called the illness by the name jiao qi, which can be interpreted as \\"foot qi\\". He described the symptoms to include swelling, weakness and numbness of the feet. He also acknowledged that the illness could be deadly, and claimed that it could be cured by eating certain foods such as fermented soybeans in wine. Better known examples of early descriptions of \\"foot qi\\" are by Chao Yuanfang (who lived during 550‚Äì630) in his book Zhu bing yuan hou lun (Sources and Symptoms of All Diseases)HA Smith, p. 26-28 and by Sun Simiao (581‚Äì682) in his book Bei ji qian jin yao fang (Essential Emergency Formulas Worth a Thousand in Gold).HA Smith, p. 44 In the late 19th century, beriberi was studied by Takaki Kanehiro, a British-trained Japanese medical doctor of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Beriberi was a serious problem in the Japanese navy: Sailors fell ill an average of four times a year in the period 1878 to 1881, and 35% were cases of beriberi. In 1883, Takaki learned of a very high incidence of beriberi among cadets on a training mission from Japan to Hawaii, via New Zealand and South America. The voyage lasted more than nine months and resulted in 169 cases of sickness and 25 deaths on a ship of 376 men. With the support of the Japanese Navy, he conducted an experiment in which another ship was deployed on the same route, except that its crew was fed a diet of meat, fish, barley, rice, and beans. At the end of the voyage, this crew had only 14 cases of beriberi and no deaths. This convinced Takaki and the Japanese Navy that diet was the cause. In 1884, Takaki observed that beriberi was common among low-ranking crew who were often provided free rice and thus ate little else, but not among crews of Western navies, nor among Japanese officers who consumed a more varied diet. In 1897, Christiaan Eijkman, a Dutch physician and pathologist, demonstrated that beriberi is caused by poor diet, and discovered that feeding unpolished rice (instead of the polished variety) to chickens helped to prevent beriberi. The following year, Sir Frederick Hopkins postulated that some foods contained \\"accessory factors\\"‚Äîin addition to proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and salt‚Äîthat were necessary for the functions of the human body. In 1901, Gerrit Grijns, a Dutch physician and assistant to Christiaan Eijkman in the Netherlands, correctly interpreted beriberi as a deficiency syndrome, and between 1910 and 1913, Edward Bright Vedder established that an extract of rice bran is a treatment for beriberi. In 1929, Eijkman and Hopkins were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries. =Etymology= Although according to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term \\"beriberi\\" comes from a Sinhalese phrase meaning \\"weak, weak\\" or \\"I cannot, I cannot\\", the word being duplicated for emphasis,Oxford English Dictionary: \\"Beri-beri ... a Cingalese word, f. beri weakness, the reduplication being intensive ...\\", page 203, 1937 the origin of the phrase is questionable. It has also been suggested to come from Hindi, Arabic and a few other languages, with many meanings like \\"weakness\\", \\"sailor\\" and even \\"sheep\\". Such suggested origins were listed by Heinrich Botho Scheube among others. Edward Vedder wrote in his book Beriberi (1913) that \\"it is impossible to definitely trace the origin of the word beriberi\\". Word berbere was used in writing at least as early as 1568 by Diogo do Couto, when he described the deficiency in India.HA Smith, p. 118-119 \\"Kakke\\", which is a Japanese synonym for thiamine deficiency, comes from the way \\"jiao qi\\" is pronounced in Japanese.HA Smith, p. 149 \\"Jiao qi\\" is an old word used in Chinese medicine to describe beriberi. \\"Kakke\\" is supposed to have entered into the Japanese language sometime between the 6th and 8th centuries. Other animals =Poultry= As most feedstuffs used in poultry diets contain enough quantities of vitamins to meet the requirements in this species, deficiencies in this vitamin do not occur with commercial diets. This was, at least, the opinion in the 1960s.Merck Veterinary Manual, ed 1967, pp 1440-1441. Mature chickens show signs three weeks after being fed a deficient diet. In young chicks, it can appear before two weeks of age. Onset is sudden in young chicks. There is anorexia and an unsteady gait. Later on, there are locomotor signs, beginning with an apparent paralysis of the flexor of the toes. The characteristic position is called \\"stargazing\\", meaning a chick \\"sitting on its hocks and the head in opisthotonos\\". Response to administration of the vitamin is rather quick, occurring a few hours later.R.E. Austic and M.L. Scott, Nutritional deficiency diseases, in Diseases of poultry, ed. by M.S. Hofstad, Iowa State University Press, Ames, Iowa, USA , p. 50.The disease is described more carefully here: merckvetmanual.com =Ruminants= Polioencephalomalacia (PEM) is the most common thiamine deficiency disorder in young ruminant and nonruminant animals. Symptoms of PEM include a profuse, but transient, diarrhea, listlessness, circling movements, star gazing or opisthotonus (head drawn back over neck), and muscle tremors.National Research Council. 1996. Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle, Seventh Revised Ed. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press. The most common cause is high-carbohydrate feeds, leading to the overgrowth of thiaminase- producing bacteria, but dietary ingestion of thiaminase (e.g., in bracken fern), or inhibition of thiamine absorption by high sulfur intake are also possible.Polioencephalomalacia: Introduction , Merck Veterinary Manual Another cause of PEM is Clostridium sporogenes or Bacillus aneurinolyticus infection. These bacteria produce thiaminases that will cause an acute thiamine deficiency in the affected animal.Polioencephalomacia: Introduction , \\"ACES Publications\\" =Snakes= Snakes that consume a diet largely composed of goldfish and feeder minnows are susceptible to developing thiamine deficiency. This is often a problem observed in captivity when keeping garter and ribbon snakes that are fed a goldfish-exclusive diet, as these fish contain thiaminase, an enzyme that breaks down thiamine. =Wild birds and fish= Thiamine deficiency has been identified as the cause of a paralytic disease affecting wild birds in the Baltic Sea area dating back to 1982. In this condition, there is difficulty in keeping the wings folded along the side of the body when resting, loss of the ability to fly and voice, with eventual paralysis of the wings and legs and death. It affects primarily 0.5‚Äì1 kg sized birds such as the herring gull (Larus argentatus), common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) and common eider (Somateria mollissima). Researches noted, \\"Because the investigated species occupy a wide range of ecological niches and positions in the food web, we are open to the possibility that other animal classes may suffer from thiamine deficiency as well.\\"p. 12006 In the counties of Blekinge and Sk√•ne (southernmost Sweden), mass deaths of several bird species, especially the European herring gull, have been observed since the early 2000s. More recently, species of other classes seems to be affected. High mortality of salmon (Salmo salar) in the river M√∂rrums√•n is reported, and mammals such as the Eurasian Elk (Alces alces) have died in unusually high numbers. Lack of thiamine is the common denominator where analysis is done. In April 2012, the County Administrative Board of Blekinge found the situation so alarming that they asked the Swedish government to set up a closer investigation.

Interior of the Abbey, looking east Thorney Abbey, now the Church of St Mary and St Botolph, was a medieval monastic house established on the island of Thorney in The Fens of Cambridgeshire, England.  History  The earliest documentary sources refer to a mid-7th century hermitage destroyed by a Viking incursion in the late 9th century. A Benedictine monastery was founded in the 970s, and a huge rebuilding programme followed the Norman Conquest of 1066. A new church was begun under the abbacy of Gunther of Le Mans, appointed in 1085. It was in use by 1089, but not entirely finished until 1108. Henry I was a benefactor of the Abbey;Hollister, C. Warren Henry I Yale University Press 2001 pp.160-161 a writ survives ordering the return of the manor of Sawbridge in Warwickshire to the Abbey \\"and there is to be no complaint of injustice\\". The focus of the settlement shifted away from the fen edge in the late 12th or early 13th century, the earlier site becoming a rubbish dump, perhaps because of encroaching water. It was reoccupied in the 13th and 14th centuries, when clay layers were laid down to provide a firm foundation for the timber buildings. More substantial buildings were erected in the 16th century and these are thought to have been part of an expanding abbey complex, perhaps for use as guesthouses, stables, or workshops. Many of Thorney Abbey's buildings disappeared without trace after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Its last abbot, Robert Blythe, was a supporter of the King, having signed a letter to the pope urging that his divorce should be allowed. He was rewarded with a pension of ¬£200 a year. The abbey was surrendered to the king's commissioners on 1 December 1539, and most its buildings were later demolished and the stone reused. The site was granted to John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford in 1549/50. The nave of the church survived, and was restored as the Parish Church of St Mary and St Botolph in 1638. At this date the aisles were demolished and the arcade openings walled up. Some stained glass was installed that possibly came from the Steelyard, the London trading base of the Hanseatic League. The present east end, in the Norman style, is by Edward Blore, and dates from 1840-1. The church is a Grade I listed building. There is a model of the monastery in the Thorney Museum. The name Thorney Abbey is also given to a Grade I listed house, partly late sixteenth and partly seventeenth century, in the village of Thorney. Burials As a large abbey of Anglo-Saxon England a number of saints have been buried and venerated in Thorney, including: *Athwulf of Thorney *Benedict Biscop *Botwulf of Thorney *Cissa of Crowland *Herefrith of Thorney *Huna of Thorney *Tancred of Thorney 9th century East Anglian martyr *Torthred of Thorney brother of Tancred *Tova *Wihtred of Thorney *Albinus of ThorneyCharles H.

Excavation  Excavation was undertaken in 2002 prior to redevelopment, by University of Leicester Archaeological Services. This focused on the northern edge of the former island. As well as pottery, animal bone and roofing material, a large deposit of 13th and 14th century painted glass was found in and around the buildings. The intricate designs were of very high quality.

The resulting encoded material is conceptually similar to the pattern of magnetic field orientations within the magnetic domains of a ferromagnet, and thus may be considered as a possible technology for computer storage media. The encoded regions are optically active (have a varying index of refraction) and thus may be \\"read out\\" optically. Encoding process The encoding process proceeds by application of ultraviolet light tuned to the absorption band associated with the transition of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. During UV application, an external electric field is used to modify the electric dipole moment of regions of the ferroelectric material that are exposed to UV light. By this process, a pattern of local electric field orientations can be encoded. Technically, the encoding effect proceeds by the creation of a population inversion between the valence and conduction bands, with the resulting creation of plasmons. During this time, ferroelectric perovskite materials can be forced to change geometry by the application of an electric field. The encoded regions become optically active due to the Pockels effect. Decoding process The pattern of ferroelectric domain orientations can be read out optically. The refractive index of the ferroelectric material at wavelengths from near-infrared through to near-ultraviolet is affected by the electric field within the material. A changing pattern of electric field domains within a ferroelectric substrate results in different regions of the substrate having different refractive indices. Under these conditions, the substrate behaves as a diffraction grating, allowing the pattern of domains to be inferred from the interference pattern present in the transmitted readout beam.

The club has grown dramatically since its inception and now fields junior teams from U6's to U17's. The senior club has become one of NSW strongest and now fields 6 senior teams in the NSW Suburban Rugby Union 1st Division Kentwell Cup. The Kentwell Cup is the second tier of club Rugby and is a Sydney wide competition. History In 1957 the Forest Rugby story began when a small group of men from the Frenchs Forest area, who used to meet for a drink after work in a Chatswood Hotel, decided they would like their sons to play rugby. As there was no organised rugby in the area, one of the fathers Bill Holmes, formed a team of boys to enter the Gordon, Northern Districts competition. The team was coached by Dick Healy and managed by Bill Holmes and Les Cowan. By 1958 the number of players, officials and supporters increased and it was decided to form a club. The first meeting was held in Soldiers Hall, Forestville on 10 February 1958. The club's colours of Bottle Green and White were chosen. The home ground would be French's Forest Primary School Oval. Throughout the 60's the club progressed further by drafting and having accepted a constitution, increasing their junior teams to 14 and re-locating to the permanent home ground of The War Memorial Playing Fields, Melwood Oval, Forestville. Notably, in 1966 the club's numbers had grown to 300 with 16 teams being fielded and Peter Sullivan being the first player from the club to be selected to play for NSW (and later went on to captain Australia). In 1972 the club entered its first team in the Sydney Sub-District Competition where they stayed until 1979 where they were invited to join the newly formed 3rd Division. After several years of playing in the higher division it was decided to return to Sub-District competition in 1982 after difficulty fielding teams in all 4 grades due to the vast amount of traveling involved. The club has been a centre of community activity throughout the 80's, 90's and into the millennium staging junior rugby training camps, golden oldies tournaments and fierce and competitive local rugby.

The total time of this kind of shower can last less than two minutes ‚Äì using an initial thirty seconds or so to get wet, followed by shutting off the water, using soap and shampoo and lathering, then rinsing for a minute or less. Navy showers originated on naval ships, where supplies of fresh water were often scarce. Using this method, crew members were able to stay clean, while conserving their limited water supply. The concept has also been adopted by some other people who wish to conserve water and the energy needed to heat the water, for both environmental and economic reasons. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, water heating is typically the second-largest energy expense in homes (after space heating). In colloquial terms, a GI shower takes place when a soldier or sailor is dirty, won't wash, and his fed up fellow troops hold him down and scrub him with heavy duty scrub brushes and cleanser. Maritime cruisers often take navy showers when they are not in a port with easy access to fresh water.

The most recent Survey (2006) found that 87.5 million U.S. residents 16 years old and older participated in wildlife-related recreation and spent $122.3 billion on their activities. During that year, 30.0 million people fished, 12.5 million hunted, and 71.1 million participated in at least one type of wildlife-watching activity such as observing, feeding, or photographing birds and other wildlife in the United States. Data Collected The Survey collects information on the number of anglers, hunters, and wildlife watchers; how often they participate; and how much they spend on their activities in the United States. The most recent Survey focuses on 2006 participation and expenditures by persons 16 years of age and older. The information is presented at both the national and state level. In addition to 2006 estimates, the Survey also provides trend information that can be directly compared with results from the 1991, 1996, and 2001 Survey reports. Due to methodological changes to improve accuracy, results from Surveys conducted earlier than 1991 should not be directly compared. =Fishing= Three types of fishing are reported: (1) freshwater, excluding Great Lakes, (2) Great Lakes, and (3) saltwater. Anglers include not only licensed hook and line anglers, but also those who have no license and those who use special methods such as fishing with spears. Results are given for total participants, days of participation, number of trips, and expenditures. =Hunting= Four types of hunting are reported: (1) big game, (2) small game, (3) migratory bird, and (4) other animals. Hunters include not only licensed hunters using rifles and shotguns but also those who had no license and those who hunted with a bow and arrow, primitive firearm, or pistol or handgun. Results are given for total participants, days of participation, number of trips, and expenditures. =Wildlife Watching= Two types of wildlife watching are reported: (1) away- from-home (formally nonresidential) activities and (2) around-the-home (formally residential) activities. The 2006 Survey uses a strict definition of wildlife watching. Participants must either take a \\"special interest\\" in wildlife around their homes or take a trip for the \\"primary purpose\\" of wildlife watching. Secondary wildlife watching, such as incidentally observing wildlife while pleasure driving, is not included. Results are given for total participants, days of participation, number of trips, and expenditures. =Demographic Data= The Survey also collects demographic data for anglers, hunters and wildlife watchers. This information is broken down into a select group of characteristics including density of residence, size of residence, geographic region, age, sex, ethnicity, race, income, and education. Uses of the Survey The Service provides reports, brochures, news releases, speeches, and interviews about current use and trend information with the Survey results. Other Federal agencies, like land managing and water development agencies, use the data on participation rates, species sought, and types of resources used to formulate policies, programs, and plans related to recreational fish and wildlife uses. Federal regulatory, permitting, and environmental agencies rely on the economic data for estimating damages to fish and wildlife resources, and for determining the benefits and costs of projects affecting natural resources. Data are used in evaluating alternative plans and their environmental impacts. State fish and wildlife agencies, in conjunction with their fishery and wildlife sections, use the Survey data for program planning, development, management, and evaluation. Other non-federal conservation organizations, researchers, and trade and manufacturing associations rely on the Survey data too. They also participate in identifying priorities for data collection and streamlining.

Niebaum acquired his maritime schooling in Helsinki, Finland. By the end of 1860s, he had become one of the world's leading fur traders. Among his many known accomplishments, Niebaum founded the Alaskan Commercial Company in San Francisco, California. He also prepared some of the first official maps of the coastline of Alaska. As the Consul of Russia in the United States in 1867 (at the time Finland was an autonomous Grand Duchy of Russia), Niebaum helped explore the territory and promoted ratification of the Alaska purchase. Origins and name Born in Helsinki, Finland, as Gustaf Ferdinand Nybom to a Swedish-speaking family. This spelling of his name is rendered in the original Swedish form. As a 16-year-old Gustaf first came to Alaska on a voyage aboard a ship owned by the Russian-American Company. During this period both Alaska and Finland were regions under Russian control. On his return he studied for his Master's exam in Helsinki and was soon back in Alaska working as a helmsman. He later advanced to the rank of captain. Alaska came under American control in October 1867 and Nybom formed a new company with five partners, the Hansen, Nybom & Co, and they became wealthy seal-skin traders. They sold Alaskan seal skins in San Francisco and made California their new home. In time, after many years of trading and building his wealth, Gustaf Nybom eventually changed his name to the German form of Gustave Niebaum. It is believed that he did so to fit in with his many partners who were German Jews. Some of his German partners had seen the potential for planting wine grapes in the fertile Napa Valley and had done so since the 1860s. Gustave married a German-American woman in 1873. Niebaum and his wife purchased 450 acres on prime land in 1879 and began making their own wine. Winery In 1879 Niebaum established Inglenook Winery in Rutherford, California, a small village in Napa Valley. Captain Niebaum had originally wanted to establish a fine winery in France, but his California- born wife objected to long ocean voyages and preferred Napa instead. A number of Niebaum's colleagues and employees from the Alaska Commercial Company also joined him in creating Napa County wineries of their own - Benson at Far Niente and later on John Parrott's son Tiburcio. (John Parrott was the financier behind the Alaska Commercial Company). Niebaum's employee Hamden McIntyre was not an architect but he designed gravity flow wineries for Inglenook and Far Niente along with other wineries of the decade. From the beginning Inglenook was Niebaum's pride and joy and he worked hard to create quality wines, taking frequent trips to Europe to observe vineyards and winery practices (in Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Hungary and Italy), and then importing a wide variety of European vines and following high standards in winemaking. His wine library contained 600 books he collected on his travels. At first, Black Malvoisie, a low quality grape, which he inherited on the property, was replaced with Sauvignon Blanc purchased in San Jose. Later when he brought back cuttings from Europe, he planted Pinot Noir, Grenache, Carignan, Tannat, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot, and Malbec as well as the white wine grapes White Riesling, Semillon, Chenin Blanc, Burger and Chalosse. Extreme care was taken during the winemaking process to remove stems and leaves from the grapes, and he was the only Napa vintner of his time to bottle his wines on his estate (until he could no longer afford to). (Most wineries shipped their wine in bulk.) The result was that Inglenook wines became world-renowned, winning gold medals in the World's Fair of Paris in 1889 and maintaining their reputation for high quality through the decades into the 1919 Panama-Pacific International Exhibition in San Francisco where Inglenook wines won 19 gold medals, far surpassing any other California winery. Niebaum died in 1908, but his wife hired competent managers notably Carl Bundschu, to continue the enterprise. After Prohibition, operation of Niebaum's vineyards and winery passed on to his great nephew John Daniels, Jr., whom Bundschu had mentored, in 1939, following the death of Suzanne Niebaum, Gustave's widow, in 1938. The Daniel era lasted through 1964 when the winery was, tragically, sold to corporate interests. Francis Ford Coppola in 1975 with proceeds from The Godfather. Coppola released his first vintage in 1977 under the Niebaum-Coppola label. In 1995 Coppola purchased the remaining acreage and chateau style winery which were part of the original Niebaum estate. In 2006 the winery was renamed Rubicon Estate Winery. In 2011, Coppola purchased the name Inglenook and reunited the winery, the vineyards and the brand name. In 2007, Gustave Niebaum was posthumously inducted into the Culinary Institute of America's Vintner's Hall of Fame. \\"Vintners Hall of Fame Inductees,\\" Culinary Institute of America Little Scandinavia of San Francisco At the time when Gustave Niebaum was busy conducting business in the San Francisco Bay Area and Alaska - from late 19th to early 20th century -, both places had considerably large Finnish settlements. As the Governor in Russian America from 1858 to 1864, Finnish Johan Hampus Furuhjelm helped pave way for the Alaska Purchase, just as Gustave Niebaum did, as the Consul of Imperial Russia in the United States in 1867 (at the time Finland was the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland of Russia) ‚Äî when Alaska was purchased to become part of the United States. During his Russian America governorship, Furuhjelm also put an end to the hostilities with the indigenous peoples of Alaska, and he succeeded in abolishing the Alaskan Ice Treaty with San Francisco. According to a contract which had been signed, Russian America had to deliver a certain amount of ice to San Francisco at a fixed price. The problem was that the product melted down on the way to the warmer climates. The ice contract became very awkward for the Russian colony. Furuhjelm arranged for a new contract to sell ice to San Francisco: 3'000 tons at $25.00 a ton. The Russian-American Company had been established in 1802. Finns and Swedes and other Lutherans who had worked for the company had built the Sitka Lutheran Church in Alaska in 1840. It was the first Protestant church on the northwestern Pacific Coast. The officially registered Finnish Club No. 1 was established in the Castro District of San Francisco in 1882. Soon after, two \\"Finnish Halls\\" were built nearby. One was located at the corner of 24th Street and Hoffman Street. The other hall was located on Flint Street, on the \\"Rocky Hill\\" above the Castro, an area densely Finnish-populated at the time - a Finn Town. Before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, nearly all the kids attending the McKinley school (now McKinley Elementary School) at 1025 14th Street (at Castro) were Finnish. Following the 1906 earthquake, a large amount of Finns of San Francisco the Bay Area moved to Berkeley, where many already had settled before. A large part of the early Berkeley population was of Finnish heritage.Lutheran Church of the Cross - homepage . This is the period when Finnila's Finnish Baths began serving customers in the Castro District. In 1906, St. Francis Lutheran Church was erected at 152 Church Street, between Market Street and Duboce Street.Francis Lutheran Church by San Francisco Conference of Lutheran Churches, ELCA. The construction work was completed by immigrants from the Nordic countries, where Lutheranism is the largest religious group. The project overseen primarily by Danes took place in the heart of what was then the Nordic-dominated Duboce-Market Street neighborhood of San Francisco. Facing the backside of St. Francis Lutheran Church, a small and light-colored Finnish church served Finnish speaking church-goers on the one block long side street. The 1943 novel Mama's Bank Account by Kathryn Forbes focused on a Norwegian family living in the area in the 1910s. Forbes' book served as the inspiration for John Van Druten's 1944 play I Remember Mama. The play was adapted to a Broadway theater production in 1944; to a movie in 1948; to a CBS Mama television series running from 1949 until 1957; to a Lux Radio Theater play in the late 1950s; and to a Broadway musical\\"I Remember Mama, 1979\\" Internet Broadway Database listing, accessed March 24, 2012. in 1979. In the early 20th century - especially from c. 1910 to 1920s - the Castro District of San Francisco and some of the surrounding area was known as Little Scandinavia, because of the large number of people of Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, and Finnish ancestry who lived there. The Cove on Castro used to be called The Norse Cove at the time. The Scandinavian Seamen's Mission operated for a long time on 15th Street, off Market Street, just around the corner from the Swedish-American Hall, which remains in the district. In 1920s - during the prohibition -, the downstairs of the Swedish- American Hall served as a speak-easy, one of many in the area. \\"Unlicensed saloons\\" were known as ‚Äòspeak-easies‚Äô, according to an 1889 newspaper. (A newspaper in Cheney, Washington). They were \\"so called because of the practice of speaking quietly about such a place in public, or when inside it, so as not to alert the police or neighbors.\\" Scandinavian-style \\"half-timber\\" construction can still be seen in some of the buildings along Market Street, between Castro and Church Streets. A restaurant called Scandinavian Deli operated for decades on Market Street, between Noe and Sanchez Streets, almost directly across the street from Finnila's.

It is a very popular insecticide brand in Pakistan.Reckitt Benckiser Pakistan Limited The brand has been represented in television commercials by cartoon antagonist, Louie the Fly. The majority of consumer reviews for the automatic indoor spray Naturgard are negative, with issues ranging from lack of effectiveness to health issues with pets and humans. In 1969, the Samuel Taylor company was bought by the British company Reckitt & Colman. Creation Mortein was made its first appearance as an insecticidal powder in the 1870s by J. Hagemann, a German immigrant to Australia. It is believed said that Hagemann himself came up with the name Mortein, with a little help from his French wife. The word \\"Mortein\\" is a combination of the French word \\"mort\\" (dead) and the German word \\"ein\\" (one).. Hagemann used crushed chrysanthemum flowers to produce a pyrethrum extract powder. In the 1920s a squeeze puffer was developed. Hagemann introduced a liquid version in 1928, combining this with kerosene and had a flit gun designed which allowed the insecticide to be sprayed into the air or onto the pests themselveshttps://www.mortein.co.nz/about/about-mortein/. Slogan Mortein's slogan is \\"More smart, more safe, Mortein.\\" Formula Mortein \\"Insect Seeking Fly Spray\\" uses the active ingredients Allethrin (2.09 g/kg) and Resmethrin (0.39 g/kg), both Pyrethroid neuro-toxins. One study found an association between exposure to pyrethroids and attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in male, but not female, children. Another study found an association between exposure to pyrethroids and the prevalence of biochemical markers for ADHD in developing mice. There is evidence that continuous exposure to pyrethroid-based mosquito repellents can lead to adverse health effects. Studies have shown significant increase in the levels of plasma glucose, phospholipids, nitrite and nitrate, and lipidperoxides with a decrease in plasma cholesterol. It is also shown that inhaling d-trans-Allethrin can irritate the nose, throat and lungs. High exposure may cause headache, dizziness, irritability, seizures, and a loss of consciousness. Exposure may also cause a skin allergy or asthma-like allergy, and damage the liver and kidneys. Pyrethroids break down in the environment after one or two days.

It has two extinct relatives from the Mascarenes and three extant ones from other islands. It is the type species of the genus of blue pigeons, Alectroenas. It had white hackles around the head, neck and breast and blue plumage on the body, and it was red on the tail and the bare parts of the head. These colours were thought similar to those of the Dutch flag, a resemblance reflected in some of the bird's names. The males had red foreheads, and the juveniles may have been partially green. It was 30 cm (12 in) long and larger and more robust than any other blue pigeon species. It could raise its hackles into a ruff, which it used for display. Its call sounded like \\"barf barf\\" and it also made a cooing noise. It fed on fruits, nuts, and molluscs, and was once widespread in the forests of Mauritius. The bird was first mentioned in the 17th century and was described several times thereafter, but very few accounts describe the behaviour of living specimens. Several stuffed and at least one live specimen reached Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. Only three stuffed specimens exist today, and only one bird was ever depicted when alive. The species is thought to have become extinct in the 1830s due to deforestation and predation.  Taxonomy  Illustration of a stuffed specimen published with Sonnerat's 1782 description The first record of the Mauritius blue pigeon is two sketches in the 1601‚Äì1603 journal of the Dutch ship Gelderland. The birds appear to have been freshly killed or stunned. The drawings were made by the Dutch artist Joris Joostensz Laerle on Mauritius, but were not published until 1969. Fran√ßois Cauche in 1651 briefly mentions \\"white, black and red turtle doves\\", encountered in 1638, which is thought to be the first unequivocal mention of the bird. The next account is that of Jean-Fran√ßois Charpentier de Cossigny in the mid-18th century. The French naturalist Pierre Sonnerat described the bird in 1782, calling it Pigeon Hollandais (Dutch pigeon), a French vernacular name that derives from its red, white, and blue colouration, which reminded him of the Dutch flag (the French flag did not yet have these colours). He had collected two specimens during a voyage in 1774. These syntype specimens were deposited in the Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris. By 1893, only one of them, specimen MNHN n¬∞C.G. 2000-727, still existed, and had been damaged by sulphuric acid in an attempt at fumigation. Since Sonnerat named and described them in French, the scientific naming of the bird was left to the Tyrolean naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, who did not observe a specimen himself, but Latinised Sonnerat's description in 1786. He named the bird Columba nitidissima, which means \\"most brilliant pigeon\\". When German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin redescribed the bird with the species name franciae (\\"of France\\") in 1789, he referred to the French tricolour which had just been flown for the first time. Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre used the name batavica (\\"the Dutch one\\") in his description in 1790. In 1840 the English zoologist George Robert Gray named a new genus, Alectroenas, for the Mauritius blue pigeon; alektruon in Greek means domestic cock, and oinas means dove. Alectroenas nitidissima is the type species of the genus, which includes all blue pigeons. The specific name was emended from A. nitidissimus to A. nitidissima by the IOC World Bird List in 2012. Another skin arrived at the Paris museum in 1800, collected by Colonel M. Mathieu for the French ornithologist Louis Dufresne. It was sold in 1819 among other items, was sent to Edinburgh, and is now in the National Museum of Scotland as specimen MU No. 624. It was not identified as a Mauritius blue pigeon until the British ornithologist Alfred Newton saw it in 1879. The last specimen recorded was shot in Savanne in 1826 and given to Julien Desjardins, founder of the Mauritius Natural History Museum in Port Louis, where it is still located, though in poor condition. Only these three taxidermic specimens still exist. Subfossil remains of the Mauritius blue pigeon were collected in the Mare aux Songes swamp by Th√©odore Sauzier in 1889. More were collected by Etienne Thirioux around 1900. They are thought to have been found near Le Pouce mountain and Plaine des Roches. = Evolution = Alectroenas blue pigeons are closely interrelated and occur widely throughout islands in the western Indian Ocean. They are allopatric and can therefore be regarded as a superspecies. There are three extant species: the Madagascan blue pigeon (A. madagascariensis), the Comoros blue pigeon (A. sganzini), and the Seychelles blue pigeon (A. pulcherrima). The three Mascarene islands were each home to a species, all of which are extinct: the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Rodrigues blue pigeon (A. payandeei), and the R√©union blue pigeon (A. sp.). Compared with other pigeons, the blue pigeons are medium to large, stocky, and have longer wings and tails. All the species have distinct mobile hackles on the head and neck. The tibiotarsus is comparatively long and the tarsometatarsus short. The blue pigeons may have colonised the Mascarenes, the Seychelles or a now submerged hot spot island by \\"island hopping\\". They may have evolved into a distinct genus there before reaching Madagascar. Their closest genetic relative is the cloven-feathered dove of New Caledonia (Drepanoptila holosericea), from which they separated 8‚Äì9 million years ago. Their ancestral group appears to be the fruit doves (Ptilinopus) of Southeast Asia and Oceania.  Description  Life drawing of a male displaying its head feathers, ca. 1790, by G. Haasbroek The feathers on the head, neck and breast of the Mauritius blue pigeon were silvery white, long, stiffened and pointed, especially around the neck. A patch of bright red, naked skin surrounded the eyes, and extended across the cheeks to the beak, which was greenish with a dark tip. The plumage of the body was indigo, and the back, scapular feathers and wings were metallic blue. The base of the outer rectrices was partially blackish blue. The tail feathers and tail coverts were maroon. The legs were dark slate-grey. The iris was reddish orange and had an inner yellow ring. The bird was 30 cm (12 in) in length, the wings were 208 mm (8.2 in), the tail was 132 mm (5.2 in), the culmen was 25 mm (1 in), and the tarsals were 28 mm (1.10 in). It was the largest and most robust member of its genus, and the hackles were longer and covered a larger area than in other blue pigeons. Subfossil tarsometatarsus leg-bone in Naturalis Biodiversity Center Unlike the three surviving skins of Mauritius blue pigeons, one of two illustrations (the other is in black-and-white) of a live individual kept in the Netherlands around 1790 shows a red forehead. Both sexes of the Seychelles blue pigeon also have red foreheads, and the English palaeontologist Julian Hume has suggested that the image depicts a male, which was described as \\"infinitely more handsome\\" than the female by Cossigny in the mid-18th century. Hume therefore interprets the three surviving skins as belonging to female specimens. A Mauritian woman recalling observations of Mauritius blue pigeons around 1815 mentioned green as one of its colours. Juvenile Seychelles and Comoro blue pigeons have green feathers, so this may also have been the case for juvenile Mauritian pigeons. Some depictions and descriptions have shown the legs of Mauritius blue pigeons as red, like those of the Madagascar blue pigeon. The legs of the Paris specimen were painted red when the original colour faded, presumably on the basis of such accounts. The legs of the two other surviving specimens have not been painted and have faded to a yellowish brown. This feature is not mentioned in contemporary accounts, and such depictions are thought to be erroneous. Some modern restorations of the bird have also depicted it with facial crenulations, like those of the Seychelles blue pigeon. This feature was unknown from contemporary accounts, until the 1660s report of Johannes Pretorius about his stay on Mauritius was published in 2015, where he mentioned the bird's \\"warty face\\".  Behaviour and ecology  1907 illustration of the Paris specimen by John Gerrard Keulemans; the red legs are an inaccuracy Few descriptions of the behaviour of Mauritius blue pigeons are known; unpublished notes by Desjardins are now lost. An individual was brought to the Netherlands around 1790, where it survived in the menagerie of William V, Prince of Orange for three months before dying of oedema. The only two known life drawings of the species (by G. Haasbroek) depict this individual. The illustrations show a displaying male raising its hackles into a ruff. This is a characteristic behaviour of other blue pigeons, too, and they can also vibrate their hackles. The following description of the display behaviour and calls of this individual was written on the back on the coloured drawing by Arnout Vosmaer, director of the menagerie: Life drawings of a male with raised and lowered hackles, c. 1790 The Mauritius blue pigeon probably lived in pairs or small groups in humid, mountainous evergreen forests, like their extant relatives. Subfossil remains have been found in mid-west, mid-east and south- east Mauritius, indicating that the bird was once widespread. By 1812, the French naturalist Jacques G√©rard Milbert stated that solitary individuals were found in river valleys. They probably became rarer during French rule in Mauritius (1715‚Äì1810), as lowland areas of the island were almost completely deforested during this time. Many other endemic species of Mauritius became extinct after the arrival of man, so the ecosystem of the island is severely damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, forests covered Mauritius entirely, but very little remains today because of deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. The Mauritius blue pigeon lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the dodo, the red rail, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the broad-billed parrot, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck and the Mauritius night heron. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the saddle- backed Mauritius giant tortoise, the domed Mauritius giant tortoise, the Mauritian giant skink and the Round Island burrowing boa. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Mauritius and R√©union but became extinct in both islands. Some plants, such as Casearia tinifolia and the palm orchid, have also become extinct. = Diet = 1811 illustration by Pauline Knip and C√©sar Macret Fruits and nuts were probably the mainstay of the Mauritius blue pigeon's diet, and like other blue pigeons, it may have occupied the upper canopy, and migrated seasonally to where food was available. Cossigny dissected a specimen in the mid-18th century and later sent it and its stomach contents to the French scientist Ren√© Antoine Ferchault de R√©aumur with a letter describing his findings. The gizzard and crop contained four \\"nuts\\", which Cossigny was told were the seeds of either Calophyllum tacamahaca or Labourdonnaisia calophylloides. The Comoro and Seychelles blue pigeons also feed on C. tacamahaca, and the strong gizzard of the former helps in the digestion of the seeds. In 1812 Jacques G√©rard Milbert provided the only description of the behaviour of the bird in the wild: The claim that the bird fed on river molluscs was criticised by the French zoologists Alphonse Milne-Edwards and Emile Oustalet in 1893, with the later agreement of the American ornithologist James Greenway in 1967, as blue pigeons are principally arboreal. It has since been pointed out that other mainly frugivorous pigeons, such as species of Ptilinopus and Gallicolumba, do occasionally eat molluscs and other invertebrates. The two species of Nesoenas have also been reported as eating freshwater snails, and one was seen hunting tadpoles. Milbert may in any case have been referring to arboreal snails, as extant blue pigeons rarely land on the ground. A diet of snails would have provided the birds with calcium for egg production. Pretorius attempted to keep juvenile and adult Mauritius blue pigeons in captivity, but all his specimens died. This is probably because the species was almost exclusively frugivorous, like extant blue pigeons. Extinction Sketches of recently killed specimens on Mauritius, from the Gelderland journal, 1601 The Mauritius blue pigeon coexisted with humans for 200 years. Its decline can be correlated with deforestation, which is also the main threat to extant blue pigeons. Little lowland forest was left on the island by 1859. Frugivorous birds often need a large area for foraging and move between forest types to feed on different types of food, which grow irregularly. Other blue pigeons perch on bare branches, making them vulnerable to hunters. Cossigny noted that the bird had become rare by 1755, but were common 23 years before, and attributed the decline to deforestation and hunting by escaped slaves. On the other hand, the French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre stated they were still common in 1790. The Mauritius blue pigeon was not seasonally poisonous like the pink pigeon, which still survives on Mauritius today, but it was reputed to be. In spite of this, it was hunted for food, and some early accounts praised the flavour of the bird. Extant blue pigeons are also considered good food, and are heavily hunted as a result, and it appears another population of them was hunted to extinction from the Farquhar and Providence islands. The Mauritius blue pigeon was easy to catch due to island tameness. 1808 illustration by J. Reinold The last confirmed specimen was shot in the Savanne district in 1826, but the 1832 report by Desjardins suggests that some could still be found in remote forests in the centre of the island. Convinced that the pigeon still survived, the British ornithologist Edward Newton interviewed two inhabitants of Mauritius about the Mauritius blue pigeon in 1863, and these accounts suggest that the bird survived until at least 1837. The first interviewee claimed he had killed two specimens when the British Colonel James Simpson stayed on the island, which was 1826‚Äì37. The second was a woman who had last seen a bird around this time, and recalled hunts of it in approximately 1815, in a swampy area near Black River Gorges, south western Mauritius: It can be concluded that the Mauritius blue pigeon became extinct in the 1830s. Apart from habitat destruction and hunting, introduced predators, mainly crab-eating macaques, were probably also responsible.

The dam is located on the Helmand River 100 miles (161 km) north-west of Kandahar and is operated by the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority. It has a dual function, to provide electricity and to irrigate some 650,000 acres (1800 km2) of an otherwise arid land. Water discharging from the dam traverses some 300 miles (500 km) of downstream irrigation canals feeding farmland. it produces 52.5 megawatts of electricity. The dam is high and long, with a gross storage capacity of of fresh water. The dam controls the output of the main watershed which feeds the Sistan Basin. History Final studies for the dam began in 1946 and a preliminary design was crafted in 1950. The dam was built between 1951 and 1953 by the Morrison- Knudsen firm as part of the Helmand Valley Authority project. In 1975, USAID commissioned the initial installation of two 16.5 MW generating units in a powerhouse constructed at the toe of the dam. This first stage powerhouse was actually constructed to house three equally sized units. Only units 1 and 3 were installed originally. A 2012 aerial photo showing a small portion of the reservoir along with the dam (left) and the spillway (right) When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979, the contractors left. They had intended to raise the dam by 2 meters in order to increase the available water for power production and irrigation. They were also excavating an emergency spillway which was never completed. Gates were also never installed in the service spillway so the dam passes all water in the reservoir above elevation 1033.5 meters. Completion of the spillway gates would increase the total storage capacity of the reservoir by to . The Kajaki dam powerhouse was a bombing target of the US Air Force during their attack on Afghanistan in October 2001. With funding from USAID, World Bank and other donors, Units 1 and 3 were fully rehabilitated and the power station had an installed capacity of 33 MW. Unit 1 was operational in September 2005 and Unit 3 in October 2009. The Unit 3 rehabilitation began in May 2006, with a scheduled return to service in early 2007. The new 18.5 MW Unit 2 turbine/generator had been contracted to China Machine Building International Corporation, which is headquartered in Beijing. The work was to be supervised by Montgomery Watson Harza and was planned to be completed by June 2007 but the work was not completed. In February 2007, the Kajakai Dam was the subject of fighting between coalition forces and Taliban insurgents, as part of Operation Kryptonite.Taliban flee battle using children as shields - NATO, February 14, 2007 According to the governor of Helmand province, Assadullah Wafa, over 700 Taliban insurgents (including Pakistanis, Chechens and Uzbeks) coming from neighboring Pakistan fought against over 300 coalition troops.US defense secretary in Pakistan, February 12, 2007 Most of the coalition troops were Dutch and British.

As a critical component of the Southern Electrical Power System, the capacity of the Kajaki plant would be expanded to 51 MW with a future potential for an additional 100 MW. The Kajaki power station Inside the Kajaki power station A series of power lines and substation connected to the Kajaki hydroelectric powerplant. In late August 2008 a contingent of ISAF and Afghan troops successfully transported the third turbine (Unit 2) from Kandahar to the Kajaki Dam. The operation was British-led and codenamed Operation Oqab Tsuka, meaning \\"Eagle's Summit\\" in Pashto.British Troops Complete Operation to Deliver Turbine A BBC report on the unassembled and uninstalled turbine in June 2011 estimated project completion in late 2013. Despite the turbine being delivered onsite in 2008, over 7 years later in September 2015 it had still not been installed, as its installation required 700 tonnes of cement which could not be delivered to the dam due to attacks by the Taliban. In February 2015, USAID anticipated completion in 2016. When the turbine comes online, and when a new grid of power lines are established to distribute the power, it was expected that the dam would be able to provide 51 megawatts of power.UK Troops in Huge Turbine Mission The turbine was finally commissioned in October 2016, adding 18.5 MW of power output. The project reduces reliance on more expensive and dirtier diesel generation, and nearly doubled the amount of renewable energy distributed to Kandahar. The Afghan electric authority assumed full responsibility for operations and maintenance in March 2017. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) had several concurrent project plans associated with the Kajaki Dam with a total program amount of approximately $205 million. Together, the projects would improve water flow for irrigation and electric power generation. The first phase would repair the dam's intake structure. The gates did not close, so no maintenance could be performed on the gates or the irrigation outlet tunnels. The project included the rehabilitation of existing intake structure components: intake bulkhead gate, steel sliding gate, crane, crane hoist assembly, lifting assembly, embedded parts, and hydrology gauge. The second phase would rehabilitate the three 84-inch roto valves inside the irrigation tunnel and three 84-inch jet valves at the outlet end of the irrigation tunnel. A roto valve is designed to open and close relatively easily, despite high fluid pressure. Jet valves are installed as part of the outlet structure, and decrease the pressure of the water exiting the bottom of the dam, which prevents erosion and scouring. Another part of the project was to evaluate the current condition of inoperable piezometers at the dam and seek bids to repair or replace them. =Southern Electrical Power System= This two-phased project would improve access to electric power for residents of Helmand and Kandahar provinces. The SEPS‚ÄîHelmand phase included rebuilding the Kajaki Substation; replacing the 20kV line from the Kajaki Substation to Tangi; a new switchyard at Tangi; a new substation at Musa Qal'eh; a new 110kV line from Kajaki Substation to Musa Qal'eh Substation; a new 20kV line from Kajaki Substation to Kajaki Village, and the rebuilding of a 110kV line from Kajaki Substation to Sangin. The project also included rebuilding the Sangin North Substation, a new substation at Sangin South, rebuilding a 110kV line from Sangin to Durai Junction, and rebuilding a 110kV line from Durai Junction to Lashkar Gah. USACE awarded the project to Perini Management Services, Inc. of Framingham, Mass., with a 550-day period of performance. The SEPS-Kandahar project included repairing an existing 110kV line from Durai Junction to Kandahar City, constructing new substations at Maiwand and Pushmool, and upgrading substations at Breshna Kot. These projects would improve distribution of electrical power to the people of the Lashkar Gah area in Helmand province, and the Kandahar City area. In October 2017, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction reported that the project was not complete, and at risk of not being sustained once completed and transferred to the Afghan government. Water supply accord Under a monarchy-era accord signed between Iran and Afghanistan in 1972, Afghanistan agreed to release water at a rate of at least . In 1998, when Iran threatened to attack in retaliation for the killing of Iranians who were claimed to be diplomats in Mazari Sharif when the Taliban retook that city from the Northern Alliance the second time, the Taliban briefly stopped the flow of water to Iran, using a canal to divert the Helmand's flow southward into the Gowd Zerrah Depression. During that time the Helmand valley was going through a five-year drought. As a result, Iran's Hamun-e Helmand lake dried up, as did regional pastures, leading to the death of flora, fauna, cattle and birds in the Sistan and Baluchestan Province of Iran.Hirmand River's water to flow into Iran again, soon: Afghan source, December 12, 2002 Time Series of Water in Lake Hamoun, Iran/Afghanistan In film *The American effort to build the dam is mentioned in Adam Curtis's 2015 documentary Bitter Lake.

It is common to coastal tropical and subtropical waters around the world, including brackish habitats. Genetic analyses have revealed substantial variation within this species, with populations from the western Atlantic Ocean isolated and distinct from those in the rest of its range. The blacktip shark has a stout, fusiform body with a pointed snout, long gill slits, and no ridge between the dorsal fins. Most individuals have black tips or edges on the pectoral, dorsal, pelvic, and caudal fins. It usually attains a length of . Swift, energetic piscivores, blacktip sharks are known to make spinning leaps out of the water while attacking schools of small fish. Their demeanor has been described as \\"timid\\" compared to other large requiem sharks. Both juveniles and adults form groups of varying size. Like other members of its family, the blacktip shark is viviparous; females bear one to 10 pups every other year. Young blacktip sharks spend the first months of their lives in shallow nurseries, and grown females return to the nurseries where they were born to give birth themselves. In the absence of males, females are also capable of asexual reproduction. Normally wary of humans, blacktip sharks can become aggressive in the presence of food and have been responsible for a number of attacks on people. This species is of importance to both commercial and recreational fisheries across many parts of its range, with its meat, skin, fins, and liver oil used. It has been assessed as Near Threatened by the IUCN, on the basis of its low reproductive rate and high value to fishers. Taxonomy The blacktip shark was first described by French zoologist Achille Valenciennes as Carcharias (Prionodon) limbatus in Johannes M√ºller and Friedrich Henle's 1839 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen. The type specimens were two individuals caught off Martinique, both of which have since been lost. Later authors moved this species to the genus Carcharhinus.Curtis, T. Biological Profiles: Blacktip Shark . Florida Museum of Natural History Ichthyology Department. Retrieved on April 27, 2009. The specific epithet limbatus is Latin for \\"bordered\\", referring to the black edges of this shark's fins. Other common names used for the blacktip shark include blackfin shark, blacktip whaler, common or small blacktip shark, grey shark, and spotfin ground shark. Phylogeny and evolution The closest relatives of the blacktip shark were originally thought to be the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides) and the spinner shark (C. brevipinna), due to similarities in morphology and behavior. However, this interpretation has not been borne out by studies of mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA, which instead suggest affinity with the blacknose shark (C. acronotus). More work is required to fully resolve the relationship between the blacktip shark and other Carcharhinus species. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA has also revealed two distinct lineages within this species, one occupying the western Atlantic and the other occupying the eastern Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. This suggests that Indo-Pacific blacktip sharks are descended from those in the eastern Atlantic, while the western Atlantic sharks became isolated by the widening Atlantic Ocean on one side and the formation of the Isthmus of Panama on the other. Blacktip sharks from these two regions differ in morphology, coloration, and life history characteristics, and the eastern Atlantic lineage may merit species status. Fossil teeth belonging to this species have been found in Early Miocene (23-16 Ma) deposits in Delaware and Florida. Description The blacktip shark has a robust, streamlined body with a long, pointed snout and relatively small eyes. The five pairs of gill slits are longer than those of similar requiem shark species. The jaws contain 15 tooth rows on either side, with two symphysial teeth (at the jaw midline) in the upper jaw and one symphysial tooth in the lower jaw. The teeth are broad-based with a high, narrow cusp and serrated edges. The first dorsal fin is tall and falcate (sickle-shaped) with a short free rear tip; no ridge runs between the first and second dorsal fins. The large pectoral fins are falcate and pointed. The coloration is gray to brown above and white below, with a conspicuous white stripe running along the sides. The pectoral fins, second dorsal fin, and the lower lobe of the caudal fin usually have black tips. The pelvic fins and rarely the anal fin may also be black-tipped. The first dorsal fin and the upper lobe of the caudal fin typically have black edges. Some larger individuals have unmarked or nearly unmarked fins. Blacktip sharks can temporarily lose almost all their colors during blooms, or \\"whitings\\", of coccolithophores.Martin, R.A. Albinism in Sharks. ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research.

Carcharhinus limbatus lower teeth2.jpgLower teeth Carcharhinus limbatus upper teeth2.jpgUpper teeth Distribution and habitat A blacktip shark swimming in murky water off Oahu, Hawaii The blacktip shark has a worldwide distribution in tropical and subtropical waters. In the Atlantic, it is found from Massachusetts to Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, and from the Mediterranean Sea, Madeira, and the Canary Islands to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It occurs all around the periphery of the Indian Ocean, from South Africa and Madagascar to the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent, to Southeast Asia. In the western Pacific, it is found from the Ryukyu Islands of Japan to northern Australia, including southern China, the Philippines and Indonesia. In the eastern Pacific, it occurs from Southern California to Peru. It has also been reported at a number of Pacific islands, including New Caledonia, Tahiti, the Marquesas, Hawaii, Revillagigedo, and the Gal√°pagos. Most blacktip sharks are found in water less than deep over continental and insular shelves, though they may dive to . Favored habitats are muddy bays, island lagoons, and the drop-offs near coral reefs; they are also tolerant of low salinity and enter estuaries and mangrove swamps. Although an individual may be found some distance offshore, blacktip sharks do not inhabit oceanic waters. Seasonal migration has been documented for the population off the east coast of the United States, moving north to North Carolina in the summer and south to Florida in the winter. Biology and ecology The blacktip shark is an extremely fast, energetic predator that is usually found in groups of varying size. Segregation by sex and age does not occur; adult males and nonpregnant females are found apart from pregnant females, and both are separated from juveniles. In Terra Ceia Bay, Florida, a nursery area for this species, juvenile blacktips form aggregations during the day and disperse at night. They aggregate most strongly in the early summer when the sharks are youngest, suggesting that they are seeking refuge from predators (mostly larger sharks) in numbers. Predator avoidance may also be the reason why juvenile blacktips do not congregate in the areas of highest prey density in the bay. Adults have no known predators. Known parasites of the blacktip shark include the copepods Pandarus sinuatus and P. smithii, and the monogeneans Dermophthirius penneri and Dionchus spp., which attach the shark's skin. This species is also parasitized by nematodes in the family Philometridae (genus Philometra), which infest the ovaries. =Behaviour= Blacktip sharks are social and usually found in groups. Like the spinner shark, the blacktip shark is known to leap out of the water and spin three or four times about its axis before landing. Some of these jumps are the end product of feeding runs, in which the shark corkscrews vertically through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air. Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also jump out of the water to dislodge attached sharksuckers, which irritate the shark's skin and compromise its hydrodynamic shape. The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3 m/s (21 ft/s). Blacktip sharks have a timid disposition and consistently lose out to Galapagos sharks (C. galapagensis) and silvertip sharks (C. albimarginatus) of equal size when competing for food. If threatened or challenged, they may perform an agonistic display: the shark swims towards the threat and then turns away, while rolling from side to side, lowering its pectoral fins, tilting its head and tail upwards, and making sideways biting motions. The entire sequence lasts around 25 seconds. This behavior is similar to the actions of a shark attempting to move a sharksucker; one of these behaviors possibly is derived from the other. =Feeding= Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet. A wide variety of fish have been recorded as prey for this species: sardines, herring, anchovies, ladyfish, sea catfish, cornetfish, flatfish, threadfins, mullet, mackerel, jacks, groupers, snook, porgies, mojarras, emperors, grunts, butterfish, tilapia, triggerfish, boxfish, and porcupinefish. They also feed on rays and skates, as well as smaller sharks such as smoothhounds and sharpnose sharks. Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken. In the Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), followed by the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus).Barry, K.P. (2002). Feeding habits of blacktip sharks, Carcharhinus limbatus, and Atlantic sharpnose sharks, Rhizoprionodon terraenovae, in Louisiana coastal waters. MS thesis, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge. Off South Africa, jacks and herring are the most important prey. Hunting peaks at dawn and dusk. The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of food are suddenly available, such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard. =Life history= As with other requiem sharks, the blacktip shark is viviparous. Females typically give birth to four to seven (range one to 10) pups every other year, making use of shallow coastal nurseries that offer plentiful food and fewer predators. Known nurseries include Pine Island Sound, Terra Ceia Bay, and Yankeetown along the Gulf Coast of Florida, Bulls Bay on the coast of South Carolina, and Pontal do Paran√° on the coast of Brazil. Although adult blacktip sharks are highly mobile and disperse over long distances, they are philopatric and return to their original nursery areas to give birth. This results in a series of genetically distinct breeding stocks that overlap in geographic range. Mating occurs from spring to early summer, and the young are born around the same time the following year after a gestation period of 10-12 months. Females have one functional ovary and two functional uteri; each uterus is separated into compartments with a single embryo inside each. The embryos are initially sustained by a yolk sac; in the 10th or 11th week of gestation, when the embryo measures 18-19 cm long (7.1-7.5 in), the supply of yolk is exhausted and the yolk sac develops into a placental connection that sustains the embryo until birth. The length at birth is off the eastern United States and off North Africa. The mortality rate in the first 15 months of life is 61-91%, with major threats being predation and starvation. The young remain in the nurseries until their first fall, when they migrate to their wintering grounds. The growth rate of this species slows with age: in the first six months, then a year until the second year, then a year until maturation, then a year for adults. The size at maturity varies geographically: males and females mature at and , respectively, in the northeastern Atlantic, and , respectively, in the Gulf of Mexico, respectively off South Africa, and , respectively, off North Africa. The age at maturation is 4-5 years for males and 7-8 years for females. The lifespan is at least 12 years. In 2007, a 9-year-old female blacktip shark at the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center was found to be pregnant with a single near-term female pup, despite having never mated with a male. Genetic analysis confirmed that her offspring was the product of automictic parthenogenesis, a form of asexual reproduction in which an ovum merges with a polar body to form a zygote without fertilization. Along with an earlier case of parthenogenesis in the bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo), this event suggests that asexual reproduction may be more widespread in sharks than previously thought. Human interactions The blacktip shark usually poses little danger to divers. Blacktip shark in UShaka Sea World Blacktip sharks showing curiosity towards divers has been reported, but they remain at a safe distance. Under most circumstances, these timid sharks are not regarded as highly dangerous to humans. However, they may become aggressive in the presence of food, and their size and speed invite respect. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File lists 28 unprovoked attacks (one fatal) and 13 provoked attacks by this species.ISAF Statistics on Attacking Species of Shark. International Shark Attack File, Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida. Retrieved on April 22, 2009. Blacktip sharks are responsible annually for 16% of the shark attacks around Florida. Most attacks by this species result in only minor wounds. As one of the more common large sharks in coastal waters, the blacktip shark is caught in large numbers by commercial fisheries throughout the world, using longlines, fixed- bottom nets, bottom trawls, and hook-and-line. The meat is of high quality and marketed fresh, frozen, or dried and salted. In addition, the fins are used for shark fin soup, the skin for leather, the liver oil for vitamins, and the carcasses for fishmeal. Blacktip sharks are one of the most important species to the northwestern Atlantic shark fishery, second only to the sandbar shark (C. plumbeus). The flesh is considered superior to that of the sandbar shark, resulting in the sandbar and other requiem shark species being sold under the name \\"blacktip shark\\" in the United States. The blacktip shark is also very significant to Indian and Mexican fisheries, and is caught in varying numbers by fisheries in the Mediterranean and South China Seas, and off northern Australia. The blacktip shark is popular with recreational anglers in Florida, the Caribbean, and South Africa. It is listed as a game fish by the International Game Fish Association. Once hooked, this species is a strong, steady fighter that sometimes jumps out of the water. Since 1995, the number of blacktip sharks taken by recreational anglers in the United States has approached or surpassed the number taken by commercial fishing. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the blacktip shark as Near Threatened, as its low reproductive rate renders it vulnerable to overfishing. The United States and Australia are the only two countries that manage fisheries catching blacktip sharks. In both cases, regulation occurs under umbrella management schemes for multiple shark species, such as that for the large coastal sharks category of the US National Marine Fisheries Service Atlantic shark Fisheries Management Plan. No conservation plans specifically for this species have been implemented.

By the end of November, belief in the painting's curse was widespread enough that The Sun was organising mass bonfires of the paintings, sent in by readers.Steve Punt, \\"Solved: Curse of the Crying Boy; Comic‚Äôs Obsession with Painting\\", The Sun, 9 October 2010, p.8. Steve Punt, a British writer and comedian, investigated the curse in a BBC Radio 4 production called Punt PI.Punt PI, Crying Boy episode (programme broadcast Sat 9 Oct 2010, BBC Radio 4) The conclusion reached by the programme, following testing at the Building Research Establishment, is that the prints were treated with a varnish containing fire retardant, and that the string holding the painting to the wall would be the first to deteriorate, resulting in the painting landing face down on the floor and thus being protected, although no explanation was given as to why no other paintings were turning up unscathed.

World Wars I and II further spurred its popularity. The four highest profile team sports in the United Kingdom are football, cricket, rugby union and rugby league. Basketball belongs to the next tier alongside ice hockey; it has a dedicated following, but attracts little coverage from the major British media outlets. The elite league is the fully professional British Basketball League, featuring teams from England and Scotland, while the semi-professional English Basketball League effectively forms the second-tier. There is no promotion and relegation between the two leagues because the BBL operates a franchise system whereby teams have to \\"buy into\\" the league. History =Introduced by YMCA= Basketball was first introduced in England between March 1892 and January 1893 by the president of Birkenhead YMCA, C.J. Proctor, who had observed the game during a business trip to Canada. This introduction of the game led to a growth in participation in the new game of basketball initially as an internal league played at Birkenhead YMCA members (England's first Central Venue League), and later to other YMCA clubs in the Wirral and Merseyside regions. In June 1854 Mel Rideout, a participant in the first game at Springfield College, introduced the game at a YMCA Convention held in England. This did not lead to a wider take up of the game. Birkenhead initiative remained a local development until 1911 when a YMCA instructor brought basketball to Birmingham YMCA, and a team was produced. Within a few months teams had sprung up in the district playing one another in friendly matches. The American Rules had been introduced, but the teams in Birmingham found them to be too complicated, and when forming a Local Basketball Association, they compiled a more practical set of rules for their own use. The use of YMCA instructors from Springfield College gave a direct link to the origins of the game. Within a short time after the Birmingham Development many YMCA clubs in England had adopted the game and had formed District Associations similar to the Association in Birmingham. Most of these Associations found the same difficulty of complication in the American Rules and in 1912 the Birmingham Association Rules of Basketball were accepted throughout most of England with some slight differences in rules according to particular conditions. =World War I and the inter-war years= Many Inter-Clubs and Inter-YMCA. games were played until in 1914 with the start of World War I a large number of young men left their home towns for France. Basketball naturally lost a great deal of its initial impetus and although many games were played during the War years the development was limited. With the arrival of the Americans into the War in 1917, many keen British basketball players, found out more about the game and in 1918 an American YMCA Physical Director brought some influence to hear on the District Associations in England, with the result that the local rules were altered slightly and the game became more like the American game. The game was influenced greatly by American forces in Europe during and after World War I and many European Countries as a result began to play Basketball. Britain continued to be influenced during this period, and YMCA clubs developed the game with added flavour. Rules, however, continued to vary according to the country in which the game was played and this state was to continue for a great number of years. In 1924 basketball was included as a demonstration game at the Paris Olympic Games. Great Britain was successfully represented in this Tournament by a team from the London Central YMCA who won all their games. The London Central YMCA (also written about as CentYMCA Harriers in the Dutch press) were reigning National YMCA Champions this championship having been established in 1922. One of the players from the victorious YMCA team introduced the game to the Netherlands, i.e. A.M.V.J. Amsterdam in 1929. In his honour there still is to this day a tournament called after him, the Lew Lake tournament organized by the first Dutch basketball club, AMVJ Amsterdam, founded in January 1930. Still today Lew Lake is honoured in the Dutch basketball world as the first one to give basketball demonstrations and teach the game in Holland. AMVJ organized an international basketball tournament in March 1932, the first international games in the Netherlands. Teams from Belgium, Lille, Holland and CentYMCA took part. Centymca ended second after Olympique Lille. The game continued to develop in England and in 1936 a meeting was called at the London Central YMCA to form a Governing Body for the sport. The new Association, the Amateur Basket Ball Association of England and Wales (ABBA.) was established with Mr. Herbert Naylor, the National Physical Director of YMCA in England as Chairman, Mr. J. A. Clay of Birmingham as Honorary Secretary and Mr. W. Browning as London Area Secretary. To run the Association England was divided into four areas: # Manchester and a radius of up to 100 miles # Birmingham and a radius of up to 100 miles # London (including Bournemouth) and a radius of up to 100 miles # Cardiff and a radius of up to 100 miles A Divisional Secretary was appointed in each area. The game continued to spread in England as it was doing worldwide. Prior to 1936 basketball had been included in the Far Eastern Olympics held in Japan each year. Many new faces appeared in Basketball in England. Mr. George Williams of London presented a cup to the ABBA, as Senior Championship Cup and the first tournament for the cup was staged in Birmingham on 6 June 1936. The finalists in this Knockout Championship Tournament were Hoylake YMCA and London Polytechnic. The former winning the 1st Championships of England and Wales by 32 points to 21 points. Greater interest was taken in Basketball because of the incentive of the Championships and many more teams affiliated to ABBA the following year. The standard of play also improved and on 19 March 1938, Hoylake YMCA (the 1937 winners) were opposed by Latter Day Saints. This game won by Hoylake YMCA was the first game to be broadcast on radio with a running commentary being given during the final. The George Williams Trophy played for by the teams in this competition is still used today for EB's premier Championship Competition. Hoylake YMCA in October 1937 represented England in the Tournament at a Paris Competition - the first International team to play for England. During 1937, Basketball had increased in popularity, not only with senior players, but also with the younger members. Junior games were played extensively and in 1938 ABBA organised on similar lines to the Senior Championships a National Junior Championship of England and Wales. Plaistow YMCA presented the ABBA with a Challenge Cup. On 9 April 1938 the first Junior Championship Final was held in Birmingham between Ton Pentre (Rhondda Valley) Boys' Club and London Polytechnic with the Welsh Club winning the first tournament. On the 18th, 19th, and 20 April 1938 basketball was included along with the European Roller Speed Skating Championships the Semi Finals and Finals of the Basketball Championship of England and Wales. In the Final, the Catford Saints beat Rochdale Greys 61 points to 47 points. The standard of play in this Championship showed considerable improvement. On the day following the Championship Finals Catford Saints represented England in the first International match ever held in Britain. The game against Germany was won by England by 40 points to 35 points. On 22/23 October 1938 a composite England International Team competed in the International Basketball Tournament at the Sports Palace in Berlin. The team with Mr. W. Browning as Coach and Mr. J. Clay as Manager included three Birmingham players - F. Cole, C. Hunt and A. J. Lee, four London players - F. Gibson. R. Bradley, A. Hants, M. Ashton. and also F. Allen (Rochdale) and G. McMinn (Manchester). This was the first time a composite International Team had travelled abroad and this in itself showed the development of English Basketball. Birmingham and London Area supplied the majority of those International players in keeping with the level of the development of Basketball in England. ABBA of England and Wales, had, gone all out to attract the public, with success. Basketball was now being played extensively in most areas of England and Wales and the public seemed to be interested. In February 1939 a London National League was started involving 6 teams playing in a League Competition at Haringey Arena. =World War II= English Basketball was progressing very well indeed and by including 'Catford Saints' as the English team (1939 Championship Winners) in the Liege Festival that year, the ABBA once more made England's position in European Basketball felt. It is unfortunate for the progress of Basketball that World War II started in the latter part of 1939. A Championship Final was held in April 1940 with the Birmingham Athletic Institute (BAI) beating London Central YMCA in this final. Due to the war there was no Championship for the next six years and thus Birmingham retained the Trophy for that period. The War, although stemming the development of the actual number of clubs in Britain, did have a good effect upon the game. The Army adopted the game and a number of Army teams were started. The Army influenced the other services and Inter-Service Tournaments were started. Many novices at basketball were introduced to a better class of play and coaching in the services. With the fall of the European Countries, many service personnel from these countries came to Britain, included in the Polish and French services contained some very keen basketball players, these people helped in the development of the game in the Forces. In 1942/43, with the arrival of American forces, a further impetus to the growth of the game was given and their influence on the game in Britain continued for many years after the War. Present Basketball struggles to get funding, but there are still two leagues (the British Basketball League and the English Basketball League). The latter covers divisions 2, 3, and 4.

The Chicago Tribune appreciated his keen eye for detail, and vivid splashy style. It sent him to England to cover World War I. As a correspondent at the Battle of Belleau Wood, France. Gibbons accompanied the Fifth Marines where his account of the battle that he submitted violated wartime censorship by mentioning that he was serving with the U.S. Marine Corps. Gibbons' colourful prose added to the reputation of the Marines p. 182 Lindsay, Charles On the Cover Hoover Digest Monday, July 9, 2018 2018 No. 3.

It is a sub-division of Stagecoach Merseyside and South Lancashire. It was formed in July 2005 due to the acquisition of Glenvale Transport (GT), which in turn had initially been formed by ex-MTL managers bidding for the company, following a Competition Commission ruling that Arriva must sell their newly acquired Gillmoss depot to preserve competition between bus operators within the Merseyside area. The fleet of the newly created Glenvale Transport mostly comprised elderly Leyland Titans and aging Dennis Darts, although efforts were made to update the fleet via an agreement with Essex-based dealer Ensignbus, seeing newer buses arrive regularly from the end of 2003 right up to the Stagecoach takeover in the summer of 2005. Several much newer buses, although in need of repair, were permanently stationed at the depot, likely due to financial struggles making it difficult to repair the buses. Glenvale had an annual turnover of approximately ¬£25 million.Stagecoach invests in new buses for Merseyside Stagecoach Group, 10 August 2005 The company was sold to Stagecoach Group in 2005, who pledged to invest in new buses for Merseyside. The result since takeover has been a ¬£6.5m fleet of 75 new low-floor Alexander Dennis Dart buses that have entered service with the company, with the sale and disposal of older buses previously in operation with Glenvale. Also, in late January 2013 Stagecoach purchased First Chester & The Wirral bus operations in and these now operate as part of Stagecoach Merseyside.http://www.stagecoachbus.com/chester-wirral.aspx History =Glenvale Transport= =Stagecoach Merseyside= On numerous occasions Stagecoach made bids for some or all of the companies making up the former MTL Trust Holdings. In June 1998 MTL sold off MTL London but Stagecoach were outbid by the then independent Metroline. When MTL went bankrupt in January 2000 Stagecoach were very interested in acquiring the company but was again outbid this time by Arriva. It wasn't known at the time but Stagecoach did bid for the Gillmoss depot after Arriva was ordered to dispose of it. But again it was an unsuccessful bidder losing out to Glenvale Transport (GT). Apart from a Stagecoach Ribble/North West service between Southport and Preston and a Sunday only Lancashire County Council contract from Liverpool to Preston/Blackpool it seemed unlikely that Stagecoach would ever have significant operations on Merseyside. When rumours of a sale at GT surfaced around 2005 it was FirstGroup with its nearby operations First Chester & The Wirral and First Greater Manchester - which at the time had a school bus division in nearby Kirkby, the Go-Ahead Group and Transdev who at the time were bidding for Merseytravel's cancelled Merseytram scheme who seemed like the front runners to buy GTl. However, on 13 July 2005, GT accepted a reported ¬£3.4 million cash offer offer for the company from the Stagecoach Group who in turn agreed to absorb GT's debt of approximately ¬£7 million. Rebranded Stagecoach Merseyside, Glenvale Transport Limited was retained as the company's legal name. Depot * Gillmoss (East Lancs Road, Liverpool) Fleet An Alexander Dennis Enviro300 in Queen Square bus station As of August 2015 the fleet consisted of 148 buses. =Last Leyland Titan Day= In 1992 Merseybus in an effort to modernise its fleet entered into an agreement with London Buses to purchase a significant quantity of their Leyland Titans dating from 1978 to 1984. These proved popular with other operators on Merseyside and overall approximately 400 Titans saw service in the region and by the time of the takeover of GTL by Stagecoach there were still quite healthy numbers in service. However Stagecoach quickly made the replacement of the aging fleet on Merseyside (see above) a top priority and by the beginning of 2006 only a handful remained in service. Most Merseyside bus enthusiasts took to the Titan well with some of these vehicles spending more time on Merseyside than they did in London and Stagecoach Merseyside therefore decided to hold a Last Titan Day on Saturday 4 February 2006. The last serviceable examples at Gillmoss took enthusiasts on a tour of Liverpool and the Wirral and were joined by T1, the first production Titan which was owned by Stagecoach London, a Stagecoach North West Titan and a preserved Titan which had previously been owned by Merseyline of Garston. The event also featured other vehicles including Stagecoach Chesterfield's ex-Grimsby-Cleethorpes open-top Daimler Fleetline, a Stagecoach Manchester Scania N113, which had been new to London Buses, an ex-Merseyside Transport Leyland Atlantean, once based at Gillmoss, an ex-Greater Manchester Transport Atlantean formerly based at Wigan and a regular visitor to Merseyside and an Arriva London, AEC Routemaster. =Liverpool FC Stagecoach Champions of Champions Buses= Stagecoach Merseyside 34815/PX06DVZ and Stagecoach Lancashire 16335/VLT255 at Gillmoss depot On 20 June 2007, Stagecoach Merseyside and Stagecoach North West, in partnership with World Football Exhibitions and Liverpool Football Club, launched two branded Liverpool FC Champions of Champions buses to celebrate Liverpool FC's history in European Competition. Stagecoach Merseyside 34815/PX06DVZ at Gillmoss depot The buses were launched at Anfield by Tom Wileman, Stagecoach Regional Director, and Liverpool FC legends Phil Neal, Alan Kennedy, David Fairclough, Ian Callaghan, Chris Lawler and David Johnson. Also at the ribbon cutting ceremony was the actual UEFA Champions League trophy which Liverpool FC won for a record fifth time in Istanbul in 2005. Speaking at the ribbon cutting, Liverpool legend David Fairclough said: \\"Both buses look brilliant, it's a great tribute to our European history\\". Tom Wileman of Stagecoach added, \\"Liverpool's achievements in European football have been fantastic, not only for the city but for the whole region and we wanted to recognise and celebrate that\\". The new buses feature images and facts from Liverpool FC's 5 successful European Cup victories of 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984 and 2005.

The two meanings overlap, for example, in the notion of a linear connection on the tangent bundle of a manifold. In older literature, the term linear connection is occasionally used for an Ehresmann connection or Cartan connection on an arbitrary fiber bundle, to emphasise that these connections are \\"linear in the horizontal direction\\" (i.e., the horizontal bundle is a vector subbundle of the tangent bundle of the fiber bundle), even if they are not \\"linear in the vertical (fiber) direction\\".

Animation showing how a passive electronically scanned array works. It consists of an array of antenna elements (A) powered by a single transmitter (TX). The feed current for each antenna passes through a phase shifter (œÜ) controlled by a computer (C). The moving red lines show the wavefronts of the radio waves emitted by each element. The individual wavefronts are spherical, but they combine (superpose) in front of the antenna to create a plane wave, a beam of radio waves travelling in a specific direction. The phase shifters delay the radio waves progressively going up the line so each antenna emits its wavefront later than the one below it. This causes the resulting plane wave to be directed at an angle to the antenna. The velocity of the radio waves is shown slowed down enormously. A passive electronically scanned array (PESA), also known as passive phased array, is an antenna in which the beam of radio waves can be electronically steered to point in different directions (that is, a phased array antenna), in which all the antenna elements are connected to a single transmitter (such as a magnetron, a klystron or a travelling wave tube) and/or receiver. The largest use of phased arrays is in radars. Most phased array radars in the world are PESA. The civilian microwave landing system uses PESA transmit-only arrays. A PESA contrasts with an active electronically scanned array (AESA) antenna, which has a separate transmitter and/or receiver unit for each antenna element, all controlled by a computer; AESA is a more advanced, sophisticated versatile second-generation version of the original PESA phased array technology. Radar systems generally work by connecting an antenna to a powerful radio transmitter to emit a short pulse of signal. The transmitter is then disconnected and the antenna is connected to a sensitive receiver which amplifies any echos from target objects. By measuring the time it takes for the signal to return, the radar receiver can determine the distance to the object. The receiver then sends the resulting output to a display of some sort. The transmitter elements were typically klystron tubes or magnetrons, which are suitable for amplifying or generating a narrow range of frequencies to high power levels. To scan a portion of the sky, the radar antenna must be physically moved to point in different directions. In 1959, DARPA developed an experimental phased array radar called Electronically Steered Array Radar ESAR. The first module, a linear array, was completed in 1960. It formed the basis of the AN/FPS-85.https://www.darpa.mil/about- us/timeline/phased-arrays Starting in the 1960s new solid-state devices capable of delaying the transmitter signal in a controlled way were introduced. That led to the first practical large-scale passive electronically scanned array, or simply phased array radar. PESAs took a signal from a single source, split it into hundreds of paths, selectively delayed some of them, and sent them to individual antennas. The radio signals from the separate antennas overlapped in space, and the interference patterns between the individual signals was controlled to reinforce the signal in certain directions, and mute it in all others. The delays could be easily controlled electronically, allowing the beam to be steered very quickly without moving the antenna. A PESA can scan a volume of space much quicker than a traditional mechanical system. Thanks to progress in electronics, PESAs added the ability to produce several active beams, allowing them to continue scanning the sky while at the same time focusing smaller beams on certain targets for tracking or guiding semi-active radar homing missiles. PESAs quickly became widespread on ships and large fixed emplacements in the 1960s, followed by airborne sensors as the electronics shrank.

Section 114 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 defines hearsay evidence as a statement not made in oral evidence in criminal proceedings and admissible as evidence of any matter stated but only if certain conditions are met, specifically where: * It is in the interests of justice to admit it (see section 114(1)(d)) * The witness cannot attend (see section 116) * The evidence is in a document (see section 117) * The evidence is multiple hearsay (see section 121) The meaning of \\"statements\\" and \\"matter stated\\" is explained in section 115 of the 2003 Act. \\"Oral evidence\\" is defined in section 134(1) of that Act. History of the rule The rules of hearsay began to form properly in the late seventeenth century and had become fully established by the early nineteenth century. The issues were analysed in substantial detail in Wright v Doe d Tatham.(1837) 7 Ad & El 313 The technical nature of the discussion in Doe d Tatham inhibited much reasoned progress of the law, whose progress (in the form of judicial capacity to reform it) ended not long afterwards.Sugden v Lord St Leonards (1876) 1 PD 154; see also Sturla v Freccia, below Later attempts to reform through the common law it got little further, with Lord Reid in Myers v DPP[1965] AC 1001 at 1021 saying There was some statutory reform in the nineteenth century (see Bankers' Books Evidence Act 1879), and later the Evidence Act 1938 made some further if cautious reforms. The state of the hearsay rules were regarded as 'absurd' by Lord Reid and Lord Diplock.Jones v Metcalfe [1967] 1 WLR 1286 at 1291 The Law Commission13th Report of the Law Reform Committee Cmnd 2964 (1966), para 11 and Supreme Court committeeReport of the Committee on Supreme Court practice and procedure, Cmnd 8878 (1953) provided a number of reports on hearsay reform, prior to the Civil Evidence Acts 1968 and 1972. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 (\\"2003 Act\\"), which went into force on 4 April 2005, introduced significant reforms to the hearsay rule, implementing (with modifications) the report by the Law Commission in Evidence in Criminal Proceedings: Hearsay and Related Topics (LC245), published on 19 June 1997. Previously, the Criminal Justice Act 1988 carved out exceptions to the hearsay rule for unavailable witnesses and business documents. These were consolidated into the 2003 Act. Reasoning behind the rule The reasoning behind the hearsay rule can be seen by comparing the acceptance of direct evidence and hearsay. Direct evidence is given under oath (with potential criminal liability for perjury if the testimony is subsequently proven false), in the presence of the court and jury, and may be cross-examined. In adducing direct evidence (that is, recollection of a witness in court) the court considers how the witness would have perceived the event at the time, potential ambiguities, and the witness's sincerity. These can be tested in cross-examination. A statement reported in hearsay is not generally subject to these safeguards. The person making the original statement was not testifying under oath, and was not subject to cross-examination. Even assuming that the witness reporting the original statement does so completely truthfully, it remains possible that the person making the original statement was lying, joking, or exaggerating. It is also possible that the witness testifying at trial misunderstood the original statement. The court has no way to assess these possibilities, except via the testimony of the witness reporting the hearsay. Although the hearsay rule is directed only at references to statements asserted for the truth of their contents, the courts were alive to the dangers of circumstantial as well as direct evidence:Thayer, Legal Essays, 1907 The nature of the genuine danger of allowing a jury to make an inappropriate inference about the nature of such evidence has led to misunderstandings about the nature of hearsay.R v Olisa [1990] Crim LR 721 A different rationale can be found in the requirement of justice that the accused is entitled to face his or her opponents. This principle finds support in the European Convention on Human Rights (articles 6(1) and 6(3)(d)) and, in the United States the sixth amendment of its Constitution (its principles tracing back to Raleigh's Trial2 St Tr 15). Civil proceedings Hearsay is generally admissible in civil proceedings.Civil Evidence Act 1995, . This is one area in which English law differs dramatically from American law; under the Federal Rules of Evidence, used in U.S. federal courts and followed practically verbatim in almost all states, hearsay is inadmissible in both criminal and civil trials barring a recognised exception. The law concerning hearsay in civil proceedings was reformed substantially by the Civil Evidence Act 19951995 c. 38 (\\"the 1995 Act\\") and is now primarily upon a statutory footing. The Act arose from a report of the Law Commission published in 1993The Hearsay Rule in Civil proceedings (LC216), Cm 2321 (1993) - see Hearsay Rules in Civil Proceedings, Law Commission which criticised the previous reforming statutes' excessive caution and cumbersome procedures. Section 1 of the Act says This includes hearsay of multiple degree (that is, hearsay evidence of hearsay evidence: for example \\"Jack told me that Jill told him that she went up the hill\\"). Other provisions of the 1995 Act preserve common law rules relating to public documents, published works of a public nature and public records.Civil Evidence Act 1995, s.7(2) The common law in respect of good and bad character, reputation or family tradition is also preserved.ibid s.7(3) The Act moves some of the focus of hearsay evidence to weight, rather than admissibility, setting out considerations in assessing the evidence (set out in summary form):Civil Evidence Act 1995, s.4(2) * Reasonableness of the party calling the evidence to have produced the original maker * Whether the original statement was made at or near the same time as the evidence it mentions * Whether the evidence involves multiple hearsay * Whether any person involved had any motive to conceal or misrepresent matters * Whether the original statement was an edited account, or was made in collaboration with another, or for a particular purpose * Whether the circumstances of the hearsay evidence suggest an attempt to prevent proper evaluation of its weight Criminal proceedings =Statutory definition= The Criminal Justice Act 2003 defines hearsay as statements \\"not made in oral evidence in the proceedings\\" being used \\"as evidence of any matter stated\\".Criminal Justice Act 2003, . =General rule= The general rule clearly states that an hearsay will not be used in court proceedings as it is not generally admissible. =Statutory exceptions= Unavailable witnesses A witness's testimony may be read in court if the witness is unavailable to attend.Criminal Justice Act 2003, s.116, formerly in the Criminal Justice Act 1988, s.23 To be admissible, the evidence must be otherwise admissible, and the maker of the statement identified to the court's satisfaction. Additionally, the absent person making the original statement must fall within one of five categories--they are: Unfit to be a witness because of bodily or mental condition Outside the United Kingdom and it is not reasonably practicable to secure their attendance * Cannot be found, and reasonably practicable steps to find them have been taken * Afraid to testify or continue to testify In the case of absence through fear, additional safeguards are imposed prior to the statement's admission. The court must be satisfied it is in the interests of justice, particularly considering the statements contents, whether special measures (screens in court, or video live-link) would assist, and any unfairness to the defendant in not being able to challenge the evidence. A party to the proceedings (that is, either the prosecution or defence) who causes any of the above five conditions to occur to stop a witness giving evidence, cannot then adduce the hearsay evidence of it. The scope of this rule has been considered in cases when much of the prosecution case involves evidence by a witness who is absent from court. In Luca v Italy (2003),(2003) 26 E.H.R.R. 46, European Court of Human Rights in the European Court of Human Rights, it was held that a conviction solely or decisively based upon evidence of witnesses which the accused has had no opportunity to examine breached Article 6 of the Convention (right to a fair trial). However in R v Arnold (2004),[2004] 6 Archbold News 2, Court of Appeal in the Court of Appeal, it was said this rule would permit of some exceptions, otherwise it would provide a licence to intimidate witnesses - though neither should it be treated as a licence for prosecutors to prevent testing of their case. Each application had to be weighed carefully. Business documents Documents created in the course of a trade, occupation, profession or public office (referred to as \\"business\\") can be used as evidence of the facts stated therein.Criminal Justice Act 2003, s.117, formerly in the Criminal Justice Act 1988, s.24 To be admissible, the evidence referred to in the document must itself be admissible. The person supplying the information must have had personal knowledge of it (or be reasonably supposed to have had), and everyone else through whom the information was supplied must have also been acting in the course of business. If the business information was produced in the course of a domestic criminal investigation, then either one of the above five categories (for absent witnesses) must apply, or the person producing the statement cannot be expected now to have any recollection of the original information. A typical example of this is doctor's notes in relation to an injured person, which is then adduced as medical evidence in a criminal trial. Previous criminal records can be adduced (if otherwise admissible) under this section, but not normally any further details about the method of commission, unless it can be demonstrated that the data inputter had the appropriate personal knowledge.R v Humphris, 169 J.P. 441, Court of Appeal Previous consistent and inconsistent statements Sometimes during the testimony of a witness, the witness may be questioned about statements he previously made outside court on an earlier occasion, to demonstrate either that he has been consistent or inconsistent in his account of events. The Act did not change the circumstances in which such statements could become admissible in evidence (which are still prescribed in the Criminal Procedure Act 1865), but it did change the evidential effect of such statements once admitted. Formerly, such statements were not evidence of the facts stated in them (unless the witness agreed with them in court): they only proved that the witness had kept his story straight or had changed his story, and so were only evidence of his credibility (or lack of it) as a witness. They were not hearsay. Under the 2003 Act, however, such statements are now themselves evidence of any facts stated in them, not just of credibility, and so are now hearsay. =Preserved common law exceptions= Section 118 of the 2003 Act preserved the following common law rules and abolished the remainder: * Public information as evidence of the facts stated therein: ** published works dealing with matters of a public nature (such as histories, scientific works, dictionaries and maps) ** public documents (such as public registers, and returns made under public authority with respect to matters of public interest) ** records (such as the records of certain courts, treaties, Crown grants, pardons and commissions) ** evidence relating to a person's age or date or place of birth may be given by a person without personal knowledge of the matter * Reputation as to character - evidence of a person's reputation is admissible for the purpose of proving his good or bad character * Reputation or family tradition - evidence of reputation or family tradition is admissible to prove or disprove (and only so far as it does so): ** pedigree or the existence of a marriage (or civil partnership following the Civil Partnership Act 2004) ** the existence of any public or general right ** the identity of any person or thing * Res gestae - statements are admissible if: ** the statement was made by a person so emotionally overpowered by an event that the possibility of concoction or distortion can be disregarded, ** the statement accompanied an act which can be properly evaluated as evidence only if considered in conjunction with the statement, or ** the statement relates to a physical sensation or a mental state (such as intention or emotion). * Confessions - all rules relating to the admissibility of confessions or mixed statements * Admissions by agents etc. as evidence of facts stated: ** an admission made by an agent of a defendant is admissible against the defendant as evidence of any matter stated, or ** a statement made by a person to whom a defendant refers a person for information is admissible against the defendant as evidence of any matter stated. * Common enterprise - a statement made by a party to a common enterprise is admissible against another party to the enterprise * Expert evidence Agreement Hearsay evidence is permitted by agreement between all parties in the proceedings.Criminal Justice Act 2003, s.114(1)c) No such provision existed before the coming into force of the 2003 Act. Interests of justice There are some older cases which threw the rigidities of the hearsay rule into sharp relief. In Sparks v R an American airman was accused of indecently assaulting a girl just under the age of four. Evidence that the four-year-old victim (who did not give evidence herself) had told her mother \\"it was a coloured boy\\" was held not to be admissible (not being res gestae either) against the defendant, who was white. In R v Blastland[1986] AC 41 (1986) the House of Lords held in a murder case that highly self-incriminating remarks made by a third party, not at the trial, could not be admitted in evidence (the remarks mentioning the murder of a boy whose body had not yet been independently discovered). Under the 2003 Act, any hearsay evidence whether or not covered by another provision may be admitted by the court if it is \\"in the interests of justice\\" to do so.Criminal Justice Act 2003, s.114(1)(d) This provision is sometimes known as the \\"safety valve\\". The Act sets out criteria in determining whether the interests of justice test are met, and provides for consideration of other relevant factors:Criminal Justice Act 2003, s.114(2) * How much probative value (that is, use in determining the case) the statement has (assuming it to be true), or its value in understanding other evidence; * What other relevant evidence has been or can be given; * Its importance in the context of the case as a whole; * Circumstances in which the statement was made; * How reliable the maker of the statement appears to be; * How reliable the evidence in the statement appears to be; * Whether oral evidence can be given and, if not, why not; * The difficulty involved in challenging the statement; * The extent to which that difficulty would prejudice the party facing it.

Graduate of the Baltimore City College and the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, musician in a nickelodeon, and chorus boy in one of the Milton Aborn's operettas, Goodman was first introduced to musical comedy by the late Earl Carroll, who persuaded him to collaborate in producing his musical, So Long Letty. The success, followed by the hit \\"Sinbad,\\" which he produced with Al Jolson, led to positions as orchestra conductor for many Broadway productions including the highly successful Flyin‚Äô High, The Student Prince, and Blossom Time. In all, during this period of his career, Goodman directed over 150 first-night performances and became one of the Great White Way's most popular conductors. He was in such demand that it was not uncommon for him to conduct the orchestra of a show for the first few performances, and then hand the baton over to another while he prepared for a new production. In addition to his many assignments as one of RCA Victor's most talented conductors and arrangers, Goodman was kept busy directing the music for various radio network shows including The Ziegfeld Follies of the Air (1932), Palmolive Beauty Box Theater (1935-1937), Your Hit Parade (1935-1938), The Fred Allen Show (1945-1949), and his pet program, The Prudential Family. During television's early years, Al Goodman was tapped to supervise and conduct the music for NBC's variety showcase Colgate Comedy Hour programs done from New York City. Goodman wrote some memorable songs such as \\"When Hearts Are Young\\", \\"Call of Love\\" and \\"Twilight\\".

One of eight brothers and sisters, he was an older brother to jockey Sam Maple who won more than 2,500 races. He began riding horses at age 12 and won his first race as a professional at 17. He went on to be one of the top jockeys in the United States and a National Hall of Fame inductee. He won his first race at Ascot Park in Akron. He spent his early career in Ohio and West Virginia, and moved to tracks in New Jersey in 1970, but then later relocated to New York in 1971. Maple was the jockey for Hall of Famer Riva Ridge in the 1973 Marlboro Cup, getting the ride when regular jockey Ron Turcotte rode Secretariat to victory in the same race. His strong 2nd-place performance earned him the opportunity of a lifetime later that year when Turcotte was suspended from riding for five days, and Eddie Maple rode Secretariat to victory in his last race, the Canadian International Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack. In 1982 he scored his second win in the Canadian International with Majesty's Prince. In 1980, Eddie Maple won the Belmont Stakes aboard Temperence Hill and again in 1985 on Creme Fraiche. He competed in nine Kentucky Derbys, his best finish a second in 1982 behind winner Gato Del Sol. Among his other major victories, Eddie Maple won the Travers Stakes three times, the Kentucky Oaks, the Arlington Million, and the 1991 Italian 1,000 Guineas (Premio Regina Elena) in Rome, Italy. In 1995, Eddie Maple was voted the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award, and in 1998, the Mike Venezia Memorial Award. He retired in 1998 with 4,398 wins.

As of 2009, Zepter lives in the Villa Trianon in Cap Martin.Hello! Magazine, No. 1074, 2 June 2009, pg. 6‚Äì16 Early years and education He completed primary school in Kozarska Dubica before graduating from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Economics. At the age of 29, he went to Salzburg, Austria, following his wife Madlena Zepter (then Madlena Jankoviƒá) who got a temporary job there and to study German, and liked it so much there that he decided to stay. After he moved to Linz, in 1986 he founded Zepter Handels-GmbH, a multi- level marketing firm for pots and pans, which has over time grown into the conglomerate Zepter International which provides \\"a wide range of products and services, including banking, insurance, telecommunications, and retail sales of consumer products.\\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-dc-circuit/1505826.html Political involvement Zepter was an early, important and continuous supporter of democratic reforms in Serbia and of the leading Serbian politicians who worked for that reform, one of whom was Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá. Zepter continued his active support for ƒêinƒëiƒá' pro-reform, democratic agenda, once saying that ƒêinƒëiƒá was \\"a glimpse of bright light in the general hopelessness.\\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS- dcd-1_04-cv-01198/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_04-cv-01198-2.pdf. =International Crisis Group accusation= During the early 2000s, Zepter was attacked and defamed by the U.S. \\"think tank\\" International Crisis Group, which Zepter sued for libel in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. In a unanimous, 29 January 2010 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals decided that International Crisis Group falsely stated (seeking an excuse for its false and unfounded claim that Zepter had supported Milo≈°eviƒá) that a bank controlled by Zepter was listed on a frozen assets list put out by the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control because \\"International Crisis Group\\" failed to disclose that any and all financial companies in Serbia were put on that list, regardless of who they were or who they supported.https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/FF616B95F795A1BC852578070059E2CE/$file/09-7044-1228215.pdf. International Crisis Group's report was written by James Lyon about whom that Court said: \\"The only evidence shows that Lyon's motive to extort was consistent with blackmailing individuals with reports he believed to be true\\" and that the \\"evidence of Lyon's attempted extortion shows poor judgment and is hardly admirable conduct for a reporter.\\"https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/8202574B92DA3D2D85257FAF004DF8E9/$file/14-7171-1612396.pdf. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia also determined and confirmed that Zepter had been a \\"close personal friend\\" of ƒêinƒëiƒá, and, when requested by ƒêinƒëiƒá, had helped the Serbian reform government pay for and arrange the services of a U.S. political consultant who, in turn, arranged for ƒêinƒëiƒá and other Serbian officials to meet with the President of the United States, the U.S. Secretary of State and several other American officials, to help establish better relations between the United States and the ƒêinƒëiƒá' government administration. That remarkable meeting resulted in ƒêinƒëiƒá announcing that the United States agreed to write off two thirds of then-Yugoslavia's $12.2 billion debt and to reschedule the remainder. That U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia held that Mr. Zepter declared his support for ƒêinƒëiƒá numerous times, including in a 2001 open letter to the Serbian people in which Zepter stated that \\"for a number of years, on a daily basis I have lobbied for prosperity and well-being of my country and my people.\\" The U.S. Court of Appeals also confirmed that for many years Zepter was an \\"outspoken supporter\\" and \\"financial backer\\" of pro- democratic Serbian Prime Minister Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá. That Court of Appeals also decided that because of Zepter's extensive personal efforts to support and work for democratic reform in Serbia by, in that U.S. Court's words, \\"acting as an advisor and financier of the Serbian reform effort.\\" Zepter became a limited public figure which then diminished his ability to continue his lawsuit for libel. Awards In 2011 he has been awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor.

The mouthparts of arthropods have evolved into a number of forms, each adapted to a different style or mode of feeding. Most mouthparts represent modified, paired appendages, which in ancestral forms would have appeared more like legs than mouthparts. In general, arthropods have mouthparts for cutting, chewing, piercing, sucking, shredding, siphoning, and filtering. This article outlines the basic elements of four arthropod groups: insects, myriapods, crustaceans and chelicerates. Insects are used as the model, with the novel mouthparts of the other groups introduced in turn. Insects are not, however, the ancestral form of the other arthropods discussed here. Insects Insect mouthparts exhibit a range of forms. The earliest insects had chewing mouthparts. Specialisation includes mouthparts modified for siphoning, piercing, sucking and sponging. These modifications have evolved a number of times. For example, mosquitoes (which are flies) and aphids (which are bugs) both pierce and suck; however, female mosquitoes feed on animal blood whereas aphids feed on plant fluids. This section provides an overview of the individual mouthparts of chewing insects. 220pxthumbFigure 1: Chewing mouthparts of a grasshopper. Legend: lr, labrum; md, mandibles; mx, maxillae; hp hypopharynx; lb, labium. =Labrum= The labrum is a flat extension of the head (below the clypeus), covering the mandibles. Unlike other mouthparts, the labrum is a single, fused plate (though it originally was‚Äîand embryonically is‚Äîtwo structures). It is the upper-most of the mouthparts and located on the midline. It serves to hold food in place during chewing by the mandibles and thus can simply be described as an upper lip. =Mandible= Chewing insects have two mandibles, one on each side of the head. They are typically the largest mouthpart of chewing insects, being used to masticate (cut, shred, tear, crush, chew) food items. They open outwards (to the sides of the head) and come together medially. =Maxilla= Paired maxillae cut food and manipulate it during mastication. Maxillae can have hairs and \\"teeth\\" along their inner margins. At the outer margin, the galea is a cupped or scoop-like structure, which sits over the outer edge of the labium. They also have palps, which are used to sense the characteristics of potential foods. =Labium= The labium is a single structure, although it is formed from two fused secondary maxillae. It can be described as the floor of the mouth and functioning in close the mouth of the insect. With the maxillae, it assists manipulation of food during mastication. =Hypopharynx= The hypopharynx is a somewhat globular structure, arising from the base of the labium. It assists swallowing. It performs the role of the tongue found in large vertebrates. Myriapods Figure 2: Ventral view of forcipules of a centipede, arising from the first body segment Myriapods comprise four classes of arthropod, each with a similar morphology: Class Chilopoda (centipedes); class Diplopoda (millipedes); class Pauropoda; and class Symphyla. Myriapod mouthparts are similar to those of chewing insects, although there is some variation between the myriapod classes. A labrum is present but sometimes is not obvious and forms an upper lip, often in association with an epistome. The labium is formed by first maxillae in diplopoda forming the gnathochilarium. The preoral cavity so-formed contains paired mandibles and any maxillae which are present. =Forcipules= Centipedes, in addition to their mouthparts, possess a pair of \\"poison claws\\", or forcipules. These, like the maxillipeds of crustaceans, are modified legs and not true mouthparts. The forcipules arise from the first body segment, curving forward and to the midline. The tip is a pointed fang, which has an opening from a venom gland. The forcipules are used to capture and envenomate prey. Crustaceans Crustaceans comprise a number of classes, with various feeding modes supported by a range of adaptions to the mouthparts. In general, however, crustaceans possess paired mandibles with opposing biting and grinding surfaces. The mandibles are followed by paired first and second maxillae. Both the mandibles and the maxillae have been variously modified in different crustacean groups for filter feeding with the use of setae. Figure 3: The mouthparts of an edible crab: the third maxillipeds conceal the remaining mouthparts =Maxillipeds= Up to the first three pairs of legs are modified to maxillipeds, which assist manipulation of food items by passing food forward to the mandibles for chewing or to the maxillae for cutting into smaller pieces. =Setae= Filter feeding crustaceans have setae on modified appendages that act as filters. Filter feeding may have developed in association with swimming, with early morphological adaptions occurring on the appendages of the body trunk. Subsequent adaptions appear to have favored forward filtering appendages. Filtering appendages generate water currents that bring food items into reach for collection by setae. Other setae may be used to brush the filtering setae clean, and yet other setae may transport food items to the mouth. =Cirri= Barnacles have thoracic appendages modified for feeding, the cirri, which filter suspended food particles from water currents and pass the food to the mouth. Chelicerates Chelicerates comprise four classes of arthropod, with similar gross morphology but defining differences: Class Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs); class Eurypterida (the extinct eurypterids); class Arachnida (spiders, scorpions, ticks and mites); and class Pycnogonida (sea spiders). Chelicerates are in part defined by possessing chelicerate appendages, although crustaceans also possess chelate appendages. Chelicerates are more easily distinguished from other arthropods in lacking antennae and mandibles. Figure 4: Types of chelicerae: (A) jackknife, (B) scissor, and (C) 3-segmented chelate =Chelicerae= Chelicerae are chelate appendages that are used to grasp food. For example, in horseshoe crabs, they are like pincers, whereas in spiders, they are hollow and contain (or are connected to) venom glands and are used to inject venom to disable prey prior to feeding. In some spiders, the chelicerae have teeth, which are used to macerate prey items to assist digestion by secreted enzymes. Those spiders without toothed chelicerae inject digestive enzymes directly into their prey. Mites and ticks have a range of chelicerae. Carnivores have chelicerae that tear and crush prey, whereas herbivores can have chelicerae that are modified for piercing and sucking (as do parasitic species). In sea spiders, the chelicerae (also known as chelifores) are short and chelate and are positioned on either side of the base of the proboscis or sometimes vestigial or absent. =Proboscis= Sea spiders possess a tubular proboscis forward from the body trunk, at the end of which is the opening to the mouth. In those species that lack chelifores and palps, the proboscis is well developed and more mobile and flexible. In such cases, it can be equipped with sensory bristles and strong rasping ridges around the mouth.

The vast majority of the world's airports are non- towered. In the United States there are close to 20,000 non-towered airports compared to approximately 500 airports with control towers. Airports with a control tower without 24/7 ATC service follow non-towered airport procedures when the tower is closed but the airport remains open, for example at night.  Operations  At non-towered airports, instead of receiving instructions from an air traffic controller, aircraft pilots follow recommended operations, and communications procedures for operating at an airport without a control tower. The exact procedures vary from country to country, but they may include standard arrival and departure procedures, as well as a common communications phraseology by radio transmissions over a common frequency. For example a common traffic advisory frequency is recommended for radio communication and are used in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Non-towered airports may lie inside or underneath controlled airspace. In that case, some or all aircraft arriving and departing require clearances from a remote air traffic control unit, such as terminal or center control, even though there is no control tower managing landings and takeoffs. Pilots may be able to obtain those clearances by radio, by phone, or through a company dispatcher or local flight service station; in some cases, departing aircraft (IFR or VFR) take off and level out below the floor of controlled airspace, then radio for a clearance before climbing further. Some countries establish low-altitude VFR corridors for non-towered airports in large urban areas so that VFR arrivals and departures can avoid controlled airspace altogether. Standard US airport traffic pattern. Fig. 4-3-2 from FAA AIM. = MTAF = Some countries, such as Canada and Norway, use mandatory frequency airports (MF) or mandatory traffic advisory airports (MTAF), which operate like towered airports in some ways: the radio operators (typically a flight service station) still issue only advisories, but aircraft are required to make radio contact with the ground station before operating in the airport's control zone. = UNICOM = Many non-towered airports have radio to ground operations such as UNICOM to assist aircraft arriving, departing, or maneuvering on the ground. These radio operators such as from fixed-base operators have no authority to give aircraft clearances or instructions, but they can issue advisories to let them know about weather conditions, runway conditions, traffic, and other concerns. = Temporary towers = A mobile airport traffic control tower (MATCT) is a temporary tower in an area with an immediate increase in air traffic density. This may be due to wildfire suppression operations carrying out aerial firefighting. For special events such as fly-ins, temporary towers may operate for only several days each year at fields that are otherwise non-towered. Temporary towers may operate out of an existing airport building, an RV, or even simply a chair (with a portable transmitter and binoculars).  Criteria  When the traffic volume at an airport gets too high for safe and efficient operations, or when the mix of aircraft types and speeds becomes too large, an airport may be considered for a tower. However, it is also necessary to find the money to construct a building and pay the controllers' salaries; in some cases aviation regulations or local opposition may prevent establishment of the unit.  Risk  Hazards are created by failure to use radios to report positions and intentions when operating within the airspace, which can lead to collisions between aircraft unaware of each other. In 1996, an incoming United Express Flight 5925 collided with a King Air aircraft, which failed to report its intent to take off on a common traffic advisory frequency at non-towered Quincy Airport in Illinois. Some pilots fail to use the correct runway at non- towered airports.

He is leader of the conservative Federalist Union Party. Biography =Early life= Patti was born in rural Baigorrita, Buenos Aires Province, and as a child worked in a bakery. He entered the Buenos Aires Provincial Police Academy at 16 years old and was first stationed to the northern suburbs of Buenos Aires around Pilar and Bel√©n de Escobar. Accusations against him date back to his early years in the force, a period of political instability and tough police action against guerillas, dissidents and other activities. He was accused in a local newspaper in 1973 of killing three youths wrongly believed to have committed a crime. Patti was tried for the torture of a prisoner in 1976, but the trial was suspended and not resumed before the time limit. In 1983 he faced two further trials, including for the kidnapping and murder of Osvaldo Cambiasso and Eduardo Pereyra Rossi. La C√°mara de Diputados impidi√≥ la asunci√≥n de Luis Patti, R√≠o Negro, May 24, 2006 Again both trials were suspended. He rose through the ranks to become a police inspector and commisar and was decorated. In 1990 he faced accusations of torturing two alleged thieves with an electric prod.Biography of Luis Abelardo Patti on Desaparecidos NGO website In 1991 Patti was appointed by President Carlos Menem to lead the high-profile investigation into the murder of a young woman, Mar√≠a Soledad Morales, in Catamarca Province. He concluded it was a crime of passion, amid further allegations of the use of torture with suspects, but some years later the son of a politician with influential friends was convicted of the murder after a separate investigation. =Political career= In 1993, Patti left the police and joined the Justicialist Party. He wrote a column in the La Prensa newspaper and was appointed Intervenor of the Central Market by the government. Despite the accusations against him and graffiti around the area, Patti was elected Mayor of Escobar in 1995 with 73% of the vote. Patti launched a new party in 1999, Unidad Bonaerense, now called Partido Unidad Federalista (PA.U.FE). He was re-elected in Escobar that year and stood to be Governor of Buenos Aires Province. Patti obtained second place, but was defeated by Felipe Sol√° of the Justicialist Party by a 40% margin. He ran for a seat in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies in 2005 on the same Federal Peronist ticket as Hilda Gonz√°lez de Duhalde, candidate for the Senate, and was elected. However he was prevented from taking his seat because of the allegations against him, following a vote of the existing deputies. His replacement Dante Cama√±o, formerly a supporter of Duhalde's faction (opposed to president Kirchner), switched to the presidential faction of Peronism (the Front for Victory).Human rights vs. democracy , editorial from the Buenos Aires Herald In 2008, while Patti's actions during the 1970s were still under formal investigation, the Supreme Court of Argentina ruled against the decision of the Chamber of Deputies, saying that he should be allowed to take his seat in Congress. This caused controversy with the Cabinet Chief Alberto Fern√°ndez saying that there was a \\"conflict of powers\\" between the legislative and the judicial branches of government. Patti was ultimately convicted on April 14, 2010, for murder and sentenced to life imprisonment to be served in a regular prison facility; he admitted having a role in torture, albeit justifying his acts. Legislators from ARI, with government support, attempted to change Argentine law to prevent those accused of involvement from torture from taking public positions, a move which is highly accepted. =The Gerez incident= On the night of December 27, 2006, Luis Gerez, a Peronist workers' activist who had testified before Congress that Patti was in charge of torture sessions he endured in 1972, was supposedly kidnapped, and re-appeared two days later, immediately after a televised presidential speech on the subject, and purportedly bearing signs of forced restraint and torture (which were in no way evident during his press conference, nor later). Public prosecutors were unable to find proof to support the hypothesis of a genuine abduction (telephone hearings implemented to track possible calls from the kidnappers indicated that Gerez himself, his concubine and political comrades maybe responsible), and consequently they have followed the theory of self- kidnapping. A medical examination of Gerez confirmed that he had been subjected to torture. Gerez, who was recently given an office in the Buenos Aires Province Legislature, has recognized that it's possible to cast doubt on his abduction. ‚ÄúThirty years where necessary to acknowledge that there was genocide in Argentina. People will need time to understand my abduction‚Äù, he said. Gerez had received threats since his testimony on April 20. His disappearance was interpreted by the government as a message from groups who resent the re-opening of cases against Dirty War criminals, following the disappearance of Jorge Julio L√≥pez, a witness of the Miguel Etchecolatz trial who is missing since September 2006. Two others who testified in Congress against Patti, Orlando Ubiedo and Hugo Esteban Jaime, had received threats during November and December 2006.Manhunt launched for second missing witness , Buenos Aires Herald El testigo Gerez apareci√≥ vivo y con huellas de tortura, La Naci√≥n, December 30, 2006 Hallaron con vida al militante desaparecido en Escobar, Clar√≠n, December 30, 2006Gerez apareci√≥ tras 48 horas de secuestro, P√°gina/12, December 30, 2006 'Dirty War' witness safe and well, BBC, December 30, 2006 Patti himself denied any involvement in the threats and the kidnapping of Gerez, and claimed not to remember if Gerez had been arrested under his custody because \\"it was 30 years ago\\".

It has been described as a \\"Welsh Atlantis\\" and has featured in folklore, literature, and song. The myth Cantre'r Gwaelod was an area of land which, according to legend, was located in an area west of present-day Wales which is now under the waters of Cardigan Bay. Accounts variously suggest the tract of land extended from Bardsey Island to Cardigan or as far south as Ramsey Island. Legends of the land suggest that it may have extended 20 miles west of the present coast. Rachel Bromwich questions this identification, saying that \\"There is no certainty, however, that in twelfth century tradition Maes Gwyddneu did represent the submerged land in Cardigan Bay.\\" She also links Gwyddno Garanhir with the Hen Ogledd, not Wales. There are several versions of the myth. The earliest known form of the legend is usually said to appear in the Black Book of Carmarthen, in which the land is referred to as Maes Gwyddno (). In this version, the land was lost to floods when a well-maiden named Mererid neglected her duties and allowed the well to overflow. The popular version known today is thought to have been formed from the 17th century onwards. Cantre'r Gwaelod is described as a low-lying land fortified against the sea by a dyke, Sarn Badrig (\\"Saint Patrick's causeway\\"), with a series of sluice gates that were opened at low tide to drain the land. Cantre'r Gwaelod's capital was Caer Wyddno, seat of the ruler Gwyddno Garanhir. Two princes of the realm held charge over the dyke. One of these princes, called Seithenyn, is described in one version as a notorious drunkard and carouser, and it was through his negligence that the sea swept through the open floodgates, ruining the land. The church bells of Cantre'r Gwaelod are said to ring out in times of danger. =Relationship to myth of Llys Helig= Rachel Bromwich discusses a similar tale, that of the submergence of the kingdom of Helig ap Glanawg in the Conwy estuary. As with Cantre'r Gwaelod, there are tales of remains being seen of the sunken kingdom (Llys Helig). Bromwich believes that the two stories influenced each other, and that \\"The widespread parallels to this inundation theme would suggest that the two stories are in fact one in origin, and were localized separately in Cardiganshire and in the Conway estuary, around two traditional figures of the sixth century. She also notes that the Halliwell Manuscript gives Helig the title \\"Lord of Cantre'r Gwaelod\\". In the book New Directions In Celtic Studies Antone Minard wrote that \\"The Welsh legends of Cantre'r Gwaelod and Llys Helig (Helig's Court) contain the same details of audible bells beneath the waves and ruins which are visible at the equinoctial tides, which are the anchors of credulity in the story\\". Physical evidence Cardigan Bay, supposed location of Cantre'r Gwaelod There is no reliable physical evidence of the substantial community that legend promises lies under the sea, although several reports exist of remains being sighted. In 1770, Welsh antiquarian scholar William Owen Pughe reported seeing sunken human habitations about four miles (6.4 km) off the Ceredigion coast, between the rivers Ystwyth and Teifi. In the 1846 edition of The Topographical Dictionary of Wales, Samuel Lewis described a feature of stone walls and causeways beneath the shallow waters of Cardigan Bay: Lewis takes the view that maps by the cartographer Ptolemy marked the coastline of Cardigan Bay in the same location as it appears in modern times, suggesting that the date of the flood occurred before the second century AD. The \\"causeways\\" described by Lewis can be seen today at beaches around Cardigan Bay. Known as sarnau, these ridges stretch several miles into the sea at right angles to the coast, and are located between each of the four river mouths in the north of Cardigan Bay. Modern geologists surmise that these formations of clay, gravel and rocks are moraines formed by the action of melting glaciers end of the last ice age. In a 2006 episode of the BBC television documentary Coast, presenter Neil Oliver visited Sarn Gynfelyn at Wallog. The programme also featured the remains of the submerged forest at Ynyslas, near Borth which is associated with the lost land of Cantre'r Gwaelod. The vista of dead oak, pine, birch, willow and hazel tree stumps preserved by the acid anaerobic conditions in the soil is revealed at low tide; storms in 2010 and 2014, and particularly Storm Hannah in 2019, have eroded the sea-bed offshore and caused more stumps to be visible. The former forest is estimated to have been inundated between 4000 and 5000 years ago. Evidence of human habitation include a timber walkway made of coppiced branches and upright posts, human footprints preserved in hardened peat and burnt stones thought to be from hearths. =Images= File:Badgernet BorthBeach1.JPGSubmerged forest remains, March 2008 File:Badgernet BorthBeach2.JPGSubmerged forest remains, details, March 2008 File:Petrified tree stump at Ynyslas, Ceredigion, Wales.jpgPetrified tree stump on Borth sands near Ynyslas File:Low tide at Sarn Gynfelyn - geograph.org.uk - 845252.jpgSarn Gynfelyn revealed by low tide File:The end of Sarn Gynfelyn - geograph.org.uk - 845257.jpgThe end of Sarn Gynfelyn Origins of the myth alt=Satellite view of the Celtic Sea The myth, like so many others, may be a folk memory of gradually rising sea levels at the end of the ice age. The physical remains of the preserved sunken forest at Borth, and of Sarn Badrig nearby, could have suggested that some great tragedy had overcome a community there long ago and so the myth may have grown from that. =Analogies in other legends= The legend of Cantre'r Gwaelod is comparable to the deluge myth found in nearly every ancient culture and it has been likened to the story of Atlantis. Several similar legends exist in Celtic mythology which refer to a lost land beneath the waves. Both the Breton legend of Ker-Ys and the Arthurian tale of Lyonesse refer to a kingdom submerged somewhere in the Celtic Sea, off the coast of Brittany or Cornwall respectively. A weaker parallel is the Gaelic otherworld T√≠r na n√ìg ('Land of Youth'), often conceived of an mystical land reached via a sea voyage; however, it lacks an inundation myth. Cultural references =Literature= The legend has inspired many poems and songs throughout the ages. The earliest mention of Cantre'r Gwaelod is thought to be in the thirteenth-century Black Book of Carmarthen in a poem called \\"Boddi Maes Gwyddno\\" (\\"The Drowning of the Land of Gwyddno\\") which relates the tale of Mererid and the well. The story inspired a Victorian era-novel, The Misfortunes of Elphin (1829), by Thomas Love Peacock. At the 1925 National Eisteddfod of Wales, held in Pwllheli, Dewi Morgan ('Dewi Teifi') won the Bardic Chair with his Awdl recounting the legend, adopting Thomas Love Peacock's version as the basis for his poetic rendition. Ptolemy's map of Great Britain and Ireland (1467 copy) Geologist William Ashton's 1920 book, The Evolution of a Coast-Line, Barrow to Aberystwyth and the Isle of Man, with Notes on Lost Towns, Submarine Discoveries, &C;, discusses the legend and takes Ptolemy's map as evidence of the existence of an area of lost land in Cardigan Bay. Ashton also includes a conjectural map of Cantre'r Gwaelod within the bay. (map illustration on page 257) Cantre'r Gwaelod is also featured in modern children's literature. Cantre'r Gwaelod is central to the setting of the 1977 Newbery Honor Book A String in the Harp by Nancy Bond. The kingdom also plays a major role in Silver on the Tree, the last book of The Dark Is Rising by Susan Cooper, parts of which are set in Aberdyfi. Si√¢n Lewis and Jackie Morris's book Cities in the Sea (2002) retells the legend for children, and Welsh musician Cerys Matthews's first children's book Tales from the Deep (2011) features a story, The Ghost Bells of the Lowlands, which was adapted from the legend of Cantre'r Gwaelod. =Music and art= The bells of St Peter's, Aberdyfi can play Clychau Aberdyfi The folk song \\"Clychau Aberdyfi\\" (\\"The Bells of Aberdovey\\"), popularised in the 18th century, relates to the part of the legend about the bells being heard ringing beneath the waves in the town of Aberdyfi. This song inspired cultural projects in the town involving bells; a new chime of bells was installed in September 1936 in the tower St Peter's Church, Aberdyfi, specifically designed to allow the playing of The Bells of Aberdovey. An art installation by the sculptor Marcus Vergette, a bronze \\"Time and Tide Bell\\", was mounted beneath the jetty in Aberdyfi Harbour in July 2011 as a homage to the folk song. The bell is rung by the action of water at high tide. =Local representation= In the 1990s the village of Aberdyfi had a small primary school which changed its school badge to show a raven surrounded by bells on a shield. The raven represented the nearby Corbett Estate which owned a large amount of land and built a number of houses. The raven can be seen on various buildings in the area. The school has since been closed and demolished, making way for affordable housing. =Television= An episode of the BBC CBeebies programme Telly Tales, first broadcast in 2009, featured a children's re-enactment of the legend of Cantre'r Gwaelod through a mixture of animation and live action. Cantre'r Gwaelod featured in the BBC documentary series Coast. Presenter Neil Oliver visited the sands of Aberdyfi and Ynyslas, near Borth, and examined the remains of the submerged forest and Sarn Badrig which are revealed at low tide, assisted by local historians and dendrochronologists.

Best known as the frontman of Dark Star and guitarist with Levitation, he has also released solo material as Mikrokosmos, which was produced by Tim Smith. Hayes explained that he was nicknamed Bic because he \\"just stopped eating for ages and people started saying I looked like a Bic biro. I had this phase when I thought eating was boring\\". Career Hayes first appeared on the south London psychedelic rock scene in the mid-1980s: by 1988 he was playing guitar with Ring, moving on to become bass player with The Dave Howard Singers in 1989. In the same year he joined Cardiacs as second guitarist, replacing departing saxophonist Sarah Smith. Hayes would appear as part of the band on their All That Glitters is a Mare's Nest live album and video: he would also make writing and recording contributions to their studio album Heaven Born and Ever Bright. During this period, he also worked on an intermittent thrash rock project called Panixphere. Hayes had come to know former House of Love guitarist Terry Bickers through musical friends in South London. During 1990, Bickers invited Hayes to join himself and drummer David Francolini in a new project which evolved into indie-psychedelic rock band Levitation (and into which Hayes recruited his former Ring bandmate, Robert White). Initially Hayes divided his time between Cardiacs and Levitation, but as the latter rapidly gained more and more attention from British audiences and the British music press, he found it difficult to accommodate both bands. He left Cardiacs (somewhat reluctantly) in May 1991, admitting \\"they were the band I left for Levitation. I loved Cardiacs and thought they were the best band in Britain at the time. That's how much I believed in Levitation. The chemistry was explosive\\". Although it's unclear how much of Hayes' contributions remained on Heaven Born and Ever Bright, he retained his friendship with Cardiacs. Whilst still in Levitation, Hayes briefly reformed Ring with David Francolini and Cardiacs frontman Tim Smith. Following the demise of Levitation in 1993, Hayes worked with Heather Nova and then with former All About Eve frontwoman Julianne Regan in a band called Mice. In 1996, he reunited with former Levitation bandmates David Francolini and Laurence O'Keefe to form Dark Star. Having released their debut album Twenty Twenty Sound in 1999, the band recorded a second album but it was not released as a result of personnel changes at their record company. An unmastered seven track version of the album, omitting the tracks \\"Roman Road\\" and \\"Valentine\\", was leaked within a couple of years of the split. Titled Zurich, it is unconfirmed whether this was an official title. The album remains unreleased, though Hayes has stated his hope to release the second album soon. Following the disbanding of Dark Star in 2001, Hayes toured with the Pet Shop Boys and worked as guitar tech/tour/production manager for the likes of My Bloody Valentine, Kula Shaker and David Cassidy. In 2007, Hayes began releasing archive releases of previously unreleased solo material (recording during and shortly after his time with Levitation) under the name of Mikrokosmos via Ingatia Recordings. A trio of releases -In The Heart of the Home, The Seven Stars and Terra Familiar - have been issued. In 2011, Hayes organised and compiled the tribute record Leader of the Starry Skies in aid of Cardiacs frontman Tim Smith (who had suffered two strokes in 2008 which left him paralysed down one side of his body and unable to speak). He also toured with a stage version of Macbeth in 2011 and 2012, produced by Platform 4 and described as \\"a taut psychodrama that crackles with a wild electricity, brought alive by the sonic experiments of composer and guitarist Bic Hayes and sound designer Jules Bushel\\". More recently Hayes has been involved in the Brighton-based improvisational instrumental psychedelic band ZOFFF (previously known as Light Specific Data or LSD-25) and with MUMMY (a duo with singer Jo Spratley).

As a musician, he plays several instruments, including acoustic guitar and organ. He is recognized for his successful music career as a member of Silence 4 and, since 2003, as a solo artist. He is also responsible for the graphic design on his album covers and the art direction on his videoclips. Between 2004 and 2006, he was also part of the Humanos tribute project. Beginnings David Fonseca studied cinema at the Lisbon Theatre and Film School (Escola Superior de Teatro e Cinema) where he attained a bachelor's degree. He also attended Escola Superior de Belas Artes de Lisboa between 1992 and 1994. David began his professional life as a photographer, working for various fashion catalogues. He participated in many exhibitions, both group and individual. He also worked in a radio station for a while. David Fonseca has dedicated his life to his love of music choosing to become a pop/rock alternative musician. He has multiple musical influences such as S√©rgio Godinho, Jeff Buckley, The B-52's, Pixies, Roy Orbison, Aphex Twin and Ryan Adams, all of whom had a huge role in his musical creativity and individuality. He also mentioned in an interview with radio station \\"Antena 3\\" that he has an addiction to the group Yeah Yeah Yeahs. David is married and has a son and a daughter. Career David Fonseca =Silence 4= Fonseca's musical career started with a band called Silence 4, formed by a group of hometown friends. They first released the unpredictable Silence Becomes It, in June 1998 that was a huge success at the time, selling 250,000 copies (the equivalent to six platinum records). This was a remarkable achievement in the Portuguese musical scene, where it is usually difficult to sell these many copies. The album has only two songs written in Portuguese. One of them is \\"Sexto Sentido\\", featuring the popular Portuguese singer, S√©rgio Godinho. To complete this great year for the band, which played at most of the Portuguese Summer festivals, they closed the world-famous exhibition Expo '98 in Lisbon, playing for about 50 thousand people. Later in the same year, in December, Silence 4 was the first national band to sell out at Pavilh√£o Atl√¢ntico, performing to an astonishing 18,000-strong crowd, only 6 months after the release of their first album. Two years after the \\"phenomenon\\" the second album was released, Only Pain Is Real, in July 2000, selling approximately 100,000 copies to this day. The respective tour ended in a double concert at the legendary stage in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, the Coliseu dos Recreios, which sold out completely and was released later on in CD and in DVD format. Throughout 2000, Silence 4 went on their last tour. In 2001, the band entered an undetermined hiatus, that still remains. =Solo career= Fonseca's solo career kicked off the 21st century with a different sound from Silence 4. In his first solo work Sing Me Something New, recorded in 2003, Fonseca sang and played nearly all the instruments, exploring a totally new environment of sounds on his own. The album was recorded in the studios of producer M√°rio Barreiros, and later in the Sterling Sound Studios in New York City, by the well-known sound engineer, George Marino, who participated in some of the recordings of Coldplay, the Rollins Band, The Dandy Warhols and Sepultura, among many others. The first single was Someone That Cannot Love which debuted on about 150 Portuguese radio stations in a coordinated release: they were all played on 10 March at midnight. It soon reached #2 on the National Sales Chart and was certified Gold. The tour supporting this first record was extensive; it included many big music venues and large festivals across Portugal. Our Hearts Will Beat As One, his second solo album, is said by Fonseca himself to be \\"scarily personal\\" and was only released in the fall of 2005 because of the other projects that Fonseca was involved in between his two albums. The first single was Who Are U?, described by Fonseca as \\"the song I always wanted to write\\". It reached No. 3 on the Portuguese charts. Our Hearts Will Beat As One was critically acclaimed by the media and was considered pop album of the year in Portugal, even before the end of the year. The album went straight to No. 1 on the National Sales Chart and reached Gold status on its first week of sales. In October 2007, his third original album, Dreams in Colour, was released and the first single was Superstars II, a song that obtained substantial airplay due to a cellphone campaign that adopted the single. In July 2009, the first single (\\"A Cry 4 Love\\") was finally released to the public. The new album, Between Waves, was out on 2 November 2009. On the same day, Fonseca's online community, Amazing Cats Club started working. Fonseca's fourth album entitled Seasons:Rising was released 21 March 2012. The first single What Life Is For came up on 4 February 2012. =Humanos= In 2004, David joined a new project called Humanos. The idea behind it was to record some unpublished songs by the famous Portuguese artist, a singer- songwriter, from the 1980s, Ant√≥nio Varia√ß√µes. David Fonseca, Manuela Azevedo (the lead singer of another Portuguese music group, Cl√£), Caman√© (one of the most famous Portuguese \\"fadistas\\"), S√©rgio Nascimento (a member of S√©rgio Godinho‚Äôs band), H√©lder Gon√ßalves (also from Cl√£), Nuno Rafael and Jo√£o Cardoso are the seven members of a group that would become a huge success, something unseen in the Portuguese music scene. The eponymous album scored an impressive quintuple platinum, staying for weeks at No. 1. \\"Muda de Vida\\", \\"Maria Albertina\\" and \\"Rugas\\" are just some of the group's hits. All this culminated in three sold-out concerts, two of them in \\"Coliseu dos Recreios\\" (Lisbon) and the other in Porto. There was also another memorable performance, in front of a crowd of 40,000 people, at the \\"Sudoeste\\" Portuguese Festival, in the year 2005. The Humanos were always intended to be a short project, because there were few unpublished Antonio Varia√ß√µes‚Äô songs. Thus, the CD and DVD with the recorded Coliseums‚Äô live concerts, which was released on November 2006, marked the end of the Humanos project. Live concerts David Fonseca is known by his powerful dancing on stage, equipped with his pair of Chuck Taylor All-Stars. He plays different instruments during the show and he is accompanied by his band, which includes: S√©rgio Nascimento (drummer), Ricardo Fiel (guitarist), Rita Redshoes (ex-Atomic Bees in the piano and also voices; the second record single \\"Hold Still\\" is a David and Rita duet), Nuno Sim√µes (bass player) and Paulo Pereira (hammond). David doesn't just play his solo- career hits but also lesser-known tracks. He also plays (in most of his live concerts) \\"Angel Song\\", the first music he wrote, composed when he was only 18 and which was included in Silence 4's first album. This theme is perhaps the one most loved among fans, of the group or of David. In the middle of the show, he usually leaves the stage to return wearing a white suit, to announce that \\"dancing time\\" has begun and that the \\"moonwalk\\" move is near.

The word palustrine comes from the Latin word palus or marsh. Wetlands within this category include inland marshes and swamps as well as bogs, fens, tundra and floodplains. According to the Cowardin classification system Palustrine wetlands can also be considered the area on the side of a river or a lake, as long as they are covered by vegetation such as trees, shrubs, and emergent plants.  Classification  Palustrine wetlands are one of five systems of wetlands within the Cowardin classification system. This system was created by Lewis Cowardin and others from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 1987. The other systems are: * Marine wetlands, exposed to the open ocean * Estuarine wetlands, partially enclosed by land and containing a mix of fresh and salt water * Riverine wetlands, associated with flowing water * Lacustrine wetlands, associated with a lake or other body of fresh water  Vegetation  The vegetation within a Palustrine system typically contains multiple species that are similar. This different groups of vegetation are aquatic bed, emergent, scrub-shrub, and forested. * Aquatic bed vegetation typically includes floating-leaved plants, pondweed and waterlilies. * Emergent vegetation commonly includes cattails, bulrushes, reeds, pickerel weed, arrowheads and ferns. * Scrub-shrub wetland is dominated by woody vegetation less than 20 feet tall, such as buttonbush, alders, and many kinds of saplings. * Forested palustrine wetland is dominated by woody vegetation over 20 feet tall.

It is based on Ritchie's real-life police chase inside a 1979 Porsche 928.IRC Chat with Steve Ritchie He was finally caught in Lodi, California on Interstate 5 and accused of speeding at 146 mph.http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=1176 A sequel was released 1992 called The Getaway: High Speed II.  Gameplay  The main object of the game is to turn the main stoplight (located on the ramp) from green to yellow to red by hitting the nine stoplight targets (three of each color). Shooting the ball up the ramp or into the eject hole (saucer) also spots a stoplight target. Once all nine have been lit, the objective is to shoot the ball up the ramp again, thus \\"running the red light,\\" and starting the police chase mode. To escape the police, the player can either shoot the ball up the ramp again (a Getaway) or by lighting all nine stoplight targets again and then shooting the eject hole (an Escape), starting multi-ball. Once multi-ball begins, all targets, spinners, and bumper shots increase the Hideout Jackpot (which carries over from game to game until won, and begins at 250,000 points, growing to a maximum of 2 million points). To win the jackpot, the player must shoot the ramp once again. Another main feature of the game is the Freeways; one is located in each of the left and right orbits, denoted by spinners (and a third spinner leads to the eject hole). Shooting either one of the two inlanes or making a loop around one of the orbits lights a Freeway, and the player then has 5 seconds to shoot the lit orbit again, scoring the Freeway value, increasing from 25,000 to 100,000 points, and eventually lighting an extra ball (which can be collected by shooting the eject hole). Shooting the ball up the ramp also increases the bonus multiplier from 2X up to 5X, any additional shots beyond 5X activate the BONUS HELD. Once the jackpot has been won, the player can then attempt to light all nine stoplight targets again (as long as multi-ball is still going), and doing so lights a special, which can be collected if the ball drains in the correct outlane. Extra balls will be given, but once five of them are earned in a game, a score award is added per one earned thereafter. Production During its design, High Speed was jokingly called \\"High Cost\\" by some rival Williams designers due to its then- high production cost. The advances in the mechanical design that went into High Speed, coupled with the machine's popularity, led to many machines being kept in service much longer than was previously the norm. The play surfaces of the machine were not initially given as much attention, leading to many High Speed machines seeing service to this day in extremely worn condition. Williams rapidly addressed this issue by making mylar playfield covers available and later adding hard clear paint coats to their playfields. Canadian specialist Classic Playfield Reproductions produced an officially licensed High Speed 13-color Reproduction Playfield, which shipped as limited edition in 2014.

The Super Classic of Cuban National Series takes place six times per season between Industriales and Santiago de Cuba, the Cuban equivalent of the New York Yankees‚ÄìBoston Red Sox rivalry. The matchup also represents the rivalry between the two cities (La Habana and Santiago de Cuba), dating back to the era when Cuba was a colony of Spain more than two centuries ago. They are known as the Lions (los leones), \\"The Blues\\" (los azules) or \\"The Blue Lions\\" (los Leones Azules). Royal blue is their color, though teams like Camag√ºey and Ciego de √Åvila also have blue uniforms (navy blue and sky blue, respectively.) History The team was founded in 1962, as representatives of all the workers from all the industries of Cuba.

The Miami Beach Police are famous for their bicycle patrols, which wear dark blue shorts and white short-sleeve uniform tops. The bicycle patrols were created due to the frequent traffic congestion of the Miami Beach isles (particularly in the famous Ocean Drive area on South Beach). Bicycle patrols go where patrol vehicles cannot, but they also perform traffic duties.Homepage of Flagler Beach Police Department, retrieved on July 25, 2009 There are even some patrol officers on roller skates. The Miami Beach Police wear dark blue trousers with dark blue shirts, and have red, white, and blue patrol vehicles however, the department is in the process of switching over to black and white patrol vehicles by the end of 2008. The current Chief of the Department is Chief Daniel Oates. Incidents In recent years, the Miami Beach Police Department has come under scrutiny for their involvement in a series of questionable incidents. In 2009, two officers were accused of taunting and falsely arresting a gay man. In another incident, one of their officers was arrested on felony charges for a crash in an all-terrain vehicle, seriously injuring and hospitalizing two people. The arrested officer and a second officer had been drinking on-duty with a group of women who were having a bachelorette party at a local nightspot prior to the crash. In another incident, officers fired approximately 100 shots at a motorist during a busy Urban Weekend celebration surrounding Memorial Day; numerous innocent bystanders were injured by police bullets. After several years of scrutiny, the investigation remains open. In August 2013, a teenage graffiti artist was chased by police after being observed tagging an abandoned building. The teenager subsequently died after being shot with a Taser. His family has filed a lawsuit against the city of Miami Beach.

Snuffy also appears, even though his names are revealed to be Mr. Snuffleupagus and Aloysius Snuffleupagus; however, at this point in the show's history, he is still the imaginary friend of Big Bird, never seen by the other characters on Sesame Street. Plot The Sesame Street gang have gone on a field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Big Bird has arranged to meet with Snuffy at the museum but before he can, it is closing time. Big Bird decides to go off and look for Snuffy. Before the group can leave, they realize Big Bird is missing and run all through the museum looking for him. The chase has them going through different exhibits at high speed and missing, spotting, and chasing him. After a bit, they give up, only to find that they are locked in the museum overnight. They decide to go back out and look for Big Bird and look at all the exhibits while they are at it. Big Bird eventually finds Snuffy and they wander the Egyptian exhibit and encounter an Egyptian prince named Sahu (Aram Chowdhury) and his cat who have been cursed to remain on Earth and not be able to become a star like his parents until he answers the question \\"Where does today meet yesterday?\\" Every night at midnight for thousands of years, a demon (James Mason) appears to ask Sahu that and he has answered wrong every night. Big Bird suggests Sahu remain on Earth and become \\"the only 4,000 year old kid on Sesame Street\\", but later agrees with Snuffy that they should work together to get the answer right. Meanwhile, the group has split up and are all in different exhibits. Bob and Cookie Monster find themselves looking at pictures with food in them. While Cookie Monster tries to eat the pictures, Bob points out to him a sign that says \\"Please don't eat the pictures.\\" He replies with \\"Oh, this going to be a long night.\\" He later sings the song \\"Don't Eat the Pictures\\" about this. Oscar finds an exhibit of Greek and Roman statues that have been broken by natural disasters. He looks in and breaks into song on how beautiful they are to him. Grover finds an exhibit filled with armor from medieval times and thinks a suit of Maximilian armour is a guy named \\"Max\\" and tries to befriend him by changing into his Super Grover costume and singing a song. Bert and Ernie view the painting of Washington Crossing the Delaware, to which Bert comments on the dedication of Washington and his men, but Ernie comments how he was very silly to cross in the winter and should have waited until Easter or taken the George Washington Bridge. As the night passes, Big Bird and Snuffy continue to try to figure out the answer to the question. Soon just before midnight Big Bird unknowingly figures out the answer is \\"a museum.\\" When the demon appears that night, the question is answered correctly and Sahu is sent to Osiris (Fritz Weaver) to have his heart weighed. When the feather to weigh his heart doesn't appear, Big Bird offers one of his to help. But when Sahu's heart is too heavy, Big Bird claims that it wasn't fair since Sahu was on Earth for 40 centuries and he was so alone his heart would be heavy, so he can't become a star. After this, Sahu's heart becomes lighter and he is now ready to join his parents and take his cat. Big Bird and Snuffy then exit the museum, look up into the night sky, and see four stars in a straight line (representing Sahu, his parents, and his cat), and are glad that they reunited Sahu with his parents. When morning comes, Big Bird finds the group and Snuffy is not there. He got up early and left to get to \\"Snufflegarden.\\" Cookie Monster was promised anything on a hot dog stand as a special reward for not eating anything in the museum, and decides to eat the entire stand. After the credits, Big Bird pretends to be a statue. He encourages the viewers to visit their local museum, and comments on how staying perfectly still is tiring and wonders how statues can do it.

Life A \\"Life of Nectan\\", along with an account of the finding of his body and a collection of miracle stories, can be found in a 14th-century manuscript now in Gotha. The \\"Life\\" has been dated to the end of the 12th century. Its account holds that Nectan was born in Ireland[3] but moved to Wales when he was young in 423 AD, the eldest of the 24 children of King Brychan of Brycheiniog (now Brecknock in Wales). Nectan heard of the great hermit of the Egyptian desert, St. Anthony, and was inspired to imitate his way of life. Seeking greater solitude, St. Nectan and his companions left Wales, intending to settle wherever their boat happened to land. Nectan and his companions wound up on the northern coast of Devon at Hartland, where they lived for several years in a dense forest. The saint‚Äôs family would visit him there on the last day of the year. Later, he relocated to a remote valley with a spring.\\"Martyr Nectan of Hartland\\", Orthodox Church in America At Hartland, Nectan lived in the solitude of a remote valley where he helped a swineherd recover his lost pigs and in turn was given a gift of two cows. Nectan's cows were stolen and after finding them he attempted to convert the robbers to the Christian faith. In return he was attacked by robbers who cut off his head. The same authority says that he picked his head up and walked back to his well before collapsing and dying. Seeing this, the man who killed St Nectan went out of his mind, but the other thief buried him. From that time, miracles began to take place at St Nectan‚Äôs tomb. Tradition also says that wherever Nectan's blood fell, foxgloves grew. Nectan is also associated with St Nectan's Glen and Waterfall at Trethevy, near Tintagel, in Cornwall, where it is claimed he spent some time as a hermit. Nectan is believed to have sited his hermitage above the waterfall. According to legend, he rang a silver bell in times of stormy weather to warn shipping of the perils of the rocks at the mouth of the Rocky Valley.\\"St. Nectan's Glen History\\", St. Nectan's Glen Nectan is also said to have appeared in 937, on the eve of the Battle of Brunanburh. A young man from Hartland felt himself afflicted with the plague called upon God and St Nectan to help him. Nectan appeared to the young man just after midnight and touched the afflicted area of his body, healing him. When King Athelstan heard of this, asked for more information about St Nectan. The young man urged the king to have faith in St Nectan with faith, and he would be victorious. After the battle, Athelstan visited Hartland and donated property to the saint‚Äôs church. Veneration Church of Saint Nectan at Stoke by Hartland After Nectan's death, a considerable cult grew up around his shrine and this continued to be popular throughout the Middle Ages, supported both by Saxon kings and Norman lords. Lyfing, Bishop of Crediton, approved the translation of his body as an accomplished fact, providing bells, lead for the roof, and a sculptured reliquary for the church. Furthermore, Nectan's staff was decorated with gold, silver and jewels. Manors were given to the church to endow it against pirates. The church and shrine were restored and in the possession of the Augustinian secular canons from the adjoining Hartland Abbey from the 12th century until such monastic orders were disestablished during the Reformation. A number of other churches in Devon are dedicated to St Nectan, but only two ancient ones: Welcombe, just south of Hartland, and probably originally Ashton (now St John the Baptist). There is also a medieval chapel of Saint Nectan near St Winnow in Cornwall as well as a church dedicated to St. Nectan in the village of Ashcombe in Devon. Nectan's feast day is 17 June, the supposed day of his death (traditionally around 510), which was kept in Launceston, Exeter and Wells; there is still a tradition of taking foxgloves to his well on that day. Other dates include the 18 May,Roscarrock 14 February Wilson's Martyrology (1640) and 4 December (the date of his translation). =Patronage= Nectan is the patron saint of Hartland, Devon.

In addition, the term is often used unofficially to refer to a pair of games played by a team in a single day, but in front of different crowds and not in immediate succession. In Major League Baseball, for many decades, doubleheaders were routinely scheduled several times each season. However, today a doubleheader is generally the result of a prior game between the same two teams being postponed due to inclement weather or other factors. Most often the game is rescheduled for a day on which the two teams play each other again. Often it is within the same series, but in some cases, may be weeks or months after the original date. On rare occasions, the last game between two teams in that particular city is rained out, and a doubleheader may be scheduled at the other team's home park to replace the missed game. Currently, major league teams playing two games in a day usually play a \\"day-night doubleheader\\", in which the stadium is emptied of spectators and a separate admission is required for the second game. However, such games are officially regarded as separate games on the same date, rather than as a doubleheader. True doubleheaders are less commonly played, and usually are of the \\"twi- night\\" variety. Classic doubleheaders, also known as day doubleheaders, were more common in the past, and although they are rare in the major leagues, they still are played at the minor league and college levels. In 1959, at least one league played a quarter of their games as classic doubleheaders. The rate declined to 10% in 1979. Eventually, eight years passed between two officially scheduled doubleheaders. Reasons for the decline include clubs' desire to maximize revenue, longer duration of games, five-day pitching rotation as opposed to four-day rotation, time management of relievers and catchers, and lack of consensus among players. The record for the most doubleheaders played by a team in a season is 44 by the Chicago White Sox in 1943. Between September 4 and September 15, 1928, the Boston Braves played nine consecutive doubleheaders ‚Äì 18 games in 12 days. Twi-night In a twi-night (short for \\"twilight-night\\") doubleheader, the first game is played in the late afternoon; after the first game ends, a break of 20 to 30 minutes occurs, after which the second game is played. A spectator may attend both games by purchasing a single ticket. Under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, this is allowed provided the start time of the first game is no later than 5:00 p.m. local time, although they generally start at 4:00 p.m. For statistical purposes, the attendance is counted only for the second game, with the first game's attendance recorded as zero. This type of doubleheader is more common in Minor League Baseball as the result of rainouts. They are also played in Major League cities with open-air ballparks and climates that are too extreme for day games. Classic The \\"classic\\" doubleheader is like the twi-night doubleheader except the first game is played in the early afternoon and the second in the late afternoon. This was often done out of necessity in the years before many ballparks had lights; often, if either game went into extra innings, the second game was eventually called due to darkness. However, it is presently less common in the major leagues, even for rain makeups, since the use of lights in baseball stadiums allows most games to be scheduled for the night. Like the twi-night doubleheader, this type of doubleheader is more prominent in the minor leagues. On June 10, 2017, the Tampa Bay Rays and Oakland Athletics played a scheduled single-admission day-day doubleheader in St. Petersburg. Day-night In a \\"day-night doubleheader\\", the first game is played in the early afternoon and the second is played at night; in this scenario, spectators must buy separate tickets to gain admittance to both games. Except in special circumstances by the approval of the MLBPA, such as a makeup game resulting from a rain-out, this is prohibited under the terms of the 2002 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). On August 22, 2012, the Miami Marlins played a day-night doubleheader at the Arizona Diamondbacks due to a scheduling error violating another section of the CBA, which prohibits 23 consecutive games without a day off. The Elias Sports Bureau does not include this as a doubleheader for the sake of record books, nor do the official playing rules recognize such games as official doubleheaders. However, they are favored by MLB clubs because they can realize revenue from gate receipts for two games. Since the , the CBA has allowed teams to expand their active roster to 26 players for day-night doubleheaders, as long as those doubleheaders were scheduled with at least 48 hours' notice. Reckoning by U.S. time zones, the began with a day-night doubleheader on March 22, 2014, between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks. These games were played in Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday evening, March 22, and Sunday afternoon, March 23, local time; their start times were 1:00 AM and 7:00 PM Pacific Daylight Time on March 22, 2014. ESPN includes this two-game set in its list of doubleheaders played during the 2014 season.MLB Doubleheaders - 2014 ‚Äî ESPN Tripleheaders Three instances of a tripleheader are recorded in MLB, indicating three games between the same two teams on the same day. These occurred between the Brooklyn Bridegrooms and Pittsburgh Innocents on September 1, 1890 (Brooklyn won all three); between the Baltimore Orioles and Louisville Colonels on September 7, 1896 (Baltimore won all three); and between the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati Reds on October 2, 1920 (Cincinnati won two of the three). Tripleheaders are now prohibited under the current CBA, except when the first game is the conclusion of a game suspended from a prior date. This would only happen in the extremely rare case when the only remaining dates between teams are doubleheaders and no single games are left for the suspended game to precede. Seven-inning doubleheaders Under some rulesets, games played as part of a doubleheader last seven innings each instead of the usual nine. =In college and minor league baseball= In college and the minor leagues, however, the doubleheader also results in shorter games. In most instances, both ends of such a doubleheader are seven innings, even if it is a playoff game; in 1994, the first game of the five- game Pacific Coast League championship series between Vancouver and Albuquerque was rained out; the two teams played a doubleheader, seven innings each, on the originally scheduled date of the second game. In the minors, the only exception is when the first game is the completion of a suspended game from a prior day; i.e., the game was started, but was halted by weather before becoming an official game. In these cases, the suspended game is played to completion (seven or nine innings, whichever it was scheduled to be when it started), and the second game of the doubleheader is seven innings. =In Major League Baseball= After the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the start of the 2020 MLB season to July from its original intended start in March, Major League Baseball announced on July 31 that doubleheader games starting August 1 would last seven innings each during the shortened seasonhttps://mlb.nbcsports.com/2020/07/31/new-doubleheader-rule-is-official- games-will-be-seven-innings-long/https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-will- play-seven-inning-doubleheaders-in-shortened-2020-season-as-league-union- reach-agreement/, to reduce strain on teams' pitchers. The league and the MLB Players Association (MLBPA) came to an agreement to put this rule in place only for the 2020 season. If the game goes to extra innings, the runner-on- second rule (in which a runner is put on second base to start every extra inning) applies starting in the eighth inning. Prior to the passage of this rule change, one conventional double-header with nine innings each had been played on July 28 between the Cleveland Indians and the Chicago White Sox. https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CLE/CLE202007282.shtml On August 2, the first seven-inning doubleheader happened between the Cincinnati Reds and the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park, with the Reds winning both games. https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/DET/DET202008021.shtmlhttps://apnews.com/eaee2c59832463d3fed85ba800969d1d =Statistical impact= Some feats that could be done in a seven-inning game would be counted as is, while others would require extra innings, such as a shutout credit being applied if done so in a seven-inning game, while a no- hitter would only be counted if the game was tied after seven innings and went at least two extra innings. Reds pitcher Trevor Bauer threw the first complete seven-inning shutout in the second game under the rule. https://www.mlb.com/news/seven-inning-doubleheaders-no-hitter- ruleshttps://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/DET/DET202008022.shtml Doubleheaders of note The home-and-home doubleheader, where each team hosts one game, is extremely rare, as it requires the teams' home ballparks to be in close geographical proximity. During the 20th century and before the advent of interleague play in 1997, only one instance was recorded in Major League Baseball‚Äîa Labor Day special event involving the New York Giants and Brooklyn Superbas. * September 7, 1903 ** Game 1: Washington Park (II): Giants 6, Superbas 4 ** Game 2: Polo Grounds (III): Superbas 3, Giants 0 This is the only home-and-home doubleheader known to have been part of the original major league season schedule. Since interleague play began, the New York Mets and the New York Yankees have on three occasions played home-and-home doubleheaders. Each occasion was due to a rainout during the first series of the season. During the second series of the season, a makeup game was scheduled at the ballpark of the opposing team as part of a day-night doubleheader. * July 8, 2000 ** Game 1: Shea Stadium: Yankees 4, Mets 2 ** Game 2: Yankee Stadium (I): Yankees 4, Mets 2 (June 11 makeup) * June 28, 2003 ** Game 1: Yankee Stadium (I): Yankees 7, Mets 1 ** Game 2: Shea Stadium: Yankees 9, Mets 8 (June 21 makeup) * June 27, 2008 ** Game 1: Yankee Stadium (I): Mets 15, Yankees 6 (May 16 makeup) ** Game 2: Shea Stadium: Yankees 9, Mets 0 On September 13, 1951, the St. Louis Cardinals hosted a doubleheader against two different teams. The first game was a 6‚Äì4 win against the New York Giants. The second game resulted in a 2‚Äì0 loss to the Boston Braves. On September 25, 2000, the Cleveland Indians also hosted a doubleheader against two different teams. The September 10 game against the Chicago White Sox in Cleveland had been rained out. With no common days off for the remainder of the season and both teams in a postseason race, the teams agreed to play a day game in Cleveland on the same day that the Indians were to host the Minnesota Twins for a night game. The Indians defeated the White Sox 9‚Äì2 in the first game, while the Twins defeated the Indians 4‚Äì3 in the second. On occasion, a doubleheader may occur where the games are played at the same park, but one team is designated home for each game. This is usually the result of earlier postponements. This first occurred in the modern era in 2007, when snow storms in northern Ohio caused the Cleveland Indians to postpone their home-opening series against the Seattle Mariners; three of the games were made up in Cleveland when both teams had off days during various points in the season, while the fourth was made up as part of a doubleheader in Seattle on September 26, 2007, with the Indians as the designated home team for the first game. The Indians won the first game acting as the home team 12‚Äì4, but lost the second as the road team 3‚Äì2. Incidence of swept doubleheaders In a paper in American Statistician, Michael Goodman makes the claim that doubleheaders are swept more often than they are split. Recently, this has held more or less true: in 2013, 18 of 25 doubleheaders were swept, but in 2012, only 10 of 20 were swept. As of July 31, 2014, 11 of 19 doubleheaders had been swept in 2014.

Weinbaum that first appeared in the March 1936 issue of Astounding Stories. \\"Redemption Cairn\\" is the only Weinbaum story set on Europa. Weinbaum's Europa In Weinbaum's Solar System, in keeping with the then-current \\"near- collision\\" hypothesis of planetary formation, Jupiter radiates enough heat to create Earth-like environments on the Galilean moons. Europa is airless except for a depression on the Jupiter-facing side of the tidally locked moon, which holds a thin, but breathable atmosphere. This region is divided into a number of small valleys separated from each other by ridges rising above the atmosphere. The most widespread Europan species is the bladder bird, which carries its own air supply with it in an air sac, allowing it to cross over the airless peaks. Plot summary Jack Sands, the story's narrator, is a spaceship pilot down on his luck. In September 2111, he is about to be evicted from a flophouse when he is recruited by his old friend Captain Harris Henshaw to co-pilot an expedition to Europa. Sands is one of only two survivors of a previous visit to the Jovian moon. The other was his drug-addled co-pilot Kratska, who crashed the expedition's ship, the Hera, while landing it on Earth. While Sands lay unconscious in a hospital, Kratska put the blame for the crash on him, ruining his reputation. Kratska has since disappeared. Sands' new co-pilot is Claire \\"The Golden Flash\\" Avery, whose sole qualification was winning the circumlunar Apogee race; more by sheer luck and suicidal risk-taking than by skill, in Sands' opinion. The other members of the expedition are the chemist Stefan Coretti and the biologist Gogrol. Sands has proof of Avery's poor piloting ability during the landing on Europa, when he is forced to take over to prevent her from crashing the Minos. His suspicions are aroused when he realizes the crew of the Minos are doing no actual exploring. One day, he and Avery return from gathering food to find Henshaw shot dead and Coretti wounded by Gogrol. The biologist forces the two pilots into the next valley and then crosses back over the airless ridge connecting them wearing an air helmet. He takes their helmets with him, so they can't follow. Avery then tells Sands the real purpose of the mission: Captain Gunderson of the Hera had discovered vast deposits of protactinium on the previous expedition, and worked out a process for using it as a power source. Gunderson was lost in the crash, along with his notes, but it was hoped that he had left a copy behind on Europa. Now Gogrol has found the notes. Gogrol returns because he needs one of them to pilot the ship to one of the human settlements on Io. He shoots Sands in the leg and abducts Avery; when she passes out on top of the ridge, he picks her up and carries her, then tosses his pistol down to Sands with one shot left, so Sands can commit suicide. Instead, Sands shoots a native bladder bird and uses its air sac to keep breathing as he gives chase. He catches up to Gogrol in the darkened spaceship control room, finally recognizing him as Kratska. Sands sends Avery outside to retrieve Coretti; Kratska chooses that moment to attack Sands, but Sands manages to kill Kratska before passing out. When Sands comes to, he is travelling in space aboard the Minos, which Avery has piloted to Io. Sands enters the control room in time to watch her make a perfect landing.

Starfighters were chosen as support for AC/DC's Back in Black UK Tour in 1980. Starfighters also opened several dates for Ozzy Osbourne in 1982. Starfighters split in 1983 before coming back together in 1987 for another shot. When that did not work out, Young formed Little Big Horn whose demo tape was produced by Malcolm Young. They soon broke up after a lack of success in signing a record deal, although not before they had recorded a session for Tommy Vance's Friday Rock Show on BBC Radio 1. Stevie later formed Up Rising, a band that also split up. Starfighters are mentioned in the book Get Your Jumbo Jet Out of My Airport (Random Notes for AC/DC Obsessives) and also feature in the 2007 rare record guide. In 1988 Young produced a demo for death/thrash metal band Cancer titled No Fuckin' Cover. In 2009 Young was a member of Birmingham rock band Hellsarockin. When Starfighters bassist Doug Dennis died in 2011, the remaining Starfighters reformed to play at his wake with Young's son Angus on bass.https://scontent.flhr2-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/252204_226355077375329_2770544_n.jpg?oh=208745c9d52076bfb9b5cccd62bdcd86&oe;=5927E9A4 From July 2013 Young and Pat Hambly from the Starfighters performed in a blues trio with singer Martin Wood called Blue Murda. Blue Murda were later joined on guitar by Young's son, Angus (Gus), and John Malan on bass guitar. Gus is the grand-nephew of AC/DC's Angus Young and was briefly a member of AC/DC tribute band AC/DC UK. =Career with AC/DC= The connection to AC/DC goes back to the 1960s where Stevie, Angus and Malcolm attended the same school and played guitar together while growing up in Sydney. Coincidentally, Starfighters was also the name of a Dutch band of AC/DC co-producer Harry Vanda, before his family moved to Australia. During the late 1970s Young and his brother Fraser occasionally travelled with AC/DC on tour; both were photographed with Angus and Malcolm backstage at Wembley in 1979 during the Highway to Hell Tour. During the 1988 US tour for AC/DC's album Blow Up Your Video, which started on 3 May 1988, Young filled in for Malcolm on rhythm guitar, while Malcolm left to deal with a growing alcohol dependency. Many fans were not even aware that Malcolm had been replaced, because Young bore a physical resemblance (at the time) to him. Malcolm overcame his drinking problem and returned to the band, staying until his retirement in 2014. In July 2014, AC/DC's Brian Johnson confirmed that Young had recorded with the band for their upcoming album Rock or Bust, again replacing his ill uncle Malcolm. In September it was confirmed that Young would replace Malcolm on a permanent basis. It was revealed in a Rolling Stone interview that Young had been recruited by Angus as far back as January 2014, before contact had been made with other band members. Equipment Young has played a selection of Gretsch Jet Firebirds throughout his career. His first was a black, left- handed Firebird which was modified with an additional set of half-moon fret inlays on the fingerboard, and had the neck pick-up removed. It had an additional jack slot fitted, and a Burns tailpiece. This Firebird was inherited from Malcolm Young, and was used to record with Starfighters in the early 1980s. Young also inherited another Firebird from Malcolm Young; this one was almost exactly the same as Malcolm's main Gretsch, with the neck pick- up removed, a third pick-up cavity, and the finish removed to leave clear maple. It has a Burns tailpiece, and was Young's no. 1 guitar on AC/DC's Rock Or Bust World tour. Young uses 0.011 gauge strings for his high E string, although when playing AC/DC material he retains Malcolm's string gauge of 0.012\\" with a wound G string. For the Rock or Bust tour, Young used Marshall Amplifiers with Celestion Creamback and Classic Lead 80 speakers as part of his touring set-up. Family As of July 2014 Young's son Angus (known as Goose or Gus) also plays guitar for Birmingham reggae band Young Culture Collective alongside his younger brother, also called Stevie.

The receptor interacts with both luteinizing hormone (LH) and chorionic gonadotropins (such as hCG in humans) and represents a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Its activation is necessary for the hormonal functioning during reproduction.  LHCGR gene  The gene for the LHCGR is found on chromosome 2 p21 in humans, close to the FSH receptor gene. It consists of 70 kbp (versus 54 kpb for the FSHR). The gene is similar to the gene for the FSH receptor and the TSH receptor.  Receptor structure  The LHCGR consists of 674 amino acids and has a molecular mass of about 85‚Äì95 kDA based on the extent of glycosylation. Like other GPCRs, the LHCG receptor possess seven membrane-spanning domains or transmembrane helices. The extracellular domain of the receptor is heavily glycosylated. These transmembrane domains contain two highly conserved cysteine residues, which build disulfide bonds to stabilize the receptor structure. The transmembrane part is highly homologous with other members of the rhodopsin family of GPCRs. The C-terminal domain is intracellular and brief, rich in serine and threonine residues for possible phosphorylation.  Ligand binding and signal transduction  Upon binding of LH to the external part of the membrane spanning receptor, a transduction of the signal takes place that activates the G protein that is bound to the receptor internally. With LH attached, the receptor shifts conformation and thus mechanically activates the G protein, which detaches from the receptor and activates the cAMP system. It is believed that a receptor molecule exists in a conformational equilibrium between active and inactive states. The binding of LH (or CG) to the receptor shifts the equilibrium between active and inactive receptors. LH and LH-agonists shift the equilibrium in favor of active states; LH antagonists shift the equilibrium in favor of inactive states. For a cell to respond to LH only a small percentage (‚âà1%) of receptor sites need to be activated. = Phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinases = Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases (protein kinase A) are activated by the signal chain coming from the G protein (that was activated by the LHCG-receptor) via adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP (cAMP). These protein kinases are present as tetramers with two regulatory units and two catalytic units. Upon binding of cAMP to the regulatory units, the catalytic units are released and initiate the phosphorylation of proteins leading to the physiologic action. The cyclic AMP-regulatory dimers are degraded by phosphodiesterase and release 5‚ÄôAMP. DNA in the cell nucleus binds to phosphorylated proteins through the cyclic AMP response element (CRE), which results in the activation of genes. The signal is amplified by the involvement of cAMP and the resulting phosphorylation. The process is modified by prostaglandins. Other cellular regulators that participate are the intracellular calcium concentration modified by phospholipase, nitric acid, and other growth factors. In a feedback mechanism, these activated kinases phosphorylate the receptor. The longer the receptor remains active the more kinases are activated and the more receptors are phosphorylated. Other pathways of signaling exist for the LHCGR.  Action  389x389pxIt specifically acts to up-regulate the enzyme cholesterol side chain cleaving enzyme, which leads to the greater conversion of cholesterol into androgen precursors required to make many steroid hormones, including testosterone and estrogens. = Ovary = In the ovary, the LHCG receptor is necessary for follicular maturation and ovulation, as well as luteal function. Its expression requires appropriate hormonal stimulation by FSH and estradiol. The LHCGR is present on granulosa cells, theca cells, luteal cells, and interstitial cells The LCGR is restimulated by increasing levels of chorionic gonadotropins in case a pregnancy is developing. In turn, luteal function is prolonged and the endocrine milieu is supportive of the nascent pregnancy. = Testis = In the male the LHCGR has been identified on the Leydig cells that are critical for testosterone production, and support spermatogenesis. Normal LHCGR functioning is critical for male fetal development, as the fetal Leydig cells produce testosterone to induce masculinization. = Extragonadal = LHCGR have been found in many types of extragonadal tissues, and the physiologic role of some has remained largely unexplored. Thus receptors have been found in the uterus, sperm, seminal vesicles, prostate, skin, breast, adrenals, thyroid, neural retina, neuroendocrine cells, and (rat) brain.  Receptor regulation  The seven transmembrane Œ±-helix structure of a G protein-coupled receptor such as LHCGR = Upregulation = Upregulation refers to the increase in the number of receptor sites on the membrane. Estrogen and FSH upregulate LHCGR sites in preparation for ovulation. After ovulation, the luteinized ovary maintains LHCGR s that allow activation in case there is an implantation. = Desensitization = The LHCGRs become desensitized when exposed to LH for some time. A key reaction of this downregulation is the phosphorylation of the intracellular (or cytoplasmic) receptor domain by protein kinases. This process uncouples Gs protein from the LHCGR. Another way to desensitize is to uncouple the regulatory and catalytic units of the cAMP system. = Downregulation = Downregulation refers to the decrease in the number of receptor sites. This can be accomplished by metabolizing bound LHCGR sites. The bound LCGR complex is brought by lateral migration to a coated pit, where such units are concentrated and then stabilized by a framework of clathrins. A pinched-off coated pit is internalized and degraded by lysosomes. Proteins may be metabolized or the receptor can be recycled. Use of long-acting agonists will downregulate the receptor population. = Modulators = Antibodies to LHCGR can interfere with LHCGR activity.  LHCGR abnormalities  Loss-of-function mutations in females can lead to infertility. In 46, XY individuals severe inactivation can cause male pseudohermaphroditism, as fetal Leydig cells during may not respond and thus interfere with masculinization. Less severe inactivation can result in hypospadias or a micropenis.  History  Alfred G. Gilman and Martin Rodbell received the 1994 Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology for the discovery of the G Protein System.

A doubleheader purposely coincides with a league's scheduling of \\"early\\" and \\"late\\" games. In North America, games usually start at the same time period in different time zones (Eastern and Pacific). American football =National Football League= National Football League (NFL) games played in the usually start around 1:00 p.m. or 4:00 pm Eastern Time, creating a 1:00/4:00 p.m. doubleheader in the Eastern Time Zone and a 10:00 a.m./1:00 p.m. doubleheader in the Pacific Time Zone. The two networks that hold the rights to broadcast NFL games on Sunday afternoons ‚Äì Fox and CBS ‚Äì both typically air doubleheaders during the regular season (with the other network only being permitted to broadcast one game in a specific market; each network is given eight doubleheaders to broadcast during the season, and both networks are given doubleheaders during the final week of the season in order for games with playoff implications to have the most exposure), with restrictions applying to some markets in which the local team is playing at home that week. When combined with the Sunday night game on NBC, this creates a tripleheader (as was sometimes advertised by the league's radio partner, Westwood One, which carried three games in a tripleheader format). Since 2006, Week 1 of the NFL regular season also features a doubleheader on Monday Night Football (which moved from ABC to ESPN concurrent with the change), with the late-evening game involving two West Coast teams. This alleviates a quirk in the NFL television contract where there is no Monday game in the final week of the regular season in order to allow all playoff teams to have an equal number of days off between the final regular season and first playoff game. A daytime doubleheader occurred on October 26, 2014, when Fox was given the rights to broadcast a game between the Atlanta Falcons and Detroit Lions at Wembley Stadium in London, resulting in Fox and CBS both being allocated doubleheader games on the same weekend due to the early 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time kickoff of the Falcons-Lions game, in addition to the regional games scheduled in the normal 1:00 p.m. Eastern \\"early\\" slot. In 2015 and 2016 Fox aired an NFL tripleheader (9:30 a.m., 1:00 p.m., and 4:25 p.m. ET) followed by Game 5 of 2015/2016 World Series at 8:00 p.m. ET. =Canadian Football League= The television rightsholders to the Canadian Football League (currently, TSN) have periodically aired doubleheaders and tripleheaders, usually on Saturdays and Sundays. Two Monday doubleheaders, the Labour Day Classic and the Thanksgiving Day Classic, are among the most prominent games in the schedule and occur on two national holidays. The Labour Day Classic doubleheader features prominent rivalries (Hamilton-Toronto and Edmonton-Calgary), while the Thanksgiving Day Classic are otherwise rotated (although one is hosted by the Montreal Alouettes every year). Doubleheaders are also used to present the division semifinal and division final weeks of the CFL playoffs. Association football =Premier League= In the United Kingdom, Sky Sports airs doubleheader matches from the English Premier League under the banner \\"Super Sunday\\". These feature an early match with a kickoff scheduled at 2 p.m. and a late match with a 4:30 p.m. kickoff. Other matches may also be moved to Sunday, usually because one of the teams involved played in a UEFA Europa League fixture the preceding Thursday. This results in Sky Sports airing the early match with a kickoff scheduled at 2:15 p.m. and a late match with a 4:30 p.m. kick-off. =Liga MX= Mexican broadcaster Canal de las Estrellas usually airs a doubleheader on select Sundays during football season. The first game, usually a Deportivo Toluca F.C. or Pumas UNAM home game, begins at 12:00 p.m. Central Time (1:00 p.m. Eastern and 10:00 a.m. Pacific). The second game, typically a Club Am√©rica home game, begins at 4:00 p.m. Central Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern/2:00 p.m. Pacific). Doubleheaders usually air when Club Am√©rica and either Pumas UNAM or Deportivo Toluca F.C. are playing at their home stadium. In the United States, Univision began airing these doubleheaders in 2012. Australian rules football =Australian Football League= In Australia, Fox Footy and Seven Network airs doubleheader matches from the Australian Football League and AFL Women's under the banner \\"Super Sunday\\". These feature an early match with a kickoff scheduled at 1:30 p.m. and a late match with a 4:00 p.m. kickoff. National Hockey League In Canada, Hockey Night in Canada features a doubleheader on CBC on Saturday nights during the National Hockey League (NHL) regular season. The first game, featuring teams based in Eastern Canada, begins at 7:00 p.m. Eastern (4:00 p.m. Pacific Time). The second game, featuring teams based in Western Canada, airs at 10:00 p.m. Eastern (7:00 p.m. Pacific). On some Wednesday nights, Sportsnet may air a doubleheader. In the United States, NBCSN also airs doubleheaders as part of its NHL coverage, usually on Monday nights, in the same time slots. During the 2010‚Äì11 NHL season, NBC debuted \\"Hockey Day in America\\", a televised doubleheader featuring regional games between six of the most popular hockey teams in the U.S. in the opening midday game and a nationally televised game between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Chicago Blackhawks in the afternoon. Completing a tripleheader would be the 2011 Heritage Classic, which aired instead on Versus (now NBCSN). National Basketball Association The NBA currently holds two doubleheaders on Christmas afternoon (counting all broadcast outlets, it has since expanded into a quintupleheader or five consecutive national games). The league also frequently features doubleheaders on ESPN, TNT, and late in the season but less on a frequent basis, ABC. The league experimented in 2009 and 2010 with a Thanksgiving night doubleheader, but discontinued the practice after the 2011 NBA lockout.

The film features Vijay, Suriya, Simran and Kausalya in lead roles. Raghuvaran, Shanthi Krishna, Baby Jennifer, Karan, Vivek, Manivannan and Prakash Raj form the ensemble cast, while Deva and K. V. Anand handled the film's soundtrack and cinematography respectively. It was dubbed into Telugu as Mukha Mukhi. Plot The story starts off with Raghu (Raghuvaran), a passport-issuing officer, and his wife Shanthi (Shanthi Krishna), who live in Chennai. Raghu, being an honest man, tells Shanthi that he cheated on her with a coworker when he was in Goa. She immediately leaves for her mother's house. Raghu, being a transformed gentleman, tries to stop her by apologizing, but in vain. Raghu's brother Vijay (Vijay), being a good and supportive brother, and Shanthi's brother Suriya (Suriya), being a non-emotive but supporting brother, meet in a cinema theater. Vijay, being a righteous brother, blames Shanthi to be the cause of the problem, and Suriya blames Raghu for the same. They keep on fighting at every chance. Meanwhile, both Vijay and Suriya find their own girlfriends in Akhila (Kausalya) and Asha (Simran) respectively and fall in love. One day, Raghu finds a bundle of cash on his table and meets Muthukumaraswamy (Karan), the person who kept the money there. Raghu finds out that Muthukumaraswamy is an MLA who is wanted by the police. Muthukumaraswamy wants to leave the country to escape from the police, and he needs a fake passport to flee the country; otherwise, the police will catch him. Since his passport is confiscated by the police, he tells Raghu to get one for him, but Raghu, being a sincere officer, disagrees and calls the police instead. Muthukumaraswamy gets angry and promises to avenge Raghu. Meanwhile, Raghu and Shanthi apply for a divorce according to the Hindu Law of Divorce. Child custody of their daughter Sona (Jennifer), who was in Shanthi's sister's house when the breakup occurred, is given to the mother by the court. One day, Suriya takes Sona to a fair and somehow loses her. In the confusion that follows, Sona falls from a Ferris wheel and is taken to the hospital by Vijay. She is brought to Raghu's house once she recovers. Soon, Vijay discovers that Sona has lost her hearing in the accident. Some days later, Suriya finds that Sona is missing. Suriya finds Vijay, and the two get into a huge punch fight. Then, Raghu tells everyone that Sona is in his sister's house. Since Sona's custody is given to the mother, this action of Raghu's is wrong in the eyes of law. Shanthi and Suriya, accompanied by a lawyer, come to Raghu's house to get Sona back. At that time, Raghu suffers a serious asthma attack while in the bathroom, and everyone saves him. After recovering, Raghu tells that Sona is not in his sister's house but has been kidnapped by Muthukumaraswamy, who is out on bail. In the turn of events, Raghu issues a fake passport to Muthukumaraswamy, but he does not want him to escape from the police. The two heroes join hands and make sure that this does not happen. They save Sona, who is with Muthukumaraswamy's wife and brother-in-law Kachiram (Ajay Rathnam) in a van. Finally, Kanthaswamy (Prakash Raj), the Chennai Deputy Commissioner of Police, arrests Muthukumaraswamy. The movie ends with Vijay and Suriya becoming best friends again after a long time and reconciling with their lady loves, and Raghu and Shanthi also embrace each other with Sona.

The film was briefly reported to be titled Manasukkul Varalaama? (Can I Come into your Heart?) and also featured Swathi in the cast. Prabhu Deva was touted as a potential replacement to Ajith, though Vasanth then opted to replace Ajith with a debutant as he was able to commit under short notice. Vasanth then approached Suriya, son of veteran actor Sivakumar, to make his acting debut in the film. Vasanth had earlier unsuccessfully tried to persuade Suriya to star in his previous film, Aasai, in 1995 but the actor's father insisted that Suriya was finally ready to act. During the test shoot for the film, cinematographer K. V. Anand revealed that the team were worried how Suriya was going to stand opposite Vijay and that they made him wear two inch heels and made him put some shoulder pads. He added that for the first four days during the shoot in Kolkata, Suriya appeared to be uncomfortable in front of the camera and used to tell the team that he didn't want to do the film. The film was the first Tamil project signed by Simran who was signed by Vasanth after he was impressed with her looks in Tere Mere Sapne, though Once More and VIP released earlier. Vasanth signed on Kausalya after seeing and being impressed with her picture at a jewellery shop and was unaware that she had already made her debut in the hit film Kaalamellam Kadhal Vaazhga. The director revealed he had great difficulty in filming the song \\"Engengae\\", as crowds in Kolkata refused to co-operate with the technical team. The filming mainly took place in and around Trivandrum and Kochi, with some minority portions being shot in Chennai. Reception The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Ganesh Ramachandran, reviewer from Indolink praised the director for non-violent theme and applauding Raghuvaran, Vivek and Manivannan's acting, which provide comedy relief. The music director Deva was appreciated for his \\"haunting numbers\\". On the other hand, the picturisation of the songs were criticized heavily. Karan Bali, writing for Upperstall, applauded the technical aspect of the film, K. V. Anand's cinematography, the script and Deva's music. Performance wise, Raghuvaran and Shanthi Krishna were said to be \\"reliably efficient as the brother and sister of Vijay and Suriya respectively\\", while the critic labelled the performance of Suriya as a \\"terribly awkward debut\\". The song \\"Manam Virumbuthey\\" was described as the best song in the film for its picturisation and choreography. The film went on to win two Tamil Nadu State Film Awards for 1997 with the child artiste, Jennifer, securing the Best Child Star award for her performance. Harini also won the Best Female Playback Singer award for her rendition of \\"Manam Virumbuthae\\" in the album aged just 18. Soundtrack The soundtrack consists of 6 songs, composed by Deva. All lyrics written by Vairamuthu. The song \\"Akila Akila\\" is based on Bob Marley's \\"Buffalo Soldier\\".

The battalion recruited in Alberta and was mobilized at Calgary. The battalion was authorized on 7 November 1914 and embarked for Britain on 17 May 1915. On 18 September 1915 it disembarked in France, where it fought with the 6th Infantry Brigade, 2nd Canadian Division in France and Flanders until the end of the war. The battalion was disbanded on 30 August 1920. The battalion commander until late in the war was Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Henry Bell of Calgary. On 17 May 1915, the battalion sailed for England on , with a complement of 36 officers and 1033 other ranks. After initial training in England, the battalion fought in Belgium and France, and was often at the forefront of the fighting at St. Eloi Craters, the Ypres Salient, Vimy Ridge (Th√©lus Village), Fresnoy, Somme, Second Battle of Passchendaele, the Battle of Amiens (1918), the Battle of Arras (1917), Battle of Drocourt-Qu√©ant Line, Valenciennes, Mons, and the occupation of the Rhineland. The battalion captured a Siberian pony from the Germans, which apparently had been captured from the Russians earlier in the war. The Canadians named this pony Heinie, and it became the 31st Battalion's mascot. After the war the 31st brought Heinie to Alberta, where it worked until at least the late 1920s for the Dominion Parks Branch near Banff, Alberta. The bulk of the battalion returned to Canada on SS Cedric on 27 May 1919, and to Calgary on 1 June 1919. Through the course of the First World War, the 31st Battalion suffered losses of 941 dead, and an additional 2,312 non-fatal casualties. A total of 4,487 men served in the battalion.

In investigations of these reactions in people with substance use disorders, changes in self-reported drug craving, physiological responses, and drug use are monitored as they are exposed to drug-related cues (e.g., cigarettes, bottles of alcohol, drug paraphernalia) or drug-neutral cues (e.g., pencils, glasses of water, a set of car keys). Scientific findings A meta-analysis of 41 cue reactivity studies with people that have an alcohol, heroin, or cocaine addiction strongly supports the finding that people who have addictions have significant cue-specific reactions to drug-related stimuli. In general, these individuals, regardless of drug of abuse, report robust increases in craving and exhibit modest changes in autonomic responses, such as increases in heart rate and skin conductance and decreases in skin temperature, when exposed to drug-related versus neutral stimuli. Surprisingly, despite their obvious clinical relevance, drug use or drug- seeking behaviors are seldom measured in cue reactivity studies. However, when drug-use measures are used in cue reactivity studies the typical finding is a modest increase in drug-seeking or drug-use behavior. Development Clinical implications Since people with substance use disorders are highly reactive to environmental cues previously associated with drug use, a common treatment strategy is to advise them to avoid people and situations formerly associated with drug use. For example, a person attempting to quit smoking should avoid other people who smoke and places where smoking is prevalent (like bars in places where smoking is allowed in bars). Although the relationship between cue reactivity in the laboratory and relapse to drug use in the real world is still poorly understood, considerable anecdotal evidence from drug treatment programs and smoking cessation counselors suggests that people with substance use disorders who seek treatment are more successful at remaining abstinent if they take special care to avoid cues associated with prior drug use.

Barry Butler (30 July 1934 ‚Äì 9 April 1966) was a professional footballer who spent most of his career at Norwich City. He is remembered by his teammates and supporters as an inspirational captain and outstanding defensive player. Butler, who played for Norwich until his death in a car crash in 1966, was often referred to as one of the best defenders in the league by opponents and is regarded as one of Norwich's greatest ever players. Butler also played for Sheffield Wednesday. Early life Butler was educated at Richard Hind secondary school in his hometown of Stockton. Whilst there he captained both the football and cricket teams. Upon leaving school Butler took a job as an apprentice electrical fitter at ICI in nearby Billingham where he played in the works football team. He played for various minor clubs whilst at ICI including Northern League side South Bank. Sheffield Wednesday Butler joined Sheffield Wednesday as a teenager in September 1952 with the Hillsborough club paying South Bank ¬£300 for his services. After working his way up the ranks in the \\"A\\" team and reserves he finally made his first team debut for the Owls on 2 January 1954 at the age of 19. Butler replaced the injured Cyril Turton in a Division One game at home to Burnley; the game finished as a 2‚Äì0 win for Wednesday. The match would be the start of a 19 consecutive game run in the first team for Butler, a sequence that ended in the 4‚Äì1 loss at home to Huddersfield Town on 3 April. The run included eight FA Cup games as the Owls reached the semi-finals, eventually being beaten 2‚Äì0 by Preston North End at Maine Road. He made several appearances the following season, but the increased competition caused by the signing of Don McEvoy in December 1954 spelled the end of his Wednesday career. Butler played just three more games in a Wednesday shirt ‚Äì the final one as a centre-forward ‚Äì before he was relegated to the reserves for the remaining two years of his time at Hillsborough. He played a total of 36 games for the club, scoring once in the 2‚Äì1 loss away to Blackpool on 19 February 1955. Norwich Norwich manager Archie Macaulay paid Sheffield Wednesday a transfer fee of ¬£5,000 for Butler in August 1957, just after he had finished his service in the RAF. He immediately made an impression and established himself as an essential member of the side. In the 1958‚Äì59 season, he was a member of the Norwich team that embarked on one of the most famous FA Cup runs of all time. A third division side at the time, they reached the semi-finals (defeating, among others, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United along the way) and narrowly lost the semi-final in a replay at St Andrews against Luton. The following season, Butler played in every match of the campaign as City won promotion to Division Two of the Football League. Two years later, he was a key member of the Norwich team that won the Football League Cup for the first time, as they beat Rochdale 4‚Äì0 in a two-legged final. At the time Butler was considered to be the best un-capped centre-half in the country. In 1963, Butler was appointed team captain when Ron Ashman relinquished his playing duties to take up the job of managing the team on a permanent basis. Around the same time he earned his FA coaching badge, and later he was awarded the role of player-coach for the 1966‚Äì67 season. He played a total of 349 matches for the club including a consecutive run of 208 games which was only broken because of his appearance in an FA XI side. Death Tragically Butler would never take up his position as player-coach. On 9 April 1966, Butler was killed in a car crash at the age of 31, his car having collided with a bus late at night. His funeral was held at St Peter Mancroft church in Norwich. Legacy The year after his death, the Norwich City player of the year award was named The Barry Butler Memorial Trophy in his honour and has been voted for by the supporters every year since then. In 2002, when the club held an on-pitch reunion of former players prior to a match against Harwich & Parkestone to mark the club's centenary, Butler's widow attended to represent him. His son David attended a Hall of Fame dinner at Norwich City Football Club in January 2004. Butler's teammate Bill Punton described him as \\"...probably the best centre-half who has ever played for the club...On the field he was a leader, a real leader. He was the man who kept the team going all the time.\\"http://www.edp24.co.uk/sport/norwich-city/ncfc- top-100-appearances-barry-butler-17-1-5071888 References *Canary Citizens by Mark Davage, John Eastwood, Kevin Platt, published by Jarrold Publishing, (2001), 1934 births 1966 deaths Sportspeople from Stockton-on-Tees Footballers from County Durham English footballers Association football defenders South Bank F.C. players Norwich City F.C. players Sheffield Wednesday F.C. players Northern Football League players English Football League players Road incident deaths in England Deaths in East of England ","title":"Barry Butler (footballer, born 1934)"},{"id":"5760800","text":"Yaoi Press is an independent yaoi comic publisher based in Nevada.

Function  A sweep account combines two or more accounts at a bank or a financial institution, moving funds between them in a predetermined manner. Sweep accounts are useful in managing a steady cash flow between a cash account used to make scheduled payments, and an investment account where the cash is able to accrue a higher return. Many banks and financial institutions offer a sweep account service for personal customers and small business owners. It has also become part of the arsenal of services offered by credit card companies.  Mechanics  In banking, sweep accounts are primarily used as a legal workaround to the prohibition on paying interest on business checking accounts. In this system, the funds are described as being \\"swept overnight\\" into an investment vehicle of some kind. The choices for sweep investments are often the following: money funds, and what are known as \\"Eurodollar Sweeps\\" or \\"Repo Sweeps\\". Eurodollar sweeps are legal transfers of funds to the bank's offshore entities, although essentially they are just an accounting technique to allow the banks to have full lending of the funds without the reserve requirements normally required and without having to pay for FDIC insurance (as the sweep is uninsured). Essentially, the funds are just unsecured obligations of the bank, and therefore are paid the highest interest rate offered by the bank to overnight deposit borrowings. \\"Repo Sweeps\\" (\\"repo\\" meaning \\"repurchase agreement\\") are for companies that are concerned about the safety of the bank (usually by mandate of the companies/institutions charter and not due to the opinions of the employees or financial staff). In this arrangement, the swept funds on deposit with the bank are secured by some of the bond holdings of the bank. If the bank were to fail, the depositor would just be given the bond holdings and then could sell the bonds to get their money back (unless something happens to the bond prices in the interim). Larger corporate bank accounts are charged numerous fees for each of the services the bank offers (such as a charge per every check deposited), however the bank rebates these fees based on the companies account balances in a process known as account analysis. =How it actually works= In a sweep account #A cash account is set up first and a lump sum of money is deposited into that account. #A financial advisor and the client will discuss and determine an average balance that should be kept in this account. Depending on the institution's service, this amount may be pre-determined. #Most of the extra cash above the average balance will be invested into a money market, CD, or some other form of investment that can be easily liquidated. #When the balance in the cash account falls below the pre- determined average balance, some of the investment is liquidated and the proceeds get deposited into the cash account, thus maintaining the average balance. If the initial calculations are done correctly, the interest on the cash and returns on the investments should yield a large enough return that will increase the total value of the sweep account. During a bad economic cycle, the funds in the investment accounts may fall low enough that substantial gains will not be possible to maintain the average balance in the cash account. In these cases, the financial institutions would ask either for more funds to be put into the investment account, or recommend other forms of investments and liquidation. The financial innovation of sweep accounts is particularly interesting because it was stimulated not only by the desire to avoid costly regulation, but also by a change in supply conditions ‚Äî in this case technology.  Company policy issues  Some companies choose to have all of their funds swept into a sweep account if they believe that the increased earnings will more than offset the fees they would have been rebated, should they have left the funds in the account. Other companies calculate the approximate amount needed to rebate the fees and then only sweep funds in excess of that amount. Companies pay extra for more complex investment strategies, and for more detailed communication from their bank. For example, knowing when the checks they issue will probably clear, enables them to more precisely determine how to invest and for how long. This service is known controlled disbursement.

The performances were recorded perhaps as early as the 1970s, either in the province of Burgos or in Madrid, the Spanish capital. The music did not sell significantly until it was re- released by Angel in 1994 when it was strongly marketed as an antidote to the stress of modern life. Chant is the best-selling album of Gregorian chant ever released. It peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 music chart, and was certified as double platinum, meaning two million copies were sold in the United States. Worldwide, the album sold around six million copies. Performers The monks of Santo Domingo de Silos have been singing Gregorian chant since the 11th century (before that, they used Mozarabic chant). There was a break in the tradition in the 1830s when the abbey was closed by the government as part of the so-called Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendiz√°bal. The abbey was reestablished with the help of monks from Solesmes Abbey in France.Alston, George Cyprian. \\"Abbey of St. Solesmes\\". The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 23 March 2015 Solesmes is known for its commitment to plainsong and the Solesmes style of singing has influenced the monks of Santo Domingo de Silos, although the monks' pronunciation of Latin reflects their Spanish background. Sources agree that the music had been recorded some years before it achieved worldwide fame. However, the exact dates appear to be elusive. According to the records posted on the Gregorian Association site, Chant consists of recordings made 1972-1982.Monks of S. Domingo de Silos, The Gregorian Association Blair Sanderson suggests that a seminary in the Spanish city of Logro√±o invited the monks to record a vinyl album of chant in order to popularize it among churchgoers, and that most of the music was recorded around 1980, while there is a greater proportion of music recorded in the 1970s in the follow-up album Chant II. Reception Reviewers expressed surprise at the commercial success of the album, although there had previously been popular interest in Gregorian chants as a consequence of the success of the project Enigma in 1990/91, specifically the single \\"Sadeness (Part I)\\". Not only had Gregorian chant been a specialist market for record companies before the 1980s, but also other monastic choirs, such as that of Solesmes Abbey, had enjoyed a higher profile as recording artists than the Silos monks.Selective Chant Discography, The Gregorian Association (London, England) The monks normally follow a routine based on their monastic duties. However, following the commercial success of Chant they made publicity appearances and were interviewed on The Tonight Show and Good Morning America. Sequel albums Chant No√´l: Chants For The Holiday Season was released 1 November 1994, Chant No√´l at Amazon.com with Chant II released 17 October 1995 Chant II at Amazon.com and Chant III on 17 September 1996. Chant III at Amazon.com In 1998, Chant was reissued as a gold-audiophile CD by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab. In 2004, it was re-issued along with its follow-up, Chant II as Chant: The Anniversary Edition by Angel/EMI Classics. The album was spoofed by members of the comedy rock band Big Daddy, performing as the Benzedrine Monks of Santa Domonica, in their album Chantmania, Chantmania at Amazon.com which included Gregorian-inspired versions of notable pop songs.

For many years Bede Island South was a run down area of brownfield land home to Vic Berry's locomotive scrapyard but in the 1990s urban regeneration sought to improve housing, employment opportunities and the environment in the area. The programme was successful in developing the waterfront of Leicester, a key part of the overall transformation of the city. Local streets are named after herbs and spices, these are Sage Road, Tarragon Road, Coriander Road, Mint Road and Thyme Close (these names resulted from the children at Hazel Street infants and juniors School being asked about names for the new housing development - they asked for them to be named after the pop group The Spice Girls but the Council deemed that was not appropriate and a compromise of the current names was the outcome!).

Mouse controls are disabled by default, although add- ons such as an on-screen crosshair or mouse control can be enabled in the game's menu. Reviews Stephen Poole on CNET's Reviews section rates Terracide 3/5 as \\"Good\\", with its major flaws commented that Terracide is \\"an unabashed Descent clone coupled with a tired \\"save the earth from destruction by alien invaders\\" story\\", and its biggest issue was the control in which \\"it was almost impossible to line up shots on a consistent basis because the ship wouldn't stop turning when I wanted it to\\".

Secrets From the Masters, p.267. . Whereas the seven modes are all derived from the same scale and therefore can coincide with each other (i.e. B Locrian, A Aeolian, and D Dorian all coming to be the notes of the C Major Scale), synthetic modes work differently. Symmetric diminished and inverse symmetric diminished scales These two modes, which are mirror image to each other and are also transpositions of each other, are created by dividing the octave into four equal parts and adding an interval of either half a step or a whole step to each resulting note. As such, they are both symmetric scales and are used in diminished context, albeit in a different manner. They are also the result of superimposing two diminished seventh chords set either half a step or a whole step from each other. The symmetric diminished scale, also known as \\"half- whole\\", goes as follows: :1 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 It can be applied to a dominant chord, the root of which can be equally transposed to any note of the diminished seventh chord built on the root. For example, this scale starting on C (C D D E F G A B) can be applied to either C7, A7, F7 or E7. The inverse symmetric diminished scale, also known as \\"whole-half\\", goes as follows: :1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ()7 This scale is used as the chord scale for the diminished seventh chord. Naturally, as the diminished seventh chord is symmetric and therefore, sounds the same when started from either note, the same goes for the scale. For example, this scale starting on C (C D E F G A B B()) can be applied to C7, which in turn is enharmonically equivalent to A7, F7 or E7. Note that the diminished chord is always tense and its seventh is double flattened (7); therefore, only in diminished context can a 6 (or 13) be played simultaneously with what is the enharmonic equivalent of a 6 (voiced only a major seventh above it or a minor second below it, the latter being only valid in piano voicings, but never a minor ninth below it). It is also the only context where the major seventh is considered a tension, rather than a chord tone. Similarly, only in Dorian/Mixolydian context can a 6 (or 13) be played simultaneously with what is the enharmonic equivalent of an augmented 6th (voiced only a major seventh above it or a minor second below it, the latter being only valid in piano voicings, but never a minor ninth below it). Also, only in Aeolian/Phrygian context can a 6 (or 13) be played simultaneously with the 5 (voiced only a major seventh above it or a minor second below it, the latter being only valid in piano voicings, but never a minor ninth below it). Hexatonic scales Those are six-note scales, which are usually created by superimposing two mutually exclusive triads. Hexatonic scales often function as the solution to having a common scale to improvise while cycling through unusual chord progressions or hybrid chords. Example: the three-tonic cycle normally requires changing \\"key notes\\" to emphasize each modulation. If we look for one scale that can fit all the chords, the first logical thing to do is to try and combine the triad notes of all tonics. Suppose we start the cycle with C major, our pitches will be: C E G, E G B, and A[G] C E[D]. These notes form the following scale: C D E G A B (C) Essentially, these are C augmented and B augmented triads superimposed over each other. Such structuring, as always, produces a symmetric scale.

She agreed to pay ¬£5 to a Mrs Hewetson (Ada Chard Williams) but could only give her ¬£3 on the day. She went back later with the balance and found that Mrs Hewetson and Selina had vanished. Florence reported the matter to the police. Ada Chard Williams wrote a letter to the police denying the crime but in effect admitting she was a baby farmer who bought and sold babies for profit. The police soon discovered that Mrs Hewetson was Ada Chard Williams. However, they had no body with which to prove there had been a murder, at least not until Selina's corpse was washed up on the bank of the Thames at Battersea. Braxton Hicks, the coroner who carried out the subsequent inquest, pointed out that the knots in the cord, a \\"fisherman's bend\\", had been found on three other dead bodies of children. On the child's head there was a very large bruise, which suggested that someone had taken the child by the legs, and struck it against a wall before it was strangled. Like Amelia Dyer, Ada Chard Williams had her own \\"signature\\" way of tying up bodies she wished to dispose of, using a knot called a Fisherman's knot or bend and which was a crucial piece of evidence at her trial at the Old Bailey on 16 and 17 February 1900. She was hanged, aged 24, in the yard of Newgate Prison on 6 March 1900, the last woman to be hanged there. She was suspected of killing other children although no proceedings were brought.

She is to date the only female player from Ireland to ever win a singles title at Wimbledon.  Biography  Lena Rice was born the second-youngest of the eight children of Spring Rice and Anna Gorde in 1866. Her family lived in a two-storied Georgian building at Marlhill, half a mile from New Inn, County Tipperary. When her father died in 1868, her mother struggled to manage the household. Lena learned to play tennis with her sister Anne in their large garden at Marlhill, and both girls entered the Cahir Lawn Tennis club. Rice's first tournament outside County Tipperary were the Irish Championships at Dublin in May 1889. There she lost in straight sets to Blanche Bingley Hillyard in the semifinals. In doubles competition, she reached the final partnering Hillyard, and in mixed doubles she won the title along with Willoughby Hamilton. Later that year, Rice played at the Wimbledon Championships. She reached the final where she met Hillyard once again. She won the first set 6‚Äì4 and had three match points at 5‚Äì3, 40‚Äì15 and advantage in the second, but Hillyard managed to come back and eventually won 4‚Äì6, 8‚Äì6, 6‚Äì4. The next year, only four players participated at the singles event at Wimbledon. After winning over Mary Steedman in two sets in the first round, her opponent in the All-comers' final was May Jacks. Rice won 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì1 and as defending champion Blanche Hillyard was pregnant and did not enter the tournament, Rice won the title, the 50-guineas challenger trophy and a cash prize of 20 guineas. She is credited with inventing the Overhead Smash, employing it in her match-winning point against May Jacks in that 1890 final. After her 1890 Wimbledon title, there is no record of Rice playing tennis at a tournament. She did not defend her Wimbledon title in the challenge round the following year. As her mother died in 1891, it seems likely that family ill health prevented her from continuing her tennis career. Rice, who never married, died of tuberculosis on her 41st birthday in 1907. She was buried at the New Inn cemetery, close to her parents, her brother Samel and her sister Agnes.

The culture of Puerto Rico is the result of a number of international and indigenous influences, both past and present. Modern cultural manifestations showcase the island's rich history and help to create an identity which is a melting pot of cultures - Ta√≠no (Aboriginal/First Nation/Indigenous), European (Spanish, Canary Island, Corsican and Irish), African (West African), Anglo American (U.S.A.), Latin American/Caribbean Asian, Hawaiian and other influences.Puerto Rico Convention Center. \\"Puerto Rico: Culture\\". About Puerto Rico. Influences =Ta√≠no= Statue in Old San Juan, photographed by Carol M. Highsmith A subgroup of the Arawakan aboriginals (a group of Native Americans in northeastern South America), inhabited the Greater Antilles (comprising Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and the Dominican Republic). The Ta√≠no culture impressed both the Spanish Europeans (who observed it) and modern sociologists. The Arawakan achievements included construction of ceremonial ball parks whose boundaries were marked by upright stone dolmens, development of a universal language, and creation of a complicated religious cosmology. There was a hierarchy of deities who inhabited the sky; Yocahu was the supreme Creator. Another god, Jurak√°n, was perpetually angry and ruled the power of the hurricane. Other mythological figures were the gods Zemi and Maboya. The zemis, a god of both sexes, were represented by icons in the form of human and animal figures, and collars made of wood, stone, bones, and human remains. Ta√≠no Indians believed that being in the good graces of their zemis protected them from disease, hurricanes, or disaster in war. They therefore served cassava (manioc) bread as well as beverages and tobacco to their zemis as propitiatory offerings. Maboyas, on the other hand, was a nocturnal deity who destroyed the crops and was feared by all the natives, to the extent that elaborate sacrifices were offered to placate him. Myths and traditions were perpetuated through ceremonial dances (areytos), drumbeats, oral traditions, and a ceremonial ball game played between opposing teams (of 10 to 30 players per team) with a rubber ball; winning this game was thought to bring a good harvest and strong, healthy children. The Ta√≠no aboriginals lived in theocratic kingdoms and had a hierarchically arranged chiefs, or caciques. The Ta√≠nos were divided in three social classes: the (work class), the or sub- chiefs and noblemen which includes the or priests and medicine men and the caciques or chiefs, each village or yucayeque had one. At the time Juan Ponce de Le√≥n took possession of the Island, there were about twenty villages, or yucayeque. Cacique Ag√ºeybana was chief of the Ta√≠nos. He lived at Gu√°nica, the largest Indian village in the island, on the Guayanilla River. The rank of each was apparently established along democratic lines; his importance in the tribe was determined by the size of his clan, rather than its war-making strength. There was no aristocracy of lineage, nor were their titles other than those given to individuals to distinguish their services to the clan. Their complexion were bronze-colored, average stature, dark, flowing, coarse hair, and large and slightly slanted dark eyes. Men generally went naked or wore a breech cloth, called , while single women went naked and married women wore an to cover their genitals, made of cotton or palm fibers, the length of which was a sign of rank. Both sexes painted themselves on special occasions; they wore earrings, nose rings, and necklaces, which were sometimes made of gold. Ta√≠no crafts were few; some pottery and baskets were made, and stone, marble and wood were worked skillfully. Skilled at agriculture and hunting, then Ta√≠nos were also good sailors, fishermen, canoe makers, and navigators. Their main crops were cassava, garlic, potatoes, yaut√≠as, mamey, guava, and an√≥n. They had no calendar or writing system. Their personal possessions consisted of wooden stools with four legs and carved backs, hammocks made of cotton cloth or string for sleeping, clay and wooden bowls for mixing and serving food, calabashes or gourds for drinking water and bailing out boats, and their most prized possessions, large dugout canoes, for transportation, fishing, and water sports. Caciques lived in rectangular huts, called caneyes, located in the center of the village facing the batey. The lived in round huts, called . The construction of both types of building was the same: wooden frames, topped by straw, with earthen floor, and scant interior furnishing. But the buildings were strong enough to resist hurricanes. It is believed that Ta√≠no settlements ranged from single families to groups of 3,000 people. About 100 years before the Spanish invasion, the Ta√≠nos were challenged by an invading South American tribe - the Caribs [Glos.]. Fierce, warlike, sadistic, and adept at using poison-tipped arrows, they raided Ta√≠no settlements for slaves (especially females) and bodies for the completion of their rites of cannibalism. Some ethnologists argue that the preeminence of the Ta√≠nos, shaken by the attacks of the Caribs, was already jeopardized by the time of the Spanish occupation. In fact, it was Caribs who fought the most effectively against the Europeans, their behavior probably led the Europeans to unfairly attribute warlike tendencies to all of the island's tribes. A dynamic tension between the Ta√≠nos and the Caribs certainly existed when the Christopher Columbus landed on Puerto Rico. When the Spanish European settlers first came in 1508, since there is no reliable documentation, anthropologists estimate their numbers to have been between 20,000 and 50,000, but maltreatment, disease, flight, and unsuccessful rebellion had diminished their number to 4,000 by 1515; in 1544 a bishop counted only 60, but these too were soon lost. At their arrival the Spaniards expected the Ta√≠no Indians to acknowledge the sovereignty of the king of Spain by payment of gold tribute, to work and supply provisions of food and to observe Christian ways. The Ta√≠nos rebelled most notably in 1511, when several caciques (Indian leaders) conspired to oust the Spaniards. They were joined in this uprising by their traditional enemies, the Caribs. Their weapons, however, were no match against Spanish horses and firearms and the revolt was soon ended brutally by the Spanish forces of Governor Juan Ponce de Le√≥n. As a result, Ta√≠no culture, language, and traditions were generally decimated, and were claimed to have \\"vanished\\" 50 years after Christopher Columbus arrived. Since the early 21st century, efforts have been made to revive and rebuild Ta√≠no culture. In order to understand Puerto Rico's prehistoric era, it is important to know that the Ta√≠nos, far more than the Caribs, contributed greatly to the everyday life and language that evolved during the Spanish occupation. Ta√≠no place names are still used for such towns as Utuado, Mayag√ºez, Caguas, and Humacao, among others. Many Ta√≠no implements and techniques were copied directly by the Europeans, including the (straw hut) and the hamaca (hammock), the musical instrument known as the maracas, and the method of making cassava bread. Many Taino words persist in the Puerto Rican vocabulary of today. Names of plants, trees and fruits includes: man√≠, leren, aj√≠, yuca, mamey, pajuil, pitajaya, cupey, tabonuco and ceiba. Names of fish, animals and birds include: . As well as other objects and instruments: and . Other words were passed not only into Spanish, but also into English, such as huracan (hurricane) and hamaca (hammock). Also, many Ta√≠no superstitions and legends were adopted and adapted by the Spanish and still influence the Puerto Rican imagination. ‚Ä¢The Indigenous People of the Caribbean ‚Ä¢In Defense of the Indians : The Defense of the Most Reverend Lord, Don Fray Bartolome de las Casas, of the Order of Preachers, Late Bishop of Chiapas ‚Ä¢The Tainos: Rise & Decline of the People Who Greeted Columbus Other resources ‚Ä¢Arawaks ‚Ä¢Cacicazgos del Siglo 16 ‚Ä¢Caciques, Nobles, and their Regalia ‚Ä¢Indigenous Puerto Rico: DNA evidence upsets established history ‚Ä¢The Jatibonicu Taino Tribal Nation ‚Ä¢The New Old World - Antilles: Living Beyond the Myth. ‚Ä¢Tainos =Europe= The most profound European influence is that of Spain, the island's colonizer. Spanish influence is the most notable of all cultural influences in Puerto Rican culture. Spanish heritage has left an indelible mark on the island, and signs of this cultural exchange can be found everywhere, from the Colonial architecture and official language to the island's literature and local culinary styles. As far back as the 16th century, the Spanish built a series of massive defense structures to protect Old San Juan and its bay from other invaders. Parts of Old San Juan and La Fortaleza are now UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The culture of European countries has also influenced the development of the performing arts on the island, especially in music. Many of the island's musical genres have their origins in the Spanish culture, which is responsible for such genres of music as decima, seis, danza, mambo, etc. Rooster fighting is a blood sport that has been part of the Puerto Rican culture for centuries. In 1845, Manuel Alonso, in his book , wrote that maybe a could lack a church, but no barrio of Puerto Rico lacked a cockfighting venue. The sport was passed in families, from generation to generation. There are 71 official venues and hundreds of thousands of people attend events each year.https://www.podbean.com/ew/pb-kg37s-cbdd36 In Daddy Yankee's video for a cockfight can be seen. =Africa= With the introduction of slavery to the colony, the island experienced an influx of Africans who brought with them the cultural influences of their own tribes. These influences are evident in the fields of dance and music, such as la bomba, la plena, and most recently in , which is an Afro-Caribbean based Puerto Rican genre, as well as influences in Puerto Rican Spanish, and Puerto Rican cuisine. The presence of African diasporic religions, such as Santeria, is due to African influence. More subtle ties also exist, such as those that connect Puerto Rico's literary history with the rich African tradition of oral storytelling. Also, all Afro- Caribbean, Afro-Latino, and African American cultural influences from the United States, neighboring Caribbean islands, and Puerto Rico itself, are largely African in origin. =The Caribbean and Latin America= The shared African heritage of many Caribbean nations is reflected in cultural pursuits like dance, as well as in local culinary styles. Most regional influences are Latino and Afro-Caribbean. The neighboring islands that have had the most influence on Puerto Rico's dance and music are Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica. Panama has shared its great passion for Spanish Reggae with Puerto Rico, the Spanish language version of Jamaican Reggae. Eventually , a Puerto Rican break-off of original Spanish reggae, became very popular throughout Latin America, the Caribbean, the US and Spain. Puerto Rican artists helped create Salsa music with Cuban artists, and also helped Dominican artists with the development of Merengue. Recent Haitian and Dominican immigration has been producing many new cultural influences. Significant cultural exchange has been evident between Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, especially the islands of St. Croix, Vieques, and Culebra, such as Puerto Rican style Patois mixed with Spanish. A number of Latin American countries have also exerted influence on Puerto Rico's cultural identity. In the filmmaking community, co-productions between Puerto Rico and other Latin American countries have created an exchange of ideas and influenced their film conventions. For instance, the Latin sense of humor and fantastical elements are evident in Puerto Rican films. =United States= Hurricane Maria US and Puerto Rico flags on a building in Puerto Rico Culturally, Puerto Rican sentiment for the U.S. tends to vary between emulation and opposition, a result of the complicated socio-political relationship between the two. Since establishment as a United States Commonwealth in 1898, traditional economics, social structure, nationalism, and culture has been affected in Puerto Rico.Ayala, Cesar J. and Bernabe, Rafael.

A sugar mill complex in Puerto Rico painted by Francisco Oller in 1885. Brooklyn Museum. Before the United States captured Puerto Rico from Spain in 1898, the colony was agriculture based. Most worked on sugar cane, tobacco, or coffee plantations.Mintz, Sidney W. \\"The People of Puerto Rico Half a Century Later: One Author's Recollections\\" in The Journal of Latin American Anthropology. Vol. 6, Issue 2, p. 76. Through the beginning of the 20th century, Puerto Ricans remained agricultural. Operation Bootstrap, an operation of the United States and the Puerto Rico Economic Development Administration, began in 1942 and was put in place to transform Puerto Rico into an industrial colony. Government owned factories were built to shift development to industrial factory work and, eventually, education of the factory work force.Cook, James. \\"Operation Bootstrap\\" in Forbes. Vol. 150, Issue 4, p. 50. The growth of Puerto Rican industry changed the outlook on familial social structure. Traditionally, the Puerto Rican family was a large, three generation family living in the same home or as neighbors. The family was built around a set of parents or a single mother, and the family was sustained through multiple wage earning jobs. As the industrial revolution progressed, women found factory jobs more easily than men, becoming the bread winners. The Puerto Rican family structure changed to a small, nuclear matriarchy consisting of only immediate family members.Safa, Helen. \\"The Transformation of Puerto Rico: The Impact of Modernization Ideology\\" in Transforming Anthropology. Vol. 19, Number 1, p. 47. The United States ideal of small, patriarchal families also impacted the contemporary Puerto Rican family structure in policy. In an attempt to demolish poverty in shantytowns, the Puerto Rico Housing Authority established public housing by example of United States policy.Safa, Helen. \\"The Transformation of Puerto Rico: The Impact of Modernization Ideology\\" in Transforming Anthropology. Vol. 19, Number 1, p. 46. The public housing further disenfranchised the large multi-generation family by dividing nuclear families into public, single-family dwellings. Links to extended family are still an important aspect to the culture of Puerto Rican family structure, however they have been significantly weakened.Safa, Helen. \\"The Transformation of Puerto Rico: The Impact of Modernization Ideology\\" in Transforming Anthropology. Vol. 19, Number 1, p. 48. The relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico makes national identity complicated. Puerto Ricans maintain United States citizenship while aligning with a uniquely Puerto Rican heritage. Although the island's culture is not heterogeneous, Puerto Rico establishes several binary oppositions to the United States: American identity versus Puerto Rican identity, English language versus Spanish language, Protestant versus Catholic, and Anglo-Saxon heritage versus Hispanic heritage.Dunay, Jorge. \\"Nation on the Move: The Construction of Cultural Identities in Puerto Rico and the Diaspora\\" in American Ethnologist. Vol. 27, Issue 1, p. 10. Another issue splitting national identity is political ideals on Puerto Rico's national status. There are three primary positions: pro- Commonwealth, pro-statehood, and pro-independence. Basically, Puerto Rican identity has been developed in rejection to American cultural identity.Dunay, Jorge. \\"Nation on the Move: The Construction of Cultural Identities in Puerto Rico and the Disapora\\" in American Ethnologist. Vo. 27, Issue 1, p. 12. Since United States citizenship was instated, about half of the pre-Commonwealth population of Puerto Rico has relocated to the continental United States.Falcon, Angelo. \\"The Diaspora Factor: Stateside Boricuas and the Future of Puerto Rico\\" in NACLA Report on the Americas. Vol. 40, Issue 6, p. 40. Those who have relocated to the United States are considered by some not to be a part of the Puerto Rican nation.Dunay, Jorge. \\"Nation on the Move: The Construction of Cultural Identities in Puerto Rico and the Diaspora\\" in American Ethnologist. Vol. 27, Issue 1, p. 22. American influences such as jazz can be found in the development of the island's unique musical style, but there is also evidence of cultural antagonism, particularly in areas such as literature. This dichotomy also exists in cinema, which has been greatly influenced by the U.S. With its commonwealth status, Puerto Rico has always attracted U.S. studios to shoot in the commonwealth, and film genres popular in the States during specific periods were often mirrored in contemporary Puerto Rican productions. However, other films delve into issues springing from the complex relationship between the two countries. Much film produced in Puerto Rico focuses on the complicated national identity of Puerto Ricans.Maldonado-DeOliveria, Debora. \\"Problematic Ideas of Puerto Rico in Puerto Rican Cinema: Luis Molina Casanova's La Guagua Aerea\\" in Centro Journal.

It is able to fight in a defensive role as well as provide the vital logistical support to sustain the operations of the other units within the brigade group. Sub-units Service battalions are normally subdivided into: *a battalion headquarters (Bn HQ), concerned with overseeing the effective training and employment of all companies within the battalion. The HQ usually consists of the command staff, an orderly room, an operations cell, and a training cell. *a transportation company (Tn Coy), which provides transportation and movements support, both tactical and administrative, to the brigade. *a supply company (Sup Coy) which provides general supply support to the brigade. *a maintenance company (Maint Coy), which provides automotive, mechanical, electrical, weapon maintenance and support to the brigade. *an administration company (Admin Coy), which provides internal service support (signals and communication, transportation, supply, maintenance, food services, and military police support) to the battalion and its elements. Flag 12 (Vancouver) Service Battalion Flag The unit flag of a service battalion is steeped with the traditions of its founding corps. The flag is a tri-color with the top and bottom equaling 2/5ths of the height each and the centre equaling 1/5th of the height. The official colours of the unit flag are Oriental blue (top) and Marine Corps Scarlet (bottom) with an intervening gold stripe. Then it has a large white Arabic numeral representing the number of the Service Battalion emblazoned on both sides in the flag's centre. These regal colours have a long history of association with army services. The Oriental blue colour of the flag is reminiscent of the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps (RCOC) flag while the gold colour can be found on the former banners of the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps (RCASC), the Royal Canadian Electrical Mechanical Engineers Corps (RCEME), and the Royal Canadian Army Pay Corps (RCAPC). The Scarlet colour may have some reference to the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps (RCAMC); the Militia Medical Companies were, for a short period in the early 1970s, incorporated into the Service Battalion organizations. More correctly it refers to the Scarlet accoutrements‚Äô on the RCOC and RCEME dress uniforms earned through its close association with the Royal Canadian Artillery in the early 1900s. This flag was designed by Chief Warrant Officer Phil Raven during his time as regimental sergeant major of 2 Service Battalion in the 1970s. Service battalions of the CF The following are the current service battalions in the CF, by brigade: =Regular Force= * 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (1 CMBG), Edmonton, Alberta **1 Service Battalion (1 Svc Bn) * 2 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (2 CMBG), Petawawa, Ontario **2 Service Battalion (2 Svc Bn) * 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (5 CMBG), Valcartier, Quebec **5 Service Battalion (5 CMBG) Historically, 3 Service Battalion was located at CFB Gagetown, New Brunswick, in support of 3 CIBG until disbanded in the early 1970s. 3 Svc Bn served as the \\"Experimental Service Battalion\\" from 1963, when brigade-level combat service support resources were pooled under a single commanding officer and headquarters. This model has served the Canadian Army, albeit with some changes, since being adopted by the other brigades in 1968. Based in the Federal Republic of Germany, 4 Service Battalion was created at CFB Soest in 1968 and moved to CFB Lahr in 1970 in support of 4 CMBG until the close out of Canada's NATO commitment there in 1993. Service battalions were historically part of Canadian mechanized brigade groups (CMBG), but were transferred to area support groups (ASG) in the late 1990s. In 2013, ASGs were renamed Canadian division support groups, and the service battalions were returned from these formations to the brigades. On 1 April 2010, the Army Reserve Service Battalions were modernized and aligned to represent the Canadian Brigade Group they were part of and to which they provide the Combat Service Support (Logistic and Maintenance). Though the number of units was reduced from 19 to 10, the overall strength (# f personnel) increased in-line with their role, the provision of combat support, logistic and maintenance resources to their respective Canadian Brigade Groups. =Reserve Force= * 31 Canadian Brigade Group London (Ontario) ** 31 Service Battalion, amalgamation of the 21 (Windsor), 22 (London), and 23 (Hamilton) service battalions * 32 Canadian Brigade Group, Toronto, (Ontario) ** 32 Service Battalion, former 25 (Toronto) Service Battalion * 33 Canadian Brigade Group, Ottawa, (Ontario) ** 33 Service Battalion, amalgamation of the 26 (North Bay) and 28 (Ottawa) service battalions * 34 Canadian Brigade Group, Montreal, (Quebec) ** 34 Service Battalion, former 51 (Montreal) Service Battalion * 35 Canadian Brigade Group, Quebec City, (Quebec) ** 35 Service Battalion, amalgamation of the 52 (Sherbrooke) and 55 (Quebec City) service battalions * 36 Canadian Brigade Group, Halifax, (Nova Scotia) ** 36 Service Battalion, amalgamation of the 33 (Halifax) and 35 (Sydney) service battalions * 37 Canadian Brigade Group, Moncton, (New Brunswick) ** 37 Service Battalion, amalgamation of the 31 (Saint John), 32 (Moncton), and 36 (Newfoundland) service battalions * 38 Canadian Brigade Group, Winnipeg, (Manitoba) ** 38 Service Battalion, amalgamation of the 16 (Saskatchewan), 17 (Winnipeg), and 18 (Thunder Bay) service battalions * 39 Canadian Brigade Group, Vancouver, (British Columbia) ** 39 Service Battalion, amalgamation of 11 (Victoria) Service Battalion and 12 (Vancouver) Service Battalion * 41 Canadian Brigade Group, Calgary, (Alberta) ** 41 Service Battalion, amalgamation of 14 (Calgary) Service Battalion and 15 (Edmonton) Service Battalion Operational employment Although Canadian service battalions were a product of the Cold War and were expected to operate as complete units in support of Canadian Army brigades and brigade groups in the field, since the September 11 terrorist attacks, the non-linear battlefield has meant a shift towards the provision of service support to ongoing operations, e.g. in Afghanistan being provided by National Support Elements, tailored to the task at hand and not necessarily formed of just one service battalion. Service battalions are now thus largely force- generation units, and provide essential support in garrison. LCol John Conrad bleakly described the evolution of Canadian logistics in his book, What the Thunder Said: Reflections of a Canadian Officer in Kandahar. He deployed to Afghanistan with an establishment capped at 300 all-ranks that almost failed to fuel, fix and feed troops during Operation Medusa in the summer of 2006. The doctrine, he describes, was unprepared for the intensity of mobile 360¬∞ warfare. At one point the planners lost count of LAV III cannon ammunition just as the battle group was firing much more ammunition than any calculation tables predicted. He also wrote about his own command group hitting an improvised explosive device west of Kandahar City, conducted the response drills then summoning his administration clerk with mock gravity to draft CF52 General Allowance Claim to replace the underwear he soiled. Conrad's book is a surprising but rare glimpse inside the logistics function in battle.

An autoblock (or autobloc or \\"third hand\\") is a rope device used in climbing and caving for both rappelling (downward) and ascending (upward). While rappelling, it slides freely down the rope when pushed downward by the hand, allowing a controlled descent, but jams in the event of a sudden drop or loss of control, stopping the descent. This prevents uncontrolled falls in the event of an accident in which the abseiler loses control of the rope. For ascending, it likewise can be pushed up the rope manually when unweighted, but jams and holds when weighted by the body. It is made using a friction hitch around the rope, connected by a carabiner to the climber's harness, and may be combined with other climbing equipment for further safety. For instance, it is typically used as a backup while rappelling using a tube belay device. The term autoblock is also used for a specific type of friction hitch, which is also known as a French prusik or Machard knot, named after its inventor, Serge Machard. Other friction hitches that can be used to build an autoblock system include the Prusik knot, Klemheist knot, and Bachmann knot. The Ashley Book of Knots #505.

It is extinct and was only ever known from a single specimen. Its taxonomic status is doubtful; it is most likely a subspecies of the Guam kingfisher, which would make its scientific name Todiramphus cinnamomina miyakoensis. As the specimen is extant at the Yamashina Institute for Ornithology, the question could be resolved using DNA sequence analysis; at any rate, the Guam kingfisher is almost certainly the closest relative of the Ryukyu bird. The IUCN considers this bird a subspecies and has hence struck it from its redlist. The one known bird, probably a male, was according to its label collected on Miyako-jima, the main island of the Miyako group, Ry≈´ky≈´ Shot≈ç, on February 5, 1887. While it is often and correctly stated that specimen labels may be incorrect or misleading, the locality, to the northwest of the extant populations of Todiramphus cinnamomina, seems sound in a biogeographical sense. At least the specimen labels of Ryukyu collections by later Japanese collectors are usually very reliable; whether this is true for earlier collection too is not known. The only differences between the Miyako- jima bird and males of the Guam kingfisher (the nominate subspecies of the Micronesian kingfisher; presently only surviving in captivity) are the former's lack of a black nape band and the red feet (black in Guam birds). The bill color is unknown due to damage to the specimen, and supposed differences in the proportion of the remiges are almost certainly an artifact of specimen preparation. Indeed, the specimen was not recognized as distinct until some 30 years after its collection. If the bird was indeed a resident of the Miyako group (and as there was better habitat on neighboring Irabu-jima, it is probable that it would have been found there too), it became extinct in the late 19th century. While this seems early, the population must have always been small as there never was much habitat available in historic times. Certainly, thorough research in the early 20th century failed to find the bird again. The reasons for the disappearance of the population would have been land clearance and draining of wetlands for agriculture.

He is a commercial real-estate developer and an attorney. He was an appointee by the first President Bush to a post steering the federal government's bailout of the savings and loan industry. Monroe earlier had served with United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp as the chief operating officer at the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Peter Monroe is best known as noted in Willam Seidman's Book \\"Full Faith and Credit \\" for serving as president and CEO of the Resolution Trust Corporation Oversight Board https://wikileaks.org/wiki/CRS-RS22959 ‚Äì the Federal agency charged with overseeing the $400 billion clean-up of the savings and loan disaster. L. William Seidman in his book entitled Full Faith and Credit described Monroe as \\"a leader in promoting the RTC's pioneering securitization of commercial mortgages\\". Earlier in his career, Monroe held a senior housing position on the immediate staff of HUD Secretary George Romney. Peter Monroe graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Williams College, was a Rhodes Scholar finalist, graduated with a \\"first-class\\" master's degree from Oxford University, and obtained his law degree from Harvard University. In 2006, Monroe, then a liberal Republican, sought nomination as the Republicans' Senate candidate in Florida's primary elections. While being endorsed by the Palm Beach Post, the South Florida Sun Sentinel, the Florida Times Union, and the Daytona Beach News Journal, who all recognized Monroe's knowledge of economic matters and expertise in running two federal agencies, and endorsed him in Florida's Republican Senate primary, Monroe lost to Katherine Harris. Monroe believes that he was hampered in his campaign by the fact that he was challenging the very Florida Secretary of State who ordered cessation of the presidential 2004 campaign vote recount in Florida-- ultimately leading to a victory by George Bush over Senator Al Gore. During his campaign, Monroe implored the Florida Congressional delegation, and wrote numerous articles advocating a federal catastrophic insurance program intended to spread natural disaster risk throughout the US. Monroe, born in Detroit, has deep roots in the automotive industry. His grandfather, Herbert H. Hills, purchased in 1904 the first Buick ever produced, and held senior positions at Buick and Packard Motor Car Company.

The theatre was founded in 1974. History Founded in 1974, the theatre works with marginalized and disadvantaged communities using a combination of documentary theatre, music and recorded voices. The aim of the company is to create issue-led productions based on real-life experiences and in support of disenfranchised sections of society, performing to community and trade union audiences in pubs, clubs and community centres and at rallies, festivals and conferences. A founder member of the company was former BBC radio producer Charles Parker, who with Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger, created the radio ballads, award-winning musical documentaries broadcast by the BBC in the 1960s and now available via Listen Again on the BBC Radio 2 website. These have been a major influence on Banner's work and have recently informed development of a new form, the 'video ballad'. Another founder member, and current artistic director, is Dave Rogers. He has written many of the company's songs and written or co-written most of their shows. Some 80 of his songs are published in Singing the Changes (Bread Books 2005) as well as social background and photographs from Banner's archives. Others have been released on Banner albums such as Black and White in the Red, Elixir of Life and Wild Geese. Banners have been an important feature of the trade union movement, and provided the inspiration for the company's name and logo.

The barracks closed in the late 2000s, and the site is currently being redeveloped for residential use by Qatari Diar, a subsidiary of the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA). History Lorries of a mobile recruiting team lined up at Chelsea Barracks during the Second World War The 1960s tower blocks at Chelsea Barracks just before demolition in 2008 Chelsea Barracks, Stanford's Map Of Central London 1897 The original barracks, designed by George Morgan to house two battalions of infantry, were completed in 1862. The barracks comprised a long and monotonous brick structure broken by towers in the centre. The original arrangement included a chapel, which survives, and the interior of which includes pictures of King David, the Prophet Joshua, Saint John and Saint James, as well as some panels listing the names of soldiers killed in action. It is now a Grade II listed building. In the late 1950s, the original buildings, excluding the chapel, were demolished, and in June 1960, construction started on two 13-storey concrete tower-blocks designed by Tripe and Wakeham, which were completed in 1962. The tower blocks were used to accommodate four companies from the Guards Regiments. A nail-bomb attack on the barracks by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in September 1981 killed two civilians and injured up to 50. Development of the site The Chelsea Barracks (foreground) in the final stages of demolition. On 6 September 2005 Secretary of State for Defence, John Reid, announced that Chelsea Barracks would be sold. He described it as needing extensive renovations. The site was vacated in 2008 with the troops transferred to the Royal Artillery Barracks at Woolwich. The site was part of the Ministry of Defence's Project MoDEL that saw it and five other sites across London sold off, mainly for housing. Westminster City Council published its draft planning brief for the Chelsea Barracks site in September 2006. It included a commitment to develop 50% of the site with affordable housing. A Community Forum was established by local residents in April 2006 with the support of Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, John Hutton MP, to campaign for greater transparency in the sale of the barracks site and for the 50% affordable homes commitment to be realised. =2007 sale= The barracks is in one of London's most expensive residential areas and was originally expected to sell for ¬£250m. In April 2007 the Ministry of Defence agreed to sell Chelsea Barracks in its site for ¬£959 million to a consortium consisting of Qatari Diar and the CPC Group. On 1 February 2008, the joint venture took possession of the site. Subsequently, CPC's interest in the joint venture company, Project Blue Ltd, was acquired by Qatari Diar, which now owns 100% of the site. =Withdrawn Richard Rogers scheme= In 2008, a proposed scheme for the barracks site - designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners - was submitted to Westminster Council. The masterplan was a contemporary design with series of copper, glass and concrete pavilions - with 638 residential units including 50% affordable units. However, the proposal was criticised by Charles, Prince of Wales, who preferred a more traditional design for the site. The developers Qatari Diar subsequently withdrew the planning application in June 2009. Richard Rogers publicly criticised the Prince's intervention following the withdrawal. In May 2010, some of the developers made an ¬£81m claim at the High Court, blaming Prince Charles for the withdrawal of a planning application. The claim was later reduced to ¬£68m.Prince Charles 'voiced local views' on Chelsea Barracks, BBC News, 29 June 2010 The High Court ruled that Qatari Diar breached a contract with developers CPC Group, when it withdrew Richard Rogers' Chelsea Barracks scheme. The High Court handed a partial victory to property development firm CPC Group, who demanded compensation after plans to redevelop London's Chelsea Barracks were shelved. Christian and Nick Candy blamed an intervention by Prince Charles for giving their partners, Qatari Diar, cold feet.Candy brothers win Chelsea Barracks case, Building.co.uk, 25 June 2010 =New masterplan= A new masterplan - designed by Squire and Partners - was approved by Westminster Council in 2011. The site will be built over multiple phases over several years. The scheme will have 448 residential units including 123 affordable units (27%), as well as a new leisure centre, NHS medical centre, community centre and local shops. In May 2014, Westminster Council granted detailed planning consent for the first phase of the scheme, consisting of 68 apartments across three eight-storey blocks and includes five new garden squares. Construction on this first phase began in 2015. Residents began to move into the development in October 2019.

In particular, he is remembered for his collaboration with Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger on the 1958-1963 series of Radio Ballads, which won an Italia Prize for Radio Documentary in 1960 and is seen as a landmark of study in oral history. He came to believe passionately in the value of the testimony of working people and the creative importance of the oral tradition and its relationship to folk music. This became the key to his work in radio, theatre and in his extensive teaching activities. He was a founder, writer, singer and actor with Banner Theatre in Birmingham from 1974-1980 and in 1966 established the Birmingham and Midland Folk Centre with Roy Palmer, Pam and Alan Bishop, Joan Smith, Olga Nicholls and other enthusiasts in the area. Legacy The Charles Parker Archive is deposited in the Archives & Heritage Service at the Library of Birmingham and consists of tapes, production books, papers, correspondence and scripts for most of the programmes Charles Parker produced and the organisations in which he was active. It contains historical records for studying the culture of the 1950s-1970s in broadcasting, the folk revival, pop music, community arts - as well as contemporary social and political issues. Parker made programmes with blind people, Irish labourers, workers in China in 1972, Asian teenagers, protesters against the Vietnam War and other minorities traditionally denied a voice on the air. Parker collaborated on several occasions with documentarist Philip Donnellan, notably on 'The Colony' (1963) and 'The Irishmen' (1965). The Charles Parker Archive Trust is active in promoting the Archive and in fundraising to disseminate its contents. Two Heritage Lottery grants have enabled cataloguing to take place within the City of Birmingham's Collecting Histories project. Charles Parker Day The annual Charles Parker Day was first organised by Professor Se√°n Street of the Centre for Broadcasting History Research at Bournemouth University. This has been hosted at Bournemouth, at the School of Media in Birmingham City University, at the University of Sunderland and most recently at the Library of Birmingham. The day takes the form of a conference celebrating Charles Parker's work, the radio feature in general, and other related topics. The Charles Parker Day is now organised by Andy Cartwright, of Soundscape Productions and the University of Sunderland, on behalf of the Charles Parker Trust and is now hosted by universities around the UK. From 2008 to 2014 the conference celebrated the 50th anniversaries of the Radio Ballads; 2008 - 'The Ballad of John Axon' (Bournemouth), 2009 - 'The Song of a Road' (Bradford Media Museum), 2010 - 'Singing the Fishing' (University of Sunderland), 2011 - 'The Big Hewer' (University of Sunderland at CastleGate Centre, Newcastle), 2012 - 'The Body Blow' (University of Westminster), 2013 - 'On the Edge' and 'The Fight Game' (Salford University) and 2014 - 'The Travelling People' (Library of Birmingham). Since then the days have been held at Glasgow‚Äôs Centre for Contemporary Arts (2015), University of the West of England in Bristol (2016), Sheffield Hallam University Students Union (2017) and the British Library (2018). The 2019 event will take place at the Bournemouth University‚Äôs Faculty of Media and Communication on Friday 5 April 2019. The Charles Parker Prize The Charles Parker Prize is awarded each year for the Best Student Radio Feature. The prize was introduced in 2005 and is open to students of radio production in the UK. The feature should in some way reflect an essence of Parker‚Äôs own work ‚Äì for example, story led documentaries (or short features) that bring life to the stories and concerns of ordinary people through creative radio production techniques.

Description Cape Poge Lighthouse pictured from the south.Chappaquiddick Island's eastern edge is a barrier beach formed thousands of years ago by offshore currents that deposited tons of sand. Today this beach extends for seven miles (11 km) from Wasque Point past the Cape Poge Lighthouse to the Gut. Beach stretching north with Cape Poge Bay, left.Tidal waters support extensive salt marshes, especially around Poucha Pond. The Cedars is a grove of century-old, low-growing eastern red cedars sculpted by salt spray and wind. Cape Poge Elbow is home to a gull rookery and nests of piping plovers, least terns, and oyster catchers. West of the dunes lies Cape Poge Bay, where calm, clear waters serve as a nursery for finfish and shellfish. Powerful currents push through the Gut, flushing Cape Poge Bay with oxygen-rich water and attracting striped bass, bluefish, bonito, and albacore. Seasonal tours allow visitors to explore the lighthouse, diverse upland and marine habitats, and world-renowned fishing spots. Annual over-sand vehicle permits are available for qualified vehicles, providing access to of dune roads. The lighthouse can also be reached via a hike from the Dike Bridge.

UPB addressing allows 250 devices per house and 250 houses per transformer, allowing over 64,000 total device addresses and can co-exist with other powerline carrier systems within the same home. , UPB enjoys one of the broadest ranges of device types when compared to most protocols and has support from some major manufacturers in the home automation space. Most notably, Leviton and their Omni series of home automation products, as well as the UPB devices they market. UPB is also supported by many major home automation software manufacturers. A few of which are listed below.  Reliability  UPB is a highly reliable protocol http://www.simply- automated.com/UPB_Technology.php  title=Simply Automated ‚Äî About UPB Technology for home automation. It is not susceptible to RF interference, signal blockage by walls or short distance broadcast issues like some wireless protocols. UPB transmits on the building's existing wiring and has extensive noise reduction circuitry. This allows it to traverse long distances without issues, even across multiple electrical panels. Appliances that have traditionally plagued X10 devices, usually do not affect UPB. In fact, UPB signals can reliably be received by the target device even with significant amounts of electrical noise on the power lines. However, in the event that an appliance in your home causes extreme interference when operating, an inexpensive wire-in noise filter can be applied at the circuit breaker panel to solve the issue.  Interoperability  https://github.com/home- assistant/core/pull/34692 , control of UPB devices is supported by the Home Assistant open source software (in version 0.110 and later).https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/34692 , control of UPB devices is supported by the OpenHAB open source software.https://docs.openhab.org/addons/bindings/upb1/readme.html HomeSeer is a well known commercial home automation software package that has support for UPB. Voice recognition products such as Alexa, Automated Living's HAL and Google's Assistant are supported either directly or indirectly through a device or automation controller. UPB can coexist with other powerline technologies. It can also interoperate with other automation devices that use RF (for example) through the use of a multi protocol automation controller (See Leviton Omni, HomeSeer devices). This allows for a mixed technology automation system to achieve best in class devices from many manufacturers. However, it is interesting to note that unlike most wireless protocols, UPB does not require an automation controller or hub to operate. Since UPB is a peer to peer protocol, individual switches, scene controllers and various types of plug-in modules can be individually programmed to do multiple tasks without the need to purchase a hub or controller. Some examples of actions that can be achieved without a hub or controller would be: timed shutoff of a bathroom fan (timer plug-in module or a switch with timer feature built-in), lights turning on or off based on a photocell's sensing of sunlight (I/O plug- in module), turning on one set of lights with a single tap of the switch and turning on another set of lights or devices on a double tap of the switch (dimmer switch). Turning on/off a Hot Tub (load controller switch), multiple preset light dimming settings (scene controller switch), turn on/off a motorized device (relay switch). Scene controllers with built in Infra Red (IR) sensors are available. This allows for a single programmable remote control (universal remote) like those made by Logitech to control both your lighting and your television or other media devices.

Biography  Walter Hussey, as he was known, was born on 15 May 1909 in Northampton, the younger son of Canon John Rowden Hussey and his wife Lilian. John Hussey was then vicar of St Matthew's Church, Northampton, a living which he had held since the church was built in 1893. As a small boy Walter attended The Knoll, a preparatory school at Woburn Sands, from where he won a foundation scholarship to Marlborough College in 1922. In 1927 he went up to Keble College, Oxford to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics, obtaining his BA in 1930. Before entering Cuddesdon Theological College in July 1931 he spent some time as a schoolmaster at Charleston, a preparatory school in Seaford, Sussex. After his ordination Hussey became curate of the church of St Mary Abbots, Kensington until 1937, during which time he was in charge of the daughter church of St Paul, Kensington, from 1935-6. He then succeeded his father as vicar of St Matthew's, Northampton, a position he held until 1955. In his book, Patron of Art, Hussey wrote \\"Perhaps my succeeding him may suggest nepotism, but I don't think it was. I was not anxious to go there; it seemed that there was little one could do but let the parish down ... my various authorities advised me that it was right that I should go.\\" During his school and university years Hussey had shown an interest in the arts, music, drama, painting and sculpture. His years in London gave him the opportunity of seeing and hearing much that the city had to offer in its concert halls, theatres and art galleries, and he began to take an increasing interest in contemporary art. It became a cause of regret to him to realise how little of this work was being encouraged by the Church. As he later wrote, \\"the arts had become largely divorced from the Church\\". By the time Hussey became vicar of St Matthew's he was already making plans to bring about a rapprochement between the Church and the arts. An early opportunity presented itself as he starting planning the forthcoming golden jubilee celebrations due to take place at St Matthew's in 1943. He had already had the experience of making arrangements for such a jubilee at St Paul's, Kensington, but now he wanted to incorporate a modern musical work into the festival service. As vicar of St Matthew's he celebrated the church's 50th anniversary with a sequence of events and commissions: the commission of the anthem Rejoice in the Lamb from Benjamin Britten; a performance from the BBC Symphony Orchestra (2 October 1943); an organ recital by George Thalben-Ball, and (although it was not completed until 1944), the commission of Henry Moore's sculpture Madonna and Child. Buoyed by the success of the 1943-4 commissions (which attracted national and international media attention), Hussey continued to commission new works of art. Other musical commissions included The Revival by Edmund Rubbra (1944); Festival Anthem by Lennox Berkeley (1945), Lo, the full, final sacrifice from Gerald Finzi (1946), and works by Christopher Headington, Malcolm Arnold and others. There were commissions of poetry: a Litany and Anthem for St Matthew's Day from W. H. Auden and The Outer Planet from Norman Nicholson. Facing the Moore Madonna across the church is Crucifixion (1946) from Graham Sutherland. The tradition of recitals continued throughout this time, most notably with two concerts by the singer Kirsten Flagstad When Hussey left Northampton in 1955 to become Dean of Chichester Cathedral he had known George Bell, bishop of Chichester for many years and knew that they shared the same attitude to art and the Church. Consequently, the work he had begun in St Matthew's continued almost uninterrupted in the cathedral. Among his commissions for Chichester were several works of visual art: the altarpiece \\"Noli me tangere\\" (1961) by Graham Sutherland, a tapestry by John Piper, a new pulpit and other metalwork by Geoffrey Clarke, a painting by Cecil Collins, textiles by Ceri Richards, and stained glass by Marc Chagall, Hussey's final commission (1978). Among numerous works of new music for Chichester, the ones with the highest profile were Leonard Bernstein's Chichester Psalms and the 1975 Chichester Service by William Walton. By the time Hussey retired from Chichester in 1977 to live in London he had acquired an important and varied collection of his own. He offered to leave the greater part of it to the city which he had done so much to promote as a centre of the arts. Like many others he was concerned about the neglect into which Pallant House, a fine example of eighteenth-century domestic architecture, had fallen and, as Dr K. M. E. Murray wrote \\"his generous offer ... was made deliberately as a means of securing the restoration of the house and its opening to the public\\". In 1982 Hussey was present at the official opening of the house and saw his paintings and other works of art displayed in the same informal domestic setting as they had been at the deanery where he had taken so much pleasure in showing them to friends and strangers alike. In his entry in Who's Who, Hussey gave his sole recreation as \\"enjoying the arts\\". This enjoyment, not just of the arts, but of all aspects of his life, shines through the archive of his papers and through the enduring legacy of his life and work, in Chichester Cathedral and at Pallant House, the Chichester gallery that opened in 1982 to inherit and show his personal collection. Hussey finished writing his book Patron of the Arts - The Revival of a Great Tradition Among Modern Artists which was published in 1985 and a documentary about his life, Patron of the Arts, was written and presented by Robert Walker and directed by Christopher Swann. It was broadcast on BBC2 shortly after his death in London on 25 July 1985. His funeral service was conducted at St Paul's, Knightsbridge, and a memorial service was held in Chichester Cathedral in October of that year.

Hussey's own collection of art was bequeathed to the City of Chicester and is now housed in Pallant House Gallery.

A committee, made up of faculty members, was appointed in 1928 to make recommendations, which were approved by the Senate on February 2, 1930. On March 12, 1931, the Board of Trustees established the college for the \\"cultivation of esthetic taste on the part of the student body at large ... and development of general artistic appreciation.\\" The first dean was appointed in 1932. Today, the college includes the Schools of Architecture, Art + Design, and Music; the Departments of Dance, Landscape Architecture, Theatre, and Urban + Regional Planning; Japan House; the Krannert Art Museum; the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts; and Sinfonia da Camera, the university's resident chamber orchestra. The college offers exhibitions, concerts, performances, lectures, master classes, and conferences in all areas of the performing and visual arts and for the designed and built environment. = Department of Urban + Regional Planning = The University of Illinois has a history in the training of urban and regional planners, dating back to 1913 when Charles Mulford Robinson was appointed Professor of Civic Design in the University's Landscape Architecture Division. At that time, only the University of Illinois and Harvard University offered courses in urban planning. In 1945 the university authorized a master's degree in urban planning, and in 1953 an undergraduate degree was established. Both programs were offered in the Department of Landscape Architecture until 1965, when the Department of Urban Planning became its own academic unit. The department established the PhD in Regional Planning in 1983. The Department of Urban and Regional Planning is one of the planning programs in the U.S., and it is one of very few programs that offers three degrees: a Bachelor of Arts in Urban Planning, a Master of Urban Planning, and a Doctor of Philosophy in Regional Planning. It also offers a Minor in Urban Planning, as well as joint master's degree options, including with Law, Architecture, and Business Administration. = Department of Landscape Architecture = This department is rated nationally among the top fifteen programs. It offers a BLA, MLA, and PhD program.

Innovations New Orleans Pelicans Powell is credited with various innovations that changed baseball, though in many cases this is incorrect or overstated. He is incorrectly credited with inventing rain checks and \\"ladies' day\\", but both of these were in use in New Orleans before Powell. However, Powell did improve the existing rain check, adding a perforated stub to ticket when sold so that only purchasers of tickets (and not other spectators, notably free-riders and fence-climbers) could get a new ticket. The idea of Ladies Day was to create an environment in the stands free of unsavory characters and conduct, as well as to make baseball a family-oriented event; it dates at least to 1880 in New Orleans, and the practice is still in place today. Powell scheduled a recurring Ladies Day on April 29 of 1887. Powell is also credited with using an infield tarpaulin so that fields could be ready immediately after rain storms.

The International Phonetic Alphabet symbol for secondary stress is a short vertical line preceding and at the foot of the secondarily stressed syllable, as before the nun in pronunciation (the higher vertical line denotes primary stress). Another tradition in English is to assign acute and grave accents for primary and secondary stress, respectively: pron√πnci√°tion. Most languages have at most one degree of stress on the phonemic level (English is a notable exception according to some analyses). That is, each syllable has stress or it does not. Many languages have rhythmic stress; location of the stress may not be predictable, but when the location of one stressed syllable (which may be the primary stress) is known, certain syllables before or after can be predicted to also be stressed; these may have secondary stress. An example is Dutch, where the rule is that initial and final syllables (word boundaries) take secondary stress, then every alternate syllable before and after the primary stress, as long as two stressed syllables are not adjacent and stress does not fall on (there are, however, some exceptions to this rule). See . A similar rule applies in Romanian: secondary stress falls on every alternate syllable, starting with the first, as long as it does not fall adjacent to the primary stress.Ioana Chi»õoran (2002) The phonology of Romanian, p 88 In other languages (including Egyptian Radio Arabic, Bhojpuri, Cayuga, Estonian, Hawaiian, Kaure, Malayalam, and Warrgamay),StressTyp secondary stress can be predicted to fall on heavy syllables. In other languages, the placement of secondary stress is not predictable, or may not be predictable (and thus be phonemic) for some words. This is frequently posited for Germanic languages, including English. For example, secondary stress is said to arise in compound words like vacuum cleaner, where the first syllable of vacuum has primary stress, while the first syllable of cleaner is usually said to have secondary stress. However, this analysis is problematic; notes that these may be cases of full vs reduced unstressed vowels being interpreted as secondary stress vs unstressed. See Stress and vowel reduction in English for details. In Norwegian, the pitch accent is lost from one of the roots in a compound word, but the erstwhile tonic syllable retains the full length (long vowel or geminate consonant) of a stressed syllable; this has sometimes been characterized as secondary stress.Gjert Kristoffersen (2007) The Phonology of Norwegian, p 184 See also * Pausa Notes Bibliography * Phonology Phonetics ","title":"Secondary stress"},{"id":"5761330","title":"Alone I Break"},{"id":"5761335","text":"T√≠r na n√ìg is an otherworldly realm in Irish mythology.

The College of Law was established in 1897, and offers the J.D., LL.M., and J.S.D. degrees in law. The College of Law also hosts visiting scholars, visiting researchers and a number of legal research centers. The school offers 10 scholarly areas of research, teaching, and coursework, called specialty programs. These are not majors or concentrations in the traditional sense but areas of academic interest and strength within the College of Law. The specialty programs include Business Law and Policy; Comparative Labor and Employment Law Policy; Constitutional Theory, History and Law; Criminal Law and Procedure; Health Law and Policy; Intellectual Property and Technology Law; International and Comparative Law; Law, Behavior and Social Sciences; Law and Philosophy; and Legal History. The College of Law is currently ranked tied for 31st in the U.S. News & World Report rankings. In 2010 and 2011, the College of Law placed 21st and 23rd, respectively, in the rankings before reports surfaced that a school administrator had submitted falsified admissions data. After this incident, the College of Law placed for several years between 35th and 47th in the rankings. Illinois ranked 25th in the 2019 Above The Law rankings of U.S. law schools and 26th in The National Law Journals 2015 \\"Go-To Law Schools\\" Ranking. History The College of Law was founded in 1897 and is a charter member of the Association of American Law Schools. The law honor society known as the Order of the Coif was founded at the University of Illinois College of Law in 1902. University of Illinois College of Law is on the south end of the main University of Illinois campus in Champaign, near Memorial Stadium (Champaign) and the State Farm Center. The University of Illinois College of Law has the 14th largest law library in the United States of America, and the College has several notable alumni in law firms, politics, the judiciary, and academia, including: Albert E. Jenner Jr., name partner at law firm Jenner & Block, Annette Lu, Vice President of the Republic of China from 2000 to 2008, and Philip McConnaughay, current dean of Peking University School of Transnational Law and former Dean of Penn State Dickinson Law. In 2011, in its annual ranking of \\"Go-To Law Schools,\\" the National Law Journal then ranked the University of Illinois College of Law 16th in the number of alumni associates promoted to partner. The College of Law tied with the University of Pennsylvania Law School and Emory University School of Law in 2011. Several of the law schools ranked in the Top 16 ‚Äì including Harvard, Columbia, and Georgetown ‚Äì graduated over twice as many students as the College of Law. In the 2011 U.S. News & World Report ranking of American law schools, the College of Law was ranked 23rd in the country. In its 2021 rankings, U.S. News & World Report ranks the College of Law tied for 31st. =Launch of the Chicago Program= The Chicago Program offers a semester-long program of Chicago-based courses and events for interested third-year students that was launched in 2012. Courses include International Bankruptcy, International Tax, Executive Compensation, and the Chicago Litigation Practicum ‚Äì a simulated federal court litigation that takes students from client interviews, through discovery, through a live motion hearing. Events and lectures are open to all third-year students, offering opportunities to network with the College's more than 3,000 Chicago-based alumni. Launched in 2012, the Chicago Program is designed to enrich the College's curriculum, expand professional opportunities for students, and involve alumni and other practitioners more closely in the College's educational mission. Courses are taught in the Illini Center in downtown Chicago, the Dirksen Federal Courthouse, The Chicago Bar Association, and in the offices of several of the nation's preeminent law firms, including Kirkland & Ellis LLP and McDermott Will & Emery. =Investigation into manipulation of admissions data= On September 11, 2011, The News-Gazette reported that the University of Illinois College of Law posted inaccurate information on its website about the LSAT scores and GPAs of its incoming first-year law students.Paul Wood (9/11/11)UI withdraws inaccurate info about incoming law school class News-Gazette The school removed the inaccurate information and placed an assistant dean on administrative leave. On September 19, 2011, the University of Illinois College of Law posted the corrected information on its website. The actual LSAT and GPA medians for the class of 2014 were 163 and 3.70, respectively. Two months later, the law school announced that a report commissioned from Jones Day and Duff & Phelps had found admission data for six of the seven previous years to have been manipulated by the Assistant Dean of Admissions Paul Pless and that Pless had acted alone and would no longer work for the College. Academics Alma Mater The College of Law offers the Juris Doctor (J.D.), the professional degree in law, as well as the Master of Laws (LL.M) and Doctor of Juridical Science (J.S.D.), academic graduate degrees in law. A program that had been started with the American Bar Association in 2009 to permit certain UIUC undergraduates to enter without an LSAT was shut down in 2012 as part of the penalty for the College's falsification of admission data. In the past seven years, the College has added 28 new tenure-track and tenured faculty, achieving a student-faculty ratio of 13 to 1. The faculty is expected to grow by 15 percent over the next half decade. In Brian Leiter's \\"Top 25 Law Faculties In Scholarly Impact, 2005‚Äì2009\\", the school achieved a joint #21 rank. There are currently 662 students in the J.D. program. Thirty-six students from nine countries are enrolled in the one-year international LL.M. program. Students come from 42 states, 14 countries, and 189 undergraduate institutions. Over 30 percent of students are people of color, which is the highest percentage among public universities in Illinois and in the Big Ten.University of Illinois College of Law, Accessed May 7, 2009, Current Students. http://www.law.illinois.edu/current-students/ The flagship law review is the University of Illinois Law Review; the law school also publishes two specialized law journals, the Elder Law Journal and the Journal of Law, Technology & Policy, which in 2007 ExpressO then ranked as the #4 Science & Technology law journal. The College is also the home institution for the Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal, and for Law and Philosophy. The Albert E. Jenner, Jr. Memorial Library is the College's law library. It is the 14th largest academic law library in the United States, with some 750,000 volumes. Employment According to the College of Law's official 2016 ABA- required disclosures, 78.92% of the Class of 2016 obtained full-time, long- term, JD-required employment 10 months after graduation. This was then the 19th highest out of all law schools in the United States. Law School Transparency under-employment score is 10.8%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2016 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non- professional, short-term, or part-time job ten months after graduation. Costs The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at UIUC Law for the 2014‚Äì2015 academic year was $59,772 for Illinois residents and $67,522 for out-of-state students. The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years was then $217,510 for residents and $246,495 for out-of-state. Rankings In 1957 the Chicago Sunday Tribune released the first modern rankings of law schools, and included Illinois among the top 10 law schools in America. In its annual 2011 ranking of \\"Go-To Law Schools,\\" the National Law Journal then ranked the University of Illinois College of Law 16th in the number of alumni associates promoted to partner. In the 2010 U.S. News & World Report ranking of American law schools, the College of Law was ranked 21st in the country and in the 2011 it was ranked 23rd in the country. In the 2012 U.S. News and World Report ranking of American law schools, the College of Law was originally ranked 23rd in the country. However, in the wake of the grades and LSAT inflation scandal, that ranking fell from #23 to #35 in 2012, and dropped to 47th in 2013. In the 2014 U.S. News and World Report rankings, the College rose to 40th. In 2015, it dropped one spot to 41st. In 2018, the ranking rose to 37th, and rose again to 31st in the 2020 rankings. The College of Law‚Äôs 31st place tied with a few other law schools, including Boston College and William & Mary Law School. The popular website Above the Law ranked the College of Law #22 in 2017. Prof. Brian Leiter, a University of Chicago law professor and well known for his blogs about law schools and law school rankings, said that the University of Illinois College of Law is a top 20 law school. In 2012, the National Jurist named the University of Illinois College of Law in its list of the 20 most innovative law schools, based on more than 40 submissions.

After the war, the club became The Bees and have been involved every season from 1948 until the loss of Brandon stadium shortly before the start of the 2017 season, during which they ran a series of challenge matches at other tracks. They won the Elite League Championship in 2010, defeating the Poole Pirates in both legs of the play-off grand finals. It was the ninth time that the club have been crowned League Champions, following on from successes achieved in 1953, 1968, 1978, 1979, 1987, 1988, 2005 and 2007. On 28 October 2007, the Bees lifted the Elite League Knockout Cup for the second year running, defeating the Swindon Robins in the final, completing a clean sweep of all three major trophies, having already annexed the Craven Shield by beating Swindon Robins and the Poole Pirates over the three leg final. On 24 November 2010 following changes to the rules for rider averages made at the Annual General Meeting of the BSPA, the Coventry Bees and Peterborough Panthers walked out of the meeting. As a result, on 27 November 2010 the BSPA omitted both teams from the 2011 Elite League for failing to declare their intent to compete in the 2011 league at the AGM. The decision is set to be the subject of a legal challenge by both clubs. On 17 February 2011, it was announced by the BSPA that both Coventry and Peterborough would not be competing in the Elite League. Both clubs rejected an offer from the BSPA issued on 31 January 2011, which would have permitted both clubs to continue with their proposed legal action (including claims for compensation from any losses) whilst resuming their league membership with immediate effect. On 15 March 2011 it was announced that both the Coventry Bees and Peterborough Panthers would be part of the 2011 Elite League season. However this was not officially confirmed by the BSPA despite announcements by Peterborough and Coventry bees co-promoter, Allen Trump. On 8 April 2011, the BSPA officially confirmed both teams had returned to the Elite League for the 2011 season. On 11 August 2011 Edward Kennett resigned from Coventry Speedway, after it was deemed his silencer was 'illegal' when racing against Lakeside on 6 August. Kennett said this was caused by 'a member of his team' who had 'tampered with it'. Kennett was banned from racing for 7 days by the SCB and appeared in front of a disciplinary hearing on 16 August where he received a 6-month worldwide ban. On 21 September 2011 the Bees were put up for sale by owner Avtar Sandhu. The club is now owned by businessman Mick Horton, and the promotional licence is held jointly by Colin Pratt and Mick Horton. On 26 February 2017 it was announced by the BSPA that the club has had its licence frozen and therefore would not be competing in the Speedway Great Britain Premiership 2017 season. The licence being frozen was due to the club being unable to satisfy the BSPA that they can fulfil a full season of league racing. This was primarily due to having an agreement with Leicester Lions to only use their stadium for a handful of fixtures and not having any guarantees of being able to return to Brandon Stadium for the remaining fixtures. The Bees were reformed to compete in the 2018 National League, with home meetings being staged at Leicester.\\"SGB Statement: Coventry Bees\\", speedwaygb.co, 9 January 2018. Retrieved 18 January 2018 The Bees became homeless once more in 2019 as the Leicester promotion decided to run their own National League junior team (The Cubs). Brandon Stadium today lies derelict with several planning applications having been made for a new housing estate. Despite this many Bees enthusiasts supported by the local council are campaigning for the return of Speedway and Stock Car racing to the stadium. Brandon Stadium Coventry Stadium at Brandon Between 1928 and 2016, the team rode at Brandon Stadium in Brandon, Warwickshire.

Students seeking the MS/LIS, MS/IM, or CAS degree can earn their degree as an on-campus student or as a distance student via the Leep online learning option. For doctoral students, at least one year of residency is required on campus. Reputation The School of Information Sciences' MS/LIS degree has been ranked as the top library and information science (LIS) graduate program in the country by U.S. News & World Report since 1996. In the Research and Markets' 2008-2009 Survey of Academic Libraries, Illinois was ranked the number one library and information science program in the U.S. and Canada. As of 2017, the school is also ranked by U.S. News & World Report as first in services for children and youth, first in digital libraries, and third in school media library in comparison to other U.S. and Canada library and information science schools. History The program has its roots in the Library Science Program at the Armour Institute of Chicago created in September 1893 as part of the strong cultural movement following the Industrial Revolution to professionally educate men and women for the upcoming twentieth century and for the technical world.Grotzinger 1992, p. 2 The public library had come to be seen by most as a \\"university of the people,\\" and those who were to become the \\"best librarians\\" were those formally educated in the trade.Grotzinger 1992, p. 2 Seeking a director, Gunsaulus, the president of the Institute, asked Melvil Dewey to recommend the best person for the job. Dewey recommended Katharine Sharp, who was finishing up her library science degree program in Dewey's school in Albany, NY.Grotzinger 1992, p. 5 Once established, the school became the only library science program in the Midwest and the fourth in the United States. Sharp, in turn, became the library school: \\"Her enthusiasm, her drive, and her unswerving dedication were the determining factors for the school during its formative years in Chicago as well as the following ten years when she directed the Illinois State Library School on the Urbana‚ÄìChampaign campus.\\"Grotzinger 1992, p. 6-7 The school in Chicago, operating off of a technical institute model, began taking on a university structure under Sharp's leadership. The Armour facility did not provide enough collection or classroom space that was needed, and finances were becoming tight. The University of Illinois and the University of Wisconsin were interested in the program, and both universities offered to accept Sharp's program. Sharp chose the University of Illinois, and the program moved to Urbana.Grotzinger 1992, p. 9 The initial location for the library science program was in Altgeld Hall where it remained until 1926. It then moved to the Main Library for the next fifty three years until 1979. The program then relocated to David Kinley Hall until 1993. An additional relocation went underway when the University purchased property from Acacia fraternity's Illinois Heth chapter and moved the school to its current location at Fifth and Daniel Streets.http://www.rushacacia.com/History The school officially changed its name from the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS) to the School of Information Sciences in June 2016.http://ischool.illinois.edu/articles/2015/10/faculty-vote-favor-name- change-proposal Facilities The school is located on the corner of Fifth and Daniel streets in Champaign, Illinois. It is situated next to the Department of Speech and Hearing Science and across the street from the Department of Psychology. The building was formerly the location of the Acacia and still has functional showers for both men and women along with three kitchens. Other areas, such as the second floor lounge and the doctoral student area, serve as study spots for students. Wireless Internet access is also available in all public areas, and technology support is provided by the department's Help Desk on the second floor. The Help Desk is staffed by current iSchool master's students. The building is also in close proximity to many campus libraries.

If it can be so expressed, it is decomposable: Z = X + Y. If, further, it can be expressed as the distribution of the sum of two or more independent identically distributed random variables, then it is divisible: Z = X1 + X2. Examples = Indecomposable = * The simplest examples are Bernoulli distributions: if ::X = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\text{with probability } p, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{with probability } 1-p, \\\\end{cases} :then the probability distribution of X is indecomposable. :Proof: Given non-constant distributions U and V, so that U assumes at least two values a, b and V assumes two values c, d, with a < b and c < d, then U + V assumes at least three distinct values: a + c, a + d, b + d (b + c may be equal to a + d, for example if one uses 0, 1 and 0, 1). Thus the sum of non- constant distributions assumes at least three values, so the Bernoulli distribution is not the sum of non-constant distributions. * Suppose a + b + c = 1, a, b, c ‚â• 0, and ::X = \\\\begin{cases} 2 & \\\\text{with probability } a, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & \\\\text{with probability } b, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{with probability } c. \\\\end{cases} :This probability distribution is decomposable (as the sum of two Bernoulli distributions) if ::\\\\sqrt{a} + \\\\sqrt{c} \\\\le 1 \\\\ :and otherwise indecomposable. To see, this, suppose U and V are independent random variables and U + V has this probability distribution. Then we must have :: \\\\begin{matrix} U = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\text{with probability } p, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{with probability } 1 - p, \\\\end{cases} & \\\\mbox{and} & V = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\text{with probability } q, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{with probability } 1 - q, \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{matrix} :for some p, q ‚àà [0, 1], by similar reasoning to the Bernoulli case (otherwise the sum U + V will assume more than three values). It follows that ::a = pq, \\\\, ::c = (1-p)(1-q), \\\\, ::b = 1 - a - c. \\\\, :This system of two quadratic equations in two variables p and q has a solution (p, q) ‚àà [0, 1]2 if and only if ::\\\\sqrt{a} + \\\\sqrt{c} \\\\le 1. \\\\ :Thus, for example, the discrete uniform distribution on the set {0, 1, 2} is indecomposable, but the binomial distribution for three trials each having probabilities 1/2, 1/2, thus giving respective probabilities a, b, c as 1/4, 1/2, 1/4, is decomposable. * An absolutely continuous indecomposable distribution. It can be shown that the distribution whose density function is ::f(x) = {1 \\\\over \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi\\\\,}} x^2 e^{-x^2/2} :is indecomposable. = Decomposable = * All infinitely divisible distributions are a fortiori decomposable; in particular, this includes the stable distributions, such as the normal distribution. * The uniform distribution on the interval [0, 1] is decomposable, since it is the sum of the Bernoulli variable that assumes 0 or 1/2 with equal probabilities and the uniform distribution on [0, 1/2]. Iterating this yields the infinite decomposition: :: \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty {X_n \\\\over 2^n }, :where the independent random variables Xn are each equal to 0 or 1 with equal probabilities ‚Äì this is a Bernoulli trial of each digit of the binary expansion. * A sum of indecomposable random variables is necessarily decomposable (as it is a sum), and in fact may a fortiori be an infinitely divisible distribution (not just decomposable as the given sum). Suppose a random variable Y has a geometric distribution ::\\\\Pr(Y = n) = (1-p)^n p\\\\, :on {0, 1, 2, ...}. For any positive integer k, there is a sequence of negative- binomially distributed random variables Yj, j = 1, ..., k, such that Y1 + ... + Yk has this geometric distribution. Therefore, this distribution is infinitely divisible. But now let Dn be the nth binary digit of Y, for n ‚â• 0\\\\. Then the Ds are independent and :: Y = \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty {D_n \\\\over 2^n}, : :and each term in this sum is indecomposable.  Related concepts  At the other extreme from indecomposability is infinite divisibility. * Cram√©r's theorem shows that while the normal distribution is infinitely divisible, it can only be decomposed into normal distributions. * Cochran's theorem shows that the terms in a decomposition of a sum of squares of normal random variables into sums of squares of linear combinations of these variables always have independent chi-squared distributions.

It extends from a continuation of NY 5A at an interchange with NY 5, NY 8, NY 12, and Interstate 790 (I-790) in Utica to an interchange with NY 890 in Rotterdam. The route runs along the south side of the Mohawk River for its entire length and parallels NY 5, which runs along the north side of the Mohawk River (hence the \\"S\\" in the route number of NY 5S). NY 5S intersects several primary routes including NY 28 in Mohawk, NY 30A in Fultonville, NY 30 south of Amsterdam, as well as intersecting the New York State Thruway (I-90) several times. The route is part of New York State Bicycle Route 5 west of its junction with NY 103 in Schenectady County. In 1924, the portion of modern NY 5S between Utica and Mohawk was designated as the northernmost portion of NY 28, which connected Oneonta to Utica. When NY 5S was assigned in 1930, the route stretched from Oneida in the west to Schenectady in the east, absorbing the old section of NY 28\\\\. It was later truncated on both ends to eliminate overlaps with other state routes and to accommodate the construction of other roadways, most notably I-890 in western Schenectady. In some locations, NY 5S has been upgraded into a super two or an expressway, mostly in Utica and western Herkimer County. Route description NY 5S westbound approaching its western terminus NY 5S begins at an interchange with I-790 in downtown Utica, where Oriskany Street changes designations from NY 5A to NY 5S. At this interchange, I-790 is concurrent with NY 5, NY 8, and NY 12 along Utica's North‚ÄìSouth Arterial. The freeway connects NY 5S to the New York State Thruway. From this interchange, NY 5S travels east across Utica as an urban arterial roadway with at grade intersections, including one with Genesee Street (NY 921C, an unsigned reference route) and one with John Street (unsigned NY 921P). After it crosses Broad Street, it continues east as a limited-access highway with grade-separated intersections to the Herkimer County line. NY 5S westbound at east end of overlap with NY 28 The highway meets a trumpet interchange with Culver Avenue as it enters Herkimer County. Roughly east from here, is an interchange for Turner Street, a small connector road. NY 5S enters West Frankfort and has an exit for Dyke Road, which connects to the Thruway and NY 5\\\\. In West Frankfort, it parallels one of its many old alignments. NY 5S continues southward, encountering a diamond interchange with Higby Road and Cemetery Street in Frankfort. Just past the Herkimer County Fairgrounds, NY 5S crosses under NY 171, the latter of which it doesnt connect to. In East Frankfort, NY 5S intersects with its old routing and turns to the east. NY 5S enters Ilion, where it meets a partial cloverleaf interchange with NY 51\\\\. NY 5S passes to the south of Herkimer and has junctions with local roads before intersecting and briefly overlapping NY 28 in Mohawk. While in Mohawk, NY 5S also intersects with South Washington Street (unsigned NY 922B). NY 5S and NY 10 signs in Canajoharie Past Mohawk, NY 5S begins to parallel the Mohawk River and the Thruway as it continues eastward. NY 5S enters the town of Little Falls, and has a brief overlap with NY 167, and then begins to climb Fall Hill. At the other side of the hill, the highway intersects the southern terminus of NY 169, which connects NY 5S with exit 29A on the Thruway. From here, NY 5S passes through farmlands and parallels the Thruway even farther before reaching the village of Fort Plain, where it has a brief overlap with NY 80\\\\. From NY 80, NY 5S continues east, paralleling the Thruway, before intersecting NY 10 in the village of Canajoharie. In the latter, NY 5S is village-maintained in the immediate vicinity of its junction with NY 10\\\\. This stretch is the only part of the route that is not maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Shortly past NY 10, the highway intersects exit 29 of the Thruway. From here, the highway continues east for roughly before intersecting the northern terminus of NY 162 in the town of Root. NY 5S approaching its eastern terminus NY 5S enters Fultonville, and intersects with NY 30A, which connects NY 5S with exit 28 on the Thruway. From NY 30A, NY 5S continues east for just over to an intersection with Riverside Drive (unsigned NY 920P), which also leads to exit 28 on the Thruway. From here, it continues east for a short distance and intersects Noeltner Road, which was the northern terminus of former NY 288\\\\. About past Noeltner Road, it crosses to the north side of the Thruway, where it stays until its eastern terminus. NY 5S continues east then enters the City of Amsterdam and intersects with NY 30, which connects NY 5S with downtown Amsterdam and exit 27 on the Thruway. Past NY 30, it continues for about into the town of Florida, where it intersects Thayer Road, which was the former western terminus of NY 160\\\\. From here, NY 5S continues along the south side of the Mohawk River for roughly , then crosses into Schenectady County. Just past the county line, it intersects the northern terminus of NY 160 (Scotch Church Road). NY 5S continues eastward through the town of Rotterdam for just over , then intersects the southern terminus of NY 103 (Bridge Street). The highway continues east from here for just over , before ending at an interchange with NY 890, which connects to I-890 and the Thruway in the town of Rotterdam. History NY 5S westbound between NY 28 and South Washington Street In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 6, an unsigned legislative route that began in Buffalo and proceeded eastward across New York to Albany. From Utica to Schenectady, Route 6 followed the banks of the Mohawk River through the Mohawk Valley. Initially, Route 6 used the modern NY 5S corridor from Utica to Mohawk and from Fultonville to Amsterdam. By 1920, the piece of what is now NY 5S from Mohawk to Little Falls became part of Route 26. On March 1, 1921, Route 26 was truncated to begin in Little Falls while Route 6 was realigned between Fultonville and Amsterdam to use NY 5 instead. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the portion of legislative Route 6 between Utica and Mohawk was designated as the northernmost portion of NY 28, a north-south route connecting Oneonta to Utica via Springfield and Richfield Springs. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 28 was rerouted north of Mohawk to follow its modern alignment toward Poland. Its former routing between Utica and Mohawk became part of NY 5S, an alternate route of NY 5 between Oneida and Schenectady. As its suffix implies, NY 5S was mostly a southerly alternate route of NY 5; however, it actually followed a more northerly routing than NY 5 west of Utica. It continued west to Oneida on what is now NY 5A, NY 69, NY 365, and NY 365A and east into Schenectady along Rice and River Roads. NY 5S was truncated eastward to Utica in the early 1940s, placing all of NY 5S south of NY 5 for the first time. On its eastern end, NY 5S was gradually truncated to its current terminus in Rotterdam as portions of I-890 was built over the former routing of NY 5S between Rotterdam and Schenectady. The first cutback occurred in the early 1970s following the completion of I-890 between downtown Schenectady and exit 4. The freeway was completed between the New York State Thruway (I-90) and Schenectady in the mid-1970s, resulting in the truncation of NY 5S to I-890 exit 2. It was truncated to its current eastern terminus at I-890 (now NY 890) in the late 1980s after a reconfiguration of the interchange between the Thruway and I-890 resulted in the removal of River Road between I-890 and the current stub end of Rice Road. Work on the interchange at the eastern terminus began in October 1996, on a project to build a new roadway north across the Mohawk River to NY 5\\\\. The highway was completed in October 1998 and opened to traffic on October 21, 1998. It was designated as NY 890, an extension of a I-890. Old NY 5S at NY 171 in Frankfort From Utica to Mohawk, NY 5S was originally routed on \\"Old Route 5S\\" and Main Street. It was realigned in the early 1970s to follow a new freeway between Utica and Old Route 5S in Ilion that bypassed Frankfort to the west. A super two extension of the freeway east to Mohawk was started sometime after 1982 and finished by the mid-1990s. On April 5, 1987, the bridge carrying the New York State Thruway over Schoharie Creek collapsed. At the time, the creek was higher and flowing faster than normal due to excessive rains in the area. The segment of NY 5S near Fort Hunter was reconfigured to carry westbound Thruway traffic while the bridge was rebuilt. The eastbound replacement bridge was completed and fully open to traffic on December 7, 1987, and the westbound replacement bridge was opened on May 21, 1988. =Memorial designation= On July 24, 2019, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law that a portion of NY 5S was to be designated the \\"Sergeant Jeremy J. Van Nostrand Memorial Highway\\" in the town of Glen. Trooper Jeremy Van Nostrand was killed as he was arriving to work. His car was rear ended and pushed into the path of an oncoming truck. The signs were unveiled and the dedication ceremony was held on November 27, 2019.

The ending position of the bag on one trick becomes the starting position of the bag on the next trick. Tricks are created by combining different components between contacts (stalls or kicks, usually stalls). Components can be spins, dexterities (wrapping a leg around the bag in mid-air), or ducks (letting the bag pass a few inches above the neck). Contacts are usually on the inside of the foot behind the opposite support leg (clipper stall) or on the toe, however many inventive possibilities remain and are used to create a near-endless list of tricks.  Competition Events  In competition, there are several different freestyle events. World freestyle footbag champion 2011, 2012 & 2013 in Singles routines, circle and request Jan Weber Multiple world and European Doubles routines champions and innovators of the discipline Martin Sladek and Tomas Tucek =Routines= In this event a player choreographs and executes a routine to music. Much like figure skating, players are given scores for technical and artistic merit. These scores take into account choreography, difficulty, variety, and execution. At the open level, singles routines are 2 minutes long, doubles routines 3 minutes; at the intermediate level and in women category, routines are 90 seconds. =30 Second Shred= Or \\"Shred 30\\" is purely technical. Competitors have to execute as many unique, difficult tricks in a 30 second period as possible. Their score is calculated with a mathematical formula, which takes into account the average difficulty of the run, and penalizes the players for repeated moves. Dropping the bag lowers the player's score in 2 ways: it lowers their difficulty ratio, and decreases the number of tricks they can fit in 30 seconds. The formula is adds + adds*uniques/contacts. =Sick 3= The objective of this event is for players to link three hard tricks together in the most impressive way possible. Players are usually given between 5-7 attempts to land a combo, within a maximum time frame of 2 minutes. This event is often judged by a panel of judges, who sometimes use videocameras to verify that moves were hit cleanly within the combo. Judging is purely subjective. =Sick Trick= In this competition, the most difficult assortment of components is put into one move and judged subjectively by difficulty, form, and cleanliness. Usually the competitor is given 3-7 tries which is at the competition director's discretion =Rippin' Run= In this competition, a minimum of two players start a guiltless string (a series of moves with a minimum requirement of 3 components (adds) in between contacts) and try to outlast each other. Players are eliminated and the winners progress to the next round, just like in the single-elimination tournament. =Circle Competition= Or \\"Circle Comp\\" or just \\"Circle\\" for short is relatively new compared to other events, Circle Comp was invented by Ianek Regimbald and Sebastien Duchesne of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and Eliot Piltz of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with input from several other competitive players. In Circle Comp, the total pool of competitors are divided into smaller pools (or Circles, giving the event its name, and also representing how freestyle footbag is typically played), usually of no more than 4 players. Each player in the circle takes a turn with the bag, until they drop. The bag is then passed to the next player, who takes their turn, and so forth. There is a limit to the number of times the bag will go around the circle. For instance, there may be three difficulty rounds followed by three variety rounds, though organizers of different events may revise the structure of the format in different ways. Players are evaluated subjectively by a panel of judges.http://www.flipsider.com/know/advanced/circle_contest.php  Components (ADD Categories)  Tricks performed while playing freestyle are made up different add categories. ADD is an acronym for \\"Additional Degree of Difficulty\\". A toe stall would be a 1-ADD trick. TOE [DEL]. A \\"clipper\\" is a cross body inside delay CLIP [XBD][DEL] and is worth 2-ADDs. A cross-body sole delay XBD_SOLE [XBD][UNS][DEL] is worth 3-adds. The more adds, the more possible permutations there are for tricks. Moves have been performed up to 9-ADDs (Chilly-Philly Sauce). There are 5 ADD types *Delay [del] This Add is awarded to any move in which you catch (stall/delay) the footbag on either your foot or part of your leg. *DEXTERITY [dex] This Add is awarded when you circle around the footbag with your leg. *UNUSUAL SURFACE [uns] You get this Add when you use any surface of the body besides the toes, insteps, outsteps and knees. *BODY [bod] This ADD is awarded to any move which involves a spin, jump, or twist of your body. *CROSS BODY [xbd] This ADD is awarded to any move which involves a kick or delay done on the opposite side of your body. =ADD classification= If you are a player who can successfully combine multiple ADD level tricks in one \\"String\\" or \\"session\\" than your playing difficulty can be classed as follows. *2 ADDs = Tiltless *3 ADDs = Guiltless *4 ADDs = Tripless *5 ADDs = Fearless *6 ADDs = Beastly *7 ADDs = Godly  Freestyle trick fundamentals  =Kicks= There are 3 fundamental kicks that are used in freestyle. These kicks are: *Inside kick: Using the inside of your shoe. *Outside kick: Using the outside of your shoe. The Outside kick is also known as the gimp kick, fairy kick and al-weez kick. *Toe kick: Using the toe area of your shoe. =Stalls= Types of stall Once a player has mastered these tricks, they generally move on to stalling/delaying the footbag. This is where the footbag stops on part of the body. It is done to gain more control of the footbag, or to set up prior to a trick. Some of the simpler stalls found in freestyle are: *Toe stall: This is usually the first stall learned in footbag. The footbag is kicked or dropped in front of the body, and caught on the toe. *Inside stall: The footbag is caught on the inside of the foot. *Outside stall: The footbag is caught on the outside of the foot. *Clipper or Jester (Chester) stall: The kicking foot is positioned behind the standing foot, and caught on the inside of the foot as in an inside stall. the name jester is often used by circle kickers. =Basic Dexterities= *Around the World - Wrapping the leg around the bag in between toe stalls on same foot. *Switch - From toe stall to opposite toe stall, the leg goes out to in over the bag and catches the bag on the toe of the leg that circles the bag. *Pickup - From toe stall to opposite toe stall, the leg goes in to out under the bag and catches the bag on the toe of the leg that circles the bag. *Mirage - From toe stall back to the same toe, on the way down the opposite leg goes from in to out under the bag and catches the bag on the toe of the leg that does not circle the bag. *Down - On the way down, let the bag fall in between the legs while moving a leg from outside to in, letting it be caught on the opposite legs clipper stall (inside stall behind opposite support leg). This may be the most important move in footbag. It lays the foundation for more difficult moves. =Other Components= *Spins *Ducks *Symposium *Kneeing Move Elements =Combining Concepts= Spins can be added to dexterities to create moves like spinning down. =Acronyms and Jargon= Here is a list of various terms and concepts, these do not include actual trick names. *Alpine - A move that adds a duck, dive or weave between two dexterities *Backside - A move in which the downtime component is symposium *BS - Both Sides. Usually refers to hitting a move on both sides. Also sometimes used to denote Backside (see term) *BSOR - Both Sides One Run. Alternative way of saying BSOS (below) *BSOS - Both Sides One String. Refers to hitting a trick on both sides in one string. *Frontside - A move in which the uptime component is symposium *FS - Frontside (see term) *PDX - Short for Paradox *PS - Paradox-Symposium. A move that is both paradox AND symposium *The - Leg dexterities that do not fully circle the bags. 'The' dexterities do not count for adds *Thin - A move that was not hit cleanly but still technically hit.

The school was originally a graduate school, but began an undergraduate program in Fall 2010. On July 28, 2017, Steve Anderson was named as the new dean of the school. He succeeded Wynne Korr on September 15. Korr had served since 2002.https://news.illinois.edu/ii/02/0705/swdean.html History > In the late 1930s, the Public Welfare department of the state of Illinois > proposed that the University of Illinois develop a program for training in > social administration, similar to the programs developed at schools such as > the University of Wisconsin, the University of Iowa, and Northwestern > University. But by 1941, a portion of the Illinois program (along with other > schools‚Äô programs) had to be discontinued due to the strain of the war on > the University and its students. The University then hired a consultant from > the American Association of the Schools of Social Work to examine the > possibility of creating a social work school. The Association suggested that > for a school of social work to be successful, a full-time director, trained > in the field of social work, was needed. Marietta Stevenson, with a PhD in > political science and experience working for the American Public Welfare > Association, arrived in 1943 to head the University's new social work > division. Stevenson eventually renamed the program the School of Social > Work, and dedicated herself to building cooperative relationships with > social work agencies in order to provide fieldwork placement for students. > She even held classes at Chicago's Navy Pier so students could work in field > placements in the city‚Äôs more urban setting. Facilities The School of Social Work houses one building, located on Nevada Street in Urbana. Until 2009, the building used to be housed on Oregon Street. The current location is three blocks east of the Main Quadrangle, and a block east of Busey‚ÄìEvans Residence Halls.

He had moved to Canada with his family from Sri Lanka in 1994. Following the camping trip in Orillia, friends had suggested he should cut off the Prime Minister's head since he had enjoyed chopping wood so much. Described by Shaikh as \\"a few fries short of a happy meal\\", the youth had suggested that the group convert the Aboriginal peoples in Canada to Islam, and then offer them control of Quebec City and Montreal in exchange for killing Quebeckers.Pazzano, Sam. Toronto Sun, \\"Students' insults upset spy\\", July 4, 2008 At the trial, RCMP mole Mubin Shaikh was accused of \\"confecting evidence\\" in order to protect the youth by the crown prosecutor who made the rare move of labeling his own witness as hostile. The youth was accused of shoplifting camping gear from a Canadian Tire, and removing a spy-camera that had been placed outside the ringleader's apartment door by the police. He was sentenced to 2 years which was already served, and released in May 2009 although a DNA sample was taken and he was given 2 years probation and a 10-year prohibition against owning weapons. The publication ban was lifted after his guilt was determined. John Doe #1 John Doe #1, who was 15 years old at the time of the arrest, was a Grade 10 student at Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute in Toronto. He had converted to Islam from Hinduism several years earlier, upsetting his mother. He is said to have hung out with 19-year-old Amin Mohamed Durrani. His math textbook was taken by police as evidence. Sharing a room with his older brother, he was an avid soccer player, and hoped to grow up to become a veterinarian. He was often mentioning wanting a pet dog. He faked a school outing, as an excuse to attend a survival camp with another of the young offenders. He told his mother that he had nightmares and fears about deserting Islam, concerned that he would go to hell. He was denied bail on June 27, 2006, but was granted bail for C$15,000 on July 16, 2006 in another hearing, and was released to his parents. All charges against him were dropped on February 23, 2007.

The sperm is stored in spermathecae on the roof of the cloaca until it is needed at the time of oviposition.

Attachment behaviour anticipates a response by the attachment figure which will remove threat or discomfort\\".Prior & Glaser (2006) Understanding Attachment and Attachment Disorders, London: JKP, p.17Tronick, Morelli, & Ivey, 1992, p.568. \\"Until recently, scientific accounts ... of the infant's early social experiences converged on the view that the infant progresses from a primary relationship with one individual... to relationships with a growing number of people... This is an epigenetic, hierarchical view of social development. We have labeled this dominant view the continuous care and contact model (CCC...). The CCC model developed from the writings of Spitz..., Bowlby..., and Provence and Lipton... on institutionalized children and is represented in the psychological views of Bowlby...[and others]. Common to the different conceptual frameworks is the belief that parenting practices and the infant's capacity for social engagement are biologically based and conform to a prototypical form. Supporters of the CCC model generally recognize that the infant and caregiver are able to adjust to a range of conditions, but they consider the adjustments observed to reflect biological variation. However, more extreme views (e.g., maternal bonding) consider certain variants as nonadaptive and as compromising the child's psychological development. Bowlby's concept of monotropism is an exemplar of the CCC perspective...\\" (Tronick, Morelli, & Ivey, 1992, p. 568). Attachment also describes the function of availability, which is the degree to which the authoritative figure is responsive to the child's needs and shares communication with them. Childhood attachment can define characteristics that will shape the child's sense of self, their forms of emotion-regulation, and how they carry out relationships with others.Kayastha, P. (2010). Security of attachment in children and adolescents. Bangalore: Elsevier B.V. Attachment is found in all mammals to some degree, especially nonhuman primates. Attachment theory has led to a new understanding of child development. Children develop different patterns of attachment based on experiences and interactions with their caregivers at a young age. Four different attachment classifications have been identified in children: secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment. Attachment theory has become the dominant theory used today in the study of infant and toddler behavior and in the fields of infant mental health, treatment of children, and related fields.  Attachment theory and children  Attachment theory (Bowlby 1969, 1973, 1980) is rooted in the ethological notion that a newborn child is biologically programmed to seek proximity with caregivers, and this proximity-seeking behavior is naturally selected.Bowlby, J. (1969). Attachment and loss: Vol. I: Attachment. New York: Basic Books.Bowlby, J. (1973). Attachment and loss: Vol. II: Separation: Anxiety and anger. New York: Basic Books.Bowlby, J. (1980). Attachment and loss: Vol. III: Loss. New York: Basic Books. Through repeated attempts to seek physical and emotional closeness with a caregiver and the responses the child gets, the child develops an internal working model (IWM) that reflects the response of the caregiver to the child. According to Bowlby, attachment provides a secure base from which the child can explore the environment, a haven of safety to which the child can return when he or she is afraid or fearful. Bowlby's colleague Mary Ainsworth identified that an important factor which determines whether a child will have a secure or insecure attachment is the degree of sensitivity shown by their caregiver: The sensitive caregiver responds socially to attempts to initiate social interaction, playfully to his attempts to initiate play. She picks him up when he seems to wish it, and puts him down when he wants to explore. When he is distressed, she knows what kinds and degree of soothing he requires to comfort him ‚Äì and she knows that sometimes a few words or a distraction will be all that is needed. On the other hand, the mother who responds inappropriately tries to socialize with the baby when he is hungry, play with him when he is tired, or feed him when he is trying to initiate social interaction.Ainsworth, M. D. S. (1969) Ainsworth maternal scales. Available at http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/attachment/measures/content/ainsworth_scales.html However, it should be recognized that \\"even sensitive caregivers get it right only about 50 percent of the time. Their communications are either out of synch, or mismatched. There are times when parents feel tired or distracted. The telephone rings or there is breakfast to prepare. In other words, attuned interactions rupture quite frequently. But the hallmark of a sensitive caregiver is that the ruptures are managed and repaired.\\"  Attachment classification in children: the Strange Situation Protocol  William Blake's poem \\"Infant Joy\\" explores how to name a child and feel emotionally attached to it. This copy, Copy AA, printed and painted in 1826, is currently held by the Fitzwilliam Museum. The most common and empirically supported method for assessing attachment in infants (12 months ‚Äì 20 months) is the Strange Situation Protocol, developed by Mary Ainsworth as a result of her careful in- depth observations of infants with their mothers in Uganda(see below).Ainsworth, M.D.S., Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., & Wall, S. (1978). Patterns of attachment: A psychological study of the strange situation. Hillsdale, NJ: Earlbaum. The Strange Situation Protocol is a research, not a diagnostic, tool and the resulting attachment classifications are not 'clinical diagnoses.' While the procedure may be used to supplement clinical impressions, the resulting classifications should not be confused with the clinically diagnosed 'Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD).' The clinical concept of RAD differs in a number of fundamental ways from the theory and research driven attachment classifications based on the Strange Situation Procedure. The idea that insecure attachments are synonymous with RAD is, in fact, not accurate and leads to ambiguity when formally discussing attachment theory as it has evolved in the research literature. This is not to suggest that the concept of RAD is without merit, but rather that the clinical and research conceptualizations of insecure attachment and attachment disorder are not synonymous. The 'Strange Situation' is a laboratory procedure used to assess infant patterns of attachment to their caregiver. In the procedure, the mother and infant are placed in an unfamiliar playroom equipped with toys while a researcher observes/records the procedure through a one-way mirror. The procedure consists of eight sequential episodes in which the child experiences both separation from and reunion with the mother as well as the presence of an unfamiliar stranger. The protocol is conducted in the following format unless modifications are otherwise noted by a particular researcher: *Episode 1: Mother (or other familiar caregiver), Baby, Experimenter (30 seconds) *Episode 2: Mother, Baby (3 mins) *Episode 3: Mother, Baby, Stranger (3 mins or less) *Episode 4: Stranger, Baby (3 mins) *Episode 5: Mother, Baby (3 mins) *Episode 6: Baby Alone (3 mins or less) *Episode 7: Stranger, Baby (3 mins or less) *Episode 8: Mother, Baby (3 mins) Mainly on the basis of their reunion behaviours (although other behaviours are taken into account) in the Strange Situation Paradigm (Ainsworth et al., 1978; see below), infants can be categorized into three 'organized' attachment categories: Secure (Group B); Avoidant (Group A); and Anxious/Resistant (Group C). There are subclassifications for each group (see below). A fourth category, termed Disorganized (D), can also be assigned to an infant assessed in the Strange Situation although a primary 'organized' classification is always given for an infant judged to be disorganized. Each of these groups reflects a different kind of attachment relationship with the mother. A child may have a different type of attachment to each parent as well as to unrelated caregivers. Attachment style is thus not so much a part of the child's thinking, but is characteristic of a specific relationship. However, after about age five the child exhibits one primary consistent pattern of attachment in relationships. The pattern the child develops after age five demonstrates the specific parenting styles used during the developmental stages within the child. These attachment patterns are associated with behavioural patterns and can help further predict a child's future personality.  Attachment patterns  \\"The strength of a child's attachment behaviour in a given circumstance does not indicate the 'strength' of the attachment bond. Some insecure children will routinely display very pronounced attachment behaviours, while many secure children find that there is no great need to engage in either intense or frequent shows of attachment behaviour\\".Howe, D. (2011) Attachment across the lifecourse, London: Palgrave, p.13 = Secure attachment = A toddler who is securely attached to its parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status, however. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create securely attached children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.Schacter, D.L. et al. (2009). Psychology, Second Edition. New York: Worth Publishers. pp.441 In the traditional Ainsworth et al. (1978) coding of the Strange Situation, secure infants are denoted as \\"Group B\\" infants and they are further subclassified as B1, B2, B3, and B4. Although these subgroupings refer to different stylistic responses to the comings and goings of the caregiver, they were not given specific labels by Ainsworth and colleagues, although their descriptive behaviours led others (including students of Ainsworth) to devise a relatively 'loose' terminology for these subgroups. B1's have been referred to as 'secure-reserved', B2's as 'secure-inhibited', B3's as 'secure-balanced,' and B4's as 'secure-reactive.' In academic publications however, the classification of infants (if subgroups are denoted) is typically simply \\"B1\\" or \\"B2\\" although more theoretical and review-oriented papers surrounding attachment theory may use the above terminology. Securely attached children are best able to explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in how to cope with the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment can be seen as the most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment. = Anxious-resistant insecure attachment = Anxious- resistant insecure attachment is also called ambivalent attachment. In general, a child with an anxious-resistant attachment style will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the caregiver is present. When the caregiver departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when they return. The Anxious-Ambivalent/Resistant strategy is a response to unpredictably responsive caregiving, and that the displays of anger or helplessness towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.Crittenden, P. (1999) 'Danger and development: the organisation of self-protective strategies' in Atypical Attachment in Infancy and Early Childhood Among Children at Developmental Risk ed. Joan I. Vondra & Douglas Barnett, Oxford: Blackwell pp. 145-171 The C1 subtype is coded when: \\"...resistant behavior is particularly conspicuous. The mixture of seeking and yet resisting contact and interaction has an unmistakably angry quality and indeed an angry tone may characterize behavior in the preseparation episodes...\\" The C2 subtype is coded when: \\"Perhaps the most conspicuous characteristic of C2 infants is their passivity. Their exploratory behavior is limited throughout the SS and their interactive behaviors are relatively lacking in active initiation. Nevertheless, in the reunion episodes they obviously want proximity to and contact with their mothers, even though they tend to use signalling rather than active approach, and protest against being put down rather than actively resisting release...In general the C2 baby is not as conspicuously angry as the C1 baby.\\" = Anxious-avoidant insecure attachment = A child with the anxious-avoidant insecure attachment style will avoid or ignore the caregiver ‚Äì showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The child will not explore very much regardless of who is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorised that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants is in fact as a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants. Infants are depicted as anxious-avoidant insecure when there is: \\"...conspicuous avoidance of the mother in the reunion episodes which is likely to consist of ignoring her altogether, although there may be some pointed looking away, turning away, or moving away...If there is a greeting when the mother enters, it tends to be a mere look or a smile...Either the baby does not approach his mother upon reunion, or they approach in 'abortive' fashions with the baby going past the mother, or it tends to only occur after much coaxing...If picked up, the baby shows little or no contact-maintaining behavior; he tends not to cuddle in; he looks away and he may squirm to get down.\\" Ainsworth's narrative records showed that infants avoided the caregiver in the stressful Strange Situation Procedure when they had a history of experiencing rebuff of attachment behaviour. The child's needs are frequently not met and the child comes to believe that communication of needs has no influence on the caregiver. Ainsworth's student Mary Main theorised that avoidant behaviour in the Strange Situational Procedure should be regarded as 'a conditional strategy, which paradoxically permits whatever proximity is possible under conditions of maternal rejection' by de-emphasising attachment needs. Main proposed that avoidance has two functions for an infant whose caregiver is consistently unresponsive to their needs. Firstly, avoidant behaviour allows the infant to maintain a conditional proximity with the caregiver: close enough to maintain protection, but distant enough to avoid rebuff. Secondly, the cognitive processes organising avoidant behaviour could help direct attention away from the unfulfilled desire for closeness with the caregiver ‚Äì avoiding a situation in which the child is overwhelmed with emotion ('disorganised distress'), and therefore unable to maintain control of themselves and achieve even conditional proximity.Main, M. (1977a) Analysis of a peculiar form of reunion behaviour seen in some day-care children. In R. Webb (ed.) Social Development in Childhood (pp.33-78), Baltimore: Johns Hopkins = Disorganized/disoriented attachment = Ainsworth herself was the first to find difficulties in fitting all infant behaviour into the three classifications used in her Baltimore study. Ainsworth and colleagues sometimes observed 'tense movements such as hunching the shoulders, putting the hands behind the neck and tensely cocking the head, and so on. It was our clear impression that such tension movements signified stress, both because they tended to occur chiefly in the separation episodes and because they tended to be prodromal to crying. Indeed, our hypothesis is that they occur when a child is attempting to control crying, for they tend to vanish if and when crying breaks through'.Ainsworth, M.D., Blehar, M, Waters, E, & Wall, S. (1978) Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation, Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, p.282 Such observations also appeared in the doctoral theses of Ainsworth's students. Crittenden, for example, noted that one abused infant in her doctoral sample was classed as secure (B) by her undergraduate coders because her strange situation behaviour was \\"without either avoidance or ambivalence, she did show stress-related stereotypic headcocking throughout the strange situation. This pervasive behaviour, however, was the only clue to the extent of her stress\\".Crittenden, P.M. (1983) 'Mother and Infant Patterns of Attachment' Unpublished PhD Dissertation, University of Virginia, May 1983, p.73 Drawing on records of behaviours discrepant with the A, B, and C classifications, a fourth classification was added by Ainsworth's colleague Mary Main. In the Strange Situation, the attachment system is expected to be activated by the departure and return of the caregiver. If the behaviour of the infant does not appear to the observer to be coordinated in a smooth way across episodes to achieve either proximity or some relative proximity with the caregiver, then it is considered 'disorganised' as it indicates a disruption or flooding of the attachment system (e.g. by fear). Infant behaviours in the Strange Situation Protocol coded as disorganised/disoriented include overt displays of fear; contradictory behaviours or affects occurring simultaneously or sequentially; stereotypic, asymmetric, misdirected or jerky movements; or freezing and apparent dissociation. Lyons-Ruth has urged, however, that it should be wider 'recognized that 52% of disorganized infants continue to approach the caregiver, seek comfort, and cease their distress without clear ambivalent or avoidant behavior.' There is 'rapidly growing interest in disorganized attachment' from clinicians and policy-makers as well as researchers. Yet the Disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) classification has been criticised by some for being too encompassing.Svanberg, P.O. (2009). Promoting a secure attachment through early assessment and interventions. In J. Barlow & P.O. Svanberg (Eds.) Keeping the Baby in Mind, (pp. 100-114), London: Routledge. In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new 'D' classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as 'open- ended, in the sense that subcategories may be distinguished', as she worried that the D classification might be too encompassing and might treat too many different forms of behaviour as if they were the same thing.Ainsworth, M. (1990). 'Epilogue' in Attachment in the Preschool Years, ed. M.T. Greenberg, D. Ciccheti & E.M. Cummings. Chicago, IL: Chicago University Press, pp.463-488 Indeed, the D classification puts together infants who use a somewhat disrupted secure (B) strategy with those who seem hopeless and show little attachment behaviour; it also puts together infants who run to hide when they see their caregiver in the same classification as those who show an avoidant (A) strategy on the first reunion and then an ambivalent-resistant (C) strategy on the second reunion. Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of Disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a 'strategy of desperation' and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger).Solomon, J. & George, C. (1999a) The place of disorganisation in attachment theory. In Judith Solomon & Carol George (Eds) Attachment Disorganisation (pp3-32), p.27, NY: Guilford Crittenden also argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree. Sroufe et al. have agreed that 'even disorganised attachment behaviour (simultaneous approach-avoidance; freezing, etc.) enables a degree of proximity in the face of a frightening or unfathomable parent'.Sroufe, A. Egeland, B., Carlson, E. & Collins, W.A. (2005) The Development of the person: the Minnesota study of risk and adaptation from birth to adulthood, NY: Guilford Press, p.245 However, 'the presumption that many indices of \\"disorganisation\\" are aspects of organised patterns does not preclude acceptance of the notion of disorganisation, especially in cases where the complexity and dangerousness of the threat are beyond children's capacity for response'.Crittenden, P. (1999) 'Danger and development: the organisation of self-protective strategies' in Atypical Attachment in Infancy and Early Childhood Among Children at Developmental Risk ed. Joan I. Vondra & Douglas Barnett, Oxford: Blackwell pp. 159-160 For example, 'Children placed in care, especially more than once, often have intrusions. In videos of the Strange Situation Procedure, they tend to occur when a rejected/neglected child approaches the stranger in an intrusion of desire for comfort, then loses muscular control and falls to the floor, overwhelmed by the intruding fear of the unknown, potentially dangerous, strange person'.Crittenden, P. & Landini, A (2011) Assessing Adult Attachment: A Dynamic-Maturational Approach to Discourse Analysis, NY: W.W. Norton, p.269 Main and Hesse found that most of the mothers of these children had suffered major losses or other trauma shortly before or after the birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed. In fact, 56% of mothers who had lost a parent by death before they completed high school subsequently had children with disorganized attachments. Subsequently, studies, whilst emphasising the potential importance of unresolved loss, have qualified these findings. For example, Solomon and George found that unresolved loss in the mother tended to be associated with disorganised attachment in their infant primarily when they had also experienced an unresolved trauma in their life prior to the loss.Solomon, J., & George, C. (2006). Intergenerational transmission of dysregulated maternal caregiving: Mothers describe their upbringing and child rearing. In O. Mayseless (Ed). Parenting representations: Theory, research, and clinical implications (pp. 265-295) Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. = Later patterns and the dynamic-maturational model = Studies of older children have identified further attachment classifications. Main and Cassidy observed that disorganized behaviour in infancy can develop into a child using caregiving-controlling or punitive behaviour in order to manage a helpless or dangerously unpredictable caregiver. In these cases, the child's behaviour is organised, but the behaviour is treated by researchers as a form of 'disorganization' (D) since the hierarchy in the family is no longer organised according to parenting authority. Patricia McKinsey Crittenden has elaborated classifications of further forms of avoidant and ambivalent attachment behaviour. These include the caregiving and punitive behaviours also identified by Main and Cassidy (termed A3 and C3 respectively), but also other patterns such as compulsive compliance with the wishes of a threatening parent (A4).Crittenden, P.M. (2008) Raising Parents: Attachment, Parenting and Child Safety, London: Routledge Crittenden's ideas developed from Bowlby's proposal that 'given certain adverse circumstances during childhood, the selective exclusion of information of certain sorts may be adaptive. Yet, when during adolescence and adult the situation changes, the persistent exclusion of the same forms of information may become maladaptive'.Bowlby, J. (1980) Loss, London: Penguin, p.45 Crittenden proposed that the basic components of human experience of danger are two kinds of information: # 'Affective information' ‚Äì the emotions provoked by the potential for danger, such as anger or fear. Crittenden terms this 'affective information'. In childhood this information would include emotions provoked by the unexplained absence of an attachment figure. Where an infant is faced with insensitive or rejecting parenting, one strategy for maintaining the availability of their attachment figure is to try to exclude from consciousness or from expressed behaviour any emotional information that might result in rejection. # Causal or other sequentially ordered knowledge about the potential for safety or danger. In childhood this would include knowledge regarding the behaviours that indicate an attachment figure's availability as a secure haven. If knowledge regarding the behaviours that indicate an attachment figure's availability as a secure haven is subject to segregation, then the infant can try to keep the attention of their caregiver through clingy or aggressive behaviour, or alternating combinations of the two. Such behaviour may increase the availability of an attachment figure who otherwise displays inconsistent or misleading responses to the infant's attachment behaviours, suggesting the unreliability of protection and safety. Crittenden proposes that both kinds of information can be split off from consciousness or behavioural expression as a 'strategy' to maintain the availability of an attachment figure: 'Type A strategies were hypothesized to be based on reducing perception of threat to reduce the disposition to respond. Type C was hypothesized to be based on heightening perception of threat to increase the disposition to respond'p.435 in Type A strategies split off emotional information about feeling threatened and type C strategies split off temporally-sequenced knowledge about how and why the attachment figure is available. By contrast, type B strategies effectively use both kinds of information without much distortion. For example: a toddler may have come to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in working to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour. This may lead their attachment figure to get a clearer grasp on their needs and the appropriate response to their attachment behaviours. Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, the toddler then no longer needs to use coercive behaviours with the goal of maintaining their caregiver's availability and can develop a secure attachment to their caregiver since they trust that their needs and communications will be heeded. = Significance of patterns = Research based on data from longitudinal studies, such as the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and the Minnesota Study of Risk and Adaption from Birth to Adulthood, and from cross-sectional studies, consistently shows associations between early attachment classifications and peer relationships as to both quantity and quality. Lyons-Ruth, for example, found that 'for each additional withdrawing behavior displayed by mothers in relation to their infant's attachment cues in the Strange Situation Procedure, the likelihood of clinical referral by service providers was increased by 50%.' Secure children have more positive and fewer negative peer reactions and establish more and better friendships. Insecure-ambivalent children have a tendency to anxiously but unsuccessfully seek positive peer interaction whereas insecure-avoidant children appear aggressive and hostile and may actively repudiate positive peer interaction. On only a few measures is there any strong direct association between early experience and a comprehensive measure of social functioning in early adulthood but early experience significantly predicts early childhood representations of relationships, which in turn predicts later self and relationship representations and social behaviour. Studies have suggested that infants with a high-risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) may express attachment security differently from infants with a low-risk for ASD. Behavioural problems and social competence in insecure children increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in quality of parenting and the degree of risk in the family environment.  Criticism of the Strange Situation Protocol Michael Rutter describes the procedure in the following terms: left > \\"It is by no means free of limitations (see Lamb, Thompson, Gardener, > Charnov & Estes, 1984). To begin with, it is very dependent on brief > separations and reunions having the same meaning for all children. This may > be a major constraint when applying the procedure in cultures, such as that > in Japan (see Miyake et al., 1985), where infants are rarely separated from > their mothers in ordinary circumstances.Miyake, Chen, & Campos (1985). > Infant temperament and mother's mode of interaction and attachment in Japan; > an interim report; In I.

This global distribution was generally consistent with Ainsworth et al.'s (1978) original attachment classification distributions. However, controversy has been raised over a few cultural differences in these rates of 'global' attachment classification distributions. In particular, two studies diverged from the global distributions of attachment classifications noted above. One study was conducted in North Germany in which more avoidant (A) infants were found than global norms would suggest, and the other in Sapporo, Japan, where more resistant (C) infants were found. Of these two studies, the Japanese findings have sparked the most controversy as to the meaning of individual differences in attachment behaviour as originally identified by Ainsworth et al. (1978). In a recent study conducted in Sapporo, Behrens et al. (2007) found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main & Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification. In addition to these findings supporting the global distributions of attachment classifications in Sapporo, Behrens et al. also discuss the Japanese concept of amae and its relevance to questions concerning whether the insecure- resistant (C) style of interaction may be engendered in Japanese infants as a result of the cultural practice of amae. A separate study was conducted in Korea, to help determine if mother-infant attachment relationships are universal or culture-specific. The results of the study of infant-mother attachment were compared to a national sample and showed that the four attachment patterns, secure, avoidance, ambivalent, and disorganized, exist in Korea as well as other varying cultures. Van IJzendoorn and Kroonenberg conducted a meta-analysis of various countries, including Japan, Israel, Germany, China, the UK and the USA using the Strange Situation. The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the four basic patterns, secure, avoidance, ambivalent, and disorganized can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm. Selection of the secure pattern is found in the majority of children across cultures studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies. How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken. = Discrete or continuous attachment measurement = Regarding the issue of whether the breadth of infant attachment functioning can be captured by a categorical classification scheme, continuous measures of attachment security have been developed which have demonstrated adequate psychometric properties. These have been used either individually or in conjunction with discrete attachment classifications in many published reports. The original Richter's et al. (1998) scale is strongly related to secure versus insecure classifications, correctly predicting about 90% of cases. Readers further interested in the categorical versus continuous nature of attachment classifications (and the debate surrounding this issue) should consult a paper by Fraley and Spieker and the rejoinders in the same issue by many prominent attachment researchers including J. Cassidy, A. Sroufe, E. Waters & T. Beauchaine, and M. Cummings.  See also   References   Recommended reading  * Cassidy, J., & Shaver, P., (Eds).

This was a series of concerts featuring Queen, The Clash, the Pretenders, The Who, Elvis Costello, Wings, and many more artists which took place at the Hammersmith Odeon in London, England during December 1979 to raise money for the victims of war-torn Cambodia. The event was organized by McCartney and Kurt Waldheim, and it involved older artists such as McCartney and The Who as well as younger new wave acts like The Clash and the Pretenders. The last of the concerts was the last concert of Wings. Most of the Rockestra wore silver suits for this performance. On the Concerts for Kampuchea home video, McCartney can be heard making a comment about Townshend before playing the song, making reference to Townshend being a \\"poof\\" (gay in British slang). \\"Thank you, Peter. Only lousy sod who wouldn't wear the silver suit.

His musical repertoire included traditional English and Scottish ballads, Appalachian folk songs and original compositions. Biography Nimrod Workman was born in Inez, Martin County, Kentucky and was named after his grandfather, \\"a full-blooded Cherokee Indian who fought in the Civil War and who taught his namesake the old ballads from Britain about lords and ladies and the ancient Scottish wars\\". At the age of 14, he went to work in the Howard Collieries coal mines in Mingo County, West Virginia, and he continued working as a coal miner for forty-two years until he was forced to retire due to black lung and a slipped disc. His wife, Mollie Bowens, was of Italian descent on her mother's side. The couple had thirteen children. Throughout his coal mining career, Workman was active in union politics and United Mine Workers of America organizing. In 1920‚Äì1921 he worked alongside the union activist Mary Harris \\"Mother\\" Jones in West Virginia, and participated in the Battle of Blair Mountain uprising. In later years, he advocated on behalf of black lung victims, and was able to receive union compensation for his own health problems in 1971. Following his retirement as a miner he became known as a folk singer, with frequent performances around Appalachia as well as the Smithsonian Folklife Festival and the 1982 World's Fair. He was also filmed by archivist and ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax. Workman recorded two albums, Passing Thru the Garden, with his daughter Phyllis Boyens, which was released by June Appal Recordings in 1975. In 1978, he released Mother Jones' Will on the Rounder Records label. In addition, he contributed songs to several albums of traditional and coal mining music. He was the subject of the documentary Nimrod Workman: To Fit My Own Category, produced by Appalshop Films, and appeared as himself in the documentaries Harlan County, USA, Chase the Devil: Religious Music of the Appalachians, and The Grand Generation.\\" He is heard leading the singing of \\"Amazing Grace\\" in the funeral scene in Coal Miner's Daughter, which also featured Phyllis Boyens as Loretta Lynn's mother. Workman was a recipient of a 1986 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. He spent most of his life in Chattaroy, West Virginia, though in later years he lived in Mascot, Tennessee. He died in Knoxville, Tennessee at the age of 99.

It is currently owned and operated by The Ohio State University and licensed to serve Granville, Ohio, United States. History Originally WDUB and owned by Denison University, the station began as an AM \\"carrier current\\" radio station on November 12, 1953 at 7 a.m. with the Star Spangled Banner, but ceased broadcasting for a brief period of time in the 1960s, while the building that had housed its studios was being replaced. In 1969, the FCC authorized WDUB to return to the air with a 10-watt signal at 90.9 FM. During the 1970s, WDUB broadcast about 17 hours of programming per day, including open-format music, local sports, and extensive news and special events programming. Stereo broadcasting was introduced in 1975. In the 1980s and 1990s, the station devoted its resources primarily to music, increased its power to 100 watts, increased its hours of operation, and changed its frequency to its current dial position. In the fall of 2004, WDUB began a second era of its history as the station began streaming its on-air content worldwide. During the summer of 2005, the station went through an entire digital upgrade of the main sound board, studio interconnects, catalog, recording, and record keeping functions. Over 100 DJs volunteered to broadcast about one show per week. The open format allowed for each DJ to broadcast whatever type of music he or she preferred. The station aspired to feature 24-hour broadcasting, with shows going all night and day. Popularity WDUB was consistently ranked as one of America's most popular college radio stations by The Princeton Review (#20 in 2008) (#18 in 2011) (#18 in 2012) . The station was also featured in American Eagle stores nationwide from June to September in 2009. . Most recently, WDUB was ranked 17th in The Princeton Review's list of best college radio stations ahead of the release of their 2015 guide. Events The first annual \\"Doobiepalooza\\", a 91.1 WDUB sponsored event, occurred on May 3, 2014. The event showcased student musicians and artists. In fall 2014, WDUB debuted two new logos, a Swasey Chapel logo and a \\"boombox\\" logo, both created by students as part of a logo creation contest. Alumni Numerous Denison University graduates have used their WDUB experience as an entry into the field of commercial broadcasting. Notable former DJs include actor Steve Carell and former Cleveland Browns CEO Joe Banner. Transfer to Ohio State On September 1, 2019, the station went silent after the students decided to move solely to an Internet radio format. The switch occurred due to changes made by the FCC, with which WDUB was having trouble complying. On December 11, 2019, Denison University filed paperwork with the FCC to transfer the signal to The Ohio State University for $5,000, on-air announcements for four years, and paid student internships. The sale was consummated on February 24, 2020, at which point the station changed its call sign to WOSX. As part of the sale, Denison University retained the WDUB call sign. On March 2, 2020, WOSX changed its format to a mix of news, talk, and classical music.http://radioinsight.com/headlines/184738/wosu-network-to-move-to-mix-of- news-classical/ References External links WDUB Banner Logo 2014-2020 OSX OSX Radio stations established in 1962 1962 establishments in Ohio ","title":"WOSX"},{"id":"5761682","text":"Armando may refer to: * Armando (given name) * Armando (artist) (1929‚Äì2018), the name used by Dutch artist Herman Dirk van Dodeweerd * Armando (producer) (1970‚Äì1996), Chicago house producer * Armando (album), studio album by rapper Pitbull * Armando (Planet of the Apes), a fictional character ","title":"Armando"},{"id":"5761688","text":"Bir Protik Akbar Hossain (18 January 1941 ‚Äì 25 June 2006) was a Bangladeshi politician of Bangladesh National Party.

Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938 (1995), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States on who decides whether a dispute is subject to arbitration, the courts or an arbitrator. Background Under the 1924 U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and subsequent Supreme Court rulings, there is a strong presumption in favor of arbitration, with the courts generally deferring to the opinions of an arbitrator. Deciding Who Decides Questions of Arbitrability: A Survey of American Law and a Comparative Perspective This case arose out of disputes over a \\"workout\\" agreement, embodied in four documents, which governed the \\"working out\\" of debts to First Options of Chicago, Inc. incurred as a result of the October 1987 stock market crash (and later losses) by Manuel Kaplan, his wife, and his wholly owned investment company, MK Investments, Inc. (MKI). First Options is a firm that clears stock trades on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. When First Options' demands for payment went unsatisfied, it sought arbitration by a stock exchange panel. MKI, which had signed the only workout document containing an arbitration agreement, submitted to arbitration, but the Kaplans, who had not signed that document, filed objections with the panel, denying that their disagreement with First Options was arbitrable. The arbitrators decided that they had the power to rule on the dispute's merits and ruled in First Options' favor. The District Court confirmed the award, but the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. The Third Circuit said that courts should independently decide whether an arbitration panel has jurisdiction over a dispute, and that it would apply ordinary standards of review when considering the District Court's denial of the Kaplan's' motion to vacate the arbitration award. Supreme Court holdings The Court unanimously agreed with the Third Circuit that arbitrability of the Kaplan--First Options dispute was subject to independent review by the courts. On the narrow question of whether the arbitrators or the courts have the primary power to decide whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a dispute's merits, the Court held that just as the arbitrability of the merits of a dispute depends upon whether the parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute, so the question \\"who has the primary power to decide arbitrability\\" turns upon whether the parties agreed to submit that question to arbitration. If so, then the court should defer to the arbitrator's arbitrability decision. If not, then the court should decide the question independently. These answers flow inexorably from the fact that arbitration is simply a matter of contract between the parties. Courts generally should apply ordinary state law principles governing contract formation in deciding whether such an agreement exists. However, courts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is \\"clear and unmistakable\\" evidence that they did so. The Court also held that courts of appeals should apply ordinary standards when reviewing district court decisions upholding arbitration awards, i.e., accepting findings of fact that are not \\"clearly erroneous\\" but deciding questions of law de novo; they should not, in those circumstances, apply a special \\"abuse of discretion\\" standard.

A meuni√®re sauce is a simple preparation‚Äîbrown butter, chopped parsley, and lemon‚Äîand the name refers to its unelaborate rustic nature. Preparation There are two primary ways to prepare the fish (most popularly, sole or trout). One is by saut√©ing‚Äîfirst dredging the fish in seasoned flour (white flour or corn flour) and then cooking in a hot saut√© pan with a small amount of clarified butter. The alternative method is to pan-fry or deep fry the floured fish. In pan frying, oil or a combination of oil and butter is used‚Äîup to perhaps 2 cm deep. Deep frying is done in either a large fry pot or in a stand-alone deep fryer. The floured fish is completely submerged in the hot oil. The frying techniques result in a crisper texture, but the sauce will need to be made separately. The saut√©ed fish will have a softer skin by comparison, but allows for the possibility of creating the sauce √† la minute after the fish has been removed by adding fresh butter, parsley, and lemon. Meuni√®re sauce is a variation on a brown butter sauce. While there is general agreement on the addition of parsley and lemon, some chefs have been known to include ingredients such as Worcestershire sauce, red wine vinegar, or beef stock. Another common variation is to use pecans rather than almonds in an amandine.

History In April 1952, two local school districts, Orland District 221 and Palos District 222 were consolidated into Consolidated High School District 230, for the express purpose of constructing a new high school. This new high school would replace an older high school which had been run by the Orland district at one of its grammar schools, along with rented space around the town for history, English, home economics, and science classes. The new school was designed to serve 450 students. The site of the school was an old corn field, which at the time was surrounded by a forest preserve, a lake, and a golf course. A school board resolution called for the new school to be named for Carl Sandburg, out of \\"a desire for historic significance transcending purely local associations of the former school districts\\". In April 1953, it was announced that the new high school building would be named for the poet, after Sandburg \\"consented and expressed his pleasure\\" in a letter to the school board. At least until 1960, Sandburg visited the school every other year. Ground breaking took place on the US$930,000 structure on May 17, 1953. The school was designed to be a one-story structure with a central gymnasium/auditorium capable of holding 1,200 people. A smaller two story section was to house agriculture, science and business education classes as well as the school's library. The school was built with the specific intent to build additions on to the building as the student population grew. The school opened for classes in September 1954. The school was formally dedicated on October 10, 1954, with the school's namesake in attendance. The district saw enormous growth, growing from 186 high school students just prior to the construction of the new school, to a projected population of over 900 for the 1956‚Äì57 school year. In the summer of 1956, construction began on the first major addition to the school; an addition that more than doubled the school's size. The 1956‚Äì57 school year also saw students attend in split shifts to alleviate the overcrowding that was already occurring. A second gym, primarily for use by girls, was opened ahead of the rest of the addition in January 1958. The remainder of the new addition was ready in May 1958, expanding the school's capacity to 1,700 students. The original administration offices became the new book store, while the addition itself contained new classrooms and administrative offices, as well as expanded room for the music and industrial technology classes. No sooner was the new addition occupied, when, in the autumn of 1958, the school board issued a bond referendum to raise over US $1 million to further expand the school, and to purchase property for the site of a future high school. This second addition, finished for the 1960‚Äì61 school year, included ten new classrooms, a new library (the old library was subdivided to make new classrooms) and the school's first swimming pool. The next bond issue came in 1966; this time a US$3.5 million request from the electorate to finance additions at Sandburg and its now sister school, Stagg High School. As a result, Sandburg saw more science laboratories as well as rooms for art, music, and industrial arts training. The first time Carl Sandburg visited Carl Sandburg High School in his home state of Illinois he was mistaken for a bum off the street and promptly ordered to leave the premises. School officials quickly learned their mistake. Sandburg, it is said, was gracious and extremely considerate through the whole thing. When Carl Sandburg died in 1967, the school's choir performed at the official memorial tribute, held at the Chicago Public Library. Academics In 2005, Sandburg had an average composite ACT score of 22.3 and graduated 98.1% of its senior class. The average class size is 19.2. Sandburg has made Adequate Yearly Progress on the Prairie State Achievements Examination, a state test part of the No Child Left Behind Act. Additionally, it has scored a 90.3 on the State Test Performance Index. Sandburg has been named one of Newsweek's top 1,000 schools on several occasions. * 2003, Sandburg was ranked 607 * 2005, Sandburg was ranked 744 * 2006, Sandburg was ranked 967 =Advanced Placement= The school has a 38% Advanced Placement (AP) participation rate and boasts a 79% pass rate. The average test taker takes 3.8 exams.https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high- schools/illinois/districts/cons-hsd-230/carl-sandburg-high-school-6527 Students can choose from more than a dozen different AP courses to take during high school. Options include Calculus, Chemistry, U.S. History, Spanish Language, and others. Student life =Activities= Carl Sandburg High School is home to numerous different co-curricular activities. The debate team has won seven state championships and ranked nationally in the Public Forum style of debate. The team has also qualified teams for the prestigious Tournament of Champions hosted annually at the University of Kentucky. The debate team joins hand-in hand with the likewise successful speech team to represent the Carl Sandburg Forensics Team, which ranks, \\"27 out of more than 3,000 schools nationwide\\" with the combined skills of two groups. The speech team has won three state championships in the past three years alone. Both the Carl Sandburg High School debate team and speech team are recognized by the National Speech and Debate Association (formerly the National Forensics League). The Model United Nations club hosts an annual conference and competes at conferences across the country. Carl Sandburg High School currently has five bands, all co-curricular. Directed by Stewart Bailey and Brian Hillhouse, they include the entry level Varsity Band, intermediate Symphonic Band II, and the top Symphonic Band I, in addition to Percussion Band II and Percussion Band I. Sandburg also has a marching band with the typical high-school band brass, woodwind and percussion sections, in addition to color guard, a group that is included with the marching Eagles, but perform with flags, rifles, and sabers. In early December 2008, the Sandburg Marching Eagles were selected to perform in the 56th Presidential Inaugural Parade in Washington D.C. and the color guard was also displayed with a performance. The Carl Sandburg Marching Eagles were also chosen to perform during half-time in the 2016 Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana as well as the Sugar Bowl New Year's Eve Parade. Carl Sandburg High School also has three levels of orchestras directed by Dr. Linda Nussbaum. In order from most to least advanced, they are Symphony, Philharmonic, and Concert Orchestra. The department is also home to the co- curricular Quartet Furioso, a group consisting of the four most prestigious players in the Symphony Orchestra. The school currently has five curricular choirs and one co-curricular a capella group. Directed by Ms. Nicole Denofrio, they include: Freshman Choir, Concert Choir, Cantabile, Bel Canto, and Chorale (formerly Varsity Singers). Chamber Singers (also Accidentals and Eloquence), is an eighteen-member a capella group that performs at many locations around the community, occasionally alongside the Quartet Furioso. The District also has a Relay For Life event that donates money towards the American Cancer Society. In 2011, the Relay For Life of District 230 raised nearly $413,000. This placed them first in the state of youth events and boosted the event to the second largest all-youth event in the country. This second in the nation was only behind one large university, Virginia Tech. The Relay has been going on for the past 14 years and was the first event of its kind in the country. =Athletics= Sandburg competes in the Southwest Suburban Conference (SWSC) and is a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA), which governs most sports and competitive activities in the state of Illinois. School teams are stylized as the \\"Eagles\\". Carl Sandburg High School state championship sign at the intersection of 131st St. and LaGrange Rd. The school sponsors interscholastic teams for young men and women in basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, gymnastics, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field, volleyball, and water polo. Young men may compete in baseball, football, and wrestling, while young women may compete in badminton, cheerleading, and softball. While not sponsored by the IHSA, the school's athletic department also sponsors a poms team. Sandburg's cross country and track teams have been extremely successful and was home to world champion athlete Lukas Verzbicas. Verzbicas won the Gatorade Boys' Cross Country Runner of the Year award his junior and senior seasons. In addition, Verzbicas won the Nike and Foot Locker national championship and went on to run at the University of Oregon. Another member of the cross country team, Pat McMahon, was awarded the prestigious $20,000 Foot Locker scholarship in the Spring of 2013. The following teams have placed in the top four of their respective IHSA sponsored state championship tournament or meet. * Badminton (girls): State Champions (2010‚Äì11) * Baseball: State Champions (2001‚Äì02) * Basketball (girls): 4th place (1997‚Äì98) * Cheerleading: 3rd place (2007‚Äì08, 2009-10, 2016‚Äì17); State Champions (2005‚Äì06, 2008‚Äì09, 2011‚Äì12) * Cross Country (boys): 4th place (1981‚Äì82, 2006‚Äì07) 2nd place (2014‚Äì15) 1st Place (2015‚Äì16) * Cross Country (girls): 4th place (2001‚Äì02); 3rd place (2002‚Äì03); 2nd place (1997‚Äì98, 2009-10) * Football: semifinals (1993‚Äì94) * Gymnastics (girls): 4th place (1996‚Äì97, 2000‚Äì01); 3rd place (1994‚Äì95); 2nd place (2008‚Äì09) * Soccer (boys): 3rd place (1994‚Äì95, 2012‚Äì13); State Champions (1993‚Äì94, 2001‚Äì02, 2002‚Äì03) * Soccer (girls): 3rd place (2008‚Äì09); 2nd place (1995‚Äì96, 2000‚Äì01) * Softball: State Champions (2009‚Äì2010); 4th place (1993‚Äì94, 1998‚Äì99, 2001‚Äì02); 3rd place (1992‚Äì93, 1999‚Äì2000, 2005‚Äì06); 2nd place (2000‚Äì01) * Swimming and Diving (boys): 4th place (2011‚Äì12) * Track & Field (boys): 3rd place (1976‚Äì77) 3rd place (2015‚Äì16) * Volleyball (boys): 2nd place (1996‚Äì97, 2000‚Äì01); State Champions (1995‚Äì96, 1998‚Äì99, 1999‚Äì2000, 2010‚Äì11) * Volleyball (girls): 3rd place (1980‚Äì81); 2nd place (1981‚Äì82, 2001‚Äì02); State Champions (1998‚Äì99) * Water Polo (boys): 4th place (2007‚Äì08, 2010‚Äì11); 2nd place (2008‚Äì09) * Wrestling: 2nd place (1966‚Äì67, 2009‚Äì10); State Champions (2004‚Äì05, 2005‚Äì06, 2006‚Äì07, 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13) Notable alumni * Jeff Alm (1986) was an NFL defensive lineman (1990‚Äì93), playing entire career with Houston Oilers. * Sandra G.

It is the second oldest of the nine original Dioceses of the Episcopal Church. Services began in 1685 at St. Peter's, Perth Amboy, the oldest parish in the diocese. The diocese itself was founded in 1785. The diocese originally included all of the state of New Jersey, but was divided in 1874, when the northern third of the state split off to form the Diocese of Northern New Jersey, which was later renamed to become the Diocese of Newark. The Diocese of New Jersey has the sixth-largest number of parishes in the Episcopal Church, and the eighth-largest number of baptized communicants. It has a reputation for broad ethnic and socio-economic diversity. The Diocese of New Jersey currently has a total of 141 congregations. The diocese is under the jurisdiction of William H.

History Announced to the public in August 1995, Gamezero.com the Analog Joystick was released to the public in Japan in early April 1996. Maru-Chang.com Features The Analog Joystick used potentiometer technology previously used on consoles such as the Vectrex; instead of relying on binary eight-way switches, the controller can detect minute angular changes through the entire range of motion. The stick also features a thumb-operated digital hat switch on the right joystick, corresponding to the traditional D-pad, and used for instances when simple digital movements were necessary. A compatibility mode for the Analog Joystick was included in the Dual Analog Controller, Sony's first analog revision of its original gamepad design. PS1 games that support the PS1 Analog Joystick have an \\"Analog Joystick Compatible\\" icon on the back cover. The Analog Joystick has a switch to select either Analog or Digital mode.

Other reviewers were not quite as kind: \\"This solo debut from the Bozzio Levin Stevens guitarist is quite entertaining. As anyone who's listened to either BLS album might expect, there's a large serving of really fast Spanish guitar picking on here, and a lot of it is really melodic and quite beautiful.

The company licenses its name to manufacturers of roughly 200 products made using its raw material. TerraCycle also manages Loop, a consumer products shopping service with reusable packaging.  History  = 2001‚Äì03: Founding and investments = TerraCycle was founded by Tom Szaky and Jon Beyer in the fall of 2001. In 2002, the company bought a US$20,000 continuous-flow composting system invented by Harry Windle of Gainesville, Florida, to take organic waste and have it processed by worms into fertilizer. The dining halls of Princeton University were the first sources of waste used. Initial funding came from family and friends of Tom Szaky and Jon Beyer, as well as awards from business plan competitions. TerraCycle received media attention when it turned down a one million dollar venture investment opportunity awarded through the Carrot Capital Business Plan because the investors planned to change TerraCycle's business model. Further funding came from private investors. The first investor was Suman Sinha, who gave $2,000 in exchange for 1% of the company stock. = 2004‚Äì06: Vermicompost = upright=0.5 Instead of pure fertilizer, TerraCycle sold its products in liquid form. The company made this decision upon concluding that liquid fertilizer could have better consumer reception, as well as production advantages. The original purpose for packing its liquid fertilizer in used plastic bottles was because the company could not afford new ones. Later, the company continued this process and marketed their gardening products as \\"Waste in Waste\\". Schools and local organizations collected bottles for TerraCycle in exchange for proceeds in what became known as the \\"Bottle Brigade\\". Maintaining intellectual property rights, The Coca-Cola Company gave TerraCycle a license to use its bottles in TerraCycle products. PepsiCo also gave TerraCycle a license to use its distinctively shaped bottles. In 2004‚Äì5, Home Depot Canada and Wal-Mart Canada began carrying TerraCycle products. Other companies followed. During its growth, the company bought an abandoned mansion to house its interns and a warehouse for its fertilizer production and offices. = 2007: Scotts Miracle- Gro lawsuit = The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company sued TerraCycle in 2007, claiming false advertising and trade dress violations. In response, TerraCycle started a media campaign known as \\"suedbyscotts.com\\". Scotts claimed that TerraCycle's choice of colors was too similar to its own products. Scotts eventually dropped the case upon an agreement with TerraCycle to alter TerraCycle's product packaging. TerraCycle agreed to recolor its packaging to orange and green as well as remove pictures of fruits and vegetables on its labels. Issues over product comparison claims on TerraCycle's packaging were also resolved. In the settlement, Scotts required TerraCycle to host a copy of the agreement on suedbyscotts.com. = 2007‚Äìpresent: Sponsored Waste and Beyond= In 2007, TerraCycle developed waste solutions and Brigade collection programs for Honest Tea, Stonyfield Farm, and Kraft Foods. Seth Goldman, founder and CEO of Honest Tea, asked Szaky for a waste solution to its Honest Kids brand. As Tom Szaky himself designed sample products for the aluminum- plastic pouches, including pencil pouches and tote bags, Goldman agreed to sponsor the Drink Pouch Brigade. Upon deals with Safeway, Target, and Walgreens to buy the products, TerraCycle acquired approximately 20 million baled juice pouches stored by Encorp in British Columbia, Canada, which contained many Capri-Sun pouches. Because of intellectual property and trademark rights, TerraCycle sought out permission from Kraft to use Capri-Sun brand pouches in its products. They obtained additional sponsorship for the Drink Pouch Brigade as well. Programs for other Kraft brands, such as Oreo and Chips Ahoy, soon followed. The same year, co-founder Jon Beyer left TerraCycle to work at another company, Princeton Asset Management Group. In 2008, TerraCycle partnered with Target to sell recycled Target plastic shopping bags fused together as reusable bags named \\"reTotes\\". At the end of the year, TerraCycle lost $4.5 million. As a result, the company changed its manufacturing processes to use pre-consumer extra and misprinted packaging labels from other companies in its upcycled products. TerraCycle changed to use the majority of its collected post-consumer waste for recycling into plastic molding pellets. Around 2008, it ended its Bottle Brigade program. = 2009: Launch to the European market = TerraCycle launched in the UK in September 2009 (its first market in Europe) and today operates in 12 European markets (UK, Republic of Ireland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Sweden and Denmark). In the UK, TerraCycle currently runs collection programmes for cracker biscuit and cake wrappers, crisp, nuts, pretzels and popcorn packets, baby food pouches, Pringles cans, writing instruments, air and home care waste, toothbrushes and toothpaste tubes, Aqua Optima water filters, pet food packaging, contact lenses, personal care and beauty products / packaging, Tassimo & L‚ÄôOR coffee pod / TDISC waste and cigarette waste. To date in the UK, TerraCycle's programmes have diverted over 57 million items of packaging waste from landfill (around the weight of a jumbo jet) while earning over ¬£744,000 for schools, charities and non-profit organisations By 2009, TerraCycle moved away from manufacturing to licensing all of its products. As of the same year, it outsourced its vermicompost production to worm farmers in North Carolina. From 2012, TerraCycle and various tobacco companies partnered to launch a widespread collection and recycling system for cigarette butts. The cigarette filters, generally made from cellulose acetate, are refined into pellets that are then used in the production of plastic items such as shipping pallets, benches, and ashtrays. The company promises that the recycled plastic from cigarette filters will only be used in industrial products and not in household plastics, due to exposure to nicotine. The recycled cellulose acetate is mixed with other recycled plastics to create usable industrial products. Tobacco and paper are composted in this program. It took six months for the development of the process required to recycle cigarette butts. On January 29, 2014, Progressive Waste Solutions announced a 19.99% interest acquisition in TerraCycle Canada to cooperate on recycling initiatives in Canada. In October 2016, TerraCycle and Suez Environment announced that Suez acquired 30% of TerraCycle's European operations to develop collection and recycling programs in Europe. At the World Economic Forum in January 2017, TerraCycle, Procter & Gamble and Suez announced production of the world's first recyclable shampoo bottle made from plastic recovered from beaches, rivers and waterways for the Head & Shoulders brand. The first bottles went on sale in France in June 2017 and in October the project was recognized by the United Nations as a winner of a Momentum For Change Lighthouse Activities Award. Products and services TerraCycle has created approximately 200 products, all of which are licensed to manufacturers, instead of being manufactured by TerraCycle itself. TerraCycle began with the production of fertilizer made from vermicompost, which is produced by feeding organic waste to worms. The worms' excrement was then liquefied into \\"compost tea\\" by mixing it with air and warm water in large vats. It was packaged in reused plastic water bottles. The spray bottle tops were rejects from other companies. Residue left over from the vats was used in potting soil and seed starter products. Capri-Sun juice pouches.alt= The company diversified its production into upcycling around 2007 and began creating products from other waste items. For example, it makes coin pouches and tablet cases from retired U.S. Postal Service bags. Various products are produced from pre-consumer waste and post-consumer waste, including messenger and tote bags. Plastic packaging waste, that is not upcycled, is recycled into a raw material that can be used in plastic products, including playgrounds, plastic lumber, plastic pavers, bike racks, park benches, and garbage and recycling cans. TerraCycle's recycling programs enable individuals or groups to collect specified waste materials in exchange for donations to a selected cause or school. Users sign up over the Internet, and shipping and donation costs are generally covered by a sponsoring company related to the specified recycling program. The waste materials, typically non-recyclable, are either refurbished, upcycled, or recycled. At the World Economic Forum in 2019, TerraCycle unveiled Loop, a closed-loop reusable packaging platform for consumer packaged goods companies. The system ships via UPS a variety of food, household cleaning, personal care products in a reusable padded container. The products are dispensed from reusable metal and plastic containers, which are returned in the same container when empty. Criticism TerraCycle keeps its branding prominent on its partner's recycled products. This has raised concern that consumers could think of the brands themselves as \\"green\\" or \\"eco- friendly\\" while the product is probably only \\"upcyclable\\", not fully recyclable. TerraCycle products are not recyclable any further. TerraCycle has also been criticized by some people for the relatively small volume of material it collects for recycling in comparison to the total amount of such packaging that is produced by manufacturers each year, while noting that in the US, after over 40 years of regulations requiring recycling of materials (glass, paper, rigid plastic and certain metals), recycling rates are under 35% where recycling is economically viable. Corporate identity =Logo= According to Tom Szaky, the name TerraCycle \\"came up at the beginning [as] the idea of 'earth' and 'cycle'.\\" Szaky thought up the name with another Princeton University student during a road trip from New Jersey to Florida. The TerraCycle company logo is a green infinity symbol with two arrows pointed toward one another. Szaky designed the logo during a lecture at Princeton. =Television show= TerraCycle was the subject of a National Geographic reality television series named Garbage Moguls. The pilot premiered on Earth Day, April 22, 2009. The show featured the TerraCycle team searching for solutions to various waste streams. In 2014, now defunct Pivot launched Human Resources, a reality TV series providing a behind-the-scenes look at day-to- day operations at TerraCycle's headquarters. =Web game= TerraCycle partnered with game developer Guerillapps to make a Facebook-based flash game known as Trash Tycoon. The game was launched in 2011, and it mimics TerraCycle's actual business model. Major sponsors for the game include Carbonfund.org and Treehugger.com. Revenue is generated through the inclusion of brand logos within the game and the use of virtual currency. TerraCycle receives 25% of the advertising revenue but none of the virtual currency revenue. The game donates 10% of its revenues to Carbonfund.org. In the game, players take on the roles of recycling entrepreneurs who perform actions, such as upcycling and composting. Avatars collect litter from the streets, completing missions to earn points. The game features synchronized multiplayer play. Corporate affairs The front of TerraCycle's headquarters. An inside view of the TerraCycle office in Trenton, New Jersey. =Headquarters= TerraCycle's main headquarters are located in Trenton, New Jersey. The office was originally a abandoned warehouse for a newspaper distribution facility. The headquarters were purchased by TerraCycle in the summer of 2004. Its renovations were done by TerraCycle's internal design team, led by employee Tiffany Threadgould, and its walls are painted annually by local graffiti artists at \\"Graffiti Jams\\". =Finances= As of 2013, TerraCycle maintains a one percent profit margin. Tom Szaky reported TerraCycle sales in 2004 as $77,000; 2005 as $500,000; 2006 as $1.6 million; 2007 as $3.3 million; 2008 as $6.6 million; 2009 as $7.3 million; and 2010 as $13.5 million. The company hit $19.3 million in 2016 and expects to surpass $20 million in 2017. In fall 2017, TerraCycle US Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of TerraCycle, Inc., announced it has filed for a Regulation A offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that allows anyone the opportunity to invest in the recycling company's U.S. subsidiary.

It is home to the Churchill Falls Generating Station and is a company town. History John McLean is believed to have been the first European to see the falls in 1839. In 1967, work on the generating station had commenced, officially inaugurated by Premier Joey Smallwood, while residential facilities also began that year. The town was built around a town complex, the Donald Gordon Centre, with amenities such as a school, gymnasium, grocery store, hotel, restaurant, library, curling club and swimming pool. Permanent housing facilities were constructed in 1969. The town is managed and operated by Nalcor Energy and remains a company town to this date. Geography Churchill Falls lies on the Churchill River near the Churchill Falls, one of the largest waterfalls in Canada. It is about 245 kilometres east of Labrador City. =Climate= Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, Churchill Falls has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with long, cold winters and short, mild summers. Demographics Churchill Falls is a part of the Division No. 10, Subdivision D. As of the 2016 census, it had a population of 705. There were a total of 369 private dwellings. The population was spread out, with 160 being from age 0 to 14, 530 from age 15 to 64, and 10 being age 65 or older. The average age was 32.4. English was the mother tongue of 695 residents, while French was the mother tongue of the remaining 10. A total of 40 residents claimed to be of First Nations heritage, while 60 were M√©tis and 15 were Inuit.  Transportation  Churchill Falls is connected by the Trans-Labrador Highway with Labrador City and Baie-Comeau in Quebec. The Churchill Falls Airport serves the community. There were scheduled flights to Goose Bay and Wabush in the 1970s.Airport Divestiture Status Report Sports and recreation The Terry Smith Memorial Arena, named after a longtime resident, is one of the most popular facilities in town. The Churchill Falls Gymnasium serves the needs of the Eric G. Lambert School as well as badminton and hockey teams. The curling club is based at the Donald Gordon Center. There are also soccer fields and a swimming pool in the community.

It is marked by swelling at the knee, which can be tender to the touch and which generally does not restrict the knee's range of motion. It can be extremely painful and disabling as long as the underlying condition persists. Prepatellar bursitis is most commonly caused by trauma to the knee, either by a single acute instance or by chronic trauma over time. As such, the condition commonly occurs among individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling. A definitive diagnosis can usually be made once a clinical history and physical examination have been obtained, though determining whether or not the inflammation is septic is not as straightforward. Treatment depends on the severity of the symptoms, with mild cases possibly only requiring rest and localized icing. Options for presentations with severe sepsis include intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.  Signs and symptoms  Lateral section of the knee The primary symptom of prepatellar bursitis is swelling of the area around the kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly. The area may be red (erythema), warm to the touch, or surrounded by cellulitis, particularly if infection is present, often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, except in severe cases prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee, though it may cause some discomfort in complete flexion of the joint. Flexion and extension of the knee may be accompanied by crepitus, the audible grating of bones, ligaments, or particles within the excess synovial fluid.  Causes  In human anatomy, a bursa is a small pouch filled with synovial fluid. Its purpose is to reduce friction between adjacent structures. The prepatellar bursa is one of several bursae of the knee joint, and is located between the patella and the skin. Prepatellar bursitis is an inflammation of this bursa. Bursae are readily inflamed when irritated, as their walls are very thin. Along with the pes anserine bursa, the prepatellar bursa is one of the most common bursae to cause knee pain when inflamed. Prepatellar bursitis is caused by either a single instance of acute trauma to the knee, or repeated minor trauma to the knee. The trauma can cause extravasation of nearby fluids into the bursa, which stimulates an inflammatory response. This response occurs in two phases: The vascular phase, in which the blood flow to the surrounding area increases, and the cellular phase, in which leukocytes migrate from the blood to the affected area. Other possible causes include gout, sarcoidosis, CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, uremia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some cases are idiopathic, though these may be caused by trauma that the patient does not remember. The prepatellar bursa and the olecranon bursa are the two bursae that are most likely to become infected, or septic. Septic bursitis typically occurs when the trauma to the knee causes an abrasion, though it is also possible for the infection to be caused by bacteria traveling through the blood from a pre-existing infection site. In approximately 80% of septic cases, the infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus; other common infections are Streptococcus, Mycobacterium, and Brucella. It is highly unusual for septic bursitis to be caused by anaerobes, fungi, or Gram-negative bacteria. In very rare cases, the infection can be caused by tuberculosis.  Diagnosis  There are several types of inflammation that can cause knee pain, including sprains, bursitis, and injuries to the meniscus. A diagnosis of prepatellar bursitis can be made based on a physical examination and the presence of risk factors in the person's medical history; swelling and tenderness at the front of the knee, combined with a profession that requires frequent kneeling, suggest prepatellar bursitis. Swelling of multiple joints along with restricted range of motion may indicate arthritis instead. A physical examination and medical history are generally not enough to distinguish between infectious and non- infectious bursitis; aspiration of the bursal fluid is often required for this, along with a cell culture and Gram stain of the aspirated fluid. Septic prepatellar bursitis may be diagnosed if the fluid is found to have a neutrophil count above 1500 per microliter, a threshold significantly lower than that of septic arthritis (50,000 cells per microliter). A tuberculosis infection can be confirmed using a radiograph of the knee and urinalysis.  Prevention  It is possible to prevent the onset of prepatellar bursitis, or prevent the symptoms from worsening, by avoiding trauma to the knee or frequent kneeling. Protective knee pads can also help prevent prepatellar bursitis for those whose professions require frequent kneeling and for athletes who play contact sports, such as American football, basketball, and wrestling. Treatment Non-septic prepatellar bursitis can be treated with rest, the application of ice to the affected area, and anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly ibuprofen. Elevation of the affected leg during rest may also expedite the recovery process. Severe cases may require fine-needle aspiration of the bursa fluid, sometimes coupled with cortisone injections. However, some studies have shown that steroid injections may not be an effective treatment option. After the bursitis has been treated, rehabilitative exercise may help improve joint mechanics and reduce chronic pain. Opinions vary as to which treatment options are most effective for septic prepatellar bursitis. McAfee and Smith recommend a course of oral antibiotics, usually oxacillin sodium or cephradine, and assert that surgery and drainage are unnecessary. Wilson-MacDonald argues that oral antibiotics are \\"inadequate\\", and recommends intravenous antibiotics for managing the infection. Some authors suggest surgical irrigation of the bursa by means of a subcutaneous tube. Others suggest that bursectomy may be necessary for intractable cases; the operation is an outpatient procedure that can be performed in less than half an hour.  Epidemiology  The various nicknames associated with prepatellar bursitis arise from the fact that it commonly occurs among those individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling, such as carpenters, carpet layers, gardeners, housemaids, mechanics, miners, plumbers, and roofers. The exact incidence of the condition is not known; it is difficult to estimate because only severe septic cases require hospital admission, and mild non-septic cases generally go unreported. Prepatellar bursitis is more common among males than females. It affects all age groups, but is more likely to be septic when it occurs in children.

The species is endemic to the southern United States and northeastern and central Mexico. Five subspecies are recognized as being valid, including the nominotypical subspecies, Micrurus tener tener, which is found in both the US and Mexico, and is also commonly known as the Texas coral snake. The species Micrurus tener was once considered to be a subspecies of the eastern coral snake (Micrurus fulvius). Geographic range USA coral snake range M. tener ranges from the southern United States south to northeastern and central Mexico. It inhabits the states of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tamaulipas, San Luis Potos√≠, Guanajuato, Quer√©taro and Morelos. Description The Texas coral snake has the traditional coloration associated with coral snakes: black, yellow, and red rings. It is capable of growing to 48 in (122 cm) in total length (including tail), but most are closer to .Powell R, Conant R, Collins JT (2016). Peterson Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Fourth Edition. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. xiv + 494 pp., 47 plates, 207 Figures. . (Micrurus tener, pp. 434-435, Figure 196 + Plate 44). Males are typically smaller than females. It has smooth dorsal scales, a rounded head, and the eyes have round pupils. Albinistic (lacking black pigment) and anerythristic (lacking red pigment) specimens have been found in the wild. \\"Pastel\\" (pink, translucent cream, and very light blue) coloration has been noted, and completely black (melanistic) specimens, are known. The Texas coral snake is somewhat larger (longer and stouter) than the eastern coral snake (Micrurus fulvius), and has a somewhat larger venom yield. Behavior All coral snakes are shy, secretive animals, typically nocturnal. They spend most of their time hiding in leaf litter, under logs. They can be seen crawling on the surface, after heavy rains, when the nighttime temperatures rise above . When grabbed suddenly, or sometimes just when touched, they may thrash about, swing around, and bite. Sometimes they are calm, and then suddenly swing around and bite, for no apparent reason. Diet The primary diet of M. tener consists of other snakes, primarily earth snakes, and other small fossorial species. It is cannibalistic. It also occasionally eats small lizards, but the consumption of rodents by coral snakes is rare. Reproduction M. tener is oviparous. Mimicry Other nonvenomous snakes resemble the Texas coral snake as a form of Batesian mimicry. In the United States ONLY, all three species of venomous coral snakes (Micruroides euryxanthus, Micrurus fulvius, and Micrurus tener ) can be identified by the red rings contacting the yellow rings. A common mnemonic device is \\"red and yellow, kill a fellow\\". Venom Texas coral snake venom is a powerful neurotoxin, causing neuromuscular dysfunction. Until 2006, no deaths from coral snake bites had been reported since the 1970s in the United States. However, rare, fatal bites have occurred according to several scientific journals in the '80s and '90s. Because of the low profits, the production of coral snake antivenin has been discontinued for several years.Breen, David (2013). \\"Risk from coral-snake bites grows as antivenin dwindles\\".

Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer, produced antivenin for the eastern coral snake, which can also be used for treatment of envenomation by the Texas coral snake. However, the last lot produced (Lot L67530) has an expiration date of January 31, 2020.\\"Expiration Date Extension for North American Coral Snake Antivenin (Micrurus fulvius) (Equine Origin) Lot L67530 through January 31, 2020\\".

A coral snake (genus Micrurus) is proteroglyphous, meaning it has a pair of deeply grooved, semihollow, chisel-shaped, fixed fangs in the front of its upper jaw, through which the venom is injected and encouraged via a chewing motion. Coral snakes do not necessarily need to bite and hold on for a brief time to deliver a significant amount of venom. They expel venom quickly during extraction into collection media in the lab. Severe envenomations have occurred after a quick bite. Many bites from coral snakes do not inject any venom at all (dry bite). A bite from any coral snake should be considered an extremely serious medical emergency, and medical treatment should be sought immediately, because symptoms of envenomation are known to sometimes delay manifestation for as long as 24 hours, but once present, often progress very rapidly. Subspecies The five recognized subspecies of M. tener are: *M. t. tener *M. t. fitzingeri *M. t. maculatus *M. t. microgalbineus *M. t. tamaulipensis Nota bene: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than Micrurus. M. t. tener is found in both the US and Mexico, whereas the other subspecies are endemic to Mexico. Etymology The subspecific name, fitzingeri, is in honor of Austrian herpetologist Leopold Fitzinger.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Micrurus tener fitzingeri, p. 91). Taxonomy The Texas coral snake was once considered a subspecies of the eastern coral snake, Micrurus fulvius, but more recent research has determined that it has enough morphological differences to be considered its own species.

Microbial genetics studies microorganisms for different purposes. The microorganisms that are observed are bacteria, and archaea. Some fungi and protozoa are also subjects used to study in this field. The studies of microorganisms involve studies of genotype and expression system. Genotypes are the inherited compositions of an organism. (Austin, \\"Genotype,\\" n.d.) Genetic Engineering is a field of work and study within microbial genetics. The usage of recombinant DNA technology is a process of this work. The process involves creating recombinant DNA molecules through manipulating a DNA sequence. That DNA created is then in contact with a host organism. Cloning is also an example of genetic engineering. Since the discovery of microorganisms by Robert Hooke and Antoni van Leeuwenhoek during the period 1665-1885 they have been used to study many processes and have had applications in various areas of study in genetics. For example: Microorganisms' rapid growth rates and short generation times are used by scientists to study evolution. Robert Hooke and Antoni van Leeuwenhoek discoveries involved depictions, observations, and descriptions of microorganisms. Mucor is the microfungus that Hooke presented and gave a depiction of. His contribution being, Mucor as the first microorganism to be illustrated. Antoni van Leeuwenhoek‚Äôs contribution to the microscopic protozoa and microscopic bacteria yielded to scientific observations and descriptions. These contributions were accomplished by a simple microscope, which led to the understanding of microbes today and continues to progress scientists understanding. Microbial genetics also has applications in being able to study processes and pathways that are similar to those found in humans such as drug metabolism.  Role in understanding evolution  Microbial genetics can focus on Charles Darwin's work and scientists have continued to study his work and theories by the use of microbes. Specifically, Darwin's theory of natural selection is a source used. Studying evolution by using microbial genetics involves scientists looking at evolutionary balance. An example of how they may accomplish this is studying natural selection or drift of microbes. Application of this knowledge comes from looking for the presence or absence in a variety of different ways. The ways include identifying certain pathways, genes, and functions. Once the subject is observed, scientist may compare it to a sequence of a conserved gene. The process of studying microbial evolution in this way lacks the ability to give a time scale of when the evolution took place. However, by testing evolution in this way, scientist can learn the rates and outcomes of evolution. Studying the relationship between microbes and the environment is a key component to microbial genetics evolution. Microorganisms whose study is encompassed by microbial genetics =Bacteria= Bacteria are classified by their shape. Bacteria have been on this planet for approximately 3.5 billion years, and are classified by their shape. Bacterial genetics studies the mechanisms of their heritable information, their chromosomes, plasmids, transposons, and phages. Gene transfer systems that have been extensively studied in bacteria include genetic transformation, conjugation and transduction. Natural transformation is a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer between two cells through the intervening medium. The uptake of donor DNA and its recombinational incorporation into the recipient chromosome depends on the expression of numerous bacterial genes whose products direct this process. In general, transformation is a complex, energy-requiring developmental process that appears to be an adaptation for repairing DNA damage. Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells. Bacterial conjugation has been extensively studied in Escherichia coli, but also occurs in other bacteria such as Mycobacterium smegmatis. Conjugation requires stable and extended contact between a donor and a recipient strain, is DNase resistant, and the transferred DNA is incorporated into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination. E. coli conjugation is mediated by expression of plasmid genes, whereas mycobacterial conjugation is mediated by genes on the bacterial chromosome. Transduction is the process by which foreign DNA is introduced into a cell by a virus or viral vector. Transduction is a common tool used by molecular biologists to stably introduce a foreign gene into a host cell's genome. =Archaea= Archaea is a domain of organisms that are prokaryotic, single- celled, and are thought to have developed 4 billion years ago. \\"They have no cell nucleus or any other organelles inside their cells.\\"Archaea replicate asexually in a process known as binary fission. The cell division cycle includes when chromosomes of daughter cells replicate. Because archea have a singular structure chromosome, the two daughter cells separate and cell divides. Archaea have motility include with flagella, which is a tail like structure. Archaeal chromosomes replicate from different origins of replication, producing two haploid daughter cells. \\" They share a common ancestor with bacteria, but are more closely related to eukaryotes in comparison to bacteria. Some Archaea are able to survive extreme environments, which leads to many applications in the field of genetics. One of such applications is the use of archaeal enzymes, which would be better able to survive harsh conditions in vitro. Gene transfer and genetic exchange have been studied in the halophilic archaeon Halobacterium volcanii and the hyperthermophilic archaeons Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. H. volcani forms cytoplasmic bridges between cells that appear to be used for transfer of DNA from one cell to another in either direction. When S. solfataricus and S. acidocaldarius are exposed to DNA damaging agents, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced. Cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange and genetic recombination with high frequency. Cellular aggregation is thought to enhance species specific DNA transfer between Sulfolobus cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination. Archaea are divided into 3 subgroups which are halophiles, methanogens, and thermoacidophiles. The first group, methanogens, are archaeabacteria that live in swamps and marshes as well as in the gut of humans. They also play a major role in decay and decomposition with dead organisms. Methanogens are anaerobic organisms, which are killed when they are exposed to oxygen. The second subgroup of archaeabacteria, halophiles are organisms that are present in areas with high salt concentration like the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. The third subgroup thermoacidophiles also called thermophiles, are organisms that live in acidic areas. They are present in area with low pH levels like hot springs and geyers. Most thermophiles are found in the Yellowstone National Park. Archaeal Genetics is the study of genes that consist of single nucleus-free cells. Archaea have a single, circular chromosomes that contain multiple origins of replication for initiation of DNA synthesis. DNA replication of Archaea involves similar processes including initiation, elongation, and termination. The primase used to synthesize a RNA primer varies than in eukaryotes. The primase by archaea is highly derived version of RNA recognition motif(RRM). Archaea come from Gram positive bacteria, which both have a single lipid bilayer, which are resistant to antibiotics. Archaea are similar to mitochondria in eukaryotes in that they release energy as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the chemical reaction called metabolism. Some archaea known as phototrophic archaea use the sun‚Äôs energy to produce ATP. ATP synthase is used as photophosphorylation to convert chemicals into ATP. Archaea and bacteria are structurally similar even though they are not closely related in the tree of life. The shapes of both bacteria and archaea cells vary from a spherical shape known as coccus or a rod-shape known as bacillus. They are also related with no internal membrane and a cell wall that assists the cell maintaining its shape. Even though archaeal cells have cells walls, they do not contain peptidoglycan, which means archaea do not produce cellulose or chitin. Archaea are most closely related to eukaryotes due to tRNA present in archaea, but not in bacteria. Archaea have the same ribosomes as eukaryotes that synthesize into proteins. Aside from the morphology of archaea and bacteria, there are other differences between these domains. Archaea that live in extreme and harsh environments with low pH levels such as salt lakes, oceans, and in the gut of ruminants and humans are also known as extremophiles. In contrast, bacteria are found in various areas such as plants, animals, soil, and rocks. =Fungi= Fungi can be both multicellular and unicellular organisms, and are distinguished from other microbes by the way they obtain nutrients. Fungi secrete enzymes into their surroundings, to break down organic matter. Fungal genetics uses yeast, and filamentous fungi as model organisms for eukaryotic genetic research, including cell cycle regulation, chromatin structure and gene regulation. Studies of the fungus Neurospora crassa have contributed substantially to understanding how genes work. N. crassa is a type of red bread mold of the phylum Ascomycota. It is used as a model organism because it is easy to grow and has a haploid life cycle that makes genetic analysis simple since recessive traits will show up in the offspring. Analysis of genetic recombination is facilitated by the ordered arrangement of the products of meiosis in ascospores. In its natural environment, N. crassa lives mainly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. It often can be found growing on dead plant matter after fires. Neurospora was used by Edward Tatum and George Beadle in their experiments for which they won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1958. The results of these experiments led directly to the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis that specific genes code for specific proteins. This concept proved to be the opening gun in what became molecular genetics and all the developments that have followed from that. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a yeast of the phylum Ascomycota. During vegetative growth that ordinarily occurs when nutrients are abundant, S. cerevisiae reproduces by mitosis as diploid cells. However, when starved, these cells undergo meiosis to form haploid spores. Mating occurs when haploid cells of opposite mating types MATa and MATŒ± come into contact. Ruderfer et al. pointed out that, in nature, such contacts are frequent between closely related yeast cells for two reasons. The first is that cells of opposite mating type are present together in the same acus, the sac that contains the cells directly produced by a single meiosis, and these cells can mate with each other. The second reason is that haploid cells of one mating type, upon cell division, often produce cells of the opposite mating type. An analysis of the ancestry of natural S. cerevisiae strains concluded that outcrossing occurs very infrequently (only about once every 50,000 cell divisions). The relative rarity in nature of meiotic events that result from outcrossing suggests that the possible long-term benefits of outcrossing (e.g. generation of diversity) are unlikely to be sufficient for generally maintaining sex from one generation to the next. Rather, a short term benefit, such as meiotic recombinational repair of DNA damages caused by stressful conditions (such as starvation) may be the key to the maintenance of sex in S. cerevisiae. Candida albicans is a diploid fungus that grows both as a yeast and as a filament. C. albicans is the most common fungal pathogen in humans. It causes both debilitating mucosal infections and potentially life-threatening systemic infections. C. albicans has maintained an elaborate, but largely hidden, mating apparatus. Johnson suggested that mating strategies may allow C. albicans to survive in the hostile environment of a mammalian host. Among the 250 known species of aspergilli, about 33% have an identified sexual state. Among those Aspergillus species that exhibit a sexual cycle the overwhelming majority in nature are homothallic (self-fertilizing). Selfing in the homothallic fungus Aspergillus nidulans involves activation of the same mating pathways characteristic of sex in outcrossing species, i.e. self-fertilization does not bypass required pathways for outcrossing sex but instead requires activation of these pathways within a single individual. Fusion of haploid nuclei occurs within reproductive structures termed cleistothecia, in which the diploid zygote undergoes meiotic divisions to yield haploid ascospores. =Protozoa= Protozoa are unicellular organisms, which have nuclei, and ultramicroscopic cellular bodies within their cytoplasm. One particular aspect of protozoa that are of interest to human geneticists are their flagella, which are very similar to human sperm flagella. Studies of Paramecium have contributed to our understanding of the function of meiosis. Like all ciliates, Paramecium has a polyploid macronucleus, and one or more diploid micronuclei. The macronucleus controls non-reproductive cell functions, expressing the genes needed for daily functioning. The micronucleus is the generative, or germline nucleus, containing the genetic material that is passed along from one generation to the next. In the asexual fission phase of growth, during which cell divisions occur by mitosis rather than meiosis, clonal aging occurs leading to a gradual loss of vitality. In some species, such as the well studied Paramecium tetraurelia, the asexual line of clonally aging paramecia loses vitality and expires after about 200 fissions if the cells fail to undergo meiosis followed by either autogamy (self-fertilization) or conjugation (outcrossing) (see aging in Paramecium). DNA damage increases dramatically during successive clonal cell divisions and is a likely cause of clonal aging in P. tetraurelia. When clonally aged P. tetraurelia are stimulated to undergo meiosis in association with either autogamy or conjugation, the progeny are rejuvenated, and are able to have many more mitotic binary fission divisions. During either of these processes the micronuclei of the cell(s) undergo meiosis, the old macronucleus disintegrates and a new macronucleus is formed by replication of the micronuclear DNA that had recently undergone meiosis. There is apparently little, if any, DNA damage in the new macronucleus, suggesting that rejuvenation is associated with the repair of these damages in the micronucleus during meiosis. =Viruses= Viruses are capsid-encoding organisms composed of proteins and nucleic acids that can self-assemble after replication in a host cell using the host's replication machinery. There is a disagreement in science about whether viruses are living due to their lack of ribosomes. Comprehending the viral genome is important not only for studies in genetics but also for understanding their pathogenic properties. Many types of virus are capable of genetic recombination. When two or more individual viruses of the same type infect a cell, their genomes may recombine with each other to produce recombinant virus progeny. Both DNA and RNA viruses can undergo recombination. When two or more viruses, each containing lethal genomic damage infect the same host cell, the virus genomes often can pair with each other and undergo homologous recombinational repair to produce viable progeny. This process is known as multiplicity reactivation.http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Faculty/Michod/Downloads/IGE%20review%20sex.pdf Enzymes employed in multiplicity reactivation are functionally homologous to enzymes employed in bacterial and eukaryotic recombinational repair. Multiplicity reactivation has been found to occur with pathogenic viruses including influenza virus, HIV-1, adenovirus simian virus 40, vaccinia virus, reovirus, poliovirus and herpes simplex virus as well as numerous bacteriophages. Any living organism can contract a virus by giving parasites the opportunity to grow. Parasites feed on the nutrients of another organism which allows the virus to thrive. Once the human body detects a virus, it then creates fighter cells that attack the parasite/virus; literally, causing a war within the body. A virus can affect any part of the body causing a wide range of illnesses such as the flu, the common cold, and sexually transmitted diseases. The flu is an airborne virus that travels through tiny droplets and is formally known as Influenza. Parasites travel through the air and attack the human respiratory system. People that are initially infected with this virus pass infection on by normal day to day activity such as talking and sneezing. When a person comes in contact with the virus, unlike the common cold, the flu virus affects people almost immediately. Symptoms of this virus are very similar to the common cold but much worse. Body aches, sore throat, headache, cold sweats, muscle aches and fatigue are among the many symptoms accompanied by the virus. A viral infection in the upper respiratory tract results in the common cold. With symptoms like sore throat, sneezing, small fever, and a cough, the common cold is usually harmless and tends to clear up within a week or so. The common cold is also a virus that is spread through the air but can also be passed through direct contact. This infection takes a few days to develop symptoms; it is a gradual process unlike the flu. Applications of microbial genetics Taq polymerase which is used in Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR) Microbes are ideally suited for biochemical and genetics studies and have made huge contributions to these fields of science such as the demonstration that DNA is the genetic material, that the gene has a simple linear structure, that the genetic code is a triplet code, and that gene expression is regulated by specific genetic processes. Jacques Monod and Fran√ßois Jacob used Escherichia coli, a type of bacteria, in order to develop the operon model of gene expression, which lay down the basis of gene expression and regulation. Furthermore, the hereditary processes of single- celled eukaryotic microorganisms are similar to those in multi-cellular organisms allowing researchers to gather information on this process as well. Another bacterium which has greatly contributed to the field of genetics is Thermus aquaticus, which is a bacterium that tolerates high temperatures. From this microbe scientists isolated the enzyme Taq polymerase, which is now used in the powerful experimental technique, Polymerase chain reaction(PCR). Additionally the development of recombinant DNA technology through the use of bacteria has led to the birth of modern genetic engineering and biotechnology. Using microbes, protocols were developed to insert genes into bacterial plasmids, taking advantage of their fast reproduction, to make biofactories for the gene of interest. Such genetically engineered bacteria can produce pharmaceuticals such as insulin, human growth hormone, interferons and blood clotting factors. These biofactories are typically much cheaper to operate and maintain than the alternative procedures of producing pharmaceuticals. They're like millions of tiny pharmaceutical machines that only require basic raw materials and the right environment to produce a large amount of product. The utilization of incorporating the human insulin gene alone has had profound impacts on the medical industry. It is thought that biofactories might be the ultimate key in reducing the price of expensive life saving pharmaceutical compounds. Microbes synthesize a variety of enzymes for industrial applications, such as fermented foods, laboratory test reagents, dairy products (such as renin), and even in clothing (such as Trichoderma fungus whose enzyme is used to give jeans a stone washed appearance). There is currently potential for microbes to be used as an alternative for petroleum- based surfactants. Microbial surfactants would still have the same kind of hydrophillic and hydrophobic functional groups as their petroleum-based counterparts, but they have numerous advantages over their competition. In comparison, microbial amphiphillic compounds have robust a tendency to stay functional in extreme environments such as areas with high heat or extreme ph. all while being biodegradable and less toxic to the environment. This efficient and cheap method of production could be the solution to the ever increasing global consumption of surfactants. Ironically, the application for bio-based surfactants with the most demand is the oil industry which uses surfactants in general production as well as development of specific oil compositions. Microbes are an abundant source of lipases which have a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications. Enzymes perform a wide variety of functions inside the cells of living things, so it only makes sense that we can use them for similar purposes on a larger scale. Microbial enzymes are typically preferred for mass production due to the wide variety of functions available and their ability to be mass produced. Plant and animal enzymes are typically too expensive to be mass-produced, however this is not always the case. Especially in plants. Industrial applications of lipases generally include the enzyme as a more efficient and cost-effective catalyst in the production of commercially valuable chemicals from fats and oils, because they are able to retain their specific properties in mild easy to maintain conditions and work at an increased rate. Other already successful applications of lipolytic enzymes include the production of biofuels, polymers, non-stereoisomeric pharmaceuticals, agricultural compounds, and flavor-enhancing compounds. In regards to industrial optimization, the benefit of the biofactory method of production is the ability to direct optimization by means of directed evolution. The efficiency and specificity of production will increase over time by imposing artificial selection. This method of improving efficiency is nothing new in agriculture, but it's a relatively new concept in industrial production. It is thought that this method will be far superior to conventional industrial methods because you have optimization on multiple fronts. The first front being that the microorganisms that make up biofactories can be evolved to our needs. The second front being the conventional method of optimization brought about by the integration of advancing technologies. This combination of conventional and biological advancement is just now becoming utilized and provides a virtually limitless number of applications.

At the federal elections of 1984 and 1987 it ran candidates, but on both occasions these candidates (who included former Liberal cabinet minister Bill Wentworth) did poorly. The group was designed to represent the elderly vote, advocating issues dealing with aged care and a mature perspective on national policy; hence the name \\"grey power\\". The party's state president in New South Wales was Robert Clark, an anti- immigration campaigner and the founder of the Immigration Control Association, which advocated for a return to the White Australia policy. In 1989 the party's deputy president resigned in protest at the \\"abhorrent literature ... anti-Asian, anti-Jews, anti-everyone\\" that had been circulated at party meetings. Grey Power ran in the 1989 Western Australian state election, garnering 5.2% of the total lower house vote. However after the election a \\"bitter power struggle\\" emerged which resulted in the \\"virtual collapse\\" of the party in Western Australia. Police were called to the annual meeting of the party at a suburban hall in Dalkeith. The Canberra Times observed in 1989 that the party \\"remains fractured, with, as yet, little unity of purpose among state organisations\\" and noted that the movement had been \\"dogged by allegations of links with right wing or racist groups\\". The last election which Grey Power contested was the 1997 South Australian state election, but then it only managed to receive 1.6% of the South Australian Legislative Council vote. Their preferences however significantly contributed to the election of Nick Xenophon. The best result Grey Power ever achieved was at the 1994 Taylor state by-election in South Australia. Without a Liberal candidate in the running on this occasion, Grey Power took 13 percent of the primary vote and finished second after preferences had been distributed with a 27 percent two-candidate preferred vote.

History Plaza Mayor in Madrid As Italian Baroque influences penetrated across the Pyrenees, they gradually superseded in popularity the restrained classicizing approach of Juan de Herrera, which had been in vogue since the late sixteenth century. As early as 1667, the facades of Granada Cathedral (by Alonso Cano) and Ja√©n Cathedral (by Eufrasio L√≥pez de Rojas) suggest the artists' fluency in interpreting traditional motifs of Spanish cathedral architecture in the Baroque aesthetic idiom. In Madrid, a vernacular Baroque with its roots in Herrerian and in traditional brick construction was developed in the Plaza Mayor and in the Royal Palace of El Buen Retiro, which was destroyed during the French invasion by Napoleon's troops. Its gardens still remain as Parque del Buen Retiro. This sober brick Baroque of the 17th century is still well represented in the streets of the capital in palaces and squares. Estipite in the Basilica of Vera Cruz in Caravaca de la Cruz In contrast to the art of Northern Europe, the Spanish art of the period appealed to the emotions rather than seeking to please the intellect. The Churriguera family, which specialized in designing altars and retables, revolted against the sobriety of the Herreresque classicism and promoted an intricate, exaggerated, almost capricious style of surface decoration known as the Churrigueresque. Within half a century, they transformed Salamanca into an exemplary Churrigueresque city. The development of the style passed through three phases. Between 1680 and 1720, the Churriguera popularized Guarini's blend of Solomonic columns and Composite order, known as the \\"supreme order\\". Between 1720 and 1760, the Churrigueresque column, or estipite, in the shape of an inverted cone or obelisk, was established as a central element of ornamental decoration. The years from 1760 to 1780 saw a gradual shift of interest away from twisted movement and excessive ornamentation toward a neoclassical balance and sobriety. El Transparente of the Cathedral of Toledo Three of the most eye-catching creations of Spanish Baroque are the energetic facades of the University of Valladolid (Diego Tome and Fray Pedro de la Visitaci√≥n, 1719), the western fa√ßade (or Fachada del Obradoiro) of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela (Fernando de Casas y Novoa, 1750), and the Hospicio de San Fernando in Madrid (Pedro de Ribera, 1722), whose curvilinear extravagance seems to herald Antonio Gaud√≠ and Modernisme. In this case as in many others, the design involves a play of tectonic and decorative elements with little relation to structure and function. The focus of the florid ornamentation is an elaborately sculptured surround to a main doorway. If we remove the intricate maze of broken pediments, undulating cornices, stucco shells, inverted tapers and garlands from the rather plain wall it is set against, the building's form would not be affected in the slightest. However, Churrigueresque Baroque offered some of the most impressive combinations of space and light with buildings like Granada Charterhouse (sacristy by Francisco Hurtado Izquierdo), considered to be the apotheosis of Churrigueresque styles applied to interior spaces, or El Transparente of the Cathedral of Toledo by Narciso Tom√©, where sculpture and architecture are integrated to achieve notable light dramatic effects. The Royal Palace of Madrid and the interventions of Paseo del Prado (Sal√≥n del Prado and Alcal√° Doorgate) in the same city, deserve special mention. They were constructed in a sober Baroque international style, often mistaken for neoclassical, by the kings Philip V and Charles III. The Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso in Segovia and the Royal Palace of Aranjuez in Aranjuez are good examples of Baroque integration of architecture and gardening, with noticeable French influence (La Granja is known as the \\"Spanish Versailles\\"), but with local spatial conceptions which in some ways display the heritage of the Moorish occupation. In the richest imperial province of 17th-century Spain, Flanders, florid decorative detailing was more tightly knit to the structure, thus precluding concerns of superfluity. A remarkable convergence of Spanish, French and Dutch Baroque aesthetics may be seen in the Abbey of Averbode (1667). Another characteristic example is the Church of St. Michel at Louvain (1650‚Äì70), with its exuberant two-storey facade, clusters of half-columns, and the complex aggregation of French-inspired sculptural detailing. Six decades later, the architect Jaime Bort y Meli√° was the first to introduce Rococo to Spain (Cathedral of Murcia, west facade, 1733). The greatest practitioner of the Spanish Rococo style was a native master, Ventura Rodr√≠guez, responsible for the dazzling interior of the Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar in Zaragoza (1750).

Main facade by Jaime Bort Spanish/Hispanic America Monastery of San Francisco de As√≠s, Lima, 1673. The combination of the Native American and Moorish decorative influences with an extremely expressive interpretation of the Churrigueresque idiom may account for the full-bodied and varied character of the Baroque in the American colonies of Spain. Even more than its Spanish counterpart, American Baroque developed as a style of stucco decoration. Twin- towered facades of many American cathedrals of the seventeenth century had medieval roots and the full-fledged Baroque did not appear until 1664, when the Jesuit shrine on Plaza des Armas in Cusco was built. Even then, the new style hardly affected the structure of churches. The Peruvian Baroque was particularly lush, as evidenced by the monastery of San Francisco in Lima (1673), which has a dark intricate facade sandwiched between the yellow twin towers. Followed the model of Il Ges√π (also the case of the Jesuit Church of St. Paul in Lima, provincial \\"mestizo\\" (crossbred) styles emerged in Arequipa, Potos√≠ and La Paz. In the eighteenth century, the architects of the region turned for inspiration to the Mud√©jar art of medieval Spain. The late Baroque type of Peruvian facade first appears in the Church of Our Lady of Mercy, Lima (1697‚Äì1704). Similarly, the Iglesia de La Compa√±ia, Quito (1722‚Äì65) suggests a carved altarpiece with its richly sculpted facade and a surfeit of Solomonic column. church of Ss. Sebastian y Santa Prisca in Taxco (1751‚Äì58) bristles with Mexican Churrigueresque ornamentation. To the north, the richest province of 18th-century New Spain ‚Äì Mexico ‚Äì produced some fantastically extravagant and visually frenetic architecture known as Mexican Churrigueresque. This ultra-Baroque approach culminates in the works of Lorenzo Rodriguez, whose masterpiece is the Sagrario Metropolitano in Mexico City (1749‚Äì69). Other fine examples of the style may be found in the remote silver-mining towns. For instance, the Sanctuary at Ocotl√°n (begun in 1745) is a top-notch Baroque cathedral surfaced in bright red tiles, which contrast delightfully with a plethora of compressed ornament lavishly applied to the main entrance and the slender flanking towers (exterior, interior). The true capital of Mexican Baroque is Puebla, where a ready supply of hand-painted figurines (talavera) and vernacular gray stone led to its evolving further into a personalised and highly localised art form with a pronounced Indian flavour. There are about sixty churches whose facades and domes display glazed tiles of many colours, often arranged in Arabic designs. Their interiors are densely saturated with elaborate gold leaf ornamentation. In the 18th century, local artisans developed a distinctive brand of white stucco decoration, named \\"alfe√±ique\\" after a Pueblan candy made from egg whites and sugar. Earthquake Baroque is a style of Baroque architecture found in the Philippines, which suffered destructive earthquakes during the 17th century and 18th century, where large public buildings, such as churches, were rebuilt in a Baroque style.\\"Antigua‚Äôs Environs ‚Äì Antigua, Guatemala\\".

Plot Following a cataclysm, the earth becomes an immense desert in which the scarcity of drinkable water renders it a valuable commodity. The story centers around Juju, a teenage boy who belongs to one of the gangs which prevail on behalf of the new organizations, and Rael, a girl who will perhaps be able to save humanity.  Characters  = Main characters = ;Juju Meyer A fourteen-year-old boy who is in a gang in the city near the West Sea. He and his sister, Anna-Marie, are orphans. His father was abusive to his mother (to the point she could no longer walk) and him. As a result, his sister shot and killed him. Juju wishes to bottle up his memories of his family. He does not talk about his sister because she does not remember him. He and sister was taken in by Stipe (leader of a gang). He was taught by Cori under Stipe's command. After he meets Rael on the \\"Higher Ground\\", the sacred island, he helps her escape.

She possess super strength and speed and can let a voice out that can be mistaken for a howl which scares dogs away. She also talented with a gun. She has multiple personalities. :Blonie Blonie is a shy and nervous personality. :Hooper Hooper, in contrast to Blonie, is horribly sarcastic and an egomaniac. :Quint Quint is different she needs observation. =East Valley= ;Yunfa A country girl from the Eastern (Caren) Valley who has never been to the capital. Everyone calls her Yun. She wears a beanie with a x smile, smiley face and a tag. She saves Juju after he fights Riam when he's trying to get water for Rael. When Juju won against Riam she states she was right to believe in him and she treated his wounds. She starts to like Juju and is often worried about him. She becomes intimidated when she is near Real thought she does not no way. She blushes when Real stated she always be with Juju.

PK is the precursor of plasma kallikrein, which is a serine protease that activates kinins. PK is cleaved to produce kallikrein by activated Factor XII (Hageman factor). Structure Prekallikrein is homologous to factor XI, and similarly consists of four apple domains and a fifth, catalytic serine protease domain. The four apple domains create a disk-like platform around the base of the catalytic domain. However, unlike factor XI, prekallikrein does not form dimers. Prekallikrein is activated to form kallikrein by factor XII cleavage of a bond homologous to the corresponding bond cleaved during factor XI activation.  Prekallikrein deficiency  Hereditary deficiencies in PK are very rare. They can cause a prolonged APTT, which can be corrected by incubation of the patient‚Äôs plasma. Deficiencies in PK can also be acquired due to some disease states, such as angioedema, infection, DIC, and sickle- cell disease. Although most cases of prekallikrein deficiency are asymptomatic, a few reports link severe prekallikrein deficiency with thrombotic phenomena and recurrent pregnancy loss. More recently, a case of prekallikrein deficiency was shown to be associated with severe mucosal bleeding.  Discovery of prekallikrein  PK was initially described by Hathaway et al. in 1965 after encountering a Kentucky family who exhibited strikingly abnormal APTT results, but showed no bleeding symptoms. The family appeared to have a hereditary deficiency in an unknown coagulation factor, dubbed ‚ÄúFletcher factor‚Äù after the family.

FAOSTAT data are provided as a time-series from 1961 in most domains for 245 countries in English, Spanish and French. About FAOSTAT FAOSTAT is maintained by the Statistics Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In working directly with the countries, the Statistics Division supports the development of national statistical strategies, the strengthening of Institution and technical capacities, and the improvement of statistical systems. The FAOSTAT system is one of FAO‚Äôs most important corporate systems. It is a major component of FAO‚Äôs information systems, contributing to the organization‚Äôs strategic objective of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture for development and the fight against global hunger and malnutrition. It is at the core of the World Agricultural Information Centre (WAICENT). WAICENT gives access to FAO‚Äôs vast store of information on agricultural and food topics ‚Äì statistical data, documents, books, images, and maps. FAOSTAT Domains *Production The Agricultural Production domain covers: Produced quantities, producer prices, value at farmgate, harvested area, yield per hectare. *Trade The Agriculture Trade domain provides comprehensive, comparable, and up-to-date annual trade statistics by country, region and economic country groups for about 600 individual food and agriculture commodities since 1961. The detailed food and agriculture trade data collected, processed and disseminated by FAO according to the standard International Merchandise Trade Statistics Methodology (IMTS) are directly submitted by the national authorities to FAO or received via international or regional partner organizations. Data for missing reporters are estimated manly through the use of the data reported by the trading partners. The total merchandise trade value by country is annually updated according to the national publications on Balance of Payment and trade statistics and harmonised with the consolidated figures disseminated by the WTO-Common Data Set (CDS) on Total Merchandise Trade Statistics by countries. *Food Security Food supply data is some of the most important data in FAOSTAT. In fact, this data is for the basis for estimation of global and national undernourishment assessment, when it is combined with parameters and other data sets. This data has been the foundation of Food Balance Sheets ever since they were first constructed. The data is accessed by both business and governments for economic analysis and policy setting, as well as being used by the academic community. *Agri-Environmental Indicators Agri-environmental indicators (AEI) are indicators able to describe and assess state and trends in the environmental performance of agriculture to furnish useful indications to scientists and policymakers about the state of the environment, about the effects of different policies, as well as about the efficiency in the use of budgets in terms of environmental outcomes. *Food Balance Sheet A food balance sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period. Food balance sheets are prepared for both individual countries and regional/economic country aggregates. The domain covers production, trade, feed and seed, waste, other utilisation, and food availability. *Prices The prices domain of FAOSTAT contains: annual and monthly producer prices, annual producer price index, and consumer price index. *Resources Some of the most interesting data for economists is found in this domain. The national distribution of land, among arable land, pasture and other lands, as well as the importance of irrigation are just some of the interesting data sets. *Emissions FAOSTAT data on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by countries are provided within the FAOSTAT Emissions database [1,2,3], covering nearly 200 countries. GHG emissions are estimated in agreement with the default methodologies of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories [2]. The FAOSTAT Emissions data directly contributed to the IPCC 5th Assessment Report [3]. The GHG data are updated automatically at annual intervals. They are accessible in FAOSTAT via two separate domains: Emissions-Agriculture and Emissions-Land Use. *Emissions-Agriculture This FAOSTAT data domain contains estimates of GHG emissions for nearly 200 countries, for the reference period 1961‚Äìpresent [1,2,3], following default (Tier 1) IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories [4]. Emissions from agriculture comprise methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases released through microbial fixation and decomposition processes in crop fields and livestock systems, in the following sub-categories: ** Enteric Fermentation ** Manure Management ** Rice Cultivation ** Synthetic Fertilizers ** Manure applied to Soils ** Manure left on Pasture ** Crop Residues ** Cultivation of Organic Soils ** Burning - Crop Residues ** Burning ‚Äì Savanna ** Energy Use in Agriculture The FAOSTAT data contributed to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report [5]. *Emissions-Land Use This FAOSTAT data domain contains estimates of GHG emissions for nearly 200 countries, for the reference period 1990-2010 [1, 2, 3], following default (Tier 1) IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories [4]. The GHG data include emissions by sources and removals by sinks from Forestry and Other Land Use activities (FOLU), also referred to as Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). Except for Biomass Burning, containing only non-CO2 emissions from anthropogenic fires, FOLU emissions and removals are dominated by CO2 lost or stored as a result of human intervention on the following four IPCC land use categories: ** Forest Land (net forest conversion, forest) ** Cropland (cropland organic soils) ** Grassland (grassland organic soils) ** Biomass Burning (biomass and peat fires) Emissions and removals are calculated both within land categories (e.g. due to management) and for conversion between land categories (e.g. due to human-driven land use change). Data contribute to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report [5]. *Investment In the FAOSTAT investment domain, data can be found on stock, external assistance to agriculture, machine (mechanical), and government spending. *Forestry FAOSTAT‚ÄìForestry provides annual production and trade estimates for numerous forest products, primarily wood products such as roundwood, sawnwood, wood panels, pulp and paper. For many forest products, historical data are available from 1961. The forestry domain covers: forestry production and forestry trade flows Data contained in FAOSTAT are also published in the FAO Statistical Yearbook in hard copy and online.

Founding and history Oakland School for the Arts is a college preparatory, arts middle and high school. It was founded in 2000 as a charter school in the Oakland Unified School District through the efforts of then Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown. It received 501(c)(3) nonprofit status in October 2001. In September 2002, OSA opened its doors with a ninth-grade class and added another high school grade each subsequent year. Loni Berry was the director of the school for the first four years. For the 2005‚Äì06 school year, a middle school was added. Initially, the middle school and high school were kept separate with different entrances and shorter school hours for the middle school. Some performances combined both middle and high school students. In later years, there has been more integration among grade levels in academic areas. OSA began with seven art emphases: Theater, Dance, Literary Arts, Instrumental Music, Production Design, Visual Art, and Vocal Music. During the 2005‚Äì06 school year, Production Design was merged into Visual Arts. Faced with budget cuts in 2006, the school merged Theater, Arts Management, Literary Arts, and Visual Art and Design into one Theatre emphasis. In 2007, Literary Arts and Visual Art returned to separate emphases. From 2010 to 2014 the school also offered a Circus emphasis becoming the first high school in the United States to offer circus arts as a major. The school was first located at the Alice Arts Center building in downtown Oakland. It was moved to temporary buildings near the Fox Oakland Theatre during the 2004‚Äì05 school year and moved into the Fox Oakland Theater building in Uptown Oakland in January 2009.

The hotel was founded in 1926 as a European-style hotel for the carriage trade by Swiss-born Max Haering. History Hotel Elys√©e was founded in 1926 as a European-style hotel for the carriage trade by Swiss-born Max Haering. New York's leading hatcheck concessionaire, Mayer Quain, purchased the hotel out of bankruptcy in 1937. After the War, his children eclectically designed every room so that no two rooms were alike. In lieu of traditional numbers, the rooms were named to reflect their personality, such as the \\"Sayonara\\" suite assigned to Marlon Brando after his starring role in Teahouse of the August Moon. Tennessee Williams lived in the hotel for fifteen years and died in the \\"Sunset\\" suite. Columnist Jimmy Breslin, who regards the Elys√©e as \\"a great hotel, a genuine New York landmark,\\" succeeded Ruark as the hotel's unofficial chronicler. Upon Tennessee Williams's death at the Elys√©e in February 1983, Breslin recalled the story of a transient guest who called the front desk at 5:00 am complaining that someone in the next suite was keeping her awake by typing all night. \\"They knew right away who the culprit was, but they couldn't very well ask Mr. Williams to stop playwriting, so we simply moved the guest to another room.\\" In November 1948, Tallulah Bankhead celebrated President Harry S. Truman's stunning victory over Thomas E. Dewey by throwing a noisy party at the hotel that ran non-stop for five days and nights. The Monkey Bar The Elys√©e is known for the Monkey Bar, a piano bar just off the lobby. Opened in the 1940s, it became known to the cognoscenti as \\"the place to go where jokes die,\\" especially off-color jokes and double-entendre songs spun by such performers as Johnny Payne (1934-1964), Marion Page (1950-1965) and Mel Martin (1945-1983). Johnny Andrews played the piano at cocktail hour for over 50 years (1936-1990). Starting out as just another dimly lit hotel piano bar with mirrored paneling, the tiny room was expanded in the early 1950s when the mirrors were replaced by wraparound hand-painted mural by caricaturist Charlie Vella . Eight more monkeys were added to the bar mural in 1984 by artist Diana Voyentzie \\"to remind customers of their behaviour.\\" In 1995, when the bar was redesigned by the architect David Rockwell, all of the monkeys were unified by Voyentzie with more monkeys and palm trees and foliage. The monkeys in the mural depict monkeys having a good time. These monkeys by Voyentzie remained true to the original artist Charlie Vella. She also rewrote his name on the monkeys that were taken out of the frames and placed on the walls. This is well documented in Murals of New York City, by Glenn Palmer-Smith. Edward Sorrel painted in the Restaurant..not the actual Monkey BAR.

Development of the theory  The theory of efficient breach seeks to explain the common law's preference for expectation damages for breach of contract, as distinguished from specific performance, reliance damages, or punitive damages. According to Black's Law Dictionary, efficient breach theory is \\"the view that a party should be allowed to breach a contract and pay damages, if doing so would be more economically efficient than performing under the contract.\\" Expectation damages, according to the theory, give parties an incentive to breach when and only when performance is inefficient. The first statement of the theory of efficient breach appears to have been made in 1970 in a law review article by Robert L. Birmingham in \\"Breach of Contract, Damage Measures, and Economic Efficiency\\".24 Rutgers L.Rev. 273, 284 (1970) (\\"Repudiation of obligations should be encouraged where the promisor is able to profit from his default after placing his promisee in as good a position as he would have occupied had performance been rendered.\\"). The theory was named seven years later by Charles Goetz and Robert Scott.\\"Liquidated Damages, Penalties, and the Just Compensation Principle: A Theory of Efficient Breach\\", 77 Colum.L.Rev. 554 (1977). Efficient breach theory is commonly associated with Richard Posner and the Law and Economics school of thought. Posner explains his views in his majority opinion in Lake River Corp. v. Carborundum Co., 769 F.2d 1284 (7th Cir. 1985). Simple versions of the efficient breach theory employed arguments from welfare economics, operating on the premise that legal rules should be designed to give parties an incentive to act in ways that maximize aggregate welfare or achieve Pareto efficiency. More sophisticated versions of the theory maintain that parties themselves prefer remedies that incentivize efficient breach, as efficient breach maximizes the gains of trade from transacting. As Richard Posner and Andrew Rosenfeld put the point, \\"the more efficiently the exchange is structured, the larger is the potential profit of the contract for the parties to divide between them.\\"Richard A. Posner & Andrew M. Rosenfeld, Impossibility and Related Doctrines in Contract Law: An Economic Analysis, 6 J. Legal Stud. 83, 89 (1977).  Posner's illustration  Judge Richard Posner gave this well-known illustration of efficient breach in \\"Economic Analysis of Law\\": > Suppose I sign a contract to deliver 100,000 custom-ground widgets at $.10 > apiece to A, for use in his boiler factory. After I have delivered 10,000, B > comes to me, explains that he desperately needs 25,000 custom-ground widgets > at once since otherwise he will be forced to close his pianola factory at > great cost, and offers me $.15 apiece for 25,000 widgets. I sell him the > widgets and as a result do not complete timely delivery to A, who sustains > $1000 in damages from my breach. Having obtained an additional profit of > $1250 on the sale to B, I am better off even after reimbursing A for his > loss. Society is also better off. Since B was willing to pay me $.15 per > widget, it must mean that each widget was worth at least $.15 to him. But it > was worth only $.14 to A$.10, what he paid, plus $.04 ($1000 divided by > 25,000), his expected profit. Thus, the breach resulted in a transfer of the > 25,000 widgets from a lower valued to a higher valued use.  Criticism  Some, such as Charles Fried in his \\"Contract as Promise\\", have argued that morally, A is obligated to honor a contract made with B because A has made a promise. Fried wrote, \\"The moralist of duty thus posits a general obligation to keep promises, of which the obligation of contract will only be a special case ‚Äì that special case in which certain promises have attained legal as well as moral force.\\" It would seem that Fried has since revised his interpretation. Others argue that the costs of litigation relevant to gaining expectation damages from breach would leave one or both of the original parties worse off than if the contract had simply been performed. Also, Posner's hypothetical assumes that the seller is aware of the value the buyer places on the commodity, or the cost of purchase plus the profits the buyer will make.Eisenberg, Melvin, Basic Contract Law, 8th ed.

The shorter headstream of ≈Ωupanjevaƒçka reka (Cyrillic: –ñ—É–ø–∞—ö–µ–≤–∞—á–∫–∞ —Ä–µ–∫–∞) originates from the mountain of Glediƒáke planine in southern ≈†umadija region of central Serbia. Its spring is just some 500 m away from the source of Lugomir's another headstream, the Dulenska reka. The river first flows to the east, next to the villages of Nadrlje, ≈Ωupanjevac, Dragovo and Belu≈°iƒá. At this point, the ≈Ωupanjevaƒçka reka reaches the Juhor mountain, turns north along the Juhor's western slopes, and after the village of Beoƒçiƒá meets the Dulenska reka. The longer headstream of Dulenska reka (37,5 km; Cyrillic: –î—É–ª–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞ —Ä–µ–∫–∞) also originates from the mountain of Glediƒáke planine at an altitude of 793 m (Gomila peak), but flows northward. At the village of Dulene the river is dammed by the temporary (but still functioning) 7-meter high filled dam in 1964. The artificial lake Dulene (Dulensko jezero; Cyrillic: –î—É–ª–µ–Ω—Å–∫–æ —ò–µ–∑–µ—Ä–æ) is created, with an altitude of 435 m, a tunnel was dug through the Glediƒáke planine and pipeline with pumps set to take water out into another artificial lake of Gro≈°nica which is used for the supplying of the city of Kragujevac with water. The river turns east, receives the Pƒçeliƒçka reka from the left at the village of Velike Pƒçelice and flows through the small town and municipal seat of Rekovac where it turns south. At the villages of Teƒçiƒá, Vukmanovac and Loƒáika, the Dulenska reka forms a small arc and turns northward in the narrow valley on the western slopes of the Juhor mountain, where it meets the ≈Ωupanjevaƒçka reka at the village of Drago≈°evac.  Lugomir  The Lugomir proper is 19,5 km long. The river continues the northeast direction of the Dulenska reka, along the western side of the Juhor, and enters the region of Veliko Pomoravlje. It flows through the villages of Kolare, Bresje and Majur and the southern outskirts of the town of Jagodina. After it is crossed by the Belgrade-Ni≈° highway, the Lugomir empties into the Velika Morava near the village of Ribari.

Independent paper folding traditions exist in East Asia, and it is unclear whether they evolved separately or had a common source. Origins and the traditional designs The Japanese word \\"origami\\" itself is a compound of two smaller Japanese words: \\"ori\\" (root verb \\"oru\\"), meaning to fold, and \\"kami\\", meaning paper. Until recently, not all forms of paper folding were grouped under the word origami. Before that, paper folding for play was known by a variety of names, including \\"orikata\\", \\"orisue\\", \\"orimono\\", \\"tatamigami\\" and others. Exactly why \\"origami\\" became the common name is not known; it has been suggested that the word was adopted in kindergartens because the written characters were easier for young children to write. Another theory is that the word \\"origami\\" was a direct translation of the German word \\"Papierfalten\\", brought into Japan with the Kindergarten Movement around 1880. Japanese origami began sometime after Buddhist monks carried paper to Japan during the 6th century.Nick Robinson, The Origami Bible (2004), p. 10. The first Japanese origami dates from this period and was used for religious ceremonial purposes only, due to the high price of paper.Lang, Robert James. (1988). The Complete Book of Origami: Step-by Step Instructions in Over 1000 Diagrams/48 Original Models. Courier Dover Publications. A reference in a poem by Ihara Saikaku from 1680 describes the origami butterflies used during Shinto weddings to represent the bride and groom. Samurai warriors are known to have exchanged gifts adorned with noshi, a sort of good luck token made of folded strips of paper, which indicates that origami had become a significant aspect of Japanese ceremony by the Heian period (794‚Äì1185). In 1797 the first known origami book was published in Japan: Senbazuru orikata. There are several origami stories in Japanese culture, such as a story of no Seimei making a paper bird and turning it into a real one. The earliest evidence of paperfolding in Europe is a picture of a small paper boat in the 1498 French edition of Johannes de Sacrobosco's Tractatus de Sphaera Mundi. There is also evidence of a cut and folded paper box from 1440. It is possible that paperfolding in the west originated with the Moors much earlier; however, it is not known if it was independently discovered or knowledge of origami came along the silk route. The modern growth of interest in origami dates to the design in 1954 by Akira Yoshizawa of a notation to indicate how to fold origami models. The Yoshizawa-Randlett system is now used internationally. Today the popularity of origami has given rise to origami societies such as the British Origami Society and OrigamiUSA. The first known origami social group was founded in Zaragoza, Spain during the 1940s.Gimenez, Luis Fernando. \\"Origami: el arte del papel plegado\\". Centro de historia de zaragoza, 2009 The Chinese word for paper folding is \\"Zhe Zhi\\" (Êë∫Á¥ô), and some Chinese contend that origami is a historical derivative of Chinese paperfolding. Modern designs and innovations An example of modular origami (geometric shapes formed from Sonobe units) Friedrich Fr√∂bel, inventor of the kindergartens, recognized paper binding, weaving, folding, and cutting as teaching aids for child development during the early 19th century. As the kindergarten system spread throughout Europe and into the rest of the world, it brought with it the small colored squares that we know of today as origami paper. Josef Albers, the father of modern color theory and minimalistic art, taught origami and paper folding in the 1920s and 30s at the famous Bauhaus design school. His methods, which involved sheets of round paper that were folded into spirals and curved shapes, have influenced modern origami artists like Kunihiko Kasahara. The work of Akira Yoshizawa, of Japan, a creator of origami designs and a writer of books on origami, inspired a modern renaissance of the craft. He invented the process and techniques of wet- folding and set down the initial set of symbols for the standard Yoshizawa- Randlett system that Robert Harbin and Samuel Randlett later improved upon. His work was promoted through the studies of Gershon Legman as published in the seminal books of Robert Harbin's Paper Magic and more so in Secrets of the Origami Masters which revealed the wide world of paper folding in the mid-1960s. Modern origami has attracted a worldwide following, with ever more intricate designs and new techniques. One of these techniques is 'wet- folding,' the practice of dampening the paper somewhat during folding to allow the finished product to hold shape better. Variations such as modular origami, also known as unit origami, is a process where many origami units are assembled to form an often decorative whole. Complex origami models normally require thin, strong paper or tissue foil for successful folding; these lightweight materials allow for more layers before the model becomes impractically thick. Modern origami has broken free from the traditional linear construction techniques of the past, and models are now frequently wet- folded or constructed from materials other than paper and foil. With popularity, a new generation of origami creators has experimented with crinkling techniques and smooth-flowing designs used in creating realistic masks, animals, and other traditional artistic themes. Sadako and the thousand cranes One of the most famous origami designs is the Japanese crane. The crane is auspicious in Japanese culture. Legend says that anyone who folds one thousand paper cranes will have their heart's desire come true. The origami crane (ÊäòÈ∂¥ orizuru in Japanese) has become a symbol of peace because of this belief and because of a young Japanese girl named Sadako Sasaki. Sadako was exposed to the radiation of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima as an infant, and it took its inevitable toll on her health. She was then a hibakusha ‚Äì an atom bomb survivor. By the time she was twelve in 1955, she was dying of leukemia. Her classmate told her about the legend, so she decided to fold one thousand origami cranes so that she could live. However, when she saw that the other children in her ward were dying, she realized that she would not survive and wished instead for world peace and an end to suffering. A popular fictional version of the tale is that Sadako folded 644 cranes before she died; her classmates then continued folding cranes in honor of their friend. This version of her story has been refuted by the Hiroshima Peace Museumhttp://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/virtual/VirtualMuseum_e/exhibit_e/exh0107_e/exh01071_e.html and her family.https://sadakosasaki.com She was buried with many cranes, folded both by Sadako herself and her classmates. While her effort could not extend her life, it moved her friends to make a statue of Sadako in the Hiroshima Peace Park. Every year 10,000,000 cranes are sent to Hiroshima and placed near the statue.http://www.city.hiroshima.lg.jp/www/contents/1319176286322/index.html A group of one thousand paper cranes is called senbazuru in Japanese (ÂçÉÁæΩÈ∂¥). The tale of Sadako has been dramatized in many books and movies. Sadako's older brother, Masahiro Sasaki co-wrote Sadako's complete story in English, as he remembers it, in hope of dispelling the many fictionalized versions of his sister's story.https://sadakosasaki.com See also * History of paper * Mathematics of paper folding  Notes and references  Further reading * ‚Äì A collection of 115 essays by a historian of origami.

The building is said to be the first U.S. factory at which precision interchangeable parts were made, giving birth to the precision machine tool industry. In recognition of this history, the building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1966. and In 1987, the building was recognized by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers as an International Heritage Site, and the collection was recognized as an International Heritage Collection. For each of these designations, the armory was considered a site where pivotal events occurred in the history of American industry, as well as a place that lends itself to comprehensive interpretation of that history. A \\"machine tool\\" is a machine which makes parts to other machines, such as screws or gun stocks, generally without a skilled craftsman doing the precision work. Instead, a machine operator controls the machine as it does the precision work. Lathes, milling machines, and drill presses are precision machine tools. The museum has the largest collection of historically significant machine tools in the United States. The museum's holdings include a collection of industrial machinery spanning the first one hundred years of precision manufacturing, along with fine examples of early machined products including rifles, sewing machines, and typewriters. Photographs and archival records provide additional resources for interpreting this critical phase of the Industrial Revolution. The museum is open daily from 10am until 5pm from May 1 through October. History of the building = Robbins and Lawrence Armory = Richard S. Lawrence, a brilliant mechanic, moved to Windsor in 1838 at age 21 and started making guns in the Windsor Prison. He joined Nicanor Kendall, who had a gun-making shop, and together started a new company. Four years later businessman Samuel E. Robbins came to Windsor. In 1846, Samuel Robbins, Nicanor Kendall, and Richard Lawrence took the bold step of bidding on a government contract for 10,000 rifles. Having won the contract, they then constructed a four-story brick building beside Mill Brook. Over the next eight years, the factory was built and machines to make precision parts were made. They brought in workers and mechanics, invented new machines, adapted old ones, and perfected techniques for producing interchangeable parts. Later, Lawrence bought out Kendall. Within a few years, they were exporting not only rifles but also their new metal cutting machines across North America, to England and around the world. The technology for making guns was quickly adapted to making consumer products as well as parts for many other machines The imposing, four-story structure rises from a stone foundation adjacent to a brook that provided immediate and efficient use of waterpower. Inside, power was distributed throughout each floor with line shafting; the shafts were connected to individual machines by leather belts. Abundant windows and the building's narrow width relative to its length (40‚Äô x 100‚Äô), brought daylight into the interior work areas. Outside, the immediate neighborhood is still home to worker housing that was built at various times in the factory's history. The nearby Connecticut River and the active railroad attest to the importance of transportation in the development of the site.

Ten years later the property was sold to the Windsor Electric Light Company, before being sold to the Central Vermont Public Service Company in 1926. = The Museum: 1966 - Present = In 1964, CVPS proposed razing the building, prompting Smithsonian curator and Windsor resident, Edwin A. Battison to formulate plans for the creation of a museum. Battison had a relationship with CVPS, storing various items in the building since the 1950s. Windsor native Battison founded the American Precision Museum in 1966 and served as its director until 1991. Battison, a curator of Mechanical Engineering at the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution, secured the Robbins & Lawrence Armory to house the museum and the collection of historic machine tools, related books, and archival materials he had collected during his lifetime. The armory building is significant for its architectural integrity, which reflects the size, scale, and operation of a 19th-century factory. A National Historic Landmark, in 2001 it was designated a special project of Save America‚Äôs Treasures; in 2003, APM received a Save America‚Äôs Treasures award of $200,000 for installing a new slate roof to replace the deteriorated original.  Legacy of Robbins and Lawrence  = Early Manufacturing and the ‚ÄúAmerican System‚Äù = The first phase of the Industrial Revolution was introduced in America during the late 18th century and was modeled on the English system of textile manufacturing. In 1846, when the Armory was built, the second phase of the Industrial Revolution‚Äîthe ‚ÄúAmerican System‚Äù‚Äîwas about to be launched. In the remote village of Windsor, entrepreneurs and artisans had already constructed a series of dams that powered sawmills and a gristmill on the Mill Brook, 18 buildings and shops in total. In these small workshops, inventors developed designs for new products as well as making both new and old items more quickly. In Windsor and other towns up and down the Connecticut River Valley (known as the Precision Valley), new industries attracted more people and stimulated the creation of commercial downtowns. Mills, stores, and homes were clustered between the river and the steep hillsides. = Robbins & Lawrence Impact = There are two reasons that Robbins & Lawrence can be considered as founders of the precision tool industry. In 1851, Robbins and Lawrence traveled to London to demonstrate their rifles at the Great Exhibition, held in London's Crystal Palace. The rifles were made in Windsor using interchangeable parts. They won a medal and so impressed the British Army that they placed an order for 25,000 rifles for the Crimean War and also ordered 141 of the Robbins & Lawrence metal-working machines making the firm the first large-scale exporter of machine tools. began the ‚ÄúAmerican System‚Äù for producing interchangeable parts which accelerated the development of the precision tool-making industry that followed rapidly. The second reason Robbins & Lawrence can be credited with the birth of the precision tool industry is the number of people who were employed at the factory that went on to work at, or found, other companies. J.W. Roe produced a \\"Genealogy of the Robbins & Lawrence Shop\\" which is reproduced here, with permission, from Lindsay Publications. With the development of interchangeable parts, machines of all sorts could be made in large numbers and sold more cheaply. The manufacture of sewing machines, typewriters, bicycles, engines and cars soon followed. Precision machine tools which makes standardized parts make the mechanical equipment of our modern world. = Windsor, Vermont and Precision Manufacturing = Windsor, Vermont played an important role in the development of precision manufacturing and the machine tool industry in America. The Robbins & Lawrence armory served as a breeding ground for innovation in the mid-19th century and as a center for excellence in the high tech industry of its day. Military leaders and industrialists traveled to Windsor to learn about the new ‚ÄúAmerican System‚Äù of manufacturing, and workers from Windsor were aggressively recruited by other emerging industries. By continually increasing productivity, the machine tool industry spread the notion that material abundance was possible for a broad cross section of the American people. At its full maturity in the mid 20th century, the machine tool industry provided the backbone of American industrial strength and helped the United States develop into a world power.Genealogy of Robbins & Lawrence Past exhibits * 1995: Maxfield Parrish: Machinist, Artisan, Artist. Mr. Battison's friendship with the artist's son Maxfield Parrish, Jr.. had helped bring to the museum a number of interesting artifacts and photographs which represented the life and interests of the artist After the death of the younger Mr. Parrish in 1983. his widow, Helen Parrish, continued the family's generosity and donated to the museum additional Parrish materials.

Featuring letters, diaries, photographs, maps, paintings, and newspapers, the exhibition explores the day-to-day life of Vermont soldiers in camp and on the battlefield. These artifacts and images explore how the actions and decisions of ordinary people can have an enormous impact on historic events. ** Arming the Union: Gunmakers in Windsor, Vermont uncovers the influence of a little-known factory called Lamson, Goodnow & Yale. Operating out of the old Robbins & Lawrence armory in Windsor, the machine tool firm played a critical role in outfitting the Union Army. Altogether, the North produced more than 1.5 million rifles in the span of about three years, along with tens of thousands of pistols and carbines. The majority of those weapons were made using machinery designed and produced in Windsor. Arming the Union tells the story of the men and machines that made possible the production of guns on such a massive scale‚Äîthe story of the technological achievement that saved the Union. The two stories also overlap‚Äîand not simply because Vermont soldiers, like most in the Union Army, carried weapons produced on Vermont-made machinery. Half a dozen young men actually worked in the Windsor armory before shouldering rifles and heading off to war. Both exhibits are set inside the actual nineteenth-century factory building where the gunmaking machinery was perfected and built and where 50,000 Special Model 1861 rifle muskets were also produced by Lamson, Goodnow & Yale. Together these two exhibitions present a rarely seen view of Vermont's role in the Civil War. * 2017: Tribute to Brown and Sharpe  Current Exhibits  = 2008 - Present: Working Machine Shop (known as the Innovation Station) = = 2015 - Present: Tool Revolution = = 2016 - Present: Shaping America: Machines and Machinists at Work = This 4,000 square-foot exhibition focuses on the people whose work made great societal changes possible and the rise of the ‚ÄúAmerican System‚Äù of manufacturing. ‚ÄúShaping America‚Äù is the first comprehensive exhibition to examine Vermont's industrial history in-depth and explores the broad themes of innovation and problem solving, craftsmanship, and the influence of precision manufacturing upon American history and culture.

The hypothesis of the operation appears to be that reduction (resection) of marginally viable ventricular mass may result in superior geometric remodeling thus conferring better performance when faced with ventricular failure. In spite of promising initial results, the method was soon found to be of little if any benefit, and it is no longer considered a recommended treatment for the disease. The Batista procedure was invented by Brazilian physician and cardiac surgeon Randas Batista in 1994 for use in patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Many of his patients were victims of Chagas disease. Chagas disease represents a parasitic nonischemic cardiomyopathy targeting parasympathetic inflow to the heart. Chagas cardiomyopathy thus represents a unique method of study of diastolic heart failure. It may be addressed by removal of a portion of viable tissue from the left ventricle to reduce its size (partial left ventriculectomy), with or without repair or replacement of the mitral valve. Although several studies showed benefits from this surgery, studies at the Cleveland Clinic concluded that this procedure was associated with a high early and late failure rate. At 3 years only 26 percent were event-free and survival rate was only 60 percent. Most hospitals in the US have abandoned this operation and it is no longer included in heart failure guidelines.

This migration wave, known as the Ostflucht, began in the late 19th century, with most of the Ruhrpolen arriving around the 1870s. The migrants found employment in the mining, steel and construction industries. In 1913 there were between 300,000 and 350,000 Poles and 150,000 Masurians.

Amangkurat I (Amangkurat Agung; 1619‚Äì1677) was the sultan of Mataram from 1646 to 1677. He was the son of Sultan Agung Hanyokrokusumo. He experienced many rebellions during his reign. He died in exile in 1677, and buried in Tegalwangi (near Tegal), hence his posthumous title, Sunan Tegalwangi or Sunan Tegalarum. He was also nicknamed as Sunan Getek, because he was wounded when suppressing the rebellion of Raden Mas Alit, his own brother.  Genealogy  Born as Raden Mas Sayidin, he was the son of the powerful Sultan Agung. His mother was styled Ratu Wetan, daughter of Tumenggung Upasanta, Regent of Batang (descendant of Ki Juru Martani). When becoming a crown prince, he was styled Pangeran Arya Prabu Adi Mataram. Like other Mataram monarchs, Amangkurat I had two queen consorts: Ratu Kulon, daughter of Pangeran Pekik of Surabaya, who gave birth to RM. Rahmat (later Amangkurat II); and Ratu Wetan, originating from Kajoran family, who gave birth to RM. Darajat alias Pangeran Puger (later Pakubuwono I). =Children= # RM.

Wiramenggala upon her marriage to Tumenggung Wiramenggala II of Cangkalsewu. They are the great-grandparents of Yasadipura I, Surakarta writer # Prince B.P.H.Natabrata Early reign In 1645, he was appointed as Mataram monarch succeeding his father, styled Susuhunan Ing Alaga. Following his coronation in 1646, he was styled Kanjeng Susuhunan Prabu Amangkurat Agung, abbreviated as Amangkurat. In Javanese, the word Amangku means \\"to administer\\", and Rat means \\"world\\", thus Amangkurat means \\"administering the world\\". He then became a king who had full power over entire Mataram Sultanate and its vassal states. At his coronation, all royal family members swore allegiance to him. Amangkurat I got his father's heritage in the form of vast Mataram territory. In this case, he applied centralization. Upon taking the throne, he tried to bring long-term stability to the Sultanate of Mataram's realm, which was considerable in area but marred by continual rebellions. He murdered local leaders that were insufficiently deferential to him, including the still-powerful noble from Surabaya, Pangeran Pekik, his father-in-law. Other victims were Tumenggung Wiraguna and Tumenggung Danupaya, who was ordered to invade Blambangan Kingdom which had been conquered by Kingdom of Bali in 1647, but they were murdered en route to the east. He also closed ports and destroyed ships in coastal cities to prevent them from getting too powerful from their wealth. To further his glory, the new king abandoned Karta, Sultan Agung's capital, and moved to a grander red-brick palace in Plered (formerly the palace was built of wood). The palace's movement was slanted by rebellion of Raden Mas Alit or Prince Danupoyo, his own brother who opposed to senior figure's purge. This rebellion was supported by ulemas, but ended with RM. Alit's death. Amangkurat I turned to face ulemas. They, including their families (approximately more than 5,000‚Äì6,000 people), were gathered in alun-alun (city square) to be massacred.Ivan Aulia Ahsan, Saat 6.000 Ulama dan Keluarga Dibantai Sultan Mataram Islam, Tirto.id, 14 October 2017, accessed 26 May 2018.  Foreign relation  Amangkurat I made a close relation with Dutch East India Company previously fought by his father. In 1646, he allowed Dutch East India Company to open trade posts in Mataram territory, while Mataram was allowed to trade in other Dutch-ruled islands. Both of them also liberated prisoners each other. The treaty was viewed by Amangkurat I as the submission sign of Dutch East India company to Mataram rule. But, he was shocked when Dutch East India Company conquered Sultanate of Palembang in 1659. Hostility between Mataram and Banten also worsened. In 1650, Cirebon was ordered to conquer Banten but failed. 2 years later, Amangkurat I forbade rice and wood exports to the country. In the meantime, diplomatic relation between Mataram and Gowa which had been established by Sultan Agung was eventually deteriorated. Amangkurat I refused Gowa's messengers and asked Sultan Hasanuddin himself to come to Java. The request was certainly rejected. Conflict with crown prince Amangkurat I was also at odds with the crown prince, RM. Rahmat. The conflict was begun by a news that the position of crown prince would be transferred to Prince Singasari (another Amangkurat I's son). In 1661, RM. Rahmat rebelled against his father, but failed. Amangkurat I suppressed the entire of his son's supporters. In contrast, Amangkurat I also failed in poisoning RM. Rahmat in 1663. The crown prince (future Amangkurat II) felt that his life was not safe in the court after he took his father's concubine, Rara Oyi, with the help of his maternal grandfather, Pangeran Pekik of Surabaya, making Amangkurat I suspicious of a conspiracy among Surabayan factions to grab power in the capital by using Pekiks‚Äô grandson's powerful position as the crown prince. Amangkurat I sentenced his own father-in-law, Pangeran Pekik, to death, who was accused to abduct Rara Oyi for RM. Rahmat. Amangkurat I forgave his son after forcing him to kill Rara Oyi with his own hand. Trunajaya rebellion By the mid-1670s dissatisfaction with the king was turning into open revolt, beginning from the recalcitrant Eastern Java and creeping inward. RM. Rahmat conspired with Panembahan Rama of Kajoran, South Klaten, who proposed a stratagem in which the crown prince financed Rama's son-in-law, Trunajaya, to begin a rebellion in the East Java. Raden Trunajaya, a prince from Madura, lead a revolt supported by itinerant fighters from faraway Makassar, led by Karaeng Galesong (supporter of Sultan Hasanuddin who had been defeated by Dutch East India Company in 1668), that captured the king's court at Mataram in mid-1677. It is believed that a subsequent conflict occurred between Trunajaya and RM. Rahmat, causing Trunajaya not to cede power to him as planned before and even plundered the palace. RM. Rahmat who couldn't control Trunajaya was eventually in his father's side. The king escaped to the north coast with his eldest son, the future king, leaving his younger son Pangeran Puger in Mataram. Apparently more interested in profit and revenge than in running a struggling empire, the rebel Trunajaya looted the court and withdrew to his stronghold in Kediri, East Java, leaving Puger in control of a weak court. Seizing this opportunity, Puger assumed the throne in the ruins of Plered with the title Susuhunan ing Alaga. Death Soon after this episode, Amangkurat I fell sick in exile. According to Babad Tanah Jawi, his death was catalyzed by poisoned coconut water given by RM. Rahmat. Despite of this, he still appointed RM. Rahmat as his successor, but accompanied by a curse that none of his descendants who would become a king but one, who would rule in a short period. Amangkurat I also made a will that RM. Rahmat also asked for help to Dutch East India Company in seize the throne from Trunajaya. Amangkurat I died in Wanayasa forest and buried near his teacher near Tegal. Because of its fragrant soil, the village where Amangkurat I was buried would be known as Tegalwangi or Tegalarum. 12 Dutch soldiers led by Oufers attended his funeral. He was succeeded by his eldest son as king in 1677, who reigned as Amangkurat II. He founded Sunanate of Kartasura as the successor of Mataram Sultanate.

Around one thousand girls, age 4 to 18, from Guildford and its surrounding towns and villages, attend the school. Guildford High School comprises a Junior School, Senior School and Sixth Form. History From the beginning, Guildford High School, founded by the Church Schools Company in 1888, was a progressive school. While some early girls' schools were designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of prospective governesses, Guildford High School sought to provide a feminine counterpart to the reformed public schools for boys. The current site on London Road was completed in 1893 and is still in use. During the post-World War II years, the school underwent rapid expansion. By the 1980s, student numbers had increased to over 600. Today the school has over 980 girls and is still part of the Company (now known as the United Church Schools Trust).  Campus  The school possesses a sports' centre off of the main campus. This includes an indoor swimming pool, gym, sports hall, fitness suite and social area. The main campus consists of the Senior school, the sixth form house (Morton House), Nightingale Road House, and the Junior school. Harper House was bought and added to the premises, also enlarging the gardens, in August 2011. The garden of the original Nightingale Road House were converted into a social area when the site was acquired in 2006.

The organization focuses on family court reform, research and public education with the goal to make shared parenting the general norm in every state. The stated mission of the organization is to improves the lives of children and strengthen society by protecting every child's right to the love and care of both parents after separation or divorce and to seek better lives for children through family court reform that establishes equal rights and responsibilities for fathers and mothers.  History  The organization was founded in Massachusetts in 1998 with the name Foundation for Fathers and Families. The founders were Ned Holstein, John Cristofano, Phil Clendenning and John Maguire. The name was later shortened to Fathers and Families. In 2013 the name was changed to the National Parents Organization in order to reflect the organizations belief in gender neutral shared parenting and parental equality, as opposed to seeking any special rights for fathers.  Family Court Reform  The National Parents Organization seeks to reform laws both at the state and the national level to encourage shared parenting. Most of the family court reform work is done by local affiliates on a state- by-state basis. In Kentucky, the National Parents Organization was instrumental in the 2018 passage of HB528, the nation's first presumption that shared parenting is in the best interest of the child. In Virginia, the local affiliate led the successful campaign for House Bill 1351, requiring courts to consider shared custody arrangements along with sole custody. In 2016, the NPO affiliate in Missouri helped pass a law stating that judges may not give custody preference to a parent because of gender, age or financial status. , In Utah, the National Parents Organization was a catalyst for House Bill 35, which encourages family courts to more equally award physical custody after a divorce or separation. The bill passed in 2015 . The organization has advocated for and helped pass military parent child custody legislation in several states, ad has introduced legislation protecting men and children against paternity fraud. Members have served on state child support guidelines revision committees..  Research  The organization promotes and disseminates scientific research on how children are effected by shared parenting versus other custody arrangements. It has published a Shared Parenting National Report Card, which gave each state a grade of A to F on the degree to which they promote shared parenting after divorce or separation. The highest grade, which was just a B, was received by Alaska, Arizona and Minnesota. The lowest grade of an F was received by New York and Rhode Island. In Ohio, the local chapter evaluated and compared the court guidelines that each county uses to determine parenting time when parents cannot agree. Each county received a grade of A to F, with A given to guidelines with the most equal time. Most counties received a D, but two counties, Ashtabula and Tuscarawas, received an A, while one county, Van Wert, received an F. The media attention generated interest and discussions among judges and court officials, with some counties revising their guidelines.  Public Education  Through conferences and media, the National Parents Organization does public education on the benefits of shared parenting, based on scientific research from across the globe. Members also works to raise awareness about the problems with parental alienation. Together with the International Council on Shared Parenting, the National Parents Organization sponsored the Third International Conference on Shared Parenting, held in Boston in May 2017. The theme of the conference was Shared Parenting Research: A Watershed in Understanding Children‚Äôs Best Interest? The conference had presentations by scientists in the field of optimal post-divorce parenting arrangements . The organization engages social, local, and national media to raise awareness about the family court system, shared parenting and parental alienation, with coverage by many both minor and major media outlets.. For example, in 2018 the co-chair of the Virginia chapter wrote an Op-Ed on comparing the growing uproar to children being separated from their parents at the border with the forced child-parent separations imposed by our family courts.  Organizational Structure  The organization is headquartered in Newton, Massachusetts; Ned Holstein Massachusetts, is Founder and Chairman of the Board The National Executive Director is Petra Maxwell. There are 16 state affiliates in California, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah and Virginia.

Inishmurray ( or ) is an uninhabited island situated off the coast of County Sligo, Ireland.  Geography  The island covers .  Etymology  Inishmurray may be named after the early saint, Muiredach mac Echdach (fl. early 6th century) of Killala.  History  There are remains of an early Irish monastic settlement. Laisr√©n (Saint Molaise) Mac Decl√°in reputedly founded a monastery here in the 6th century. He was confessor of Saint Columba (Colmcille) after the Battle of C√∫l Dreimhne on the mainland nearby. His feast day is 12 August. The island's ecclesiastical settlement was attacked in 795 and again in 807 by the Vikings, and eventually the monks abandoned the island and it remained uninhabited until the first secular settlement, probably in the 12th century. =Monastery= The enclosure wall is impressive - reaching in height at its highest point and up to thick. The site contains various ecclesiastical buildings including enclosures, a stone-roofed oratory, two churches, a cloch√°n, a large beehive-shaped cell, a holy well and other remains including cross slabs suggesting foreign influences. The whole complex is composed of what is probably local sandstone rubble. =Recent history= The local population peaked at just over 100 in the 1880s but the last residents moved out to the mainland on 12 November 1948. Some of the buildings are still visible including 15 houses and the island's school. The site remained a pilgrimage destination right up to recent times. In 2018, the Marine Survey Office of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport caused controversy when it banned commercial operators from landing visitors on the island, due \\"to concerns for safety during embarking and disembarking\\".

Property Harviala has been an immense property in Southern H√§me (Tavastia) in Finland. The manor and the seat of lordship were in Vanaja. Holders of the property were hereditary, and through at least ten generations, they were mighty regional magnates in Tavastia. Highly probably, the family was of ancient Finnish extraction and had formed some power base already in mists of history. Earlier holders of Harviala are not known to our days. Dynasty of Harviala 1) Royal Councillor John, son of Andrew, of the family of Karppia (in Swedish, J√∂ns), is mentioned as member of the Privy Council of Sweden from 1396 onwards. In Tavastia, he owned much property, for example the manor of Lepist√∂. One of his ancestors may have come from Germany. His family's other ancestors were from mists of history magnates in Finnish Tavastia. 2) Christina J√∂nsdotter of Karppi, wed to Nicholas (Klas) Lydekason, bailiff of the Turku castle, of German, possibly Muenster, extraction, and whose family became known as Djekn 3) Bridget Klasdotter, heiress of Suontaka in Tyrv√§nt√∂, wed to Henry Sword (Heikki Sw√§rth, Henrik Sv√§rd), member of the Privy Council of Sweden, of the house of Kurki of Laukko and Niemenp√§√§, Lord of Harviala and Niemenp√§√§ 4) Ragnhild Henriksdotter (Sv√§rd) m Hans Pedersson of Lepas 5) Nicholas (Niilo, Klaus Hansson), married with a woman whose name is unknown to our age, but who possibly belonged to the family of S√§rkilahti of Taivassalo, in the Turku archipelago 6) Bridget of Harviala, Pirjo Klauntyt√§r, wed to Lasse Matson, district judge of Hattula, was childless. Harviala passed to her brother: Bero of Lepas (died 1584), Bero Nicolai de Finlandia (Bj√∂rn Klasson av Lepas), member of Privy Council of Sweden since 1523.

Brita's mother Sofia was a bastard daughter of king John III of Sweden with Karin Hansdotter. 9) Baron Lawrence, Lars Jespersson Cruus af Edeby, Lord of Harviala, younger son of Jeppe and Brita. Sir Lawrence was created Baron of Gudhem (Cruus af Gudhem). He held property which belonged together to him and daughters of his early-deceased elder brother sir John. Baron Lawrence married countess Agneta Horn, daughter of the Count of Pori. In division of inheritances, their son did not receive Finnish properties, which were assigned to various daughters and nieces. Of Lawrence and Agneta's daughters, baroness Bridget (Brita Cruus) married count Fabian Wrede, count of Elim√§.

It was named for David Sarnoff, the longtime leader of RCA and NBC. The cornerstone of Sarnoff Corporation's David Sarnoff Research Center in the Princeton vicinity was laid just before the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. That facility, later Sarnoff Corporation headquarters, was the site of several historic developments, including color television, CMOS integrated circuit technology and electron microscopy. Following 47 years as a central research laboratory for its corporate owner RCA (and briefly for successor GE) as RCA Laboratories, in 1988 the David Sarnoff Research Center was transitioned to Sarnoff Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of SRI International. In January 2011, Sarnoff Corporation was integrated into its parent company, SRI International, and continues to engage in similar research and development activities at the Princeton, New Jersey facility. Although located adjacent to Princeton University, the two are not, and have never been, directly affiliated. Science and technology David Sarnoff with the first RCA videotape machine in 1954 To date, two historic technology developments among many that took place at RCA Laboratories have been recognized by the IEEE History Center Milestone Program. The IEEE Milestones in Electrical Engineering and Computing program honors significant technical achievements in areas associated with IEEE. These two are the 1946-1953 invention of Monochrome-Compatible Electronic Color Television and the 1968 invention of the Liquid Crystal Display. Beginning in the 1940s, key aspects of thin film technology were developed at the RCA Laboratories. Thin film technology, including evaporation of thin metal and dielectric materials in a vacuum to coat a surface, was first developed intensively for photoemissive surfaces required for television camera technologies under development at RCA since the 1930s. It was later applied to semiconductor fabrication process development leading, in part, to the historic growth of solid state electronics. In the mid-1950s, while working at the RCA Laboratories, Herbert Kroemer developed key aspects of his theories of heterostructure physics for which he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics. Other pioneering and historic technology developments attributable to the RCA Laboratories and Sarnoff Corporation's David Sarnoff Research Center include development of the electron microscope, the photon- counting photomultiplier, the CCD imager, CMOS integrated circuit technology, and early optoelectronic components such as lasers and LEDs. Corporate history Although the facility existed under the name David Sarnoff Research Center for many years, Sarnoff Corporation was only created as an independently operating business following the purchase by General Electric (GE) of RCA in the late 1980s. The context was RCA's write-off of $100M's of investment in capacitive-pickup videodisc technology. RCA's SelectaVision offering was overtaken by the videocassette recorder, which allowed recording in addition to playback offered by Selectavision disks. This 1983 product failure affected RCA stock at a time when equities markets were advancing strongly, thus paving the way for a GE takeover. In the deal, in which GE gained ownership of NBC, RCA was broken up. GE's Jack Welch disposed of diverse RCA operating businesses. Lockheed Martin acquired RCA's government systems unit in the Philadelphia area. Harris Corporation acquired RCA's semiconductor division, located along Route 202 in New Jersey. Thomson SA, the French company, acquired RCA's consumer electronics division with manufacturing activities in Indianapolis, IN and Lancaster, PA. Regarding the RCA David Sarnoff Research Center, GE did not require an augmentation of GE labs in Schenectady, and Syracuse, NY. In the regional community, interest was expressed in establishing an east-coast \\"Silicon Valley\\", in which the Princeton, NJ David Sarnoff Research Center could play a role. A late-1950s antitrust consent decree had required RCA to provide low-cost licenses for consumer electronics technology, largely television-related, to domestic U.S. competitors. RCA had, however, monetized its intellectual property by selling additional licenses internationally. The David Sarnoff Research Center had continued to provide support to clients to further the inventions described in these patents, and GE wished to maintain these activities of the David Sarnoff Research Center to service the very considerable sizable licensing activity that it acquired along with RCA. To address this need, GE engaged non-profit SRI International as an independent third party. Ultimately, in 1986, GE accepted an SRI International proposal that it acquire the David Sarnoff Research Center by donation, along with sufficient operating funds to maintain the activity for several years. In fact, the patent licensing revenues associated with RCA television technologies significantly exceeded operating costs. GE retained the excess and the David Sarnoff Research Center continue to support the licenses and ensured they maintained their value. A provision of the divestiture was that, should the organization not be profitable five years after it was emancipated from GE, its land (nearly of valuable property) would revert to GE. Sarnoff was able to attain profitability and the deed was transferred to Sarnoff Corporation around 1995. A sizable part of the workforce was reduced by a layoff during the Dot Com Bust that reduced the amount of venture capital available; the company had 800 employees in 2001, and 540 in 2006. At the beginning of 2011, Sarnoff Corporation merged with SRI, ceasing to exist as an independent company. Library Between 1967 and 2010, the David Sarnoff Research Center housed exhibits and archives in the David Sarnoff Library, which was constructed by RCA to display longtime RCA leader and labs namesake David Sarnoff's history. Later contributions by RCA staff and collectors highlighted pioneering electronic and broadcast radio and television innovations at RCA and its laboratories. These were owned and administered by a 501(c)(3) nonprofit board of directors. In 2009, in response to the changing missions of the company and the Library, the latter's board voted to transfer the bulk of its exhibits to The College of New Jersey, and the bulk of its archival collections to the Hagley Museum and Library in Wilmington, Delaware. Some artifacts and the RCA Broadcast Division manuals collection were transferred to the InfoAge Science/History Learning Center; some products of the RCA Victor Division in Camden, New Jersey, were transferred to the Camden County Historical Society; and a 1946 RCA Victor 630-TS was transferred to the New Jersey State Museum.

The area itself consisted of a large number of mines. History Wheal Jane was probably seriously worked for tin from the mid-18th century. Given the complexity of ore formation near granitic emplacements, amounts of arsenic, copper, silver and zinc were also worked at some time. In around 1885, most of the nearby mines became uneconomic. Wheal Jane was able to struggle on for a few years, principally due to its arsenic revenue, but it too succumbed in around 1895. It re-opened in 1906 as part of Falmouth Consolidated, with a modernisation and cost reducing agenda, but it was to close again within a decade. Work recommenced at low intensity in the run up to World War II but interest was turning to more modern processing techniques to recover more tin from what was already available and the old mine spoil was re-worked until 1946. It was re- opened again in 1969 and much development work was done underground and in improving the surface processing facilities and ownership eventually passed to Rio Tinto Zinc. Like the remainder of Cornwall's tin mines (Geevor, Pendarves and South Crofty), it was dealt a body blow by the end of the International Tin Agreement in 1985 and the subsequent collapse of the world tin price. It never really recovered and the pumps were finally switched off in early January 1992. Aftermath Wheal Jane was not out of the news though; these were the days before Environmental Impact Assessments. With the pumps no longer de-watering the mine, groundwater levels rose and flooded the former working areas, picking up waste, washing over the exposed rock faces and contaminating the groundwater. These eventually overtopped the drainage systems in January 1992 and acid mine drainage rose through the abandoned mine, escaped into the surface water systems, and flowed into the Carnon river and eventually into Falmouth Bay, killing fish and contaminating wild fowl. By 1994, remedial measures including the construction of large settling ponds, were in place. By 2002 the water treatment had cost more than ¬£20 million.

Education Elliott Montroll was born on May 4, 1916 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and received his elementary and high school education at the Dormont Public Schools. In 1933 he entered the University of Pittsburgh and in 1937 he received a BS degree in Chemistry. From 1937 until 1939 he was a graduate assistant in the Mathematics Department of the University of Pittsburgh, and during the first semester of the school year 1939‚Äì1940 he carried out research in the Chemistry Department of Columbia University. He was awarded a Ph.D in mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh in 1939, with a thesis Some Notes and Applications of the Characteristic Value Theory of Integral Equations in which he applied integral equations to the study of imperfect gases. A paper published jointly with Joseph E. Mayer in 1941 Statistical mechanics of imperfect gases also examined ideas developing out of his thesis. Career Montroll had an exceptionally varied career: was a Sterling Research Fellow at Yale University where his work on the Ising model of a ferromagnet led him to solve certain Markov chain problems. Following this he was a Research Associate at Cornell University in 1941‚Äì42 where he began his studies of the problem of finding the frequency spectrum of elastic vibrations in crystal lattices. During 1942‚Äì43 Montroll was an instructor in physics at Princeton University. In 1943, Montroll was appointed as Head of the Mathematics Research Group at the Kellex Corporation in New York, working on programs associated with the Manhattan Project. In 1944 he went to the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, as adjunct professor of chemistry, then in 1946 he returned to the University of Pittsburgh as assistant, and then associate, professor of physics and mathematics. During this time he also served as head of the Physics Branch of the Office of Naval Research from 1948 to 1950. In 1950 he was appointed as a research fellow at the Courant Institute in New York. In 1951 he was appointed Research Professor in the Institute for Fluid Dynamics and Applied Mathematics at the University of Maryland. However, in 1960, he took the post of Director of General Sciences at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. In 1963 he held the position of Vice President for Research at the Institute for Defense Analysis in Washington, D.C. In 1966, he returned to the academic world as 'Albert Einstein Professor of Physics, and the Director of the Institute for Fundamental Studies, at the University of Rochester. Montroll stayed at the University of Rochester until 1981. After retirement, he accepted two further positions, one back at the University of Maryland and the other at the University of California, Irvine Honors He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences (United States) in 1969, and to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1973. His work on traffic flow led to him winning (jointly) the Lanchester Prize of the Operations Research Society of America in 1959. Personal life He was married to Shirley Abrams on May 7, 1943. He was the father of ten including John Montroll. Has one sister Madelyn Montroll. Now Madelyn Todd.

History  The Burnaby Lake Rugby Club was formed in 1994 when two Metro Vancouver rugby clubs, the Burnaby Buffaloes and the Vancouver Trojans, merged. Because the Buffaloes played in the Fraser Valley Rugby Union and the Trojans played in the Vancouver Rugby Union, these two clubs did not have long-standing rivalries, which accounted a great deal for the success of the merger. As a result of the merger the newly formed Burnaby Lake Rugby Club (BLRC) became one of the larger clubs in the Metro Vancouver Area, consistently fielding teams at the most competitive levels in British Columbia. The BLRC also has a long-standing association with Justice Rugby Club. The Justice Rugby Club is a social rugby club, that plays non-league invitational matches in Canada and abroad. The membership of Justice Rugby consists of police officers in the Metro Vancouver area and their friends. Many of these members are also members of the BLRC. The Burnaby Lake Rugby Club first played in the Fraser Valley Rugby Union (FVRU) after the merger in 1994. However, the BLRC membership voted to join the Vancouver Rugby Union (VRU) during the 1995/1996 Annual General Meeting and the BLRC was accepted as a member of the VRU in 1996, where it has stayed a member since.  Teams  The BLRC fields four Senior Men's teams. The Premier XV and First XV play in the British Columbia CDI Premier League. The BLRC's Third XV and Third XV(B), are part of the Lower Mainland 3rd Division League. Burnaby Lake have been crowned Provincial Champions and have had all teams make play off's and finals BLRC is represented in the Premier Division of BC Rugby Women's League. In 2003, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2013 the BLRC Senior Women won the BC Premier Women's Provincial Championship. The club also fields a Women's team in the Lower Mainland Second Division League that focuses on player development. The BLRC has a mini Rugby program (ages 5 ‚Äì 12) that aims to teach young rugby players the basics of running and passing, as well as the laws of the game. The club also fields teams in the U-14, U-16, U-17 and U-19 Lower Mainland Leagues. Rugby Sevens in BC is played at tournaments throughout the Summer in a points format similar to the IRB Sevens series. The BLRC Lighthouse Sevens program have been perennial contenders in both Elite Men's and Women's Divisions. The Men have been crowned Champions 5 times and the women 4 times since the Series began in 2009.  Facilities  BLRC facility consists of two dedicated match pitches and a lit all weather turf practice field. The clubhouse is situated at the Burnaby Lake Sports Complex in Burnaby.

An unknown species of gigantic octopus has been hypothesized as a source of reports of sea monsters such as the lusca, kraken and akkorokamui as well as the source of some of the carcasses of unidentified origin known as globsters like the St. Augustine Monster. The species that the St. Augustine carcass supposedly represented has been assigned the binomial names \\"Octopus giganteus\\" () and \\"Otoctopus giganteus\\" (Greek prefix: oton = ear; giant-eared octopus), although these are not valid under the rules of the ICZN.

The gigantic octopus is hypothesized to be much larger. History In 1802, the French malacologist Pierre Denys de Montfort in Histoire Naturelle G√©n√©rale et Particuli√®re des Mollusques, an encyclopedic description of mollusks, recognized the existence of two kinds of giant octopus. One being the kraken octopus, which Denys de Montfort believed had been described not only by Norwegian sailors and American whalers, but also by ancient writers such as Pliny the Elder.

Kroger, 437 U.S. 365 (1978), is a case that was decided by the United States Supreme Court regarding the civil procedure subject of ancillary jurisdiction..  Facts  Respondent Kroger, a citizen of Iowa, filed suit against the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD), a Nebraska utility company. Her suit was to recover damages for the wrongful death of her husband, who was electrocuted while walking next to a crane whose boom came too close to a power line. OPPD, which owned the power line, filed a third- party complaint against Owen Equipment & Erection Co., which owned and operated the crane. Kroger then amended her complaint to name Owen as an additional defendant. While Owen initially stated that it was a Nebraska corporation, it was later found that Owen's principal place of business was in fact in Iowa, thus destroying the diversity of citizenship required for jurisdiction under .  Procedure  When confronted with a motion to dismiss for lack of complete diversity, the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska reserved ruling until the end of the trial. Following a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff, the federal district court in an unreported decision denied the motion to dismiss on diversity grounds. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.  Issue  Whether a court can hear a plaintiff's claim against a third-party defendant when there is no independent basis for federal jurisdiction over that claim in an action in which federal jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship, a circumstance called ancillary jurisdiction.  Holding  Whereas the Eighth Circuit relied on United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, , the Supreme Court in its 7 to 2 majority decision written by Justice Potter Stewart limited Gibbs to pendent jurisdiction, bringing state claims in addition to a federal claim. The Court set forth two limits on ancillary jurisdiction beyond the \\"common nucleus of operative fact\\" of Gibbs. First, the non-federal claim must be \\"ancillary and dependent\\" on the original claim rather than \\"new and independent\\", and second, courts can be more lenient to defendants than to plaintiffs because plaintiffs choose where the claims will be brought. In this instance, Kroger was a plaintiff who had chosen federal court and the claim against Owen was \\"entirely separate\\" from her original claim against OPPD \\"since [Owen's] liability to her depended not at all upon whether or not OPPD was also liable.\\" Thus, the court generally upheld the complete diversity requirement of (a)(1) but allowed certain limited exceptions for ancillary jurisdiction. Kroger, however, did not meet those exceptions.  Dissent  Justice White dissented, stating that the majority overlooked such factors as convenience, judicial economy, and considerations of fairness in order to rigidly uphold legislation.  Subsequent History  The majority's holding on ancillary jurisdiction was subsequently codified by Congress in (b) as part of its supplemental jurisdiction statute.  Carter Lake  The Court noted that geography had caused the issue. Owen was based in Carter Lake, Iowa, which is west of the Missouri River. Although the Missouri River generally is the boundary between Iowa and Nebraska, the river in 1877 had avulsed one of its bends, cutting off the land that later became the city of Carter Lake on the western side. The Supreme Court six years earlier had mentioned the circumstances of Carter Lake when it ruled on a boundary dispute between the two states in Nebraska v. Iowa, 406 U.S. 117 (1972).

Amangkurat II (died 1703) was the Susuhunan of Mataram (later Kartasura) from 1677 to 1703. Prior to taking the throne, he was the crown prince and had the title Pangeran Adipati Anom. He was the first Javanese monarch to wear European-style uniform, thus gaining nickname Sunan Amral. Amral is Javanese rendering for \\"admiral\\".  Genealogy  Born as Raden Mas Rahmat, he was the son of Amangkurat I of Mataram and Ratu Kulon, daughter of Pangeran Pekik of Surabaya. Amangkurat II had many wives, but he only had one children, i.e. RM. Sutikna (later Amangkurat III). According to Babad Tanah Jawi, RM. Sutikna's mother had used magic on another wives of Amangkurat II until they were barren.  Conflict within family  RM. Rahmat was raised in Surabaya. He then moved to Plered Palace as adipati anom (crown prince). However, his relation with his brother, Prince Singasari, worsened. There was also a news that poaition of crown prince would be transferred to Prince Singasari. In 1661, RM. Rahmat rebelled to his father, supported by anti-Amangkurat I faction. The small rebellion could be suppressed. But, Amangkurat I failed when he attempted to poison RM. Rahmat in 1663, and made their relation worsened. In 1668, RM. Rahmat fell in love with Rara Oyi, a Surabaya girl who would become his father's concubine. Pangeran Pekik abducted her to be married with RM. Rahmat. This made Amangkurat I angered and murdered Pangeran Pekik and his family. RM. Rahmat was pardoned after he was forced to murder Rara Oyi with his own hand. Alliance with Trunajaya Amangkurat I also relinquished the position of crown prince from RM. Rahmat, and transferred it to Prince Puger (future Pakubuwono I). In 1670, RM. Rahmat asked Panembahan Rama, a spiritual teacher originated from Kajoran family, for help. Panembahan Rama introduced his former son-in-law, Trunajaya of Madura, to be his assistant. In 1674, Karaeng Galesong of Makassar and his followers came to Mataram. They requested a track of land in Mataram, but rejected by Amangkurat I. They were hurted by the refusal and joined with Trunajaya, who rebelled in the east. RM. Rahmat secretly gave them a track of land in Demung, Besuki (now in Situbondo Regency). With the merging of Karaeng Galesong, Trunajaya force became larger and hard to control. RM. Rahmat were anxious and decided to join with his father's side. He regained his position as crown prince, because Prince Puger was born from a mother originated from Kajoran family, which supported the rebellion. With the reunion of RM. Rahmat to his father, Amangkurat I, the rebellion of Trunajaya and Karaeng Galesong became more violent. Ultimately, Trunajaya invaded Plered Palace on July 2, 1677. Amangkurat I and RM. Rahmat themselves escaped to the west, while the palace was defended by Prince Puger as a proof that not all members of Kajoran family supported Trunajaya. However, Prince Puger himself was ousted to Kajenar. End of Trunajaya rebellion Amangkurat II became monarch in 1677 at the height of the Trunajaya rebellion. He succeeded his father, Amangkurat I, who died in Tegal after being expelled from Plered, his capital by Raden Trunajaya, a prince from Madura that captured the court in 1677. According to Babad Tanah Jawi, Amangkurat I's death was caused by poison in his beverage, given by RM. Rahmat, his own son. Despite of that, RM. Rahmat was still chosen as his successor, but accompanied by a curse that none of his descendants never became a monarch but his short-term son. In Tegal, RM. Rahmat was welcomed by Martalaya, Regent of Tegal. RM. Rahmat initially planned to make a pilgrim (hajj) instead of fighting against Trunajaya. But he suddenly cancelled his plan, reportedly because he got wahyu keprabon (divine mandate). RM. Rahmat then implemented his father's will to collaborate with Dutch East India Company. Like his father, Amangkurat II was nearly helpless, having fled without an army nor a treasury to build one. In an attempt to regain his kingdom, he made substantial concessions to the Dutch East India Company (VOC), who then went to war to reinstate him. In September 1677, a treaty was signed in Jepara. The Dutch East India company was represented by Cornelis Speelman. Most northern coast of Java, straddling between Karawang Regency and Panarukan, Situbondo Regency, was mortgaged to Dutch East India Company as a guarantee of payment of war cost. For the Dutch, a stable Mataram empire that was deeply indebted to them would help ensure continued trade on favorable terms. They were willing to lend their military might to keep the kingdom together. The multinational Dutch forces, consisting of light-armed troops from Makasar and Ambon, in addition to heavily equipped European soldiers, first defeated Trunajaya in Kediri in November 1678, and Trunajaya himself was captured in 1679 near Ngantang west of Malang, and killed by Amangkurat II with his own hand on January 2, 1680. Giri Kedaton rebellion Giri Kedaton, which became Mataram's vassal since Sultan Agung era, had supported Trunajaya rebellion. Panembahan Ageng Giri actively looked for support to strengthen rebels' force. Upon accession to throne, Amangkurat II came to Kadilangu, Demak Regency, to meet Panembahan Natapraja, a wise, invulnerable, and smart elder who had soldiers who were ready to help Amangkurat I. Panembahan Natapraja, as a descendant of Sunan Kalijaga, were asked to rewrite history of Java because the original manuscript had been burned by rebels. This became the origin of Babad Tanah Jawi as known in the next era. Amangkurat II also made an alliance and treaty with Dutch East India Company to gain weaponry support to make a revenge toward Giri Kedaton. Giri Kedaton became the last Trunajaya ally to have a large force. In April 1680, Panembahan Natapraja made a large-scale invasion toward Giri Kedaton, supported by Dutch East India Company who helped Amangkurat II. The best commander who was also a reliable disciple of Giri Kedaton was Prince Singosari (Senopati Singosekar), a strong and invulnerable warrior. He was eventually killed in action after duelling with Panembahan Natapraja. Panembahan Natapraja's soldiers were small, but they were able to devastate Giri Kedaton. Panembahan Ageng Giri was captured and sentenced to death by whip. His family was also exterminated. This marked the end of Giri Kedaton. Building new palace Since the fallen Plered was considered inauspicious, Amangkurat II built a new palace in Wanakarta forest, and moved the capital to Kartasura in the land of Pajang (the northern part of the stretch of land between Mount Merapi and Mount Lawu, the southern part being Mataram).see also the subsequent later move from Kartasura to Surakarta in chapter one of Prince Puger, who initially stayed in Kajenar, moved to Plered after being left by Trunajaya. He refused to join with Amangkurat II because he heard a news that Amangkuray II wasn't RM. Rahmat (his half- brother), rather Cornelis Speelman's son disguised as RM. Rahmat. The confusing news ultimately caused a chaotic condition. The war between Plered and Kartasura occurred in November 1680. Babad Tanah Jawi mentions it as a war between Mataram and Kartasura. Then, in 1681, the alliance of Dutch and Amangkurat II forced Prince Puger, his younger half-brother, who styled himself Susuhunan ing Alaga when he seized the throne, to relinquish it after he surrendered in November 28, 1681. Babad Tanah Jawi relates that Mataram Sultanate had fallen in 1677, and Sunanate of Kartasura was a new successor of Mataran, legitimized by Panembahan Natapraja of Kadilangu who was considered as Mataram elder. Attitude toward the Dutch Javanese chronicles depicts Amangkurat II as a weak ruler who was easy to influence. Prince Puger, his half-brother, had a more role in government. Amangkurat II ascended to throne with Dutch help and left a debt for war cost as high as 2.5 million guilders. An anti-Dutch official, Patih Nerangkusuma, was successful to persuade him to free from the debt. In 1683, Wanakusuma, a Kajoran family member, rebelled. His Gunung Kidul-based rebellion was successfully suppressed. By providing help in regaining his throne, the Dutch brought Amangkurat II under their tight control. Amangkurat II was apparently unhappy with the situation, especially the increasing Dutch control of the coast, but he was helpless in the face of a crippling financial debt and the threat of Dutch military power. The king engaged in a series of intrigues to try to weaken the Dutch position without confronting them head on. For example, he tried to cooperate with other kingdoms such as Cirebon and Johor, and the court sheltered people wanted by the Dutch for attacking colonial offices or disrupting shipping, such as Untung Surapati. Amangkurat II gave him a residence in Babirong village, and Untung Surapati arranged his strength there. In 1685, Batavia (now Jakarta) sent Captain Francois Tack, the officer who captured Trunajaya, to Amangkurat's court at Kartasura, in order to capture Surapati and negotiate further details into the agreement between VOC and Amangkurat II. Fran√ßois Tack was killed when pursuing Surapati in Kartasura, but Batavia decided to do nothing since the situation in Batavia itself was far from stable, such as the insurrection of Captain Jonker, native commander of Ambonese settlement in Batavia, in 1689. Mainly due to this incident, by the end of his reign, Amangkurat II was deeply distrusted by the Dutch, but Batavia were similarly uninterested in provoking another costly war on Java. Amangkurat II then approved Untung Suropati and Nerangkusuma to seize Pasuruan Regency. Anggajaya, Regent of Pasuruan who was initially appointed by Amangkurat II himself had to be victim. He escaped to Surabaya, joined with his brother, Anggawangsa alias Duke Jangrana. The ambiguous attitude of Amangkurat II was discovered by Dutch East India Company, who found Amangkurat II's letters to Sultanates of Cirebon, Johor, Palembang, and Kingdom of England, which urged to wage a war with Dutch Republic. Amangkurat II also supported Captain Jonker's revolt in 1689. The Dutch East India Company made a pressure to Kartasura to pay war cost as high as 2.5 million guilders. Amangkurat II himself attempted to improve the relation by pretending to invade Untung Suropati in Pasuruan. Death Amangkurat II died in 1703 and was briefly succeeded by his son, Amangkurat III (r. 1703-1705), whose reign was marked by First Javanese War of Succession.

He was the lord of Cappacio, Muro, and Montalbano in the Kingdom of Naples. Captured in 1350 at the siege of Aversa, he was held prisoner by Louis I of Hungary until 1352. After his release, he took refuge with his uncle the Cardinal de P√©rigord in Avignon, which had just been sold to the Papacy by Joan I of Naples. His uncle attempted to arrange a marriage for him with the niece of Giovanni Visconti, lord of Milan, but on his journey to Milan, Robert was arrested by James of Piedmont. James' wife, Sibylle des Baux, was convinced that Robert and his Durazzeschi kin had arranged the recent murder of her nephew Robert, Count of Avellino. (Robert had married, by force, Maria of Calabria; but falling into the hands of Louis of Taranto, was murdered by his wife's orders in the Castel dell'Ovo.) Robert was not released until 18 March 1355, through the efforts of his uncle and Pope Innocent VI, and was made to swear to take no revenge on his captors. He immediately broke the promise by seizing the fortress of Les Baux on 6 April 1355. This was the Proven√ßal seat of Raymond des Baux, brother and successor of the murdered Robert. The Pope was outraged; Robert was defended by his uncle in the papal curia, but did not escape excommunication. After an unsuccessful attempt at mediation by Walter VI of Brienne and others, local levies besieged the castle, and by July, Robert was compelled to surrender it to its rightful owner. He accompanied the Cardinal to the Battle of Poitiers. Before the battle, the Cardinal attempted to mediate between the English forces under Edward, the Black Prince and the French forces under John II of France. Robert, like many of the Cardinal's men, joined the fight on the French side, and was killed there. This violation of the neutrality which ought to adhere to a churchman and mediator so provoked Edward the Black Prince that he had Robert's body borne on a shield to the Cardinal as a mocking salute.

Originally owned by BAA USA, (then a subsidiary of BAA plc.) it was then owned by the New York-based investment company Prospect Capital Corporation. In August 2014 AirMall was acquired by the German Fraport Group, operator of Frankfurt International Airport and another 10 airports around the globe. Its first AirMall opened at the Pittsburgh International Airport in 1992. Today the company also operates AIRMALLs at Baltimore/Washington International Airport and Boston's Logan International Airport, however Pittsburgh remains by far the largest. An AirMall opened at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in the spring of 2009 as well. The stores in the AirMall are known for pricing their merchandise the same as they would at a store in a typical retail setting, compared to the higher prices charged at restaurants and gift shops in other airports. Pittsburgh International Airport Opened along with the new airport in 1992, the AirMall in Pittsburgh is the largest airport shopping complex in the United States.http://www.baausa.com/Content/PittsburghInternationalAirport.aspx It is located within the airport's airside terminal, mostly in the \\"Center Core\\" area, with some shops and restaurants extending into the concourses. Prior to 9/11, and the opening of The Mall at Robinson, the Airmall served as a shopping destination for residents of the western suburbs of Pittsburgh. Because the Airmall is located beyond the security checkpoint, where only ticketed passengers and authorized personnel had been permitted for more than a decade after 9/11, and the reduction of the use of Pittsburgh International as a US Airways hub, sales have decreased in recent years. On April 13, 2007, it was announced that guests staying at the attached airport Hyatt hotel would be able to obtain passes to shop during their stay. Even with sales being down due to US Airways cutbacks and the Great Recession, the AirMall in Pittsburgh still accounts for the highest per passenger spending of any airport in the country, at an average of $13.60/passenger. In 2017, Pittsburgh International became the first US commercial airport to allow the general public access to the area beyond the checkpoint. Visitors must first sign up for the \\"myPITpass\\" program on the airport's website; following approval, they must still pass the same security checks required of ticketed passengers.

This was Carlin's \\"first real book\\" and contains much of Carlin's stand-up comedy material. According to the cover, the book contains \\"jokes, notions, doubts, opinions, questions, thoughts, beliefs, assertions, assumptions, and disturbing references\\" and \\"comedy, nonsense, satire, mockery, merriment, sarcasm, ridicule, silliness, bluster, and toxic alienation\\". For longtime Carlin fans, the book also contains complete versions of two of his most famous monologues, \\"A Place for My Stuff\\" and \\"Baseball and Football\\". The hardcover edition was on the New York Times Bestseller List for 18 straight weeks. The following year, the paperback edition was published. It stayed on the New York Times Bestseller List for 20 weeks. Both editions were published by Hyperion. As of January 2001, the book had sold over 750,000 total copies. Writer and television commentator Mike Barnicle supposedly lifted material from the book, without accreditation, and presented it as his own. He denied having read the book, but footage of Barnicle praising the book and saying \\"There's a yuk on every page\\" turned up. Barnicle was suspended for the action. In August 1998, Hyperion published a 1999 calendar containing quips and quotes from the book. In May 2000, the book was published as an audiobook by HighBridge,\\"Brain Droppings.\\" Publishers Weekly 247.23 (2000): 62. General OneFile (accessed 27 December 2009). in both CD and cassette tape formats. The audiobook received a Grammy award, Carlin's third, in February 2001. Differences in audiobook Since there was a 3-year gap between the printed book and the audiobook, a few things were changed due to changes in both Carlin's personal life and in the world in general. *His wife, Brenda, died shortly after the book was published, so in the audiobook he said \\"I've had a great marriage...\\" instead of \\"I have...\\" *He mentions being happy the Yankees annihilated the Braves in the World Series in the book, but mentions it happened twice in the audiobook as the two teams played again in 1999. *In mentioning teams who could never quite win the big title after so many years, he mentions the Vikings, the Broncos, the Bills, the Cubs, and the Red Sox in the book. In the audiobook, he omits the Broncos when they win two Super Bowls. *At the end of his discussion of when super celebrities die, in the book he says he can't even fathom Frank Sinatra's or Ronald Reagan's death. He omitted Sinatra in the audiobook after he died in 1998. *In a non-chronological change, in his \\"Baseball and Football\\" segment, he adds the weird fact that baseball is the only one of the four major American sports that is sensibly unwatchable in a mirror.

Originally an outdoor equestrian center and riding academy, the building was enclosed and converted into an ice arena which opened in January 1938. It was the original home of the Colorado College Tigers hockey team, as well as the Broadmoor Skating Club, a major force in the figure skating community. The building served as the first home of the NCAA Hockey Championships, hosting the first ten Final Fours (1948-1957) and once more, in 1969. The arena served as host to the International Ice Hockey Federation World Championships in 1962. It also hosted the World Figure Skating Championships five times between 1957 and 1975. With wooden seats, red aisle carpeting and wildlife paintings on the walls, the arena had an intimate atmosphere that reflected its lakeside, resort hotel setting. The arena was the primary arena setting in the 1978 movie Ice Castles. In 1993, the Broadmoor announced that it would be closing the arena to make room for a $27 million expansion of the resort. It closed in March 1994. The last major event held at the arena was the 1994 World Junior Figure Skating Championships. The Tigers moved their hockey games to the similarly-named World Arena.

Federal Communications Commission, 395 U.S. 367 (1969), upheld the equal time provisions of the Fairness Doctrine, ruling that it was \\"the right of the public to receive suitable access to social, political, esthetic, moral, and other ideas and experiences.\\". However, it strongly suggested that broadcast radio stations (and, by logical extension, television stations) are First Amendment speakers whose editorial speech is protected. In upholding the Fairness Doctrine, the Court based its rationale partly on a scarce radio spectrum. The FCC, by administrative rulemaking, had required that discussion of public issues be presented on broadcast stations, and that each side of those issues must be given fair coverage. As a result, the FCC added an \\"equal time rule\\" and a \\"response to personal attack\\" rule. Red Lion Broadcasting Co. challenged these rules as unconstitutionally infringing on the speech of the station's editorial judgment. Justice Byron White, writing for the majority, explained: \\"the FCC has included among the conditions of the Red Lion license itself the requirement that operation of the station be carried out in the public interest.\\"Red Lion Broadcasting Co., 395 U.S. at 380.  Parties Involved  Petitioner: Red Lion Broadcasting Company, et al. Respondent: Federal Communications Commission, et al. Chief Lawyer for Petitioner: Roger Robb Chief Lawyer for Respondent: Archibald Cox Justices for the Court: Hugo Lafayette Black, William J. Brennan, Jr., John Marshall Harlan II, Thurgood Marshall, Potter Stewart, Earl Warren, Byron R. White (writing for the Court) Justices Dissenting: None (William O. Douglas did not participate)  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of the FCC against the broadcaster, and found the Fairness Doctrine to be constitutional. Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court and came to the conclusion that the federal government could place restrictions on broadcasters that could not be placed on ordinary individuals. He stated that \\"without government control, the medium would be of little use because of the cacophony of competing voices, none of which could be clearly and predictably heard.\\" It was decided that even though broadcasting is a medium that is affected by the First Amendment, the differences in broadcasting justify differences in the application of the First Amendment. Justice White also explained that it is the rights of the viewers and listeners that is the most important, not the rights of the broadcasters. The Court did not see how the Fairness Doctrine went against the First Amendments goal of creating an informed public. The Fairness Doctrine required that those who were talked about be given chance to respond to the statements made by broadcasters. The Court believed that this helped create a more informed public. Justice White explained that without this doctrine, station owners would only have people on the air who agreed with their opinions. Throughout his opinion, Justice White discussed the scarcity of radio frequencies. He argued that these frequencies should be used to educate the public about controversial issues in a way that is fair and non-biased so that they can create their own opinions.  Decision  \\"Even where there are gaps in spectrum utilization, the fact remains that existing broadcasters have often attained their present position because of their initial government selection in competition with others before new technological advances opened new opportunities for further uses. Long experience in broadcasting, confirmed habits of listeners and viewers, network affiliation, and other advantages in program procurement give existing broadcasters a substantial advantage over new entrants, even where new entry is technologically possible. These advantages are the fruit of a preferred position conferred by the Government. Some present possibility for new entry by competing stations is not enough, in itself, to render unconstitutional the Government's effort to assure that a broadcaster's programming ranges widely enough to serve the public interest. In view of the scarcity of broadcast frequencies, the Government's role in allocating those frequencies, and the legitimate claims of those unable without governmental assistance to gain access to those frequencies for expression of their views, we hold the regulations and ruling at issue here are both authorized by statute and constitutional. The judgment of the Court of Appeals in Red Lion is affirmed and that in RTNDA [US v. Radio Television News Directors Association] reversed and the causes remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\" Official syllabus The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has for many years imposed on broadcasters a \\"fairness doctrine,\\" requiring that public issues be presented by broadcasters and that each side of those issues be given fair coverage. In No. 2, the FCC declared that petitioner Red Lion Broadcasting Co. had failed to meet its obligation under the fairness doctrine when it carried a program which constituted a personal attack on one Cook (journalist Fred J. Cook), and ordered it to send a transcript of the broadcast to Cook and provide reply time, whether or not Cook would pay for it. The Court of Appeals upheld the FCC's position. After the commencement of the Red Lion litigation the FCC began a rule-making proceeding to make the personal attack aspect of the fairness doctrine more precise and more readily enforceable, and to specify its rules relating to political editorials. The rules, as adopted and amended, were held unconstitutional by the Court of Appeals in RTNDA (No. 717), as abridging the freedoms of speech and press. Held: 1\\\\. The history of the fairness doctrine and of related legislation shows that the FCC's action in the Red Lion case did not exceed its authority, and that in adopting the new regulations the FCC was implementing congressional policy. pp. 375‚Äì386. (a) The fairness doctrine began shortly after the Federal Radio Commission was established to allocate frequencies among competing applicant in the public interest, and insofar as there is an affirmative obligation of the broadcaster to see that both sides are presented, the personal attack doctrine and regulations do not differ from the fairness doctrine. pp. 375‚Äì379. (b) The FCC's statutory mandate to see that broadcasters operate in the public interest and Congress' reaffirmation, in the 1959 amendment to 315 of the Communications Act, of the FCC's view that the fairness doctrine inhered in the public interest standard, support the conclusion that the doctrine and its component personal attack and political editorializing regulations are a legitimate exercise of congressionally delegated authority. pp. 379‚Äì386. 2\\\\. The fairness doctrine and its specific manifestations in the personal attack and political editorial rules do not violate the First Amendment. pp. 386‚Äì401. (a) The First Amendment is relevant to public broadcasting, but it is the right of the viewing and listening public, and not the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount. pp. 386‚Äì390. (b) The First Amendment does not protect private censorship by broadcasters who are licensed by the Government to use a scarce resource which is denied to others. pp. 390‚Äì392. (c) The danger that licensees will eliminate coverage of controversial issues as a result of the personal attack and political editorial rules is at best speculative, and, in any event, the FCC has authority to guard against this danger. pp. 392‚Äì395. (d) There was nothing vague about the FCC's specific ruling in the Red Lion case and the regulations at issue in No. 717 could be employed in precisely the same way as the fairness doctrine in Red Lion. It is not necessary to decide every aspect of the fairness doctrine to decide these cases. Problems involving more extreme applications or more difficult constitutional questions will be dealt with if and when they arise. pp. 395‚Äì396. (e) It has not been shown that the scarcity of broadcast frequencies, which impelled governmental regulation, is entirely a thing of the past, as new uses for the frequency spectrum have kept pace with improved technology and more efficient utilization of that spectrum. pp. 396‚Äì400.

Items can be concealed in books in a number of ways. Small items such as a photograph or a note can be hidden in between the pages of the book. Thicker items can be hidden by removing the interior portion of some or all of the pages, creating a book safe or hollowed-out book. Book safes are easy for their owners to recognise, but they do not stand out to a thief or other intruder. Another type of concealment is the hiding of messages in the text or on a book's pages by printing in code -- a form of steganography. For example, letters could be underlined on sequential pages, with the letters spelling out a message or code. There are a number of actual and fictional examples of items or messages having been concealed in a book. Illicit chemicals may be smuggled by soaking individual pages with them. Books are used as a concealment device in part because they are readily available and inconspicuous in many settings. Methods of concealment =Hollow book safes= Prices can vary based on the cost of materials, additional features, and resources used to create the functionality and aesthetics of the hollow book. The main functional purpose aims for the containment of valuables, memorable items, or contraband within the cloak of an ordinary book. Thus maintaining privacy and security from unwanted intrusions and/or theft. The scale of gadgetry used to create the seal of a hollow book's closing properties have ranged from simple to complex. Simple elastic bands, interlocking rope, and other common book closing techniques are used. Other times, hidden magnets do the task as well as the unusual use of complex locking mechanisms that require a lock and key combinations have also been used to keep a book closed. Material choices used in the creation of the hollow book's body are usually actual books. However, other plastic, metal, cardboard, or paper materials have also been used to either simulate a real book, or to be used as extra features. Many book safes are handmade. Structures made from real books are sealed and pressed before hollowing the inside pages with a sharp cutting utility. Sealing the back and allowing the front cover to act as a door that can be opened and shut. While other hollow books are made from cardboard cigar boxes, simulating a book on the outside. =Steganography and hidden messages= Genesis 26:5-10 in a 21-column grid and the words \\"Bible\\" and \\"code\\" are revealed. Other arrangements can yield many other words. Messages can be hidden within a book using steganographic techniques. Invisible ink may be used to write words and sentences in the book, or by underlining certain words or letters a message can be crafted. The author of a book may include coded messages by carefully choosing the wording, such as in a simple acrostic where the first letter of each word spells another word. There have been many claims of a Bible code, alleging that God secretly placed hidden messages in the Torah, and that these can be discovered by suitable manipulations of the text. The 1997 book The Bible Code by Michael Drosnin is one of the most famous examples. On the other hand, it has been shown one may discover \\"hidden messages\\" in any book using this method.Bible code and criticisms page Choice of book In fictional uses of book safes, the title or subject of the book can be symbolic or related to the nature of the object, e.g., hidden money in a copy of The Wealth of Nations.

Harrison wrote the song as a sequel to his popular Beatles composition \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", in response to the personal criticism he had received during and after his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar, particularly from Rolling Stone magazine. An edit of \\"This Guitar\\" was issued as a single in December 1975, as the final release by Apple Records in its original incarnation. The single failed to chart in either the United States or Britain. The song follows in a tradition established by singers such as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, of attributing emotions and actions to a musical instrument. The lyrics also serve as an example of a dialogue that was commonplace during the 1970s between songwriters and music critics. Contributing to Harrison's sense of injustice in \\"This Guitar\\", he and his tour musicians believed that detractors had ignored the successful aspects of the 1974 shows ‚Äì which blended rock, jazz, funk and Indian classical music ‚Äì and had focused instead on his failure to pay due respect to the legacy of the Beatles. Rolling Stones scathing assessment of Harrison's tour and accompanying album, Dark Horse, represented an about-face by the publication, previously one of his most vocal supporters, and led to Harrison's continued resentment towards the magazine over subsequent decades. Harrison recorded \\"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\\" in Los Angeles during April and May 1975, a period marked by his post-tour despondency. The recording features guitar solos played by Harrison and American musician Jesse Ed Davis. The song serves as a rare guitar-oriented selection on the keyboard- heavy Extra Texture album, although David Foster, Gary Wright and Harrison all contributed keyboard parts to the track. \\"This Guitar\\" has traditionally received a mixed reception from reviewers, partly due to the inevitable comparisons with \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\". Harrison re-recorded the song in 1992 with former Eurythmic Dave Stewart, who used it to promote his Platinum Weird project in 2006. This version appears as a bonus track on the 2014 Apple Years 1968‚Äì75 reissue of Extra Texture. Background and inspiration George Harrison's stated aim for his North American tour with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, which took place from 2 November to 20 December 1974,Madinger & Easter, pp. 445‚Äì46. was to offer concert-goers \\"another kind of experience\\" from the typical mid-1970s rock show.Clayson, p. 339. With its blending of Western rock, funk and jazz genres with Indian classical music,Leng, pp. 170, 174. author Robert Rodriguez describes the result as a musical form \\"[that] one day would be called 'world music'\\".Rodriguez, p. 60. Of the critical reception given to the Harrison‚ÄìShankar venture, tour-wide, Rodriguez writes of the \\"genuine highlights that went mostly unreported\\", since: \\"Smaller press outlets without axes to grind tended to review the shows the best, whereas rock establishment coverage, such as Rolling Stones, tended to spin the tour as something close to an unmitigated disaster ...\\"Rodriguez, p. 59.

Harrison biographer Simon Leng describes this phenomenon as \\"one of the stranger episodes in rock music\\" and writes: \\"While the majority of reviews were positive, in some cases ecstatic, the 'given' view of the tour comes from the Rolling Stone articles.\\"Leng, p. 174.

While reviewers of the 1974 concerts had focused on his altering of the lyric to \\"While my guitar gently smiles\\" and \\"... tries to smile\\", Harrison told BBC Radio 1's Paul Gambaccini in September 1975 that it was a track that was consistently well received by audiences during the tour.Badman, p. 164. Harrison described the new composition as \\"Son of 'Guitar Gently Weeps'\\".George Harrison interview, Rockweek, \\"George Harrison explains 'This Guitar Can't Keep from Crying'\\" (retrieved 5 May 2013). Like the Beatles track, \\"This Guitar\\" is structured around short, minor-key verses (in this case, in the key of G minor) that conclude with the song title, rather than distinct choruses. Author Ian Inglis also notes the \\"evident similarity\\" between the melody of the two compositions. As with Harrison's lyrics for \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", Inglis writes, \\"This Guitar\\" follows in a tradition established by Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Bo Diddley, of attributing emotions and actions to a musical instrument.Inglis, p. 51. In a contemporary review, music journalist Ray Coleman said that the song's lyrics, together with the yearning quality of Harrison's singing and guitar playing on the track, \\"will raise questions about its relevance to his personal life\\". The song begins with the lines \\"Found myself out on a limb / But I'm happier than I've ever been\\",George Harrison, p. 311. the second of which echoes Harrison's statement to Fong-Torres that he had never been as happy as he was now ‚Äì in a band with Scott, Billy Preston and Willie Weeks,Badman, p. 138. and as a servant of the Hindu god Krishna instead of living out the public's perception of him as \\"Beatle George\\".Greene, p. 217. In his brief discussion of \\"This Guitar\\" in his autobiography, Harrison introduces the lyrics to verse two with a mention of the need to \\"struggle\\" through adversity, in an effort \\"to become better human beings\\":George Harrison, p. 312. Like Harrison with \\"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\\", Canadian singer Joni Mitchell responded to detractors with a musical response targeted at their past criticism; photo by Paul C. Babin Noting that Harrison was \\"bound to fight back against what he saw as unfair, malicious criticism\\", Leng views these and other lines in the song as typical of a dialogue then common in rock music, between artists and critics.Leng, pp. 177, 181, 186. Leng cites Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and John Lennon as other singer-songwriters who encouraged this dialogue and in some instances suffered for doing so.Leng, pp. 128, 182, 186. Theologian Dale Allison writes of Harrison's \\"deep hurt\\" being reflected in the lyrics to \\"This Guitar\\".Allison, p. 157. The two bridge sections document the \\"unwarranted abuse that comes his way\\", Inglis writes, while typifying the theme that \\"[Harrison] is the guitar\\": After Harrison has named Rolling Stone as the main perpetrator of his anguish,Clayson, p. 350. Leng suggests that he is unable to sustain the previous \\"artifice\\", whereby the lyrics' shift in perspective from first-person to third-person represented the apparently \\"happy\\" private man versus the \\"wounded\\" musician, as \\"personified by his guitar\\".Leng, p. 182. Instead, Harrison \\"flays his detractors\\" in the song's subsequent verses. These final verses contain the rhyming couplets \\"Thought by now you knew the score / You missed the point just like before\\" and \\"While you attack, create offence / I'll put it down to your ignorance\\". Music critic Lindsay Planer describes the lines as \\"suggesting that there is more to Harrison's music than is being taken into consideration by narrow-minded journalists\\". Recording Harrison started recording his follow-up to Dark Horse, Extra Texture (Read All About It), in April 1975, while in Los Angeles working on business associated with his Dark Horse record label.Rodriguez, pp. 247‚Äì48.Madinger & Easter, p. 451. Leng remarks on Harrison's \\"almost unseemly\\" haste in returning to a studio and suggests that his \\"bitterness and dismay\\" post-Dark Horse was evident on much of the recording.Leng, pp. 178, 179. Early on in the sessions, during his radio interview with WNEW-FM's Dave Herman, Harrison bemoaned the abandoning of 1960s idealism within the music industry and related this to the critical backlash he had recently received, from people who were \\"just dropping apart at the seams with hate\\", adding: \\"I'm talking about Rolling Stone actually ‚Äì talking about [founding editor] Jann Wenner.\\"\\"George Harrison ‚Äì Interview (1975)\\", Paste (retrieved 12 November 2016); event occurs between 42:40 and 44:30. Harrison recorded the basic track for \\"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\\" at A&M; Studios in Hollywood between 21 April and 7 May.Spizer, p. 274. Harrison played 12-string acoustic guitar, with support from David Foster on piano, and sparse, floor tom-heavy drumming from Jim Keltner. Klaus Voormann, Harrison's regular bass player and a friend since the Beatles' Hamburg years, chose to not participate in many of the sessions for Extra Texture,Rodriguez, p. 85. later citing the abundance of cocaine and Harrison's \\"frame of mind when he was doing this album\\".Leng, p. 179. Harrison overdubbed the song's bass part using an ARP synthesizer, while Gary Wright provided the ARP strings atmospherics,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 376. a sound that characterised his hit album The Dream Weaver around this time.Leng, p. 194. In the description of author Andrew Grant Jackson, the song's opening synthesizer part \\"wouldn't sound out of place in a '70s horror flick or a Death Wish sequel\\".Jackson, pp. 146‚Äì47. When discussing \\"This Guitar\\" with Paul Gambaccini in London, in September, Harrison described the song as \\"a cheap excuse to play some guitar\\". Harrison played the slide guitar parts throughout the track, including the closing solo.Huntley, p. 124. Leng identifies both \\"Pete Drake stylings\\" and the influence of \\"raga microtones\\" in Harrison's performance. The wah-effected guitar solo midway through the song was performed by Jesse Ed Davis,Rodriguez, p. 280. who, having first supported Harrison at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971, had since mirrored the ex-Beatle's guitar style on John Lennon's recent hit song \\"#9 Dream\\".Leng, p. 159. Davis overdubbed his contribution to \\"This Guitar\\" on 5 June, the day before the Foster-arranged orchestral strings were recorded.Madinger & Easter, p. 452. Release Japanese picture sleeve for \\"This Guitar\\", showing Harrison on stage in 1974 Extra Texture was released on Apple Records in September 1975,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 369. with \\"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\\" sequenced as the third track, between \\"The Answer's at the End\\" and Harrison's Smokey Robinson tribute \\"Ooh Baby (You Know That I Love You)\\".Spizer, pp. 273, 274. Aside from the well-received lead single, \\"You\\",Huntley, pp. 122, 123. the album offered little in the way of \\"hook-laden potential hit[s]\\", author Bruce Spizer writes, leading to \\"This Guitar\\" being chosen as the follow-up single. Apple issued the single on 8 December in America,Badman, p. 172. with the Apple catalogue number 1885.Madinger & Easter, p. 633. For this release, the song was edited down to a running time of 3:49,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 373. by fading out early during the closing solo. The B-side was the Dark Horse track \\"MƒÅya Love\\", a choice that underlined the paucity of radio-friendly selections on Extra Texture, according to Spizer. The single's UK release (as Apple R 6012)Madinger & Easter, p. 632. was delayed until 6 February 1976. \\"This Guitar\\" was the final release for the original Apple record label,Spizer, p. 277. which the Beatles had launched in 1968 as a business enterprise aligned with utopian ideology.Stephen Thomas Erlewine, \\"The Beatles\\", AllMusic (retrieved 16 October 2017). The record's face labels reverted to the generic Apple design rather than use the customised design adopted for \\"You\\" and Extra Texture, which included a vivid orange and blue colour scheme and an eaten- away apple core in place of the standard Apple logo.Spizer, pp. 217, 277. In America and Britain, \\"This Guitar\\" was available only in a plain sleeve. Among the alternative packaging available in other markets, the rare Japanese picture sleeve incorporated the colour scheme from the parent album, surrounding an image of Harrison on stage during the 1974 tour.Peter Doggett, \\"The Apple Years\\", Record Collector, April 2001, p. 40. The picture was taken by tour photographer Henry Grossman,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 102. who worked extensively with the Beatles in the 1960s.Allan Kozinn, \\"The Beatles, Seen From Unusual Angles\\", The New York Times, 31 December 2012 (retrieved 20 September 2017). Harrison did no promotion for the single,Rodriguez, p. 281. but his guest appearance on comedian Eric Idle's Rutland Weekend Television 1975 Christmas special, singing the purpose-written \\"The Pirate Song\\",Madinger & Easter, p. 453. heralded a return to form for him in 1976.Huntley, p. 129. \\"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\\" failed to place on any of the three US singles charts or the UK's official singles chart, then just a top 50.Huntley, p. 122. It was Harrison's first single to miss the Billboard Hot 100,Chaz Lipp, \\"Music Review: George Harrison‚Äôs Apple Albums Remastered\\", Blogcritics, 5 October 2014 (retrieved 13 October 2017). where all his previous releases had charted no lower than number 36,Rodriguez, p. 274.\\"George Harrison: Awards\\" (\\"Billboard Singles\\"), AllMusic (archived version retrieved 13 September 2017). and the first single by a former Beatle not to chart at all in the United States. Rodriguez attributes its lack of success mainly to the fact that Apple was \\"[r]unning on fumes\\" by this point and the company's promotion for the single was nonexistent.Rodriguez, pp. 280‚Äì81. By the time the single appeared in Britain, Harrison's involvement with Apple was officially over,Woffinden, p. 93. following his signing with A&M-distributed; Dark Horse Records in January 1976.Badman, pp. 175‚Äì76. Spizer writes: \\"It was a sad end and [a] far cry from the success of Apple's first release, 'Hey Jude'.\\" Critical reception =Contemporary reviews= Discussing Extra Texture in his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner wrote of Harrison's \\"worldly critics\\" responding \\"like bulls to a red flag\\" to \\"This Guitar\\" and other \\"treatises on how reviewers always 'miss the point'\\". Schaffner added: \\"True, the critics had been unfair, even vicious. But one could only hope George would rise above them, and produce a work good enough to fake them all out. Which is exactly what he would do a year later with Thirty-Three and a Third.\\"Schaffner, p. 182. Rodriguez writes that \\"Critics by nature tended to regard the Beatles' catalog as sacrosanct\\" and therefore \\"dissed [Harrison] for producing a sequel to 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps'\\".Rodriguez, p. 176. In another unfavourable review from Rolling Stone,Huntley, p. 126. Dave Marsh dismissed much of the album's first side as \\"padded subterfuge\\" while opining that \\"there just isn't compensation here for the failed promise of 'This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)'\\".Dave Marsh, \\"George Harrison Extra Texture\\", Rolling Stone, 20 November 1975, p. 75 (retrieved 6 May 2013). NME writers Roy Carr and Tony Tyler said that, in comparison with the Beatles track, Harrison's \\"often-impressively lachrymose guitar falls short of true grief-stricken form here\\", adding: \\"The lack of a tune doesn't help.\\"Carr & Tyler, p. 118. Conversely, Record Worlds single reviewer wrote that Harrison \\"hits the mark with this edited extra textural ballad\\" and highlighted Wright's ARP strings among the \\"superb accompaniment\\" on the recording.\\"Single Picks\\", Record World, 20 December 1975, p. 14. In his review for Melody Maker, Ray Coleman admired it as a \\"scorching track\\" with a lyrical message that he deemed \\"Hot, pertinent, touching\\".Ray Coleman, \\"Extra Texture: Back to the Sixties!\\", Melody Maker, 6 September 1975, p. 30. =Retrospective assessment= AllMusic's Richard Ginell views \\"This Guitar\\" as an \\"attractive\\" sequel to \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and includes it among Harrison's best compositions from his solo career.Richard S. Ginell, \\"George Harrison Extra Texture\\", AllMusic (retrieved 6 May 2013). Andrew Grant Jackson features the track in his book Still the Greatest: The Essential Solo Beatles Songs. He recognises Harrison's bitterness towards his detractors as a common trait among the former Beatles, and \\"desperation\\" in his revisiting a revered Beatles song to air his grievances. Jackson nevertheless admires \\"the group's synergy\\" on the recording, as well as Forster's string arrangement, saying: \\"['This Guitar'] could have been one of the most depressing ex-Beatles tunes ever, but its strange groove compels repeated listening.\\"Jackson, pp. 146, 147. Robert Rodriguez considers it to be a \\"fine track\\" containing one of Harrison's \\"finest vocal performances\\", yet he also identifies an unwelcome \\"air of defensiveness, bordering on arrogance\\" in the lyrics. Writing in Mojo magazine, John Harris describes \\"This Guitar\\" as a \\"serviceable sequel\\" in which Harrison \\"1) does a neat Dylan impression, and 2) plays yet another lovely slide solo\\".John Harris, \\"Beware of Darkness\\", Mojo, November 2011, p. 82. Reviewing the 2014 Apple Years reissues of Harrison's catalogue, New Zealand Herald journalist Graham Reid says the track is \\"a much better song than it seemed at the time\\",Graham Reid, \\"George Harrison Revisited, Part One (2014): The dark horse bolting out of the gate\\", Elsewhere, 24 October 2014 (retrieved 4 December 2014). while Oregano Rathbone of Record Collector cites it as an example of how each of Harrison's Apple albums after the critically acclaimed All Things Must Pass \\"contains shivery moments of release\\".Oregano Rathbone, \\"George Harrison ‚Äì The Apple Years 1968‚Äì75\\", Record Collector, December 2014 (retrieved 4 December 2014). Writing for the website Vintage Rock, Shawn Perry views the track as one of its composer's \\"most overshadowed songs\\" and a highlight of \\"a creative and introspective album that's aged well\\".Shawn Perry, \\"George Harrison The Apple Years 1968‚Äì75 ‚Äì Boxset Review\\", vintagerock.com, October 2014 (retrieved 4 May 2015). Among Harrison biographers, Simon Leng describes \\"This Guitar\\" as a \\"harrowing song\\", with a \\"passionate and powerful\\" Harrison vocal, and draws parallels between it and Neil Young's similarly anti-journalistic \\"Ambulance Blues\\". Elliot Huntley says that, while Harrison's decision to write a follow-up to \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" was misguided, the sequel is \\"a good song in its own right, with excellent lead guitar work from the master\\". Ian Inglis writes of the \\"gulf\\" separating Harrison's 1968 composition from the 1975 song: \\"While the first was a poignant and satisfying commentary that drew attention to his newfound maturity as a songwriter, this is a petulant and rather arrogant statement in which he appears to want to put himself above criticism ... Both words and music depict a sour and troubled performer, whose resentment is all too clear.\\"Inglis, pp. 51‚Äì52. Dale Allison describes \\"This Guitar\\" as a \\"beautiful song\\" with \\"ardent lyrics\\", and groups it with Harrison compositions such as \\"Isn't It a Pity\\", \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\", \\"Blow Away\\" and \\"Sat Singing\\" ‚Äì all songs that \\"remain close to the hearts of those familiar with them\\".Allison, pp. 132, 157. Other versions Harrison's experiences as a headline performer in 1974 led to him not touring again for seventeen years,Lavezzoli, p. 196. when he undertook a short tour of Japan with Eric Clapton's band in December 1991.Leng, pp. 269‚Äì71.The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 48, 191. In November that year, during rehearsals at Bray Studios in Berkshire,Badman, p. 469. \\"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\\" was one of 35 songs that Harrison considered for the concert setlist, but he did not perform it at any of the shows.Madinger & Easter, p. 482.

The company was founded in 1929 and has its headquarters in L√∂hne, North Rhine-Westphalia. It delivers its products to over 60 countries worldwide. SieMatic is considered among the best-known German luxury brands. Since 1998, Ulrich W. Siekmann has been Managing Director of SieMatic, the third generation of his family to run the company. In 2007, the company achieved sales of ‚Ç¨130.1 million and in 2012 it had roughly 500 employees. History Headquarters in L√∂hne (2008) In the 1920s, August Siekmann established a factory to produce kitchen furniture on the site of the Cologne-Minden Railway Company. During the Second World War, large sections of the factory site were destroyed, yet the company resumed kitchen production in 1946. In 1960, SieMatic unveiled the first kitchen with integrated grip handles for a handle-free door front. From that point on, the entire company went by SieMatic as both its brand and official company name. At the beginning of the 1970s, the capacity of the original plant in L√∂hne was significantly expanded. For the first time, the company achieved sales of over 100 million Deutsche Mark and established subsidiaries in other European countries. In 1979, SieMatic entered the US market, setting up a subsidiary there. In the 1990s, SieMatic was among the first kitchen furniture manufacturers using medium-density fiberboard (MDF) for its products. In 2004, SieMatic opened a showroom center at its headquarters, the \\"August Wilhelm Siekmann Forum\\", which is still open today. The company also set up a new logistics center near the L√∂hne headquarters. Products SieMatic S1 black edition (2007) SieMatic manufactures kitchen furnishings including cabinetry, countertops, interior organization systems and accessories. One of the company's most well-known products is the S1, a handle-free kitchen introduced in 2008 that integrated lighting and multimedia systems into cabinetry, winning various awards including the Red Dot Design Award. Since then, SieMatic has also offered the S2 and S3, similar products at different price points. More recently SieMatic began categorizing kitchens by \\"style collections\\" instead of product series. As of 2016, the company style collections are divided into Classic, Pure and Urban. For several years, the wood chips and dust accumulated during production in the SieMatic factory in L√∂hne have been collected and used as an energy source to heat the company headquarters. As of 2016, SieMatic has a plant site totaling over 70,000 m¬≤ (17.3 acres).

It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. It is located in the Savage Mill Historic District. Buildings in the complex date from 1822 to 1916. Early history The mill property is part of a land grant named Ridgeley's Forest, surveyed on June 3, 1685, by Colonel Henry Ridgley, a future justice of the peace for Anne Arundel who arrived in the colonies in 1659. The property was occupied by Alexander Warfield's (1677-1745) son who transferred it to his cousin, Alexander Warfield (of John) (1704-1740). In 1750, Alexander constructed an early mill along the river at the falls and passed it along to his sons Brice Warfield and John Worthington. The mill was not run profitably and was sold to Francis Simpson (1721-1804) along with portions of \\"Warfields Range\\" along the Little Patuxent in 1760. Simpson acquired several local plantation properties and was noted in the 1790 and 1800 Anne Arundel County Census having 16-17 slaves working for him by 1800. The cotton mill Savage Mill and Bollman Bridge in the 1970s Commodore Joshua Barney had a colorful career as a sailor, merchant and privateer ranging from Philadelphia harbor to Jamaica. He acquired the land we know as Savage when it was still part of Anne Arundel county, referencing it in letters as being at \\"Elkridge\\" (The name the nearest port at Elkridge Landing). In 1809, Nathaniel F. Williams (1782-1864) married Caroline Barney, daughter of Joshua Barney, who lived at the Commodore Joshua Barney House built in 1760. The mill was started next to the Barney house in 1810 by brothers Nathanael F. Williams, Amos Adams Williams (1776-), Cumberland Dugan Williams (1781-) and George Williams (1778-). Shortly after starting the enterprise, Joshua Barney and Nathaniel Williams participated in the War of 1812, with Nathanial becoming wounded at the Battle of North Point and Barney wounded at the Battle of Bladensburg. The mill and town were named after the Kingston, Jamaican born John Savage II(1790-1831), of the Philadelphia shipping firm Savage & Dugan. Savage was also known for his association with the old United States Bank. A close family association to the founders of Savage and Dugan is evident in Cumberland Dugan Williams naming. Savage financed the Williams brothers the money to start the business and bought the mill outright in 1823 for $6,667.67. James E. P. Boulden In December 1821 the mill was chartered as the Savage Manufacturing Company. The main product was cotton duck, used for sailcloth and a wide variety of other uses. On March 26, 1824, $12,000 was loaned from the Bank of Baltimore to expand operations. The mill had established itself early on as a premier site of manufacturing product and machinery for the east coast as noted in an 1825 letter from Daniel Lammott to E.I. Du Pont stating \\"it would be the best and largest establishment in the country.\\" Most workers were women who were on lockdown throughout their shifts posing a risk of certain peril if a fire broke out. A messenger would deliver notes if communications were needed or they could speak through a small window in the locked door. By 1829 Amos Williams combined \\"Whites Contrivance\\", \\"Brothers In Partnership\\", and \\"Williams Discovery\\" to expand the mill town to 980 acres. The parcel was named \\"Conclusion\\", which was joined with Charles Alexander Warfield's \\"Wincopin Neck\\" upstream to form a dam on the Little Patuxent River, which runs adjacent to the mill property. Money was loaned to by additional land from Mrs. Dorsey. Amos managed the company at the time from an office in Baltimore on Calvert street just west of Lexington. In 1831, Mr. Hack, a machinist at the mill developed a machine for reeling and twisting silk that was taken to Washington for a patent The same year, a case of Small Pox struck at least 30 persons. In October 1832, Amos Williams moved to the mill site with a salary of $300 a year to entertain business clients. By this time the cotton mill site had a grist mill, saw mill, machine shop, foundry, blacksmith shop, wheelwright shop, brick-making facility, farm, rental houses and company store. That year, Joseph Bancroft used parts manufactured by the mill to establish a mill in Rockdale, Pennsylvania. In 1835 the post office moved from Waterloo to Savage Factory. In 1837, a furnace purchased for $8,000 operated on the mill property but managed separately by Amos A Williams, Cumberland Dugan Williams and Thomas Landsdale. After a drought in June 1836, the company decided to operate a lower cost wagon path to connect to the new B&O; railroad and a portion of the Thomas Snowden's property on the Hammond Branch was added to divert water. The same year the company provided slabbing engines, turning lathes and gear cutters to the Harpers Ferry Armory, location John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry. From 1836 to 1843, The Savage Manufacturing Company started its own currency with scrip amounts of 25 cents, 50 cents and one dollar. On June 6, 1839 Amos A. Williams resigned due to a sickness that would last until 1844, leaving control of the company to his brother Cumberland Dugan Williams. During his sickness, the company developed \\"Baldwin's Cotton, Hay and Tobacco press which was manufactured onsite for sales in the Southern states and the Rechm planing machine. Additional land was purchased by the mill on November 28, 1843, for $4,755 that included property from Mr. Lambert and William Worthington for firewood and ore for the furnace operations. In 1846, The Savage Manufacturing Company sold existing or manufactured looms and steam power engines for the Powhatan Company in Baltimore. In 1848, Amos A. Williams entered ligation against the Savage Manufacturing Company and his brothers George, Cumberland and Nathanial claiming they tried to force him into poverty from indebtedness during his illness. The mill had a good source of water power, but the river was unnavigable for delivery. Horses and mules were used to deliver the product to market. In March 1835 the Savage Railroad Company was incorporated by Amos and Cumberland Williams and other investors with $15,000 in stock to bring a rail spur to the mill off the Patuxent branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and in the 1870s a Bollman Truss Bridge was moved to the spur. This bridge survives and is the only one of its kind left. In 1859, William Henry Baldwin Jr. (1821- ) of the Talbot Jones Co. (Woodward Baldwin & Co.) took over operations as the Savage Manufacturing Company, purchasing the land and factory for $42,000. From 1861 to 1862 the mill closed due to lack of raw cotton from the Southern states during the civil war. The mill was managed by William Henry's son Carroll Baldwin from 1905 to 1918 merging with the New York-based Baldwin, Leslie and Company. In 1918 the company was renamed Leslie Evans and Company after Baldwin's death. Harry M. Leslie (1880-1945) managed the Savage Mill, the Hart Cotton Mill of Tarboro, North Carolina, Postex Cotton Mills of Post, Texas and Clinchfield Manufacturing Company of Marion, North Carolina. Workers from the factory worked 6 days a week in 10 hours shifts and were issued company scrip in various denominations that were usable in the only store in the village on Commerce street that was also owned by the company. In 1880, steam engines were installed. In 1911 The Savage Manufacturing Company Patented a process for drying paper using its cotton duck product. Notable factory workers at the mill included Horatio Gambrill of Druid Mills, David Carroll of Mt. Vernon Mills, and Baltimore mayor Samuel Hinks. In February 1928, in the lull in operations between World War I and World War II, the B&O; discontinued its Patuxent rail spur service upstream to the quarries at Guilford, Maryland, leaving Savage at the end of the line. In 1939, Savage still operated as a \\"company town\\" under less progressive standards, with the Savage Manufacturing Company stipulating that land it considered donating to the county for a school never be sold for use by an African American, another business, or sales of wine or spirits. Throughout World War II the mill produced heavy duck for canvas, hoses, refining and sails and community power from the waterwheel. The demand for canvas dropped considerably after the war, and the mill was scheduled to be shut down 1 January 1948. At time the 400 acre complex employed 372, consisted of twelve industrial buildings and 98 houses owned and rented by the mill. All though there were early records of using African American apprentices prior to the civil war, the mill remained segregated through most of its industrial history. The oldest remaining mill structure is the stone carding and spinning building, probably built between 1816 and 1823. The mill was expanded by the Baldwins before 1881, and that expansion included the brick tower with Romanesque overtones. Other buildings include the weaving shed, preparation area, paymaster's office, and several early-20th century warehouses and power plants. The Christmas village After the mill closed it was bought by Harry Heim for $450,000 who converted it into Santa Novelties, manufacturing Christmas ornaments, featuring a Christmas Display Village named \\"Santa Heim\\" (Santa's Home) which opened in December 1948. It featured live reindeer, a one ring circus, and a miniature train that carried guests to the mill from a parking lot on U.S. Route 1. A turreted castle was built at the corner of route one and Gorman road. The Carol Baldwin Hall was used for sales of Christmas products. Several picket fenced homes along the tree-lined Baltimore Avenue were demolished for the operation. Production included 65 million Christmas tree globes produced onsite with 400 workers. This business was relatively short lived. Efforts to rename the town to Santa Heim did not go through, as did the plan for a hotel and artificial lake with a waterfall. In 1950 the mill was purchased by Albert Winer and his brothers Samuel, Hyman, and Ephraim who used for warehousing by the National Store Fixture Company. Renovation In 1975, Winer unsuccessfully attempted to rezone the mill property from industrial to business while starting a restoration attempt. The initial restoration was completed by September 1981. In 1985 Albert Winer's son Jay Winer founded Savage Limited Partnership and reopened the mill as a collection of restaurants, specialty shops, and antique dealers. In 1991, The State of Maryland and Howard County loaned Savage Mill Limited Partnership $900,000. The partnership declared bankruptcy in 1994. This has been expanded over the years to encompass five of the larger buildings in the complex. In 2010, tourism numbers for the mill surpassed one million. A series of zip lines and rope obstacles were built along the mill race creating Terrapin Adventures. In 2015 the mill drew regional publicity after the owner of Rams Head was convicted for videotaping women in a bathroom. Subdivision In 2013, the Howard County Department of Planning and Zoning issued a comprehensive zoning update that included zoning changes to allow density increases for the \\"Savage remainder\\" property. The five acre plateau of woodland with steep drops to the Patuxent on two sides that was not purchased by the county as part of Savage Park. Buzzutto homes proposed a housing project called the Settlement at Savage Mill which included significant grading changes and donations of land by the parks department to the developer to maximize density, which was opposed by a referendum attempt. The 7000-person referendum attempt was suppressed by the landowners' attorney, William Erskine, who sits on the economic development agency as well as the same law firm as County Executive Ken Ulman's father.

Miyatake T≈çy≈ç; 1895‚Äì1979) was a Japanese American photographer, best known for his photographs documenting the Japanese American people and the Japanese American internment at Manzanar during World War II.

With an interest in arts ‚Äî most notably photography, which he studied under Harry K.

Press, 1998), p. 465. At the time Miyatake met his future wife, his brother was courting her. He began spending time with Hiro under the guise that he was using her as a model. His brother was crushed; it is said that he \\"died of a broken heart\\" at an early age. Before World War II, Miyatake's photography won awards including the 1926 London International Photography Exhibition as he photographed various personalities. = Manzanar = With the outbreak of American involvement in World War II following the attack on Pear Harbor, Miyatake was incarcerated at the Manzanar internment camp in the Owens Valley along with his wife and four children,\\"Toyo Miyatake\\", Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved 6 Nov. 2019. part of the internment of Japanese Americans during the war. He smuggled a camera lens into the camp and had a camera body constructed from wood, while an ally smuggled film and developing supplies to him from outside to allow him to take and develop photographs of the camp.Nancy Matsumoto, \\"Documenting Manzanar - Part 15 of 18 (Toyo Miyatake), Discover Nikkei, October 2011. Retrieved 6 Nov. 2019. Using this equipment he secretly took at photographs of the camp, working primarily in the early morning before most people were about, or at mealtimes, to avoid being seen photographing by the military police. Although he initially started his photography in secret, he approached Manzanar project director Ralph Merritt to ask to serve as official camp photographer. This would allow him to take photos to commemorate weddings and other official purposes, and to photograph Japanese volunteers who wanted photos for their families before they left for military service. Marritt agreed to this, but since at the time inmates were not allowed cameras, the proviso was made that Miyatake could set up the camera and frame the photograph, but the actual shutter release must be done by a white person. This condition was eventually lifted, and eight months after arriving at the camp, Matsumo was issued an ID card as the official concentration camp photographer, allowing him to take pictures at will, and sent for his photographic equipment from his (closed) studio in Los Angeles. He set up a studio at the camp as part of the internee-run Manzanar Consumer Cooperative. At Manzanar, Miyatake met and began a longtime collaboration with Ansel Adams, who visited and photographed the camp in 1943. After the war, they showed their photographs in a collaborative exhibit,\\"Two Views Of Manzanar, FREDERICK S. WIGHT GALLERY, U.C.L.A., Art Forum, March 1979.

Retrieved 6 November 2019. = Post-War = After the war, the family returned to Los Angeles, where their home had been entrusted to some of their white friends during the incarceration. Unlike many families who lost their homes, the Miyatakes were able to resume their life and provide shelter to a few less fortunate incarcerees and their families. In post-war Little Tokyo, many residents were unable to afford Miyatake's services and some opted instead to barter goods to have him photograph weddings and portraits. With his wife Hiro running the front office, she once negotiated his services for a Steinway piano and another time, she negotiated for a litter of poodles. After the death of his wife, Hiro, in 1971, Miyatake moved from his home on Third Street in East Los Angeles to live in neighboring Monterey Park with his daughter and her family. He remained active in the studio throughout this period. In the early morning, Miyatake could be seen walking around Monterey Highlands Elementary School for exercise. The last image he captured on film was taken at this park. The film was discovered and processed after his death. Before his death in 1979, Miyatake and Ansel Adams produced a book, Two Views of Manzanar, a compilation of their photographs during the incarceration. Miyatake's cremated remains are buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Boyle Heights; a portion of his remains are stored in the Koyasan Buddhist Temple in Little Tokyo.  Personal life  One of Miyatake's prized possessions was his white 1957 Ford Thunderbird, which now belongs to his youngest grandson, Mark Takahashi. Miyatake was easily recognizable in Little Tokyo, wearing his trademark black beret and bowtie. = Children and grandchildren = All of Miyatake's children were involved in photography and the family business. Archie, the eldest son, ran the family studio after T≈çy≈ç's death in 1979. Robert Miyatake worked in the studio and later opened his own photographic color lab in South Pasadena, California. Richard (Tabo) worked in the family studio as well and left to work in photographic production. Youngest child and only daughter, Minnie, also worked in the studio performing clerical and business-related duties and currently serves on the Board of Trustees at Koyasan Buddhist Temple, where her father's remains are stored. Miyatake's grandson continues the family business to this day. =Toyo Miyatake Studio = The Toyo Miyatake Studio moved in 1985 to San Gabriel, California, where it still operates today. The studio is now managed by grandson, Alan Miyatake.  In culture  In the TV movie Farewell to Manzanar, Pat Morita portrays Zenahiro, a character based on Miyatake.  Legacy  In 2001, Robert A. Nakamura directed the film, Toyo Miyatake: Infinite Shades of Gray, documenting the photographer's life and work.

Except for the 504-foot towerhttps://www.fccinfo.com/CMDProASRLookup.php?sASR=1036577&tabSearchType;=ASR+Search next to it, there are no nearby large structures. For these reasons, as well as its distinctive shape and large size, the tower is prominently visible from a variety of locations in the District of Columbia and suburban Maryland. The tower is owned by the District of Columbia Department of General Services, Portfolio Division. It is used for radio communication by the Washington, D.C. police and fire departments. Until 2017, it broadcast the WDCW Channel 50 television signal. The three-legged, free-standing star tower shares its design with the Star Tower in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was designed by Texas engineer Henry ‚ÄúHank‚Äù McGinnis, who worked in the Landmark or Adelphon style. It was built by the Landmark Tower Company and named for John S. Hughes, who as an Assistant D.C. Police Chief had led the department's adoption of communications technology. The tower has ten daytime strobe beacons on the tower's legs: one beacon per plus one at the top of the WDCW antenna. The beacons flash at 1.5-second intervals. It also has nighttime red warning navigation lights. The design includes an ichthys, or Jesus fish, developed from early sketches of the structure. In 1998, the National Capital Planning Commission approved a plan to use the Hughes Memorial Tower as part of a 9-1-1 service upgrade. In doing so, it noted that the tower was constructed without its prior permission and that it has caused \\"concern about the effect of the tower on the views of the major monuments and memorials in the Nation's Capital.\\" The tower has also been criticized by Ward 4 residents because the police \\"frequently have to close the streets next to this tower because of the risk[s] posed by falling ice\\" in winter.

It was designed by Tony Couch of Sydney, Australia. The flag was made official on Australia Day, 2002 when the administrator of the territory, Bill Taylor, presented the flag to the Christmas Island Shire. Design The flag of Christmas Island consists of a green and blue background, split the top left corner to the bottom right. These colours are intended to represent the land and sea respectively. The Southern Cross constellation appears in the bottom left of the flag in the same manner as it appears on the flag of Australia. In the top right, the golden bosun bird (Phaethon lepturus fulvus, one of six races of the white-tailed tropicbird) appears. It is considered to be a symbol of the Island. The last motif appears in the centre of the flag on a golden disc is the map of the island in green. The disc itself was originally only included to offset the green colour of the map, but has become linked to the mining industry. History =Creation= In 1986, the Christmas Island Assembly announced a competition to design both a flag and a coat of arms for the territory. There was a prize fund of $100, and some 69 entries were submitted. The winning submission was created by Tony Couch, a resident of Sydney but who had previously worked on Christmas Island. The new flag was announced on April 14, 1986 by the Christmas Island Assembly. =Implementation= The first attempt to make the flag official occurred in 1995 when the Minister of the Islands at the time took the view that implementation could take place on Australia Day 1996 via a formal announcement by the Administrator rather than an amendment to the Christmas Island Act 1958. Although this was agreed, the declaration never took place. Subsequently, Christmas Island official Gary Dunt revived the issue in 2001 and the flag was formally declared the official flag of Christmas Island on Australia Day 2002 (26 January), by the administrator of the territory, Bill Taylor.

In the late 1960s it was renamed after Bernard Frank, a wilderness activist and a co-founder of The Wilderness Society. The lake's boundaries are, approximately, Route 28, East Gude Drive, Avery Road, and Muncaster Mill Road. Lake Frank was created in 1966 as Lake Norbeck to aid in flood and sediment control, as well as to provide recreation. It has an earthen dam, installed in 1967, on its southern side. It was created as a sister lake to Lake Needwood. Lake Frank is owned by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M‚ÄìNCPPC). The lake's secluded location within Rock Creek Regional Park is another of its assets. Visitors to the lake must bike or walk about 1/4 of a mile from all parking lots to get to the lakeshore. The Lake Frank & Meadowside Trails surround the lake, making it a favorite hiking spot. Also, locals enjoy fishing from the shoreline, though a license is needed to do so. However, swimming, boating, and ice skating are prohibited. The main trail around Lake Frank, the Lakeside Trail, is a 3 mile long loop. Approximately 2/3 of the trail is unpaved and traverses the woods surrounding the lake. The other part of the trail is wider and paved. At the approximate half-way point of the trail, there is a creek that must be crossed. Though there are a group of rocks which form a bridge-like path across, the creek may be impassable depending on the water level.  Water Quality  In 1998, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) identified Lake Frank as \\"impaired by nutrients\\" on its list of impaired surface waters. Eutrophic conditions in the lake were described at that time, evidenced by excessive algal growth and low dissolved oxygen levels. In 2002, MDE prepared a report based on more recent monitoring data which indicated improved conditions. The 2002 report proposed that the lake be removed from the impairment listing.Maryland Department of the Environment.

Further development of the Great Transition scenarios has been carried on by the Great Transition Initiative (GTI). The GSG's underlying scenario development work was rooted in the long-range integrated scenario analysis that Tellus Institute and Stockholm Environment Institute had undertaken through the PoleStar Project and its PoleStar System. Initially conceived in 1991 as a tool for integrated sustainability planning and long- range scenario analysis, the PoleStar System was inspired by the 1987 Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future, which first put the concept of sustainable development on the international agenda. The work of the Global Scenario Group was widely adopted in high-level intergovernmental settings. The scenarios informed numerous international assessments, including the World Water Council's World Water Vision report in 1999‚Äì2000, the OECD Environmental Outlook in 2001, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's greenhouse gas emission mitigation assessment in 2001, the United Nations Environment Programme's Third GEO Report in 2002, and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment in 2005. Several of the GSG participants who actively participated in the IPCC assessments have been recognized for contributing to the 2007 award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the IPCC.Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007 Scenarios In 2002, the GSG formally summarized their scenario approach in an essay called Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead.Paul Raskin, Tariq Banuri, Gilberto Gallop√≠n, Pablo Gutman, Al Hammond, Robert Kates, and Rob Swart, Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead (Boston: Stockholm Environment Institute, 2002), http://www.greattransition.org/gt-essay. See also its sequel: Paul Raskin, Journey to Earthland: The Great Transition to Planetary Civilization. Boston: Tellus Institute, 2016, http://www.greattransition.org/publication/journey-to- earthland. The essay argues that history has entered a qualitatively new era of high global interdependence, which they refer to as the planetary phase of civilization. Some kind of global society will take shape in this century, but its form remains deeply uncertain and highly contested. Three classes of scenarios are discussed ‚Äì Conventional Worlds, Barbarization, and Great Transitions. =Conventional Worlds= Conventional Worlds scenarios envision a future which unfolds without major surprises and with essential continuity with current trends, driving forces, and dominant values. Market Forces versions rely heavily on free markets that generate sufficient and timely technological evolution to address emerging environmental and social challenges. Policy Reform versions assume instead that governments mobilize to mount a coordinated, sustained, and effective regime of policy adjustments to mitigate environmental disasters and social destabilization. =Barbarization= Barbarization scenarios depict futures in which the market and policy adjustments of Conventional Worlds are inadequate to address such problems as climate change and social polarization, leading to a devolution of civilized norms. In Fortress World variants, powerful global actors respond to impending collapse by mounting an authoritarian intervention to stem environmental degradation and social conflict. International elites retreat to protected enclaves, where they manage remaining natural resources and protect their interests. Outside these enclaves, the remainder of civilization endures poverty and degradation. Breakdown variants would ensue if the elite are unable to form a coherent, adequate response to the mounting crisis. The world descends into conflict and degradation, as institutions collapse. =The Great Transition= Great Transition scenarios go beyond the market and policy adjustments of Conventional Worlds to envision a fundamental shift in institutions and values. The growth imperative of Conventional Worlds economies give way to steady state economies, the tendency toward inequality is countered by egalitarian social policies, and human values turn toward solidarity, well-being, and ecology, rather than individualism, consumerism, and domination of nature. The potential of a Great Transition is linked to the emergence of a global citizens movement to advocate for new values to underpin global society. Eco-communalism variants are characterized by extreme localism, while the New Sustainability Paradigm alternative welcomes cosmopolitanism and global governance in a plural world. In all versions, civilization has a far smaller ecological footprint, societies are more equitable, and citizens have more leisure time to pursue fulfilling activities.

The name is found chiefly in the various- language editions of the Chronicle of the Morea. It also appears as Skodra and Skorda (Œ£Œ∫ŒøœÅŒ¥·Ω∞, Œ£Œ∫ŒøŒ¥œÅ·Ω∞), in the chronicle of Pseudo-Dorotheos of Monemvasia.. The northern portion of this area, around Akova, was also known by the Greek name Mesarea (ŒúŒµœÉŒ±œÅŒ≠Œ±, a common term in Greece for inland locations, cf. Mesaria.); in some cases, when juxtaposed with Mesarea, the term \\"Skorta\\" is limited to the southern portion, around Karytaina.. The local population was renowned for its rebellious character, and never fully submitted to the Frankish Princes of Achaea. It frequently rose up, aided by the Byzantine Greeks of the province of Mystras. As a result, two of the most powerful baronies of Achaea were set up to control the region, the Barony of Akova in the north and the Barony of Karytaina (or Skorta) in the south.. The region of Skorta rose up in rebellion ca. 1302, when Prince Philip of Savoy raised new taxes on the local Greek gentry. Taking advantage of the absence of the Principality's marshal, Nicholas III of Saint Omer, with many troops on campaign in Thessaly, and with the aid of the Byzantines of Mystras, the rebels took and burned to the ground the castles of Saint Helen and of Cr√®vecoeur, and laid siege to the castle of Beaufort. When the Prince with the levies from his feudatories moved against the Greeks, however, the latter chose to withdraw, and Frankish rule was swiftly re-established over the region.

In 1384 he was deputy to Sir Philip Courtenay, the then Lieutenant of Ireland, who was the nephew of the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Courtenay. The two men for a time were united in opposition to Robert Wikeford, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, who resented the Butler dynasty's power and influence. Butler's title was Governor of Ireland. A rift occurred between them over the disagreement between the Archbishop of Canterbury and Richard II with Butler taking the side of the latter. Insurrection followed which prompted Richard II to an expedition under the banner of his close friend Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland to quell it. This enterprise was led by Sir John Stanley who was accompanied by Bishop Alexander de Balscot of Meath and Sir Robert Crull.Rolls of 9 Richard II- Part I Membrane 1, cont.

Here \\"...\\" represents any beginning to the auction. The forcing pass (bold) necessarily occurs directly over an opposing bid, double, or redouble (act). After a pass over a pass, the auction might end before partner's turn. In other words, the partnership is committed to act somehow rather than to end the auction now; that is a precondition. The first, direct, \\"forcing pass\\" refers to partner the choice how to act. There is no commitment to accept partner's choice. Indeed, a forcing pass ensures that the auction will return to the one who issues it, so it may be interpreted as the first half of a two-step action by that player. Normally double is natural where pass is forcing. That is, double suggests the current denomination and strain, doubled, as a final contract. \\"Forcing pass\\" is also a synonym for strong pass, a conventional pass in first or second position that shows a strong hand and is \\"a form of opening bid\\" in effect. Strong pass systems are barred from many competitive events.http://web2.acbl.org/documentLibrary/about/CONVENTIONCHARTS2_2020.pdf  When is pass forcing?  Here \\"...

The opponents may be obliged to keep the bidding open themselves because their action is forcing. Then the forcing pass is a moot point and the concept may be considered inapplicable. When their action is not forcing, on the other hand, partnership understanding whether pass is forcing may be vital. Partners should recognize forcing pass situations. =Low-level forcing pass= One family of forcing pass occurs when the partnership auction is already forcing to a particular level and the opponents bid below that level. :1 (1) 2 (2) Pass Commonly 2 is forcing to 2NT. Then pass over opposing 2 is forcing. Here 2 is natural but the same holds over a conventional call that is forcing. If the convention is a bid forcing only to the next step, such as a Jacoby transfer, then pass is forcing only over a double. ... when one opponent doubles or redoubles a conventional takeout and thereby suggests they may defend our chosen strain doubled for penalty. :(1) 2 (Dbl) Pass Commonly 2 is artificial for takeout, a Michaels cuebid showing both major suits, and the opposing double suggests that they double the chosen major. Then pass is forcing; it refers the choice of major suit back to the one who bid 2. ... for the partnership that doubles or redoubles to suggest playing for penalty. :1 (Dbl) Rdbl (2) Pass :1 (Dbl) Rdbl (Pass) Pass (2) Pass Double is for takeout and redouble shows a strong hand, suggesting that we double their chosen strain. When either opponent does name a strain (here diamonds), a direct pass is forcing. Commonly the forcing pass declines to recommend play for penalty (double would be natural) and waits to see whether partner will double (natural). =High-level forcing pass= ... when it appears that an opposing bid is a sacrifice. :1 (2) 3 (5) Pass Commonly 3 is a strong raise of hearts and 5 seems to be an advance sacrifice. Then a direct pass is forcing. It declines to recommend playing 5 doubled and thereby suggests bidding at least 5. What is the meaning of a forcing pass followed by 5 if partner does double? :1 (2) 3 (5) Pass (Pass) Dbl (Pass) 5 At least following trump suit agreement, as in this case (hearts), there is a common conventional distinction.

A Biographical Dictionary of Jersey, p 351-2. London: Staples Press A self-portrait by Lander On leaving school, he was sent to become a watchmaker at the age of fifteen, but spent so much time drawing that he was taken away and allowed to paint. On reaching the age of seventeen and having sold some of his pictures, he went to London to study in an art school. Although he remained there a year, he hated the school. He was invited to breakfast with Sir John Everett Millais, a fellow Jerseyman, who advised him to continue his artistic career and to go to Paris. In Paris he studied at the Acad√©mie Julian under William-Adolphe Bouguereau and Fleury.Lander, J. St H. (1939). John St Helier Lander, painter of Royal portraits, by Himself. The Islander Vol 1, Issue 9, pages 4‚Äì5 Plaque in Belmont Road, Saint Helier, Jersey After a year in Paris he returned to London to enter the Royal Academy Schools where he stayed for three years, before returning to Jersey and setting up a studio, taking Millais and Walter William Ouless, another distinguished fellow Jerseyman, as ideals in the art of portrait painting. He taught privately at the Jersey Ladies' College (now Jersey College for Girls) and the Guernsey Ladies' College. He undertook an ambitious group portrait of the Assize d'H√©ritage (known as \\"The Sitting\\") which took him four years to complete. In 1897, it was purchased for ¬£400 by Julia Westaway, of the Westaway Trust, and presented to the Royal Court in Jersey where it now hangs.Le Brocq, P. (1998). The Royal Court and States Building. Publisher unknown London He was greatly encouraged by the Lieutenant-Governor of Jersey at the time, Major General Henry Richard Abadie. When the General left Jersey, Lander followed him to London, where Abadie introduced him to society clients. Abadie was a regular visitor to Lander's studio. Between Abadie and Colonel Sir Malcolm Fox, Lander made the acquaintance of all the leading British generals before the First World War. The wartime demand for portraits provided Lander with steady work and brought his name before a wider public. In 1923 he received a silver medal at the Paris Salon and painted his first important Royal portrait. He had been commissioned to symbolize the \\"Youth of England\\" through the Prince of Wales. Lander chose to portray the Prince dressed in polo kit, and the resulting picture was acclaimed, being awarded a medal at the Paris Salon. The King and Queen commanded that it be sent to Buckingham Palace for private viewing and consequently commissioned a copy for the Palace. The Queen then commissioned a portrait of the Duke of Kent in tennis kit. T.B. Davis commissioned a portrait of King George V of the United Kingdom for Victoria College, Jersey with a copy for the Engineers' College, Durban. Further copies were endowed for Canada House, Australia House and New Zealand House. Lander took pride in the fact that five of these portraits of the King had been \\"unveiled by Royal Princes, an honour no portrait painter has ever had before\\".

It exploits low intensity and pulsed mechanical waves in order to induce regenerative and anti-inflammatory effects on biological tissues, such as bone, cartilage, and tendon. Even if the real mechanism underlying its effectiveness has not been understood yet, it is plausible that the treatment relies on non-thermal phenomena, such as microbubbles and microjets induced by cavitation, acoustic streaming, and mechanical stimulation.  Technique LIPUS uses generally 1.5 MHz frequency pulses, with a pulse width of 200 Œºs, repeated at 1 kHz, at a spatial average and temporal average intensity of 30 mW/cm2. Medical uses Starting around the 1950s this technology was being used as a form of physical therapy for ailments such as tendinitis. As of 2009 research for the use of LIPUS to treat soft tissue injuries were in the early stages. As of 2012 it was being studied for dental problems. Low intensity pulsed ultrasound has been proposed as a therapy to support bone healing after fractures, osteomies, or delayed healing. A 2017 review, however, found no trustworthy evidence for the use of low intensity pulsed ultrasound for bone healing. An associated guideline issued a strong recommendation against its use in bone healing. Evidence as of 2014 was insufficient to justify its use to prevent non healing of bone fractures. Tentative evidence supports better healing with the use of the system in long bones that have not healed after three months. Some reviews suggested inconclusive evidence of benefit. One industry supported meta- analysis suggested it as a potential alternative to surgery for established nonunions. Most studies suggesting benefit were funded by manufacturers of ultrasound devices. In 2018, a study published in the journal Brain Stimulation, reported that experiments on mice showed that whole-brain LIPUS therapy markedly improved cognitive dysfunctions without serious side effects by enhancing specific cells related to dementia's pathology. Clinical trials are underway. In vitro experiments have confirmed the LIPUS capability to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation as well as the opening of cell membrane channels.

The sport is most popular in the United Kingdom and Spain, though there are participants around the globe. Modern trials motorcycles are distinctive in that they have evolved to become extremely lightweight, lack seating (they are designed to be ridden standing up) and have suspension travel that is short, relative to a motocross or enduro motorcycle. Motorcycle trials is often utilized by competitors in other motorcycle sports (such as motocross or road racers) as a way to cross-train, as trials requires fine throttle, balance, and machine control. Characteristics The event is split into sections where a competitor rides through an obstacle course while attempting to avoid touching the ground with the feet. The obstacles in the course may be of natural or constructed elements. In all sections, regardless of content, the designated route is carefully contrived to test the skill of the rider. In many local observed trials events, the sections are divided into separate courses to accommodate the different skill level of riders, who compete in skill-rated classes. In every section, the competitor is scored by an observer (hence the sport's name) who counts how many times the competitor touches the ground with the foot (or any other part of the body). Each time a competitor touches the ground with a foot (commonly called \\"dabs\\" or \\"prods\\"), the penalty is one point. Beta Rev 3 The possible scores in each section consist of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 5. If a competitor makes their way through the section without touching the ground with a foot, they earn a score of 0 (which is called \\"cleaning the section\\"). If they touch the ground once, they receive a score of 1. If they touch down twice, they receive a score of 2. If they touch the ground three or more times, they earn a score of 3--as long as they complete the section without stalling the motor, dismounting, going out of bounds, or going backward. If the competitor fails to complete the section a score of 5 (sometimes colourfully called \\"a fiasco\\") is earned. The winner is the competitor with the fewest points at the end of the event. Some events are also timed with penalty points assessed to late riders. There is a world indoor and outdoor championship, as well as indoor and outdoor national team \\"world cups\\" (Trial des Nations). British competitor Dougie Lampkin is notable for winning seven world outdoor titles in the 1990s and 2000s, the same number that Spanish competitor Jordi Tarr√©s won in the 1980s and 1990s. Previous observed trials greats include Northern Ireland's Sammy Miller (1960s), Finland's Yrj√∂ Vesterinen (1970s) and Belgium's Eddy Lejeune (1980s). The current outdoor world champion is Antoni Bou from Spain who is also the current indoor champion. In addition to the world championship events, there are other major events, such as the Scottish Six Days Trial (SSDT) and the Scott Trial. Major current manufacturers of trials bikes are Gas Gas, Beta, Sherco, Montesa Honda, Scorpa, TRS and Vertigo. In the past there have been many manufacturers, from countries such as Spain, Japan, Britain and Italy. Classic classes exist for vintage bikes. Classes include pre-1965 or pre-1967 motorcycles (typically British), as well as newer vintage events for observed trials motorcycles with two rear shock absorbers. In most cases, twin-shock motorcycles were manufactured between 1967 and 1985 and are typically Japanese or Spanish. A recent addition has been a class for air-cooled monoshock bikes, this covers machines up to around 1990. A competition event is called an \\"observed trial\\" or \\"trial\\" (not plural), unless referred to as an \\"observed trials event\\". A newer name for the sport, MotoTrial, is used by some organizations. However, it was recently dropped by the Federation Internationale de Motocyclisme as a name for its observed trials competitions. Outdoor events are called Trial, while FIM indoor events are called X-Trial. =Sidecar trials= A sidecar trials bike competing in an observed section As well as the traditional solo motorcycle trials, there is a form of the sport on 3 wheels known as Sidecar Trials consisting of a driver and a passenger. The competition is run in the same way as a standard motorcycle trial with the only exception being additional ways to be given a score of 5. This involves the passenger, who will earn the competitor a 5 if any part of the passenger's body touches any terrain. The role of the passenger is to balance the sidecar and prevent the sidecar wheel from lifting which would cause the driver to restablise the outfit by using his foot (incurring a score of 1). Sidecar Trials is predominantly British, however there are events run in Europe and Australia. The British Championship is the highest level of competition, held over 10 rounds with 3 difficulty levels; Clubman, Intermediate & Expert, with the Expert class championship winner being named British Sidecar Trials Champion. =Long distance trials= Long distance trials competition incorporates a carefully planned out route for the competitors to follow and make stops at various locations incorporating places throughout many different countries, rather than one venue. This takes place not only on the main roads but also steep, rough and loose surfaced hills and lanes. Points are given to the competitor for putting his foot down on the ground or falling off. These trials can be expected to be completed within certain timescales and can mean not arriving at a particular section and or destination prior to an allocated time. Truck trials in Austria.

His early background was in gymnastics while his later training included three years with Merce Cunningham and a year with Jos√© Lim√≥n. As a founding member of the Judson Dance Theater, he performed works by Yvonne Rainer and Trisha Brown. He was a founding member of the experimental group Grand Union and in 1972 named and began to develop the dance form known as Contact Improvisation, a form of dance that utilizes the physical laws of friction, momentum, gravity, and inertia to explore the relationship between dancers. Paxton believed that even an untrained dancer could contribute to the dance form, and so began his great interest in pedestrian movement. After working with Cunningham and developing chance choreography, defined as any movement being his generation whose approach has influenced choreography globally. He attempts to remain reclusive, except when performing, teaching and choreographing internationally.  Contact improvisation  Paxton was influenced by the experimental arts and performance scene in New York in the 1960s and 1970s, and he was interested in how the body could create a physical playground. Contact improvisation developed out of an exploration of the human body and under the supervision of Paxton. Its roots trace back to 1972. Contact improvisation, usually done in duets, pulls elements from martial arts, social dance, sports, and child‚Äôs play.Sally Banes,Terpsichore in Sneakers: Post-Modern Dance(Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1979),56. Upon entering a contact improv structure, two bodies must come together to create a point of contact (i.e., back to wrist, shoulder to thigh, head to foot, back to back, the options are endless), give weight equally to each other, and then create a movement dialog that can last for an undetermined amount of time, as long as both participants are fully engaged. Contact improvisation can be done by any person because the emergence of a movement vocabulary depends on a specific touch and the initiation of weight exchange with another person. Paxton in the late 1970s focused on teaching, performing, and writing about contact improvisation around the country and in Europe.Sally Banes, Terpsichore, 56. Contact improvisation went on to be taught around the world by people like Nancy Stark Smith, who worked closely with Paxton, and by others who had been exposed to it by different dancers, choreographers, teachers, and contact improvisers.  Approach to movement  Paxton believed that even an untrained dancer could contribute to his experimental dance form. From his work with Merce Cunningham and Jos√© Lim√≥n, and later his contribution to the formation of the Judson Dance Theater and Grand Union, Paxton was fascinated with the exploration of the human body. His approach to a movement vocabulary included the pedestrian world around him. Paxton describes the body as a physical machine that can be expressive by nature and the culture around it.Nancy Reynolds and Malcolm McCormick, No Fixed Points: Dance in the Twentieth Century (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2003, 409. With the emergence of his first dance Proxy (1961) activities in this piece such as walking, sitting, and eating would preoccupy Paxton‚Äôs approach to movement for some time. Paxton was known for eliminating any outside influences that would prevent the piece from just being accepted how it was.Nancy Reynolds and Malcolm McCormick, No Fixed Points,408. He composed a range of non-dance movement vocabulary that seemed to give him a relaxed but authoritative state of being in performance.Nancy Reynolds and Malcolm McCormick, No Fixed Points, 408. Paxton minimized the differences between the audience and the performer. In turn his movement vocabulary became fragments of ‚Äòeveryday‚Äô movement mechanics and this held a world of possibilities for individual potential. Another piece that showed his fascination with the pedestrian world was Satisfyin‚Äô Lover (1967). This dance was for a group of thirty-four to eighty- four people and it utilized walking, standing, or sitting according to the score.Sally Banes, Terpsichore, 71.  Approach to the Body  Paxton not only utilized the architecture of the human body but he used objects to emphasize how the body could manipulate itself around different objects.Sally Banes, Terpsichore, 61. He was interested in texture, shape, size, and even how the use of animals influenced or changed his dance vocabulary. This is apparent in such pieces as Jag Ville Gorna Telefonera (1964). In this piece he used three chickens, a full-sized overstuffed chair made of cake and yellow frosting, and clothes with zippers in the seams that could be taken off and put back together in an assortment of ways. Paxton also challenged the concept of sex and sexuality in dance.Sally Banes, Terpsichore, 64. Not only was Paxton a revolutionary to the changing world of dance around him but his experimentation with movement and the structure of the human body crafted a different version of what it was to be a dancer. He changed and challenged the aspects of traditional modern dance. Today dancers, performers, choreographers, and teachers from around the world have incorporated some form of his teachings of Contact Improvisation into their studies.  Awards In 1980, Paxton received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.http://www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/recipients/steve-paxton Paxton received a 1994 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award, and in http://www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/recipients/steve- paxton 1995 John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowshiphttp://www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/grant_recipients/stevepaxton.html In 2014 Paxton was awarded the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement in Dance at the Venice Biennale.http://www.labiennale.org/en/dance/9th- festival/docs/paxton.html In 1987 and 1995 Paxton won New York Dance and Performance \\"Bessie\\" awards,http://www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/recipients/steve-paxton and in 2015 Paxton was awarded the Bessie for lifetime achievement.

At the lowest (ground) level, the original Richmond and York River Railroad was extended after the American Civil War to connect with the Richmond and Danville Railroad, later part of the Southern Railway System, currently part of Norfolk Southern. The line runs east to West Point, Virginia. The middle level was the main line of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, now part of CSX Transportation known as the \\"S\\" line, just south of Main Street Station. It is planned to become part of the Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor. At the top level is the Peninsula Subdivision Trestle, a viaduct parallel to the north bank of the James River built by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in 1901 to link the former Richmond and Allegheny Railroad with C&O;'s Peninsula Subdivision to Newport News and export coal piers. The viaduct, now owned by CSX Transportation, provided an alternate path to the notoriously unstable Church Hill Tunnel which buried a work train with fatalities on October 2, 1925. A locomotive and ten flat cars remain entombed with at least one rail worker, killing several others whose bodies were eventually recovered. The triple crossing has been a Richmond attraction for railfans for over 100 years, although the number of photographic angles decreased in the 1990s due to a new flood wall.

Frank Baum. Much of the original music was by Paul Tietjens and has been mostly forgotten, although it was still well- remembered and in discussion at MGM in 1939 when the classic film version of the story was made.Fricke, Stillman, Scarfone. The Wizard of Oz: The 50th Anniversary Pictorial History Although Baum is the credited bookwriter, Glen MacDonough was hired on as jokewriter after Baum had finished the script. The show premiered at the Chicago Grand Opera House on June 16, 1902 and later moved to the Majestic Theatre on Broadway on January 21, 1903, where it ran for 293 performances until December 31, 1904, followed by traveling tours of the original cast. It starred Anna Laughlin as Dorothy Gale, Fred Stone as the Scarecrow, and David C. Montgomery as the Tin Woodman (who is called Niccolo Chopper in the musical; he had no name in the original book, but would be called Nick Chopper in the sequels). Arthur Hill played the Cowardly Lion, but in this version his role was reduced to a bit part. The Wicked Witch of the West is mentioned but does not appear in this version, and Toto is replaced by a cow named Imogene. An element from the show ‚Äì the snowfall caused by the Good Witch of the North, which defeats the spell of the poppies that had put Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion to sleep ‚Äì was later used in the classic 1939 movie. Other new characters in the piece are King Pastoria II and his girlfriend, Trixie Tryfle (a waitress), Cynthia Cynch (a lady lunatic), Sir Dashemoff Daily (the poet laureate), Sir Wiley Gyle, and General Riskitt. Dorothy Gale's surname was introduced in this version. It was not mentioned in the original novel, though it is mentioned in Ozma of Oz (1907). The main plot of the show, as recounted in newspapers of the time, is Pastoria's attempts to regain the throne from the Wizard of Oz. The original protagonists' search for the Wizard puts them on the wrong side of the law. Plot Cover of production announcement showing an 'Inland Gnome', drawn by W.W. Denslow in 1894 =Act One: The Storm= A young girl named Dorothy Gale lives on the great Kansas prairie with her Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and cow, Imogene. One day, while she is playing with her pet cow, Imogene, a fierce whirlwind appears. Dorothy and Imogene take shelter in the farmhouse, which is carried far away into the clouds. Meanwhile, in the hamlet of Center Munch, the little Munchkins dance around their maypole, not noticing that Dorothy's house has fallen to Earth and killed the Wicked Witch of the East. Dorothy opens the front door and marvels at the strange Land of Oz. The Good Witch of the North awards her with a magic ring that grants her three wishes and can summon Glinda the Good Witch of the South at any time. The Good Witch then waves her wand and a pair of beautiful shoes appear on Dorothy's feet. She tells Dorothy that if she wants to get home, she must ask the Wizard of Oz to help her. After a while everyone exits, and Dorothy is left alone with a Scarecrow hung on a pole. She wishes she had someone to talk to, and he comes to life. He gets down from the pole and complains that he has no brain. Dorothy suggests that he join her on the road to the Emerald City, and he sings \\"Alas for the Man Without Brains.\\" They come upon the Tin Woodman, who has rusted playing his piccolo. As it turns out, his real name is Niccolo Chopper. He explains that the Wicked Witch of the West took his heart, so he cannot love his girlfriend, Cynthia. He joins them in the hope of receiving a heart from the Wizard, so that he can return to Cynthia. =Act Two: The Emerald City= The Keeper of the Gates patrols outside the Emerald City. Sir Wiley Gyle enters, a mad old inventor who has scorned magic since his mother died. He is sent to prison for murdering his wife. The travelers enter the Emerald City. The Wizard gives the Scarecrow a brain and the Tin Woodman a heart. He declares this the greatest of all his achievements and calls for a celebration. The Ball of All Nations is thrown, in which up to twelve songs are sung by various characters. The Wizard performs a basket trick in which King Pastoria is the mark. In the middle of it Pastoria claims his right to the throne and overthrows the Wizard. A great commotion breaks out, with the Wizard escaping in a hot air balloon. Dorothy, still longing to get home, sets off with her companions to the castle of Glinda, the Good Witch of the South. =Act Three: Glinda's Palace= Dorothy and her friends arrive at Glinda's palace and are welcomed. There are great celebrations, with Glinda promising to send Dorothy home. The whole cast rushes out from the wings and sings the finale. Conception and script Arthur Hill as the Lion and Anna Laughlin as Dorothy L. Frank Baum decided to collaborate with his friend, composer Paul Tietjens, and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz illustrator W. W. Denslow as set and costume designer, to bring the book to the stage. They completed a script, score and designs in 1901, hewing fairly close to the novel.The script was to be an appendix to Frank Joslyn Baum's biography of his father, To Please a Child, but it was not published due to copyright concerns. They submitted the package to the manager of the Chicago Grand Opera House, Fred R. Hamlin, who liked it and approached Julian Mitchell to be director. Mitchell did not like the script, criticizing its lack of spectacle, calling it too subdued and small- scale. However, he sent a wire to Hamlin with the message \\"Can see possibilities for extravaganza\\". When Mitchell accepted the project, he brought in new songwriters, cutting some of the original Tietjens numbers. He rewrote the script, together with Glen MacDonough, introducing new characters and incidents, reducing the Cowardly Lion's role, deleting the appearance of the Wicked Witch of the West entirely, and substituting a cow for Toto as Dorothy's companion. Baum was anxious about this, but went along. He hoped Mitchell's experience in directing, as well as the casting of comedy team Fred Stone and David C. Montgomery as the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman, would make the show a hit. It turned out to be a roaring success, with 293 performances. Production and early revivals In rewriting Baum's 1901 script, Mitchell hired MacDonough to add topical humor. Baum described MacDonough as a New York joke writer in a letter to The Chicago Record-Herald, responding to criticism that the show \\"teemed with wild and woolly western puns and forced gags\\".Baum, L. Frank. \\"Music and the Drama\\", Letter to the editor, The Chicago Record- Herald, February 3, 1903 In a letter to The Chicago Tribune published June 26, 1904, Baum decried rumors that he was \\"heartbroken and ashamed\\" with the final product of the musical: \\"I acknowledge that I was unwise enough to express myself as dissatisfied with the handling of my play on its first production ... few authors of successful books are ever fully satisfied with the dramatization of their work. They discern great gaps in the original story that are probably never noticed by playgoers.\\" He admitted to protesting several innovations, but ultimately concluded: \\"The people will have what pleases them, and not what the author happens to favor, and I believe that one of the reasons why Julian Mitchell is regarded as a great producer is that he faithfully tries to serve the great mass of playgoers ‚Äì and usually succeeds.\\"\\"Mr. Baum to the Public\\", The Chicago Tribune, June 26, 1904 Fred Stone as the Scarecrow and David C. Montgomery as the Tin Woodman (1902) Most of the original songs were written by Paul Tietjens on Baum's lyrics, except for three: \\"The Guardian of the Gate\\" (although it was attributed to Tietjens), which was cut after only a few performances, \\"The Different Ways of Making Love\\" (wooing) and \\"It Happens Every Day\\" were composed by Nathaniel D. Mann. Mann later wrote the score for Baum's 1908 film/theatrical presentation, The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays. Most of Baum's songs related to the story in some way, as in operetta, but as performed, the play was more like vaudeville, and new songs by other songwriters were frequently substituted. In fact, the first song interpolated into the musical was \\"The Traveler and the Pie\\", a major number for the Scarecrow. Baum and Tietjens had written it for a play called The Octopus; or the Title Trust, which was never produced and possibly never completed. The song stayed in the show. James O'Dea and Edward Hutchinson wrote one of the show's most celebrated songs, \\"Sammy\\", in which Tryxie Tryfle sings of a lost love before King Pastoria, though the only surviving recording of the piece was sung by a man (Harry Macdonough). The witches are largely absent in this version; The Good Witch of the North appears, named Locasta, and The Wicked Witch of the East is a special effect. Toto, Dorothy's dog, was replaced by a cow named Imogene. The Wicked Witch of the West does not appear, and Glinda the Good Witch of the South, who had appeared only in Act Three, was written out by Mitchell in 1903. His re-write of that act was set in the Borderland that divides Oz and Glinda's Domain, as Dorothy and her friends try to escape Pastoria. New characters include King Pastoria II, Oz's true king working as a Kansas motorman and his girlfriend, Trixie Tryfle, a waitress. There is also Cynthia Cynch, the Lady Lunatic, a prototype for Nimmie Amee, Nick (Niccolo) Chopper's girlfriend. Niccolo Chopper is renowned for his ability on the piccolo, the subject of one of her songs, and he is shown playing a piccolo in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the first Oz film made without Baum's input, which was highly influenced by the popular play. The Wizard was presented as various ethnic stock character stereotypes, depending upon who played him. He was assisted by Sir Wiley Gyle and General Riskitt. David L. Greene and Dick Martin erroneously captioned a picture of General Riskitt as \\"Sir Wiley Gyle\\" in The Oz Scrapbook, and Donald Abbott carried this mistake over into his illustrations for How the Wizard Saved Oz. The animals in the play, including the Cowardly Lion, did not speak, based on pantomime tradition. Although the lion costume was realistic, far more so than Bert Lahr's in the MGM film, his main purpose was a bit of comic relief and scaring off the villains on occasion. His quest for courage is completely omitted, much as the other characters' quests are deemphasized in favor of various comic routines. Ultimately, though, their desire to seek the Wizard's aid gets them caught on the wrong side of the revolution, jailed and ultimately scheduled for execution. In a deus ex machina, another tornado arrives to sweep Dorothy home from the chopping block. Many new plot twists are virtually pointless. In addition to a kiss of protection, Dorothy gets three wishes, one of which is wasted on a triviality. The second is used to bring the Scarecrow to life, and the third is used so she can learn the song Sir Dashemoff Daily (a trouser role) has written to his girlfriend, Carrie Barry. This song was written by Baum and Tietjens, but some programs credited the song to Glen MacDonough and A. Baldwin Sloane to make their connection to the play look greater. Probably the biggest influence on the 1939 MGM film, aside from making the story into a musical (but not using the score created for the stage version), is the field of poppies sequence that ended Act I. In the novel, Baum imaginatively has a legion of field mice pull a cart with the Cowardly Lion out of the poppy field. This was deemed unfeasible (though the stage version of The Wiz created a variation, with the mice as anthropomorphic vice cops), and Baum, though he included it in the 1901 script, replaced the scene with that of the Snow Queen creating a storm that destroys the poppies, much as Glinda does in the 1939 movie. This concluded Act I with an elaborate dance known as \\"Winter Jubilation\\", which James Patrick Doyle plays on synthesizers on the album, Before the Rainbow: The Original Music of Oz. Cast of the production at East Texas State Normal College in 1921 Because there were no cast albums in those days, theatre productions, including this production, often exceeded four hours in length because of multiple demands for encores, since many of the attendees knew they would never get to attend again. The most popular songs were often sung multiple times and this was often used to gauge whether a song should be retained or dropped. Two popular routines that were worked in include a sailing routine and a football routine, the latter parodying the level of violence in the sport, which had recently been lessened due to new regulations. The original cast included Anna Laughlin as Dorothy Gale, Fred Stone as the Scarecrow, David C. Montgomery as Nick Chopper (the Tin Man), Helen Byron as Cynthia Cynch, Bessie Wynn as Sir Dashemoff Daily, Gilbert Clayton as King Pastoria II, Bobby Gaylor as Oz, Arthur Hill as the Cowardly Lion, Grace Kimball as Tryxie Tryffle, and Edwin J. Stone as Imogene the cow. The second theatre to house the production was the New York Theatre. It went on the road playing as far away as the Opera House in Hot Springs National Park, Arkansas in 1904. By 1905, the New York production had been moved to the Academy of Music at 14th and Irving Place. Montgomery and Stone remained in the cast, but Dorothy was now played by Mona Desmond.program dated November 13, 1905. Marion Stanley took over the role of Trixie Tryfle, George B. Field played Sir Wiley Gyle, and Charles E. Mitchell became the Wizard. The Snow Queen was played by Bert Dean en travesti. The musical was revived as late as 1934, with Charles H. Pinkham in the role of the Scarecrow. Reception The New York Times critic described the show as \\"the Darling of Mr. Belasco's Gods\\".\\"The Wizard of Oz: A Warm Welcome at the North Pole of Broadway; Brilliant Scenic Effects and Good Comic Acting by Anna Laughlin, Fred A. Stone, and D. C. Montgomery\\", the New York Times, published January 21, 1903 Leone Langdon-Key loved the scenery, but found Baum's script commonplace, commenting that many lines start with, \\"Well, wouldn't that...\\" and deplored Tietjens's \\"fondness for a lack of contrast and rhythms. She also claims that the story of Pastoria trying to regain the lost throne from the Wizard was \\"as readers of the story remember\\".Langdon-Key, Leone. \\"Wizard of Oz Is a Flare of Color.\\" Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich of Russia gained considerable notoriety by drinking champagne from the satin slipper of one of the chorus girls during a 1902 trip to Chicago.Obituary, New York Herald- Tribune, November 1943. Sequel The success of the play led Baum to write The Marvelous Land of Oz after four years of demand for a sequel to the novel. He dedicated the book to Montgomery and Stone, and made the roles of the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman prominent, with the roles of Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion reduced to a reminiscence. After the team balked at leaving Wizard for a sequel, Baum wrote the stage musical, The Woggle-Bug, eliminating the Tin Woodman, replacing the Scarecrow with Regent Sir Richard Spud, replacing Glinda with Maetta from The Magical Monarch of Mo and renaming the Emerald City the \\"City of Jewels,\\" though Oz is mentioned several times. The first appearance of the title character was moved from halfway through the novel to the opening scene, and his mentor, Professor Knowitall, name shortened to Professor Knowitt, was raised to the level of romantic lead with a girlfriend named Prissy Pring, a Captain in General Jinjur's Army of Revolt. Jack Pumpkinhead and The Woggle-Bug became a comic team analogous to the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman. The play was performed at the Garrick Theater in Chicago and opened to reviews panning Baum's script and praising the score by Frederic Chapin. No songs were interpolated (although two were derived from an earlier source and erroneously credited to Baum), but the general consensus was that the play was a cash-in or rip-off of The Wizard of Oz rather than a sequel. Post-World War II revivals The musical was performed in a concert version in New York City in May 1982 by the New Amsterdam Theatre Company. It was revived in Tarpon Springs, Florida by the New Century Opera Company in 1998 and 2006, and the company recorded the Baum/Tietjens music on CD with piano accompaniment. Hungry Tiger Press published a two-CD set of vintage recordings related to the musical in 2003. The Canton Comic Opera Company, a community theatre company in Canton, Ohio, performed a \\"restored\\" version in 2010. They believe that their production was the first in over 80 years with full orchestra.\\"The Wizard of Oz\\", Canton Comic Opera Company, 2010. Retrieved July 26, 2013 Music Some of the music was known even beyond the United States. During the Baums' 1907 stay at the Shepherd's Hotel in Cairo, Egypt, a Hungarian Gypsy Band played songs from the musical in their honor. ;by Paul Tietjens *Prelude *Life in Kansas *Cyclone *Transformation *Maypole Dance *Death of the Wicked Witch *Locasta's Entrance *Invocation & Death of the Poppies *Transformation *Winter Jubilation *Hayfoot, Strawfoot *Phantom Patrol *Waltz & Grand March *Lanciers *Schottische ;by L.

Today in ruins, it is an example of typical medieval Serbian architecture. Historians believe it was built in the second half of the 14th century to control movement along nearby roads, and the town of U≈æice. Stari Grad was declared Protected Monument of Culture in 1983, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia. Though in ruins, the fortress is considered a symbol of U≈æice.  Location  The fortress is located on top of the tall, steep rocky hill which sharply declines into the ƒêetinja river. The river meanders around the rock, surrounding the fortress from three sides and preventing the access. The fortress actually sits on a cliff, and elevates above the final section of the deep canyon-like gorge of the ƒêetinja. It is situated on the river's left bank.  History  = Prehistory = The area was inhabited for millennia. Remains of prehistoric settlements are found in the ƒêetinja gorge and around it. There are two major location. The Staparska Gradina, near the Stapari village was thoroughly explored in the late 1950s when the three levels of human habitation were discovered. The lowest and oldest are dated into the Neolithic. The middle level corresponds to the Vinƒça-Ploƒçnik culture and the third one belongs to the Bronze Age. The dugouts were discovered in the oldest levels, but also the above-ground dwelling objects from the later periods. Another one is the Rimsko groblje (\\"Roman cemetery\\"). It hasn't been explored much, but the remnants of the large, above-ground and regularly shaped stone plates were discovered. In 2015 the local population built a public drinking fountain at the site. = Medieval = Fort legend The fortress was built in the second half of the 14th century by the local Vojinoviƒá noble family, which ruled the vast areas from Rudnik, over Polimlje, Podrinje, east Herzegovina with Trebinje, to Konavle and Draƒçevica, neighboring the Republic of Dubrovnik. It was built both as the ruling seat and to protect U≈æice itself and the caravan road which connected the Morava Valley with Bosnia, Hum, Adriatic coast and Dubrovnik, via the valley of the ƒêetinja river. The citadel was probably built during the rule of Nikola Altomanoviƒá. It had the stone tower, while the rest of the fortified complex was most likely wooden. Historically, the most important event in the history of the fortress happened in November 1373. United forces of Altomanoviƒá's neighbors, prince Lazar of Serbia, on the east, and king Tvrtko I of Bosnia, on the west, attacked him. Their coalition was supported by the Hungarian units sent by king Louis I of Hungary and headed by the ban of Maƒçva, Nicholas I Garai.Fine (The Late Medieval Balkans ‚Äì 1994), p. 385. During the short siege of the fortress, the coalition used cannons and siege engines which forced Altomanoviƒá to surrender. Nobleman Stefan Musiƒá, with silent approval from his commander and maternal uncle Lazar, blinded Altomanoviƒá. After the battle, Lazar and Tvrtko divided Altomanoviƒá's lands. The fortress remained Serbian until 1459 when it was conquered by the Ottomans, though it was rarely mentioned in this period. The Ottomans reconstructed the fortress, also expanding it. = Modern = A detailed account on the fort was left by the Ottoman traveler Evliya √áelebi who spent three days in the fort in 1664: The fortress remained like this until the 17th century, when, due to the Austro-Turkish wars, the fortification was again expanded and upgraded. After the Austrian withdrawal in 1738 following another war, the Turks again reconstructed the fort, including the citadel's tower. With Austrian incursions and Serbian rebellions, the fortress was in this period variously held by the Ottomans, Austrians and Serbs. By the protocols of the 1862 Kanlƒ±ca Conference, the Turks had to evacuate some of the fortresses they held in, now, autonomous Serbia. There were six in total, and one of them was U≈æice. The protocols, signed by the ruling prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá, also stipulated that the abandoned fortresses had to be demolished and made unusable for any future military purpose. The fort was mined and destroyed in January 1863.  Present  View on the Stari Grad (left), modern town of U≈æice (upper right), and the ƒêetinja river (right The remnants of the ramparts, towers and buildings, up to one meter tall, survived. They were reduced to that height during the 1863 demolition. Acting as a blueprint, they allow to envision the former appearance of the complex. From 2000 to 2002, there was a summer theatre stage on the top.  Characteristics  Stari Grad is a typical medieval fortress built for the melee weapon fighting. The base is elongated and irregularly shaped, which was needed to adjust it to the topographic relief. Smaller section of the town was located at the highest point. It was isolated and well fortified, with ramparts including the donjon. The other, lower part of the town, was encircled by the walls which descended along the ridge's edge all the way to the river. On its bank, there was a water tower, which supplied the town. The town is divided in three sections: upper town, middle town and lower (or water) town. Although the smallest, the upper town is the most visible. The entrance into the fort is located on the northwest side. The inner space directly from the entrance was a fortified outer bailey. South of the entrance there are remains of the lagums, underground rooms. There are two of them, embedded into the rock and interconnected. They served as the shelter and a weapons magazine. The ramparts elevate up to above the river. The upper town was connected to the lowest section at the ƒêetinja bank with 168 steps. The fortress allows for an excellent overview on the entire U≈æice depression and the western section of the West Pomoravlje.  Reconstruction  Works, which included the archaeological survey, conservation and partial restoration were conducted from 1973 to 1984. Cleaning of the fortress from garbage and overgrowth began in 2014. Cleaning and minor preparations continued until 2016 when the decision on reconstructing the remains was announced. Basically a continuation of the 1980s works, the reconstruction ensued in August 2017. The reconstruction of the upper town, middle town and water tower was planned. Part was to be conserved and part should be repaired. In 2017 and 2018 the upper town and parts of the middle town were conserved in order the prevent further decay. Partially reconstructed citadel's tower was adapted into the scenic viewpoint. A possible modernization of the feature, which would include the bridge connecting the fortress with the Zlatibor road, cable car, museum, hotel, etc., was also considered by the city administration. In may 2019 it was confirmed that the long pedestrian bridge across the ƒêetinja to the fortress will be built. The fortress itself will be reconstructed and partially rebuilt based on the detailed Austrian plans from 1737 (when Austrians held it for less than 2 years), which have been kept in the War Archive in Vienna. The tower, citadel at the top and the casemate will be completely rebuilt. Works are scheduled to start in the spring of 2020. Concurrently, the projects for the conservation of the remaining part of the middle town and of the entire lower town are drafted. Middle town will be fully reconstructed, with artisan village built within. The citadel tower will host artistic exhibitions while the plateau around it will serve for various cultural and public gatherings. Better access will be enabled via the bridge to the old gate entrance. The citadel will be decorated with lights.  Tourism  The plans are to include the reconstructed fortress into the group of tourist attractions located along the ƒêetinja. In January 2019 construction of the replica of the Neolithic settlement at Staparska Gradina was announced. The settlement will include dug outs, stilt houses, artisan workshops, etc. Right below the Stari Grad there is a small hydroelectrical power plant on the ƒêetinja. Named ‚ÄúPod Gradom‚Äù (‚ÄúBelow the town‚Äù), it is the oldest one in Serbia and on the Balkans, second oldest in Europe and third oldest in the world after Niagara in United States and was also designed according to Nikola Tesla's principles. It was built only 4 years after the Niagara. Undeveloped Staparska Banja (\\"Stapari Spa\\") with several thermal springs is also located in the gorge. In 2017 a pedestrian and bicycle path was built which reached the spa. Though two pools were constructed and there are swimmers, the spa is basically a mudflat. Thermal waters, with the temperature of help with the rheumatism and skin diseases. Along the new path, which follows the route of the former railroad, there are additional, old pathways, dating from the Ottoman period. In July 2017 volunteers organized and cleaned those old paths, removed the overgrowth and made of old paths accessible for the pedestrians. The path now starts at the U≈æice city beach and curves through the natural environment for to Staparska Banja.

It is a drinking water reservoir for Edinburgh and the Lothians and is located above sea level. It is an important site for wildfowl and is designated as a SSSI and a Ramsar site. Description Westwater reservoir was opened in 1969 with an earthwork dam on the West Water, a tributary of the Lyne Water which, in turn, is a tributary of the River Tweed. The reservoir has an area of . The reservoir is surrounded by the North Slipperfield Estate which manages the land for rough grazing and shooting. Archaeology Erosion caused by the creation of the reservoir exposed an Early Bronze Age flat cist cemetery. When this was excavated the archaeologists found nine surviving cists. These contained remains from both inhumations and cremations and most of the deceased were sub-adult or young adults. Evidence of floral tributes was found in three burials and grave goods were also found. Abstract Fishing Westwater reservoir is used by fly fishing anglers and is stocked with brown trout. The fishing rights were transferred from Scottish Water to the local angling club in 2003. Conservation Westwater Reservoir is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Ramsar site. The reason for this is that in the autumn and winter the reservoir is host to a large roost of pink-footed geese which, in the years 2003‚Äì2008 had an average peak number of over 40,000 birds, almost 115 of the total population of this species. In addition to the pink-footed geese there is a diverse community of wildlife around the reservoir including breeding common gull, common ringed plover, dunlin and common tern. Other important wintering and passage species include common goldeneye, barnacle goose, tufted duck and Eurasian teal.

He also worked in Moscow and frescoed churches in Kiev. His preferred medium was oil, but he also painted miniatures and icons. Life and work Alexei was born to the family of a government official who worked in the Armory and in the \\"–ö–∞–Ω—Ü–µ–ª—è—Ä–∏—è –æ—Ç —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω–∏–π\\" (Chancellory of Buildings). Beginning in 1732, Alexei worked at the Chancellory under his relative Andrey Matveyev. After 1739 he was a member of the \\"painting team\\" of the Chancellory under Ivan Vishnyakov. As a member of the team Alexei took part in the frescoeing of the Summer Palace, Winter Palace, Anichkov Palace and other buildings of Saint Petersburg. He also studied portrait art from the court painter Louis Caravaque of France. In 1749 Alexei received the rank of the Painter's Apprentice and at the end of the 1750s the rank of the Master Painter. In 1752-1755 he worked on the interiors of the St Andrew's Church of Kiev. He supervised the installation of the iconostasis and frescoed cupolas and walls. The most prominent of his frescoes in the church is the Last Supper in the altar. He started to paint portraits before his Kiev period. The earliest known portraits of his are portraits of Elizabeth of Russia. He did not meet his model, but based the paintings on the works of his teacher, Louis Caravaque. Unknown lady, 1760s From 1755 to 1757 he worked in Moscow frescoeing the Golovkin palace. Here he met prince Ivan Shuvalov who supported Antropov's work for the rest of his life. From 1757 to 1759 Antropov returned to Saint-Petersburg and obtained further instruction from court painter Pietro Rotari of Italy. Historians consider his portrait of A.M. Izmaylova to be a sort of a graduation work. The 1760s were probably the most productive period of the artist. He painted many good portraits among the Portrait of Ataman Krasnoschekov, Portrait of Rumyantseva. Ivan Shuvalov planned to move him to Moscow, so Antropov could teach art the Moscow University. For some reason this plan was cancelled and Antropov instead got the job at the Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church, there he supervised icon painting, decorated the churches, drew the portraits of church hierarchs and supervised art students. Among his apprentices was Dmitry Levitzky, who actually lived in his teacher's house. In 1762 Peter III of Russia became the new Emperor. Antropov soon became his favorite painter. For the six months of Peter III's rule, Antropov painted at least four of his portraits. After the palace revolt, the new Empress, Catherine II had a much lower opinion of Antropov's talents. At that time, artists preferred a soft combinations of colors and some flattering for the ceremonial portraits. Antropov preferred the traditional icon and parsuna portraits, based on a sharp contrast of colors with a dark background. In 1789 Antropov made a personal sacrifice, transferring his only house to the Department of Education for organizing a Free School there. In 1795 Antropov died of a fever and was buried in the Lazarevskoe Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, in Saint Petersburg.

Hawaiian kapa from the 18th century. Barkcloth or bark cloth is a versatile material that was once a treasure in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. Barkcloth comes primarily from trees of the family Moraceae, including Broussonetia papyrifera, Artocarpus altilis, and Ficus natalensis. It is made by beating sodden strips of the fibrous inner bark of these trees into sheets, which are then finished into a variety of items. Many texts that mention \\"paper\\" clothing are actually referring to barkcloth. Some modern cotton-based fabrics are also named \\"barkcloth\\" for their resemblance to these traditional fabrics. Traditional =Austronesia= Before the development of woven textiles, barkcloth made from trees belonging to the mulberry family (Moraceae) were an important aspect of the pre-Austronesian and Austronesian material culture during the Neolithic period. Stone barkcloth beaters, in particular, are considered part of the \\"Austronesian toolkit.\\" They have been found in abundance in the Pearl River basin in Southern China, which is considered to be part of the homelands of the Austronesian peoples before they started migrating into islands during the Austronesian expansion (c.3000 to 1500 BC). The oldest example, found in the Dingmo Site in Guangxi, has been dated back to ~5900 BC. They were spread along with Austronesian voyagers into Island Southeast Asia, Oceania (with the notable exception of Micronesia), and Madagascar. Genetic studies on the paper mulberry populations in the Pacific have all confirmed close genealogical ties to populations in Taiwan and Southern China. Though they exist in abundance in archaeological sites in Island Southeast Asia, barkcloth have largely disappeared in the region as they were replaced by woven textiles. But they survived until around the 19th century in the outlying regions of the Austronesian expansion, particularly in Island Melanesia and Polynesia, as well as the interior highlands of Borneo. Some communities in Southeast Asia are reviving this practice. At Monbang traditional village on Alor Island, Indonesia, tourists can see members of the Kabola ethnic group wear barkcloth and dance traditional dances. =Uganda= Barkcloth has been manufactured in Uganda for centuries and is Uganda's sole representative on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. Modern cotton \\"barkcloth\\" Barkcloth- style skirt weight cotton Today, what is commonly called barkcloth is a soft, thick, slightly textured fabric, so named because it has a rough surface like that of tree bark. This barkcloth is usually made of densely woven cotton fibers. Historically, the fabric has been used in home furnishings, such as curtains, drapery, upholstery, and slipcovers. It is often associated with 1940s through 1960s home fashions, particularly in tropical, abstract, \\"atomic\\" and \\"boomerang\\" prints, the last two themes being expressed by images of atoms with electrons whirling, and by the boomerang shape which was very popular in mid-century cocktail tables and fabrics and influenced by the Las Vegas \\"Atomic City\\" era.

The record showcased the two sides of the act, with the album's first single \\"Fight the Power\\" reflecting a fast-paced funk vibe while showcasing a ballad side on the latter. The song later became a crossover hit for the brothers. History =Recording= By 1975, most of the songwriting within the Isley Brothers had changed. Prior to their arrivals in 1973, original members Ron, Kelly and Rudy had written a majority of their recordings after reviving their T-Neck Records label in 1969. After the release of 3 + 3, their 1973 release, most of the brothers' compositions were devised by multi-instrumentalists Ernie Isley and Chris Jasper with minimal composition help by bassist Marvin Isley. According to engineers Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff, the way the band conducted business was workmanlike in comparison with the more laid back Stevie Wonder, with whom Cecil and Margouleff worked on several of Wonder's so-called \\"classic albums\\" during the 1970s period. Cecil described the band's eldest brother O'Kelly as a taskmaster and was always directing his younger brothers and Jasper. Younger brother and prominent lead vocalist Ron was described as shy while Ernie Isley was described as a genius. Recording of the song took place at Burbank's Kendun Recorders studio. The song had been composed by Ernie Isley and Chris Jasper based on a poem written for Jasper's sister Elaine by her husband and Jasper's brother-in-law Rudy Isley. Jasper wrote the music while Ernie Isley composed the lyrics. Initially during the song's first take, Cecil and Margouleff had accidentally erased the vocals. Although upset by the initial failure of them erasing what he felt was a perfect take of the song, Ron Isley recorded his take again and by the song's finish had told the engineers that he was going home. Release \\"For the Love of You\\" was released in September 1975, after the success of its predecessor, \\"Fight the Power\\", had started to dwindle, leading to a drop of the charts. \\"For the Love\\" nearly repeated the success of its predecessor reaching #22 on the Billboard Hot 100, giving the brothers the rarity of having two top 40 singles off one album as opposed to one every album, marking it as the first time that had happened since the 1972 album, Brother, Brother, Brother, where two top 40 singles emerged from that album (\\"Work to Do\\" and \\"Pop That Thang\\"). The song peaked at #10 on Billboard's R&B; chart. The song's success was contributed to the album's sequencing in which the harder, funk and rock-oriented first three tracks were placed on side one, while the more melodic, sensual soul ballads were placed on side two. As a result of the success of \\"For the Love of You\\", R&B; radio began playing the album's other two ballads regularly ‚Äì the O'Kelly Isley-led ballad \\"Sensuality\\" and the Ronald swan song, \\"Make Me Say It Again, Girl\\". Since then, all three of the songs from the album's second side continued to get play on quiet storm radio playlists.

Course  The Nadela originates from the Boto≈° sluice gate on the Canal Danube-Tisa-Danube-Tami≈° crossing, at an altitude of . This is just the first of the many sluice gates on the river's course (Toma≈°evac, Uzdin, Putnikovo, Kovaƒçica, Debeljaƒça) which channel the waters into the southern direction. Near the village of Uzdin, Nadela's waters are used for the Uzdin fish pond. Until Debeljaƒça the Nadela (in this section also called Veliki kanal or big canal) flows as the real river, but after the Debeljaƒça catchment for the purpose of irrigation, the river shrinks in terms of volume and discharge to the level of a brooklet, which combined with the use of water for industry in Jabuka and Panƒçevo down the stream and small inclination of the watershed (mouth at ) means that without sluice gates pumps to push the water, the river would stop flowing. The Nadela continues to the south, close to the villages (each with its own sluice gate) of Crepaja, Jabuka, the town of Panƒçevo, Starƒçevo, Omoljica and Ivanovo, where it empties into the Danube, creating an ada (river island), Ivanovo Ostrvo. The Nadela receives several tributaries and canals, mostly in its latter section: Verovac, Dolovaƒçki Begej, Crepajski kanal, Srednji Begej, Ponjavica, etc. It belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin and it is not navigable.  Hydrosystem  The whole course of the Nadela is organized as one hydrosystem. Water is mostly used for irrigation of some of arable land and for the use in industrial facilities in Jabuka and Panƒçevo. The river is also used as a drainage canal for the industrial waters (especially from the heavily industrialized Panƒçevo) which results in the Nadela's extreme pollution in the lower course. In early 2016 a group of local enthusiasts and fishermen organized in an attempt to clean the area of Nadela between Starƒçevo and Omoljica. Up to that point, the area was severely polluted both from the industrial and agrarian pollution. The concrete overspill station, which kept the constant level of water in the river, was buried under the illegal waste dump so the river at one point completely dried out. They cleaned and dredged the canal, arranged the banks and the surrounding area, adapting it for picnics and recreation. The overspill was also cleaned and restored to its previous function, so the water level was raised by . That way, the lake-like widening of the river, with an area of was restored, while the surrounding basin of was revitalized and from the dried land restored to wetland. A series of sluice gates serve for several purposes: * in upper part of the course, to prevent the waters of the Tami≈° to spill over during high water levels in rainy years. * in central part, to prevent the Nadela to spill over itself, during rainy periods and abundance of underground waters. * in southern part, to prevent the waters of the Danube to spill over during high water levels and to constantly regulate inverse flow of the Danube waters as a result of the ƒêerdap hydroelectric power plant construction.

At the band's inception, Hartman was the sole drummer. However, in late 1971, the group added second drummer Michael Hossack, and the dual-drummers formation has persisted ever since. (Hossack was replaced in 1973 by Keith Knudsen.) Hartman played on all of the Doobie Brothers' major hits of the 1970s with both Tom Johnston and Michael McDonald. He left early in 1979 following a promotional tour in support of the award-winning Minute by Minute album to look after Arabian horses on his California ranch. Hartman was enticed to join twelve Doobies alumni (including drummers Hossack, Knudsen, and Hartman's own 1979 replacement Chet McCracken) for a brief benefit tour in 1987. Hartman subsequently rejoined when the band was reconstituted the following year. He played on the reunion albums Cycles (1989) and Brotherhood (1991) as well as the accompanying promotional tours. However, following a 1992 alumni reunion for the benefit of terminally ill percussionist Bobby LaKind, Hartman retired permanently from the band. In typical Doobies fashion, he was replaced by his former partner, Keith Knudsen.

Biography He was a serf belonging to Count Sheremetev and had grown up in the family of his uncle, Semyon Mikhaylovich Argunov, who was a steward of princess Cherkassky and later a majordomo for count Sheremetev. For many years Semyon managed Sheremetev's house on Millionnaya Street in Saint Petersburg, the house where Ivan grew up. In 1746‚Äì1749 Ivan Argunov studied painting with a German artist named Georg Grooth who at the time was in the employ of the Empress Elizabeth of Russia. Ivan also got lessons from his cousins Fedor Leontyevich Argunov and Fedor Semenovich Argunov, painters working in Saint- Petersburg on decorating the Imperial residences. Portrait of an unknown peasant, 1784 Argunov's first works were icons for the Palace Church in Great Tsarskoe Selo Palace (1753) and for the New Jerusalem Monastery (1749). At that time he also created his only known historical painting Dying Cleopatra. His earliest known portraits were of Prince Ivan Ivanovich Lobanov-Rostovsky (1752) and Princess Ekaterina Alexandrovna Lobanova-Rostovskaya (1754). There can be seen the old traditions of traditional Russian Parsuna art mixed with the new Baroque influence. In 1760s Argunov was in his prime. He created many beautiful parade and psychological portraits and icons. Among his subjects were Russian royalty and of course Argunov's masters the Sheremetevs as well as their relatives the Lazarevs and the counts Tolstoy. He was one of the creators of the genre of posthumous portraits, painting many dead Sheremetevs. In 1770 Argunov became the major-domo for the Sheremetevs' house on Millionnaya Street, then the major-domo of the Moscow house of the Sheremetevs, then one of the stewards for their estates (chlen krepostnoj kollegii grafov Sheremetevs). He painted much less but it was in that time (1784) he created his masterpiece Portrait of an Unknown Woman in Peasant Dress. The identity of the sitter for the painting remains uncertain, whilst studies have suggested that she was the serf actress and singer of the counts Sheremetev, Anna Kovalyova-Zhemchugova, it has equally been supposed that it was not in fact an official portrait of her, but rather an image of an unidentified wet nurse, taken from amongst the Seremetevs' serfs.Richard Stites, 'Serfdom, Society , and the Arts in Imperial Russia', p. 333 Between the second half of 1780s until his death in 1802 Argunov did not paint but spent all his time managing different estates and businesses of the Sheremetevs. Argunov was an important teacher of art. He taught painting classes beginning in 1753 ‚Äî before the opening of the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1757. Among his students were Anton Losenko, Fyodor Rokotov, Kirill Golovachevsky and Ivan Sablukov ‚Äî all four future teachers of the Academy. Argunov's sons were also his pupils. Two of them: (Nikolay Argunov and Yakov Argunov) became painters, while the third (Pavel Argunov) became an architect.

The game, won by the Chargers in overtime, 41‚Äì38, is one of the most famous in National Football League lore because of the conditions on the field, the performances of players on both teams, and the numerous records that were set.1981 Miami Playoff Game Many former players, coaches and writers assert it as one of the greatest games in NFL history. It was also referred to in the Miami Herald as the \\"Miracle That Died\\", while Sports Illustrated dubbed it the \\"Game No One Should Have Lost\\". The game aired on NBC with Don Criqui and John Brodie calling the action and Bryant Gumbel serving as the anchor, one of his final assignments for NBC Sports as he began co-hosting Today two days after the game. Background The Dolphins finished the 1981 regular season by winning the AFC East with an 11‚Äì4‚Äì1 record. Their offense was led by quarterbacks David Woodley and Don Strock. Woodley had a rather mediocre year, throwing for only 2,470 yards (6.7 yards per throw) and 12 touchdowns, with 13 interceptions and a passer rating of only 69.8, but he was a good scrambler, gaining 272 yards and four touchdowns on the ground. Strock was widely considered to be one of the best reserve quarterbacks in the league and had played in 15 of 16 regular-season games,Don Strock Past Stats, Statistics, History, and Awards ‚Äì databaseFootball.com completing 79 of 130 passes for 901 yards (6.7 yards per throw) with six touchdowns and eight interceptions. Receivers Jimmy Cefalo (29 receptions, 631 yards, three touchdowns) and Duriel Harris (53 receptions, 911 yards, two touchdowns) provided the main deep threat on the team. Halfback Tony Nathan was the top rusher on the Dolphins with 782 yards on just 147 carries, giving him a league-leading 5.3-yards-per-carry average, while also catching 50 passes for 432 yards and scoring eight touchdowns. Fullback Andra Franklin provided the team with good blocking, and he was also a good ball carrier, rushing for 711 yards and seven touchdowns; the Dolphins run game in its entirety totaled 2,173 yards (4.06 yards per carry) and 18 touchdowns. Miami's offensive line was anchored by Pro Bowl guard Ed Newman and center Dwight Stephenson. Bob Baumhower was an integral part of Miami's storied defensive line in 1981. Miami's defense ranked fifth in the NFL in fewest points allowed (275). Pro Bowl defensive tackle Bob Baumhower anchored the line, while linebackers A. J. Duhe and Earnie Rhone excelled at blitzing and pass coverage, combining for four interceptions. The Dolphins' secondary, consisting of Mike Kozlowski, Fulton Walker and brothers Lyle and Glenn Blackwood was also extremely talented. The Dolphins had allowed just 27 points in their last three games prior to their playoff matchup against San Diego. San Diego won their 3rd straight AFC West title in 1981 with a 10‚Äì6 record, based on a better division record over Denver, who also finished 10‚Äì6. The Chargers' high-powered offense led the NFL in scoring (478 points), passing yards (4,739), and total yards (6,744). Quarterback Dan Fouts made the Pro Bowl for the third year in a row, completing 360 of 609 passes for an NFL record 4,802 yards and 33 touchdowns, with only 17 interceptions. His favorite targets were receivers Charlie Joiner (70 receptions, 1,188 yards, seven touchdowns) and Wes Chandler (52 receptions, 857 yards, five touchdowns in 12 games with San Diego. Chandler replaced John Jefferson after Jefferson, following a contract dispute, was traded to Green Bay early in the season.), along with Pro Bowl tight end Kellen Winslow (88 receptions, 1,075 yards, 10 touchdowns). San Diego also had an outstanding rushing attack, led by Pro Bowl running back Chuck Muncie, who rushed for 1,144 yards and a league-leading 19 touchdowns, while also catching 43 passes for 362 yards. Rookie running back James Brooks was also a major contributor, rushing for 525 yards, catching 46 passes for 329 yards, and adding another 1,239 yards returning punts and kickoffs. Up front, their line was anchored by Pro Bowl guard Doug Wilkerson. However, San Diego's defense ranked only 26th in the league (at the time there were only 28 teams) in points allowed (390) and 27th in total yards allowed (6,520). Defensive tackle Gary Johnson from the Chargers defense made the Pro Bowl, and fellow tackle Louie Kelcher was named Second Team All-Pro. Defensive back Willie Buchanon led the team with five interceptions. The game =First quarter= Chuck Muncie led the game in rushes with 120 yards while scoring a touchdown in the first quarter. San Diego started out the game by driving down the field, featuring a 47-yard completion from Dan Fouts to Wes Chandler on 3rd and 14, and scoring with kicker Rolf Benirschke's 32-yard field goal. The Chargers' defense then forced Miami to punt on its ensuing possession, and Chandler returned the ball 56 yards for a touchdown, increasing his team's lead to 10‚Äì0. Then on the ensuing kickoff, the Chargers caught a break when the high, short kick surprisingly bounced back in their direction and was recovered by San Diego. Several plays later, Chuck Muncie scored on a 1-yard touchdown run. Then on the Dolphins' next drive, David Woodley was intercepted by Chargers safety Glen Edwards, who returned the ball 35 yards, setting up Fouts' 8-yard touchdown pass to James Brooks. By the time the first quarter ended, San Diego had a commanding 24‚Äì0 lead. It looked like the outcome of the game was already decided. =Second quarter= After Miami's next drive resulted in an incompletion, two sacks, and a fumble (which Miami recovered), coach Don Shula replaced Woodley with Don Strock early in the second quarter to see whether he could spark the Dolphins offense, and that's precisely what he did, completing a 17-yard pass to Duriel Harris on his first play and leading them down the field to score their first points of the game on a 34-yard field goal by Uwe von Schamann. The Dolphins defense forced and recovered a fumble by Fouts on the ensuing drive, giving the ball back to the offense with great field position on the Chargers 39-yard line. Several plays later, Strock converted the turnover into points with a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Joe Rose, cutting the deficit to 24‚Äì10. Later in the quarter, San Diego faced a fourth down on the Dolphins 37-yard line. The Chargers decided to send in Benirschke to attempt a 55-yard field goal, but he missed, giving the ball back to the Dolphins near midfield. Three plays later, Miami moved the ball to San Diego's 40-yard line with only six seconds left in the half and an attempt at one last play. In a play known as a \\"hook and lateral\\", Strock took the snap and threw to Duriel Harris at the right side of the 25-yard line. Harris caught the ball and immediately lateraled it outside and back to the trailing Tony Nathan. The Chargers defense was completely surprised and Nathan took it untouched for 29 yards down the sideline and a touchdown to cut the deficit to 24‚Äì17.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUHqAxXjSs8 Going into the locker rooms at halftime, the Dolphins had closed the game to within one score and regained the momentum. =Third and fourth quarters= Miami's momentum continued into the second half. Early in the third quarter, Strock led the Dolphins 74 yards down the field and finished the drive with a 15-yard touchdown pass to Rose, tying the game at 24. But this time, San Diego managed to counter with a score of its own. Fouts led the Chargers 60 yards in six plays, scoring on a 25-yard touchdown pass to Kellen Winslow to regain the lead. However, Miami stormed right back with Strock completing numerous passes, the last one a 50-yard scoring strike to tight end Bruce Hardy, tying the game again at 31. With less than a minute left in the third quarter, San Diego receiver Charlie Joiner slipped while running a deep post route, causing Fouts' pass to go right into the arms of Miami's Lyle Blackwood. After intercepting the pass, Blackwood quickly lateraled the ball to Gerald Small, who returned it to the Chargers 15-yard line, setting up Nathan's 12-yard touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter and giving Miami its first lead of the game. Later in the quarter, with the Dolphins just trying to maintain their lead and run out the clock, Chargers defensive tackle Louie Kelcher stripped Dolphins running back Andra Franklin of the ball, which was recovered by San Diego safety Pete Shaw on San Diego's 18-yard line with 4:39 left in regulation. Fouts then led his team down to Miami's nine-yard line. With only 58 seconds left in regulation, a heavy Dolphins pass rush forced Fouts to throw a blind pass intended for Winslow in the end zone. The pass sailed over Winslow's head, but went right into the arms of Brooks for a touchdown to tie the game. In an interview with NFL Network for its program \\"America's Game: The Missing Rings\\", Fouts later explained Brooks was not even supposed to be a receiver on the play. Brooks had been assigned to stay in the backfield as a blocker, but with no Miami players coming at him from his side of the field, he decided to run a pass route into the end zone, and by simply running in the same direction as Fouts, he just happened to end up in the right spot to catch the pass intended for Winslow. Miami took over on its own 40-yard line following Benirschke's squib kick, needing only a field goal to win. Following an incomplete pass, Strock's next throw was intercepted by Willie Buchanon, but as he made the diving catch, he fumbled the ball back to Miami when he hit the ground. After that, Nathan's 17-yard reception and Tommy Vigorito's 6-yard run moved the Dolphins to the Chargers 26-yard line where von Schamann attempted a 43-yard field goal, but at the last second, Winslow extended his 6'5\\" frame at the line just enough to deflect the kick with his fingers, causing it to fall short of the goal post and sending the game into overtime. =Overtime= With the players of both teams exhausted and dehydrated, everyone was hoping for a quick end to overtime, but that would not be the case. San Diego won the coin toss and marched down the field, driving inside the Dolphins 10-yard line. Benirschke then attempted a game-winning, 27-yard field goal, but a bad snap and poor hold threw off his timing and the kick sailed wide left. Miami then drove deep into Chargers territory, setting up a 35-yard field goal attempt for von Schamann, but his kick was low, and defensive lineman Leroy Jones managed to leap in the air and block it. San Diego took over at its own 16-yard line after the blocked field goal. Aided by a pair of receptions by Chandler and a 39-yard catch by Joiner, Fouts led his team 74 yards to Miami's 10-yard line, where Benirschke attempted a 29-yard field goal. This time, his kick was good, giving the Chargers a 41‚Äì38 win after 13 minutes and 52 seconds of overtime play. =Post-game quotes= Said Chargers coach Don Coryell after the game: > \\"I have coached for 31 or 32 years and this is tremendous...There has never > been a game like this.

The game featured many new records by players of both teams. By the time it was over Miami and San Diego had set playoff records for the most points scored by both teams (79), most total yards by both teams (1,036), and most passing yards by both teams (809). Strock had the best single game performance of his career, completing 29 of 43 passes for 403 yards and four touchdowns, a record that still stands for a quarterback coming off the bench. Harris caught six passes for 106 yards. Nathan rushed for 48 yards, caught nine passes for 114 yards, and scored two touchdowns. Hardy caught five passes for 89 yards and a touchdown. Fouts finished the game completing 33 of 53 passing attempts for a franchise record 433 yards and three touchdowns. His attempts, completions, and passing yards were all NFL postseason records.History: The Classic Shootout ‚Äì Pro Football Hall of Fame Joiner caught seven passes for 108 yards. Muncie rushed for 124 yards and a touchdown. In addition to his 56-yard punt return touchdown, Chandler caught six passes for 106 yards. Brooks recorded 143 all-purpose yards (19 rushing, 31 receiving, 85 kickoff return, eight punt return) and a pair of touchdown catches.Playoff Classic in '81 Pro Football Hall of Fame. Accessed 12 July 2007. But perhaps the best performance of the game was put in by Kellen Winslow. In addition to his blocked field goal, he recorded an NFL playoff record 13 receptions for 166 yards and a touchdown, despite suffering numerous injuries. During the contest, he was treated for a pinched nerve in his shoulder, dehydration, severe cramps, and a gash in his lower lip that required three stitches. A picture of an exhausted Winslow being helped off the field by two teammates after the game is an enduring image in NFL lore and has been replayed constantly ever since. \\"I've never felt so close to death before,\\" Winslow said afterward. \\"That's what Muhammad Ali said in Manila and that's how I felt out there at the end.\\" Aftermath =San Diego Chargers= One week after their victory over the Dolphins in Florida's scorching heat, the Chargers traveled to Cincinnati to face the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC championship game in the coldest game in NFL history based on the wind chill. The air temperature was ‚àí9 ¬∞F (‚àí23 ¬∞C), and wind chill was ‚àí59 ¬∞F (‚àí51 ¬∞C). This ended up being another famous game in NFL lore, and has since become known as the Freezer Bowl. But this time, it did not end well for the Chargers, they were defeated 27‚Äì7 by the Bengals, ending the Chargers season one game short of the Super Bowl for the second consecutive year. The following season, which was shortened to nine games because of a players strike, Fouts led the Chargers to a 6‚Äì3 record and back to the divisional playoffs with a 31‚Äì28 wildcard win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, throwing for 333 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions. But this time, they could not make it to the AFC title game, losing a divisional game to the Dolphins 34‚Äì13. The loss to Miami in the playoffs after the 1982 season was the last postseason game that Fouts, Winslow, Joiner, and coach Coryell would ever participate in, as the Chargers did not return to the postseason again until 1992. Fouts, Winslow and Joiner all went on to be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, without playing in a Super Bowl. The only significant contributors in the Epic in Miami who did go to a Super Bowl were Brooks, who made it to Super Bowl XXIII as a member of the Bengals, guard Ed White, who was a Minnesota Viking for four Super Bowls and Gary \\"Big Hands\\" Johnson, who joined former Chargers, and fellow \\"Bruise Brothers\\" Louie Kelcher and Fred Dean (who had been traded to eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco after Week 5, also due to contract problems) winning Super Bowl XIX with the San Francisco 49ers. The Chargers' victory in this game would be the last time that they defeated the Dolphins in Miami until 2019, by which time the Chargers had moved to Los Angeles. =Miami Dolphins= Woodley recovered from his poor performance in the Epic in Miami and regained his position as the Dolphins starting quarterback in the following season. In the strike shortened 1982 NFL season, David Woodley led Miami to a 7‚Äì2 record and 3 playoff wins to lead the Miami Dolphins to an NFL championship appearance in Super Bowl XVII. One of the playoff wins was a 34‚Äì13 divisional win against the Chargers, avenging their loss from the previous season. This time, Woodley was a key contributor for his team, completing 17 of 22 passes for 195 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception, while also rushing for 14 yards and a touchdown on the ground. Miami's defense also dominated Fouts, limiting him to 15 of 34 completions and intercepting him five times. However, Miami ended up losing Super Bowl XVII to the Washington Redskins, 27‚Äì17. With the exception of a 76-yard touchdown pass to Jimmy Cefalo in the first quarter, Woodley had a poor performance, completing only 4 of 14 passes for 97 yards and one touchdown, with one interception. The following season, Woodley lost his starting spot to rookie Dan Marino. Woodley was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1984 and spent the rest of his career as a backup before retiring after the 1985 season. Don Strock's incredible performance in the Epic in Miami ended up being the main highlight of his career. He spent the rest of his career as a backup and retired after 1988 as a backup for the Cleveland Browns. Miami made it back to the Super Bowl in 1984, but they lost Super Bowl XIX to the San Francisco 49ers 38‚Äì16. None of the primary players in the Epic in Miami ever won a Super Bowl ring, except for left guard Bob Kuechenberg, who was a member of the Dolphins' Super Bowl-winning teams in 1972 and 1973. Two participants, coach Don Shula and center Dwight Stephenson, were enshrined in the Hall of Fame.

Bush issued a Military Order titled Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism.Presidential Military Order: Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism, The White House, November 13, 2001 The order: #Defines which individuals the President considers subject to the order. #States that the U.S. Secretary of Defense will be ultimately responsible for the individuals. #Outlines the conditions under which the Secretary of Defense should detain the individuals. #Specifies that those individuals who were to be tried would be tried before military commissions, and sets out some broad guidelines for how those military commissions should be conducted. #Orders other agencies to assist the Secretary of Defense. #Grants the Secretary of Defense additional powers. #Specifies the relationship of the order to other laws and forums. #States that the order will be published in the Federal Register. Background and controversy In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the Bush administration sought \\"a tough-minded alternative to the civilian court system\\" for dealing with terrorists. President Bush asserted that the U.S. Constitution and a congressional resolution passed after the attack empowered him to promulgate the order as president. The order provided the authority for the Secretary of Defense to detain members of Al Qaeda at Guantanamo Bay. Critics pointed out that, as of March 2006, none of the cases for the 10 terrorists designated for trial under the order had been concluded. They also argued that the suspects were tried for crimes defined by the President, using procedures \\"lacking basic protections\\", by judges who were subordinates of the President. Ultimately the commissions were modified to require that trials be public and defendants be assumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. However critics continued to argue that the Geneva Convention required the detainees to be tried in federal court with habeas corpus. The Bush administration countered that Al Qaeda is a terrorist network that has not signed the Geneva Convention and does not abide by it. Judicial branch ruled the commissions unconstitutional US District Court Justice James Robertson ruled, in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, that the military commissions were unconstitutional. A three-judge appeals panel overturned Robertson's ruling. President Bush appointed John Roberts, one of the judges on that panel, to the vacant post of Chief Justice of the United States on the next business day. Justice John Roberts had to recuse himself when the appeal appeared before the United States Supreme Court. On June 29, 2006, the Supreme Court upheld Robertson's initial ruling 5-3. That ruling was later superseded by the Military Commissions Act of 2006.  March 13 standard  Charlie Savage points to a more legalized understanding of which individuals could be detained under the Authorization for Use of Military Force under the Obama Administration. He states that the standard became known as the \\"March 13 standard.\\" It is in reference to a memorandum regarding the United States Government's detention of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. The standard put forth in the memo for determining whether an individual could be detained (outside of those individuals directly tied into the September 11 attacks) is if the person: * Was part of or ** the Taliban or ** al-Qaida forces or ** associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a belligerent act, or has directly supported hostilities, in aid of such enemy armed forces; or * Substantially supported ** the Taliban or ** al- Qaida forces or ** associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a belligerent act, or has directly supported hostilities, in aid of such enemy armed forces.Brief for Respondent at 2, In re Guantanamo Bay Detainee Litigation, Misc.

The love of the German way, called \\"Germanophilia\\" or \\"Teutonophilia\\", is the opposite to Germanophobia. History The term \\"Germanophile\\" came into common use in the 19th to 20th centuries Ngram chart of usage  after the 1871 formation of the German Empire and its subsequent rise in importance. It is used not only politically but also culturally; for example, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831), the famous, influential German philosopher, interpreted the geographic triad of Europe as comprising England (utilitarian pragmatism), France (revolutionary hastiness), and Germany (reflective thoroughness). In 19th-century romanticism in Britain, the term's antonym was Scandophile, expressing a dichotomy of associating Anglo- Saxon culture either with continental West Germanic culture or with North Germanic (Scandinavian) culture (the \\"Viking revival\\"). The term was also used in opposition to Hellenophile, with an affinity to \\"Teutonic\\" or Germanic culture and worldview seen as opposed to a predilection for Classical Antiquity. In 19th-century Continental Europe, the dichotomy was rather between Germany and France, the main political players of the period, and a Germanophile would choose to side with Germany against French or \\"Romance\\" interests taken to heart by a Francophile. The corresponding term relating to England is Anglophile, an affinity, in turn, often observed in early-20th- century Germans choosing to side against French influence. This term was also popularly used in the 20th century to refer to the German educational system formed by Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767-1835), which was leading in the early 1800s and served as a model for many elite universities around the world from Oslo to Harvard. A number of Serb elites in the 19th century and in the Interwar period were staunch Germanophiles.
